Hundreds of Florida Puffer Fish Wash Ashore
-----------------------------------------------------
Hundreds of puffer fish have washed up on southwestern Florida beaches, and
scientists were investigating whether they were killed by natural
toxins. Close to 700 of the striped burrfish were collected Tuesday and
Wednesday from a 2-mile stretch of Bonita Beach, said beach supervisor
Clyde Lanning; 4 were sent to the state for testing. Results are expected
next week.
The scientists will test for red tide, an [effect caused by] algae that
produces toxins fatal to many kinds of fish, and saxitoxin, suspected of
causing 19 cases of food poisoning last year in Florida, New Jersey, and
Virginia, said state scientist Jan Landsberg.
The victims became ill after eating a different kind of puffer fish, also
known as blowfish.

[Saxitoxin is one of many of the marine toxins associated with what is
commonly known as Paralytic Shellfish poisoning. Saxitoxin is a sodium
channel blocker, and it is possible that these fish died from the
neurotoxic effects of saxitoxin.
Although a previous fish die-off in Florida was reported in ProMED several
months ago ([Fish die-off - USA (Florida) 20021010.5509) there is no
indication that the etiology of the puffer fish die-off is related to that
event. - Mod.TG]
