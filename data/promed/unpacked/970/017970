South Korea confirmed 4 more cases of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) Friday [19 Dec 2014], further indicating the animal disease may be spreading widely.

The 4 additional cases brought to 13 the total number of FMD cases confirmed since the 1st reported outbreak at a pig farm in Jincheon, North Chungcheong Province, on 3 Dec 2014, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs.

The new cases were confirmed at 3 pig farms in Cheongju, Eumseong and Jincheon, all in North Chungcheong Province, and a pig farm in Cheonan, South Chungcheong Province. Since the 1st confirmed case, 14 491 animals have been destroyed.

FMD is a viral disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals, such as cows, sheep and deer.

The ministry on Thursday [18 Dec 2014] raised the country's alert against FMD to the 2nd-highest level, which allows the government to slaughter all animals at an infected farm. The government regulation on FMD only requires infected animals or those showing symptoms be destroyed as a precaution.

[South Korea submitted its follow-up report No 1 to the OIE on Thu 18 Dec 2014, notifying 2 new outbreaks on swine farms, including 5662 susceptible animals, of which 457 were clinically affected. No deaths were reported; only the affected animals were reportedly destroyed.

According to the report, vaccination in response to the outbreak is being applied, 354 000 and 325 000 swine already vaccinated in the provinces Chungcheongbuk-Do and Gyeonggi-Do, respectively.

The report, including an interactive map, is available at
http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=16777.

In view of the significant efforts applied by South Korea to prevent the recurrence of FMD following the major (serotype O) epizootic of 2010/2011, including the application of mass, countrywide preventive vaccinations covering all susceptible species, the current development is indeed disturbing. Stamping out policy seems to be in place.

An update on the current FMD situation in North Korea, where FMD was recorded earlier this year [2014], is anticipated.

Information from South Korea on the vaccination history of the affected pig holdings, and on the genotyping results of the current field strain of the virus (compared to the vaccine strain in use), will be welcomed. - Mod.AS
