Panama disease continues to hit banana farms in Davao
-----------------------------------------------------
The Panama disease has continued to spread in banana plantations in the Davao Region [Mindanao] despite the actions of the national government in addressing the infestation, the Department of Agriculture [DA] revealed.

Norlito P Agduyeng, (DA)-XI, said that flooding has caused the continued spreading of the disease in the banana farms in Davao del Norte. "The problem is that the disease is soil-borne. It easily spreads in areas when there is flooding," he said.

The department is currently getting information on how widespread the disease was as its initial records showed that the disease already infested 586 000 mats [clusters of plants from one root system] of small banana growers in the region.

In November 2011, the DA allocated PHP 30 million [about USD 700 000] to control the spread of the disease that affected 635 hectares [1570 acres] of banana plantations in the region. Part of the money is set aside to produce a kit on how to control the spread of the disease, also known as fusarium wilt. The kit includes the need to properly disinfect the farm tools. "The small banana growers are currently doing the cut-and-burn (activities) to address the problem," the DA said.

The Davao del Norte government also created Banana Fusarium Wilt Task Force to enforce strict quarantine measures for export quality bananas that require banana growers to comply with quarantine protocols.

[Panama disease of banana (PD, also called fungal or fusarium wilt) is caused by the soilborne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _cubense_. Symptoms include yellowing, wilting, and streaking of pseudostem, and affected plants die rapidly. The pathogen is spread by infected planting material, mechanical means (including people and insect activities), soil, and water. It can survive in the soil for decades, and consequently crop rotation with non-hosts is not likely to control the disease effectively.

Disease management for PD is difficult and mostly relies on phytosanitation for pathogen exclusion. No effective chemical or cultural control measures are available, and integrated approaches have been developed (ProMED-mail post 20090419.1483) which may include cultural practices, certified clean planting material, and biocontrol agents. Breeding programmes and molecular techniques are being used to develop crop cultivars with increased resistance to the different fungal strains. Constant vigilance is required in areas where the fungus is present to prevent flare-ups and recognise emerging new strains.

Several races of the pathogen exist varying in host range. Cavendish varieties (see links below), which include most of the bananas grown in Mindanao and affected by the recent outbreak, are attacked by temperate and tropical races 4, as well as a new strain of race 1 reported recently from India (ProMED-mail post 20101223.4510). It is not clear which race(s) or strain(s) is/are causing the present outbreak in Mindanao.
