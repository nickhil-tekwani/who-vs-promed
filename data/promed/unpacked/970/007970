EQUINE HERPESVIRUS - NIGERIA (02)

Please note that the disease has yet to be confirmed as equine herpesvirus.
Indications from equine veterinarians from the Faculty of Veterinary
Medicine, University of Ibadan currently investigating the Lagos polo
outbreaks (in conjunction with the National Veterinary Research Institute
NVRI, Vom, Nigeria, which is the principal veterinary research institute in
Nigeria) point rather to African horse sickness as the most likely diagnosis.

[I appreciate Dr Babalobi's caution that this disease in horses has not yet
been confirmed as equine herpesvirus. When there is a confirmation, we hope
that Dr Babalobi will let us know. - Mod.TG]
