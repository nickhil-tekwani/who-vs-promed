NSW [New South Wales] Health is investigating the possible contamination source after 3 people have now been confirmed with Legionnaires' disease after spending time in Castle Hill. All 3 cases developed the type of Legionnaires' disease caused by _Legionella pneumophila_ bacteria, a bacterial infection of the lungs, which can develop after a person breathes in contaminated water droplets. Legionnaires' disease cannot be spread person to person.

In a statement, NSW Health said The Hills Shire Council and public health units have commenced precautionary inspections of cooling towers in Castle Hill, as outbreaks can be associated with contaminated air conditioning systems in large buildings.

All 3 men who have been diagnosed have each spent time in the Castle Hill area during the period they contracted the infection. All patients reported becoming unwell between [3 and 5 Feb 2018].

In 2016 and 2017 there were 93 and 81 cases of _Legionella pneumophila_ infection notified to NSW Health.

[Humans acquire these organisms after exposure to natural or man-made aquatic reservoirs, usually by means of inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella_, but the disease can also be acquired by aspiration of contaminated potable water in people prone to aspirate, such as debilitated hospitalized patients, or less commonly by inoculation of wounds. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described (Correia AM, Gon√ßalves J, Gomes, JP, et al: Probable person-to-person transmission of legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374(5): 497-8; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356).

Genotyping the strains isolated from the 3 patients will help establish a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no isolates for genotyping.
