Oseltamivir Resistance - Important Clarification
-----------------------------------------------
The case of partial Tamiflu-resistance reported in the
Kawaoka report in Nature [see: Influenza viruses, drug
resistance (05) 20051015.3014] is the same case as was
reported on in the WHO's Manila report in mid-May 2005 [see:
Influenza viruses, drug resistance (03) 20051007.2924;
Influenza viruses, drug resistance (02): RFI 20051001.2878].
I had been told it was a case that hadn't previously been
reported, and I reported it that way. A number of other news
reports treated it as brand new evidence as well. But Dr
Kawaoka confirmed for me today that the virus he calls
A/VN/30408 is the same as A/VN/HN30408 from the earlier
report.

Attention UK health practitioners
---------------------------------
re: ProMED-mail post: Influenza viruses, drug resistance
(05) 20051015.3014: In the light of the Nature article, it
might be useful if ProMED-mail could draw the attention of
UK health practitioners to the National Institute of
Clinical Excellence's (NICE) current consultation on the
status of zanamivir and oseltamivir. The closing date is 24
Oct 2005, and details can be found at
<http://www.nice.org.uk/page.aspx?o=275350>.
