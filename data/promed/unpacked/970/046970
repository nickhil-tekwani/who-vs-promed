State officials have launched their first-ever testing program to determine
whether Indiana's deer herd is infected with chronic wasting disease (CWD),
a Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE). The British "mad-cow"
disease or Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) is a related type of
disease. CWD appears to be spreading throughout the Midwest.
Officials from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (DNR) said at
least 1,100 deer killed by hunters around the state this fall will be
tested, with about 2,000 others preserved for future testing, if necessary.
The widespread testing -- estimated to cost up to $300,000 -- is likely to
show whether the fatal, incurable disease has spread to Indiana, officials
said.
CWD, is related to "mad cow" disease and potentially to variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD), which affects humans. The nervous system
diseases are noted for brain lesions. There is no evidence that CWD can
affect or transmit to humans. There is fear a lot of speculation
surrounding the possibilities, and desire to be proactive regarding the
disease.
Officials say there have been no confirmed cases of CWD being spread to
humans, and the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC)does not consider it a public health risk, according to a spokeswoman.
A hunter and hunting-education instructor, said he won't change any of his
habits because of concerns about the disease, and he hasn't heard much from
other hunters about it, either. [This individual], who lives near North
Vernon, said he hasn't seen any sickly deer recently. "I've seen a lot of
very healthy-looking deer," he said. "If I see a bone-thin deer, I'm not
going to harvest it."
The disease has been spreading through captive and wild populations since
it was discovered in Colorado 35 years ago. It was found earlier this year
in wild deer in southeastern Wisconsin and has been detected in Minnesota,
South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma.
Little is known about how the disease spreads. But many researchers believe
it has moved more quickly around the country because deer- and elk-farming
operations have inadvertently transported the illness across state lines.
Indiana has a one-year ban on importing such animals.
Although researchers are working on a live test for CWD in deer, animals
currently must be killed and their brains checked to determine whether they
are afflicted.
Wisconsin officials have undertaken a massive deer kill and testing
program, hoping to check 50,000 deer for the disease. In some areas,
hunters are being asked to kill every deer they can.
"If you talk to anyone in Wisconsin, you would find that the public is very
aware and very concerned that this has spread in the wild," said John
Goss, director of the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
Since the tests involve examining deer brains, officials ask Indiana
hunters to allow removal of the head from their game when they take it to a
check station. The test is voluntary, but DNR officials say they have had
no problems with hunters turning them down.
More than 150 samples have been collected thus far in the early part of the
hunting season, which lasts in various forms until Jan. 5. Hunters may keep
the antlers and skull caps and will be notified if their deer tests positive.
The testing will be funded in part by about $110,000 in revenue from
hunting licenses. The rest of the money -- up to almost $200,000 -- will
come from other state and federal sources.
If CWD is found in Indiana, more samples will be tested to define how far
it has spread.
One potential impact could be a drop in the number of deer hunters due to
concerns over the disease. In Wisconsin, purchases of deer hunting licenses
have dropped more than 20 percent.
About 100,000 deer are killed each year by Hoosier hunters, with officials
relying on them to manage the deer population. Fewer hunters could mean the
herd size would grow rapidly, resulting in crop damage or a rise in
car-deer accidents.
CWD was first discovered in Colorado deer 35 years ago and has spread to
several Midwestern states, including southeastern Wisconsin.
Hunters should avoiding contact or consumption of deer eyes, brain, spinal
cord, spleen, tonsils or lymph nodes. They should not consume any part of a
deer that appears sick.

[Indiana is being proactive and examining the heads of hunter-killed
animals. As the hunting season opens in many states we are likely to see
more and more of the surveillance for chronic wasting disease utilizing
hunter-killed animals. As these states utilize these programs, there is
always the issue of what plans are in place when the surveillance reveals
the disease? Likewise, without surveillance, we would not know if a disease
exists within an area.
Of equal importance in utilizing hunter-killed animals as part of the
surveillance is the animal the hunter selects. Hunters do not often pay the
license fee in order to kill a sickly animal. Consequently, it becomes
possible that by killing off the trophy animals, the evidence of sick
animals is then noticed.
Although the scientific evidence available about this disease is still very
limited, there is a prions have been identified in the urine of animals
(see ProMEDmail posting CJD (new var.), prospect of urine diagnostic test
20010703.1273). As an aside, one must wonder about the observed habits of
wild animals often using urine as territorial markers, and given this, if
the urine of an infected animal may be one mechanism of spread of this
disease. Ultimately, with increased surveillance for the disease, the
disease is likely to be found. Even with the increased identification of
the disease, we are still left with our current lack of knowledge about the
disease, and lack of dollars for research on the disease. - Mod.TG]
