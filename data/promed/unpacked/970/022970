US military actions on mosquitoes after hurricane Katrina, New Orleans
----------------------------
I served as the US military coordinator for public health and force
protection for the combined National Guard task force performing
rescue and relief operations in the 13 most heavily affected parishes
from 5-15 Sep 2005. Our major logistics hub was being built up at NAS
New Orleans, across the river in Belle Chasse, Plaquemines Parish.
All 14 000-plus Guardsmen being tasked to go out into the parishes to
provide SAR, security, and infrastructure rebuilding passed through
Belle Chasse on their way to the Area of Operations (AO). The base
also became home to over 4000 military personnel involved with the
logistics, command and control and support functions.
Early on one was struck by the eerie silence and absence of birds as
well as seemingly few adult mosquitoes. Since the parish-based vector
control systems were not functioning yet, and the civilian contractor
responsible for vector control on base had evacuated, we needed to
rapidly assess and control the situation.
US Navy SeaBees came in to remove debris and eliminate as much
standing water as possible. In addition, Navy and Air National Guard
military public health technicians examined undrainable collections
of standing water for mosquito larvae and pupae and found none.
Light-traps placed around the base early on showed relatively low
numbers of adult mosquitoes, but as many as 9 different species were
present in one trap.
Louisiana DHH working with an entomology consultant from CDC
coordinated with us and prioritized aerial spraying of the most
heavily affected parishes, which began last weekend and is continuing.
