Veterinary science division monthly reports - Cage/aviary birds
---------------------------------------------------
January 2003
Investigations are continuing to establish the cause of deaths of
adult budgerigars in a number of breeding collections. Post mortem
findings included lung congestion and liver enlargement. Tests for
chlamydiosis were negative, but histopathological examination of the
livers of birds from 2 sites showed intranuclear inclusions in
hepatocytes suggestive of a polyomavirus infection. Avian
polyomavirus is a recognised pathogen of young budgerigars, and its
significance in these deaths in adults is uncertain.
February 2003
Following on from the surveillance report for January, deaths in
adult budgerigars on 2 more sites were reported in February. On one
of the sites approximately 40 out of 80 adult birds died over a
3-month period. Post mortem examination of one bird from this site
revealed an enlarged liver with multiple pale foci, a greatly
enlarged spleen, serositis and pale kidneys. A second bird had an
enlarged liver with a few pale foci and an enlarged spleen, also with
pale foci. A third bird had a slightly enlarged liver and a greatly
enlarged spleen with surface serositis. Evidence of megabacterial
overgrowth was also apparent in some of the birds. Similar to some of
the birds described in the January report, histopathological
examination showed a multifocal necrotic hepatitis, and small numbers
of faintly basophilic glassy intranuclear inclusion bodies were noted
in hepatocytes and kidney tubular epithelial cells. Modified
Ziehl-Neelsen stained smears for chlamydophila were negative, as were
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for avian polyomavirus and
psittacine beak and feather disease virus. Investigations are
continuing.

[The Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) supports the development of
land-based industries and communities through its specialist research
and development resources, its education and training provision, and
its expert advisory and consultancy services. These include 8
veterinary centres. SAC's veterinary science division publishes a
monthly report available on the net. We are posting, several months
after their initial publication, 2 short communications -- derived,
respectively, from the January and February reports-- since they seem
to have been the very first published observations on the current
disease in UK budgerigars, which so far remains undiagnosed.
Hopefully, dissemination of all data from available observations
might be helpful to clinicians and diagnostic laboratories elsewhere
in identifying similar symptoms and/or pathological changes in
budgerigars and other psittacines.
Deaths in budgerigars associated with a paramyxovirus-like agent were
reported in a letter to The Veterinary Record in 1993, describing the
first isolation and identification of the so-called Kunitachi virus
outside Japan and Australia (see Gough et al., 1993, Veterinary
Record , 31 July 1993, Vol 133 (5),p 123). The clinical signs
consisted mainly of vomiting and diarrhoea, conforming, in broad
lines, with the clinical signs observed during the current outbreaks
(diarrhoea and severe weight loss). The PM lesions were fouling
around the beak and vent, and haemorrhagic enteritis. For the
description of gross and histopathological PM findings observed
during the current outbreaks, see SAC's report in this posting and
Ian Brown's report included in our previous posting of 27 Jun 2003
20030627.1584.
The Kunitachi virus was initially reported by Nerome et al., 1978, in
J.Gen. Virol. 38, 293 - 301. The outbreak in Japan resulted in very
high mortalities. - Mod.AS]
