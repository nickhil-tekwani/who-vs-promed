U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman is correct that, at this point, we
can not extrapolate from data gathered in five FoodNet sites to the nation.
What's more, it is not clear to me that data from a handful of sites can be
generalized to the country next year or at any time.
Not only does the distribution of pathogens vary geographically, but
surveillance and the capacity for investigating and confirming foodborne
disease outbreaks varies across state and local health departments.
Furthermore, it is likely that most cases and outbreaks of foodborne
illness are caused by gastrointestinal viruses, probably spread by infected
food workers. The surveillance system for reporting cases of foodborne
disease emphasizes bacterial pathogens and does not include
gastrointestinal viruses. And even the outbreak reporting system is
unlikely to capture outbreaks of viral etiology despite recent developments
in laboratory detection. This has significant implications if surveillance
data are used to inform public health policy decisions. Limiting the
transmission of bacterial pathogens from farm animals to table is
important, but should not overshadow viral pathogens and the role of
infected food workers in transmitting disease.
FoodNet activities will help to improve foodborne disease surveillance in
the United States and better define risk factors for foodborne illness
caused by bacterial pathogens. However, as we begin to analyse these data,
we should be conservative in drawing a national picture of foodborne
illness from them.

>>According to a report released Friday based on data collected by the
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and cited here, the estimated rate of
food-borne disease fell slightly last year to about 50 cases for every
100,000 Americans, but government scientists are still far from certain how
many people get sick from bad food.<<
A comment is surely in order here. This rate is one clinical case per
person every 20 years. This is impressively low considering that around
1,000 meals are consumed per person annually.
The quoted death rate of 9000 people (presumably in the US with a
population of about 250M) is 4 per 100,000. A mortality [CFR of nearly 10%
seems to me to be very high (and rather puzzling) and presumably is being
examined rather more closely. I wonder how many of these stem from
immunosuppressed people or 'public' functions where relatively large
numbers are affected from one source.

I have my doubts about the reliability of the estimates stated. Most
foodborne illness are self limiting and do not get reported to any
surveillance system. Further, in many cases, medical attention is not
sought due to the self-limited nature of the illnesses.
What we had was a discussion of reported outbreaks not all foodborne
illness in the U.S. and thus no more than a gross under-estimate with
limited validity. Am I missing something here?
