2003/100 Potato spindle tuber pospiviroid found in tomatoes in United Kingdom
The United Kingdom NPPO informed the EPPO Secretariat that an outbreak of
Potato spindle tuber pospiviroid [PSTVd] (EPPO A2 list) was very recently
discovered in a tomato production glasshouse in southeast England.
Investigations are under way to ascertain its extent and the possible
pathway for the introduction of the pathogen. Phytosanitary measures are
also being designed to prevent any further spread of the pest and possibly
eradicate it. More information will be provided in due course.

[This is the first confirmed instance of PSTVd infection in the UK. It had
previously been reported from potato (France) and tomato (Netherlands).
PSTVd can reduce yields by as much as 65 and 50% in potato and tomato,
respectively. Other natural hosts include pepino (_Solanum muricatum_),
avocado (_Persea americana_), and a range of solanaceous crops. Results of
studies on several viroids including PSTVd and the Mexican papita viroid
(MPVd), found in 1982 in symptomlessly infected _Solanum cardiophyllum_ in
Aguascalientes state, suggest that MPVd may be the putative ancestor of
crop viroids. PSTVd was reported in the 1930's to be transmitted by chewing
insects (aphids, grasshoppers, flea beetles, tarnished plant bug, leaf
beetle, and Colorado potato beetle). MPVd, present in symptomlessly
infected solanaceous plants, may have been transferred by such insects to
breeding plots and commercial potato crops.
