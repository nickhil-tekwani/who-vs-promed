Comments on the Evidence for West Nile Virus Exposure of Birds in the Arctic
--------------------------------------------------
In the report published by Dr. Yosef et al. on ProMED-mail [see: West Nile
virus, birds, migratory - Israel 20050203.0377], Dr. Yosef wrote: "We
suggest that future studies not assume blindly that the virus is out of
Africa alone."

In reality, studies should not assume anything, but rather build upon good
scientific data. The report, which suggests that Little Stints (_Calidris
minuta_) are exposed to a high rate of West Nile virus (WNV) exposure in
the arctic is rife with assumptions. It assumes that: (1) Migrating birds
are important intercontinental "vectors" of WNV; (2) Seropositive migrant
hatch-year sandpipers (stints) were exposed on their breeding grounds in
the Arctic; and (3) Mosquitoes are responsible for local virus spread.

All 3 of these assumptions can be debated, and none are well-established
scientific facts. For example, Little Stints probably leave their breeding
sites in July and may be captured in Eilat in August-September. Thus they
migrate several thousand miles over an extended period of time, resting
frequently in wetlands, many of which could be WNV transmission foci. It is
even possible that the Little Stints captured in Eilat had been present for
several weeks in Eilat, where WNV has been reported to be endemic.

Before the scientific community starts assuming that WNV is transmitted in
the arctic (where no _Culex_ mosquitoes are present), better evidence is
needed. The main problem with serological test results from migratory
birds, aside from the difficulties and complexities of flavivirus serology,
is that all such birds have unknown travel histories, and thus the site of
infection is unknown. Also, from the report on ProMED-mail, I cannot even
rule out the possibility that these hatch-year Little Stints have
long-lasting maternal antibody, though this is unlikely.

[ Arctic mosquitoes are notorious pests and can occur in tremendous
numbers. Most are species of _Aedes_ and _Ochlerotatus_. _Culex_
mosquitoes are generally absent from such northern areas but _Culex
torrentium_ , an ornithophagic species, is found north of the arctic
circle in Scandanavia. _Culex. territans_ , which feeds mainly on
reptiles and amphibia, but also possibly on mammals, is found in Alaska and
the North West Territories of Canada. And, there is at least one record of
_Culex. tarsalis_ being found in the North West Territories of Canada near
the MacKenzie valley. So a few _Culex_ mosquitoes are found in the far
northern areas.

It might be worth remembering that West Nile virus has been isolated from a
very great number of mosquito species -- in about 11 genera. And in Russia
the virus has been isolated from both ixodid ticks (_Hyalomma marginatum
marginatum_) and from argasid ticks (_Orithodoros capensis_). - Mod.MS]
