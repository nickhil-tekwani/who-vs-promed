From the 2 holdings, samples were taken and sent to the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) on [ 4 Jan 2021]. The highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N8 strain was confirmed on [6 Jan 2021]. The epidemiological investigation is ongoing. The most likely source of infection is wild birds. The virus isolation and the phylogenetic examination are ongoing.

Control measures
Measures applied: Movement control inside the country; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; traceability; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; stamping out; zoning; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: disinfection

Diagnostic test results
