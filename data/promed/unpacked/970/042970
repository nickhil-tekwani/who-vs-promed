EBOLA, PRIMATES - CONGO REP.: CORRECTION

From: James Holland Jones <jhj1@stanford.edu>

The editorial insertion of "Democratic" before Republic of Congo in
the recent ebola posting is incorrect. Lossi Sanctuary is in the
Republic of Congo (a.k.a, Congo Brazzaville) not the Democratic
Republic of Congo (a.k.a., Congo Kinshasa).
