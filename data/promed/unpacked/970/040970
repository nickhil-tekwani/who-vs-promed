Adverse effects from JE vaccine in adults in Taiwan: It would be
interesting to know which JE vaccine is being used in Taiwan and how often
they have seen shock and other severe adverse reactions from it in adults.
We have been using the Biken product at the Thai Red Cross immunization
clinic for many years and have noted virtually no adverse reactions in
adults. Could the author of this report tell us more about this matter
please?

[Indeed. From messages sent by Henry and posted on ProMED-mail, it would
seem the JE vaccines in common use are safe and effective. Adverse
reactions to JE vaccine are no excuse for not vaccinating against this
preventable disease. - Mod.CHC
