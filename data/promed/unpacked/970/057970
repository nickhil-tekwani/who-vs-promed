[1] Alert in 7 states
Date: Thu 23 Jul 2020

Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a reportable animal disease, has been found in 7 states in 2020: Arizona, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas [now also in Arkansas; see [4] below]. As VSV may spread throughout the Midwest and mountain states, livestock owners, especially those with horses, should be looking for signs.

VSV is a viral disease primarily affecting horses, also cattle, and occasionally swine, sheep, goats, llamas, and alpacas. Although humans can become infected with the disease when handling affected animals, resulting in flu-like symptoms, this is a rare event. The main signs of VSV are slobbering, blisters, sores, and sloughing of skin in the mouth, on the tongue, on the muzzle, inside the ears, and on the coronary band above the hooves. Lameness and weight loss may also occur.

Flies and midges are the main vectors for VSV. The virus is also spread through direct contact with infected livestock and indirectly through contact with contaminated equipment and tack. Fly control, including eliminating fly breeding and hiding habitat, is the most important step in preventing the disease. Good sanitation and bio-security measures can help avoid exposure.

Wyoming's previous recent outbreaks of VSV were in 2005, 2006, 2015, and 2019. Nearly all of the affected livestock during those outbreak years were pastured along drainages or had a very recent history of exposure to low-lying, riparian areas. We advise livestock owners, if possible, to move their healthy animals to higher, dryer ground until the VSV insect vector season subsides. That is generally after 2 hard frosts.

VSV is particularly significant because it is clinically indistinguishable from foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), swine vesicular disease, and vesicular exanthema of swine, all serious foreign animal diseases (FAD). Because of similarities to these FADs, it is essential to quickly confirm a diagnosis with laboratory testing. Of the vesicular diseases, VSV is the only one that affects horses, and the presence of lesions is suggestive of VSV.

According to State Veterinarian, Dr Jim Logan, "during years when VSV appears in states south of Wyoming in the spring and early summer, we can expect to see it here, too. Typically we see our 1st cases in July, so we're hopeful it will stay south of us, but we must be vigilant and diligently monitor our livestock, especially those having been hauled to events in affected states."

If you suspect VSV in your animals, contact your veterinarian immediately. Vesicular stomatitis virus is a reportable disease that should be immediately reported to the Wyoming State Veterinarian at 307-857-4140 or to the USDA APHIS Veterinary Services' Wyoming Office at 307-432-7960.

For further information regarding this press release, please contact the Wyoming State Veterinarian at 307-857-4140.

[2] Kansas: cattle, horses

Vesicular stomatitis continues to spread, now in 22 Kansas counties; 90 premises are in quarantine.

Over 20 counties now have cases, including Lyon, Chase, Coffey, Greenwood, and Morris counties in the KVOE listening area. Nearly 90 so-called premises are currently in quarantine. Lyon County currently has 3 confirmed premises and 2 either suspect or pending premises. Area stats are online at KVOE.com [see source URL above].

The Kansas Department of Agriculture [KDA] says most of the cases are in horses, but some cattle have been affected. KDA encourages cattle ranchers to watch their herds for signs, which can include lesions on the muzzle, lips, ears, coronary bands, or ventral abdomen. Infected animals can also have fevers and other blister-like lesions on the mouth, dental pad, tongue, lips, nostrils, ears, and hooves.

It can take 5 to 7 days for the virus to subside, however, it can take an additional week for the affected animal to fully recover. VSV is transmitted by biting insects such as black flies, sand flies, and midges.

For more information, call the Department of Agriculture's Division of Animal Health or go online to http://www.agriculture.ks.gov/VSV.

[3] Missouri: cattle and horses

Currently 23 premises in [Missouri] are quarantined due to vesicular stomatitis.

In its [23 Jul 2020] situation report, the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirmed Cedar County as being newly infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). This marks Missouri's fourth affected county.

In its [20 Jul 2020] situation report, APHIS confirmed newly infected premises in Jasper and Lawrence counties, in addition to Newton, the state's 1st affected county, which was confirmed with a positive equine case on 13 Jul 2020.

Missouri contains quarantined premises as follows:
- Cedar (1 confirmed positive equine/cattle premises)
- Jasper (7 confirmed positive and 5 suspect equine premises)
- Lawrence (1 confirmed positive equine premises)
- Newton (5 confirmed positive and 4 suspect equine premises)

Premises with confirmed positive and suspect cases are quarantined and monitored by veterinarians for at least 14 days from the onset of lesions in the last animal affected.

Vesicular stomatitis virus can cause blisters and sores in the mouth and on the tongue, muzzle, teats, or hooves of horses, cattle, swine, sheep, goats, llamas, and a number of other animals. Lesions usually heal in 2 or 3 weeks.

Because of the virus' contagious nature and its resemblance to other diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease, animal health officials urge livestock owners and caretakers to report these symptoms to their veterinarian immediately. Most animals recover with supportive care by a veterinarian.

"Vesicular stomatitis has been conÔ¨Årmed only in the western hemisphere," APHIS said on its website. "It is known to be an endemic disease in the warmer regions of North, Central, and South America, and outbreaks of the disease in other temperate geographic parts of the hemisphere occur sporadically. The Southwestern and Western United States have experienced a number of vesicular stomatitis outbreaks ... Outbreaks usually occur during the warmer months, often along waterways." According to Angela Pelzel McCluskey, DVM, APHIS' equine epidemiologist, the largest VS outbreak in more than 40 years of recorded history occurred in 2019.

Some states and other countries might restrict movement of, or impose additional requirements for, susceptible animals from states having known VS cases. Before moving livestock, contact the state of destination for its requirements.

[4] Arkansas: 4 animals

Four animals in Benton County have caught an extremely contagious virus having the potential to spread to humans. It's called vesicular stomatitis or VSV.

It is most common in horses, donkeys, and mules but can also spread to cattle, hogs, and even humans. [Yet this article does not tell us which animal is affected. - Mod.TG]

VSV causes blisters and open sores around the mouth and then the animals will get malnourished because they won't want to eat.

A local veterinarian talks about the risk of this spreading:
"This disease can spread like wildfire if we don't help control the flies and isolation," Country Vet Owner Dr Tim O'Neill said.

O'Neill said although the infection rate is extremely high, the death rate is typically very low.

More information on vesicular stomatitis can be found on the Arkansas Department of Agriculture website at https://tinyurl.com/y3z2a4xb.

The state released information about animal movement restrictions in the state saying livestock movement "may change daily due to emerging disease detection in various counties."

"No hoofed animal may leave the premise of origin if pastured, housed, or has indirect/direct contact during the previous 30 days to an enclosure or premises currently quarantined for vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)."

Vesicular stomatitis restrictions require all Arkansas based equine (horses, donkeys, mules, etc.) [why did Arkansas not place such restrictions on cattle and other animals when this disease affects them as well? - Mod.TG] originating from a premises within the county or adjacent county of any VSV quarantined facility to be:
- examined by a Category II / USDA accredited veterinarian; and
- be declared free from signs or lesions of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) within 5 days prior to movement within or travel through Arkansas; and
- be accompanied by a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (CVI) with date of veterinarian's examination recorded. Fill out all blank spaces (add name of county to the CVI).
- Entry permit number should be obtained for the movement to any other location in Arkansas or out-of-state. Record the entry permit number on the CVI.
- The following statement is to be added to the CVI and signed by the attending veterinarian with that veterinarian's USDA accreditation number noted on the CVI (near signature):
"All animals individually identified and noted on this Certificate of Veterinary Inspection have been examined by me and found to be free from signs or lesions of vesicular stomatitis virus infection. The owner of the animals listed has attested to me that these animals have not had direct contact or indirect exposure to any premise quarantined or suspect for presence of vesicular stomatitis within the past 30 days."

VSV is transmitted by biting insects such as black flies, sand flies, and midges. The use of insect spray approved for your horse or cattle may help.

This disease seems to appear every year or every couple of years. There are 2 strains and USDA and other resources have stopped reporting the strain in each state. It is important to track the strains, as some states may have more than one. There is no vaccine for this disease and while it causes our animals pain and can stop our transport to shows or events, the lesions heal in 2-3 weeks. Vigilance is required to notice when your animal(s) has/have quit eating, as blisters in the mouth can be painful. In most states, this is a reportable disease and should be reported to the state veterinarian's office of the affected state. - Mod.TG]
