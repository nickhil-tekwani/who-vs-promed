One day after the confirmation of the presence of HPAIV (highly pathogenic
avian influenza virus) H5N1 in 5 dead mute swans (_Cygnus olor_) and one
Canada goose (_Branta canadensis_) at 2 lakes within the city of Nuremberg
in Germany, 3 further mute swans were found dead this morning [26 Jun 2007]
at a small lake about 180 km (about 112 mi) north of Nuremberg in
Frohburg/Saxony. Investigations at the regional laboratory in Leipzig
yielded an initial suspicion, which was confirmed by the National and OIE
(World Organization for Animal Health) reference laboratory for Avian
Influenza at the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut this afternoon. Real-time
RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) specific for HPAIV
of Qinghai-like strains (Hoffmann et al, 2007) proved that the viruses
present in the Saxonian swans are highly pathogenic H5N1. Sequence analyses
are ongoing.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) subtype H5N1 re-emerged in
wild aquatic birds in southern Germany. The virus was detected on Fri 22
Jun 2007, in 5 mute swans (_Cygnus olor_) and one Canada goose (_Branta
canadensis_) found dead at 2 lakes located in the inner city of Nuremberg.
Initial results obtained by the regional laboratory (Landesamt fur
Gesundheit und Lebensmittelsicherheit, Erlangen) have been confirmed and
extended by the OIE (Office International des Epizooties; World
Organization for Animal Health) and National Reference Laboratory for Avian
Influenza at the Friedrich-Loeffler Institut, Isle of Riems. A real-time
RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) specific for H5
strains of the "Qinghai" lineage yielded positive results. This virus
lineage had caused the epidemic among wild birds in Europe in 2006 and had
also been responsible for the outbreaks in Hungary and the UK in 2007.
Thus, a close relationship to this lineage is anticipated for the viruses
from Nuremberg.
Further sequence analysis is in progress. Results will allow a thorough
comparison also to the H5N1 HPAI virus causing an outbreak in a turkey
holding in the Czech Republic last week [18-24 Jun 2007]. Nuremberg is
situated 375 km (233 mi) west of the site of the Czech outbreak.
The last H5N1 case in Germany had been detected in a black swan (_Cygnus
atratus_) in the Dresden zoo, in south eastern Germany, in August 2006. The
examination of more than 16 000 wild birds comprising a total of 186
species since autumn 2006 had not yielded any H5N1 HPAI positive results.
In 2007, a total of 1347 mute swans, 335 of which were found dead, had
tested negative for H5N1. Nevertheless, it cannot be excluded that the
virus has been continuously present at low prevalence and/or in clustered
pockets of the wild bird population. This had been addressed in the risk
assessment of the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut of April 2007, in which the
overall risk of an introduction of H5N1 HPAIV was characterized as "moderate".
Ongoing regional monitoring activities among the wild bird population will
be intensified to check whether further pockets of H5N1 HPAIV infection are
present in this region. In addition, enhanced biosecurity measures are to
be implemented in poultry holdings.

[The receipt of the these 2 reports from the Friedrich Loeffler Institute
(FLI), initially submitted, respectively, on 25 and 26 Jun 2007, has been
delayed for technical reasons. We are grateful to Prof Mettenleiter and his
colleagues for their firsthand and authoritative information. We also thank
Thomas Roesel for kindly translating a press release from FLI, dated 26 Jun
2007 (the original is available at
<http://www.fli.bund.de/253.html?&no_cache=1&tx_ttnews[tt_news]=406&cHash=11da06ab88>).
The text he submitted has been replaced by the institute's report above.
Results of the molecular studies and phylogenetic analysis of the current
German isolates, undertaken by the FLI OIE reference laboratory, as well as
those addressing the recent isolate from the Czech Republic, undertaken by
another OIE reference laboratory, VRL, Weybridge, UK, are anticipated with
interest. - Mod.AS
