Diarrhea outbreak kills 67
--------------------------
An outbreak of diarrhea in India's most populous state has killed at least
67 people, mostly children, in the past 10 days, a government health
official said on Wed 13 Aug 2003.
Deaths from waterborne diseases during the rainy season are common in Uttar
Pradesh, an impoverished state with poor water, power and health
facilities. An outbreak of diarrhea has been reported in 11 districts and
more than 250 people have been admitted to hospitals statewide, said RB
Singh, the officer in charge of epidemic control. At least 67 people have
died since 4 Aug 2003, he said, most of them children.
Local news reports say the death toll is much higher than the official
figure. Worst affected has been the district of Ballia, 320 kilometers east
of Lucknow, the state capital, where at least 19 children have died in the
past 5 days, said Dr SR Yadav, the district's chief medical officer. 6
children died of diarrhea last week in Lucknow, where sewage entered a
pipeline carrying drinking water to the Jankipuram neighborhood. "We were
getting brownish colored water. Complaints were lodged ... but nothing
happened," said a resident of Jankipuram said. "The government woke up only
after children started dying." Another Jankipuram resident said he was
forced to take his 3 year old son to a government hospital as private
clinics were overcrowded with patients. "He died before doctors could
attend to him," the man said with tears in his eyes.
Uttar Pradesh Health Minister Aridaman Singh said the government is keeping
a close watch on the situation. Health workers have been asked to
chlorinate water sources in villages and small towns across the state, he
said. Nearly 70 per cent of the state's 165 million people lack access to
safe drinking water. Rains cause water-logging in areas lacking proper
drainage systems and contaminate water in ponds and wells used by villagers
for drinking. More than 200 people died of diarrhea, cholera and malaria in
the state during the last monsoon season.

Cholera in Liberia - Update 2: 13 Aug 2003
----------------------------------------------
A WHO team composed of 3 experts, an epidemiologist, an expert on cholera
from the Cholera Task Force, and a water and sanitation engineer are en
route to Liberia to support the WHO country office in the surveillance and
control of communicable diseases (see Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update
2003 (10) 20030812.1992). The mission is a joint response, carried out in
collaboration with the WHO Regional Office for Africa. A major concern is
the ongoing outbreak of cholera in Monrovia which to date has led to 1 944
cases and 17 deaths.
The team will:
assess the overall health situation in Monrovia and other areas as relevant;
assess control and response measures in place for cholera and diarrheal
diseases, current water supply and sanitation systems;
develop a health surveillance system for the emergency phase including an
early warning system for outbreaks;
strengthen information reporting and assess laboratory capacity for the
confirmation of main communicable diseases;
identify mechanisms for collection and transport of specimen samples;
develop a plan for epidemic preparedness and response for the main
epidemic-prone diseases with key partners; and
collaborate with relevant agencies in providing safe water.
The team will work with the WHO country office, national health authorities
on the ground and key partners including other United Nations agencies,
Medecins sans Frontieres and the International Committee of the Red Cross.
WHO has supplied laboratory equipment for specimen sampling for use during
this mission.

[5] Central Africa Republic (Diarrhea)

A joint medical team of government and NGO officials is in the northern
town of Bocaranga, Central African Republic, to investigate cases of a
diarrheal disease detected by local health services in early July, an
official of Medicos Sin Fronteras (MSF-Spain) told IRIN on Mon, 12 Aug 2003.
The official, who requested anonymity, said the team was made up of a
Ministry of Health epidemiologist, a laboratory assistant of the Pasteur
Institute and 2 MSF nurses. He said a medical doctor working in the
Bocaranga hospital, supported by Italian NGO Cooperazione Internazionale,
raised the alarm on Fri, 8 Aug 2003.
"After he alerted us we immediately decided to send, on the ground, a joint
mission to identify the disease and make laboratory tests," the MSF
official said. He said that 15 of the 400 people who had reported to local
health facilities with bloody diarrhea since July had died. But, he said,
"Treatment against that disease seems to be efficient."
The Pasteur Institute is carrying out laboratory field tests to determine
the source and type of diarrhea that struck Bocaranga, 510 north west of
Bangui, and surrounding villages. The European Community Humanitarian
Office and the European Development Fund disbursed 1.78 million euro (USD
2.1 million) in May to rehabilitate the health system in the war-affected
regions of the north, among them Bocaranga.
Bocaranga, a town of some 15 000 people, is in an area that was badly
affected by the fighting between government and rebel troops from Oct 2002
to Mar 2003. It is the only town in the north and north west of the country
with a medical doctor. Others who fled the fighting have still not
returned. Humanitarian NGOs have been calling on the government to send
qualified medical personnel to the north, where nurses are reportedly
running hospitals. The outbreak of diarrhea was reported just days after
the International Committee of Red Cross announced a USD 2.2 million water
programme for towns facing shortages of clean water.
[Also here, at least some of these cases, in the outbreak that may well be
multifactorial, are likely to be cholera. - Mod.LL]

Outbreak of Salmonella Typhimurium DT 108 (or DT 170) due to imported
contaminated kebab meat in Sweden
-----------------------------------------------------
On 17 Jul 2003, local health authorities in the county of Blekinge in
southern Sweden informed the Epidemiology Branch of the Swedish Institute
for Infectious Disease Control (Smittskyddsinstitutet, SMI) that 4 people
had been infected by salmonellosis after eating kebabs at a local pizzeria
the previous week. The following day, environmental health officers from
the municipality visited the restaurant to take food and environmental
samples from the premises. The restaurant was closed pending further
investigation.
The meat used for kebab production was delivered from a wholesaler in
Jönköping who had imported frozen pork collar originating from a
slaughterhouse in Denmark and distributed it to a number of restaurants in
a total of 27 Swedish municipalities. The Danish slaughterhouse plant
claimed that the suspected consignment was _Salmonella sp._ free when
transported to Sweden. Food and environmental samples were taken at the
premises of the wholesaler. The finding that pork was used for kebabs was
unexpected. The Swedish National Food Administration (Livsmedelsverket,
<http://www.slv.se>) recommended that environmental health officers in the
27 recipient municipalities inspect restaurants that had received meat from
the implicated consignment. Sampling and testing of pork collar and kebab
were performed.
The county medical officer in Blekinge issued a press release asking people
who had eaten at the implicated restaurant in Blekinge during the preceding
weeks, especially food handlers and healthcare workers, to make contact.
During the weekend of 19-20 Jul 2003, a large number of people sought
medical care and 6 persons were admitted to hospital with gastroenteritis.
The total number of cases was estimated to be between 60 and 120. Fecal
samples from a proportion of the cases were investigated for _Salmonella
sp._ in the local laboratories and forwarded to the bacteriology branch of
SMI for confirmation and phage typing.
On 22 Jul, bacteriological analysis showed the strain of the first 2 cases
to be _S. Typhimurium_ DT 108. This is a very uncommon phage type, with
only 1 human case previously diagnosed in Sweden: a girl returning from the
Canary Islands in 1998. However, routine tests had identified this strain
in pork meat from Denmark in Dec 2002. In total 112 cases have been
identified in Blekinge (60 confirmed by laboratory testing, and 52 by
epidemiological linkage) with dates of symptom onset between 4 and 23 July.
Most of the cases occurred in people living in the county, but some cases
were in people from other parts of Sweden who had visited the affected
restaurant. Eight people were admitted to hospital.
Samples from marinated and spiced meat from the implicated consignment, as
well as samples from 4 different municipalities were positive for _S.
Typhimurium_ DT 108. The Swedish National Food Administration informed the
Danish authorities and notified the European Commission through the Rapid
Alert System for Food and Feed
<http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/sfp/ras_week31_en.pdf>.
In early Aug 2003, 4 additional cases of _S. Typhimurium_ DT108 were
confirmed in another small town in southern Sweden. The patients had fallen
ill between 14 and 22 Jul after eating kebab meat at 2 different
restaurants. Another 4 cases were also notified from south west Sweden.
These 4 cases were in patients who had a history of eating kebabs, but not
all of them at restaurants with recorded deliveries from the implicated
consignment. Following this, the National Food Administration recommended
that all 290 municipalities in Sweden should test samples from kebab meat
and/or Danish pork collar to prevent further spread of the disease.
Since DT108 has rarely been isolated in Denmark, the assumption that the
infection came via Danish meat was questionable initally. However, when _S.
Typhimurium DT108_ was isolated from fresh pork collar, it was concluded
that the infection had originated in the Danish meat product. On 4 Aug, 3
human strains and two meat strains were sent from SMI to the Danish
Veterinary Institute (Danmarks Veterinaerinstitut,
<http://www.vetinst.dk/>) for comparison of subtyping results. The Danish
laboratory, which has great experience of Danish pork endemic strains,
found all 5 strains to be _S. Typhimurium_ DT170; however, the differences
in phage typing patterns between DT108 and 170 are minimal, and both
laboratories stress that assignment of the phage type is mostly a matter of
judgement.
This finding changes the situation, since _S. Typhimurium_ DT170 is a
frequently reported strain in Denmark, both in pork and poultry and in
samples from patients. Remarkably, however, it is a salmonella type rarely
seen in Sweden, where the last human case was reported in 1999. The
proposed testing of kebab meat across Sweden could have the additional
benefit of revealing the point prevalence of any type of salmonella in such
products during an unusually hot summer.
