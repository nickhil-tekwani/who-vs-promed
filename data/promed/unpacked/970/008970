Grazing sheep have been blamed for infecting drinking water with a
potentially life-threatening parasite. The contamination infected 308
people last year was probably due to sheep grazing near a North West Water
reservoir in the Lake District, health authorities have said.Steps have
been taken by North West Water to remedy the situation.
During the outbreak a microscopic parasite, cryptosporidium, spread through
the water supply to households in Greater Manchester and Lancashire. An
investigation led by epidemiologist Professor Paul Hunter at the
Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre in Liverpool traced the source of
the infection.
The water was supplied by North West Water from one of its main reservoirs
at Thirlmere in the Lake District during April and May last year.
The infection, whose symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting and headaches, can
be life-threatening although most people will recover within 1 to 4 weeks
said Professor Hunter.
Urgent measures
The company has been recommended to make urgent improvements at key
treatment plants to prevent further outbreak. A spokesman for North West
Water said the company is spending BPS300m to protect the water supplies.
Professor Hunter said: "Steps have been taken by North West Water to remedy
the situation and we must now wait and see if they have worked. Obviously
there is still a great deal of work to be done."
Measures are under way to improve the monitoring system at Thirlmere, and
change grazing procedures for sheep and cattle around the reservoir.
Professor Hunter said those with reduced immunity, such as people with HIV
and AIDS, could be more seriously affected by the water infection.
The region's health authorities have advised such people to boil all
drinking water.

[People can become seriously dehydrated from this parasite. Dehydration in
infants, the elderly and those immunologically compromised can be a life
threatening situation. Cryptosporidium is a very, very tiny parasite
carried by many animals. For crytpsporidum to be filtered from a water
system requires special screens. As people encroach on grazing lands, urban
areas sprawl, more outbreaks of this type are likely to be seen. - Mod.TG
