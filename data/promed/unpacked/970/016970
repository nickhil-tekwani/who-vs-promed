A disease outbreak is killing deer throughout Delaware, wildlife officials say, but the illness borne by tiny flies does not affect humans or livestock.

The carcasses don't transmit the disease, but authorities advise against eating the meat of obviously sickened deer, saying they may have secondary infections that could affect people. Carcasses should be removed from ponds and streams to prevent other contamination, the Division of Fish and Wildlife said in an advisory, but it's safe to otherwise leave them to deteriorate naturally. The disease lasts less than 24 hours after deer die.

So far, a total of 31 deer have died statewide in the outbreak of epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD), transmitted by small biting flies called midges or "no-see-'ems," division officials say. Deaths have been concentrated in Sussex County, outside Georgetown and Milton, but have been reported in all 3 counties.

"We are in a position of allowing nature to run its course and waiting for a hard frost to kill the midges," game mammal biologist Joe Rogerson said in the statement from the division, part of the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control.

The disease is swift and devastating: Deer don't eat, they waste away, over-salivate, may get severely swollen heads and bleed, sometimes profusely, from the head, eyes, tongue, neck and rectum. They suffer high fevers, leading many to seek water and be found sick or dead in or near it. They can lose fear of people and have been known to behave erratically, even bizarrely, before collapsing, becoming unconscious and dying. There is no vaccination or treatment.

Other northern states already are reporting hundreds of deaths from the disease, outbreaks of which are associated with drought and occur in late summer and early fall, DNREC said. "We expect hunters and landowners will report more dead deer in more widespread areas as they venture into the woods for the Sept. 1 start of deer archery season," Rogerson said. But wildlife officials say the current outbreak "has minimal long-range ramifications for the viability of the state's deer herd."

The disease, first identified in 1955, is both the most significant and widely studied disease affecting North America's white-tailed deer, they say. Outbreaks are common in the mid-Atlantic region. Delaware's last significant outbreak was in 2007, with 132 documented deer deaths, division officials say. Two years ago, there was a smaller outbreak of the disease.

"One positive outcome of having periodic outbreaks of EHD, such as those that occurred in 2007 and 2010, is that our deer have a chance to develop antibodies to fight the disease," said Rob Hossler, the division's game species program manager. "Deer having this resistance to EHD helps prevent large-scale losses."

The state agency says no pesticides can be sprayed to kill its carriers. Landowners who prefer not to allow diseased, dead deer to deteriorate naturally may dispose of them at landfills accepting household solid waste, but removal is property owners' responsibility, DNREC said.

State officials ask those who find dead deer that may have the disease and show no other apparent cause of death to call 735-3600 to report the finding.

[EHD is fairly widespread in the USA. These reports are relatively common in the hot summer, especially late summer and fall prior to a frost.

EHD is the most important disease of white-tailed deer. Outbreaks are common in the Southeast of USA, but they are also frequently documented further North. The disease is transmitted by biting midges and its occurrence is seasonal, from late summer to early fall. The die-offs cease with the 1st frosts. The EHD virus does not pose a risk for human or livestock health.

High density deer herds may have higher mortality rates; however, the relationship of deer density to the severity of hemorrhagic disease is not clear-cut, as the virus is not spread by direct contact and depends on the dynamics of the arthropod vector. For more information on the disease see comments on ProMED-mail post 20110918.2842.
