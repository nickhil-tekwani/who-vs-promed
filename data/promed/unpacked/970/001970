The discovery of 6 dolphins found dead or dying along the Orange county coast over the past 14 days has prompted officials to sound the alarm, according to local marine mammal experts. The beached common and bottlenose dolphins, discovered in Huntington Beach, Corona Del Mar, and Laguna Beach, have all perished, according to a [Mon 25 Feb 2019] news release from Laguna Beach-based Pacific Marine Mammal Center [PMMC].

Experts at the center are investigating why these dolphins are stranding (themselves), according to Pacific Marine Mammal Center veterinarian Kristen Sakamaki. Weather, toxins, and infection are all being investigated, they said. "We may not always get a definitive answer, but we consider our research with these dolphins to be a critical piece to the puzzle in providing clues as to what is going on in our nearshore habitats," Sakamaki said. The center's vets have performed necropsies on all the dolphins with assistance from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration mammal diagnostic labs, and research continues, according to Sakamaki.

With Ocean experts alerting residents to stay out of the water following storms, it begs the question if the bacteria-filled water could also be a contributing factor with the sick and dying dolphins. The Southern California Coastal Ocean Observing System reported harmful algae blooms in the area, which produces toxic domoic acid, poisonous upon ingestion to humans, birds, and marine mammals alike, the center said.

Compared to years past, this is a "drastic and unexpected increase" in the number of dolphins found along the shore. According to the Pacific Marine Mammal Center, 2019 has seen a rise in the number of seals, sea lions and now elephant seals brought into their care. Between [4 and 15 Feb 2019], 6 dolphins were found either dead or were euthanized shortly after discovery, the center said. One male cetacean was found dead in Huntington Beach on [4 Feb 2019]. The PMMC rescued 2 other male dolphins in extreme distress from Laguna Beach. Both cetaceans required humane euthanization due to their rapidly deteriorating conditions.

Two pregnant females were found beached onshore in Corona Del Mar, already dead, they said. 2 other dolphins were seen during that time, though officials were unable to reach them, according to the release. Finding animals they are unable to rehabilitate is "heartbreaking," said Peter Chang, CEO of PMMC in Laguna Beach. "These stranding events will provide a tremendous amount of information with the science on the changes we see in the ocean waters."

[Past marine wildlife die-offs in the coast of California have been caused by harmful algal blooms (domoic acid toxicity), underwater detonation exercises, and co-lateral damage caused by fisheries.

We await test results that shed some light on these mortalities. - Mod.PMB
