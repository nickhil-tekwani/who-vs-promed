The number of people sickened with West Nile encephalitis [WNE] in
the Volgograd region has increased to 365. "In the period from 16
Jul-14 Sep [2010], 365 cases were registered, including 295 in
Volgograd (81 percent), 25 in the town of Volzhsky (6.8 percent), and
45 in municipal districts (12.3 percent), the regional department of
the Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for Consumer Affairs and Human
Welfare] said.

Rospotrebnadzor said 5 WNE patients died. "The lethal outcomes were
reported for the group over 60 years of age (80 percent); they were
confirmed in 4 people by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method
in laboratories," it said.

All the WNE patients have been hospitalized; medical assistance is
being provided to them.

Rospotrebnadzor said the number of patients grows by 10-20 people a day.

As of 1 Sep [2010], there were just 206 WNE patients in the province.

According to Rospotrebnadzor officials, the climate of the region and
natural migration of birds of passage that make nests in the estuary
of the Volga, create favourable conditions for the breeding
[transmission] of the virus. As a result, the region hosted stable
WNE nidi, which have intensified since 1999, and remain active up to
date. Mosquitoes are the main carriers.

The death toll of West Nile reached 4 in Romania, while the
infections amount to 38, the Health Ministry said Wednesday [15 Sep
2010]. The latest victim is a 60-year-old woman from the southeastern
county of Constanta, who was suffering from associated chronic
diseases: hypertension and complications from a stroke, the ministry
said in a release. According to the release, 4 new infections have
been confirmed. The authorities confirmed late August [2010] the 1st
2 deaths from West Nile virus in the country. All 4 people who died
from the virus were aged over 60 and had chronic illnesses.

West Nile virus can cause encephalitis and meningitis that could be
fatal for almost a 4 percent of patients. Most people who are
infected suffer from fever or other mild symptoms and quickly
recover, without even rushing to doctors.

Outbreaks of the virus have been reported over the past 15 years
across Europe and are connected with high temperatures.
