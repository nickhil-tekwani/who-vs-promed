A small North County poultry ranch and another in San Bernardino County
were added yesterday to the growing tally of commercial operations infected
with exotic Newcastle disease, the deadly avian virus that has spread
across Southern California. The spread among poultry ranches had appeared
to slow and task force officials were guardedly encouraged, but they said
there was no way of telling when they would gain control over the disease.
"I don't think we can really make any predictions until we aren't making
any findings at all," said Larry Cooper, spokesman for the California
Department of Food and Agriculture. The newly infected ranches bring the
state total to 19, 6 of which are in north San Diego County.
Exotic Newcastle disease is harmless to humans. The state and federal
Exotic Newcastle Disease Task Force would not reveal the ranches' names or
locations. But Cooper said the 4000-bird ranch in this county was close to
others that had been infected. Of the previously infected ranches, 4 were
in Valley Center and one was in Ramona. All birds at the North County ranch
and the 40 000 at the ranch in San Bernardino County will be destroyed.
The task force also added 2 more backyard, or pet, cases to the list, one
in Valley Center and one in Escondido, bringing that total to 12. However,
4 of the cases in Valley Center are considered "dangerous contacts," which
means the birds had not tested positive for exotic Newcastle but were a
risk due to their high level of exposure to an infected site.
The outbreak, first confirmed in backyard birds in the city of Compton in
Los Angeles County in October 2002, has forced authorities to euthanize 3
million birds.
