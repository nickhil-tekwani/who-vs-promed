The death of a 20-year-old student reinforces the suspicions of the existence of spotted fever cases in the region of Pampulha in Belo Horizonte [Minas Gerais state]. The family of the young man reported that he showed symptoms such as high fever and body aches a little more than 10 days after riding a bicycle by the edge of a lake. The Municipal Secretariat of Health (SMS) states that it has not yet been informed of the case and that in the last 4 years only 2 patients were diagnosed with the disease in the city, without any deaths.

The student died on 8 Feb 2014 after spending 5 days in the hospitals of Belo Horizonte and Lifecenter. Doctors initially believed the student had dengue based on his symptoms. According to the student's family, a test performed later by the Fundacao Ezequiel Dias (Funed) confirmed that he had spotted fever [the diagnostic test was not identified - Mod.LL], a disease caused by a bacterium [_Rickettsia rickettsii_] transmitted by the bite of the Cayenne tick [_Amblyomma cajennense_]. The suspicion is that capybara [_Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris_] in the Pampulha region were the reservoir for the tick and the rickettsia.

The family said that they had already been informed of another death in the region in February 2014. "There are no official figures, but a computer technician also died with the same symptoms and the family claims he had been walking in the Pampulha Ecological Park."

[The Rocky Mountain spotted fever rickettsia, _R. rickettsii_, is the cause of this illness, which is also referred to as febre maculosa, Sao Paulo exanthematic typhus, Minas Gerais exanthematic typhus, and Brazilian spotted fever. The organism, which is tickborne, is distributed through much of the USA including the Rocky Mountains and also in parts of southern Canada, Central, and South America.

It cannot be stressed enough that early recognition of this disease is quite important in minimizing morbidity and mortality. This is especially true in areas where the infection is not as classically known. The incubation period of the disease is about a week after the tick exposure, long after the tick has detached. The presenting illness is generally nonspecific, fever, muscle pains, headache (the headache is usually described as quite severe). The rash begins in day 3 of illness, initially maculopapular at the wrists and ankles before becoming petechial and purpuric involving the palms and soles, as well as spreading proximally to the truck. Purpura usually is not seen before the 6th day of illness. The mortality is indeed quite low if treatment (usually a tetracycline) is begun during the 1st 2 days of the rash or before.

Empiric treatment for this infection should always be begun in people with compatible symptoms inhabiting endemic areas during the spring and summer, even if no tick bite is known.

[This report 1st appeared on ProMED-/PORT where Mod. RNA had the following commentary and suggested references:

The history repeats itself once again.
The same scenario: capybaras, ticks and hydric collections. The same flaws: not suspected, not treated. The same questions: how to control the disease?

The news brings up an overview of the complexities regarding the disease and especially its transmission cycle, which makes the Brazilian spotted fever, caused by _Rickettsia rickettsii_ a great challenge as a public health problem in Brazil:
- A disease which, although of low incidence, is associated with high mortality rates;
- A multisystem disease with rapid progression to multiple organ dysfunction, rarely considered a probable diagnosis and often confused with many other diseases (dengue and leptospirosis , for example) . Consequence: Late specific or, worse, cases not investigated and treated appropriately;
- The risk of infection that is no longer restricted to rural, peri-urban and wild areas, but is associated increasingly the transmission in urban areas (public parks, for example) ;
- Increasing risk of infection associated with leisure activities;
- The role of the capybara as an important element in the chain of transmission of the disease where the vector the incriminated is _Amblyomma cajennense_ ;
- The challenge is the management of a sylvatic animal (host) that installs, adapts and thrives in urban spaces .
