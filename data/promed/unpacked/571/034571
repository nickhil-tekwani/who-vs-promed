WHITE-NOSE SYNDROME, BATS - USA (05): (PENNSYLVANIA)

remain unnamed


I noted the comment on [ProMED-mail White-nose syndrome, bats - USA
(04): (PA) 20090306.093] and I feel that I should make some comments,
being a caver myself- originally from Pennsylvania, now Arizona.

There is considerable distress within the caving community that the
pathogen(s) may be spread by cavers; it fits the observed pattern,
although I confess it could also be due to overlap between individual
animals and hibernacula or interactions. Several species of interest,
including the endangered Indiana bat, are at grave risk if the
observed mortality continues to expand.

Unfortunately, the current sentiment among cavers is that a
combination of washing and bleach will decontaminate caving gear.
Although I confess my knowledge of confining the spread of fungal
diseases is generally poor, my knowledge of both caving gear and
disinfection -- individually, not together -- is quite good. Put as
frankly as possible, barring autoclaving, there is no simple way to
assure proper disinfection of gear between travels to hibernacula.

Besides deep rubber treads and porous leather uppers on boots, cavers
use a great deal of Nylon in clothing, gear bags, and technical rope
equipment including the rope itself as well as life-supporting
equipment such as harnesses and webbing used for rigging. Chemical
and thermal disinfection of such equipment, which is certainly not
used in all caves, just those that contain vertical or near-vertical
shafts that cannot otherwise reasonably be scaled or descended,
tempts fate due to loss of strength. Such components are too
expensive to be treated as disposable.

Moreover, it is considered sufficient to disinfect boots and
clothing; presumably this is without demonstrated efficacy. See also:
<http://www.caves.org/region/mar/wns.htm>

I have heard some researchers are using Tyvek suits. One doubts the
integrity of such suits if the organism can be spread so readily;
after all, if WNS is spreading in this manner, it is not due to
touching bats -- cavers NEVER touch bats without training and good
reason to do so -- but would almost certainly have to be due to
boots, or perhaps gloves/hands. This would mean the ceiling-dwelling
bats would have to be exposed to an organism transmitted from the
floor, or low on the walls, in wet environments that are not
conducive to dust and aerosol transmission. I would find this route
to be unlikely.

While it is suspected that the problem could be spread by cavers, I
suspect this is not the case; if there are instances in which bats
with WNS are found well outside the areas known to be affected --
particularly Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, and Georgia -- I would be
more likely to believe cavers are a route of transmission. The reason
for this is that cavers routinely travel hundreds of miles to see
more dramatic caves, particularly in these locations, as well as New
Mexico. However, if my understanding of migratory patterns of bats is
correct, bats from the northeast probably hibernate locally while
many bats in the southwest migrate to Mexico and perhaps beyond. If
there is a component involving low temperatures in hibernacula, it
conceivably would be less visible in southern states.

[On 7 Feb 2009 the US Fish and Wildlife Service warned the public to
keep out of caves and mines in New York and Vermont because humans
might be inadvertently spreading the unknown pathogen. The National
Speleological Society has closed all caves it owns in New York and
Pennsylvania, and other caving organizations have urged people to
avoid places where bats may hibernate in the Northeast.

Although the spelunker above makes good points, the disease has so
little known about it, that all precautions, including staying out of
caves is critical to bat survival.

Bats have an ecological effect worldwide. Although the species in the
Northeastern US are not the species that pollinate some plants, the
possible impact and spread to those species is quite great.

The white-nose syndrome (WNS) is as much a mystery as the colony
collapse disorder that has affected the bees. The consequences of
loss of the creatures may be more far reaching than we recognize.

One of the consequences of WNS is the issue of species becoming
extinct. At least 4 endangered species are currently affected. Some
of these species, like the Indiana bat (_Myotis sodalis_), are
seriously affected, with mortality reaching as high as 97 percent in
some caves. Other species, the little brown bats ( _Myotis
lucifugus_), the Eastern pipistrelle (_Pipistrellus subflavus _), and
the northern long-eared bats (_Myotis septentrionalis_) have suffered
with large number of deaths as have the small-footed bats (_Myotis leibii_).
