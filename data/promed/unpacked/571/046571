Global progress towards regional measles elimination, worldwide, 2000-2013
----------------------------------------------------------------
[byline: Robert T Perry, et al]

Background
----------
In 2012, the World Health Assembly endorsed the Global Vaccine Action Plan [The Global Vaccine Action Plan is the implementation plan of the Decade of Vaccines, a collaboration between WHO; United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF); the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; the African Leaders Malaria Alliance; and others to extend, by 2020 and beyond, the full benefit of immunization to all persons, with the objective to eliminate measles in 4 World Health Organization (WHO) regions by 2015. Additional information is available at http://www.who.int/immunization/global_vaccine_action_plan/en and at http://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/wha65/a65_22-en.pdf.

Immunization activities
-----------------------
WHO and UNICEF use data from administrative records and surveys reported annually by member states to estimate coverage with MCV1 and the 2nd dose of MCV (MCV2) through routine immunization services. Since 2003, member states also have reported the number of districts with equal to or over 80 per cent MCV1 coverage. Estimated MCV1 coverage increased globally from 73 per cent to 83 per cent from 2000 to 2009, then remained at 83-84 per cent through 2013. The number of member states with at least 90 per cent MCV1 coverage increased from 84 (44 per cent) in 2000 to 131 (68 per cent) in 2012, then decreased to 129 (66 per cent) in 2013. Among member states with at least 90 per cent MCV1 coverage nationally, the proportion having equal to or over 80 per cent MCV1 coverage in all districts increased from 17 per cent (18 of 104) in 2003 to 43 per cent (56 of 131) in 2012, then declined to 37 per cent (48 of 129) in 2013. Of the estimated 21.5 million infants not receiving MCV1 through routine immunization services in 2013, about 13.2 million (62 per cent) were in 6 member states: India (6.4 million), Nigeria (2.7 million), Pakistan (1.7 million), Ethiopia (1.1 million), Indonesia (0.7 million), and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (0.7 million).

From 2000 to 2013, the number of member states providing MCV2 through routine immunization services increased from 96 (50 per cent) to 148 (76 per cent), with 4 member states introducing MCV2 in 2013. Estimated global MCV2 coverage increased from 15 per cent in 2000 to 53 per cent in 2013. During 2013, about 205 million children received MCV during supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) conducted in 34 member states. Of these, 16 states (47 per cent) reported SIA coverage of at least 95 per cent , and 21 (62 per cent) provided one or more additional child health interventions during the SIA (table 2: see uRL above).

Disease incidence
-----------------
Countries report annually to WHO and UNICEF the number of measles cases from either case-based or aggregate surveillance systems. Effective measles surveillance includes case-based surveillance with laboratory testing to confirm cases. In 2013, a total of 187 (96 per cent) member states used case-based surveillance, and 191 (98 per cent) had access to standardized quality-controlled testing through the WHO Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network.

During 2000-2013, the number of annual reported measles cases worldwide decreased 67 per cent, from 853 479 to 279 776, and measles incidence decreased 72 per cent, from 146 to 40 cases per million population. The results for 2013 represent an increase from 227 739 reported cases and an incidence of 33 cases per million population in 2012, despite fewer member states reporting (189 in 2012 versus 176 in 2013). The percentage of reporting member states with under 5 cases per million increased from 64 per cent in 2012 (120 of 189) to 66 per cent in 2013 (116 of 176). During 2000-2013, the Region of the Americas maintained measles incidence at below 5 cases per million.

The increase in measles incidence in 2013 was largely the result of outbreaks reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (89 108 cases), Nigeria (52 852), China (26 883), Pakistan (8749), Angola (8523), Indonesia (8419), Uganda (7878), Georgia (7872), and Turkey (7405). Reported cases in India declined from 33 634 in 2011 to 13 833 in 2013.

Genotypes of measles virus sequences were reported by 61 (56 per cent) of the 108 member states reporting measles cases in 2013 [Sequences were for the 450 nucleotide carboxy-terminal of the nucleocapsid gene in the measles virus genome]. Genotypes isolated from 3 cases of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (D3, D6, and D7) were excluded from the total], data as of 7 Oct 2014 from the Measles Nucleotide Surveillance (MeaNS) database, available at http://www.who-measles.org. Of 2301 measles virus sequences reported to WHO, the genotype was B3 for 438 sequences (31 member states), D4 for 127 (19 member states), D8 for 1555 (40 member states), D9 for 82 (13 member states), G3 for 15 (one member state) and H1 for 81 (9 member states). Five genotypes were reported in the Region of the Americas and WPR; 3 genotypes were reported in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR), EUR and the South East Asia Region; and one genotype was reported in the African Region.

Mortality estimates
-------------------
WHO has developed a model to estimate measles mortality in member states using numbers and age distribution of reported cases, routine and SIA MCV coverage, and age-specific, country-specific case fatality ratios. New measles vaccination coverage and case data for all member states during 2000-2013 led to a new series of mortality estimates. During this period, estimated measles deaths decreased 75 per cent, from 544 200 to 145 700, and all regions had substantial reductions in estimated measles mortality. Compared with no measles vaccination, an estimated 15.6 million deaths were prevented by measles vaccination during 2000-2013.

Regional verification of measles elimination
--------------------------------------------
By 2013, RVCs had been established in the Region of the Americas, EUR, EMR, and WPR, and all RVCs have met except for EMR. The annual RVC report from the Region of the Americas indicated that the region continues to have multiple measles virus importations, whereas 3 member states in WPR and 16 member states in EUR have documented the absence of endemic measles virus transmission to their RVC.

Discussion
----------
Between 2000 and 2013, coverage worldwide with both routine doses of MCV combined with SIAs contributed to a 72 per cent decrease in reported measles incidence and a 75 per cent reduction in estimated measles mortality. The decrease in measles mortality was one of 3 main contributors (along with decreases in pneumonia and diarrhea) to the decline in overall mortality in children aged under 5 years and towards progress toward the 4th Millennium Development Goals. However, based on current trends of measles vaccination coverage and incidence, the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization concluded that the 2015 global targets will not be achieved on time; little progress has been made toward measles elimination in EMR and EUR, and progress in WPR is at risk.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Pakistan together accounted for 28 per cent of global population but over 60 per cent of children not reached with MCV1, and over 70 per cent of estimated global measles deaths in 2013. In these member states, child health systems will need to be strengthened to ensure that their immunization programs reach at least 95 per cent of children with 2 MCV doses through routine immunization services and high-quality SIAs.

Conclusions
-----------
During 2000-2013, an estimated 15.6 million deaths were prevented by measles vaccination. The number of member states providing MCV2 through routine immunization services increased to 148 (76 per cent) in 2013, and global MCV2 coverage was 53 per cent. During 2013, a total of 205 million children were vaccinated against measles during supplementary immunization activities. Large outbreaks continued in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (89 108 cases), India (13 822 cases), and Pakistan (8749 cases), and new outbreaks were reported from Nigeria (52 852), and China (26 883).

[The final verdict is that the African, Eastern Mediterranean, and European regions are not progressing as expected to achieve their elimination targets, and the Western Pacific Region is at risk. It is concluded that to accelerate progress toward achieving these regional measles elimination targets, policy and practice gaps preventing reaching greater numbers of children will need to be addressed, visibility of measles elimination efforts increased, and adequate resources provided to strengthen health systems and achieve the objectives of the Global Vaccine Action Plan. - Mod.CP]

http://www.unicef.org/media/media_77911.html


UNICEF today [13 Nov 2014] expressed alarm at new data showing that the number of child deaths from measles jumped from an estimated 122 000 in 2012 to 145 700 in 2013. The latest figures, published in this week's and WHO's Weekly Epidemiological Record [see part (1) above] show that although an estimated 15.6 million deaths have been prevented by measles vaccination between 2000 and 2013, progress has stalled, and previous gains are being reversed. "This is very worrying, because if current trends continue, more children will suffer the effects of this highly dangerous, extremely contagious, but easily preventable disease," said Jos Vandelaer, head of UNICEF's immunization programmes. "Measles is affecting the poorest children, from families for which seeking treatment can have a devastating impact on household income."

Only 84 per cent of the world's children received their 1st dose of measles vaccine in 2013, leaving 21.5 million children vulnerable to this highly contagious disease. Three out of every 5 children not vaccinated live in just 6 countries -- India, Nigeria, Pakistan, Ethiopia, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo -- where vaccination coverage for measles and other diseases remains patchy and inconsistent. Failure to vaccinate against measles leaves children at risk of serious health complications, including pneumonia, diarrhoea, brain damage, blindness and death. Vaccination, which is cheap and easily administered, has been proven as one of the best investments a country can make in its children.

Since 2000, some 1.7 billion children have received measles vaccination through measles vaccination campaigns with support from UNICEF. "A number of global goals for measles elimination are now at risk," Vandelaer added. "These trends should be taken seriously by those with the ability and the responsibility to reverse them."

The Guam Department of Public Health and Social Services (DPHSS) recommends that travellers heading to Hawaii receive vaccinations for measles 2 weeks before departing. A press release issued today [14 Nov 2014] from DPHSS states that the Hawaii State Department of Public Health is reporting an outbreak of measles. As of 10 Nov 2014, the Hawaii health department has reported 11 cases of measles, according to the release. Five of the cases originated from Bali, Indonesia; the Philippines; and Los Angeles.

"With the upcoming holidays and due to frequent travel of residents between Guam and Hawaii, it is possible that the disease may be brought here," the release states. The DPHSS encourages parents to review their children's shot record to ensure they've received the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine. The release states that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends: children should receive 2 doses of MMR vaccine, with the 1st dose given at one year of age or older and the 2nd dose given between 4 to 6 years of age. All persons born during or after 1957 should have documentation of at least one dose of MMR vaccine given on or after the 1st birthday.

http://outbreaknewstoday.com/philippines-records-100-measles-deaths-in-1st-ten-months-of-2014/


Philippines has topped 100 [deaths] during the 1st 10 months of 2014, according to the WHO Western Pacific Region Measles-Rubella Bulletin from October 2014. From 1 Jan through 20 Oct 2014, the Philippines had reported 102 measles deaths, so high that the total accounts for 78 per cent of all measles deaths in the region this year [2014] (131).

To date, 53 810 suspected cases of measles, including 17 893 confirmed cases, have been reported on the archipelago. This is up from 48 777 suspected and confirmed cases one month earlier. Elsewhere in the region, China has reported nearly 100 000 cases, while Viet Nam has seen 16 384 suspected measles cases, including 5281 confirmed cases and 2 measles deaths. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] reports that as of 31 Oct 2014, 23 US travelers who returned from the Philippines have become sick with measles. Most of these cases were among unvaccinated people. CDC recommends that travelers to the Philippines protect themselves by making sure they are vaccinated against measles, particularly infants 6-11 months of age (one dose of measles vaccine) and children 12 months of age or older (2 doses of measles vaccine). Clinicians should keep measles in mind when treating patients with fever and rash, especially if the patient has recently traveled internationally.

Measles or rubeola, is an acute, highly communicable viral disease that is characterized by Koplik spots in the cheek or tongue very early in the disease. A couple of days later, a red blotchy rash appears 1st on the face, and then spreads, lasting 4-7 days. Other symptoms include fever, cough and red, watery eyes. The patient may be contagious from 4 days prior to the rash appearance to 4 days after rash appearance. The disease is more severe in infants than adults. Complications from measles, which is reported in up to 20 percent of people infected, include seizures, pneumonia, deafness and encephalitis.

This year [2014], the United States is experiencing a record number of measles cases. From 1 Jan to 31 Oct 2014, there have been 603 confirmed measles cases reported to CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD). This is the highest number of cases since measles elimination was documented in the U.S. in 2000.

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed yesterday [11 Nov 2014] that the recent case of measles stemming from a single family in Nantou continued to expand as a 5th measles case was discovered in an 18 month old boy, making this the most serious case of familial disease clustering in 5 years.

According to CDC deputy director-general Chou Jih-haw, the boy, who is the nephew of the 3rd infected person, was hospitalized for a high fever, with doctors later confirming that he was infected with measles. Chou also said that since the boy had received an MMR vaccination 3 months ago, he showed only minor symptoms and had already be discharged from the local hospital.

Although the CDC believes that the boy will not be as contagious as the other cases, medical staff will keep tracking the health conditions of the 26 people who had been in contact with the boy. In addition to those who had contact with the infected family members, there are a total of 540 people whose conditions are being supervised by the CDC, as they may be infected with the disease. These people will be under observation until 15 Nov 2014.

Based on the CDC's statistics, there have been 26 measles cases this year [2014]. Among them, 18 became infected overseas, including 6 from mainland China, 6 from the Philippines, 2 from Indonesia, 2 from Viet Nam, one from Hong Kong and one from Malaysia. The CDC reminded citizens to take extra care when visiting mainland China and Southeast Asia. If symptoms such as runny nose, rashes and fever appear after traveling to these places, people should go to local hospitals as soon as possible and report their past whereabouts as well as contact history to their doctor.

People who travelled on an international flight which landed in Auckland earlier this month [November 2014] are being advised that a child on the flight has since developed measles. The 15 month old child, from Taranaki, contracted measles while overseas and returned to New Zealand, via Auckland on 2 Nov 2014.

The child and parents travelled on the following flights; the child would have been infectious while on the flights.

- 1 Nov 2014: Sri Lankan Airlines (UL 124) - India to Sri Lanka.
- 2 Nov 2014: Sri Lankan Airlines (UL 318) - Sri Lanka to Malaysia.
- 2 Nov 2014: Malaysia Airlines (MH 133) - Malaysia to Auckland (arriving 2350)

It can take 10-14 days for someone who has caught measles to start showing any symptoms. Anyone on these flights who may have caught measles should be starting to feel unwell, if they're not already, by 16 Nov 2014. Any passengers from these flights who feel unwell should phone their GP or call Healthline on 0800 611 116 for advice. It is important to call 1st before seeing a doctor because measles is highly infectious, and people with measles can infect others in the waiting room.

Unimmunised people who have had contact with a person with measles will normally be advised to stay at home and away from all public places, school or work for 14 days after their contact. Vaccination is particularly important if you are planning to travel anywhere overseas to protect yourself and to help prevent outbreaks in New Zealand.
