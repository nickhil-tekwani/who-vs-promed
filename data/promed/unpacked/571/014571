----------------------------------------------------------------
The following background data on scrub typhus in China are abstracted from Gideon http://www.GideonOnline.com and the Gideon e-book series. [1,2] Primary references are available on request.

Time and Place:
Although "chigger fever" may have been described in China as early as 313 C.E., the disease was 1st reported in Kunming (Yunnan Province) in 1942. Foci of scrub typhus exist in Jiangsu, Liaoning, Shandong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Jilin, Jinan, Heilongjiang, Hainan, Hunchun, Tibet, Hang Zhou City and Tianjin City. The disease was 1st reported in Hubei Province in 1997. Newly-discovered foci were reported in the Nan Peng Lie Islands in 2002 and in Fuyang City, Anhui Province in 2008.

Epidemics occur approximately every 20 years, with variable clinical severity (the most severe disease reported from Shanxi Province). In most of the country, cases tend to appear in May, peak during June and July, and decrease in August. Peak incidence in Sichuan and Yunnan occurs in August, and September to November in Shandong. Most cases of scrub typhus in Hong Kong are reported in adults, and during the summer and fall.

Yearly incidence data are not available for China as a whole; however, reports from Hong Kong and other regional countries suggest that rates of scrub typhus have been increasing since the 1980s (see graph [3]: http://cdn.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/ScrubTyphus1.png).

Additional geographic notes:
Fujian - More than 1 percent of persons on Pingtan Island developed scrub typhus during the 1950's, with a case-fatality rate (CFR) of 13.6 percent. 28 cases were reported on the island during 2000 to 2005.
Guangzhou - More than 500 cases were reported during 1952 to 1954, 5.4 percent fatal.
Hainan - More than 10 000 cases were reported during 1956 to 1985.
Hong Kong - 136 cases (0 fatal) of scrub typhus were reported in Hong Kong during 1999 to 2008
Shandong - 1291 cases were reported during 2006 to 2010 -- 49.5 percent were above age 55, and male/female ratio was 1/1.02. 480 cases were reported from Feixian County during 1995 to 2006; and 56 cases of pediatric infection were reported in Fei County during 1993 to 2004.

Prevalence surveys:
- 16.13 percent of mice in Xinyang, Henan Province (2007 publication)

Seroprevalence surveys:
- 36.1 percent of healthy persons in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region (1980's)
- 31.8 percent of persons on Hainan Island (1983)
- 6.3 percent of healthy farmers in Yiyuan County, Shandong Province (2005 = to 2007)
- 1.8 percent to 39.8 percent of farm workers near Tianjin (2007 to 2009)

Reservoirs:
The local reservoirs are _Rattus flavipectus_, _R. niviventer_, _R. losea_, _R. rattus_, _R. norvegicus_, _R. confucianus_, and _Apodemis agrarius_. Rodents and mites coinfected by _Hantavirus_ and _Orientia tsutsugamushi_ have been identified in endemic areas. A known mite vector, _Leptotrombidium scutellare_, has been identified on 30 species of rodents in Yunnan.

Vectors:
The local vectors are _Leptotrombidium pallidum_, _L. deliense_ (Hong Kong), _L. scutellare_ (Shandong Province and Yunnan Province), and _L. gaohuensis_ (Zhejiang Province). _L. intermedium_ has also been identified as a possible vector.

Published outbreaks:
- 1986 -- An outbreak (138 cases) of scrub typhus was reported in Menying County, Shandong Province.
- 2007 (publication year) -- An outbreak (19 cases) was reported in Henan Province.
