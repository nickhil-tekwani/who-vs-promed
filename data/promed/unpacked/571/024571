Under the Twitter hashtag [https://bit.ly/2QUA8VN] a discussion of local and international humanitarian aid workers started to report a non-verified case number of about 100 000 patients and 119 deaths. While some reports speak of "hemorrhagic fever" no specific symptoms are given. Previous media reported a chikungunya outbreak (https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/health-ministry-declares-chikunguya-outbreak-kassala), while others such as https://allafrica.com/stories/201806040624.html point to severe forms of dengue fever. However, nobody reported symptoms, laboratory tests conducted and confirmed, differential diagnoses, etc. However, this ongoing epidemic seems to be neglected by local authorities and the international public health community.

A medical source familiar with the failure to disclose the illness of dozens of citizens of an unknown fever hit large parts of the neighborhoods of the city of Al-Fashir, capital of the state of North Darfur, causing confusion among the medical staff working in the educational hospital in Al-Fashir.

The medical source, who declined to be named, said that Al-Fashir Teaching Hospital recorded on Friday night [21 Sep 2018] about 90 cases of an unidentified fever similar to what appeared in the state of Kassala over the last days.

"The sick are from different neighborhoods of the city, with ages ranging from 20 to 25 years, of both sexes."

He said that the hospital administration had taken the necessary action, and it was later found that among the sick some were infected with malaria, while it was not clear why the others died.

Some of them had left the hospital to their homes after undergoing medical checkups, and activists through social networking sites called on state authorities to take care of the unknown feces and immediately investigate them as soon as possible.

Update [from Crofsblogs https://bit.ly/2PYoCYw]: As the map [https://bit.ly/2QZxcrg] shows, Al-Fashir [Al Fasher] is far to the west to Kassala, so this outbreak may be spreading by people leaving Kassala. And such people may be going all over Sudan, or into other countries. None of these countries have robust healthcare systems or much media freedom, so whatever the disease may be, it's likely to be widespread before gaining official notice.

[From the report above, this outbreak of undiagnosed illness appears to be spreading beyond Kassala region in Sudan. There have been media reports that speculate on chikungunya or severe dengue fever as possible causes of a situation complicated by the presence of endemic malaria, yellow fever, and Rift Valley fever, which are vector-borne. Other possible causes could be hepatitis E or typhoid, however, limited information is available on the actual number of cases, clinical presentation, course of illness, laboratory data, and outcome of cases.

The following information has been received today [24 Sep 2018] from an EpiCore member who has requested anonymity:

"The disease in Kassala is diagnosed as a chikungunya outbreak; [there are] 100 000 patients with severe fever and more than 100 deaths up to now. No clear diagnosis for Al-Fashir disease."

It is important to note that chikungunya is not generally a fatal condition and the possibility of more than one pathogen associated with this outbreak cannot be ruled out. The case numbers in both reports and the EpiCore response above indicate this is a serious emerging public health situation and merits further investigation for response and control.

ProMED thanks the EpiCore member for this response. Any additional clinical and epidemiological information about this outbreak and the control measures being instituted will be appreciated. - Mod.UBA
