Factors Affecting the Case Fatality Ratio
-----------------------------------------
In addition to the inoculum, other factors affecting the case fatality
ratio could be a higher denominator (i.e., better case finding and/or
inclusion of a broader spectrum of illness in the case definition) or
increases in the sensitivity of the laboratory test.
Does anyone dare consider that the estimates of the case fatality rate from
the Zaire experience were possibly inflated or overestimated? An important
question in this debate is how the denominators were defined and obtained
in each of the case fatality ratio assessments.

Ebola Mortality: Comments
---------------------------------------------
I believe it has already been stated correctly that much of the imputed
reduction in mortality in the current Ebola hemorrhagic fever outbreak in
Uganda is most likely related to the fact that the virus strain is closest
to that of Sudan '76 and '79; and distinct from those of the former Zaire
where death fractions were 75-88%.
It is certain that we had little to offer and no understanding of this
disease in either Sudan or Zaire in 1976. See Bulletin WHO 56:247 and 271,
1978 for reports of those original outbreaks.
While I am most impressed with the training, facilities and steadfast
effort of the national team in Gulu, it is far from clear that even good
fluid and electrolyte management will save many lives. The infection rates
in medical staff are alarming in both the present and previous epidemics.
Uganda, Africa and international public health have lost a fine champion in
Dr. Matthew Lokwiya. The high mortality among care givers at his facility
may be due to a dose phenomenon, but we have no such evidence from prior
outbreaks, nor from studies of non-human primates. It may equally be a
consequence of the extreme fatigue and both emotional and physical stress
that are inevitably integral to such an acute and continuing medical drama.
Let us hope that final control of this fourth major Ebola epidemic is imminent.

[It is apparent that the information necessary to resolve the issues
surrounding the case fatality ratio in the current Uganda outbreak is not
available. Karl Johnson's comments are a suitable point at which to sever
this thread. - Mod.CP
