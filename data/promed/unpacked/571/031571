Uganda Lions Have "AIDS"
--------------------------
Kampala - A virus closely related to the one causing AIDS has been detected
in 80% of the lions sampled in Queen Elizabeth National Park. Dr. Ludwig
Siefert, a wildlife health lecturer at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine,
Makerere University, said the bug, named Feline Immunodeficiency Virus
(FIV), made lions succumb to diseases, such as tuberculosis, a disease they
otherwise resist.
The incurable disease, also called cat AIDS, is transmitted through bite
wounds, suckling and mating. It affects domestic and wild carnivores but
not human beings.
Speaking to The New Vision during the opening of the wildlife department at
the faculty of veterinary medicine, Siefert said the lions still looked
healthy but were at a high risk of falling sick. The signs include
progressive wasting and recurrent fevers.
"We know FIV can lower the immunity. It is like AIDS. We are monitoring the
lions. If there is an outbreak, we know what to do," he said.
He said tuberculosis (TB) had been detected in prey animals such as
buffaloes and warthogs, posing a threat to the lions with FIV stresses.
Lions can contract TB by eating infected prey animals. The park has about
200 lions.
The same survey revealed a high prevalence of a dog disease called canine
distemper, among the lions in the park. Siefert said hyenas could have
picked the viruses from domestic carnivores and transmitted them to lions.
He said the dogs and cats around the park had been vaccinated, but the
lions would not be vaccinated yet.
"There is a very strong demand by tourists to view certain species, so we
want to see them healthy," he said. "I am not sure if lions can transfer
the disease to domestic animals. It is the other way round," he said.
