Two new cases of hepatitis have been reported in a health scare involving patients of a Tulsa oral surgeon whose clinics were found to be unsanitary. The Tulsa Health Department says 2 new cases of hepatitis C were found among the thousands of Dr. W. Scott Harrington's patients who have been tested since March 2013.

A total of 73 patients have tested positive for hepatitis C, 5 for hepatitis B, and 3 for HIV, but there is no indication that the diseases spread at the clinics. Health experts also say the spread of disease in dental clinics is extremely rare.

More than 4000 of Harrington's patients have been tested so far. Inspectors said they found unsanitary conditions inside Harrington's clinics at Tulsa and Owasso. Harrington is cooperating with the investigation.

[By 19 Apr 2013, 57 people among the 3122 tested by that date had contracted hepatitis C virus infection, presumably as a result of attendance at this particular dental practice. Genotyping of these isolates had established their genetic relatedness, supporting the epidemiologic findings and indicating a common source of infection.

In the absence of sequencing of the genome of these 2 new isolates or characterisation of them in some other manner, it is not possible to attribute them directly to malpractice at Dr. Scott Harrington's clinic. It would seem appropriate to clarify this matter. - Mod.CP
