A highly pathogenic avian influenza virus has been detected in a dead fox in Sapporo, the capital of the northernmost Japan prefecture of Hokkaido, prefectural officials said. This marked the first case of bird flu being detected in a mammal in the country, according to the Environment Ministry.

An H5 subtype bird flu virus has been detected in 5 of 7 crows found dead on [29 Mar 2022]. The fox was found on Thursday [31 Mar 2021] in an area close to the point where the crows were collected, according to prefectural officials and other sources.

The fox is believed to have been infected with the bird flu by eating the dead crows, according to ministry and prefectural officials. The transmission risk of avian influenza to humans is low, but the flu can kill a large number of poultry if an outbreak occurs on farms.

[Infections by HPAI viruses in mammals are not common, but foxes have shown to be susceptible to infection by HPAI H5N1 and H5N8, and there have been recent reports of cases in wild red foxes in Europe.

Virus evolution and adaptive mutations must be closely monitored to rapidly identify viruses with increased potential to infect mammals. - Mod.PMB
