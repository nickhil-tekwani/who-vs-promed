[Posting 20120914.1294622 included the following sentence: "The spread to this [high] altitude is highly unusual, as the virus is transmitted by a tropical mosquito."

The ProMED-mail moderator comment said: "The reference to "tropical mosquitoes" is in need of clarification. So far, SBV has been detected only in midges (_Culicoides_). However, the entomological aspects of this disease are clearly in need of further research."

The kind, responding clarification by the Swiss Federal Veterinary Office is gratefully acknowledged. - Mod.AS
