The H5N8 bird flu virus was first detected in a dead wild swan in Oud-Heverlee (Flemish Brabant), the Federal Agency for Safety in the Food Chain (Afsca) said in a statement. It reminds holders of poultry and other birds that they must "properly apply the mandatory measures to protect their animals against this virus."

"This is the 1st confirmed case in Belgium among wildlife," said Federal Agriculture Minister Willy Borsus, in the statement. "This shows that the risk is still present," he said, recalling that "several hundred cases have been detected for several months in Europe in a total of 27 countries". Afsca experts believe that the contamination of the wild swan is "certainly" not a unique case.

The 1st H5N8 outbreak in Belgium was identified on 1 Feb 2017 in a captive bird-keeper's premises in Lebbeke (East Flanders).

Afsca reports that no further measures are taken but mandatory measures remain applicable to all holders of poultry and other birds until 10 Mar 2017. These measures could then be extended.

Concretely, the animals of hobbyists (individuals, amateurs) and professionals must be confined. Holding them in open air under nets is allowed, says the Agency. In addition, the animals must be fed and watered inside (the netting or houses). No untreated surface water can be used.

Markets, gatherings, and other events involving poultry and/or other birds of several holders are prohibited.

However, the temporary buffer zone demarcated on 1 Feb 2017 around the focus in Lebbeke will be lifted in the night from [Tue 21 to Wed 22 Feb 2017], announces Afsca. The transport of birds, poultry, and hatching eggs will again be authorized in Lebbeke, Aalst, and Dendermonde as of [Wed 22 Feb 2017].

[Belgium has reported to the OIE, so far, a single outbreak of HPAI H5N8. The notification, submitted on 3 Feb 2017, addressed a holding of ornamental birds. The current case in a swan underlines circulation of the virus in wild birds, challenging domestic birds (poultry). The virus has already infected poultry farms in 3 of Belgium's neighboring countries: Germany, Netherlands, and France. Luxembourg remains the only country in the region which has not (yet) reported the disease.

During the last 2 days (23-24 Feb 2017), the following European countries have submitted to the OIE reports on new HPAI H5N8 outbreaks:
- Hungary: 19 new outbreaks

Czech veterinarians have confirmed the 1st outbreak of bird flu in the Pilsen [Plzensky] region. A small poultry breeder from the village of Bohy has found 20 dead hens with tests later proving the presence of the H5 virus. Another outbreak has been reported from Dacice in South Bohemia [Jihocesky]. Overall, there are currently 32 cases of bird flu outbreaks in the country. While the H5 strain of bird flu is highly dangerous for birds, it has never caused illness in human beings.
