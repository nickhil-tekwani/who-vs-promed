This report describes a 61-year-old man on ustekinumab, a biologic immunomodulator which affects interleukin [IL] 12 and 23, with bacteremic and pneumonic tularaemia without defined animal or tick exposures, in a semi-rural Northern Canadian setting. The mechanism of action of ustekinumab would suggest it may impair specific host intracellular defences against _Francisella tularensis_, and thus tularaemia should be a clinical consideration if patients exposed to IL12/23 inhibitors present with compatible illness, even with only a geographic exposure history.

Case: A 61-year-old man from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada was blood culture positive for _F. tularensis_, after admission to hospital for pneumonia, sepsis, and gastroenteritis on 17 Jun 2012. He experienced a subacute onset of weakness, shortness of breath, and cough, with development of vomiting, diarrhea, and weight loss for 6 weeks prior to admission. There were no rashes, lymphadenopathy, or obvious fever. While at his lake property in Northern Alberta he had an acute deterioration and at hospital admission was febrile at 39.2 deg C [102.6 deg F], and both chest x-ray and CT scan of the chest revealed a right middle lobe lateral segment opacity, small right pleural effusion, and reactive lymph nodes.

His laboratory work showed a progressive lymphocytosis over his stay and he had a mild acute kidney injury at initial assessment, which normalized over his hospital stay. A blood culture obtained on 16 Jun 2012 became positive after 4 days of incubation, with gram negative coccobacilli subsequently confirmed to be _F. tularensis_ susceptible to ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, and gentamicin. His therapy was changed to high dose ciprofloxacin to complete 3 weeks total of antimicrobial therapy. He has been followed clinically with no evidence of relapse to date.

The patient has a relevant medical history of chronic alcohol use and formerly severe psoriasis, on Stelara (ustekinumab) for the past 2.5 years, with prior use of an anti-TNF [anti-tumor necrosis factor] agent. Epidemiologically, the patient spends 3 days per week at his lake property, which was his only evident risk history in terms of acquiring _F. tularensis_ infection. He hadn't gone hunting for 20 years, doesn't fish or trap, and he had no exposure to rodents or lagomorphs in the wild. There are wild hares around this property but he does not recall any exposures to live or dead hares when mowing his yard.

Tularaemia is reported to occur in wild animals in all jurisdictions in Canada except the Yukon and Nunavut, most frequently in beaver, muskrat, and snowshoe hares. Worldwide, this zoonosis occurs in the Northern Hemisphere, with foci throughout North America, Europe, and northern Asia.

Reviewing the pathophysiology of tularaemia in view of this patient immunomodulating therapy, there are data suggesting that TNF-alfa, Il-10, Il-12, and gamma interferon are important in evoking an early T-cell independent host defence, as well as driving an expansion of a protective TH1 cell response. This intracellular organism is known to be phagocytosed by monocytes and macrophages, and then it escapes the phagosome and replicates in the cytosol. Host cell response in the in vitro setting suggests significant upregulation of IL-23 as well as IL-12 production early in infection, suggesting that IL-23 and IL-12 play important roles in these host defence events.

Therefore, it would appear to be very likely that ustekinumab is a significant risk factor for infection after what would appear to be a trivial exposure to _F. tularensis_. The patient indicated a strong preference to remain on his therapy, given significant quality-of-life issues related to his psoriasis in the past. In consultation with his dermatologist, his medication was stopped and alternate psoriasis therapy offered.

Clinicians should be aware of this potential association when evaluating infections in patients on IL 12/23 inhibitors, as beta-lactam based therapies commonly used for empiric therapy of sepsis would not be effective, and culture results can be delayed. The only currently licensed medication with this mechanism is ustekinumab, which is indicated in psoriasis, and is under evaluation for Crohn's disease and sarcoidosis.

(This case is also being submitted for publication, and was reported to the manufacturer of the drug.)

[Many cases of tularemia involve lymph node infection with (ulceroglandular) or without (glandular) a local skin infection draining to the lymph node. Cases associated with lawn mowers, as has been described on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts, are often pneumonic, related to inhalation of bacilli. This may have been a factor in this case. Unlike human plague infection, pneumonic tularemia does not spread from person to person. Bloodstream infection (bacteremia) can be associated with different forms of disease or may be the only manifestation (typhoidal form).
