Taranaki's 6th case of bovine tuberculosis has been confirmed. The Animal Health Board (AHB) said last week that a herd near Inglewood was suspected of having the disease.

The confirmation this week of the infection brings to 4 the number of herds near Inglewood with the disease. Two herds near Opunake also have it.

The new infection near Inglewood related to movements of animals between the infected herds, and there was also a direct movement relationship between the 2 Opunake herds, AHB regional coordinator Frank Pavitt, of Hamilton, said. "So we know why these herds have been infected."

He hoped that the Taranaki outbreak, in which the 1st case was detected in January 2013, would be confined to the 6 herds already identified.

"We hope we're coming to the end of our investigation and that we've identified all the infections that are present. But it's still a work in progress. It's a dynamic investigation, so we don't know when it will be fully completed."

Pavitt said movements from the herd where the infection had just been confirmed would now have to be examined.

The AHB is holding meetings for farmers within a 10-km radius of the infected herds in the Opunake and Inglewood areas on 21 May 2013.

Pavitt said it was contacting all farmers in the 2 areas about the meetings. They were being sent factsheets about the infections in their area and about the new annual testing regime for cattle and deer over 12 months of age that will now be set in place.

[The primary cause of tuberculosis in cattle is the bacterium _Mycobacterium bovis_. This bacterium is in the same family as bacteria that cause Johne's disease and leprosy. Adult cattle are usually infected by inhaling invisible droplets containing the bacteria into their lungs, while pre-weaned calves are more often infected by drinking contaminated milk. The route of entry will ultimately determine the clinical signs of the disease.

Since the bacteria are usually inhaled into the lungs in adult cows, the commonest clinical signs are related to pulmonary tuberculosis. Once the bacteria enter the lungs, they begin to multiply and generally spread to the lymph nodes near the lungs. At this primary site of infection, the lesions can remain quietly inactive or develop further depending on the ability of the cow to fight off the infection. When the immune system of the cow is fully activated, the infection may remain limited to the lungs and could go undetected for the productive life of the cow. If the infection over-powers the body defenses, the bacteria may be carried to other locations in the body in the lymph or blood circulation. New areas of infection often occur in the lungs, kidneys, liver, spleen, and the lymph nodes associated with these organs. In cases allowed to progress over an extended period of time, lesions may be present in the uterus or mammary gland.

When calves are exposed to the tuberculosis bacteria in the milk, the commonest lesions are noted in the lymph nodes at the junction of the neck and head around the throat. The main sign may be swelling of these nodes. The primary lesions in calves, however, are most frequently located in the lymph nodes along the intestinal tract.

Other species of _Mycobacterium_ may complicate the diagnosis of tuberculosis in cattle caused by _M. bovis_, but cattle are resistant to these infections, and they rarely cause infections with clinical signs. _M. avium_, causing infection by ingestion and lesions in the intestinal tract of adult cows, and _M. tuberculosis_, the main cause of human tuberculosis, are 2 of these species. They cause the cattle to be sensitive to tuberculin testing and give false positive reactions when tests are being conducted to find cows with _M. bovis_ infections. These other bacteria are more important as causes of infection in swine, sheep, goats, and humans.

Live, infected cattle are diagnosed as being infected with _M. bovis_ with the tuberculin test. The appropriate tuberculin is purified protein derivative (PPD), as it is specific and not costly to produce. In the US, the tuberculin is injected into the caudal fold of the tail near the tail head by a federally accredited veterinarian. A 0.1 ml dose of PPD is injected intradermally. Infected cows will have an allergic type reaction to the PPD at the injection site. The test is read in 72 hours by palpating the injection site for the allergic swelling. When sufficient swelling is found to indicate infection with mycobacteria, follow-up testing is usually performed by state officials to determine that the swelling is due to _M. bovis_ and not a different type of mycobacterium.

Nationwide, there is active surveillance at slaughter plants. State and federal meat inspectors check the lymph glands and other organs of each cow for signs of tuberculosis. When any signs suspicious of tuberculosis are found, tissues are collected and sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratories for confirmation. If bovine tuberculosis is confirmed, trace-back studies are performed to find the herd of origin. The most effective means of control in a tuberculosis herd is to depopulate the entire herd and compensate the owners. Otherwise, the herd will be quarantined and tested repeatedly until all evidence of infection is eliminated.

Tuberculosis is a slow, insidious disease that can lurk for quite a while before rearing its head. Unfortunately, the best tests, as noted above, do not always detect this disease in its earliest stages.

Science has been hard at work trying to develop a better test for this disease but has not yet succeeded.

Wildlife reservoirs, such as the brush-tailed opossums tend to be part of the problem with this disease. In brush-tailed opossums, bovine tuberculosis is usually a fulminating pulmonary disease that typically lasts 2 to 6 months. In the final stage of the disease, animals become disoriented, cannot climb, and may be seen wandering about in daylight.

Once this strain has been genotyped, it will be clearer how these herds became infected. I have not seen a report of the genotype of the situation.
