Two Missouri deer test positive for chronic wasting disease
-----------------------------------------------------------
Jefferson City, MO: The Missouri Department of Agriculture (MDA) has received 2 additional positive test results for chronic wasting disease (CWD) in white-tailed deer harvested at a captive wildlife facility in Macon County. Depopulation is continuing at the facility, with about 320 animals harvested and tested since the facility's first positive result was found in October 2011. MDA has received negative test results for about 280 animals, with results pending from the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) for the roughly 40 remaining samples. The current harvest and testing protocol requires the facility to remain under its current quarantine until all animals have been harvested and tested for CWD, a neurological disease found in deer, elk, and moose. There is no evidence that CWD can be transmitted to humans or non-cervid animals, such as livestock and household pets.

[It seems this is almost a blow-by-blow account of each animal harvested and tested but it is clearly a transparent way for MDA to operate. One wonders if there might be a better use for these animals than the current method, harvest and test, perhaps some research into this disease?
