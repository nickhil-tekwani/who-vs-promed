Hamilton County health officials say 39 people got sick Labor Day weekend
because a food worker at [a country club didn't wash his hands properly.
Club members who dined on cold cuts and salads ingested a virus that
triggered two-day bouts of vomiting and diarrhea in those affected, said
Tim Ingram, Hamilton County health commissioner. "It's not
life-threatening at all. Nobody was hospitalized," Mr. Ingram said. "But it
does ruin a couple days of your life."
The bug is similar to the Norwalk viruses, named after the Ohio town that
had the first documented outbreak in 1968. Norwalk-like viruses do not
grab headlines like the recent outbreaks of the potentially deadly _E.
coli_ bacteria, but they rank among the most common causes of food-borne
illness. Symptoms of a Norwalk-like virus include nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea and abdominal pain. Symptoms usually begin 24 to 48 hours after
ingesting tainted food or water and clear up within two or three days.
Victims can spread the virus to close contacts for up to 10 days.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated
180 000 people a year catch a Norwalk-like virus. Large outbreaks in recent
years have occurred among cruise ship passengers, hotel guests, restaurant
patrons, schoolchildren, and people eating shellfish tainted by sewage.
At the [country club, health officials say a sick worker, who either
didn't wash his hands after using the restroom or didn't wash them
properly, spread the virus as he prepared deli-style foods. All the
patrons who got sick ate at the club between Sept. 3 and Sept. 6, Mr.
Ingram said. The club sent the sick worker home Sept. 7.
After receiving a tip, the county health department inspected the club
Sept. 8, finding nothing unusual except for the sick worker. Health
officials compiled a list of 39 people who reported that they got sick. Of
those, 37 ate at the country club and two were relatives of initial
victims. No new cases linked to the outbreak have been reported, Mr. Ingram
said. "It's over now," Mr. Ingram said. "If there's a message here, it's
that hand-washing is extremely important. And if restaurant managers know
of a sick food handler, they should send them home right away and make sure
they get checked by a doctor."

[Norwalk virus is a member of the family Caliciviridae. Two questions: (1)
Where did the food handler acquire his infection? (2) Why didn't his mother
teach him to wash his hands? - Mod.CHC
