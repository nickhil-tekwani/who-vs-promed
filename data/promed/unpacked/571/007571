The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today [3 Feb 2017] received notification from the National Health and Family Planning Commission that 57 additional human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9), including 9 deaths, were recorded from 16 to 29 Jan 2017. The CHP strongly urges the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.

The 45 male and 12 female patients, aged 26 to 84 years, had their onset from 4 to 29 Jan 2017. The cases were from Jiangsu (13 cases), Guangdong (10 cases), Zhejiang (8 cases), Hunan (7 cases), Jiangxi (7 cases), Anhui (6 cases), Fujian (4 cases) and one case each in Hubei and Sichuan. Among them, 32 reported exposure to poultry or poultry markets, while the source of infection of 21 cases was still under investigation.

"Since November 2016, the Mainland health authorities have already recorded 298 human H7N9 cases thus far. We would also like to remind the public that human H7N9 cases continue to occur in neighbouring Guangdong, and the positive percentage for H7 virus of environmental samples is substantial. We again urge the public to pay special attention to health risks of the places of visit," a spokesman for the CHP said.

"While local surveillance, prevention and control measures are in place, we will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments," the spokesman said.

As the H7N9 virus continues to be detected in animals and environments in the Mainland, additional human cases are expected in affected and possibly neighbouring areas. In view of the heavy trade and travel between the Mainland and Hong Kong, further sporadic imported human cases in Hong Kong every now and then are expected, especially in the coming few months.

[Based on the figures from the notification in update [1] and subsequent cases reported from other provinces, over 300 human cases of influenza A/H7N9 have been reported since November 2016 from China.

The surge in cases and the continuity with which they continue to be detected indicate that the virus is in circulation/endemic in poultry in numerous regions of China; they also indicate that there is a robust system for detection and confirmation of suspected cases through laboratory tests.

Further information and analysis of epidemiological factors associated with virus transmission and severe disease must be gathered to formulate guidelines for prevention and control. - Mod.UBA
