Dead geese in Brunswick prompt concern, testing
-----------------------------------------------
Bush Cooper, a retired federal agent, was on one of his usual 3-mile walks one
day last week in his neighborhood when he began noticing dead geese.
Cooper, who lives near several small ponds in Cypress Run subdivision, off Old
Cypress Mill Road on the northern edge of Brunswick, was used to seeing Canada
geese about this time of year. But not dead ones. Nearly a week later, geese
are still dying, and no one seems to know why.
On Tuesday, Tammy Bechtold, another subdivision resident, walked around the
pond behind her house and pointed to several dead geese and another that was
slowly dying. "It's really sad," she said. By mid-day Tuesday, Bechtold said
the toll of dead geese was up to 16. Another 21 were swimming in the pond
behind Bechtold's house; she guessed that it wouldn't be long before some of
them die, too.
David Mixon, a wildlife biologist with the Georgia Department of Natural
Resources Wildlife Resources Division, said he collected 4 of the dead birds
and delivered them to the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study, a
state-federal cooperative organization in Athens [Georgia, USA] that
specializes in wildlife disease. There, the birds will be tested to determine
the cause of death. But results won't be back until the end of this week or
sometime next week. Until then, Mixon said, "We're just keeping an eye on it."
The situation is particularly puzzling because there have been no dead fish
found in the ponds [Canada geese don't eat fish, they are herbivorous; however,
when fish die of botulism, wildfowl may be affected. - Mod.JW]. Cooper said
other species of birds, including ducks, that visit the ponds have also been
unaffected. The geese show no outward signs of trauma.

[This article doesn't give us much clue about the clinical signs, if any were
seen before these birds died. So speculation is inappropriate. We look forward
to the results of lab tests. - Mod.TG]
