At least 7 people have suffered 'severe poisoning' after eating or drinking at a German university, police have today [23 Aug 2021] revealed.

Officers say they fell sick after consuming food or drink at the Darmstadt Technical University, in Darmstadt, near the city of Frankfurt in central Germany.

Six of the 7 people have been taken to hospital, according to local reports. It is believed students and staff are among those who have fallen ill.

Police are urging anyone who feels unwell after eating or drinking at the university today to seek medical attention. A 'bluish discoloration' of the fingers and toes is one of the signs of poisoning, officers say.

They have urged those who feel unwell 'not to move' and to call the emergency services immediately.

Police say it is not yet clear what the poisonous substance is.

However, they say early investigations show 'several milk packs and water containers' have been 'mixed with a harmful substance.' The containers were apparently being stored in a tea room of the university's science department.

In a statement released on Twitter tonight [23 Aug 2021], local police said: 'So far, we know of 7 people who, after consuming various foods and beverages in the 'L201' building of the Technical University, have shown signs of poisoning, among other things.'

'We ask all people who ate or drank in building 'L201' today, feel unwell or have bluish discoloration of their extremities, to seek medical help immediately.' 'In the event of discoloration, urgent medical advice: Try not to move and call the emergency doctor immediately.'

Police say they are on-site with other emergency services and an investigation is underway. They say officers are sweeping through additional buildings on the campus to check for any other harmful substances.

Police spokesman Bernd Hochstädter told one German news agency a chemical analysis of the substance is underway. He said: 'Such analysis is usually not quick. It will take a while.' Police say a result of the chemical analysis is not expected today [23 Aug 2021].

Commonly known as TU Darmstadt, the research university was founded more than 140 years ago, in 1877.

It was the 1st university in the world to set up a faculty for electrical engineering -- then a relatively new field of research.

The university boasts 4 Nobel laureates and 3 Wolf Prize in physics laureates. The most recent Nobel laureate was physicist Peter Grünberg in 2007, for his work which ultimately brought about a breakthrough in gigabyte hard drive space.

The university has around 2500 staff and an annual budget of around €450 million [about USD 529 270 million].

[The task of searching buildings for a toxic substance could be quite daunting if there are no more clues than "'several milk packs and water containers' have been 'mixed with a harmful substance'." Please note, we are not told what the substance is or could be.

"Methemoglobinemia is a condition characterized by increased quantities of hemoglobin in which the iron of heme is oxidized to the ferric (Fe3+) form. Methemoglobin is useless as an oxygen carrier and thus causes a varying degree of cyanosis," a bluish color of the skin, especially the lips and fingers, and the individual usually has what is described as chocolate-brown colored blood.

"The condition may arise as a result of a genetic defect in red blood cell metabolism or hemoglobin structure, or it may be acquired following exposure to various oxidant drugs or toxins."

As methemoglobin levels increase, the symptoms become more serious. Some of these can include headache; shortness of breath; nausea; rapid heart rate; fatigue and lethargy; confusion or stupor.

Without treatment, methemoglobinemia can be fatal and is usually considered a medical emergency.

The 1st treatment is usually to provide intravenous drug methylene blue. This medication usually produces rapid results but it cannot be used on those with a congenital type of methemoglobinemia. Likewise, some people do not respond to this treatment and will require a blood transfusion.

"Methemoglobinemia may be acute or chronic. The physiologic level of methemoglobin in the blood is 0% to 2%. Methemoglobin concentrations of 10% to 20% are tolerated well, but levels above this are often associated with symptoms. Levels above 70% may cause death. Symptoms also depend on the rapidity of its formation. Many patients with lifelong methemoglobinemia are asymptomatic, but patients exposed to drugs and toxins who abruptly develop the same levels of methemoglobinemia may be severely symptomatic.

"Blood containing high concentrations of methemoglobin appears chocolate brown. Subjects with methemoglobinemia may have normal partial pressures of oxygen, despite life-threatening methemoglobinemia. The oxygen saturation values, measured by a pulse oximeter, are falsely elevated.

"Outbreaks of methemoglobinemia have occurred due to nitrite poisoning from water contamination. [If the tea or milk packets were mixed with water containing high nitrites, this may mean the potential exposure area may be quite large or may be confined to the water in the bottles in the area where it occurred. - Mod.TG]

Several drugs or toxins can produce methemoglobinemia in individuals, including
- Acetanilid
- Alloxan
- Aniline
- Arsine
- Benzene derivatives
- Benzocaine
- Bivalent copper
- Bismuth subnitrate
- Bupivacaine hydrochloride
- Chlorates"

We hope no other individuals will suffer from this situation and for a speedy resolution of the problem. We wish any affected individuals a rapid recovery.
