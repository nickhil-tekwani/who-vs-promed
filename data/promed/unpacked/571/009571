The Health Commission of Horinger County in Inner Mongolia's Hohhot [prefecture] confirmed the local occurrence of one case of cutaneous anthrax. The patient's condition is stable. Reports say that on 25 Aug [2020], a health station in Xindianzi Township of Horinger County reported a suspected case of cutaneous anthrax.

Reports say that the patient is a villager in Xindianzi Township. At 9:30 a.m. on [25 Aug 2020], the patient sought treatment at Xindianzi Health Station. Following physical examination and patient history, the health station preliminarily diagnosed suspected cutaneous anthrax and immediately reported to relevant agencies and reported on the web within the time limit. Later, the patient was confirmed to have cutaneous anthrax.

Reports say that the patient raises sheep, 4 of which died in succession. The patient and 2 other villagers skinned them together, eating some of the mutton with family. The rest of the mutton and live sheep were treated by the agriculture and animal husbandry department.

[Our thanks to Dan Silver for this report and his translation.

Frequently, anthrax in sheep is missed until many animals have died, as opposed to bovine anthrax, which is reported from the 1st sudden death. It is fortunate that the authorities moved promptly in this case, presumably when the hospital reported this singular cutaneous case and before the 2-3 other carcasses reached the local markets. It is proper to make sure that the patient's remaining livestock and those in the village are checked and vaccinated. It is also wise to check animals in nearby villages as owners do not always observe and report deaths.

Horinger County is in central Inner Mongolia. For details and a map go to <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horinger_County.
