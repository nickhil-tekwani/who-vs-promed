2003/068 New finding of _Erwinia amylovora_ in Slovenia
---------------------------------------------
The Slovenian NPPO recently informed the EPPO Secretariat of a new finding
that _Erwinia amylovora_ [Ea], the bacterium that causes fireblight (EPPO
A2 quarantine pest), had been found in July 2001 on an old pear tree and 2
nearby trees. As all infected trees had been destroyed and no other finds
were made, the disease was provisionally considered as eradicated (see EPPO
RS 2001/120).

However, Ea was found again during a systematic survey in 2002 of private
gardens situated in the close vicinity of the infected area in the northern
part of Slovenia and subsequently confirmed on 20 May 2003.

The first new focus was found in the town Skofja Loka , located 13 km south
of the first finding in Naklo. The focus and 1-km buffer zone are
considered an infected area, where immediate destruction of all host plants
showing symptoms was ordered by burning infected plants at the orchard site
or in its nearest vicinity.

An intensive survey programme was imposed in a 5-km buffer zone, and all
host plants in a 10-km buffer zone are being monitored.

Despite strict measures taken in every focus, 73 new foci were reported
from 26 May to 18 June 2003. Blight forecasters issued 3-4 warnings in
early May. The outbreaks are considered as the result of blossom
infection. Stormy weather and the appearance of exudate enabled further
spread.

A map of the controlled area can be viewed on:

Surveys of other intensive plantations in Slovenia (in total: 2659 ha of
apple and 240 ha of pear) are still in process.

The situation of Ea in Slovenia can be described as follows: Present, found
in the northern part of Slovenia, under official control.

[Fireblight is a serious disease of apples, pears, and related trees and
shrubs in the family Rosaceae, sub-family Maloideae (pome fruits). It is
native to North America, was introduced to Europe in the 1950s, and has
spread throughout many countries in Europe and the Middle East. Disease
management involves use of sterilized cutting tools (alcohol or bleach),
pruning of all branches below the site of obvious infection (at least 30 to
60 cm, depending on branch diameter), burning of cut branches and, in the
case of severe disease, removal and burning of infected trees and use of
recommended bactericides. - Mod.DH]
