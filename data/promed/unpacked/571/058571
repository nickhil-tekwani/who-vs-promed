Q fever epidemic in the Chamonix Valley
---------------------------------------
An epidemic of Q fever has arisen in the Chamonix Valley. [By 30 Aug 2002],
there were 79 [clinical] cases of Q fever in residents of or visitors to
the Chamonix Valley. 22 cases have been confirmed, most of whom live in the
village of Chamonix.
Q fever is an infectious disease caused by _Coxiella burnetii_; a bacterium
that generally infects ruminants (cattle, sheep, and goats). Humans are
usually infected via inhalation of dust or aerosols containing the
responsible organism. The investigations conducted by sanitary authorities
in collaboration with health professionals of the Valley [Chamonix]
coordinating with the agricultural services have not identified the source
of this epidemic as yet. Q fever is not transmitted from person to person.
In the majority of cases, the infection is sub-clinical. When illness
presents it is after an incubation period of an average of 2 weeks, and
presents as a flu-like syndrome associated with a high fever, chills,
headaches, nausea, and aches. The illness usually resolves after 7 to 10
days, often without specific treatment.
In people with valvular heart disease or other serious disease associated
with impaired immunity Q fever can evolve into a chronic disorder. Such
people, when infected, require medical follow-up and prolonged antibiotic
treatment. Infection can lead to spontaneous abortion in pwomen in the
early months of pregnancy.
People who live in or have visited the Chamonix Valley since June 2002 may
have been exposed to the risk of infection. People who belong to identified
risk groups (valvular heart disease, immunocompromise, pregnant) are
recommended to consult their physicians for testing to identify if
antibiotic therapy is indicated.

Q fever, human - France
-----------------------
PARIS: At least 22 people in the French Alps have been infected by Q fever,
a flu-like illness that usually affects livestock, French health officials
said on Friday. Nearly 80 cases were suspected.
The outbreak was detected in the Chamonix valley, a popular ski area, the
Health Ministry said. Most of the confirmed cases are residents of the town
of Chamonix.
Q fever, which causes aches, nausea, and fever, can be treated and cured
with antibiotics. It primarily infects cattle, sheep, and goats. Humans
contract it by breathing in contaminated dust or eating contaminated animal
products. It does not spread from person to person.
The Foreign Ministry has asked the region's pregnant women, people with
heart valve problems, and those with weakened immune systems to consult
their doctors for a blood test. Those vulnerable may become chronic cases,
and pregnant women may risk losing their babies.

[Q fever is caused by the bacterium _Coxiella burnetii_. Cattle, sheep,
and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_. Infection has been
noted in a wide variety of other animals, including other breeds of
livestock and domesticated pets. _Coxiella burnetii_ does not usually
cause clinical disease in these animals, although abortion in goats and
sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_ infection. Organisms are excreted
in milk, urine, and feces of infected animals. Most importantly, during
birthing the organisms are shed in large numbers within the amniotic fluid
and the placenta. The organisms are resistant to heat, drying, and many
common disinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for
long periods in the environment. Infection of humans usually occurs by
inhalation of these organisms from air that contains airborne barnyard dust
contaminated by dried placental material, birth fluids, and excreta of
infected herd animals. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease,
and very few organisms may be required to cause infection
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/qfever/index.htm>.
GIDEON (<http://www.cyinfo.com/> offers the following background on the
epidemiology of Q fever in France:
Most cases occur in the south. Sixty-two per cent of cases present as
hepatitis. Five to 8 per cent of endocarditis in this region are due to Q
fever and 0.57 per cent of the population were seropositive in 1985. Among
pregnant women in southern France 0.15 per cent were seropositive in 1996.
289 cases were confirmed in the Bouches-du-Rhone district (southern France)
during 1990 to 1995 (regional rate 35.4/100 000). An outbreak of 29 cases
reported in Briancon (French Alps region) in 1996 was ascribed to ingestion
of raw meat.
Outbreaks of Q fever in France have also been associated with bird
droppings (1), sheep and wind (2), and ingestion of raw goat milk products (3).
The source of the current outbreak is unknown at present. It is interesting
that an outbreak in the French Alps in 1996 was related to ingestion of raw
meat. More information on this outbreak when available would be appreciated.
