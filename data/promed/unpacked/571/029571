A suspected anthrax case was detected in Jammayyapeta village of
Bhogapuram mandal in Vizianagaram district on Wednesday [5 Sep 2007].
A doctor from Tagarapuvalasa in Visakhapatnam district, NL Rao,
claimed that a shepherd's son, (age15), has been suffering from
anthrax for 5 days.
The case was clinically confirmed; however, [laboratory] confirmation
is yet to be done. [The patient] was diagnosed for anthrax when he
came to Rao for treatment. He was referred to King George Hospital in
Visakhapatnam. Rao also claimed to have detected 8-10 anthrax cases
during the past 10 years.

[There is nothing extraordinary about this report, but it is a ProMED
1st for Andra Pradesh apparently. I have known Dr NL Rao for some
time now and if he thinks it may be anthrax, it probably is.
Logically the boy would have been infected as a result of skinning a
sheep dead of this disease. We await news of confirmation. The
disease clusters along the eastern states of India. - Mod.MHJ]
