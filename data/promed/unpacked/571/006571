Schmallenberg virus identified in sheep in the northeast of France

-----------------------------------------------------
The presence of SBV has been confirmed in lambs on 13 farms in 6 departments of the North of France (departments No 52 [Haute Marne], 54 [Meurthe et Moselle], 57 [Moselle], 62 [Pas de Calais], 76 [Seine Maritime], 80 [Somme]). [For an interactive map of France showing all departments, see
http://www.cartesfrance.fr/carte-france-departement/carte-france-departements.html].

At the onset of SBV in Europe, DGAL (France's Animal Health and Welfare Protection) set in motion a surveillance, through the national platform for animal health epidemiological surveillance, to detect the earliest possible arrival of the disease in France. Sick animals on affected farms were reported by the practitioners to the departmental services. The Animal Health Laboratory at Maisons-Alfort acquired the ability to carry out SBV diagnosis.

Upcoming negotiations concerning the massive outbreak of a new animal disease caused by the Schmallenberg virus [SBV]
-----------------------------------------------------
As previously reported, numerous outbreaks of a previously unknown disease, caused by a a virus named Schmallenberg after the German city where it was first revealed in August 2011, have been reported from several countries in Western Europe.

Epizootic investigation revealed that the virus, which affects sheep, goats and cattle, is spread by blood-sucking insects. [The description of the disease, already known to our subscribers, is omitted].

A reliable and simple serological test for the disease is not yet available in the scientific centers of Europe and efforts for its development have been undertaken. Development of a vaccine to combat the disease may take, according to experts, up to 2 years. According to the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the risk for humans by the SBV can not be totally excluded, though hitherto known viruses that are genetically similar to SBV have not been found to pose risk to human health.

To date, SBV has been detected on livestock farms located throughout the Netherlands, in Belgium, Germany, 4 British farms in the counties of Norfolk, Suffolk and Sussex in the East of England, as well as on several farms in the French province of Lorraine.

Earlier there were reports of restrictive measures taken by Rosselkhoznadzor in mid-January to prevent the introduction of SBV with live animals or animal products to Russia / Customs Union.

To discuss the situation with the competent services of the European Commission and European countries affected by the disease, on Monday, 30 Jan 2012, a meeting will be held in Moscow between Rosselkhoznadzor and the delegations of the Directorate General of European Commission on food safety (DG SANCO), and the directorates of the Dutch, Belgian, German and UK Veterinary Services and the representative of France.

[4] SBV name dispute
Date: Sat, 28 Jan 2012

http://www.agd.nl/Artikel/580079/Schmallenberg-wil-nieuwe-naam-voor-virus.htm?nb=agd&editie=28%20januari%202012&link=Schmallenberg%20wil%20nieuwe%20naam%20voor%20virus&WT.mc_id=mail_agd_28%20januari%202012

The virus that is circulating in sheep, goats and cattle, is named after the German town Schmallenberg where the virus was first detected. The ski resort is far from being happy about the name given to the virus; the residents want to get the virus renamed.

"The offense is great," said a spokesman for the city on Saturday [28 Jan 2012] There is therefore a request to the German Friedrich Loffler Institute (FLI) for the name to be modified. According to the institute, it is common for a virus to be named after the location where it was first detected [an example is the Akabane virus, after the t location in Japan where it was initially isolated].
