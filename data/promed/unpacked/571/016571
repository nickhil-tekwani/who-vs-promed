Man hospitalized with bird flu symptoms in Kazakhstan
-----------------------------------------------
A 20-year-old man showing bird flu symptoms has been hospitalized in
Kazakhstan's Pavlodar region, where 600 domestic geese died between 20-30
Jul 2005 as a result of an outbreak of the disease in the area.
The patient, a poultry farm worker from the village of Golubovka, was later
diagnosed with double pneumonia and taken to the intensive care unit of
Pavlodar's regional infectious diseases hospital in critical condition,
sources in the region's emergency medicine center told Interfax.
"All birds that might have contracted the disease from the infected geese
have already been slaughtered, and the poultry farm has been disinfected.
Virus samples have been sent to Kazakhstan's National Veterinary Center in
Astana to establish a final diagnosis," Emergency Situations Ministry
sources told Interfax.
The 1st deaths of birds in Golubovka were registered a week [4th week July
2005] ago, Yersain Aitzhanov, chief of the Irtysh district's emergency
situations department, told Interfax. A quarantine order has been imposed
in the village. "All necessary measures are being taken: the territory is
being ploughed, additional fences have been built around the farm, and a
ban has been introduced on the delivery of poultry products and eggs from
the village," Aitzhanov said.

[Pavlodar is situated in north-eastern Kazachstan, bordering south-western
Siberia, a region where, currently, an outbreak of H5N1 is strongly
suspected. The affected village Golubovka, in Pavlodar, is on the river
Irtysh. This and other major rivers in eastern Kazakhstan run northwest
into Siberia.
From an unofficial source in the vicinity of Golubovka, we have been
informed that 300 ducks and geese died there by Fri 29 Jul 2005, while
diagnosis was pending. An official confirmation or otherwise will be
appreciated. - Mod.AS]
[If confirmed, this will signal a dramatic extension of the range of avian
influenza virus capable of infecting humans. All previous human cases of
avian influenza have been reported from East and South Asia -- Cambodia,
Indonesia, Thailand and Viet Nam -- countries remote from the Pavlodar
region of Kazakhstan. - Mod.CP]
