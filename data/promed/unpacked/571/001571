INFECTION CONTROL - SWEDEN
==========================
Date: Thu, 6 Jun 1996 12:06:18 +0200
From: ulrika@mb.ks.se (Ulrika Ransjv)

I am chief of the Infection Control team (1 full time physician, 3 ICP's, 2
laboratory technicians) at Karolinska Hospital, one of Sweden's seven
university hospitals, and responsible for about 3000 hospital beds here and
at affiliated hospitals. Have subscribed to ProMED for 3 months and find it
fun but rather rich - my POP server gets full if I don't fetch the mail
daily ...
In Sweden, as in the other Scandinavian countries, MRSA are less than 1% of
the _S. aureus_ isolates; and nearly all cases are imported from other parts
of the world. Maybe the MRSA problem has got out of hand in some parts of
some countries, but those of us that are still in this favourable position
certainly should try to maintain MRSA control, since the therapy available
is so much simpler for MSSA and we fear the problems associated with
vancomycin overuse.

Our national policy is to culture every patient coming from hospital care
abroad: nose, wound, groin, and particularly ask for MRSA on the lab request.
Awaiting results, the patient is nursed in a one-patient room, and staff
wear a protective gown and gloves at close patient contact. If cultures are
positive for MRSA, this policy is continued as long as the patient has open
wounds and remains in a ward where other patients have wounds. This policy
has proved successful even in ICUs and in burns units, and we believe it to
be cost effective.

We do not attempt to find or eradicate nasal carriage of MRSA in staff, as
we firmly believe that the nose is just an excellent air sampler detecting
the presence of a person that disperses MRSA to the air (which can be
detected more easily by using settle plates), but that the nose is not a
source of the organism. No studies published have to my knowledge shown that
treating nasal MRSA carriage in staff has had any effect whatsoever on an
epidemic situation.
