99/171 First report of lime witches' broom phytoplasma in India
Acid lime (_Citrus aurantifolia_) is one of the most important citrus crops
in India (20% of total citrus production). In 1995, unusual symptoms of
witches' broom, leaf fall and branch dieback were observed on a 6-year old
_C. aurantifolia_ in eastern Maharashtra. Surveys carried out from 1995 to
1998 revealed that disease incidence reached 5 % in Maharashtra and other
major lime-growing states: Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.
Phytoplasmas were constantly observed in diseased plants. This is the first
report of lime witches' broom phytoplasma (EU Annexes) in India.
