In the Kagera region in northwestern Tanzania, almost 700 deaths have
occurred since July of last year from a disease first reported as malaria
but now suspected to be something other. The disease, unlike classic
malaria, kills within two days. Currently, 20 to 30 persons are dying each
day, with many deaths going unrecorded in outlying villages. The actual
death toll may be as high as 1,00.
A mission led by Health Minister Aaron Chiduo is now in the region to probe
the mysterious fever, thought by many to be Rift Valley Fever, which was
recently reported present in the Kenya border region of Arusha.
