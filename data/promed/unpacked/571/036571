Fresh suspected cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) have surfaced in the city of Jamshedpur [Jharkhand Indian state].

District officer for Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), Sahir Pall said they got 2 blood samples of suspected Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases, which were sent to the microbiology department of MGM Medical College in Dimna. "We got the samples from a local hospital which has been sent to the lab for a test. The report is expected in the next 72-hours," he said.

JE [virus] is spread through mosquito bites. Symptoms usually take 5-15 days to develop and include fever, headache, vomiting, confusion, and difficulty in moving. JE is a serious disease that may cause death.

[Little clinical data relating to these 2 cases is provided, nor is any information given about the circumstances under which they became infected. Although avoidance of mosquito bites as recommended in the full report above is prudent, vaccination is the best protective measure. The virus is endemic in north western India with birds as reservoir hosts and pigs as amplifiers. The _Culex_ mosquito vectors can become very abundant seasonally, breeding in wetlands. Vector control is difficult. - Mod.TY
