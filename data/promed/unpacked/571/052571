Some thoughts from a veterinary ophthalmologist colleague of mine:
Given the information provided, my rule-outs would be as follows:
- viral number one (because of the recurrent nature),
- bacterial (to include _Chlamydia_ spp. and _Mycoplasma_ spp.) second,
- immune mediated a distant third.
Mind you, some viral and bacterial diseases involve a significant immune
component.
Diagnostics: if it hasn't been done, tear production must be evaluated. It
wouldn't necessarily fit, but I suppose dry eye could be an issue. The only
other reasonable diagnostics that could be done would be corneal scraping
for cytology (include an Acid Fast stain; these organisms have been
implicated in equine keratitis) and possibly corneal biopsy. Heaven knows
how one would do these tests on an elephant.
Nothing is mentioned on how these animals were treated, if at all, so I'll
offer some thoughts. In spite of my thinking itÂ´s most likely to be viral,
I would initiate therapy with antibiotics, topical for sure and systemic if
safe to do so (don't know enough about elephants to know if this is the
case). The reason for this is that antibiotic therapy is safer (less side
effects), easier (anti-viral needs to be given topically quite frequently),
and more reliable (results should be seen within a few days, as opposed to
anti-viral which could take weeks) than anti-viral therapy. Chlamydia in
cats is best treated with both topical and oral doxycycline, the latter
being necessary for about 3 weeks.
Depending on response or lack thereof, start topical anti-virals. I'm not
familiar at all with any systemic anti-virals for elephants. Lastly,
EXTREMELY judicious use of steroids might be necessary even if the keratitis
is primarily due to either virus or bacteria.
A last thought; in cats, which seem to get conjunctivitis/keratitis which is
very difficult to diagnose and treat, systemic disease must be considered.
Herpevirus definitely causes ocular signs in many species (I assume
elephants also) and its activity is worsened by "stress". Stress could be
caused by concurrent disease of any type, poor husbandry, fighting between
individuals, etc etc.
Hope this helps. I've basically summarized the manner in which we approach
keratoconjunctivitis in the cat. Difficult disease to deal with, to be sure.
