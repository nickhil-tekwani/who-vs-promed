The Department of Health is warning Western Australians of the
potential health risks of getting a tattoo in Bali, following
confirmation of a WA case of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)
infection where all the evidence points to a tattoo received recently
in Bali as being the source of the infection.

Department of Health Communicable Disease Control Director Dr Paul
Armstrong said getting body art and piercings done overseas,
particularly in developing countries, was not recommended.

"While tattooists in Western Australia must comply with strict
regulations and a code of practice, tattoo parlours overseas may not
meet the same standards," Dr Armstrong said. "This case demonstrates
the very real health risk in having this type of procedure done
overseas," he said. "Western Australians who have had a tattoo done in
Bali recently should consult their GP and consider the need for
testing for HIV and other blood-borne viruses.

"The equipment used in tattooing and body piercing, if contaminated
with infected blood, can pose a risk of transmission of blood-borne
viruses such as HIV, hepatitis B and C as well as bacterial
infections."

HIV is transmitted through blood-to-blood contact and sexual activity.
There is no vaccine or cure.

Indonesia is investigating the case of an Australian who is believed
to have been infected with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) while
getting a tattoo on the resort island of Bali, an official said Monday
[26 Dec 2011].

"We received a report about this case from the Health Ministry
yesterday [25 Dec 2011], and officials will be visiting tattoo
parlours today to verify this claim," Bali health department chief
Nyoman Sutedja told AFP. "At this point, we are still investigating.
We can't say for sure if the patient caught the virus from getting a
tattoo or sexual contact," he added.

There are currently 4200 HIV/AIDS cases on Bali, Sutedja said.

Australian health authorities on Friday [23 Dec 2011] said a patient
diagnosed with HIV probably contracted the virus while being tattooed
on the island. They did not reveal any details of the individual
concerned.

More than a million tourists visit Bali every year to enjoy its white
surf beaches, nightlife and Hindu culture.

Indonesian officials said last year [2010] that the number of known
HIV/AIDS cases on Bali was soaring, with one in 4 prostitutes reported
to be HIV-positive and the number of infections jumping almost 19
percent from the year before.

[Tattoos breach the skin, which means that skin infections and other
complications are possible. Specific risks include:
- Allergic reactions. Tattoo dyes -- especially red dye -- can cause
allergic skin reactions, resulting in an itchy rash at the tattoo
site. This may occur even years after you get the tattoo.
- Skin infections. Tattoos can lead to local bacterial infections,
characterized by redness, swelling, pain and a pus-like drainage.
- Other skin problems. Sometimes granulomas form around tattoo ink,
especially red ink. Tattooing can also lead to raised areas caused by
an overgrowth of scar tissue (keloids).
- Bloodborne diseases. If the equipment used to create the tattoo is
contaminated with infected blood, blood-borne diseases can be
contracted, including hepatitis B & C, tetanus and HIV, leading
ultimately to AIDS.
- MRI complications. Rarely, tattoos or permanent makeup may cause
swelling or burning in the affected areas during magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) examinations. In some cases -- such as when a person
with permanent eyeliner has an MRI of the eye -- tattoo pigments may
interfere with the quality of the image.

Unfortunately, tattoo inks are classified as cosmetics, so they are
not regulated or approved by the United States Food and Drug
Administration (FDA); (From: Mayo Clinic data 1998
http://www.mayoclinic.com/print/tattoos-and-piercings/MC00020/METHOD=print).

Further information is awaited concerning the specific mode of
transmission of HIV in the Bali tattooing incident, the use of
unsterilised needles being a very probable route. - Mod.CP
