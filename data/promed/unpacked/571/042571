Outbreak of salmonella infections linked to Gravel Ridge Farms shell eggs
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Since the last update on [10 Sep 2018], 24 ill people have been added to this investigation.

As of 1 Oct 2018, 38 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis have been reported from 7 states.

State / Ill people
------------------
Alabama / 7
Colorado / 1
Iowa / 1
Kentucky / 1
Ohio / 4
Montana / 1
Tennessee / 23
Total / 38

Illnesses started on dates ranging from [17 Jun 2018] to [16 Aug 2018]. Ill people range in age from 1 year to 94, with a median age of 33. As many as 57% of ill people are female. Of 32 people with information available, 10 (31%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Illnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks.

Outbreak investigation
----------------------
State and local health officials continue to interview ill people and ask questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. 22 of 29 (76%) people interviewed reported eating restaurant dishes made with eggs. This percentage is significantly higher than results from a survey of healthy people in which 38% of respondents reported eating any eggs away from home in the week before they were interviewed. These restaurants reported using shell eggs in the dishes eaten by ill people.

FDA and state partners traced the source of the shell eggs supplied to these restaurants. Gravel Ridge Farms in Cullman, Alabama supplied shell eggs to restaurants where 19 of the 22 ill people ate. 8 ill people live in states where Gravel Ridge Farms shell eggs were not sold. 6 of these ill people traveled to states where Gravel Ridge Farms shell eggs were sold.

The outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Enteritidis was identified in environmental samples from Gravel Ridge Farms. Officials in Alabama also collected eggs from the Gravel Ridge Farms facility for testing. The outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Enteritidis was identified in these eggs.

WGS [whole genome sequencing ] results show that the salmonella from the environmental samples and from Gravel Ridge Farms is closely related genetically to the salmonella from ill people. These results provide more evidence that people in this outbreak got sick from eating shell eggs from Gravel Ridge Farms.

On [8 Sep 2018], Gravel Ridge Farms recalled cage-free large eggs because they might be contaminated with salmonella bacteria. This investigation is ongoing, and CDC will provide updates when more information is available.

[Salmonellosis is often thought to be associated with cracked eggs or eggs dirty with fecal matter, a problem controlled by cleaning procedures implemented in the egg industry. It is clearly the case, however, that most of the salmonellosis outbreaks linked to eggs were associated with uncracked, disinfected grade A eggs, or foods containing such eggs. The undamaged eggs become contaminated during ovulation, and thus were contaminated with the bacteria before the egg shell was formed. To avoid this, uncooked eggs should only be used as an ingredient, if pasteurized. - Mod.LL
