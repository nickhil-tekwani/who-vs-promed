The minister of health and sports, Jeyson Auza, reported this Monday [21 Nov 2022] that 6 people suffering from whooping cough were discharged and that 21 cases are still active. "To date, there are 27 cases of whooping cough nationwide, of which 19 are under 5 years of age and 8 are over 5 years of age.

Whooping cough, also known as [pertussis], is a highly contagious respiratory illness caused by a type of bacteria called _Bordetella pertussis_. Whooping cough bacteria attach to the cilia (small hair-like extensions) that line part of the upper respiratory tract. These bacteria release toxins (poisons) that damage the cilia and cause inflammation of the airways.

It is a very risky situation for the health of the Bolivian people, especially for children under 5 who have not received their pentavalent vaccine, the minister said. He warned that this disease is almost twice as transmissible as the most contagious strains of COVID-19 and may be fatal in children.

In epidemiological week 44 [30 Oct-5 Nov 2022], the Ministry of Health reported that 4 cases of whooping cough were registered and all were in Santa Cruz; in report 45 [6-12 Nov 2022], the figure increased to a global of 20. In the report for epidemiological week 46 [13-19 Nov 2022], the indicator climbed to 27 cases, that is, an additional 7, 25 of which are in Santa Cruz, 1 in El Alto (La Paz), and 1 in Oruro.

To contain the outbreak, the Ministry of Health declared an epidemiological alert at the beginning of the month [November 2022]. The measure included a massive tracking and vaccination plan. Over the weekend [19-20 Nov 2022], in El Alto, where a case was registered, 1000 brigades with 2000 professionals were mobilized to tour the city to vaccinate children under 5 and find possible suspects for an "immunological barrier" and prevent the spread of the disease, explained the minister.

Auza assured that the vaccine, doctors, and diagnostic tests are guaranteed in all departments to combat the disease and prevent its spread. The vaccine, aimed at children under 5 years of age, is the pentavalent vaccine that protects them against 5 diseases: diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, hepatitis B, pneumonia, and meningitis.

The mobilization of the brigades in El Alto was activated with the coordination of the Ministry of Health and the Departmental Health Services of La Paz and Regional of El Alto. This same action took place in Santa Cruz.

[The city of Santa Cruz (population almost 1.9 million residents), where most pertussis cases (25) are occurring, is Bolivia's largest city and capital of Santa Cruz Department, located in the eastern part of the country (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Cruz_de_la_Sierra). El Alto (population about 1 million), with 1 pertussis case, is Bolivia's second-largest city in Bolivia, located adjacent to Bolivia's capital city La Paz in La Paz Department, in the western part of the country (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Alto). Oruro (population about 350 000), with 1 pertussis case, is the capital city of Oruro Department, located south of La Paz Department (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oruro). A map showing the departments of Bolivia can be found at https://www.mappr.co/counties/bolivia/#pgcSgb-sl-0_5614.

When a large proportion of the population is immunized, even those who are unvaccinated can benefit from a lower risk of exposure to the pathogen, as a consequence of herd immunity. The spread of disease from person to person becomes unlikely when herd immunity is achieved. The percentage of the population needed to be immune to achieve herd immunity varies from disease to disease. The more contagious the pathogen, the greater the proportion of the population that needs to be immune to the disease to stop its transmission. For example, measles is caused by a highly contagious virus. It's estimated that at least 95% of the population must be immune to interrupt the chain of transmission of measles. The vaccination coverage rate required to provide adequate pertussis protection for the whole population is said to be 92-94% (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1753-6405.12732.

In the US, DTaP, and Tdap vaccines are used for pertussis immunization (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/dtap-tdap-td/hcp/recommendations.html). (upper-case letters in these abbreviations denote full-strength doses of diphtheria (D) and tetanus (T) toxoids and pertussis (P) vaccine. Lowercase "d" and "p" denote reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis used in the adolescent/adult formulations of the vaccine. The "a" in DTaP and Tdap stands for "acellular," meaning that the pertussis component contains only a part of the pertussis organism.)

In the US, DTaP is given to children younger than 7 years of age, and Tdap is given to older children and adults. Children should get 5 doses of DTaP, one dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15 through 18 months, and 4 through 6 years. Adolescents 11 through 18 years of age (preferably at age 11-12 years) should receive a single dose of Tdap. One dose of Tdap is also recommended for adults 19 years of age and older who did not get Tdap as an adolescent. Tdap should also be given to 7-10 year-olds who are not fully immunized against pertussis.

Bolivia reportedly uses DTwP, w standing for whole pertussis bacterial cell, combined with _Haemophilus influenzae_ B and hepatitis B vaccine given at 2, 4, and 6 months of age (https://immunizationdata.who.int/pages/schedule-by-country/bol.html).

Expectant mothers should receive the Tdap vaccine during each pregnancy, preferably at 27 through 36 weeks, because maternal antibodies are acquired by the fetus following maternal vaccination during this time. - Mod.ML
