I read with interest the story of bats with cleft palates. Could they have
other malformations in the brain? I believe it is very suggestive of a
virus infection -- type bluetonguevirus -- that gave the whole book of
pathology of malformations of the skull and CNS. It is also in Australia if
I remember rightly.

NSW Ag could test for neutralising antibodies to Menangle virus in affected
and unaffected animals to assist the investigation of this problem. Virus
isolation could be attempted but some funding may be necessary.
Menangle virus in pigs is a neurotrophic teratogenic paramyxovirus. We know
it is found in flying foxes but do not know what it does.

The cleft palates in bats may be related to pesticide toxicity. I came
across the following discussion about pesticides and cleft palate occurences:
<http://www.chem-tox.com>
Hydrocephaly & Cleft Palete Birth Defects Occur After Pesticide Exposure
Of the many different types of pesticides (which include insecticides,
herbicides and fungicides), it was found that the common fungicide
"cyproconazole" caused serious defects when administered to test animals.
This chemical is reported to be widely used in agriculture and is a member
of the family of fungicides known as triazole fungicides. Its closely
related family members include the fungicides triadimefon, triadimenol,
bitertanol, flusilazole, 1,2,4-triazole, and propiconazole. Each of these
pesticides were reported in this article as being capable of causing birth
defects in test animals when administered at doses as low as 30 mg/kg.
These chemicals are far more toxic than even standard insecticides. The "No
Observable Effect Level" (which means the maximum amount of the chemical
that test animals can be exposed to without seeing any adverse effects) is
reported to be only 2 mg/kg for flusilazole.
The study on the effects of cyproconazole (lets call it CPZ for simplicity)
was headed by Dr. K. Machera, at the Laboratory of Pesticide Toxicology in
Athens, Greece. Dr. Machera exposed 10 pregnant animals to different levels
of CPZ ranging from 20-75 mg/kg from the 6th to the 16th day of pregnancy.
On the 21st day of pregnancy the animals were sacrificed and the number of
implantations, resorption sites and live and dead fetuses were recorded.
The fetuses were weighed and examined for abnormalities.
Results showed the number of resorptions (similar to an early miscarriage)
was over 8 times greater for the animals exposed to the 50 and 75 mg/kg
doses. The fetal length was significantly smaller in doses from 50 mg/kg
up. The fetal body weight was significantly less even at the lowest dose of
20 mg/kg.
Cleft Palate did not occur in any of the 100 offspring not exposed to CPZ.
However, cleft palate did occur in 2% of animals exposed to 20 mg/kg of
CPZ, 20% of animals exposed to 50 mg/kg of CPZ and 91% of animals exposed
to the highest 100 mg/kg dose.
The same trend was also seen with hydrocephalus - 0% for the animals not
exposed to CPZ, 6% for animals exposed to 20 mg/kg, 19% for animals exposed
to 50 mg/kg, 32% for animals exposed to 75 mg/kg and 100% for the 12
animals exposed to the 100 mg/kg level.
These studies demonstrate the definite potential for pesticides in the
triazole family to increase the risk of lower birth weight, lower body
length, as well as strongly increasing the risk of cleft palate and
hydrocephalus. With results such as this in test animals, it would
certainly be worthwhile to investigate the incidence of these conditions
among people living in close proximity to agricultural areas. Dr. Machera
did not state if these chemicals were used on residential lawns as an
anti-fungal agent. Keep in mind that these studies were looking for
physical defects and were not looking for neurological defects in offspring
(which typically occur at much lower dosages).
