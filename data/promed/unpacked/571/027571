The recent ProMED-mail report on brucellosis in Kyrgyzstan (2 Jan 2009)
[archive no. 20090102.0010] appears to be somewhat misleading, outdated,
and incomplete. The government of Kyrgyzstan is well aware of the
brucellosis situation in animals and humans and is treating this as an
urgent national issue.

A national control program for brucellosis has been set in motion with
multi-donor assistance from the World Bank, the Swiss Development
Cooperation (SDC), the EU, the Swedish International Development Agency,
and others. Kyrgyzstan is recognized as a country having one of the highest
rates of brucellosis in animals and humans. Naryn has been the focus for
much of the surveys and initial pilot work. Based on the results of the
initial survey work, the Government has instituted a national vaccination
program in 2008 to control the disease at source in the livestock
population. This has been combined with a public awareness campaign to
improve personal hygiene and prevent human exposure through direct contact
(that is, during lambing, care after animals) or consumption of
contaminated food products.

It is likely that the 10 per cent incidence of brucellosis reported in
humans in the province of Naryn, and refuted by the Ministry of Health,
actually refers to a 10 per cent Rose Bengal test [RBT] seroprevalence
found in small ruminants in a recent randomized survey of animals in 13
villages in Ak-Talaa, a district in Naryn. A seroprevalence of 1.7 per cent
was found in cattle. The final seroprevalence will depend on results of
indirect ELISAs [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay] on all RBT reactors.

Brucellosis in humans in Naryn province during 11 months of 2-8 [?2008]
appeared to be 151.3 per 100 000 population [from] recently conducted
[studies] in the high risk area of Naryn [that is, the incidence of
brucellosis in Naryn is actually about 0.15 per cent instead of 10 per cent
indicated in the ProMED-mail report]; the incidence of brucellosis in
humans has been stabilized and is reduced.

The Government of Kyrgyzstan takes this situation very seriously, is
committed to a long term strategy for reducing the incidence of brucellosis
in animals and humans, and has moved to a risk-based approach. This
includes high-coverage vaccination of small ruminants, control programs for
cattle, awareness campaigns, and public involvement at the village level.
In fact, the brucellosis program has evolved from donor supported projects
for community and village health and also bird flu control and is an
important part of the comprehensive approach to "One Health". This effort
is coordinated through the deputy prime minister and with uniquely close
cooperation between the MAWRPI [Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources
and Processing Industry] and the Ministry of Health for the control of
zoonotic diseases. The program is also consistent with the Government's
very close collaboration with the OIE [World Organisation for Animal
Health] in upgrading its veterinary services to meet international
standards in accordance with its WTO [World Trade Organisation] commitments.

It should also be recognized that this work is being carried out during a
very difficult period of fiscal crisis and with considerable limitations on
the national budget and resources.
