Date of start of the event: 24 Mar 2017
Date of confirmation of the event: 28 Mar 2017
Reason for notification: new strain of a listed disease in the country
Causal agent: foot-and-mouth disease virus
Serotype: A
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (2)

Outbreak 1: Boussena, Ouzna, Medea

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 2
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 16 / 5 / 0 / 0 / 16
Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 31.25 / 0 / 0 / 100
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology

Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: Prospection launching of the national vaccination campaign against serotype O of foot-and-mouth disease because of its presence in the region. Measures are being taken to face the occurrence of this new serotype (A) in the country (vaccines not available yet).

Control measures

Measures applied: movement control inside the country; disinfection / disinfestation; stamping out; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: vaccination in response to the outbreak(s).

Diagnostic test results

Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Central Veterinary Laboratory (National laboratory) / cattle / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 4 Apr 2017 / Positive
Central Veterinary Laboratory (National laboratory) / cattle / typing ELISA / 4 Apr 2017 / Positive

[As might have been expected, in the absence of vaccination, the introduced new serotype is spreading within the susceptible livestock population of northern Algeria, zoosanitary measures -- like animal movement restrictions -- not sufficient for its arrest. It has now been confirmed in the eastern provinces Medea and Bordj Bou Arreridj.

Genotyping, enabling the choice of a matching vaccine strain which may be sought in vaccine banks, is needed urgently. In 2014, when Algeria suffered an outbreak of FMDV-O, it took roughly a month between the collecting date of samples (10 Aug 2014) and the date of their receipt at the WRLFMD, Pirbright, UK (8 Sep 2014), where their genotyping was completed and results reported within 6 days (14 Sep 2014; see at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2014/WRLFMD-2014-00028%20O%20Algeria%202014.pdf.

According to the Algeria page of the WRLFMD, no samples from Algeria have been received there yet. Algeria's Central (national) Veterinary Laboratory reported its serotyping results on [Tue 28 Mar 2017]. Hopefully, samples to the WRLFMD have been submitted since. In the absence of information about the genotyping and consequently of a matching vaccine, Algeria may opt to apply a similar policy to the one applied recently in Israel and the Gaza strip (Palestinian authority, PA) where, facing an outbreak of an FMDV-O strain hitherto not genotyped, revaccinations and ring-vaccinations were applied with a broad-spectrum, multivalent FMD vaccine. The (inactivated, oil emulsion, commercially available) FMD vaccine applied there included, on top of 4 serotype O vaccine strains (O manisa, O-3039, O geshur 2/85, O-5911) also 2 serotype A vaccine strains which are known to match those circulating in the region: A-4165 ("A Saudi 95") and A-4135 ("A Iran 05"). In case a vaccine including these 2 strains is readily available, even if combined with other strains, the Algerian authorities may consider using it without delay, until genotyping is completed.

In the absence of any matching vaccine, eventually the production of a homologous vaccine will have to be considered. Morocco, Algeria's western neighbor, has been taking preparatory steps facing a possible penetration of the disease from its eastern border; see at http://www.promedmail.org/post/4948186. - Mod.AS
