Almost a month before the start of the hunting season on 1 Jul 2019, the Walloon government took a new decision to curb African swine fever [ASF] in the province of Luxembourg. The measures are intended to ensure a total depopulation of wild boar in the different zones defined within the perimeter infected by ASF, says Minister of Nature and Forest Rene Collin.

In the core and buffer zones the destruction of wild boar will be carried out by the agents of the government as well as by the holders of hunting rights benefiting from a derogation to the prohibition of hunting. In areas of enhanced observation and vigilance, the holders of hunting rights will have the obligation to organize on their territory as many destruction beats as necessary for each part of their territory. If the authorities record, as of 1 Nov 2019, unsatisfactory (low) results in a given territory, the local administrations could organize wild boar destruction by their own means.

Safety zones have been defined around the Etalle region in the province of Luxembourg since September 2018 following ASF introduction. Recreationalists were banned from the forests for months to avoid spreading the highly infectious and harmful virus in wild boars and domestic pigs. The forests were reopened on 6 Apr 2019, causing concern on the Flemish side. The peak of the epidemic may be over, but new cases are still being found [see comment].

People who want to walk or mountain bike in the 16 000-hectare [39 537 acre] area in the Gaume region can do so with a number of precautions. For example, they must adhere to the paths, they may not bring meat products for picnics, and are required to disinfect footwear and their mountain-bike tires at the termination of walks or bike ride.

The government's aim is to halve the population of wild boar in the entire Walloon territory by 2020.

[The report above includes a map of Belgium presenting the locations of all ASF-infected boars as well as those killed but which tested negative.

According to Belgium's weekly reports to the OIE, since the start of the ASF event affecting wild boars in the province Luxembourg on 9 Sep 2018, a total of 656 outbreaks (821 animals) have been reported, including 797 wild boar found dead and 24 "killed and disposed of." The disease peaked during the 6th week of 2019 [week of 4 Feb 2019], maintaining relatively high number of cases until the 15th week [week of 8 Apr 2019], when it started decreasing. The last weekly follow-up report (no 38, dated 11 Jun 2019) notified 6 new cases; see, with an interactive map showing their locations, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=30745. - Mod.AS
