[1] US (CA) ex S Africa: first detection of omicron variant
Date: Wed 1 Dec 2021

U.S. health officials on [Wed 1 Dec 2021] reported the country's first case of the omicron variant of the coronavirus, in a person in California.

The COVID-19 case was identified by the California and San Francisco health departments in a person who had traveled to South Africa and returned on [Mon 22 Nov 2021], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a release. The individual, who was fully vaccinated and had mild symptoms that are improving, has been isolating since testing positive on [Mon 29 Nov 2021]. All close contacts have been contacted and have tested negative thus far, health officials said. At a White House briefing, Anthony Fauci, the country's top infectious disease official, said to his knowledge, the person had not received a booster.

The finding of omicron in the United States is not a surprise. Upon characterizing the mutations in the variant, scientists in South Africa last week quickly raised the world's alarms about the potential threat it posed, but it had already started to circulate silently. Places from the United Kingdom to Australia to Israel to Hong Kong have already reported cases. This newly identified case is not necessarily the first one in the United States, just the first to be detected. Genomic sequencing was conducted at the University of California, San Francisco and the sequence was confirmed at CDC.

Omicron is bringing renewed attention to the problems and piecemeal nature of the U.S. surveillance network. The country's genetic sequencing infrastructure has grown during the pandemic, and at a briefing on [Tue 30 Nov], CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said that the number of positive tests being sequenced in the U.S. is now 80 000 samples per week, or between 5% and 10% of confirmed cases. That's up from the beginning of the year [2021] when the agency and its partners were sequencing just a few thousand samples per week. But progress has been uneven. Over the past 3 months, a number of states were sequencing and reporting just 3% of their confirmed infections.

California has a comparatively robust sequencing network, with some 12% of infections sequenced over the past 3 months.

Without stronger surveillance, it's difficult to know which iterations of the virus are out there.

On [Mon 29 Nov 2021], U.S. travel restrictions went into effect on South Africa and Botswana -- where early cases of omicron were identified -- and 6 other countries in the region. Many other countries have imposed their own travel restrictions, and some have halted international arrivals.

With a pathogen like the coronavirus, travel restrictions can slow, but not generally block, the arrival of new variants, research has shown.

Viruses generally follow travel patterns as they spread to new areas, and San Francisco is a major U.S. travel hub. But what happens next is subject to a lot of randomness. Many imported infections don't result in any other infections, but some set off new chains of transmission. The more imported cases, the higher the likelihood that some cause subsequent infections.

Scientists are racing to better understand the threat posed by omicron. Preliminary epidemiological evidence in South Africa suggests it may have a transmission advantage even over the highly transmissible delta variant, and its genome indicates it may be able to evade at least some immune protection. But it will take time for scientists to run the studies and gather the evidence that can confirms whether or not those concerns will be realized.

Even apart from omicron, the U.S. in recent weeks has seen a resurgence of spread, in states in the Mountain West, Midwest, and Northeast, driven largely by the highly transmissible delta variant, the arrival of colder temperatures, and pockets of unprotected people. According to the latest CDC data, more than 80 000 Americans are still being infected every day.

When asked how and if the arrival of omicron should change life for Americans, Fauci said the current strategies--vaccines, booster, and masking when appropriate--are sufficient. He said celebrating the upcoming holidays with vaccinated friends and family was still his plan, and he once again recommended all Americans ages 18 and older to receive a booster dose of vaccine if they have not done so yet.

"Get boosted now," Fauci said. The CDC says all adults who received an mRNA vaccine 6 or more months ago, and adults who received Johnson & Johnson 2 months ago, should be boosted.

The CDC COVID Data Tracker shows that 59.4% of Americans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 70.2% have received at least one dose of vaccine, and 20.9% of fully vaccinated Americans have received a booster dose.

Tomorrow [Thu 2 Dec 2021] President Joe Biden is expected to announce his winter plan for combatting the virus. Part of the plan is likely stricter testing requirements for all travelers entering the United States, including returning Americans, the Washington Post reports. Under the policy, everyone entering the country would need to be tested 1 day before boarding flights, regardless of vaccination status. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/11/30/omicron-stricter-travel-rules-us-entry/]

Vermont on [Tue 30 Nov 2021] reported its most hospitalizations from COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic, the Associated Press reports. A total of 84 people were hospitalized, with 22 in intensive care. Arkansas reported its biggest 1-day jump in cases since September [2021]. [https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-vermont-rutland-bennington-13d3002a8eb709fbe34f43a5658bcd1f]

The United States reported 116 588 new COVID-19 cases yesterday [Tue 30 Nov 2021] and 1539 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker. The 14-day average of new daily cases is 83 120, with 893 daily deaths, according to the New York Times tracker.

Weekly pediatric cases of COVID-19 continue to surpass 100 000, now for the 16th week in a row. Nearly 132 000 child COVID-19 cases were reported from [18 Nov to 25 Nov 2021], according to the latest update from the American Academy of Pediatrics. [https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/]

A survey of 500 American companies shows that 57% now require or will require COVID-19 vaccines for employees, and that vaccine requirements have resulted in resignations for just 3% of employers. The vast majority of employers (90%) said they require or plan to require masks to be worn indoors.

In related news, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced she is seeking an emergency court order to force Amazon to implement stricter COVID-19 protocols in its warehouses, CNBC reports. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/30/new-york-ag-amazon-dropped-covid-safety-protocols-in-warehouses.html]. "While case rates, hospitalizations, and deaths rise, Amazon rescinds protections and packs in more workers for its holiday rush," the filing reads.

There are indications that individuals fully vaccinated against corona within 6 months or with the booster are also protected against the omicron variant, Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz said on [Tue 30 Dec 2021], after another 2 cases were identified, bringing the total to 4.

"In the coming days we will have more accurate information about the efficacy of the vaccine against omicron, but there is already room for optimism, and there are initial indications that those who are vaccinated with a vaccine still valid or with a booster will also be protected from this variant," Horowitz said while visiting the Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba with Finance Minister Avigdor Liberman.

"The vaccine is really crucial right now," said Horowitz. "Anyone who is exposed to the variant without a vaccine will put themselves at unnecessary risk."

Later in the evening, a report by Channel 12 said the Pfizer vaccine is just slightly less effective in preventing infection with omicron than with delta - 90% as opposed to 95% - while it is as effective - around 93% - in preventing serious symptoms at least for those vaccinated with a booster.

According to the report, the ability of the variant to infect is higher than delta but not as much as feared - around 1.3 times higher. At the same time, those not inoculated have a 2.4 times greater chance of developing serious symptoms, a significant figure.

A spokesperson for the Health Ministry said the ministry was not yet in possession of the data published by Channel 12.

Head of Public Health Services Dr. Sharon Alroy-Preis said the first data about the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines against omicron were expected to be shared with Israel by South Africa on [Tue 30 Nov 2021]. However, the ministry had not yet received the information as of press time.

"The greatest concern for us is the very rapid spread of this variant in South Africa," Alroy-Preis told the Knesset Foreign Affairs Committee, describing how the daily cases there rose from 200 cases to 2000 cases in 10 days.

"From what we hear, those vaccinated do not have significant symptoms, it is a mild disease, but for now this is preliminary information," she noted. "Today there will be the first data on the efficacy of the vaccine."

Alroy-Preis explained the necessity of employing the Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) tracking system to locate those who were in contact with individuals infected with the variant or suspected to be infected.

"The Shin Bet system is one of our tools to identify and interrupt the transmission chains," she said. "The time it has bought for us is helping us to vaccinate the population and get our citizens to be in a more protected situation."

As of [Tue 30 Nov 2021] morning, the technology had been used to track the contacts of 13 people - 2 infected with omicron and 11 possibly infected. Exactly 186 individuals were identified, 42 of whom are suspected of being infected.

In order to verify their situation, they need to undergo a corona test, and if found positive, the results need to undergo genetic sequencing to check whether they are carrying the variant or a different strain.

If the number of people to track goes up to a few hundred, Alroy-Preis noted, there won't be a way to use the tracking technology anymore.

Two cardiologists from Sheba Medical Center were verified as infected with the omicron variant, a spokesperson for the hospital confirmed. He said they were experiencing "very light symptoms."

One of the doctors, in his mid 40s, brought the variant into Israel upon returning from a medical conference in London. He tested negative when he boarded the airplane from the United Kingdom to Israel and on arrival, but a few days later began experiencing symptoms. Once he tested positive, his results were sequenced and on [Tue 30 nov 2021] he was confirmed positive for the variant. Before entering isolation, the doctor had performed several cardiac catheterizations and attended at least 2 other large events. He was also in contact with the 2nd cardiologist, in his 70s, who is now also infected with the variant. Both doctors were fully vaccinated with 3 shots of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.

The hospital spokesperson said that anyone the doctors were in contact with has been informed, but there are no additional suspicious cases at the medical center at this time nor news of any related outbreaks.

At Soroka, Horowitz said again that the situation in Israel is under control and there is no need to panic. "We will not close the country and will maintain life as normal as possible," he noted. "There is currently no intention to impose restrictions on life within Israel, and we will do everything possible to ensure that this continues."

Horowitz also emphasized that the ban on foreign tourists is only temporary, and will not be automatically renewed.

In the meantime, the number of new cases in Israel remains stable. Exactly 636 new virus carriers were identified on [Mon 29 Nov 2021]. A week earlier they were 716. The total number of active cases on [Tue 30 Nov 2021] stood at 5600. In addition, there were 117 patients in serious condition, the lowest since July [2021].

Finally, the R rate measuring how many people each virus carrier infects slightly decreased on [Tue 30 Nov 2021], when it stood at 1.03.

[4] Origin of omicron
Date: Wed 1 Dec 2021
Source: Science [edited]
https://www.science.org/content/article/where-did-weird-omicron-come?utm_campaign=NewsfromScience&utm_source=Social&utm_medium=Twitter


Since South African scientists announced last week that they had identified an unsettling new variant of SARS-CoV-2, the world has anxiously awaited clues about how it might change the trajectory of the pandemic. But as big a mystery --if less urgent-- is where and how omicron evolved, and what lessons its emergence holds for avoiding future dangerous variants.

Omicron clearly did not develop out of one of the earlier variants of concern, such as alpha or delta. Instead, it appears to have evolved in parallel - and in the dark. Omicron is so different from the millions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes that have been shared publicly that pinpointing its closest relative is difficult, says Emma Hodcroft, a virologist at the University of Bern. It likely diverged early from other strains, she says. "I would say it goes back to mid-2020."

That raises the question of where omicron's predecessors lurked for more than a year. Scientists see essentially 3 possible explanations: the virus could have circulated and evolved in a population with little surveillance and sequencing. It could have gestated in a chronically infected COVID-19 patient. Or it might have evolved in a non-human species, from which it recently spilled back into people.

Christian Drosten, a virologist at Charite University Hospital Berlin, favors the first possibility. "I assume this evolved not in South Africa, where a lot of sequencing is going on, but somewhere else in southern Africa during the winter wave," he says. "There were a lot of infections going on for a long time and for this kind of virus to evolve you really need a huge evolutionary pressure."

But Andrew Rambaut of the University of Edinburgh can't see how the virus could have stayed hidden in a group of people for so long. "I'm not sure there's really anywhere in the world that is isolated enough for this sort of virus to transmit for that length of time without it emerging in various places," he says.

Instead, Rambaut and others propose the virus most likely developed in a chronically infected COVID-19 patient, likely someone whose immune response was impaired by another illness or a drug. When alpha was first discovered in late 2020, that variant also appeared to have acquired numerous mutations all at once, leading researchers to postulate a chronic infection. The idea is bolstered by sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 samples from some chronically infected patients.

"I think the evidence supporting it is becoming stronger," says Richard Lessells, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Kwa-Zulu-Natal. In one case Lessells and his colleagues described in a preprint, a young woman in South Africa with an uncontrolled HIV infection carried SARS-CoV-2 for more than 6 months. The virus accumulated many of the same changes seen in variants of concern, a pattern also seen in another patient whose SARS-Cov-2 infection persisted even longer. [Karim F, Moosa MYS, Gosnell BI, et al. Persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection and intra-host evolution in association with advanced HIV infection. medRxiv 2021.06.03.21258228; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.03.21258228]

To head off one possible source of future variants, Lessells says, "What we need to do is close the gaps in the HIV treatment cascade. So we need to get everybody diagnosed, we need to get everybody on to treatment, and we need to get those that are currently on ineffective treatment on to effective treatment regimens."

But Drosten says experience with chronic infections of influenza and other viruses in immunosuppressed patients argues against this hypothesis for omicron. Variants that elude the immune system do develop in such people, but they come with a host of other changes that make them less able to transmit from person to person. "These viruses have very low fitness out in the real world." That's because the mutations allowing a virus to survive in one individual over time may be very different from those needed to best spread from one person to the next.

Jessica Metcalf, an evolutionary biologist at the Institute of Advanced Study in Berlin, isn't so sure that is true for SARS-CoV-2. "I think one reason that this virus has done so well is that better binding to ACE2 [its receptor on human cells] helps for both within-host spread and between-host spread." Still, for the moment, she agrees with Drosten that omicron most likely circulated and evolved in a hidden population. Some think the virus might have hidden in rodents or other animals, rather than people, and therefore experienced different evolutionary pressures that selected for novel mutations. "The genome is just so weird," says Kristian Andersen, pointing to its medley of mutations, many of which have not been seen before in other variants.

"It is interesting, just how crazily different it is," says evolutionary biologist Mike Worobey of the University of Arizona. Although he favors an immunosuppressed person as the source of omicron, Worobey notes that 80% of white-tailed deer sampled in Iowa between late [November 2020] and early [January 2021] carried SARS-CoV-2, according to a recent preprint. "It does make me wonder if other species out there can become chronically infected, which would potentially provide this sort of selective pressure over time."

It's too early to rule out any theory about omicron's origin, says Aris Katzourakis, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Oxford, but he is skeptical of the animal scenario, given the sheer number of human infections. "I'd start worrying about animal reservoirs more if we were succeeding in suppressing the virus, and then I could see it as somewhere it might hide."

Many global health leaders have used the emergence of omicron to focus the world's attention on the huge gap between COVID-19 vaccinations in richer and poorer countries. Richard Hatchett, head of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, opened his remarks at the World Health Assembly on [Mon 29 Nov 2021] by saying low vaccine coverage in South Africa and Botswana had "provided a fertile environment" for the variant's evolution. "The global inequity that has characterized the global response has now come home to roost," he said.

Yet there is little evidence to support that statement, say some scientists. "The idea that if we had vaccinated more in Africa, we wouldn't have this: I'd like that to be true, but we have literally no way of knowing," says Katzourakis. For now, the lessons to be drawn from omicron remain as unknown as its origin.
