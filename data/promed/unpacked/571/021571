Britons warned not to eat undercooked pork
------------------------------------------
A rare [type] of the liver disease, hepatitis E, has killed 3 people
in Cornwall and caused at least 55 more across the UK to fall ill.
Hepatitis E is generally thought to be caused by poor sanitary
conditions and previously it had been assumed that British sufferers
had caught the disease abroad.

But Dr Harry Dalton, a consultant gastroenterologist at Royal
Cornwall Hospital Trust, said the recent patients he had seen did not
fit the usual criteria. He said: "Not only had the patients not
travelled abroad but they didn't fit the normal age range for the
virus. "In other parts of the world it usually affects the young.
However in the cases being seen in the UK, it is the middle aged and
elderly, particularly men." He believes that the main cause is
contact with raw pork and is now researching the link.

Patients with liver problems admitted to hospital will be checked to
see if the problems had been caused by hepatitis E [virus infection].
However a spokesman for the Health Protection Agency (HPA) said: "The
South West Peninsula HPA previously worked with Dr Harry Dalton,
Royal Cornwall Hospital Trust to investigate a number of hepatitis E
cases from Dec 2009 to March 2010 in the Cornwall area. The team
concluded that there was no epidemiological link between the cases or
an associated link with eating or handling pork. Although we are
aware of a number of hepatitis E cases in the UK the majority are
acquired outside the UK or related to travel to endemic countries."
It is acknowledged that pigs and pork can harbour [hepatitis E virus]
and that this may be the cause of the disease in cases where there
has not been any foreign travel, according to the HPA website.

Dr Dalton said those with existing liver conditions are most at risk
and advised people to take care when preparing pork. He added: "The
message is not to not eat pork, but to simply make sure it is cooked
properly and that hands are washed thoroughly after handling it raw."
Dr Dalton believes hepatitis E could be affecting as many as 1200
people in the UK every year. He said: "Victims become jaundiced and
this has resulted in patients being misdiagnosed as suffering [from]
alcohol abuse.

Dr Dalton said there have been 3 deaths related to hepatitis E
infection over the last 7 years and around 60 cases of hepatitis E in
Cornwall and Devon between 1999-2010, the vast majority of whom have
been seen since 2005. One victim of the disease, a 59-year-old man,
contracted hepatitis E and died in July 2006. His 63-year-old wife,
from Newquay in Cornwall, said he started feeling ill while he was
working at a factory next door to a pig farm. Medics have told the
family it is unclear whether he caught the virus because of exposure
to the pig farm or through consuming infected pork.

The HPA website said there were 178 cases of hepatitis E in Britain
in 2008 and 179 in 2009. Most people clear the infection without
treatment, however people with weakened immune systems or liver
disease may need closer observation, it said. There is no vaccine
against hepatitis E [virus infection]. In 2008, 4 people in Britain
fell ill with the virus after a world cruise. Infected shellfish were
found to be the cause.

[Hepatitis E was not recognized as a distinct human disease until
1980. Hepatitis E is caused by infection with hepatitis E virus
(HEV), a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus.
Although man is considered the natural host for HEV, antibodies to
HEV or closely related viruses have been detected in primates and
several other animal species.

HEV is transmitted via the faecal-oral route. Hepatitis E is a mostly
a waterborne disease, and contaminated water or food supplies have
been implicated in major outbreaks. Consumption of faecally
contaminated drinking water has given rise to epidemics, and the
ingestion of raw or uncooked shellfish has been the source of
sporadic cases in endemic areas. There is a possibility of zoonotic
spread of the virus, since several non-human primates, pigs, cows,
sheep, goats and rodents are susceptible to infection.
Person-to-person transmission is uncommon. There is no evidence for
sexual transmission or for transmission by transfusion. The highest
rates of infection occur in regions where low standards of
sanitation. However, sporadic cases of hepatitis E have also been
reported elsewhere.

In general, hepatitis E is a self-limiting viral infection followed
by recovery. Prolonged viraemia or faecal shedding are unusual and
chronic infection does not occur. Occasionally, a fulminant form of
hepatitis develops, with overall patient population mortality rates
ranging between 0.5 - 4.0 percent. The incubation period following
exposure to HEV ranges from 3 to 8 weeks, with a mean of 40 days. The
period of communicability is unknown. There are no chronic infections
reported. Typical signs and symptoms of hepatitis include jaundice
(yellow discoloration of the skin and sclera of the eyes, dark urine
and pale stools), anorexia (loss of appetite), an enlarged, tender
liver (hepatomegaly), abdominal pain and tenderness, nausea and
vomiting, and fever, although the disease may range in severity from
subclinical to fulminant.

It has recently been shown that HEV is present in both domestic pigs
and wild boar in various parts of Europe and the high genetic
similarity between HEV isolates from pigs and humans confirm previous
inferences of possible zoonotic transmission of HEV.
