An outbreak of Newcastle disease has claimed thousands of chickens in
Matabeleland North and Mashonaland Central Provinces, threatening the
poultry industry, officials confirmed yesterday.
The Principal Director of the Department of Veterinary Services, Dr
Stuart Hargreaves, confirmed the developments and said they had
started vaccination of birds to contain the disease, which is highly
infectious.
"I have received reports on the Newcastle disease outbreak although
you need to get the specific details from provincial heads," he said.
Dr Hargreaves said the Newcastle disease was widespread in backyard
fowl runs.
The Matabeleland North Provincial Veterinary Officer, Dr Polex Moyo,
said so far at least 24 000 chickens had been vaccinated since the
exercise began last week. He said some of the areas where vaccination
was taking place included Binga, Hwange, Lupane, Umguza, Tsholotsho,
Nyamandlovu and Bulawayo. He said his Department was working hard to
vaccinate chickens across the entire province.
"Our teams in the districts are busy with the vaccination of
chickens. So far at least 24 000 chickens have been vaccinated
although the number could be more as we are still compiling figures
from the teams on the ground," he said. Dr Moyo said the exercise had
also been extended to the multi-million dollar ostrich industry to
protect farmers from incurring losses, as the disease was highly
fatal.
He said people should suspect Newcastle disease if their chickens
just die in large numbers, develop stiff necks or are suddenly
paralysed. The disease, however, does not cause illness in human
beings who consume the meat of infected birds.

[Newcastle disease (NCD) is endemic in Zimbabwe; the last officially
reported outbreaks occurred during December 2004 (1 in Mashonaland
Central and 1 in Mashonaland East).
Clinical and postmortem-based diagnosis of NCD should be
laboratory-confirmed to exclude other possible diseases, particularly
highly pathogenic avian influenza. - Mod.AS]
