Additional FMD case discovered in S Korea's south eastern region
----------------------------------------------------------------
South Korea confirmed a single case of foot and mouth disease (FMD) on
Saturday [15 Jan 2011] in the country's south eastern region, as nationwide
vaccinations and quarantine efforts have started to help stem new outbreaks.

The additional case in Cheongsong, 285 km [177 miles] southeast of Seoul,
brings the total number of confirmed FMD outbreaks to 119, since animals
started showing symptoms in late November [2010], the Ministry of Food,
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said. There have been other confirmed
cases of animal disease outbreak but they are not counted because the
animals were culled before test results were completed.

All 30 animals on the small cattle farm have been ordered destroyed along
with livestock within a 500 meter [547 yard] radius of the site to prevent
further spread of the disease, the ministry said.

The disease, meanwhile, forced Seoul to cull and bury 1.6 million heads of
cattle, pigs, goats and deer with damage estimated to run to around 1.5
trillion won (USD 1.34 billion).

The country had moved to vaccinate a limited number of animals on 25 Dec
2010 after initial quarantine efforts proved inadequate to control the
outbreak that has spread to most parts of the country. Seoul said earlier
in the week that it will vaccinate all livestock across the country,
including those on Jeju Island off the country south western coast which
had not been affected so far.

The country has some 3 million cattle, 10 million pigs and large numbers of
other livestock that will need to receive shots.

In addition to the latest outbreaks that were 1st confirmed on 29 Nov 2010,
the country was hit by the disease in 2000, 2002 and 2 more times early
last year [by 2 different, separately introduced FMD virus strains, one
epizootic caused by serotype A, the later epizootic by serotype O -- which
is similar to the currently circulating strain. - Mod.AS]

[2] Water contamination?
Date: Fri 14 Jan 2011

Foot and mouth disease [FMD] -- will mass animal burials contaminate water
in South Korea?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As the virus sweeps South Korea's livestock industry, government officials
have ordered the burial of culled animals. The consequences to groundwater
from the slaughter and burial of so many animals have emerged as a public
concern, heightened by reports of biological contamination.

For instance, The Korea Times reported last week that tap water in a
village in Gyeonggi province was contaminated with blood. The news agency
reported that residents believe the contamination was related to a
livestock slaughter on 31 Dec 2010, when nearly 1000 pigs were buried alive
in response to an outbreak of FMD at a nearby farm.

Typically, animals are killed before disposal, but with the outbreak
spreading so fast, local authorities did not have the slaughterhouse
capacity to follow the rules. Instead, animals within a 500 meter radius of
the infected farm were dumped into a pit 5 meters deep that was lined with
double-folded vinyl. "It's possible that the vinyl could be torn by animals
struggling to survive," a quarantine officer told The Korea Times.

Residents in the village, located in a rural area near the northern city of
Paju, are concerned that the buried animals contaminated their groundwater
supply. It is unclear how many homes were affected and whether the bloody
tap water came from private wells or via a public treatment system.

In an interview with Circle of Blue, a Korean government official confirmed
that a farm drainage creek had been contaminated by the live burial near
the city of Paju. But the same official denied that blood had run through
the taps. The official -- who works at the Ministry of Public
Administration and Security and asked to be left anonymous since he does
not have the authority to speak publicly about the matter -- told Circle of
Blue that groundwater is regularly tested via government mandates and that
drinking water had not been contaminated by the bodily fluids of culled
pigs and cows.

The official said that mass slaughter is the most effective means for
controlling such a large outbreak. He also said that killing and burying
animals on-site is consistent with accepted public health practices.

The Asia-Pacific Business & Technology Report published a similar story
from the Gangwon province -- more than 3 hours away -- where more than 1000
pigs were buried on 4 Jan 2011. According to the report, "blood from the
bodies ran into underground water aquifers which supply local drinking water."

There have been confirmed cases in Gyeonggi, North Gyeongsang, Gangwon,
North and South Chungcheong provinces, as well as the city of Incheon.

Though the bloody tap water is an extraordinary event, groundwater
contamination from animal disposal is not.

Just 3 months ago, a local politician with the opposition party cited a
report in The Korea Times from the Ministry of Environment showing
groundwater sources near animal burial sites have been classified
"undrinkable" due to concentrations of colon bacillus -- a bacteria group
that includes E. coli -- that exceed the legal minimum.

In the United States, regulations for dead animal disposal vary by state.
Some states, like Missouri, suggest incineration, composting, or removal to
an approved landfill as safer methods than on-farm burial.

[3] Vaccination plans, regaining FMD-free status
Date: Fri 14 Jan 2011
Source: Yonhapnews [edited]

South Korea is seeking to regain its FMD-free country status without
resorting to constant use of vaccines, a senior level government official
said Friday [14 Jan 2011].

Deputy farm minister Lee Sang-kil said in a meeting with reporters that
Seoul's current stance is to swiftly carry out vaccination to stem the
rapid spread of the highly contagious animal disease, but not to give shots
on a regular basis. "Nationwide vaccination efforts are emergency measures
and not something Seoul wants to do permanently," he said.

The official said that while policymakers are not ruling out the use of
additional shots if the FMD virus is not destroyed, such a decision can
only be made after extensive testing is carried out on animals in the
country and consultation with experts.

Once ongoing vaccination efforts take effect and there are no more FMD
cases reported for over 6 months, the country will start taking steps to
regain its FMD-free status from the Paris-based World Organization for
Animal Health (OIE). He stressed, however, that such a step will take time.
"Everything will depend on how thoroughly decontamination efforts are
carried out during the spring and summer months when it is easier to
destroy the animal virus," he said. He predicted the government would
decide what course it must take in September 2011.

Lee said that if livestock tests reveal the virus has not been fully
destroyed, Seoul may have to give additional inoculations that could delay
the country's regaining of its FMD-free status for up to 2 years. Regaining
FMD-free status is important because it affects both export and imports and
overall health of the local livestock industry.

The official said that while South Korea can seek to become an FMD-free
country that uses vaccination from the OIE, like Argentina, there is a need
to carefully examine the cost of such a step. Vaccinating around 3.4
million cattle and 10 million pigs every 5 to 6 months [see comment] can
cost the country up to 100 billion won (USD 89.7 million) per year.

"In hindsight, it would have been cheaper if South Korea opted to vaccinate
animals but there was no way to predict the huge losses caused by the
latest outbreak," the official said. He pointed out that Seoul had no
outbreaks for 8 years after 2002, while those that occurred early last year
cost about 170 billion won.

The country has culled and buried 1.61 million heads of cattle, pigs, goats
and deer since the 1st case was confirmed on 29 Nov 2010. Total losses
incurred are estimated at a minimum of 1 trillion won, with numbers likely
to be higher once a complete tally is taken.

The official added that frontline experts are predicting FMD outbreaks to
come under control in one or 2 weeks, since it usually takes a month for
vaccines to start having an affect. The country started giving limited
shots on 25 Dec 2010 before ordering nationwide vaccinations earlier in the
week.

Quarantine officials, meanwhile, reported no new outbreaks for the day and
said there was a drop in number of suspected cases in recent days. The
country already gave shots to 1.6 million animals in areas that are exposed
to the disease.

[According to the South Korean media, the quarantine authorities have
imported FMD vaccines from England (where a commercial vaccine is
manufactured in a single facility, at Pirbright) and will import more from
Japan (data on this manufacturing laboratory would help). Information on
the vaccine strains included in the inactivated (killed) vaccines from each
manufacturer, as well as the vaccination scheme prescribed by them for each
species, would be appreciated. Are goats (there are about 270 000 of them
in South Korea, held in more than 20 000 establishments) and deer (about 79
000, held in more than 6000 establishments) to be included in the
vaccination scheme?

Vaccinating all cattle and pigs every 5 to 6 months, as indicated in item 3
above, is probably an ideal scheme but in vaccinated adult animals, a less
frequent re-vaccination policy may be acceptable. The adjuvant used should
also be taken into consideration (oil-adjuvant vaccines may confer a longer
protection and require a less frequent vaccination regime). - Mod.AS]
