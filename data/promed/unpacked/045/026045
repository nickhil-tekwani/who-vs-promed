ANNOUNCEMENTS (17): NEW PROMED-MAIL WEBSITE
*******************************************

A ProMED-mail post
http://www.promedmail.org
ProMED-mail is a program of the
International Society for Infectious Diseases
http://www.isid.org

Date: 9 Dec 2011
From: Larry Madoff <lmadoff@promedmail.org>


Dear ProMED colleagues:

We hope you have noticed our newly designed website now live at
http://www.promedmail.org.

Created in collaboration with our partners at <HealthMap.org>, our new
website provides immediate geographic localization of reports and
allows users to view reports in the context of nearby outbreaks. The
new site provides immediate access to reports from each of our
regional networks as well as the global ProMED-mail service.

It is now easier to print, email, and share ProMED reports on social
media like Facebook and Twitter. An updated search function allows
users to find reports in our entire archive of more than 60 000
reports dating back to 1994. Please let us know what you think and
give us your suggestions for improvements.

In addition to our new website, we also have new tools under the hood.
An enhanced editorial "dashboard," also designed and implemented in
collaboration with the HealthMap team, allows more rapid turn-around
of reports and automates entry of the report into the archive
database.

While these enhancements are made available to our users free of
charge, they are costly to produce. We need your financial support to
continue our efforts to provide up-to-date news of emerging disease
outbreaks in a variety of formats to our entire community.

Please help by making a donation to our end of the year campaign. As
always, donations are tax-deductible in the United States.

Donations are easy to make. Go to:

Thank you,
