Spread of Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever to Jinja NOT Confirmed
--------------------------------------------------------
[A UPI report dated 8 Dec 2000, posted as Ebola Hemorrhagic fever - Uganda
(50), suggested that the outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in Uganda had
spread to involve a fourth population center -- the town of Jinja. The
following statement negates this report. - Mod.CP
KAMPALA: Tests of blood samples taken from the 3 Ebola fever suspects
admitted last week to Jinja Hospital were found negative. The patients were
admitted to Jinja hospital on Thu 7 Dec 2000 on suspicion that they had
Ebola fever because they had diarrhea mixed with blood. The hospital
superintendent, Dr. Benon Wanume, said the patients, who have since
recovered, had been held in an isolation ward pending the results and 2
were discharged yesterday [Tue 12 Dec 2000. [The other patient, who had
responded rapidly to therapy, had been discharged on Saturday. Wanume said
that although the patients had responded to treatment dispensed to patients
suffering from diarrhea and dysentery, [2 of the 3 patients had been
detained in hospital until the results of laboratory tests had been
obtained. "I received the results of the blood test from Lacor Hospital
this morning. Ebola virus [had not been detected in the blood samples. The
tests concluded that the patients were suffering from dysentery," he said.

Social Issues Impede Control of Ebola Fever
-------------------------------------------
KAMPALA: The fight against Ebola hemorrhagic fever in Gulu has been
undermined by some residents who hide their sick relatives from health
workers. Dr. Paul Onek, the District Director of Health Services, said the
community needed more sensitization. "Many people have not yet changed
their attitude. Some of them are still hiding their sick relatives at home
because they don't want them isolated in hospitals. Others are still
sneaking [out at night to attend funerals," he said.
He appealed for more aid for Ebola fever survivors, some of whom have had
their houses and clothes burnt for fear of the [lethal disease. The Aswa
county MP, Reagan Okumu, said the Disaster Preparedness Ministry should
join the Health Ministry in the campaign against Ebola fever.
Okumu said the epidemic had already reached Pabbo Displaced People's Camp,
over 20 km from Gulu town. He appealed to [the members of other tribes not
to ostracize the Acholi because Ebola fever is a national issue. "I have
received reports that Acholi students at Makerere [University were being
shunned, because people think they [may be carriers of the Ebola virus.
This is unfortunate," Okumu said.

[The Ugandan population is an ethnic mix of 7 major tribal groups (Ganda,
Nyankole, Kiga, Soga, Iteso, Langi and Acholi) who make up 60 percent of
the population. The Acholi of the north comprise 4 percent of the
population and are the smallest of the tribes. - Mod.CP
