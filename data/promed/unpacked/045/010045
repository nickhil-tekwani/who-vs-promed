Three people from the same family in Adana's Tufanbeyli district died from an unidentified new virus that is believed to have been transmitted from bovine animals to humans, the authorities have announced. According to a report in the Hurriyet daily, [3] farmers died one after the other on Wed 8 Jul 2015 after they were hospitalized late on Tue 7 Jul 2015 for high fever and shivering. The victims had reportedly treated their cows early on Tuesday.

Following the deaths of the farmers, the town was placed under quarantine, and further measures have been taken in several other villages where bird flu was previously seen. Disinfection and hygienic measures have been increased in the affected neighborhood, and Adana municipal teams have been controlling all entries and exits from the district. In addition, hunting activities in the region have also been prohibited.

Speaking to the press following the incident, Balcali State Hospital head physician Dr Yesim Tasova said that even though the reason for the deaths of the farmers is unknown, they suspect the H5N1 bird flu virus. "For now, we do not know. The deaths of the 3 individuals happened so quickly. We have sent the bodies for autopsy. When we have the results, we will know the reasons for sure," Tasova stated.

A total of 150 000 chickens are believed to have been culled since January [2015] due to this incidence of bird flu.

[ProMED-mail requests further information on these 3 deaths from suspected infection with avian influenza. While there have been a large number of birds culled in 2015, it is not clear whether these farmers who had been working with bovines also had contact with poultry or wild birds. For a report on the implication of wild birds in avian flu in Turkey and a request for information on the subject, see: Avian Influenza (168): Turkey (IB) wild birds, RFI 20150704.3485249.
