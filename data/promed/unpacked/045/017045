8 mumps cases confirmed at MU [University of Missouri], number expected to increase
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Eight MU students been diagnosed with mumps, and the MU Student Health Center expects that number to rise over the next 25 days.

On Wed [2 Nov 2016], the MU News Bureau confirmed that 4 students had been diagnosed with the virus, and the health center updated the total to 8 on Fri [4 Nov 2016] afternoon.

Some other students have made appointments with the Student Health Center and displayed symptoms of mumps, but it will take up to a week before test results come in, health center spokesperson Pam Roe said. She did not have an exact number of how many students have come in with symptoms of the virus.

It can take about 25 days to display symptoms of mumps, which include a fever, swollen glands, fatigue, aching muscles and a headache, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. The virus is spread through mucus or saliva.

Nine MU students were confirmed to have mumps in the summer of 2015, and one student was diagnosed in April [2016].

Students who have received the Mumps, Measles and Rubella [MMR] vaccine are 9 times less likely to contract the illness, Roe said. Those with a vaccine will likely have fewer or less intense symptoms.

Anyone with these symptoms should seek medical attention immediately, Roe said. Students should not attend their classes if they show symptoms.

[Mumps is becoming increasingly more common on college campuses in the United States. In 2016, the disease has been reported at the State University of New York at Buffalo, Indiana University, University of Kentucky, University of San Diego, University of Southern Maine, Saint Anselm College [New Hampshire] and Harvard University [Massachusetts], among others (from http://outbreaknewstoday.com/mumps-alert-issued-at-the-university-of-missouri-47560/).

Most children in the US are immunized as infants and toddlers, but may not be protected for life. And, of course, those who do not get vaccinated are not protected. Adults who move to the US from countries without MMR immunization programs, are at risk. Global travel increases the chances of these diseases spreading. It is likely for these reasons that we are seeing mumps cases at colleges in the US. - Mod.LK
