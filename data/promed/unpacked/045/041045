Angiostrongylus in Hawaii
-------------------------
The pain was so bad he screamed for hours. "It
just got so intense, nothing took the pain away,"
said a Big Island resident, 36 [patient 1]. "It
felt like they were doing surgery on me and
ripping out my organs." The patient was a victim
of what is commonly called rat lungworm disease,
a rare ailment that has inexplicably hit 3 Big
Island residents hard in the last few weeks.

Dr. Jon Martell, the attending physician at Hilo
Medical Center, said the 3 patients are the worst
he has seen in his 14 years of treating such cases.

The disease arises from parasitic worms,
Angiostrongylus cantonensis, sometimes ingested
inadvertently by eating raw produce that contains
a small snail or slug. The worms migrate through
the human body and usually die after several
weeks. Most people recover fully without
treatment, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

But sometimes the larvae migrate into cerebral
fluid, causing inflammation in the brain and
spinal cord membrane and a form of meningitis,
according to a study by the state and CDC
published in 2007. In some cases, rat lungworm
disease can cause significant pain and trauma,
including paralysis, blindness and death, as
occurred in a fatal case in Taiwan in 1944, according to the study.

The study identified 24 rat lungworm cases in
Hawaii from January 2001 to February 2005,
including 11 on Oahu, 9 on the Big Island, 3 on
Maui and one on Lanai. Patients usually became
sick in 3 days, but one took as long as 48 days, according to the study.

The patient 1, quoted above, said he and a friend
[patient 2], who live in Black Sands between
Pahoa and Kalapana, have been eating raw
vegetables and taking precautions by cleaning the
produce with a peroxide rinse. He suspects they
may have accidentally consumed tiny larvae of
slugs lodged in the deep folds of peppers.

Patient 1 said [patient 2] came down with
agonizing pain, but no one at Hilo Medical Center
could find anything wrong with her initially and
she was not admitted to the hospital. "I had to
take her home ... 3 separate times," he said. "No
one should have to be turned away."

[Patient 2] has been in a coma for several days, he said.

Dr. Sarah Park, state epidemiologist, said there
is no diagnostic test that confirms the presence
of rat lungworm disease, short of finding the
parasite, and physicians have to rely partially
on the likelihood of possible exposure through a
patient's food history. She said in certain
instances, an analysis of spinal fluid can
indicate the likelihood of rat lungworm disease.
Park said there is no medical treatment for the
disease, and physicians treat the symptoms with
pain relievers for aches and steroids for inflammation.

A 24-year-old Puna man was admitted to Hilo
Medical Center with a case last week. She said
others have contracted the disease but have not
gone to the hospital because they do not have medical insurance.

Park said the movement to consume home-grown
produce is great and that people simply dunk
produce in water and assume it is clean. "You've
got to clean each leaf," she said. "Our biggest
challenge is constantly reminding people about
the risks." Park said a species of slug on the
Big Island has tiny larvae, about 1 to 2 millimeters long.

The presence of the Southeast Asian slug,
Parmarion martens, was noticed about 10 years ago
and has spread rapidly, said Robert
Hollingsworth, an entomologist with the U.S.
Pacific Basin Agricultural Research Center. "The
concern is when it's very small and hard to see," he said.

[Angiostrongylus cantonensis is spreading in
countries of the Pacific rim including Hawaii
probably spread by rats carried on ships.
According the CDC: "People can get infected by
eating raw or undercooked snails or slugs that
are infected with this parasite. In some
cultures, snails are commonly eaten. Some
children, in particular, have gotten infected by
swallowing snails/slugs "on a dare." People also
can get infected by accident, by eating raw
produce (such as lettuce) that contains a small snail or slug or part of one"
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/parasites/angiostrongylus/factsht_angiostrongylus.htm>).

The article refer to a sudy by Hochberg et al.
(Distribution of eosinophilic meningitis cases
attributable to Angiostrongylus cantonensis,
Hawaii. Emerg Infect Dis. 2007;13:1675-80). The
study identified 24 cases of eosinophilic
meningitis attributable to A.catonensis, but did
not discuss the transmission routes.
