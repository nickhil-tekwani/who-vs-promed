65-year-old man diagnosed with plague in Bernalillo County [New Mexico]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A Bernalillo County [New Mexico] man has been infected with the plague. Health officials say infected fleas are spreading the disease. A New Mexican has already died this year [2015] after being infected.

And with this new case there is growing concern. Health officials say the latest patient is an East Mountain man. That area would be more susceptible because of the rabbit and rodent population there. The plague infects those animals and then the fleas on them carry it elsewhere, including to pets and people.

Health officials say people in town are at less of risk but there's still a risk. They say the best advice is to make sure your animals have a year-round flea treatment to keep the bugs away. There's also a chance your pet can get infected if they eat an animal that has died from the disease. This year officials say the risk is greater.

The other case this year was of a 52-year-old woman from Santa Fe County. She died from the illness.

Along with the 2 human cases this year, there have been 7 confirmed cases in animals.

[This has been a prominent year for _Yersinia pestis_ infections in the USA, with 8 reported cases including 3 fatalities, and with one of the cases presenting in Georgia (the 1st case reported in that state) but acquired in California. The manifestations of _Yersinia pestis_ infection in this case are not stated, although overall 95 percent of cases are bubonic in nature. Deaths from plague generally occur from septicemic or pneumonic plague. Only pneumonic plague can be spread from person to person.
