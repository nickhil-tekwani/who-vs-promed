[This is the 5th consecutive day with no newly confirmed cases reported from Wuhan or all of Hubei province in the past 24 hours. There are no newly suspected cases in Wuhan or Hubei. There are 45 new cases reported to have been confirmed in the past 24 hours. All but 1 of the reported newly confirmed cases are imported. It would be interesting to know if the non-imported case in Henan was associated with prior imported cases or if it was identified as a community acquired case with no known identifiable chain of transmission.

According to the report above, a total of 81 439 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, representing an increase of 45 cases in the past 24 hours since yesterday's (27 Mar 2020) report was prepared. In addition, 5 deaths were reported, all in Hubei province (all 5 in Wuhan). 64 new cases were reported from Hong Kong, which continues to increase the number of newly confirmed cases on a daily basis. And Macau reported 3 additional newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, bringing their total to 37.

A total of 44 were imported cases into China. Cases were reported by Guangdong (8), Tianjin (7), Shanghai (7), Beijing (4), Liaoning (3), Jiangsu (3), Zhejiang (3), Sichuan (2), Shanxi (1), Inner Mongolia (1), Jilin (1), Fujian (1), Jiangxi (1), Chongqing (1), and Guizhou (1), bringing the total number of imported cases to 693.

As reported on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and will end it in Wuhan on 6 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world will be watching carefully to see if this is safe timing...

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 105 cases and 8 deaths as compared with yesterday's 24 hour period (27-28 Mar 2020) when there were 146 newly confirmed cases. There were a total of 9538 cases including 152 deaths reported today up from 9478 cases and 144 deaths yesterday [28 Mar 2020]. The daily newly confirmed case count had been at or below 100 newly confirmed cases per day for 7 consecutive days. Daegu continues to stand out as a focal point for transmission with 69% of the total cases reported followed by Gyeongbuk with 13.4% of the total cases reported. In the past 24 hours, Daegu reported 21.9%% of the total newly confirmed cases while Seoul represented 19.1% of the newly confirmed case reports and in Gyeonggi 14.3%. Quarantined imported cases represented 20.0% of the newly confirmed cases.

Similar to what is being seen in China, Korea is identifying increasing numbers of imported cases returning to South Korea. They are now up to 189 imported cases in quarantine with the 1st report of patients in quarantine on 16 Mar 2020, when 4 cases were reported (COVID-19 update (41): global, surge capacity, vaccine development, WHO 20200316.7096222). Like in China, there is strict surveillance and follow-up of these individuals, reversing the pattern of the western countries strengthening screenings of individuals from South Korea and China. There are obvious concerns regarding initiating new clusters that might escape into the community.

In the English language update for today ("105 additional cases have been confirmed" https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030) there are a series of graphs and tables showing epidemiologic presentations of the outbreak. Growth curves clearly show how Daegu and Gyeongbuk have leveled off and slowed down growth while Seoul and Gyeonggi are still in an accelerated growth pattern. A fascinating look at the outbreak is demonstrated in the 2nd graph where they have plotted the daily newly confirmed cases juxtaposing the daily number of individuals in isolation. One clearly sees how the outbreak peaked 8-12 Mar 2020 and is on a significant downward slope since 12 Mar 2020.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 92 472 cases, including 10 023 deaths, up from 86 498 cases and 9134 deaths reported on 27 Mar 2020. The 24-hour change between 27 and 28 Mar 2020 was 5974 newly confirmed cases, compared with 5959 newly confirmed cases between 26 and 27 Mar 2020. Cases continue to be concentrated in Lombardy (39 415), the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna (12 383), and Venice (7930), all in the northern part of the country. Those 3 provinces combined account for 56% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, representing a drop from the previous 24 hours when they represented 62.8% of nationally reported cases. Another active province is Piemonte with a total of 7671 cases and represents 9.7% of newly reported cases. In the past 24 hours Tuscany has increased from reporting 3.8% of newly reported cases to representing 6.1% of newly confirmed cases. There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 18 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 17 days since the countrywide lockdown. The MOH website mentions there has been a slowing down of growth.

[4] Iran: 32 232 total cases, 2378 deaths
Date: Sat 28 Mar 2020

The Head of the Epidemiology Committee of Iran's Coronavirus Combat Taskforce on Saturday [28 Mar 2020] said coronavirus (SARS-2-CoV) was spreading in Iran without being noticed since around [20 Jan 2020]. In a video conference with reporters, Dr Ali-Akbar Haqdoust said there was a delay in detection of the virus in Iran. Iranian Health Ministry officials have until now insisted that the virus arrived in the country about 2 weeks later, in February [2020].

On [13 Mar 2020] Dr Reza Malekzadeh, Deputy Health Minister had also pointed out that there had been a "delay" in the detection of coronavirus leading to incorrect diagnoses of the early cases as forms of flu. Dr Haqdoust also said the virus had been "moving around" several cities and the earliest cases were either "without symptom" or not shown coronavirus-specific symptoms.

According to Dr Haqdoust the epidemic currently does not seem to have reached its peak in Tehran. Iran expects to bring the epidemic under control in late April [2020] and put the 1st epidemic stage of the virus before the end of the summer [2020], he said. Dr Haqdoust added that schools and universities can only be opened again when "at least 2 10-day cycles of reduction in the number of new cases is reported".

With 139 more deaths from coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in 24 hours, Iran's death toll has reached 2517, the Health Ministry spokesman said. The confirmed infection cases have also gone up to 35 408 with 3076 more people contracting the disease in the same period.

According to Iran's official coronavirus statistics, the highest number of deaths since the 2 1st deaths from COVID-19 were reported in Qom on [19 Feb 2020] was registered on [26 Mar 2020] with 157 deaths.

Critics say the virus could not have spread across the country as fast if the government had taken measures to quarantine Qom, the epicenter of the outbreak. Stricter measures for traveling from highly contaminated areas have now been introduced but urban public transport is still in use despite calls to halt them. Officials have been making contradictory statements regarding the scope of restrictions and how they will be enforced.

[In the 24 hours from 27 to 28 Mar 2020, the number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 32 332 to, 35 408, an increase of 3076 newly confirmed cases. The number of deaths has also increased from 2378 to 2517 an increase of 139 deaths in the 24-hour period.

The recognition that the transmission probably began 2 weeks earlier than when the COVID-19 cases were first confirmed is a plausible estimate. Other countries have had major escalations over a 2 week period, it is a plausible estimate. It would be interesting to see the influenza surveillance curve to determine if there is an unusual increase around that time that may be feeding into this estimate.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 123 750 including 2227 deaths. New York state, with 53 455 (43.2%) cumulative cases reports and 7193 (36.7%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is showing increases. Daily reported case counts are accelerating in Michigan, Florida, Louisiana, and Massachusetts.

The CDC website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has 2 epidemic curves. One focuses on date of confirmation of disease, the other on date of onset of illness. The curve of interest, by date of onset of disease, is based on 17.3% of the number of cases plotted on the epidemic curve using date of confirmation of disease.
