A Red Robin restaurant was evacuated and closed after 24 customers became sick because of high levels of carbon monoxide Friday [30 Nov 2018] night in south suburban Orland Park. About 7:22 PM, 2 dozen customers reported feeling sick and having headaches while dining at the restaurant, located at 15502 South LaGrange Road, according to the Orland Fire Protection District.

Fire officials were called to the restaurant and tested the atmosphere, which showed high levels of carbon monoxide with readings of 400 ppm, the fire district said. Customers and employees were evacuated. In all, 4 people were taken to local hospitals and another 20 were treated by paramedics at the scene, authorities said.

Firefighters monitored the HVAC units causing the problem while the restaurant was ventilated and inspected by the Village of Orland Park Building Department, authorities said. The Red Robin was closed Friday [30 Nov 2018] night and remained closed pending repairs, authorities.

[Carbon monoxide (CO) is a deadly odorless and colorless gas. CO is most often associated with the fumes from burning fuel in some type of engine, a car, a small engine, a boiler, a gas furnace, or, as in this case, a grill. CO can build up, particularly indoors, and be the source of a poisoning of multiple people.

In lower doses, a person may experience headaches or dizziness or faint. But in other instances, the high level can overcome a person with little or no warning. Furthermore, those with heart disease or lung disease may be at more risk of collapsing.

Generally, if provided fresh breathing air in a timely manner, the affected individual can recover. However, it does not take a long time of breathing high levels of CO to result in death.

We hope the 4 individuals taken to the hospital have recovered. Likely the restaurant is closed until the air handling system is repaired. - Mod.TG
