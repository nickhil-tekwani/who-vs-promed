Pets face risk from bovine TB [tuberculosis]
--------------------------------------------
Family pets could be at increasing risk from contracting TB as the disease
spreads through wildlife and cattle herds. Now environment secretary Hilary
Benn has been urged to do more to collect data on the number of cats, dogs,
and other household animals struck down with tuberculosis.

Figures show that last year [2007], 15 cats were infected -- including 8
across Devon, Cornwall, and Somerset -- compared with just 2 recorded cases
in 1998.

Cattle herds in the West Country are the hardest hit by TB infections, with
some areas seeing the number of cases increase by more than a third year on
year. In the 1st half of this year [2008], Cornwall saw 135 new cases
confirmed, Devon 284, Somerset 68, and Dorset 22.

But the potential threat to other animals has worried pet owners. A Cornish
woman, her daughter, and the family dog were infected with bovine TB late
last year [2007]. Research suggested they had probably contracted the
disease from badgers.

Now members of parliamemt (MPs) are calling on the government to broaden
its approach to tackling the disease -- not just focus on the affects on
cattle. Mr Benn recently announced plans to create a Bovine TB Eradication
Group comprising of industry figures, vets, animal health experts, and
officials from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
[DEFRA] to work together on drawing up a detailed strategy. But he faced
calls in Westminster to expand the scope of the group to include family pets.

In 2007, 5 domestic pigs, 2 goats, 4 alpacas, and 16 llamas were infected
with TB in England and Wales. In the last 5 years, 48 cats have been
recorded nationwide with the disease. Defra vets admit that in areas where
there is "a lot of disease in cattle," it could present a "greater risk of
transmission to domestic species... but not necessarily."

Liberal Democrat MP Dan Rogerson, a member of the Commons environment
select committee, said: "At this stage, this is still not numbers people
should be worried about. If it is increasing in cattle and badgers, now is
the time to be talking about it, not waiting until it becomes a problem."
The North Cornwall MP said the new Bovine TB Eradication Group should not
simply focus on the disease in cattle herds, and should be expanded to
include the apparent growing rate of infection among domestic pets. "If it
is going across to other species, it could be a risk to pets and people. We
actually don't know the size of the problem."

The government insists that changes made in 2005 to the reporting procedure
for TB in pets may have had an effect on the rise in numbers. Mr Benn said:
"We should seek to understand what the rise in the figures tells us,
bearing in mind the changes in reporting requirements. The health
protection agency assessment of the risk to human health is low."
Challenged about the potential for cross over between wildlife and pets, he
added: "The figures wouldn't appear to demonstrate that that is the case to
date, but obviously we keep a very close eye on it." He insisted the focus
of the new group would be on tackling the level of disease in cattle for
"obvious reasons."

[Finding bovine TB in household animals (cats in this case) must be an
indicator that unpasteurised milk from reactor herds is available and is
being purchased by the public. And thus the humans in these households are
also at risk of acquiring an _M. bovis_ infection, which in humans can be
nasty. And even if all these cats are farm cats that does not diminish the
human risk. The account is brief but if there were 8/15 cats in 2007
infected in the high bovine TB-incidence counties of Cornwall, Devon, and
Somerset, the remainder, 7/15, which is statistically identical with 8/15,
were in counties of lower incidence or risk. When one must consider that
only an unknown fraction of the infected cats is being identified, I would
be tempted to assume that the risk both to household animals and humans is
a lot higher and more widespread than is being appreciated by the UK
authorities. - Mod.MHJ]
