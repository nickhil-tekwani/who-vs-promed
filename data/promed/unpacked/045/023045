We are writing to provide further details with regard the ProMED
posting: Salmonellosis, university - Canada: (ON) 20071121.3770.

The salmonella outbreak in London, Ontario has been confirmed as
_Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhimurium, Phage Type 108, Pulsed
Field Gel Electrophoresis pattern STXAI.0312. To date, 72
laboratory-confirmed cases have been associated with this outbreak,
although serotype and/or molecular typing are pending for several cases.

The outbreak has occurred in 2 waves. The 1st wave appears to be
related to food purchased at a food outlet that sells pitas located
in the University Community Centre (UCC) at The University of Western
Ontario, in a location referred to as Centre Spot. To date, 34
laboratory-confirmed cases have reported eating food from this
outlet, with the majority reporting eating on or around 2 Nov 2007.

The 2nd wave of cases appears to be related to consuming food
prepared at the UCC Centre Spot but not related to the pita outlet.
The UCC Centre spot has several food outlets on site and also
produces food that is distributed to various outlets across campus.
To date, there are 28 laboratory-confirmed cases who have eaten food
that was prepared at the Centre Spot, but not at the pita outlet. The
majority of exposures in the 2nd wave occurred from 5 to 9 Nov 2007
and into the week of 12 Nov 2007.

In addition to the above mentioned cases, there are 4 people with
laboratory-confirmed salmonella who ate on campus, but their
potential exposure sources are currently unclear; 2 who appear not to
have had an exposure related to eating on campus, one who appears to
have contracted their infection from a close contact, and 3 cases who
have yet to be reached.

Detailed interviews were conducted with all ill individuals. There
does not appear to be a single, common food item that would explain
the cases. Among the cases in the 1st wave related to the pita
outlet, their consumption patterns reflect the average pita purchases
of the outlet.

To investigate the source of the exposure, all food handlers who
worked at the pita outlet were requested to submit stool samples,
along with several other food handlers who prepare food at the UCC
Centre Spot. None of the tests on these individuals who were
requested to submit stools have been positive for _Salmonella_,
however, there are several other campus food handlers who have
developed salmonellosis. The date of symptom onset in these positive
food handlers suggests that they acquired their infection from eating
or working at the UCC Centre Spot and not that they are the source of
this outbreak. Environmental and food samples were taken on 9 and 13
Nov 2007 from the UCC Centre Spot (including the pita outlet and
other locations) and have been negative for salmonella.

Even though the samples are negative, the outbreak appears to be
consistent with cross contamination within the UCC Centre Spot. Based
on this, the University conducted a thorough cleaning and sanitation
over the weekend of 16-18 Nov 2007. It is hoped that this will
eliminate any source of ongoing transmission.

A case control study is being conducted to gain a better
understanding of the 1st wave of the outbreak related to the pita
outlet. Additional analyses are also being considered for the 2nd wave.
