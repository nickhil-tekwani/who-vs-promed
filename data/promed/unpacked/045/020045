Livestock producers are urged to check their cattle for signs of botulism following confirmed cases near Longreach, Winton, and Aramac [Queensland].

Biosecurity Queensland Animal Biosecurity and Welfare inspector Nicole Restelli said climatic conditions were contributing to the recent cases. "Recent confirmed cases of botulism have been found in areas where it doesn't usually occur. All producers should monitor their herds for signs and take appropriate preventative measures."

Clinical signs of botulism include:
- ascending muscular paralysis starting at the hind legs and extending forward to the jaw and throat;
- staggering, knuckling over, inability to rise, laying down with head outstretched or turned to the flank;
- paralysis progresses until the muscles of respiration fail and death occurs in 1 to 6 days after illness starts.

Ms Restelli said that there is no known treatment for botulism, so control and prevention is essential. "Prompt diagnosis and control measures can help bring the situation under control," Ms Restelli said.

"If livestock owners suspect botulism is the cause of disease in stock, it is important they seek immediate assistance from a veterinarian as the disease can result in significant losses over a short period of time." Ms Restelli said producers were urged to take preventative measures to reduce the likelihood of outbreaks in their herds.

"Botulism is caused by livestock ingesting a toxin that is produced by _Clostridium botulinum_ bacteria which can be found in decaying animal and vegetable matter," Ms Restelli said. "Animals are likely to eat decaying matter when there is a deficiency of phosphorus and protein in the feed that is available and when feed quality and quantity declines. Producers can deter botulism outbreaks in their herds by preventing stock having access to animal carcasses, controlling vermin and pest animals, and providing nutritional supplements of protein and phosphorus to reduce bone chewing. Taking care with harvest and storage of feeds to reduce the possibility of small animals contaminating feeds and checking water sources regularly are also recommended. Vaccination programs are essential in endemic areas and are the best form of protection for livestock," she said.

Botulism is a fatal neurological disease that affects cattle and other species of animals such as sheep and horses. If you suspect your livestock are infected with botulism, you should immediately report your concerns to 13 25 23 (business hours) or 1800 675 888 (after hours) and seek veterinary advice.

[Botulism is a paralytic disease caused by the neurotoxins of _Clostridium botulinum_ and in rare cases, _Clostridium butyricum_ and _Clostridium baratii._ These Gram positive spore-forming anaerobes can be found in soil samples and marine sediments throughout the world.

Differences in antigenicity among the toxins produced by different strains of botulism-causing organisms allow for separation of the organisms into 7 distinct types (A-G). Types A, B, and E are the toxins most often responsible for disease in humans, whereas types C and D only cause disease in other animals (such as, non human mammals, birds, fish). In rare instances, a single strain of organism may produce 2 toxins.

_C. botulinum_ is distributed widely throughout the environment and can be found in soil, freshwater and saltwater sediments, household dust, and on the surfaces of many foods. The toxins produced are cytoplasmic proteins (mass = 150 kDa) released as cells lyse. While the spores survive 2 hours at 100 deg C/212 deg F (but die rapidly at 120 deg C/248 deg F), the exotoxin is heat labile and becomes inactive after one minute at 85 deg C/185 deg F or 5 minutes at 80 deg C/176 deg F.

Although the mode of entry of toxin may differ between the different forms of diseases, once the toxin enters the bloodstream, it acts in a similar manner to produce the clinical signs and symptoms. The toxin binds to receptors on presynaptic terminals of cholinergic [neuron] synapses, is internalized into vesicles, and then is translocated to the cytosol. In the cytosol, the toxin mediates the proteolysis of components of the calcium-induced exocytosis apparatus (the SNARE proteins) to interfere with acetylcholine release. Blockade of neurotransmitter release at the terminal is permanent, and recovery only occurs when the axon sprouts a new terminal to replace the toxin-damaged one.

It is difficult to tell from the article how widespread this situation is. So while botulism can come from the soil, it can also be in hay if animals are being supplemented with this feed. When other animals are unintentionally baled into the hay it can cause botulism poisoning in the cattle.

One wonders if they have looked at this means as the article does not tell us about any supplemental feeding or if they are investigating that as a possibility. The article also does not tell us the type of botulism involved and we would appreciate an authoritative response to the situation.
