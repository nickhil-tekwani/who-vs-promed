Pockets of unvaccinated children have provided fertile ground for the measles virus to take hold, resulting in 22 infected persons in Washington state and 177 in New York City, NBC News reported on [Tue 22 Jan 2019]. Most of the victims in New York are members of Orthodox Jewish communities across the state, according to NBC.

As a result of widespread vaccination, the disease was declared eliminated from the Americas in 2016 but reappeared in 2017 and 2018 in the USA. At this point it is speculated that the measles were brought back to New York state by travelers returning from Israel, where the health ministry has been combatting an epidemic of measles resulting from population clusters where parents are refusing to inoculate their children.

This January [2019], the World Health Organization said anti-vaccination movements are among the 10 threats to global health in 2019. "Measles, for example, has seen a 30% increase in cases globally. The reasons for this rise are complex, and not all of these cases are due to vaccine hesitancy. However, some countries that were close to eliminating the disease have seen a resurgence," WHO said in its report.

According to the CDC, in 2018, 349 individual cases of measles were confirmed in 26 states and the District of Columbia. This was the 2nd-greatest number of annual cases reported since measles was eliminated in the USA. The worst year was 2014, with 667 cases.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/01/23/an-anti-vaccination-hotspot-near-portland-suffers-public-health-emergency-over-measles/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.8de9617de0e4


A quickly escalating measles outbreak around Portland, Oregon, has led health officials in nearby Clark County, Washington, to declare a public health emergency as they warn that people infected with the highly contagious virus have visited schools and churches, a dentist's office, a Costco, an Ikea, and an Amazon locker pickup station.

Someone with measles was at Concourse D of the Portland International Airport on [Mon 7 Jan 2019], the county's public health department advised. An infected person attended a Portland Trail Blazers home game [Fri 11 Jan 2019].

At the beginning of last week [week of Mon 14 Jan 2019], there were only a handful of confirmed cases. On Friday [18 Jan 2019], the day the emergency was declared, there were 19. By Sunday [20 Jan 2019], that number had grown to 21. The latest update came Tuesday [22 Jan 2019], when county officials said they had confirmed 23 cases and were investigating 2 more suspected cases. The vast majority of those who have fallen ill had not been immunized.

The outbreak makes concrete the fear of pediatric epidemiologists that a citadel of the movement against compulsory vaccination could be susceptible to the rapid spread of a potentially deadly disease.

"It's alarming," Douglas J. Opel, a pediatrician at Seattle Children's Hospital, said in an interview with The Washington Post. "Any time we have an outbreak of a disease that we have a safe and effective vaccine against, it should raise a red flag."

State data shows that 7.9% of children in Clark County were exempt in the 2017-2018 school year from vaccines required for kindergarten entry, which includes the 2-dose course for measles that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says is 97% effective. Only 1.2% of the children had a medical dispensation, meaning that nearly 7% were not immunized for personal or religious reasons. Nationally, about 2% of children went without required immunizations for nonmedical reasons.

The high rate of nonmedical exemption for vaccines is what makes the Portland area, which sits across the Columbia River from Clark County, a "hotspot" for outbreaks, according to Peter J. Hotez, a professor of pediatrics and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. "This is something I've predicted for a while now," he said of the public health emergency in Clark County. "It's really awful and really tragic and totally preventable."

Of the confirmed cases, 18 patients are between the ages of one and 10 years old. Twenty of the infected individuals had not been immunized against measles, and the vaccination history of the other 3 remained unverified. One person was hospitalized.

Experts advised that the outbreak could still be in its infancy. The incubation period of the virus averages 2 weeks, and it can be spread 4 days before a rash makes its onset obvious.

Because measles is among the most highly contagious of all infectious diseases, it is bound to flare up in areas with low vaccination rates, Hotez said. He tracked this effect in a paper last year [2018] in the Public Library of Science, linking the number of philosophical exemptions, which has climbed since 2009 in 12 of the 18 states that allow them, to increasing outbreaks. [ref: Olive JK, Hotez PJ, Damania A, Nolan MS: The state of the antivaccine movement in the United States: A focused examination of nonmedical exemptions in states and counties. PLoS Med. 2018; 15(6): e1002578. doi: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002578.]

The problem is especially pronounced, the paper found, in more than a dozen "hotspot metropolitan areas," including Portland and Seattle in the Northwest, Phoenix in the Southwest, and Detroit in the Midwest.

Public health experts are sounding alarms about the geographical clustering of people who refuse to immunize themselves, which creates vulnerabilities despite the overall high rate of vaccination. In November [2019], Asheville, North Carolina, another stronghold of the anti-vaccination movement, succumbed to the state's worst chickenpox outbreak since a vaccine for the infection became available more than 2 decades ago.

"Portland is a total train wreck when it comes to vaccine rates," Hotez said in an interview with The Post.

Opposition to compulsory vaccination in the Pacific Northwest dates to the Progressive Era and continues despite major medical breakthroughs. The modern anti-vaccination movement -- built on debunked research published in 1998 that associated the vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella, known as the MMR vaccine, with autism -- is not exclusive to one side of the political divide, survey data suggests; it tends to find its most fervent supporters at both extremes.

Measles is a dire price to pay for leniency about vaccination, Hotez cautioned, calling the illness "one of the most serious infectious diseases known to humankind." After smallpox was eradicated in 1980, measles became the leading killer of children globally, he said.

In 2000, public health officials declared measles eliminated in the USA because more than a year had gone by without continuous transmission of the disease. But recent outbreaks supply evidence of dangerous backsliding in containment of the virus, Hotez said, blaming the anti-vaccination movement. "This is a self-inflicted wound," he said.

In 2015, a woman in northwestern Washington died of pneumonia after contracting measles. It was the 1st U.S. death from the virus since 2003.

Last year [2018] saw the 2nd-highest number of reported cases of measles since 2000, according to the CDC. A total of 349 cases were confirmed across 26 states and the District of Columbia, only surpassed by the 667 cases in 2014. Orthodox Jewish communities were at the center of several outbreaks last year [2018] in New York and New Jersey, after unvaccinated travelers returned with the virus from Israel, which was battling an outbreak. The year before [2017], Minnesota reported 75 cases of measles, mostly in a Somali community where the discredited theory blaming autism on the MMR vaccine had taken hold.

Because measles is still endemic in parts of the world, said Opel, "periodic introduction by people traveling is what's causing frequent outbreaks here."

[About 78% of public school students in Clark County have completed their vaccinations (well below the 95% coverage needed), Clark County Public Health director Dr. Alan Melnick said in a statement. The county has one of the worst vaccinations rates in the state, The Oregonian reported, citing state records (http://www.ksro.com/2019/01/22/public-health-officials-confirm-measles-outbreak-in-washington-state-at-22-cases/).

In 2018, 349 individual cases of measles were confirmed in 26 states, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (https://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html).

This is the 2nd-greatest toll since measles was considered eradicated in the US in 2000.]

In a follow-up on the measles epidemic in Ukraine, health officials report an additional 3450 cases (1502 adults and 1948 children) during the 3rd week of 2019, bringing the total to 8498 cases to date.

In addition, 3 additional measles fatalities were reported last week [week of Mon 14 Jan 2019], bring the death count to 5. The highest rates of morbidity are seen in Lviv (a total of 1559 people: 544 adults and 1015 children), Rivne (827: 257 adults and 570 children), Vinnitsa (813: 341 adults and 472 children), Khmelnytsky (629: 332 adults and 279 children) and Kyiv (673: 356 adults and 317 children).

The Ministry of Health of Ukraine initiated extraordinary measures to protect against measles. In January [2019], in Lviv region, a special operation was launched to raise the level of immunization of children aged 6-18 who missed scheduled vaccinations for any reason. Emergency measures for the immunization of children, which will begin in schools of Lviv region in the 2nd half of February, are also planned in other regions of Ukraine.

[4] Poland (Warsaw) and Germany (Berlin)
Date: Tue 22 Jan 2019
Source: Daily Mail [edited]
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-6619981/Berlin-Warsaw-struck-evolved-outbreak-measles-researchers-fear.html


Berlin and Warsaw could be rocked by an aggressive outbreak of measles in the coming years, scientists fear. Researchers claim the capital cities of Germany and Poland share similarities to the Dutch Bible Belt (DBB) in the Netherlands. There have been large measles outbreaks almost every 12 years in the area, home to thousands of Orthodox Protestants. There are low vaccination rates in the DBB and high rates of measles in adults, which is when the infection is more dangerous.

Experts in Poland have warned low vaccination rates can also be found in Berlin and Warsaw, as well as "other urban places." Both cities, home to millions, also have high immigration levels, a risk factor because vaccination rates can be much lower among some migrant communities.

The Jagiellonian University Medical College team, led by Dr Bartosz Lisowski, warned the virus is constantly evolving to pose more of a threat. Writing in a journal, they warned how large-scale vaccination drives are needed to reduce the risk of humanity returning to "the Dark Ages."

"Many urban areas are like the DBB in that they have a total population of a few million and about 200 schools over which susceptible children are distributed," the team said. "As vaccination rates in the developed world are decreasing, the situation in the DBB is duplicated in other places."

"In the DBB with every subsequent measles outbreak since 1988, there have been more adult patients and concurrently more hospitalizations.

"This is a worrisome trend, and it may be what is to come on a wider scale if vaccination rates keep dropping and the developed world takes a small step back towards the Dark Ages."

The researchers added that, at the same time, viruses "will most likely evolve to make these outbreaks larger and longer lasting."

In Warsaw, where 5% of the Polish population live, there is a population of around 2million and 351 small schools.

"The anti-vaccination movement is rapidly gaining ground in Poland," the researchers wrote in the scientific journal Biosystems. "Vaccination coverage is falling at increasing speed and has recently dropped below the critical 95%."

Dr Lisowski and colleagues estimate there are around 8000 unvaccinated children of school age living in the Polish city, famous for its stunning architecture.

A large number of Warsaw's foreign residents come from Ukraine, the researchers added, where vaccination rates have dropped to 50%. As an estimate, there are 10 000 additional susceptible children coming from Ukraine on top of the already 8000 not vaccinated in Warsaw.

"The total number of susceptibles thus comes to about 18 000," Dr Lisowski and colleagues added in the report.

When were the measles outbreaks in the bible belt, and how is the Netherlands affected?
-------------------------

The DBB has a length of about 200 km [124 mi] and a width of several tens of kilometers. About 250 000 Orthodox Protestants are for the most part clustered in about 30 midsize towns.

The researchers worked out how many people were susceptible to measles in each outbreak. In 1988, there were 25 000 susceptibles in the age group 5-22 years old.

Measles outbreaks of similar duration and size occurred again in 1999 and in 2013. It is reasonable to assume that these outbreaks also started when the number of susceptibles again reached about 25 000.

The 12 years between 1988 and 2000 supplied 18 000 new susceptibles. The remaining 7000 susceptibles must originate from before 1988 and must never have been infected during the 1988 outbreak. The same arithmetic applies to the 2000-2013 period and the 2013 outbreak.

The Dutch health authorities campaign heavily to make parents vaccinate. However, there are 180 Orthodox-Protestant primary schools and 7 Orthodox-Protestant secondary schools, of which Orthodox children are commonly made to commute long distances in order to attend. This system mixes geographic boundaries and allows infected students to freely mix with others from a larger range of the DBB. All of the Orthodox-Protestant primary schools together comprise about 40 000 students.

Nowadays, it is estimated that more than 60% of children from Orthodox-Protestant households ultimately gets vaccinated. Without outbreaks for more than a decade, it is estimated that about 30% of this population is susceptible: around 12 000 unvaccinated children.

"This number is already close to the about 25 000 susceptibles that appeared to be sufficient to trigger an outbreak in the DBB," the team said. "There is an obvious course of action for Warsaw and for other Polish cities if they want to ward off outbreaks of the measles. It is imperative that they organize a large-scale effort to encourage people to get vaccinated," they added.

Berlin, with a population of 3.5million, was struck by a measles outbreak in 2015, with 1243 reported cases. The researchers again suggested the "fuel" came from children of parents who oppose vaccination. Unvaccinated immigrants and refugees from areas such as Syria and the former Yugoslavia may also have been to blame, the experts said.

The DBB, which stretches 124 miles (200 km) in length from Middelburg in the southwest to Zwolle in the east, was struck by measles in 1988, 1999, and 2013. Schooling played a large part in the spread each time, as almost every child under the age of 10 would get infected. Of the children who didn't get infected, they risk being caught out during the next outbreak, when they are an adult and are less able to fight the disease.

"Vaccine hesitancy" has been listed by the World Health Organization as one of the top threats to global health in 2019. [See ProMED-mail Measles update (05): vaccine hesitancy, WHO, Asia, Americas, Pacific 20190120.6268510 for more on vaccine hesitancy. - Mod.LK]. Under-vaccination has led to outbreaks of diseases not seen in years, including measles, whooping cough, and mumps.

According to the World Health Organization, measles has seen a 30% increase in cases around the world. Between September 2017 and August 2018, WHO reported more than 41 000 cases with 40 deaths in EU member states.
