Northern Queensland's cane industry is joining forces to combat ratoon stunting disease [RSD]. It has been known for more than 70 years, but continues to cost the industry through lost production and requires ongoing vigilance.

Sugar Research Australia's Gavin Rodman said RSD could be managed by using disease-free planting material, keeping blocks free of volunteer cane and by good machinery hygiene. "Unfortunately, some of these practices are no longer being followed religiously, which has led to a dramatic increase [in RSD]. Some areas are reporting infections in 30 per cent of blocks. It is scary. If RSD is present, there is a good chance you are losing significant yield."

Growers and contractors are encouraged to implement stringent hygiene controls and introduce clean seed to help minimise the spread of RSD.

[RSD of sugar cane is caused by the bacterium _Leifsonia xyli_ ssp. _xyli_ (previously _Clavibacter xyli_ ssp. _xyli_). It has only been reported from _Saccharum officinarum_ (the species grown commercially) and is considered one of the most important diseases affecting sugar cane production worldwide. Symptoms may include irregular stunting and general loss of vigour similar to the effects of external stresses, or some leaf necrosis in highly susceptible cane cultivars. Internal symptoms of nodal discolouration may be present, but do not develop adequately in all cane varieties. Thus, reliable diagnosis can be performed only by microscopy or molecular techniques. RSD can cause yield losses without an infection being noticed in the crop, and therefore disease incidence is often underestimated.

The pathogen is spread with contaminated planting setts and contaminated cutting tools. Several consecutive hot water treatments can be used to eliminate the pathogen from cuttings to set up disease-free nurseries for planting material. However, disease management must then include strict phytosanitary measures (as mentioned above) to minimise re-infection in the nursery and in the field. Some tolerant cane varieties are available, but they still support growth of the bacteria and therefore do not eliminate the disease from the area.
