Asian Tiger Mosquitoes Reach California
-----------------------------------------
LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A type of mosquito known to carry disease in Asia has
been introduced into Southern California, arriving in shipments of an
increasingly popular plant called "lucky bamboo." There have been no
documented cases of disease in the United States transmitted by Asian tiger
mosquitoes [_Aedes albopictus_, but viruses carried by the insects have
caused serious infections in Asia [principally dengue fever. - Mod.JW
Lucky bamboo resembles bamboo but is not a member of the bamboo family.
Considered a symbol of good luck, it's often used in decorating by
practitioners of feng shui, the Chinese art of arranging objects to enhance
positive forces. Lucky bamboo shipped to the United States arrives packed
in water, where mosquitoes can breed. Pest control officials were alerted
to the problem last week, when mosquitoes flew out of a shipment from South
China as agricultural inspectors opened it at the Port of Los Angeles.
On Tuesday, researchers with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
identified the insects as tiger mosquitoes, which had not been seen before
on the West Coast. So far, the insect has been found only in Los Angeles.
But ports in San Francisco, Seattle, New York and New Jersey also receive
shipments of the plant, & lucky bamboo from those shipments is sent all
over the country. "Within the last year or so it just took off," said Tony
Yung, co-owner of a Los Angeles-based company that imports lucky bamboo.
About a year and a half ago, producers started delivering lucky bamboo by
ship rather than airplane to increase volume and cut costs. Lucky bamboo
sent by sea must be stored in about 2 inches of water for about 2 weeks in
cargo containers. The containers are "the perfect breeding ground for
mosquitoes" because of the way the temperature is controlled, said Mir
Mulla, a mosquito researcher at the University of California, Riverside.
Crews are spraying pesticide into containers of bamboo shipped into Los
Angeles. But long-term solutions must come from places where the shipments
originate, including China, Thailand and Malaysia.

[_Aedes albopictus_ has been imported into the USA, principally in used
vehicle tires, for more than 10 years -- it was spotted in Ohio in 1987, &
has also been found in Florida, Pennsylvania & Texas as mentioned in the
references above, & also New York state -- no doubt our readers will send
us references to its occurrence in other states as well. Last year (2000)
West Nile virus was isolated from this species collected in Pennsylvania
(see refs. above), so it is clearly capable of mischief. - Mod.JW
[Background information on _Aedes albopictus_ from the CDC Division of
Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases is available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/arbor/albopic_new.htm>. When this document
was written, the mosquito had been identified in 866 counties in 26 states
in the continental U.S as well as in a number of other countries in the
western hemisphere.
A map, available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/arbor/images/ALBOPIC_97.gif>, gives the
distribution of _Aedes albopictus_ by U.S. county, 1985-1997. It may be
that one of our readers has more recent data. - Man. Ed. DS
