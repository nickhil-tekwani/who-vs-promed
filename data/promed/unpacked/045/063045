A highly contagious disease threatening the future of Britain's
endangered white-clawed crayfish has broken out, the Environment
Agency (EA) said today [22 Oct 2007].

Hundreds of dead crayfish have been found in the River Waveney, near
Beccles, over recent weeks.

Amanda Elliott, spokeswoman for the EA, said tests today confirmed an
outbreak of _Aphanomyces astaci_, commonly known as crayfish plague.
Measures are now being put in place to try to prevent any spread,
particularly to rivers populated by the British white-clawed
crayfish. Ms Elliott said: "The affected animals are Turkish crayfish
[_Astacus leptodactylus_, also known as the narrow-clawed crayfish,
an introduced species, which has become established in the UK. -
Mod.AS]. What we [are] most concerned about is preventing the disease
spreading to another river system. "Luckily, there are no British
white-clawed crayfish recorded in the River Waveney."

River users are being urged to thoroughly clean equipment before
using it in other waterways, she added.

[The causative agent of crayfish plague, _Aphanomyces astaci_, is a
member of a group of organisms commonly known as the water moulds.
Although long regarded to be fungi, this group -- the Oomycetida --
are not members of the Eumycota and are now classified with diatoms
and brown algae in a group called the Stramenopiles or Chromista. For
further information on crayfish plague please refer to chapter 2.3.7.
