----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) caused by _Cassava brown streak virus [CBSV] and _Ugandan cassava brown streak virus_ [UCBSV] is one of the most important diseases affecting cassava in East and Central Africa. CBSD caused by UCBSV was officially reported for the 1st time from eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in 2012 [see ProMED-mail post 20130508.1698543]. DRC is on the "front" of the westward-spreading pandemic of CBSD. If CBSV was to be reported from DRC, this increased diversity of CBSD-causing viruses would increase the threat posed by the disease and make management more difficult.

In 2016, cassava fields were inspected in Ituri province. A total of 360 leaf samples were collected from 36 fields. Root necrosis and leaf symptoms consistent with CBSD were observed on both local and improved varieties. 11 of the 36 fields were affected by CBSD, and average incidence in affected fields was 90.3%. CBSV- and UCBSV-specific real-time PCR was performed to identify the species associated with the infections.

Of the 360 samples, 108 tested positive for cassava brown streak ipomoviruses. Species-level identifications using real-time PCR on a subset of positive samples revealed that 55% had mixed UCBSV + CBSV infections, whereas 45% were only infected by UCBSV. There were no single CBSV infections. From 8 PCR products, a phylogenetic tree was generated [which] showed that 2 new sequences from Ituri clustered with CBSV isolates from previously published data [and] shared 97% identity with a CBSV isolate from Uganda. UCBSV isolates identified in this study showed a high level of homology (99%) to isolate Ug_23 from Uganda.

To our knowledge, this is the 1st report confirming the occurrence of both UCBSV and CBSV in the north-eastern part of DRC. It confirms the continued westward spread of the viruses that threaten cassava production in central and West Africa.

[Cassava brown streak disease (CBSD; also called root rot) can be caused by _Cassava brown streak virus_ (CBSV) and the more recently identified _Ugandan cassava brown streak virus_ (UCBSV; both genus _Ipomovirus_). It is considered a threat to the whole of sub-Saharan Africa, where the crop is a major factor in food security. Symptoms may include leaf chlorosis, stem necrosis, and yellow/brown corky necrosis in the starch-bearing tissue of roots. Leaves may appear healthy even when the roots have rotted away. Total crop losses of 20 to 80% have been reported, and losses in individual root weight of up to 70% have been observed in susceptible cultivars.

The viruses are transmitted by the whitefly vector _Bemisia tabaci_ (a serious crop pest in its own right) and are spread to new areas by infected cassava cuttings. Disease management includes pathogen exclusion, removal of infected plants, use of virus-free seed tubers for planting and vector control. However, these measures may be difficult to implement in developing countries. Resistant varieties are being developed for specific local requirements.

Recent outbreaks of CBSD appear to indicate a westward spread of the viruses (ProMED-mail post 20130508.1698543). CBSV is a particular threat to new crop varieties developed with resistance to cassava mosaic disease (CMD; caused by a number of species and strains in the genus _Begomovirus_ and transmitted like CBSV). A new CBSV strain adapted to higher altitudes has emerged in eastern Africa and is affecting additional CMD-resistant cultivars (ProMED-mail posts 20100525.1735 and 20120706.1191742). Joint management of both diseases has become a major challenge in the region and globally (ProMED-mail post 20110829.2643).

Recent identification of alternative hosts from unrelated plant families for CBSV and UCBSV (ProMED-mail post 20181223.6221346 and see link below) indicate that reservoir hosts may have an impact on the epidemiology of CBSD. For CMD, at least one of the viruses (_African cassava mosaic virus_; ACMV) has also been found in an unrelated alternative host (soybean).

The report above does not clarify whether symptoms due to the coinfections of both viruses are different and/or more severe (synergistic) compared to infections by one of the viruses alone. Investigating the possible interactions of the viruses in the same host may provide further information for disease epidemiology and physiological mechanisms in affected host plants.
