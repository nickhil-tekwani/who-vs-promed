[Though the current event reportedly started on 5 Sep 2018, in view of its 1st 2 outbreaks genotyped O/ME/Panasia-2 it may be viewed as a continuation of the previous FMD event which started in north eastern Israel in early April 2018 (20180410.5737736), considered as resolved in August 2018 (20180822.5980402). The virus strain behind this event was genotyped as O/ME-SA/PanAsia-2(QOM-15) (20180607.5843979).

Though the trivalent (O,A,Asia1) FMD vaccine applied in Israel includes 4 serotype O strains (O Manisa, O-3039, O-4625, O Israel 2007) it seems that their combined coverage is not sufficient to fully protect grazing beef cattle. This strain has also demonstrated its pathogenicity in wild ruminants (captive deer, wild gazelles) and wild boar. The latter animal species is of particular interest, being very prolific FMD virus amplifiers, becoming a potential source of airborne virus spread which, in certain weather and surface conditions, may reach relatively long distance. Dense populations of wild boar roam on both sides of Israel's borders with Lebanon and Syria as well as north west Jordan (along the Jordan river). It will not be surprising if FMD is found to be currently circulating in south Lebanon and south west Syria. - Mod.AS
