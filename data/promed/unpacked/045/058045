PASTEURELLA PNEUMONIA, BIG HORN SHEEP - USA (2)
===============================================

This message is in response to the reported outbreak of Pasturella
hemolytica pneumonia in Big Horn Sheep in WA, near OR and ID.

P. hemolytica often causes pneumonia after an initial stress or disease
has weakened the host's immune system. I agree that the stress of capture
and confinement of the 72 treated sheep could have created the conditions
for P. hemolytica to cause clinical pneumonia. But didn't the sheep
captured already appear sick? I was curious - has anyone investigated a
possible insult in the field which would have made the affected herd more
susceptible to the development of P. hemolytic pneumonia?

Thanks,
Courtney Woodside

[- Among the 72 recovered sheep were a significant percentage that were
ill, presumeably with the original Ps.haemolytica infection. This batch
were treated on arrival at Caldwell, presumeably successfully as this
bacterium is not subsequently reported. The subsequent health problem
have been with Ps.multocida.

Bill Foreyt has corrected an error of mine. The 72 sheep were recovered
on Dec 2nd, 3rd, and 12th. In the later multiple deaths from Ps.multocida,
secondary diagnoses of coccidia infections, scabies (Psoroptic mange),
and lungworms (Protostrongylus spp) were noted.
