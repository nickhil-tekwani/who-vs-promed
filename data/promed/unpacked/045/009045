Castleberry's Food Company has closed its production facility in
Augusta, Georgia, after 16 cans of chili sauce tested positive for
botulism over the weekend [21-22 Jul 2007], company officials said
Mon 23 Jul 2007. In addition, the company has hired an outside firm
to visit more than 8500 retailers around the country in an effort to
quickly get recalled products off store shelves.
So far, 4 cases of botulism have been reported -- 2 from Indiana and
2 from Texas. All 4 people consumed Hot Dog Chili Sauce Original, a
product made by Castleberry's.
On Sat 21 Jul 2007, Castleberry's expanded its recall of canned meat
products that may be connected to a botulism outbreak. It recalled
more than 80 types of canned chili, beef stew, corned beef hash, and
other meat products in addition to the 10 brands it had recalled 19 Jul 2007.
Company officials said they were working closely with the FDA (US
Food & Drug Administration) and the USDA (US Department of
Agriculture) to determine just how widespread the problem is, but
they could not provide information about what quantity of the
products in question are still on store shelves.
"So that we can devote all available resources to this investigation,
we agreed to shut down our entire facility in Augusta. We will not
process any more food there until the FDA and the USDA agree it is
appropriate to reopen," said Dave Melbourne, senior vice president
for Castleberry's. "And, we have stopped all further product
distribution from our centers."
Typically, commercially canned foods are heated long enough and to
high enough temperatures to kill the spores. Melbourne confirmed that
the botulism occurred in the chili sauce because the product was
undercooked. Out of caution, the company decided to recall all other
products produced on that particular production line.

The FDA is expanding its 18 Jul 2007 warning to consumers. This
expansion is for consumers and pet owners regarding canned food
products and dog food produced by Castleberry Food Company of
Augusta, GA, due to the risk of botulinum toxin. Castleberry is
expanding the recall to include all of the following canned products
with all "best by" and code dates, and FDA is warning consumers not
to purchase or eat any of the canned products listed in the table below.

The agency is expanding its warning based in part on FDA test results
and information obtained during a joint FDA and USDA inspection of
the Castleberry's facility in Augusta, GA.
Exposure to botulinum toxin can be fatal and 2 people in Texas and 2
people in Indiana remain seriously ill and hospitalized with botulism
poisoning associated with eating Castleberry's Hot Dog Chili Sauce.
While the previous recall and the known illnesses are linked to
production dates of 30 Apr to 22 May 2007, the firm has extended the
recall to include all products listed irrespective of "best by" date.
The firm is cooperating with FDA in the recall of these products and
has ceased processing and distribution.
In addition, Castleberry is recalling other products containing meat,
which are regulated by the USDA. USDA is also warning the public not
to eat certain brands of Castleberry products containing meat. The
list of these USDA-regulated products can be viewed at this link to
the USDA website
<http://www.fsis.usda.gov/News_&_Events/Recall_033_2007_expanded/index.asp>.
Consumers who have any of these products or any foods made with these
products should throw them away immediately. Double bag the cans in
plastic bags that are tightly closed then place in a trash receptacle
for non-recyclable trash outside of the home. Additional instructions
for safe disposal can be found at

The disease has only been seen occasionally in dogs and has not been
reported in cats. Ferrets are highly susceptible to botulinum toxin.
The incubation period can be 2 hours to 2 weeks; in most cases, the
symptoms appear after 12 to 24 hours. Botulism is characterized by
progressive motor paralysis. Typical clinical signs may include
muscle paralysis, difficulty breathing, chewing, and swallowing;
visual disturbances and generalized weakness may also occur. Death
usually results from paralysis of the respiratory or cardiac muscles.
Pet owners who have used these products and whose pets have these
symptoms should contact their veterinarian immediately. At this time
we are not aware of pet illnesses associated with these products
although we recommend that all these products be discarded.
