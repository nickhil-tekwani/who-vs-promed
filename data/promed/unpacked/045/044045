The Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit is renewing its call for patients of an Orillia dental clinic to get tested for hepatitis C. The health unit says 2 people, including a child, have tested positive for hepatitis C. The patients were tested after an advisory was issued in February [2018] about [this dentist's] practice. The health unit issued the advisory over concerns about equipment cleaning and sterilization.

"We're more concerned than we were in February [2018]. What we know is these individuals received dental care there and received these unexpected hepatitis results," says Dr. Colin Lee, associate medical officer of health. However, Lee adds "there is no certainty on where these 2 individuals contracted hepatitis C."

The health unit inspected the clinic in December 2017 after receiving a complaint. The office remains open, but [the dentist] was not there on [Tue 19 Jun 2018].

"It is deeply irresponsible for the health unit to suggest that dental work is in any way related to the hepatitis C status of anyone when they have no reason to believe there is any correlation between a health status and dental work," [the dentist] said in a statement. [He] maintains he has met or exceeded protocols set out by the Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario. He says the health unit never had access to the clinic's list of patients. "Making it impossible for them to verify whether the individuals referenced are even, in fact, patients of [this dentist] or received treatment at the clinic," the statement reads.

The health unit isn't able to confirm how many patients have been tested overall. They say the risk of infection remains low, but stress anyone who was a patient between January 2012 and December 2017 get tested for hepatitis B, C and HIV.

[No information is given regarding when the 2 cases were diagnosed and when the dental care was allegedly given. Likewise, it is not clear if any systematic approach has been attempted to screen other patients for hepatitis C and other blood/body fluid transmitted infections. One important step would be to compare the genetic makeup of the virus from the 2 individuals to see how related they are. Even if they are not, issues with infection control can relate to more than one source so the cases can have resulted from different primary sources. - Mod.LL
