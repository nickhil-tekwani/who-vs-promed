The following is the latest updated report on Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic
fever (CCHF) in Iran, issued by the Arboviruses and Viral Haemorrhagic
Fevers Laboratory (National Center) of the Pasteur Institute of Iran, in
Tehran, for the period 1 Jan to 31 May 2006. This supplements our last
report posted on ProMED-mail on 26 Feb 2006 as "Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic
Fever, 2005- Iran 20060226.0627."
From 1 Jan to 31 May 2006, the total number of suspected cases of CCHF was
44. Among the 44 suspected cases from different provinces of Iran, we found
15 IgM positive, RT-PCR positive cases; 4 IgM positive, RT-PCR negative
cases (the serum sample had been collected late, hence the RT-PCR result
was negative); and 2 IgM negative, RT-PCR positive cases (they suffered
fulminating illnesses and died before they could develop any immune
response). So we had a total of 21 (15+4+2) confirmed cases with 2 deaths
among the confirmed cases. The most affected province is Sistan-Baluchestan
province in southeast Iran.
It should be mentioned that for some of the biological reagents used in
serological survey, such as antigens and immune ascites, we have had
scientific assistance from the Pasteur Institutes of Paris and Dakar. (The
recombinant antigen used in ELISA tests has been produced as a scientific
collaboration between our lab and the Unite Postulante de
Genetique Moleculaire des Bunyavirides of the Pasteur Institute of Paris).
And also, for different aspects of our molecular survey, we have had
scientific collaborations with the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease
Control, the Canadian Science Center for Human and Animal Health (Winnipeg,
Canada), and the University of Texas Medical Branch (Galveston).
