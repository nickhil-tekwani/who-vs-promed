The Nigerian government has confirmed the outbreak of African swine fever
in the country which is said to be capable of wiping out entire pig
population. The outbreak of the disease was first reported in Lagos and
Ogun states a few weeks ago and officials of Nigerian Agriculture Ministry
confirmed Sunday that there had been outbreaks in Kaduna, Benue and Osun
states. A statement issued by the ministry in capital Abuja said that the
disease is now spreading fast in the West African country, warning that
meat of affected pigs is not good for human consumption, The Guardian
reported Monday.
"There is no known cure of infected pigs nor vaccine available to protect
surviving animals through vaccination," it said, adding that the only
method of control is to enforce "very strict movement of pigs and pig
products". Usually, the virulent disease leads to high mortality rate of
between 80 and 100 percent.
