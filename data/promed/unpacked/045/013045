Context: Malaria has been increasing globally, and epidemics tend to occur
when weather conditions favor this vector-borne disease. Long-term
meteorologic forecasting using El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) may
assist in anticipating epidemics and targeting scarce resources.
Objective: To determine whether malaria epidemics in Venezuela are related
to ENSO and rainfall and to determine whether such a relationship could be
used to predict outbreaks.
Design: Retrospective analysis of national malaria morbidity (1975-1995)
and mortality (1910-1935) data in the coastal zone and interior of
Venezuela in relation to El Nino events and rainfall.
Main Outcome Measure: Correlation between malaria mortality and morbidity
and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the Eastern Tropical Pacific, a
parameter of ENSO.
Results: Malaria mortality and morbidity have increased by an average of
36.5% (95% confidence interval, 3.7%-69.3%; P=.004) in years following
recognized El Nino events. A moderate correlation was found between Pacific
tropical SST during a Nino event and malaria 1 year later (r=0.50, P<.001).
Malaria mortality is more strongly related to drought in the year preceding
outbreaks than to rainfall during epidemic years.
Conclusions: Historic and recent data from Venezuela demonstrate that
malaria increases by an average of about one third in the year following a
El Nino event; change in malaria risk can be predicted from Pacific SSTs in
the previous year. Therefore, the occurrence of an El Nino event may help
predict malaria epidemics in this part of South America.
