Valley fever cases jump 50% in Pima
------------------------------------
By Carla McClain
ARIZONA DAILY STAR
As housing construction tears up more desert on the fringes of Tucson, one
result has been steadily rising cases of the lung infection known as valley
fever, say public health officials.
Valley fever [Coccidiomycosis, which is caused by the dimorphic fungus
_Coccidioides immitis_ cases jumped 50 percent in Pima County last year 
fueling an overall 30 percent rise in the disease statewide, according to
figures just released by the state health department. That increase is
occurring overwhelmingly in Arizona's urban counties  Pima and Maricopa,
and more recently Pinal  where two major risk factors, construction and
older populations, are concentrated. Found only in three Southwestern
states  Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, as well as Southern California
[Actually, the disease is also found in other areas of the Lower Sonoran
Life Zone, including parts of Nevada, and Utah in the U.S., and northern
Mexico. There are also endemic foci in Guatemala, Honduras, Venezuela,
Paraguay, Colombia, and Argentina. -DS  valley fever, known medically as
coccidioidomycosis, is caused by a fungus in the desert soil. People become
infected when they breathe in the fungal spores that become airborne when
the soil is disturbed.
"It's just construction and all that goes with it that's stirring up dust
where there used to be desert," said Stacie Marshall, epidemiologist for
the Pima County Health Department.
"Some are saying this (increase) is due to the weather last year, the heavy
summer monsoon, but we saw a jump in cases in every single month of the
year, not just after the rains. So I think it's more than that. It has a
lot to do with people moving farther and farther out into the desert 
especially new people who have never been exposed to the fungus, and older
people, who are more vulnerable to it," Marshall said.
Last year, 396 valley fever cases were reported in Pima County, up
significantly from 270 cases reported the year before  the largest rate of
increase in the state. Maricopa County saw a 30 percent increase from 1998
to 1999, from 1,015 to 1,309 cases. And Pinal County reported just over a
10 percent increase, from 80 cases in 1998 to 89 last year. Despite the
high numbers in these three counties, valley fever cases may actually be
underreported by as much as 50 percent, said state epidemiologist Ken Komatsu.
"I think the cases that are reported are only the most serious  when
people have to see a doctor and be tested," he said. "Most people are not
that badly affected, and they are rarely counted."
In about 60 percent of all cases, the infection is so mild [subclinical
infection that people are often unaware they have the disease. Experts
believe almost everyone who moves here does become infected, usually within
the first three years of arrival. But most suffer few or no symptoms, then
develop immunities against it, and are protected from re-infection. The 40
percent who do have symptoms can suffer fever, night sweats, chest pain,
cough, loss of appetite, and muscle and joint aches within one to three
weeks of infection. Most people do recover fully, but some are plagued by
fatigue and aches for as long as a year. In the worst cases, valley fever
can spread from the lungs into the skin, bones, brain or other organs [such
as the meninges, causing meningitis and can be life-threatening, requiring
anti-fungal therapy.
Valley fever rates are highest among the elderly, striking 88 out of
100,000 in that population. By contrast, the rate is only about 40 out of
every 100,000 middle-aged Arizonans.
Pinal reports the highest rate of all counties, at 53.8 cases per 100,000
people, followed by Pima, at 46.8. Maricopa comes in third, with 44.9
cases. Statewide, valley fever strikes 40.6 out of every 100,000 people. In
addition to age, desert construction and new residents from outside the
Southwest, other factors blamed for the increase include more
immunosuppressed people  those with organ transplants, cancer and HIV 
and better reporting of the disease, health officials said.
At least part of the steep rise in valley fever seen in Arizona since the
mid-'90s may be due to new rules requiring that test results be reported
directly to state and county health departments by laboratories, rather
than through physicians. "We don't have to wait anymore for doctors to get
around to it," Marshall said.
