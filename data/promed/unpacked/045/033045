A fresh outbreak of Lassa fever has killed 17 people and left dozens
infected in northern Nigeria's Kebbi State in the past month, a
health official said on Tuesday [18 May 2010]. "We have so far lost
17 people to the Lassa fever outbreak, which started about 4 weeks
ago," state chief epidemiologist Shehu Mohammed told AFP [Agence France-Press].

Lassa fever is an endemic acute viral haemorrhagic illness common in
west Africa, which is usually contracted through contact with
rodents' excreta. "Scores of people have been confirmed to have been
infected with the disease," said Mohammed in a phone interview. He
said the outbreak was recorded in 3 local districts, including the
state capital Birnin-Kebbi, the worst hit with 9 recorded deaths.

Mohammed said the World Health Organisation has roped in medical
experts from South Africa, Netherlands and Nigeria's commercial
centre Lagos to help tackle the outbreak. The disease, which causes
fever, headache, difficulty in swallowing and can lead to infection
of vital organs and death, is named after the town of Lassa in
northern Nigeria's Borno State where it was 1st identified in 1969.

It occurs mainly in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and in Sierra Leone,
where it claims roughly 200 lives each year.

[Lassa viral haemorrhagic fever is an acute illness of 1-4 weeks
duration that occurs in West Africa. Though 1st described in the
1950s, the virus causing the disease was not identified until 1969.
The virus is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the virus
family _Arenaviridae_. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Guinea,
Liberia, Sierra Leone and parts of Nigeria but probably exists in
other West African countries as well.

About 80 percent of human infections are asymptomatic; the remaining
cases have severe multi-system disease, where the virus affects
several organs in the body, such as the liver, spleen and kidneys.
The incubation period of Lassa fever ranges from 6-21 days. The onset
of the disease is usually gradual, starting with fever, general
weakness, and malaise. After a few days, headache, sore throat,
muscle pain, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, cough, and
abdominal may follow. Severe cases may progress to show facial
swelling, fluid in the lung cavity, bleeding from mouth, nose, vagina
or gastrointestinal tract, and low blood pressure. Protein may be
noted in the urine. Shock, seizures, tremor, disorientation, and coma
may be seen in the late stages. Deafness occurs in 25 percent of
patients of whom half recover some function after 1-3 months.
Transient hair loss and gait disturbance may occur during recovery.

Lassa fever is a zoonotic disease. The animal reservoir of Lassa
virus is a rodent of the genus _Mastomys_, commonly known as the
"multimammate rat." _Mastomys_ infected with Lassa virus do not
become ill, but they can shed the virus in their urine and faeces.
(An image of a multimammate rat can be viewed at:
<http://www15.bni-hamburg.de/bni/bni2/neu2/getfile.acgi?area=forschunggruppen&pid=21232>).

Lassa fever occurs in all age groups. Persons at greatest risk are
those living in rural areas where _Mastomys_ are usually found,
especially in areas of poor sanitation or crowded living conditions.
There is no epidemiological evidence supporting airborne spread
between humans. Person-to-person transmission occurs in both
community and health care settings.

The virology of Lassa fever infections has recently been reviewed by
Charrel RN, de Lamballerie X; Vet Microbiol. 2010 Jan
27;140(3-4):213-20. Epub 2009 Aug 28). "To date, the International
Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses recognizes that the family
_Arenaviridae_ contains a unique genus _Arenavirus_ that includes 22
viral species. (There are 9 additional arenaviruses that either have
been discovered recently, or which taxonomic status remains pending).
Arenaviruses have been classified according to their antigenic
properties into 2 groups, the Lassa-Lymphocytic choriomeningitis
(LCM) serocomplex and the Tacaribe serocomplex, which has been
further divided into 4 evolutionary lineages. Each arenavirus is more
or less tightly associated with a mammal host. The distribution of
the host dictates the distribution of the virus. Humans may become
infected by arenaviruses through direct contact with infected
rodents, including bites, or through inhalation of infectious rodent
excreta and secreta. Lassa, Junin, Machupo, Guanarito, and Sabia
viruses are known to cause a severe hemorrhagic fever, in western
Africa, Argentina, Bolivia, Venezuela, and Brazil, respectively.
Infection by LCM virus can result in acute central nervous system
disease, congenital malformations, and infection in organ
transplantation recipients. Detection of arenaviruses in their animal
host can be achieved by virus isolation, and has recently taken
advantage of PCR-based techniques."
