I have the following comments on the letter posted Tuesday, 5 May 1998 by
Ross Tancred concerning trichinellosis control in horses from Australia.
The EU requirement to test horse meat for _Trichinella_ is not old fashioned
but was settled when two huge outbreaks involving more than one thousand
patients and killing five of them, occurred in France in 1985 (1).
>From 1974 to 1998, twelve outbreaks related to horse meat consumption,
involving more than 2800 individuals in urban areas, have been described in
France and Italy (2). The last outbreaks occurred simultaneously in these
two countries in March 1998 and involved around one hundred patients each;
in both cases, Trichinella larvae were found in horse meat consumed by the
patients. Trichinella isolates were obtained for 9 of the 12 outbreaks: 6
were identified as domestic _T. spiralis_, 3 as sylvatic isolates (_T.
britovi_ and T5). Five species of Trichinella are known so far: _T.
spiralis_, _T. nativa_, _T. britovi_, _T. nelsoni_ and _T. pseudospiralis_
(3).
The main questions about these horse meat related outbreaks concern the
factors allowing transmission from horses to man: mode of horse infection,
veterinary control, consumers habits.
a) Horses can be experimentally infected by ingestion of infected meat (4).
This can also occur naturally with farmers feeding horses with pork offals
or by accidental ingestion of infected rats, rodents or small carnivores
ground up with hay or food. An American horse breeder reported to us finding
minced rabbit or rats carcasses in hay cut up as food (2). Other modes of
infection have been reported for other mammals species: rodents can be
infected by ingestion of carnivorous insects; pigs raised under cages
harbouring recently infected or reinfected foxes or rats can be infected by
contaminated faeces (2, 6). However, the low number of larvae which could be
transmitted by these routes could be too small to give dangerous horse meat:
in experimental infections 5000 larvae of _T. spiralis_ given to a horse,
produced a few larvae in 10 grams of muscles (4). It is generally assumed
that meat is dangerous when harbouring at least one larva per gram. However
a concomitant immunosuppression of the horse (infectious diseases,
corticosteroid injections ...) could increase the parasitic burdens.
b) From 1985, when veterinary control of Trichinella in horse meat became
compulsory, to 1994, not a single carcass was found positive though millions
have been examined and in spite of this control, 5 outbreaks were reported
in the European community. However, the amount of meat required by
regulations for pooled digestion of one hundred samples, was of one gram;
after the 1993 outbreak, digestion of 5 to 10 grams of meat per carcasses,
was recommended. This new regulation has led to the discovery of several
naturally infected horses (5, 6). If technical problems explained the 1998
Italian outbreak, there is so far no explanation for the 1998 French
outbreak. Alternative methods such as serology were considered but are not
reliable since, in experimental infections in horses, specific antibodies
disappeared about 6 months after infection though larvae were still present
in muscles (4).
c) Horse meat outbreaks have only been reported in France & Italy, countries
where people usually eat horse meat raw or rare ("steak tartare,
carpaccio..."). These traditional habits are very difficult to modify.
Horse-meat is consumed in Europe since prehistoric times. In the middle of
the XIXth century, physicians militated for horse meat consumption : "a
cheap meat for poor classes". In 1903, Charles Richet, Nobel prize of
Medicine a few years later, claimed that raw horse meat protected against
tuberculosis. Therefore, horse meat consumption has been associated with
good health in the Italian and French populations. In 1964, 300,000 horses
were consumed in France but this consumption has now decreased (a 75%
decrease in 30 years). However, 30-40% of the French population still
routinely eat raw or rare horse meat. Recommending appropriate cooking of
horse meat would be of course the best prophylaxis but this simple
recommendation is not applicable to a portion of the Italian or French
population.
In Australia, the only species reported is _T. pseudospiralis_ whose
distribution could be restricted to Tasmania (7). However, though never
reported in horses, _T. pseudospiralis_ could potentially infect them. _T.
pseudospiralis_ was never reported in pork before an outbreak in Thailand
involving 59 individuals (8). However the suppression [cessation of control
in Australian horses could be considered only if extensive and recent
surveys in the domestic and wildlife of the region were carried out. These
interesting data could be presented during the Xth International Conference
on trichinellosis which will be organised in France in August 2000.
