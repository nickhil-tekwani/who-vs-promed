[The case] was reported by the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, after confirmation from the Directorate of Epidemiology. The patient is a worker from the rural area of southern Pampas.

The Epidemiology Directorate of the Ministry of Health of La Pampa confirmed that a suspected case of cutaneous anthrax, also known as anthrax or malignant pustule, was detected in a rural worker in the south of the province. The patient is under medical treatment and being monitored.

The information was released by the Veterinary Faculty of the UNLPam, which together with the Provincial Zoonosis Board warned that anthrax is "a serious zoonotic disease that can be transmitted from sick animals to people and its suspicion in both cases is notification mandatory."

It (the disease) is caused by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_ that can survive in the environment for more than 50 years because it has a form of resistance called a spore. "This disease is also known as anthrax, malignant pustule. The disease is transmitted from sick or dead animals to humans, but it is not spread between sick or convalescent people," the Faculty explained in a statement.

In people, depending on the route of entry of the bacteria into the body, anthrax manifests itself in different ways. In the case of cutaneous anthrax or "bad pimple," the bacteria enter through the skin, where it produces a lesion with the appearance of a pimple or sore that transforms into an ulcerative lesion surrounded by vesicles and progresses to a black eschar that does not produces pain.

In the case of animals, they present an acute death with blood coming out of the natural orifices (mouth, nose and anus). With the blood, spores are released into the environment that remain in the soil and can be ingested by other ruminants when feeding.

The prevention measures are the vaccination of the animals at risk, and it is also recommended "not to carry out the necropsy of animals suspected of anthrax to avoid the spread of spores in the environment. If the presumptive diagnosis of anthrax arises after the opening of a corpse, measures must be taken to disinfect the elements used in it, as well as the clothing and footwear of the personnel," they detailed.

They also asked [people] not to manipulate or consume products derived from animals with signs of being sick or dead, and not to burn corpses " since this practice causes the spread of spores and favors respiratory infection."

"The [carcasses] must be buried and covered in the same place where they were found, following Senasa's instructions," they detailed. "Early detection and immediate notification of anthrax cases are essential for the implementation of prevention, control and surveillance measures by the competent bodies," they insisted.

The province of La Pampa has had repeated outbreaks of bovine anthrax. The Laboratorio Santa Rosa (Dr. Fernando Esain) noted that in the 14 years since 2014 it was an important epidemiologic risk and a constant concern in provincial policy. In the period 2006-2019, they processed 669 suspect samples and 50 were confirmed to be _Bacillus anthracis_ positive.

The province is made up of 22 departments of which 11 (50%) had had outbreaks of livestock anthrax during 2016-2019. These were Atreuco, Capital, Conhelo, Guatrache, Hucal, Lihuel Calel, Loventue, Rancul, Realico, Toay, and Utracan. All are subject to compulsory vaccination in the province.

In 2020, the Santa Rosa laboratory examined 49 suspect samples of which 2 (4%) were positive. At the present time, anthrax is an endemic risk in the provinces of Rio Negro, La Pampa, and Buenos Aires.

The province is to the immediate west of Buenos Aires province and its western border abuts the hill country of the Andes foothills. For the departments of Loventue and Toay, go to https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departamento_Loventu%C3%A9 and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toay_Department. They are adjoining departments in La Pampa province.

Unfortunately, however much one fosters annual vaccination in areas of significant anthrax risk, some ranchers will put it off and then their procrastination becomes public when their animals succumb to this disease. But the only way to rid a region of anthrax is regular vaccination so that remaining spores in the soil can die and not be replaced by blood spillage from new cases. In spite of the literature, anthrax spores are not immortal and in spite of any regeneration will eventually die off. It takes anything from 3 to 8 years, plus there is a natural loss of phages so that remaining spores are apathogenic. Effective anthrax control equals anthrax eradication. Our thanks to Mahmoud and Ramon for their valuable contributions and comments. - Mod.MHJ
