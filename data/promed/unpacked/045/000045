The swine fever outbreak which killed thousands of pigs in Nairobi and
Central Province has been contained. However, a ban on pig movement
between Nairobi and Central Province is yet to be lifted, the Central
Provincial Director of Veterinary Services, Dr D. Wambugu, said.
He said the quarantine, imposed 3 weeks ago, would only be lifted after a
longer period to allow the virus causing the contagious disease to die
off. No new cases have been reported in the past 3 weeks, Dr Wambugu
said.
Farmers in the affected areas were being advised not to keep pigs until
after 6 months. Dr Wambugu added the disease is self-limiting because it
spreads very fast, and kills animals within 5 to 7 days. The disease has
no cure and visitors into the affected areas had been advised not to
venture into the farms to avoid spreading the virus. The medic said the
disease could only be controlled through proper management.
