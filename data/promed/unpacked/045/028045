FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
Subject: Embargo on Importation of _Dracaena_ Shipped in Standing Water
Date: 29 Jun 2001
On 14 Jun 2001, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was
notified by the Los Angeles district office of the U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA) that it had identified maritime cargo containers of
"lucky bamboo" (_Dracaena_ species), an ornamental plant, that were
infested with mosquitoes.
CDC subsequently identified the Asian tiger mosquito, _Aedes albopictus_, a
species previously not seen in California, and other species of mosquitoes
associated with these cargo containers. The _Dracaena_ in the infested
cargo containers was shipped in small boxes with 2-3 inches of standing
water. Shipments of _Dracaena_ with no standing water or associated
mosquito infestation have been arriving in the United States from China,
Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Costa Rica, and other countries as
air and maritime cargo for at least 3 years.
_Dracaena_ shipments in standing water appear to pose a considerable risk
of importing exotic mosquitoes into the United States. Although previously
introduced and widely established in the eastern half of the United States,
_Aedes albopictus_ has not established a population in California. The
species is capable of transmitting serious human diseases, including
western equine encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, and dengue viruses.
Introduction of new _Aedes albopictus_ populations from China, Taiwan,
Indonesia, and other countries might include genotypes that are more
efficient vectors of human diseases than the genotypes that are currently
present in the United States.
There are important public health precedents of accidental introduction of
mosquito species into the United States by a similar mechanism, i.e.,
importation of materials containing standing water. Introductions of exotic
species of mosquitoes, such as _Aedes albopictus_ in California and other
species in different parts of the United States, through the importation of
_Dracaena_ shipments in standing water, pose potentially serious public
health threats.
Accordingly, pursuant to 42 CFR 71.32(c), CDC is implementing an embargo on
the importation of _Dracaena_ shipments in standing water, effective
immediately. This embargo only affects importation of _Dracaena_ shipments
in standing water. For further information or assistance, contact:
