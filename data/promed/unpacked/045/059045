Anthrax appears to have made a comeback to Visakhapatnam Agency [Andhra Pradesh state]. As many as 6 people from Dumbriguda mandal were admitted to King George Hospital (KGH) late Sunday night [10 Sep 2017] with suspected anthrax symptoms. According to the doctors at the KGH dermatology department, 5 people approached the hospital with complaints of suspected cutaneous anthrax after a group of the villagers consumed the meat of a sick goat a few weeks ago.

"All patients have developed rashes and pustules on their hands, legs, and face. But, it's not life-threatening [it can be prevented with vaccination and can be treated with antibiotics following sample collection - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ/Mod.JH]," said B Balachandrudu, [head of department] of the KGH dermatology wing, adding that smears from the lesions and blood samples have been collected for lab testing. Now, the patients are kept in quarantine ward and being treated with antibiotics, apart from regular dressings. [Actually it is far better to start with antibiotics. - Mod.MHJ]

In June this year [2017], 5 patients from Kodupunjuvalasa village of Araku Valley [Andhra Pradesh] were confirmed positive for cutaneous anthrax and the mode of contracting infection was similar -- the victims ate meat of a goat which was already infected with _Bacillus anthracis_, the causal organism of cutaneous anthrax [see Anthrax - India (11): (AD) livestock vaccination 20170630.5142511, and 3 prior posting listed below. - Mod.MHJ]

"The cutaneous anthrax spores can thrive for more than 70 years in the soil. [Usually much shorter than that. - Mod.MHJ] The animals get the spores into their stomach while grazing. Tribal people contract infection if they eat infected meat or through cuts and abrasions in their bodies while cutting the animal flesh," says B Balachandrudu. Meanwhile, KGH superintendent G Arjuna and Andhra Medical College principal PV Sudhakar interacted with the patients.

"Blood samples of the patients will be tested at the microbiology department here. If they are tested positive, the samples will be sent to DRDE Laboratory in Gwalior [Madhya Pradesh]. According to the tribals, several animals have died in the surrounding villages due to various reasons in the last one month. We have launched a medical camp to screen the residents," said epidemiologist L Kalyan Prasad.

Vaccination programme: Animal Husbandry Department will administer vaccines to 11 000 animals including cattle, goat, and sheep in 24 villages at Dumbriguda mandal from [Tue 12 Sep 2017].

Reading between the lines of this report there are probably a number of caprine source outbreaks of human cutaneous anthrax in Visakhapatnam Agency (county) in Andhra Pradesh. And as goats are primarily browsers not grazers, there will have been a string of local caprine deaths. So it would be wise if the "Medical Camp" included a veterinarian to check for sick goats and unreported losses. Considering the frequency of livestock anthrax in Andhra Pradesh it would be wise for the Animal Husbandry Department to plan for the initiation of a proactive anthrax control and vaccination programme. Stopping livestock anthrax before it begins is far cheaper and more cost effective that emergency retroactive activities. - Mod.MHJ
