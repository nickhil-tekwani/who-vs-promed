A goat and a horse tested positive in Gadsden County [Florida] for eastern equine encephalitis last week [week of 6 Jul 2015] and health officials are linking it to an increase in mosquito activity. That increase in activity puts humans more at risk as the Florida Health Department in Gadsden County and county mosquito control monitor the insect's numbers and the prevalence of the virus.

No cases have been reported in Leon or Wakulla counties, but in 2015, positive samples have been taken from 38 sentinel chickens, 14 horses, and one goat across 19 counties, according to DOH records.

Officials are warning to take precautions to avoid being bitten.

Ways to reduce exposure to mosquitoes:
- drain standing water to stop mosquitoes from breeding;
- cover skin with long pants and long-sleeve shirts and apply repellent to exposed skin

The Florida Department of Health in Polk County has confirmed a positive case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in a horse. This is the 2nd case in the county within the past 2 weeks.

EEE can be transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito. It is a rare illness in humans, and only a few cases are reported in the United States each year. There have been no human cases of EEE in the state of Florida reported in 2015.

Residents are advised to avoid mosquito bites by taking the necessary precautions. "Avoiding mosquito bites is the key to preventing any type of mosquito-borne diseases," said Dr Ulyee Choe, director of the Florida Department of Health in Polk. "Floridians and visitors are encouraged to take precautionary measures to help reduce the chance of being bitten. Remember to drain and cover."

The health department offers the following advice for residents to avoid being bitten by mosquitos:

DRAIN standing water
--------------------
Drain standing water from garbage cans, house gutters, buckets, pool covers, coolers, toys, flower pots or any other containers where sprinkler or rain water has collected to stop mosquitoes from multiplying.
Discard old tires, drums, bottles, cans, pots and pans, broken appliances and other items that aren't being used.
Empty and clean birdbaths and pet's water bowls at least once or twice a week.
Protect boats and vehicles from rain with tarps that don't accumulate water.
Maintain swimming pools in good condition and appropriately chlorinated. Empty plastic swimming pools when not in use.

COVER skin with clothing or repellent
-------------------------------------
Wear shoes, socks, long pants, and long-sleeves.
Apply mosquito repellent to bare skin and clothing. Always use repellents according to the label. Repellents with DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus and IR3535 are effective.

COVER doors and windows with screens to keep mosquitoes out
-----------------------------------------------------------
Keep mosquitoes out of your house. Repair broken screens on windows, doors, porches, and patios.

Most people infected with EEEV have no apparent illness. Severe cases of EEE (involving encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain) begin with the sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills, and vomiting. The illness may then progress into disorientation, seizures, or coma. There is no specific treatment for EEE. If you experience symptoms of eastern equine encephalitis, consult with your health care provider and protect yourself against further mosquito bites. Avoiding mosquito bites while you are sick will help to protect others from getting infected.

[The state of can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3512991,212. For a map of the state, see http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/florida_90.jpg Polk County is in central Florida and Gadsden County is at the western end of the border with Georgia.

Unfortunately, EEE is enzootic in Florida and outbreaks, whether in animals or humans, are not unexpected. Thus, the need to take precautions, at least until you have developed a protective titre, and make sure your horses are vaccinated annually. - Mod.MHJ]
