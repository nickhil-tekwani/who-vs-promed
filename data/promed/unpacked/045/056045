South Western Sydney Local Health District Acting Public Health Director Dr Nick Rose said residents need to be "more cautious" with the high numbers of mosquitoes around the Georges River.

It comes as the health district put out a warning after mosquito trapping at Deepwater Park identified mosquitoes with Ross River virus.

Dr Rose said that while Ross River infection was relatively rare in south-west Sydney, people enjoying outdoor activities such as camping or fishing in areas with high mosquito numbers should take the proper precautions.

"There is no treatment for Ross River. The best way to protect yourself is to avoid getting bitten," he said. "The Public Health Unit continues to monitor notified cases of Ross River and other mosquito-borne virus infections. This determines the number of cases and whether the infection was acquired locally or elsewhere."

The symptoms of the Ross River virus can include tiredness, rash, fever and sore and swollen joints, typically within 3 weeks of being bitten. They can subside after several days, but some people may experience them for weeks or even months.

"People should see their doctor if they experience these symptoms," Dr Rose said.

Steps to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes:
- Avoid being outside, unprotected, when mosquitoes are commonly active at dawn and dusk. Cover up as much as possible with light-coloured, loose-fitting clothing and covered footwear.
- Apply mosquito repellent regularly to exposed areas. Repellents containing Diethyl Toluamide (DEET) or Picaridin are best.
- Don't use repellents on the skin of children under the age of 3 months. Instead use physical barriers such as netting on prams, cots and play areas for babies.
- Eradicate mosquito breeding sites around the home, including containers that hold water.
- Use flyscreens on windows and doors of houses and keep them in good order.
- When camping, use flyscreens, or sleep under mosquito nets.

[Ross River virus (RRV) transmission was active in 2018 and now is showing up in a new locality in the state in 2019. In 2018, there were 9 official notifications of Ross River virus cases in NSW Between 28 Oct-3 Nov 2018 and 11 in the previous week. 512 cases were reported in the state all of 2018.

Common symptoms of Ross River virus infection include fever, joint pain, and feeling tired and generally unwell. There are no effective treatments available for RRV. While most people recover after 2-3 weeks, some cases are very serious and can leave lingering problems such as arthritis in small joints, like those in the hands and feet, that can persist for weeks, making normal movement difficult.

Ross River virus is a zoonotic alphavirus transmitted by a wide range of mosquitoes, including _Aedes_ and _Culex_ species. The recommendations mentioned above should be adopted by individuals living in or visiting hot spots where transmission is occurring.
