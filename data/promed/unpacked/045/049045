Malaria epidemic in Assam, India
--------------------------------
The death toll in a malaria epidemic sweeping the northeastern Indian state
of Assam has risen to 50, and more than 4500 others are suffering from the
disease, officials said Tuesday.
"We have confirmed reports of 50 dead due to malaria during the past
month," said Bhumidhar Barman, Assam's health minister.The affected areas
are mostly located in western Assam, along the border with Bhutan, and in
the eastern districts that share a border with the adjoining states of
Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland.
At least 102 people died of malaria in the state last year. This is not the
final figure, as a number of deaths in far-flung areas go unreported, a
fact admitted by health authorities. Barman said the absence of medical
doctors and health workers in the remote areas was a major reason for the
high death rate.
Voluntary agencies like the International Federation of the Red Cross have
also contributed medicine. "The situation is grave," said Renuka Devi
Borkakoty, head of the Indian Red Cross Society's Assam branch. "The IFRC
has rushed anti-malarial drugs which we handed over to local health
officials."
Large parts of Assam, a state of 26 million people, are prone to outbreaks
of malaria particularly during the monsoon rains. A federal scheme to
combat the disease, known as the National Anti-Malaria Program, involves
free distribution of insecticide-treated mosquito nets among the rural poor
hit by the menace.
Officials said 100 000 such medicated mosquito nets were distributed free
of cost last year in different parts of Assam. An additional 150 000 such
mosquito nets will be distributed this year, officials say.

[While malaria is definitely endemic to Assam, the situation is unstable
and outbreaks occur from time to time. In the present news report, the
number of deaths due to malaria is given as approximately 50 compared to
about 120 for the entire year 2000. - Mod.EP
