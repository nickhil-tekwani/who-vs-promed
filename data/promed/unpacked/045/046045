Twenty days after suffering a leg injury while wind surfing, a
previously healthy female athlete presented to St Paul's Hospital
(Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) with profound myalgia and
shortness of breath. Within 24 hours of admission, she developed
progressive multi-organ failure and was admitted to the intensive care
unit (ICU) with severe sepsis secondary to methicillin-resistant
_Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) bacteremia. Her course in the ICU has
been complicated by persistent MRSA bacteremia with seeding to
multiple sites, including eyes, urinary tract, and lungs.

The source of the bacteremia was an infected leg hematoma. All _S.
aureus_ isolates recovered from clinical samples revealed identical
antimicrobial susceptibility patterns (resistant to oxacillin;
susceptible to clindamycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole,
tetracycline, and vancomycin). Genes for the Panton-Valentine
Leukocidin (PVL) and mecA [the gene encoding methicillin-resistance]
were detected by PCR [polymerase chain reaction]. Preliminary
molecular and phenotypic studies suggest a strain of
community-associated MRSA [CA-MRSA] to be responsible for the
overwhelming sepsis.

Several months prior to the wind surfing accident, this individual had
participated in an extreme rowing event: 14 rowers embarked on a
transatlantic rowing expedition across the Northern Atlantic Ocean.
During the voyage, which lasted over 42 days, at least 9 of the 14
crew members developed extensive furuncles and carbuncles. Ultimately,
3 of the crew members developed severe infections requiring
hospitalization. Laboratory data from those who reported skin and soft
tissue infection related to the transatlantic crossing provide
preliminary evidence for CA-MRSA as the causative organism. Secondary
transmission of CA-MRSA among household members appears to have
occurred.

In response to the case of severe MRSA infection presenting to St
Paul's Hospital and the presumed outbreak of CA-MRSA on the rowing
vessel, an investigation was launched in collaboration with Vancouver
Coastal Health Communicable Disease Control. The goals of the
investigation are to determine epidemiological risk factors associated
with the development of MRSA infection among ocean rowers, including
severe disease. In addition, further microbiological and molecular
analyses are ongoing.

While CA-MRSA outbreaks have been described amongst athletes,
including competitive rowers, little is known about CA-MRSA among
athletes participating in extreme sporting events, such as ocean
rowing. Factors previously associated with CA-MRSA outbreaks, such as
damaged skin integrity, overcrowding, poor personal hygiene, and
frequent skin-to-skin contact, appear to have played a role in this
outbreak.

Based on the preliminary results of our investigation, and the
severity of CA-MRSA infections among some of the athletes who
participated in this extreme sporting event, ocean rowers should be
considered at risk for CA-MRSA.

[Rowing across the Arctic, Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans for
thousands of miles on open, rough seas has become a niche sport.
According to the Ocean Rowing Society as of June 2011, of 606 rowers
starting out, 495 rowers completed an ocean row, losing 7 rowers at
sea (http://www.oceanrowing.com/statistics/index.htm). Only 469
boats have ever been launched to cross any ocean by rowing and, of
these, 293 boats completed their voyage. Rowers are from many
different countries; most are from the UK. Rowers include both men and
women; 72 women, 13 of whom are from the USA, have rowed an ocean
successfully. The average age of an ocean rower is 36 years
(http://www.around-n-over.org/boat.htm). See
http://www.oceanrowing.com/Artemis/2010/photoalbum/index.htm for
pictures of the boats.

Methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) is a type of _S.
aureus_ that is resistant to antibiotics called beta-lactams, which
include methicillin, oxacillin, and other more common antibiotics such
as penicillin, amoxicillin, and cephalexin. MRSA have been causing
infections acquired in a healthcare facility, such as a hospital,
long-term care facility (such as a nursing home), or hemodialysis unit
for more than 40 years. The appearance of MRSA in infections acquired
outside healthcare settings is a more recent problem. Clusters of
community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) skin infections have been
documented among athletes participating in contact sports, military
recruits, Pacific Islanders, Alaskan Natives, Native Americans, men
who have sex with men, IV drug users, and prisoners.

Factors that have been associated with the spread of CA-MRSA skin
infections in otherwise healthy people include close skin-to-skin
contact, skin cuts or abrasions, contact with contaminated surfaces
(such as, gym equipment, shared towels), and poor hygiene. A rigorous
sport like ocean rowing can obviously result in multiple injuries.
Blisters, salt sores, sunburn, bruises, rashes, pulled muscles, and
swollen joints are the most common injuries that occur with ocean
rowing (http://rowforwater.com/challenge/faqs/). Damaged skin
integrity, overcrowding on small boats, poor personal hygiene, and
frequent skin-to-skin contact appear to have played a role in the
CA-MRSA outbreak among ocean rowers described in the report above.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classifies MRSA
isolates based on the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns
(currently USA100-1200) (McDougal, L et al: Pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis typing of oxacillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_
isolates from the United States: Establishing a national database. J
Clin Microbiol. 2003; 41(11): 5113-20, available at
http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/content/full/41/11/5113?view=long&pmid=14605147).
The PFGE type of CA-MRSA is not specified in the report above. USA300,
the predominant epidemic clone in numerous outbreaks in the United
States, is also increasingly seen in Canada and Europe. USA300 usually
carries the genes encoding the Panton-Valentine leukocidin, and has
caused outbreaks of skin and soft issue infection, as well as invasive
disease (such as, bacteremia, endocarditis, necrotizing pneumonia, and
osteomyelitis) in children in daycare centers, military recruits,
athletes, prison inmates, and men who have sex with men, in which the
infected, but otherwise healthy, individuals had no link to health
care systems (Tenover FC, Goering RV: Methicillin-resistant
_Staphylococcus aureus_ strain USA300: origin and epidemiology. J
Antimicrob Chemother 2009; 64(3): 441-6, available at
http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/64/3/441.full).
