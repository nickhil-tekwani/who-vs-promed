Cholera in the Comoros Islands (update) - 9 September 1998
The country, which consists of 4 islands (Grande Comore, Moheli, Anjouan
and Mayotte) has been experiencing a cholera outbreak since February 1998.
The first case was registered in Mbeni, ca. 80 km north of the capital
Moroni on Grande Comore. The disease spread soon after to other districts
including the capital. The Ministry of Health has kept WHO regularly
informed of the situation. By end-April, 1,750 cases and 31 deaths had been
reported. Most cases occurred between April and June. By mid-August, the
cumulative total for 1998 had reached 3,199 cases and 40 deaths.
WHO and other agencies, as well as several NGOs, have been involved from
the start in controlling the outbreak and preventing its spread, in close
collaboration with the Ministry of Health. Poor basic sanitation, very
limited personal and environmental hygiene and poor access to safe water
are the major contributors to the continued spread. Epidemic preparedness
plans have been set up for the surrounding islands with the support of WHO.
The first case of cholera has now been announced on the island of Mayotte.
WHO is in contact with health officials there to support immediate action
for control and prevention.
