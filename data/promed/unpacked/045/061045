[1] Italy (Rome) ex Bangladesh

Italy's health minister ordered the suspension of flights to Rome from Bangladesh on Tuesday [7 Jul 2020], after a spate of coronavirus [COVID-19] cases within the community that authorities worry could expand. On Monday [6 Jul 2020], the Lazio region surrounding Rome issued a special decree calling for passengers from Dhaka to be given virus tests upon their arrival at Rome's Fiumicino airport. Of the 225 arriving Dhaka passengers on Monday [6 Jul 2020], 21 tested positive for the disease, Lazio's top health official Alessio D'Amato said on Tuesday [7 Jul 2020], calling it a "veritable viral 'bomb' that we've defused." Health Minister Roberto Speranza said in a statement that a one-week suspension of flights had been ordered.

As of Monday [6 Jul 2020], 32 coronavirus cases had been reported within the Bangladeshi community, Lazio president Nicola Zingaretti wrote in the decree. It was unclear whether that number included the positive cases among the passengers who arrived Monday [6 Jul 2020]. 17 of the 32 cases were "imported" from abroad and 15 involved people in contact with those imported cases, the decree said. It added that a 2-week quarantine for passengers from Bangladesh had been insufficient to contain transmission of the virus.

There are currently 870 coronavirus cases in Lazio, with 14 709 in Italy overall, according to the latest official figures. Since the crisis erupted in Italy in late February [2020], 34 869 people have died of coronavirus, but the rate of new infections has slowed considerably, leading the government to roll back most lockdown restrictions. Still, Speranza has warned of a possible 2nd wave in the autumn and has cautioned Italians to wear masks and avoid crowds, among other measures.

"The objective is to prevent the outbreak that is currently seen in Rome in the Bengali community from multiplying," Francesco Vaia, health director of Rome's Spallanzani hospital, told news wire AGI. "It's essential to put under control airports, ports, and stations and activate a health surveillance on citizens coming from the non-Schengen area and in particular from countries where the virus is spreading."

Beginning last month [Jun 2020], passengers from Dhaka have arrived on special flights intended to bring Bangladeshi nationals residing in Italy back to their European homes and jobs following the coronavirus lockdown. Italy's borders are only open to those passengers coming from within Europe's Schengen zone, as well as those from another 14 countries -- a list that does not include Bangladesh.

Lazio has sought to offer more testing for the community of Bangladeshis which numbers about 30 000 in Italy's capital, but only 3 people showed up at a special clinic offering free testing on Monday [6 Jul 2020], Il Messagero daily said. ...

[A common theme emerging among countries and territories that have markedly reduced transmission within their borders is the growing proportion of cases associated with importations from countries with active transmission. Other countries/territories include China, South Korea, and Hong Kong. In the big picture this will have implications on international travel with countries shutting down flights from countries with active transmission. There is an irony here, with countries that were major exporters of the virus earlier this year (2020) now dealing with the challenge of importations.

Abstract
Since the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), unprecedented movement restrictions and social distancing measures have been implemented worldwide. The socioeconomic repercussions have fueled calls to lift these measures. In the absence of population-wide restrictions, isolation of infected individuals is key to curtailing transmission. However, the effectiveness of symptom-based isolation in preventing a resurgence depends on the extent of presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission. We evaluate the contribution of presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission based on recent individual-level data regarding infectiousness prior to symptom onset and the asymptomatic proportion among all infections. We found that the majority of incidences may be attributable to silent transmission from a combination of the presymptomatic stage and asymptomatic infections. Consequently, even if all symptomatic cases are isolated, a vast outbreak may nonetheless unfold. We further quantified the effect of isolating silent infections in addition to symptomatic cases, finding that over 1/3 of silent infections must be isolated to suppress a future outbreak below 1% of the population. Our results indicate that symptom-based isolation must be supplemented by rapid contact tracing and testing that identifies asymptomatic and presymptomatic cases, in order to safely lift current restrictions and minimize the risk of resurgence.

[This study is based on empirical modeling data and supports the key recommendations for universal wearing of masks and adherence to social distancing. It also supports the critical importance of adequate contact tracing with testing of all contacts identified irrespective of symptom status, and mandatory quarantine of all contacts for the 2 week incubation period.

In addition, based on data from a CDC study on the importance of doing serial testing during the quarantine period (see COVID-19 update (295): institutional serial testing post exposure WHO, global 20200630.7524593, section [1] USA (Louisiana): asymptomatic and presymptomatic incarcerated individuals), it would be prudent to do serial PCRs of PCR-negative asymptomatic contacts during the 14-day quarantine period rather than a single specimen to increase likelihood of detecting infection in these individuals. - Mod.MPP]

[The 7 new confirmed cases in the last 24 hours were all imported and no cases were reported from Beijing.

There were 6 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals and no new conversions from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. Since 18 May 2020, there have been 36 cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic infections reported by China.

Hong Kong reported 14 new cases. According to a Centre for Health Protection press release, "the newly reported cases announced today involve 10 males and 4 females aged between 14 and 85. 5 had travel history during the incubation period." The webpage mentions a total of 1300 cases (1299 confirmed and 1 probable case). Locally acquired cases include 1 resident of a residential care home for the elderly (RCHE), the others are considered most likely community acquired, information re possible restaurants (https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202007/07/P2020070700833.htm).

Takeaway message: China continues to have importations of infected individuals with SARS-CoV-2, many of whom are detected as asymptomatic at the time of positive PCR testing.

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 63 cases with no new deaths, compared with 44 cases and 1 new death in the previous day (6 Jul 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 85 consecutive days. There were 30 locally transmitted cases: Gyeonggi (11), Gwangju (7), Seoul (5), Chungnam (3), Daejeon (2), Incheon (1), and Jeonnam (1), and 33 imported cases -- airport quarantine (11), Gyeonggi (7), Seoul (5), Chungnam (3), Jeonbuk (2), Gyeongnam (2), Daegu (1), Gwangju (1), and Gyeongbuk (1). There were 6 provinces reporting no newly confirmed cases (compared with 10 provinces yesterday, 6 Jul 2020).

According to data from the "ncov" website of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the cumulative confirmation rate has been steady at 1.0% (http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/).

The overall impression hasn't changed: Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. But, that being said, importations are also playing a major role in the country. It would be nice to know the asymptomatic rate being detected, and the proportion of asymptomatic infections detected that go on to clinical disease.

Takeaway message: Importations continue to be a challenge, and gatherings whether social or religious are key foci for enlarging clusters (unchanged from previous 4 day's message).

Iran reported its highest number of daily deaths on Tuesday [7 Jul 2020], as health officials expressed grave concerns over an influx of COVID-19 patients. The daily count of fatalities rose to 200 on Tuesday [7 Jul 2020], up by 37 from the previous peak and the highest single-day jump on record, Health Ministry Spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari was quoted as saying by ISNA.

Health Minister Saeed Namaki said on the same day that he had "repeatedly" warned against the normalization of pandemic, calling it "one of the most dangerous approaches that could make us face an awful predicament". The minister said, "I did not want the public to pay a hefty price to be convinced to believe me." Over 2637 were diagnosed with COVID-19 during a 24-hour period, taking the national total to 245 688.

According to the ministry's spokesperson, the 200 new deaths brought the toll to 11 931. The government has raised the alarm over 20 of the country's 31 provinces.

Namaki said, "As you can recall, we pleaded with the public and those who were pushing for reopenings ... So many ignored us and now a new wave is getting us in trouble. Adherence to health protocols dropped from 85% in the early days of reopenings to below 20%," he added, asking businesses to observe the guidelines devised by his ministry.

"In the province of Tehran, compliance with hygiene protocols went from 69% to 11% in roughly a month," the head of the region's coronavirus taskforce, Alireza Zali, said. Zali reported an 8.5% rise in hospitalization across Tehran Province in recent days and said the country is facing "new circumstances" due to an exponential rise in the number of cases and the pandemic affecting all age groups this time around.

Iran has administered 1.84 million PCR tests to detect infections. Some 207 000 have recovered from the disease and 3270 are in critical condition.

Namaki noted that wearing facemasks and observing social distancing can reduce the chances of virus transmission by 80%. "Masks are one of the best ways to prevent the virus infection ... I ask people to take COVID-19 seriously and to take masks seriously," the minister said. During her daily briefing, Lari called the surge in fatalities "painful" and pleaded with people to wear facemasks.

Zali pointed out that wearing face coverings is only one of the protective strategies against the deadly outbreak. "Wearing facemasks does not solve all our problems. It might actually give people a false sense of security," Zali said. Frequent handwashing, avoiding infected patients, and preventing the free movement of those with coronavirus symptoms were among the official's solutions to the viral problem.

[As of 7 Jul 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 245 688, including 11 931 deaths, an increase of 2637 cases and 200 deaths since 6 Jul 2020. The number of daily reported cases and deaths are slowing increasing. According to the media report, 20 out of the 31 provinces are experiencing increases.

Takeaway message (unchanged): Premature lifting of restrictions is taking its toll in Iran as is elsewhere in the world.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA as per Worldometer data for the top 20 reporting entities. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 3 097 084, including 133 972 deaths, an increase from 3 040 833 cases and 132 979 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 214 371 cases as of 13:00 EDT (GMT-4) on 7 Jul 2020, including 18 611 confirmed deaths and an additional 4607 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are California, Texas, Florida, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, Tennessee, Missouri, and South Carolina. This list includes states that are showing major increases in daily cases reported beginning with the lifting of restrictions around the end of May 2020. All but one of the top 10 states reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, with the range being 982 to 10 081. In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by California, Texas, Florida, New Jersey, Illinois, Massachusetts, Arizona, Georgia, and Pennsylvania. A total of 42 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

In the past 24 hours, the proportion of newly confirmed cases was 1.8%. The 7-day average of newly confirmed cases for the past 7 days is 21.6% higher than the 7-day average for the preceding 7 days, consistent with the ongoing pandemic in the country, although slowing down over the past 7 days.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html has data on cases, hospitalization, testing, and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance, and emergency room visits, which are definitely worth reviewing, as a welcome series of analyses. According to the CDC data, the percentages of laboratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a molecular assay is 9% positive tests out of 39 011 749 tests performed, consistent with the ongoing, as yet not under control pandemic in the country (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html).

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 7 Jul 2020.

Highlights
----------
- WHO encourages Member States to invest in and build longer-term health emergency preparedness during the COVID-19 pandemic. To support this goal, WHO has published guidance that maps COVID-19 preparedness and response actions; locates relevant supporting WHO resources; and advocates for the conscious and effective allocation of COVID-19 funds to also meet countries' longer-term needs.

- A WHO survey has found that access to HIV medicines has been severely impacted by COVID-19. 73 countries have warned that they are at risk of stock-outs of antiretroviral (ARV) medicines as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the survey conducted ahead of the International AIDS Society's biannual conference.

- In today's [7 Jul 2020] 'subject in focus' below we present an update from the WHO Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) who have been holding a conference on exploring new interventions to tackle the infodemic.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update (please note that there has been consistent weekend reporting artifact since the presentation of these data began):
-----------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 54.9% of the global newly reported cases and 50.1% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period. The USA reported 46.1% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, and Brazil reported 27.5%, Mexico 4.9%, Colombia 3.9%, Peru 3.8%, Chile 3.2%, and Argentina 2.6%. Basically the same countries in the same order. While Brazil had been reporting 30 000+ cases a day, the number of daily new cases is starting to decrease over the past week,

The European region reported 10.8% of the global newly reported cases and 12.1% of the newly confirmed deaths in the region. Russia reported 34.1% of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by Sweden 8.8%, Spain 6.7%, Kazakhstan 5.9%, Turkey 5.8%, France 4.5%, Israel 4.4%, Ukraine 3.0%, Azerbaijan 2.7%, and Kyrgyzstan 2.4%. These countries all merit keeping an eye on their case counts as the numbers of reported cases is increasing.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 9.8% of the global newly reported cases and 15.7% of global newly reported fatalities. Saudi Arabia reported 24.9% of the regional newly reported cases followed Pakistan by 15.9%, Iran 15.5%, Iraq 10.6%, Oman 9.2%, Egypt 5.7%, Kuwait 4.2%, Qatar 3.2%, and UAE 3.1%. Multiple countries are very active in the region -- same countries with some changes in the order since yesterday (6 Jul 2020).

The African region reported 7.3% of the global newly reported cases and 4.8% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 71.0% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Cote d'Ivoire 5.7%, Nigeria 4.6%, Cameroon 3.9%, Algeria 3.7%, Madagascar 2.4%, and Ethiopia 2.2%. South Africa remains number 1 and other countries are varied. It appears as though Nigeria is slowing down in transmission. Of note is that South Africa reported almost 9000 cases today (7 Jul 2020).

The Western Pacific region reported 1.6% of the global newly reported cases and 0.29% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 76.8% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 7.6%, Singapore 6.8%, Australia 5.1%, South Korea 1.6%, and China 0.92%. The Philippines is consistently reporting the highest number of cases with Japan at number 2.

The South East Asia region reported 15.6% of the global newly reported cases and 17.1% of global deaths. India reported 82.8% of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 11.9%, Indonesia 4.5%, and Nepal 0.67%. Same countries, same order as in previous days, with India continuing to be the driving force in the regional growth in cases.

Impression (unchanged): The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis, followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean alternating on a daily basis of their order, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific representing the lowest daily caseload of all of the regions. The Africa region is slowing increasing their representation in terms of increased case reporting.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 7 Jul 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent visual representation of the epidemic as described in the above text. The Americas region continues to increase, as does South-East Asia, in terms of daily newly confirmed cases; the African region is noticeably increasing as well. The Americas region continues to greatly outnumber all other regions for daily reporting.- Mod.MPP]

[*On 2 Jul 2020, the Worldometer (and the Johns Hopkins CSSE data) showed a decrease in 29 726 cases for the UK. From https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/about: "Pillar 2 data for England has had duplicate tests for the same person removed by PHE from 2 Jul 2020. This means that the cumulative total number of UK lab-confirmed cases is now around 30 000 lower than reported on 1 Jul 2020." - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ
**On 2 Jun 2020, France completed a review of all positive lab tests reported and removed all duplicate tests on individuals who were counted more than once. This led to a decrease in cumulative case counts.
In the table above, NA is "not applicable"; those countries whose 1st case was reported after 1 Mar 2020 did not have cases on 1 Mar 2020. - Mod.MPP]

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 11 949 280, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. Given the level of daily newly confirmed cases, tomorrow (8 Jul 2020) the global total of cases will cross the 12 million mark, having crossed the 11 million mark on 3 Jul 2020. The global case count rose by 1.8% in the past 24 hours. The USA, with more than 3.09 million confirmed cases, now represents 25.9% of the global cases of COVID-19, and Brazil with more than 1.67 million cases represents 14.0% of the global cases of COVID-19. Other countries such as India, Mexico, Chile, Peru, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan are reporting increased numbers of new and cumulative cases as well. If one tallies the total cumulative case counts for the top 5 countries (USA, Brazil, India, Russia, and Peru), they represent over half of the total cases reported globally (54.6%). A global total of 546 601 deaths have been reported, an increase of 5941 deaths in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by Brazil, India, South Africa, Russia, Mexico, Colombia Peru, Saudi Arabia, and Bangladesh. All countries that are currently experiencing major community-based transmission and considered global hot spots. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases went from 3027 to 56 251.

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts. - Mod.MPP]
