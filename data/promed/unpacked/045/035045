Following reports of a good number of buffaloes dying in a recent outbreak of suspected haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS), a team from the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services (AH&VS) department visited the affected areas under Medziphema on 12 Apr 2019. Haemorrhagic septicaemia is a contagious bacterial disease that affects cattle and water buffalo with a high mortality rate in infected animals.

AH&VS, deputy director and principal investigator, AICRP-ADMAS, Dr S. Amenla Walling, in a press release reported that the team consisted of the department's director, Dr Temsumeren, along with additional director, Dr. Budhi Lama, and other officials from the department.

The press release added that the area is prone to such kind of disease outbreaks, and the department officials reminded villagers to cooperate with the department and vaccinate their animals against such outbreaks.

The team told the villagers that even an outbreak can be contained more effectively if villagers report the matter on time to the nearest veterinary health centre.

Meanwhile, when contacted, Dr S. Amenla Walling told Nagaland Post that it is difficult to say if the disease has been fully contained since it's free grazing season for the animals, but the department is doing its best under the circumstances.

Hemorrhagic septicemia (HS), an OIE-listed disease, is a highly fatal bacterial disease seen mainly in cattle and water buffalo. HS results from infection by _Pasteurella multocida_ subsp. _multocida_; only 2 serotypes of this organism classically cause HS. In susceptible animals, the clinical signs often progress rapidly from dullness and fever to death within hours. Because the disease develops so quickly, few animals can be treated in time, and recovery is rare. Subclinical carriers can introduce hemorrhagic septicemia into a herd. Young animals are mainly affected in endemic regions, and outbreaks are particularly common during rainy weather, when the organism can spread readily. In areas where cattle have no immunity, severe disease is expected to occur in all ages.

This disease can be eradicated with quarantines, movement controls, tracing of contacts, euthanasia of infected and exposed animals, and cleaning and disinfection of the premises. In endemic areas, HS is mainly prevented by vaccination. The 2 HS serotypes of _Pasteurella_ do not infect humans.
