Measles outbreak in Andalusia, Spain, January to August 2011 (By: Mayoral Cortes JM, Perez Morilla E, Gallardo Garcia V, Navarro Mari JM, Perez Ruiz M, Hermosilla R, Diaz-Borrego J, Rodriguez Romero E, Ruiz Fernandez J., in Euro Surveill. 2012;17(42))

Summary:
-------------
On 7 Jan 2011, a 6-year-old child living in a Roma community near Seville, southern Spain was hospitalised with measles. Contact tracing identified a probable index case with onset of symptoms on 20 Dec 2011 and several unreported cases among children under the age of 15 years in the same town. The outbreak initially spread in districts in the city of Seville with a high proportion of Roma residents, and later to other cities and towns in Andalusia. While some towns experienced wide spread of the disease with significant clusters of cases, most of the affected locations saw non-clustered cases or very few secondary cases. The outbreak resulted in 1759 confirmed or probable cases of which 393 (19 percent) required hospitalisation.

Measles virus of genotype D4 was diagnosed in more than half of the cases. Significant differences (p under 0.0001) by age group were found between clustered and non-clustered cases. The highest proportion of clustered cases occurred in the age group of 5-14 year olds, while the highest proportion of non-clustered cases was seen in those older than 29 years. The last confirmed case related to this outbreak was reported on 20 Aug 2011.

Discussion:
--------------
The measles outbreak began among a Roma population with low vaccine coverage and spread rapidly due to the high number of susceptible individuals and the high mobility of this population, which generated a high number of contacts. This facilitated the spread to surrounding communities with pockets of unvaccinated susceptible children in many municipalities in Andalusia. These areas with low vaccination coverage saw an accumulation of clustered case among unvaccinated children, while in the rest of the population, the outbreak spread more slowly, leading to significant geographical differences in the spread of the outbreak. Other municipalities only saw non-clustered cases or small numbers of cases, with a higher proportion of young adults who became ill.

This outbreak occurred in a context of a recent re-emergence of measles in Europe since 2008, with some outbreaks affecting Roma populations. Also in other parts of Spain, measles outbreaks have been reported, with the same genotype as the one in Andalusia, in Madrid in 2010 and a different genotype B3 in Granada in October 2010.

Among the causes that may in recent years have contributed to the formation of pockets of susceptible children were the limited use of preventive services in certain population groups and the paradox that followed the success of childhood immunisation programmes. The high vaccination coverage made the disease disappear during the past decade and led to a low perception of risk regarding the severity of measles or its health and social costs. This situation may also have contributed to a further relaxation of health services in developing risk management strategies for vaccination of vulnerable populations. We understand that cultural or religious beliefs questioning vaccination or vaccine safety had no relevance for the origin and development of the outbreak described here.

In recent outbreaks reported in Europe, the largest proportion of cases occurred in children aged between 5 and 14 years. In successive epidemic waves in Switzerland and France, this has also been the most affected age group, and vaccination coverage for one dose of MMR vaccine was below 90 percent.

In our outbreak, the largest proportion of cases were adults aged 15 to 39 years. Although the vaccination coverage in Andalusia in general is appropriate to interrupt transmission of the disease in the population (over 95 percent during the last 12 years), a seroprevalence study conducted in 1996 in the population between 2 and 40 years of age showed that more than 5 percent of individuals in the cohort born between 1977 and 1986 (currently between 25 and 34 years-old) were susceptible. Updating the vaccination of these age groups has so far not been considered feasible, so more cases may occur in this age group in the future.

In addition, we saw a high incidence rate and a considerable number of hospital admissions among children younger than 15 months, who were not vaccinated because of their age. In particular, the proportion of cases among children 12 to 15 months of age (5.3 percent of total) indicates a need to lower the age for the 1st dose of MMR in our childhood vaccination schedule.

The most frequent complications in hospitalised patients were pneumonia, digestive disorders, respiratory insufficiency and dyspnoea, which is in line with the complications described in scientific literature. We would like to point out that liver disorder was detected in 12 cases, involving aminotransferase elevation (9 cases), hepatomegaly (2 cases) and cholestasis (one case). Half of these cases were male; the age ranged from 24 to 39 years, and none of them had any underlying disease. Although this complication is infrequent, it has also been described in literature.

It is important to emphasise the importance of preventing measles transmission in healthcare staff. The risk of disease in non-immune healthcare workers is much higher than in the general population, and vaccination in this group must be strengthened. About 20 percent of the cases in this outbreak were hospitalised, figures lower than reported in France and higher than in Switzerland (15 percent). To prevent transmission in waiting rooms of health centres, emergency rooms and hospital wards, training sessions were organised for staff of health services in the outbreak area, and a written waiver was requested from staff declining the offered vaccine. However, 41 healthcare workers became ill, which constitutes a high risk of nosocomial transmission to non-immune or immunocompromised patients, as the essential respiratory isolation measures are not sufficient to prevent nosocomial transmission.

In our view, interventions to control the outbreak, particularly through early notification of cases to facilitate early post-exposure immunisation, vaccination in schools and preschools, and lowering the age for vaccination in affected education institutions have probably reduced the intensity and duration of the outbreak, especially in children.

Anti-vaccination movements, with arguments not sustained by the evidence, produce serious harm to society. Often, they are responsible, in part, for the decline in vaccination rates that trigger outbreaks of easily preventable diseases.

In recent years, we are witnessing the resurgence of measles, accompanied by its complications, not only in Spain but in the surrounding countries. In 2011, there were more than 30 000 cases of measles in Europe, with 9 deaths in young children, which could have been avoided if the number of people vaccinated had not fallen.

Probably one of the reasons why these beliefs persist is the ignorance that exists in relation to the long process of development of vaccines, which sometimes take many years of development and safety testing before release for general administration, a process that requires greater stringency than in the case of most of the other drugs that many of us take on a regular basis.

According to the Angop news agency, 5 children died of measles this month [October 2012] in Chibia municipality, southern Huila province as a result of 35 cases recorded in the region. A local health source said that despite the deaths, the outbreak is under control as a vaccination campaign has been in progress since September 2012.

The campaign is taking place in the localities of Jau, Capunda, Cavilongo, Quihita and at the municipal headquarters. The local health authorities are calling on parents to rush to a health centre if they suspect their child has measles.

[Five deaths of children among 35 cases is an extraordinarily high case/fatality ratio. It suggests deficiencies in surveillance.

A Xi'an Evening News reporter learned from a sub-provincial city immunization planning meeting held recently in Xi'an that the measles epidemic for the year up to September 2012 fell to a record low. The monitoring data showed that the total incidence as of 1 Sep 2012 was down to single digits.

Measles is an acute respiratory infection caused by measles virus. After onset of fever, cough, runny nose, conjunctival hyperemia, and body rash, the disease is often complicated by pneumonia, and may endanger the lives of infants and young children. It is spread by respiratory droplets. In recent years, the incidence of measles in Xi'an reached a peak in spring and summer. More than 80 percent of the cases are observed in children up to 14 years of age.

CDC staff are asking parents to ensure that school-age children are fully immunized. The 1st inoculation should be at 2 months followed by a 2nd inoculation at 18-24 months.

At the same time, student dormitories and other public and communal living spaces should be regularly ventilated; clothing and bedding should be aired, and hand-washing and personal hygiene strictly observed.

The city has completed nearly 200 new vaccination clinics located in urban community health service centers and township hospitals capable of vaccinating 2000 to 4000 children, the aim being to achieve a vaccination rate of greater than 95 percent and complete eradication of the disease among the non-migrant population.

[The city of Xi'an seems well on the way to achieving eradication of measles virus infection among the non-migrant population at least.

Xi'an is the capital of Shaanxi province and a sub-provincial city in the People's Republic of China. It is one of the oldest cities in China, with more than 3000 years of history. The city was known as Chang'an before the Ming Dynasty. Xi'an is one of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China, having held the position under several of the most important dynasties in Chinese history.

Vaccination coverage among children in kindergarten--United States, 2011-12 school year
-----------------------------------
Abstract: In 2011, CDC reported 17 outbreaks of measles and 222 measles cases, most of which were imported cases in unvaccinated persons. This was the highest number of measles cases in any year in the United States since 1996 and highlights the importance of monitoring measles vaccination coverage at the local level. To identify areas of under-vaccination for measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases, state and local health departments monitor compliance with school immunization requirements using annual school vaccination assessment reports, supported as a CDC immunization funding objective for the 64 grantees, including the 50 states, the District of Columbia (DC), 5 cities, and 8 other reporting areas. CDC also monitors progress toward meeting Healthy People 2020 objectives for the vaccination of children entering kindergarten.

This report summarizes vaccination coverage, exemption rates, and reporting methods from the 2011-12 school year kindergarten vaccination assessments submitted by 56 grantees, including 49 states, DC, one city, and 5 other reporting areas. Median coverage with 2 doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine was 94.8 percent among 47 reporting states and DC. Total exemption rates, including medical, religious, and philosophic exemptions, among 49 reporting states and DC, ranged from under 0.1 percent to 7.0 percent (median: 1.5 percent).

Although statewide levels of vaccination coverage are at or very near target levels, locally low vaccination coverage for extremely transmissible diseases such as measles remains a threat to health. Monitoring MMR vaccination coverage at the local and state level will continue to be critical as long as the risk for measles importation and outbreaks exist.
