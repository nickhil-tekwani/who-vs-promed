U.S. experts have confirmed that [it was the Hendra-like virus that
infected workers at a pig abattoir in Singapore recently, the Singapore
government said Tuesday. The virus is similar to the one detected in the
current pig viral outbreak [? in Malaysia, which has already killed 63
people and had earlier been blamed on Japanese encephalitis virus.
One worker at an abattoir here, [who slaughtered pigs imported from
Malaysia, died earlier this month from meningoencephalitis. Seven other
workers from the same abattoir were hospitalized with the same condition.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta,
Georgia, found the virus [? in blood samples from all these workers. It
also detected the virus [? in the blood of three other abattoir workers who
[had compatible signs and symptoms, such as fever.
Jimmy Sng, a doctor in the Pathology Department at Singapore General
Hospital, said the new virus is about 20% different [genetically from the
Hendra virus discovered in the Australian outbreak in 1994.
Unlike Japanese encephalitis [virus, which is spread by _Culex_
mosquitoes and is quite common in pig farms in Asia, the Hendra-like virus,
[not known to occur in pigs previous to this experience is transmitted by
close contact with the blood, tissue or urine of infected animals.
Doctors at the press conference said they are treating patients who have
the Hendra[-like virus with medication normally used to treat patients with
herpes viruses, such as those suffering from chickenpox.
Ngiam said Singapore has contained the disease by imposing a total ban on
the import of pigs and closing down two abattoirs for thorough disinfection
[on March 19. Imports of other animals from Malaysia, including horses
and even dogs and cats, have also been banned. Only poultry is now allowed
to be imported from Malaysia.

[I understand that CDC Atlanta found 11 of 15 blood specimens sent to
them contained IgM antibodies to the Hendra-like virus. It seems clear that
the source of the Singapore outbreak was infected pigs imported from
Malaysia. The origin of the Malaysian Hendra-like virus, however, has yet
to be determined. There is also no reliable documentation of the clinical
disease (and deaths) caused by this virus in horses and pigs in Malaysia.
