California: Sentinel Chickens Detect St. Louis Encephalitis Virus
--------------------------------------------------
The virus that causes St. Louis encephalitis [SLE] has turned up in sentinel
chickens in Blythe, prompting Riverside County health officials to advise
the public to take precautions. Mosquitoes spread the virus from infected
birds. SLE virus can cause fatal brain swelling in humans, although most
people experience only mild symptoms, such as fever, headache, fatigue, and
muscle aches.
The disease is considered rare: From 1964 to 1998, 122 cases were confirmed
in California [averaging less than 4 cases per year], according to the
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]. Steve Van Stockum,
Riverside County's deputy environmental health director, said he could not
recall a human case in the county. The last [SLE] human case in California
occurred in 1997.
Riverside County vector control workers found the virus in blood drawn from
sentinel chickens used to monitor mosquito-borne diseases, such as those
caused by St. Louis encephalitis virus and West Nile virus. The results
were confirmed on Wed 1 Oct 2003.
Health officials advise the public to avoid areas with lots of mosquitoes,
wear long-sleeve shirts and long pants, and use repellents with DEET.

[St. Louis encephalitis is one of the most important mosquito-borne diseases
in North America. The virus is maintained in a mosquito-bird-mosquito cycle,
with periodic amplification in peridomestic birds and culicine mosquitoes.
The principal vector in the south-east is _Culex nigripalpus_, in the midwest
_Cx. pipiens pipiens_, and in the west _Cx. tarsalis_. Although SLE virus (a
flavivirus antigenically related to Japanese encephalitis virus) is prevalent
throughout the Western Hemisphere from Canada to Argentina, outbreaks of
disease have not been reported in Central and South America.
SLE epidemics, on the other hand, have occurred throughout the United States,
especially in midwestern and southeastern states. The last major outbreak
occurred in the Midwest from 1974 to 1977, when more than 2500 cases were
reported from 35 states. More recently, according to CDC data, outbreaks of
SLE have been limited in size (usually less than 30 cases). During the period
1964-1998 [35 years] a total of 4478 confirmed cases of SLE were recorded in
the United States, [only] 122 of which occurred in the state of California,
as mentioned in the report. Further information and a detailed map indicting
the numbers and locations of confirmed cases can be viewed at the CDC website
