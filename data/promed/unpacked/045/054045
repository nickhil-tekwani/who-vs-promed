Local health officials are encouraging people to avoid exposure to
mosquitoes; there are reports that 2 men in Kalamazoo County and 1 woman in
Barry County have tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis [EEE].
The mosquitoborne virus has killed 1 horse in Allegan County and 18 horses
in Barry, Calhoun, Cass, and Kalamazoo counties as of 23 Aug 2010,
according to the Michigan departments of Community Health and Agriculture.

Allegan County Health Department director of environmental health, Bill
Hinz, said that 4 other horses have died under suspicion of the disease.
Tests are pending on 2 of them, and the other 2 tested negative. "There
have been no reports for humans (in Allegan County) getting the virus,"
Hinz said.

The disease is spread by viruses found in wild birds. Mosquitoes that feed
on infected birds can transmit the disease to humans, horses, and other
birds. Some birds are able to harbor the disease without becoming acutely
ill, serving as reservoirs for the disease.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, most
people infected with the virus have no apparent illness. Severe cases begin
with the sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills, and vomiting. The
illness may then progress into disorientation, seizures, or coma. "There is
no specific treatment for (eastern equine encephalitis); care is based on
symptoms," states the website. "You can reduce your risk of being infected
with EEEV by using insect repellent, wearing protective clothing, and
staying indoors while mosquitoes are most active." Hinz said that time is
dusk and dawn. "The best thing for people -- even though it's hard this
time of year with a hot, wet summer -- is to wear long sleeves and pants
and use mosquito repellent with DEET," he said. Other good repellents
contain picaridin, IR3535, or oil of lemon or eucalyptus.

Hinz said people should also eliminate mosquito breeding sites by emptying
standing water and changing water in bird baths and pet dishes weekly. The
risk of infection will continue until late fall when nighttime temperatures
fall below freezing. Hinz said the health department was in contact with
veterinarians and local health providers.

"The vets are contacting their clients for immunizations and handing out
information about EEE, how to control mosquitoes," Hinz said. "We've told
local doctors to be on the lookout for the disease, as well."

These are the 1st human cases reported in Michigan since 2002. More than 50
additional cases in horses have been reported. The southwestern region of
the state previously experienced an outbreak of the disease in the early
1980s and the mid-1990s.

Walton County health officials are reporting a horse testing positive for
eastern equine encephalitis [EEE]. EEE is a mosquitoborne disease that
infects a wide variety of animals and people. There is no cure.

For affected horses, 70-90 per cent of the horses that contract the disease
die within 2-4-days after the signs appear.

The symptoms in humans include high fever, muscle pain, altered mental
status, headache, meningeal irritation, photophobia, and seizures.

The best way to prevent EEE is to avoid mosquitoes and practise the 5 "Ds":
- avoid being outdoors at Dusk and Dawn when mosquitoes are seeking blood;
- Dress in clothing that covers most of your skin;
- use mosquito repellents that contain at least 30 per cent of the active
ingredient DEET; and
- Drain standing water from areas around your house that could become
breeding grounds for mosquitoes.

The 1st article details many equine deaths, preventable by vaccination.
Using mosquito repellant made for horses on the horse is also helpful.

Elimination of the mosquito breeding areas is also important for reducing
your risk as well as the risk of your animals. - Mod.TG]
