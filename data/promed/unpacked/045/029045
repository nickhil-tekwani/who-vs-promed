Mystery illness sparks fears for French horses
-------------------------------------------------
French horses from an equestrian opera troupe are to be placed in a
quarantine stable to avoid contracting an unknown illness that has affected
more than 110 local racehorses.
The Hong Kong Jockey Club said 27 horses flying in from France for the
French Equestrian Opera, Le Cadre Noir de Saumur, would be housed at a
quarantine stable at Sha Tin race course with specially trained grooms.
Fifty-five crew members from the French riding school will be accompanied
by 5 grooms and a veterinarian to take care of the horses, which arrive on
Wednesday (3 May 2000).
About 111 local horses have been suffering from loss of appetite and
several have had fever but the illness has not been identified. Blood tests
were carried out over the weekend.
A Jockey Club spokesman said the French horses would be housed one
kilometer away from local racehorses in the quarantine stable at the other
end of the race course. The visiting horses would be in quarantine for the
duration of their stay.
"It is not known why the horses have no appetite. We expect them to be fine
in 1 or 2 days," the spokesman said. He said horses from overseas were
usually placed in quarantine.
The equestrian opera, to be held from 12-14 May 2000, is a French May
festival event and features international diva Lucille Vignon.
Air France, which is sponsoring the air transport, will also ship half of
the 40 tons of sand needed for the event directly from France. An airline
spokesman said 9 special loading units would be used to carry the horses on
board a 747-200 cargo flight.

[There are some conflicting reports of what is happening in Hong Kong. I
have seen reports of a mysterious virus, or piroplasmosis, of a diagnosed
virus, and of a bacterial disease. Perhaps "mysterious illness" is the best
as this illness does not seem well defined at the moment. Although the
piroplasmosis was well defined, these others have been confused with it. We
would appreciate an authoritative report. - Mod. TG]
