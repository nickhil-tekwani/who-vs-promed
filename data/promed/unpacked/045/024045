We report the detection and confirmation of EV68 [now designated enterovirus D68] in recent hospitalized pediatric cases at a major pediatric tertiary centre in Calgary. Our findings complement earlier reports of EV68 respiratory infections reported from the Midwest USA states (see ProMED posts 20140908.2757391 and 20140908.2758285). Taken together, this information supports a more widespread geographical distribution of this respiratory agent, now both in the USA and Canada, coincident with an increase in visits to emergency departments, some of which may be related to exacerbations of respiratory conditions.

From 1-11 Sep 2014, the Alberta Childrens Hospital (ACH), Calgary, one of the 2 major pediatric centres in Alberta, noted a significant increase in the number of patients admitted compared with the same period last year [2013]. We identified 9 cases of EV68 among children hospitalized at the ACH with an admitting diagnosis of asthma or bronchiolitis during this period. Two were transferred to the pediatric ICU, of whom one required continuous positive air pressure (CPAP), and 4 needed supplemental oxygen. Three cases had a prior history of asthma, and a 4th had a prior admission for an RSV [respiratory syncytial virus] infection; none of the other 5 children had a prior hospital admission for a respiratory complication. The ages of the patients ranged from 22 months to 12 years, 4 of whom were female.

In a 2 step algorithm at the Provincial Laboratory, these samples 1st tested negative for influenza A and B viruses, hence they were then tested in the XTAG Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP, Luminex, Austin, TX, USA), which also includes the entero/rhinoviruses group; previously, we found this assay able to detect EV68 strains. Although the RVP assay detects both rhinoviruses and enteroviruses, it does not distinguish between them; therefore, samples positive for entero/rhinovirus were selected for further testing. Enteroviruses were distinguished from rhinoviruses through an in-house RT-PCR assay specifically targeting the 5 NCR of enteroviruses, which were then typed by sequencing. Portions of the following genes namely, 5 non-coding region (293 bp), VP4 (207 bp) and VP2 (250 bp), were amplified and sequenced using the primers and methodology of Coiras et al, 2004. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic comparisons of the VP2 region were performed against representative sequences in GenBank.

Phylogenetic comparisons of the 9 strains show they are closely similar but significantly divergent from the prototype Fermon strain isolated 1962 (Schieble et al., 1967) and from relatively recent USA strains deposited in 2009. The closest match was to GenBank number KM361524. As there are no sequences deposited in a publicly accessible database of the recent Midwest cases, we cannot determine the similarity between our strains and theirs.

In summary, we have found EV68 to be circulating in Alberta; further studies are on-going to determine when this agent 1st appeared, the diversity of circulating strains, and the clinical presentation associated with this emerging virus.

[ProMED-mail thanks Kevin Fonseca for provision of this detailed account of the identification of enterovirus D68 in Albertan patients suffering severe respiratory infections. It is likely that enterovirus D68 virus is causing outbreaks of severe respiratory infection throughout North America. - Mod.CP
