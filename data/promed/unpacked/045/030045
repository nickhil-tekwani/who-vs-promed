DOH declares measles outbreak in M Padilla controlled
-----------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health (DOH) Western Visayas declared that the measles
outbreak in Moises Padilla, Negros Occidental has been controlled. In a
press statement DOH said that last October 2008, laboratory results from
Research Institute of Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Manila confirmed 3
measles cases in Moises Padilla among children aged 16 years, 9 years, and
18 months. These cases occurred in barangays Guinpana-an, Montilla, and Odiong.

Aside from the 3 confirmed cases, 70 cases manifested the same symptoms as
those of the confirmed cases like fever, non-vesicular rashes, runny nose,
and cough. DOH noted that those affected were not immunized against
measles. DOH reported that logistic support like vaccine, syringes,
advisory notices, and other medicines were immediately provided to Moises
Padilla town. A thorough "mopping up" operation to look for unimmunized
children was done and vaccination was conducted by the Rural Health Unit
personnel to all unimmunized children aged between 9 months and 15 years.
Vitamin A capsule was also given to all children aged 6 months to 71 months.

DOH said, however, that although the outbreak was controlled, measles virus
is still circulating in the area and the possibility of an outbreak may
occur if targeted children are not immunized. With this, DOH strongly
recommended the different local governments to strengthen routine
immunization in hard to reach areas and to intensify their information
dissemination regarding the importance of immunization.

Measles is a highly infectious disease caused by a virus, which may cause
death especially among malnourished children. It is spread through contact
with nose and throat secretions and in airborne droplets when an infected
person coughs or sneezes. The signs and symptoms are high grade fever,
cough, and rashes that appear on the forehead, behind the ears, and
sometimes all over the body.

DOH also strongly advised parents to bring their children below one year
old to the nearest health center or hospital in their area to avail of free
immunization against TB, measles, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis
B, and poliomyelitis.
