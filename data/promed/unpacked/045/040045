Moderna today [22 Jun 2022] reported that the bivalent (2-strain) mRNA vaccine it developed against omicron showed a strong neutralizing antibody response against the omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants and that it will seek regulatory approval in the coming weeks. Moderna's bivalent vaccine contains its original vaccine plus a strain that targets omicron and its subvariants.

The announcement comes amid rising BA.4 and BA.5 levels worldwide, which are fueling new spikes in cases, the World Health Organization (WHO) said today [22 Jun 2022] in its latest update.

In today's announcement [22 Jun 2022], Moderna said the bivalent booster upped neutralizing antibodies 5.4-fold against BA.4 and BA.5 above baseline in all participants, regardless of prior infections, with a 6.3-fold increase in a group of seronegative participants -- those showing evidence of past infection. One month after receiving the bivalent booster, neutralizing geometric mean titers (GMTs) were against BA.4 and BA.5 were 941 in all participants and 727 in the seronegative group. For comparison, earlier studies of the booster induced a neutralizing GMT of 629 against BA.1 and 828 against the delta variant. A higher GMT indicates a more robust immune response.

In the United States, overall COVID-19 activity shows signs of a slow rise, though it's difficult to precisely gauge, due to decreased testing and the growing use of at-home tests. Activity levels are brisk, especially in areas where BA.4 and BA.5 are most prevalent, especially the south central states. The Texas Department of State Health Services said today [22 Jun 2022] that the positivity rate is over 23% in that state, and cases, hospitalizations, and deaths continue to rise.

In its latest weekly update today [22 Jun 2022], WHO said BA.5 and BA.4, which share a mutation associated with higher transmissibility, are, when taken together, increasing in prevalence -- from 32% the previous week to 34% for the most recent week. BA.5 accounts for 25% of sequenced samples, up from 16% the week before, and BA.4 is at 9%, down from 16% the previous week. So far, the 2 subvariants have been detected in 62 and 58 countries, respectively. Levels of BA.2.12.1, another omicron variant, which was first identified in New York, are declining.

"The rise in prevalence of BA.4 and BA.5 has coincided with a rise in cases in several WHO regions. In some countries, the rise in cases has also led to a surge in hospitalizations and [intensive care unit] admissions," WHO said. It added, however, that the current evidence doesn't show changes in severity.

[It is difficult to draw significant conclusions from reported case counts over time because of decreased testing and prevalence of use of in home tests, which go unreported. Hospitalizations can more accurately be compared, and in some WHO regions, these numbers have been increasing with circulation of omicron variants. - Mod.LK]

[B] Subvariants escape antibodies
Date: Wed 22 Jun 2022

Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 appear to escape antibody responses among both people who had previous COVID-19 infection, and those who have been fully vaccinated and boosted, according to new data from researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, of Harvard Medical School. However, COVID-19 vaccination is still expected to provide substantial protection against severe disease, and vaccine makers are working on updated shots that might elicit a stronger immune response against the variants.

The levels of neutralizing antibodies that a previous infection or vaccinations elicit are several times lower against the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants compared with the original coronavirus, according to the new research published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday [22 Jun 2022]. [Hachmann NP, Miller J, Collier AY, et al. Neutralization escape by SARS-CoV-2 omicron subvariants BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5. NEJM. 22 Jun 2022. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMc2206576.]

"We observed 3-fold reductions of neutralizing antibody titers induced by vaccination and infection against BA4 and BA5 compared with BA1 and BA2, which are already substantially lower than the original COVID-19 variants," Dr. Dan Barouch, an author of the paper and director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, wrote in an email to CNN. "Our data suggest that these new omicron subvariants will likely be able to lead to surges of infections in populations with high levels of vaccine immunity as well as natural BA1 and BA2 immunity," Barouch wrote. "However, it is likely that vaccine immunity will still provide substantial protection against severe disease with BA4 and BA5."

The newly published findings echo separate research by scientists at Columbia University. They recently found that the BA.4 and BA.5 viruses were more likely to escape antibodies from the blood of fully vaccinated and boosted adults compared with other omicron subvariants, raising the risk of vaccine-breakthrough COVID-19 infections. The authors of that separate study say their results point to a higher risk for reinfection, even in people who have some prior immunity against the virus. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates 94.7% of the US population ages 16 and older have antibodies against the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 through vaccination, infection, or both.

BA.4 and BA.5 caused an estimated 35% of new COVID-19 infections in the United States last week, up from 29% the week before, according to data shared by CDC on Tuesday [21 Jun 2022]. BA.4 and BA.5 are the fastest spreading variants reported to date, and they are expected to dominate COVID-19 transmission in the United States, United Kingdom and the rest of Europe within the next few weeks, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

In the New England Journal of Medicine paper, among 27 research participants who had been vaccinated and boosted with the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, the researchers found that 2 weeks after the booster dose, levels of neutralizing antibodies against omicron subvariants were much lower than the response against the original coronavirus. The neutralizing antibody levels were lower by a factor of 6.4 against BA.1; by a factor of 7 against BA.2; by a factor of 14.1 against BA.2.12.1 and by a factor of 21 against BA.4 or BA.5, the researchers described. Among 27 participants who had previously been infected with the BA.1 or BA.2 subvariants a median of 29 days earlier, the researchers found similar results.

In those with previous infection -- most of whom also had been vaccinated -- the researchers described neutralizing antibody levels that were lower by a factor of 6.4 against BA.1; by a factor of 5.8 against BA.2; by a factor of 9.6 against BA.2.12.1 and by a factor of 18.7 against BA.4 or BA.5.

More research is needed to determine what exactly the neutralizing antibody levels mean for vaccine effectiveness and whether similar findings would emerge among a larger group of participants. "Our data suggest that COVID-19 still has the capacity to mutate further, resulting in increased transmissibility and increased antibody escape," Barouch wrote in the email. "As pandemic restrictions are lifted, it is important that we remain vigilant and keep studying new variants and subvariants as they emerge."

A separate study, published in the journal Nature last week, found that omicron may evolve mutations to evade the immunity elicited by having a previous BA.1 infection, which suggests that vaccine boosters based on BA.1 may not achieve broad-spectrum protection against new omicron subvariants like BA.4 and BA.5. [Cao Y, Yisimayi A, Jian F, et al. BA.2.12.1, BA.4 and BA.5 escape antibodies elicited by omicron infection. Nature (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-04980-y]

As for what all this means in the real world, Dr Wesley Long, an experimental pathologist at Houston Methodist Hospital, told CNN that people should be aware that they could get sick again, even if they've had COVID-19 before.

[2] Paxlovid
Date: Wed 22 Jun 2022
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/06/paxlovid-shown-effective-against-visits-severe-covid-19


Pfizer's antiviral drug Paxlovid was tied to very few COVID-related visits to the emergency department (ED) or hospital, but people in socially vulnerable US regions are less likely to receive it or a similar COVID-19 drug, according to 2 studies published yesterday [21 Jun 2022] in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR).

The first study showed that less than 1% of people taking Paxlovid reported to an ED or hospital for COVID-19 within 5-15 days. [Malden DE, Hong V, Lewin BJ, et al. Hospitalization and emergency department encounters for COVID-19 after Paxlovid treatment -- California, December 2021-May 2022. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. ePub: 21 June 2022. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7125e2]

The drug is a combination of 2 antiviral medications -- nirmatrelvir and ritonavir -- and was approved for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2021 for people with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are at risk for progression to severe disease.

For the study, researchers with Kaiser Permanente, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Harvard University, and the University of California, Berkeley, analyzed electronic health record data from Kaiser Permanente Southern California on 5287 patients 12 years old and older who received Paxlovid from 31 Dec 2021, through 26 May 2022. Among the group, 72.5% had received 3 or more COVID vaccine doses, and 7.8% were unvaccinated.

The authors said that only 39 of the patients visited the ED (0.74%) and only 6 were hospitalized (0.11%) for symptoms related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among these 45 patients, 21 (47%) were aged 65 years or older, and 35 (78%) had at least one underlying medical condition. All hospitalized patients were either elderly or had an underlying condition or both. Two of them died, but none died in the ED group.

Among the 5287 patients, 57.2% were female, 42.5% were White, and 30.3% were Hispanic. Median age was 61 years, and 56.7% had one or more underlying medical conditions.

The authors conclude, "When administered as an early-stage treatment, Paxlovid might prevent COVID-19-related hospitalization among persons with mild to moderate COVID-19 cases who are at risk for progression to severe disease. Additional research is warranted to provide further understanding of the apparent association between Paxlovid and reduced risk for severe COVID-19 illness, including studies with control groups and more precise indicators of COVID-19 illness severity."

Uptake about half in areas most socially vulnerable
---------------------------------------------------
In the 2nd MMWR study, CDC scientists reported that, while the most socially vulnerable ZIP codes have more locations to get COVID antiviral drugs, the people in those areas received the medications less often than those in less vulnerable neighborhoods. [Gold JA, Kelleher J, Magid J, et al. Dispensing of oral antiviral drugs for treatment of COVID-19 by zip code-level social vulnerability -- United States, 23 Dec 2021-21 May 2022. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. ePub: 21 June 2022. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7125e1]

The researchers analyzed data on 1 076 762 prescriptions for Paxlovid or molnupiravir (Lagevrio), another oral COVID-19 antiviral approved by the FDA for emergency use in December 2021. The latter drug is approved for adults only. They assessed uptake of the drugs by ZIP code areas classified as having low, medium, or high social vulnerability. They note that roughly 20% of US residents live in low-, 31% in medium-, and 49% in high-social vulnerability ZIP codes.

The study period spanned a similar period as the 1st study: 23 Dec 2021, through 21 May 2022. About 70% of the oral antivirals were dispensed from 7 Mar-21 May 2022. From 6 Mar 2022 through 21 May 2022, the number of antivirals dispensed per 100 000 population increased from 3.3 to 77.4 in low-, from 4.5 to 70.0 in medium-, and from 7.8 to 35.7 in high-vulnerability ZIP codes. The increase coincided with initiatives -- like Test to Treat -- to increase access to the drugs.

In spite of those efforts, by the end of the study period, dispensing rates in high-vulnerability ZIP codes were only about half the rates in medium- and low-vulnerability ZIP codes. And, as of 21 May 2022, 47.5% of dispensing sites were in high-vulnerability ZIP codes, 32.9% were in medium-vulnerability ZIP codes, and 19.6% were in low-vulnerability ZIP codes.

The authors conclude, "Oral antivirals can provide a critical intervention that can mitigate COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality. ... Additional public health, regulatory, and policy efforts might help to decrease barriers to oral antiviral access, particularly in communities with high social vulnerability."

[Malden and colleagues' study appears to have had no comparison group - that is, a group not given Paxlovid. What proportion of the population would have required an ED visit or hospital admission without the medication? The MMWR article cites Hammond and colleagues study from the New England Journal of Medicine, published in April 2022 https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2118542, saying "Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) ... has been shown to reduce the risk for hospitalization and death among patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 who are at risk for progression to severe disease". This is, of course, good news, and the relative risk reduction reported by Hammond and colleagues was substantial, but at this early stage in a drug's history further placebo controlled trials are needed. - Mod.SH]

[In the past 24 hours, 19 countries -- the USA (198 528), Germany (119 762), France (77 967), Brazil (70 285), Portugal (56 769), Italy (54 873), Taiwan (35 619), the UK (32 727), Argentina (28 039), Australia (17 589), Portugal (15 372), Mexico (15 364), North Korea (13 110), India (12 940), Columbia (13 810), Japan (17 160), Austria (10 898), Israel (10 747), and Greece (10 528) -- all reported over 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 1909 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 21 Jun 2022 to late 22 Jun 2022).

A total of 39 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 18 of the 39 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 4 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 4 are from the South East Asia region, and none from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 6.4%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 9.6%. Comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 2.9% decrease in daily reported cases and a 19.9% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 0.78 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 546.64 million cumulative reported cases and more than 6.34 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
