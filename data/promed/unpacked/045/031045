Cristin Muecke, the deputy chief medical officer of health, is urging anyone who develops pneumonia-like or respiratory symptoms to promptly seek medical care.

There is an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in the greater Moncton area, with 7 confirmed cases of the severe pneumonia in the past month, New Brunswick's deputy chief medical officer of health announced on Thursday [1 Aug 2019].

Public Health is working with "multiple partners" to investigate the source of the _Legionella_ bacteria, which can be found in both natural bodies of water and human-made water systems, such as large air-conditioning units, said Dr. Cristin Muecke.

[Moncton, with a population of 71 889 residents (2016), is the largest city in the Canadian province of New Brunswick and the inland center of the Maritime Provinces (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island); Greater Moncton, encompassing Moncton, and the towns of Riverview and Dieppe, has a population of 144 810 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moncton). A map showing the location of Moncton can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Moncton,+NB,+Canada.

Genotyping the clinical isolates of _Legionella_ from the 7 cases of Legionnaires' disease in the Greater Moncton area in the past month will help confirm whether this is a common source outbreak if the genotypes match. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. However, if the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping. - Mod.ML
