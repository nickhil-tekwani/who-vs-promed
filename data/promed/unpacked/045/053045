The city will not spray malathion to kill mosquitoes infected with the West
Nile virus until the Environmental Protection Agency completes its review
of the pesticide sometime late this summer, the city's health director said
Thursday. "At this point, in the event of an outbreak, we will use other
pesticides," said Health Commissioner Neal Cohen. "We will not use
malathion. It is not on the table. We will await the conclusion of the
EPA's review." The position is a reversal of the city's position last
summer. Then, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani approved widespread aerial and ground
spraying of the pesticide during an outbreak of the West Nile encephalitis
virus that killed six people and infected 62 others. Four of those deaths
and 45 of the cases occurred in the city. Thousands of birds and other
animals were also killed.
During several rounds of aerial citywide spraying, Giuliani, Cohen and
other officials repeatedly told people that the pesticide was safe,
although they cautioned that residents should try to stay indoors during
spraying. Many residents, however, were doused with the chemical during
times that spraying had not been scheduled. Dozens of people complained
that the malathion caused rashes and flare-ups of asthma and other
respiratory illnesses. As recently as January, Cohen refused to rule out
the possible use of malathion and in the health department's report
released Thursday on its plan to prevent another outbreak of encephalitis
this year, no mention is made of suspending the use of the pesticide.
Cohen's disclosure came during a hearing before the City Council's health
committee and in comments to reporters after the meeting. Instead of
malathion, the health department plans to use other pesticides, including
resmetrin, sumethrin and permethrin if spraying becomes necessary, Cohen
said.
The EPA did not confirm that it was reviewing malathion as a possible
carcinogen until earlier this year after complaints about its negative
health effects in New York, Florida and other areas. Steven Johnson, an
EPA assistant deputy administrator in charge of the program that regulates
pesticides, confirmed the agency's safety review of malathion. "Through
rigorous scientific analyses we have identified some issues as to whether
this compound causes cancer in laboratory animals and what this means for
people," Johnson said. "Up to now it was not classified as a human
carcinogen. But looking at data generated in recent years this issue has
arisen."
The safety study will likely not be completed until the end of summer.
While some environmentalists who had opposed the spraying last year cheered
the city's decision to suspend the use of malathion, the Sierra Club and
other groups called for a ban on all pesticide spraying. "We are calling on
the city to make sure that nontoxic preventative measures be done
consistently to contain the encephalitis virus," said Frank Eadie, the
group's conservation chairman. "We are very concerned that there are
significant health questions about resmethrin and d-phenothrin in addition
to malathion."
Cohen however, said the use of pesticides would be a last resort. The
city's plan to prevent an outbreak calls for testing for the presences of
the virus through the use of sentinel chickens and mosquito testing.
Beginning next week, the city will also release larvicide into the city's
storm drains, and later this spring, will expand its use of larvae-eating
"mosquito fish" in the city's waste water treatment plants. The city will
also embark on a public education campaign in which pamphlets in 11
languages urge people to unclog their roof gutters, drain or chlorinate
unused swimming pools and discard old tires.
