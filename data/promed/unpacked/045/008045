The number of infected farm workers in Bashkortostan has increased to
12 from previously reported 7 cases. The regional Rospotrebnadzor
[Federal Service for Consumer Protection and Human Welfare] official
has informed that the source of infections were cattle imported from
Kalmykia without propped documentation and veterinary control
measures.

All farm animals, around several hundreds head of cattle, have been
forwarded to the slaughterhouse. Initially, it was expected to use the
meat of the animals for processing after proper thermal treatment;
however, the director of the local meat processing factory has refused
to do so and dropped all the responsibility for dealing with the
infected meat.

[In fact, thermal treatment of beef (muscle tissue and fat, not
offal/specific organs which should be condemned) will practically take
care of consumer's health; however, slaughterhouse/processing plant
personnel may get exposed to infection unless severe precautionary
sanitary procedures are safeguarded. I know the statement above
(regarding consumers) will not be accepted by all, but this was
definitely my experience, including sheep suspected/infected by
_Brucella melitensis_ (again, provided specific organs are
condemned!). - Mod.AS]

[It is not stated in the posting if the diagnosis of brucellosis was
made clinically (usually based on an undifferentiated febrile illness
with known exposure to infected animals or unpasteurized dairy
products), serologically using a specific antibody test, or by
culture. Likewise, it is not specifically stated what exposures the
'farm workers' had to the bovine reservoir. - Mod.LL]

located in southwestern Russia. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
