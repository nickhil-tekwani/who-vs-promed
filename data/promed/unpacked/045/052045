26 people from Zabaykalye have been infected with _Trichinella_ after
eating bear meat. The majority of them are hunters and relatives and
friends of hunters. According to the Russian Sanitary surveillance
officer at the center of Chita, N. Rodina, 14 are from the village of
Tungokochen, and 12 are from Chita. The source of the infection was
bear meat, which is considered to be a special dish and which
contained _Trichinella_. In all, 65 people, including 9 children,
have eaten the meat from the infected bear.

60 people have trichinellosis in Tomsk (Molodejniy Kargasokskiy
district) after eating meat from a _Trichinella_-infected bear. It is
the 1st time a mass outbreak of trichinellosis has been registered in
Tomsk. The bear was illegally shot and slaughtered without proper
veterinary inspection. A veterinarian and a local police officer are
among the infected people.

[It is interesting to note that this outbreak took place in 2
different cities but within the same Siberian Federal District of
Russia simultaneously. Zabaykalye is a new administrative region of
Russia established in March 2008 as a result of merging the towns of
Chita and Aginsk. In both cases, bear meat was the source of the
_Trichinella_, and it is possible that the source of the meat was the
same animal. - Mod.NR]

[Bear meat is apparently distributed through informal supply chains
without proper inspection. _Trichinae_ are not a problem if the meat
is sufficiently cooked, but if used uncooked -- in sausages, for
example -- _Trichinae_ can remain infective for years. The arctic
strain of _Trichinella_ (_Trichinella native_) is resistant to freezing.
