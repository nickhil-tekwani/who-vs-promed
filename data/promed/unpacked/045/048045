Bovine anaplasmosis, Croatia
----------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 2 Aug 2018 from Dr Damir Tudan, assistant to minister, chief veterinary officer, Veterinary and Food Safety Directorate, CRO Ministry of Agriculture, Zagreb, Croatia

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 10 Jul 2018
Date of confirmation of the event: 2 Aug 2018
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease in the country
Causal agent: _Anaplasma marginale_
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (basic, advanced), necropsy
This event pertains to a defines zone within the country.

New outbreaks: 1
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Zaloj, Zaloj, Glina, Sisacko-Moslavacka
Date of start of the outbreak: 10 Jul 2018
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 48 / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle/ 2.08 / 2.08 / 100 / 2.08
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: In the framework of general passive surveillance a necropsy was performed on one dead cattle. Tissue samples were taken and testing of a spleen sample revealed positive to _Anaplasma spp._ Later, sequencing was performed and the result was positive to _Anaplasma marginale_. This is the first case of anaplasmosis in cattle officially confirmed in Croatia.

Control measures
Measures applied: vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Croatian Veterinary Institute (national laboratory) / Cattle / gene sequencing/ 2 Aug 2018 / Positive
Croatian Veterinary Institute (national laboratory) / Cattle / nested RT-PCR/ 2 Aug 2018 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["Bovine anaplasmosis results from infection with _Anaplasma marginale_. A 2nd species, _A. centrale_, has long been recognised and usually causes benign infections. _A. marginale_ is responsible for almost all outbreaks of clinical disease. _A. phagocytophilum_ and _A. bovis_, which infect cattle, have been recently included within the genus but they are not reported to cause clinical disease. The organism is classified in the genus _Anaplasma_ belonging to the family Anaplasmataceae of the order Rickettsiales.

Anaemia, jaundice, and sudden death are characteristic signs of anaplasmosis. Other signs include rapid loss of milk production and weight, but the clinical disease can only be confirmed by identifying the organism. Once infected, cattle may remain carriers for life, and identification of these animals depends on the detection of specific antibodies using serological tests, or of rickettsial DNA using molecular amplification techniques. The disease is typically transmitted by tick vectors, but mechanical transmission by biting insects or by needle can occur."
