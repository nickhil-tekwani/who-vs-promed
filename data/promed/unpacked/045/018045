Background data on echinococcosis in Kazakhstan
-----------------------------------------------
The highest rates of echinococcosis are reported from the southern
region. The rates of surgical disease have been increasing since
1990. See graph at <http://exhibit.gideononline.com/Echinococcosis-kaz.jpg>.
Approximately 100 to 200 cases per year were reported during 1974 to
1990 (0.9 to 1.4 per 100 000). 39 cases were reported among children
in 1993, and 112 in 1997. In 2000, 29 percent of cases reported were
in children below age 14 years, with rates of 5.9 per 100 000.
Prevalence surveys: 5.8 percent of village dogs and 23.2 percent of
shepherd dogs are infected
Seroprevalence surveys: 3.1 percent of the population in southern
Kazakhstan are infected, and 6.1 percent of shepherds. Infected
rodents (_Ondrata zibethica_) are found in the Illi and Karatal river
valleys and surrounding lake regions. Infected _Rhombomys opimus_ are
present in oasis settlements, desert hills and areas of sand and clay
deserts. Infected soil is identified in the rural south.
