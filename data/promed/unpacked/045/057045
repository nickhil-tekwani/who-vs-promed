The Timiskaming Health Unit is investigating 7 cases of whooping cough (pertussis), with exposures at Ecole Catholique Sainte-Croix, Ecole Catholique St-Michel, and Ecole Secondaire Catholique Sainte-Marie. Public Health Nurses are contacting parents and guardians of students who have the highest risk of exposure.

Check with your health care provider or the Timiskaming Health Unit to ensure you and your family are up to date on your whooping cough (pertussis) vaccination. The vaccine is free in Canada and part of the routine immunization schedule for infants, children, and teenagers. The vaccine is given at 2, 4, 6, and 18 months of age. A booster dose is needed between 4 and 6 years of age and again at 14-16 years of age. Immunity decreases over time, therefore one booster dose of vaccine is recommended for adults. You may review your immunization record online at (http://timiskaminghu.com/281/Immunization).

Pregnant or immunocompromised individuals should follow-up with their healthcare provider to confirm their history of vaccination against whooping cough (pertussis). A booster of the pertussis vaccine is recommended for all pregnant women in their 3rd trimester.

If you develop symptoms of whooping cough in the next 21 days, please follow-up with your healthcare provider and notify the Timiskaming Health Unit. For further information or if you have any comments or concerns, please call the Timiskaming Health Unit at 705-647-4305 or toll free at 1-866-747-4305.

East Penn students in elementary, middle, and high schools have been diagnosed with pertussis, or whooping cough, the district informed parents in a letter [Thu 14 Nov 2019].

The letters were sent to the parents of students at Emmaus High School, Lower Macungie Middle School, and Wescosville and Shoemaker elementary schools. They noted that a student in the school was diagnosed with pertussis and was under a physician's care. "At this time, there is not an ongoing public health threat," said Brittany Lauffer, a spokeswoman for the state Health Department.

District spokeswoman Laura Groh said in an email that at least one of the infected students was fully vaccinated. "Just because students get the vaccination, does not guarantee they will not get it," she wrote. Pertussis vaccines are effective but not perfect, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Lehigh County has the highest rates of pertussis in the state, according to the Health Department -- 30.5 pertussis cases per 100 000 people, according to 2015 to 2017 data posted on the department's website. Northampton County had a lower rate, at 11.5 cases per 100 000 people.

Wallingford-Swarthmore School District officials are urging parents and caregivers to be on the lookout for any signs of whooping cough, a highly contagious respiratory disease. The precautionary notices were issued based on 7 confirmed cases of the disease involving district students since the start of 2019.

On [15 Nov 2019], the principals of several schools, including Strath Haven high school and middle school and Swarthmore-Rutledge Elementary School, advised families their children could have been exposed to whooping cough, also known as pertussis. That was followed by a broader notice from Superintendent Lisa Palmer on [22 Nov 2019] providing additional details about the situation. "All of the confirmed cases are under the care of their physicians," she wrote. "We have been assured that they are either in process of completing the appropriate course of antibiotics or have already done so. Confirmed cases of pertussis have increased nationally over the past few years. Our district's identified cases are reflective of this national increase."

Prior to wide availability of pertussis vaccines in the 1940s, roughly 200 000 children were sickened with the disease each year, resulting in about 9000 fatalities, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Now, the number of cases reported annually in the US ranges from 10 000 to 40 000. In 2017, for example, the CDC reported there were 18 975 cases and 13 fatalities in a nation of more than 330 million. A recent peak year for whooping cough was 2012 when there were 48 277 cases identified in the US -- the largest number since 1955 when there were 62 786.

"Since learning of each confirmed case, we have worked closely with the PA [Pennsylvania] Department of Health to ensure that all procedures and protocols related to pertussis are implemented," Palmer stated, adding that the district has stepped up its cleaning and is using a disinfectant known to be effective against the disease.

There are new concerns as a highly contagious illness spreads in the Tri-State [Cincinnati metropolitan area, including Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana].

Cases of pertussis, or whooping cough, are rapidly spreading. Springboro Schools sent a letter home to parents saying 26 cases of whooping cough have been confirmed at the schools so far. 17 of them have been treated and those students have been released to go back to school.

Springboro Schools spokesman Scott Marshall said those treated stayed home for at least 5 days, but they want to let the community know that they are recommending vaccinations for families because to very young children and also to older adults, this illness can be life-threatening.

Clackamas County health officials see twice as many with whooping cough this year [2019] than they did in 2018. More than 46 cases of pertussis have been reported in the county this year [2019] and 2 in West Linn.

With cold and flu season officially underway, health officials in Clackamas County and the tri-county region [Clackamas, Multnomah, and Washington counties] have observed an uptick in cases of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, since July [2019].

As of the week of [4 Nov 2019], between 45-50 cases of pertussis have been reported to the county, which is double the number of cases [in 2019 than] last year [2018].

Of those, most have been school-age children. On [7 Nov 2019], the Clackamas Community Health Division released a statement to West Linn High School students citing a case of pertussis.

"There have been a few cases, I believe, at West Linn High School and there have been a number of cases at several high schools in the county and in the region," said Dr Sarah Present, a Clackamas County health officer. [On 20 Nov 2019] the district announced another case at Bolton Primary School.

"We are in a hot year for pertussis and we know that we have a communitywide spread of it, and we actually have more cases of it in Clackamas than we do in the other 2 counties (Multnomah and Washington) in our region with which we share data."

According to Present, pertussis is unusual in that it is hard to initially diagnose because its earliest symptoms are the same as the common cold. It isn't until the 2nd week of infection that more aggressive symptoms begin to manifest. "Whooping cough does follow 3- to 5-year waves, and we're at a time to have an uptick in pertussis. The amount that we've had, in Clackamas County, in particular, has been the most we've had in many, many years," Present said.

"And it is at many elementary schools and middle schools. But when we have a case that's seen at a school, we know that those are places where kids, many of whom are going to be susceptible to getting it, are in close contact with other kids, so it's a high-risk for transmission place," she said. "When we do have cases, we want to make sure that the whole school community that could have been exposed to know that they could have been exposed."

"There are a few misconceptions or misperceptions about pertussis that are important to know," Present said. "One thing we have noticed is that while the pertussis vaccine is a recommended health vaccine and most people are vaccinated, and it is absolutely the best way of protecting against pertussis, it's not 100% and the immunity does wane over time. So, we recommend a pertussis booster around 11 or 12 years old, and not as many people get that booster."

Present stressed that getting the vaccine is by far the best way to protect against contracting pertussis, but she also said everyone's immunities are different and having been vaccinated is not a protection guarantee. In order to protect other students and the community, Present recommends those who have been exposed to pertussis to stay home if they start to show signs of getting sick, even if they are mild, and to get tested by a healthcare provider. If a case is confirmed, County officials caution that the patient should stay home until they've completed a full course of antibiotics.
