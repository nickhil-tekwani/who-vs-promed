Taronga Zoo elephant diagnosed with TB
--------------------------------------
One of the stars of Sydney's Taronga Zoo, an 18-year-old Asian
elephant, has been diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB). The Asian
elephant, named Pak Boon, has been diagnosed with the illness which
keepers believe she bought with her when she came from Thailand 4 years ago.

She was tested for the bug [bacterium] when she came to Australia,
but tests at the time came up negative.

Pak Boon gave birth 3 months ago to a female calf, Tuka. Her handlers
say the pregnancy almost certainly brought on the illness, which the
zoo's vet says can be quite common in elephants and can lie dormant
in their system for years. The baby has tested negative for TB, as
have the 7 other elephants resident at the zoo.

Pak Boon is still on display and has not been quarantined, with staff
saying she does not pose a risk to members of the public.

[Tuberculosis is very difficult to diagnose, especially in elephants.
The elephants must be trained to allow trunk washes, where a small
amount of a solution is squirted up their trunk and then suctioned
back out. This is likely an unpleasant feeling for the elephant,
hence why they must be trained to accept this procedure. It takes
several trunk washes to do one test. The bacterium _Mycobacterium
tuberculosis_ or _M. bovis_ are both very very slow growers.
Elephants are susceptible to both of these organisms and this article
does not tell us which organism has caused the infection in Pak Boon.

The United States Animal Health Association published "Guidelines for
the Control of TB in Elephants 2008," which may be found at:
<http://www.elephantcare.org/protodoc_files/2008/TBGuidelines.pdf>

It is possible for the organism to remain dormant until such stress
as a pregnancy. So long as the elephant is not in contact with the
public, she may be able to be on display. Hopefully the elephant has
been put on treatment, which is usually with the same medication
humans are treated.

An accurate weight must be obtained on the animal to be treated as
the drugs are dosed based on weight and estimating a weight may mean
the elephant does not get enough drug to treat the infection or gets
too much drug which, depending on the drug of choice may have
consequences. Some drugs are organism specific. For example, PZA or
pyrazinamide is effective against _M. tuberculosis_ but not
_M.bovis_. Likewise the route of administration is important. For
example ETH or ethambutol can only be given orally while both INH or
isoniazid and PZA may be given either rectally or orally. Another
drug of choice may also be rifampin (RIF). Most elephants are treated
for at least one year.

It is important to accurately weigh, treat and monitor the elephants
on treatment. Multidrug resistant TB has been found in people, and at
least one case in an elephant in the US has been documented.
Inadequate treatment most often occurs with single drug therapy.

Infected elephants may represent a source of infection to people and
those in direct contact with the elephant, should protect themselves. - Mod.TG]
