Banana growing in Kikandwa sub-county, Mityana district, has been affected
by the continued spread of the banana wilt disease.

George Mugerwa, the sub-county chairman, said recently that efforts by
National Agricultural Advisory Services (NAADS) to promote banana
production in the area have been frustrated by the wilt. He said the NAADS
service providers have done little to sensitise farmers about control
measures and to teach them better farming practices. "Some farmers are
still practising traditional farming methods," Mugerwa said. "Though NAADS
programmes prohibit intervention of political leaders, we feel sad when we
see government's plan of reducing poverty being jeopardised," he said.

Salongo Kakembo, a farmer in Kasejjere, said fluctuating prices, high costs
of production and poor marketing strategies are frustrating their efforts.
"Some seeds offered to farmers do not come in time, forcing us to plant
off-season," Kakembo said.

[_Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _musacearum_ is the causal organism of banana
bacterial wilt (BBW) in Uganda and other East African countries. It also
causes a wilt disease of the local root staple food enset (_Ensete_
species, family _Musaceae_) in Ethiopia. The pathogen affects all banana
types and causes wilting and premature ripening of the fruit. An incidence
of 70-80 per cent in many plantations and yield losses of up to 90 per cent
have been reported.

In Uganda, the disease started in Mukono district in 2001 and has been
spreading since. BBW has inflicted damage by reducing cropped area by 13
per cent between 2001 and 2004, causing production to decline by between 65
and 80 per cent in the affected areas. Conservative estimates indicate an
annual USD 4 billion loss if BBW is not controlled. The disease is a
significant concern in the region jeopardising food security.

The pathogen survives in soil and plant debris and is mainly spread via
infected planting material, insect vectors, mechanical means, and
contaminated farm tools. A range of alternate crop and weed hosts including
cereals, cabbage, tobacco, and ornamentals may serve as pathogen
reservoirs. Farmers using disease management techniques such as removal and
burning of all diseased plants, removal of spent male flowers and use of
clean tools have been successful in reducing the number of new infections.

Different banana bacterial wilts including Moko, bugtok, and blood diseases
are found in Asia and southern American regions and are caused by members
of the _Ralstonia solanacearum_ species complex (for more information see
ProMED-mail post no. 20070513.1524).
