Jordan finds new case of anthrax infection
------------------------------------------
Jordan found a new death case caused by anthrax among animals, the
4th case in the past 3 weeks, local daily The Jordan Times reported
on Tuesday [16 Dec 2008].

A stray cat on Monday was found dead of anthrax in a housing area in
Dulayl near Zarqa, close to a livestock farm which was quarantined
following the discovery of anthrax-infected cattle early last month
[November 2008], according to a source familiar with the case.

"Despite the ministry's efforts to contain the problem, the situation
is alarming and needs to be tackled," cautioned the source on Monday
[15 Dec 2008]. Monitoring procedures need to be intensified in the
area to prevent the bacteria from spreading to residential
neighborhoods, added the source, without giving his name.

Another source who also declined to be named said further cases of
anthrax-infected livestock may exist but go undetected as farmers do
not report them to the ministry. "Instead, they dispose the dead
animals in the open, which results in stray cats becoming infected," he said.

On Sunday [14 Dec 2008], Minister of Agriculture Muzahim Muhaisin
claimed at a Lower House meeting that no new anthrax cases have been
found among cattle since the discovery of an infected cow in Dulayl
one month ago.

[Anthrax in domestic cats is rare. Off the top of my head I cannot
remember a previous case. The disease is being seen increasing
frequency, though still not everyday, in wild felidae in African game
parks with anthrax, and especially in lions. It is essentially an
oral infection and felines are relatively resistant. Obviously there
is more to this than meets the eye as well as the suspecion that if
this cat had not died AND been diagnosed -- sending in a dead stray
cat for necropsy and analysis is unusual to say the least -- we would
not be reading this report. If a cat got exposed (how?), we may
confidently expect that local stray dogs were similarly exposed and
probably died as they do and it would have been more than one.

Since the 1st bovine case in 10-14 Nov 2008 it would seem that the
outbreak is continuing -- "the 4th case in the past 3 weeks" -- in
spite of any control procedures by the Ministry of Agriculture
veterinary service.
