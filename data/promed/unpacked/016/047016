Russia: outbreak of rubella among students at Volgograd Academy
---------------------------------------------------------------
Fifty-seven students of the Volgograd Law Academy of the Ministry of
Internal Affairs have contracted rubella (German measles). All students are
first and second year students, who live in student accommodation at the
academy. The first 3 patients were admitted [presumably to hospital,
unusually for what is generally regarded as a mild illness, although
arthralgia and encephalitis are commoner in adults than children. - Mod.SH]
with rubella in March, but in the past 2 days there is an marked increase
in the number of referrals.
At the present time, students diagnosed and confirmed with rubella are in
quarantine and do not live on the premises of Academy. For 21 days all
rooms of in the student residence will be disinfected, and other places
where students usually meet will be disinfected with quartz [UV?} lamps.
The Sanitary Epidemiological Surveillance Center will conduct all necessary
measures to prevent the spread of infection.

[This article provides no information regarding the suspected source of the
outbreak. Outbreaks of rubella among young adults were not uncommon before
the introduction and widespread use of the triple measles, mumps, and
rubella (MMR) vaccine. Inadequate vaccination cover may have played a role
in the initiation of this outbreak. - Mods.NR/CP]
