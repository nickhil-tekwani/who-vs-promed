[As we begin 2023 we wish everyone a happy new year. We also wish our Chinese friends, colleagues, and subscribers a happy lunar new year later this month [22 Jan 2023], the Year of the Rabbit. Hopefully, that is a good omen for our newest journal, IJID One Health, coming in early 2023. IJID One Health traverses human, animal, and environmental health, covering the domains of diagnoses/diagnostics, surveillance, epidemiology, public health capacities and interventions. - Mod.JH]
