[The following is the machine translation [edited] of the Ministry of Health statement, dated 3 Oct 2013, reproduced in 'Avian Flu Diary' http://afludiary.blogspot.ca/2013/10/indonesia-reports-194th-h5n1-case.html.

"The Ministry of Health, Directorate General of Disease Control and Environmental Health announced a new case of H5N1 has been confirmed by the Center for Biomedical and Healthcare Technology Association, Balitbangkes. The case on behalf of the US (male, 28 years) from Cibitung, Bekasi, West Java Province, was a driver for a bottled water company.

Chronology of the case: on 16 Sep 2013 the man presented fever, aches, and back pain. Then, on 18 Sep 2013, he was referred for outpatient treatment to one of the private hospitals in Bekasi. But because there was no improvement, the case went back for treatment and was admitted to the hospital on 20 Sep 2013. While in hospital care, the fever increased and was accompanied by cough and shortness of breath. On 25 Sep 2013 the disease became more severe, with higher fever and increased difficulty breathing, and the patient was placed in intensive care in the ICU. The next day, on 26 Sep 2013, avian influenza was suspected. On 27 Sep 2013, the patient was referred to the Friendship Hospital for treatment. However, the man died at about 20:10 pm on the same day.

Epidemiological investigations have been carried out by the Ministry of Health Integrated Team, the Ministry of Agriculture, Department of Animal Husbandry, the Health Department of West Java Province, the Department of Health, and the Bekasi District Veterinary Office, at the hospital, at the man's home and surrounding environment to determine possible risk factors for contact in the environment, such as ornamental birds and pigeons. Furthermore, approximately 50 m in front of the house there is an area used once a week as an arena for pigeon racing. In addition, in the neighborhood there are many birds, especially pigeons kept by the residents.

With this new case, the cumulative number of avian influenza cases in Indonesia, since 2005 until this news broadcast, is 194 cases with 162 deaths.

The Director General of Disease Control and Environmental Health, Prof Dr Tjandra Yoga Aditama, as the focal point for the International Health Regulations (IHR) has reported this case to the WHO."
