Surveillance update
---------------------
The current surveillance round in the Pest Quarantine Area (PQA) at Emerald
was completed on 19 Apr 2005. This is the 2nd surveillance round for the
Plant Quarantine Area (PQA), following completion of the 1st round in
July-August 2004 and confirmation of the citrus canker (CC) in Emerald.
This surveillance round, which commenced in November 2004, included all
commercial citrus, all non-commercial citrus, and selected native and
ornamental host species throughout the PQA. No CC was detected outside the
2 known infected properties, IP1 and IP2.
A 3rd round of surveillance will commence of all commercial citrus
properties in the PQA on 6 May 2005. This round of surveillance will cover
all commercial citrus trees in the PQA, i.e. there will be a tree-by-tree
inspection of all commercial citrus properties in the PQA. In addition,
further surveillance will be undertaken of non-commercial and native and
ornamental host species in the PQA during this round.
Further citrus canker detection on IP2:
A further confirmed detection of CC has been identified by National Citrus
Canker Eradication Program (NCCEP) surveillance staff in one of the final
blocks to be surveyed on IP2. The initial detection in this block was
similar to the previous detection on IP2, where susceptible rootstock
shoots have grown up through the canopy of the cultivated variety in the
block. The destruction zone around this new detection will comprise
approximately 39.6 ha or 20 000 commercial citrus trees. An epidemiological
study is currently being undertaken by NCCEP staff in and around the site
of the infection. Destruction of this new area will commence early next
week [final week April 2005], once the epidemiology study has been completed.
Destruction and disposal:
All trees in the previous destruction zones on IP2 have now been removed.
Burning of trees in the most recent destruction zone has commenced and is
expected to be completed by early next week [final week April 2005].
Cultivation is continuing in previous destruction zones on IP2 to ensure
any remaining host plant material is removed and disposed of.
National Management Group decision on destruction of remaining trees on IP2:
A decision has been made to destroy the remaining 70 000 citrus trees on
IP2 following the latest detection of CC on the property and agreement by
the National Management Group yesterday [21 Apr 2005] that the whole
property be deemed infested with the disease.
The decision to destroy the remaining trees on this property is based on
scientific evidence that indicates there is a high likelihood that the
remaining trees on the property have been exposed to CC, including through
normal management operations on the property. Removal of all citrus trees
on both known infested properties will mean nearly 600 000 trees will have
been destroyed to eradicate the CC outbreak in Emerald.

Fruit still moving out of quarantine area
-------------------------------------------
Domestic trade of fruit is still possible out of the quarantined
citrus-growing area in central Queensland, despite confirmation of a 5th
case of CC yesterday [21 Apr 2005]. The National Management Group ordered
the destruction of the remaining 70 000 trees on the 2PH Selma Road property.
But Chris Adriaansen from Queensland Biosecurity, says a resumption to
domestic trade will still be recommended next week [final week April 2005].
He said there's a difference between the infected properties and those 5
other properties within the PQA that have no evident CC infection. A pest
risk analysis indicated that any risk associated with the movement of fruit
from those 5 non-infected properties is completely within acceptable limits
and can be mitigated through inspection treatment and certification.

New citrus canker outbreak reported
-----------------------------------------
A 5th CC outbreak has been detected on 2PH farms in central Queensland,
according to owner John Pressler. "It's a scattered area, which would
encompass several acres, as have the previous ones, over a kilometer in any
direction from the previous ones," he said. According to Pressler, it would
appear that this is the 3rd finding that can be traced back to the rain
events of January and February 2005, and it has obviously been brought in
by wind during that period.

[Destruction of the remaining CC-infected citrus trees on IP2 is the only
appropriate management option. The evidence certainly suggests that heavy
winds in January and February 2005 were a major factor contributing to
dissemination of the bacterium (_Xanthomonas_ _axonopodis_ pv. _citri_) to
trees on the affected properties. The loss of nearly 600 000 CC-infected
trees dramatically illustrates the capability of the bacterium to wage
destruction on a massive scale. - Mod.DH]
