More cattle have been tested for foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) this
week in Brazil's southern Parana state, alarming local ranchers and
state government officials who fear more cases in local herds.
The Agriculture Ministry said Friday that blood test results from
8650 animals in Parana should be known next week.

Parana state's Animal Health Council said earlier this week that it
would round up an entire herd of 1800 cattle on a state ranch because
44 of the cattle were identified as carriers of FMD.
There are roughly 10.5 million head of cattle in Parana, and 205
million in Brazil. The country is the world's No. 1 beef exporter.
Parana's top agriculture officials and ranchers said federal
Technicians were "exaggerating" the results of previous blood tests
that showed FMD antibodies in the 44 cattle. The Agriculture Ministry
considered the cattle infected, meaning 2 States now have cattle with
the disease, including Mato Grosso do Sul where an outbreak was
detected 10 Oct 2005.
52 nations have either fully or partially banned beef imports From
Brazil because of FMD. Industry leaders worried bans would become
more expansive once Parana was added to list. Russia, Brazil's
2nd-largest beef market after the European Union, expanded its ban
from just Mato Grosso do Sul to cover most of the nation.
The 44 Parana cattle that tested positive for the antibodies were
purchased from a ranch in Mato Grosso do Sul in a region currently
infected with FMD.
Brazil's Agriculture Ministry has maintained that it is following
international standards for the control and eradication of FMD set by
the World Organization for Animal Health in Paris.

[Brazil would like to have its export markets returned and is
aggressively moving to eliminate the disease from the infected
states. It appears that the movement of the 44 cattle from Mato
Grosso do Sul may be part of the explanation for Parana having FMD.
The cessation of movement from infected areas is critical to rapid
containment of this disease. - Mod.TG]
