Chaffee County Health Department reported Fri 17 Jul 2015 that bubonic plague has been confirmed in a Chaffee County resident recently. The unidentified individual was hospitalized and has survived following intravenous antimicrobial treatment, Susan Ellis, county health director, wrote in a press release. Identification of the disease was made by the state public health laboratory 10 Jul 2015.

Colorado Department of Public Health reports that 17 human plague cases have been confirmed in Colorado since 2005. This would make the 18th case. Investigation revealed that the family dog became ill with symptoms consistent with plague a few days prior to the onset of illness in the dog's owner. The dog has recovered and test results from the dog are pending.

The incubation period for the bubonic plague is 1-6 days. Ellis said the infected individual was in Chaffee County during that time period, which made it clear she was in the county when she contracted the disease. The health department is conducting surveillance for rodent die-off and has posted warning signs about plague in the vicinity of the Little Rainbow Trailhead off CR 110.

A 16-year old boy from the Cherokee Park area in northern Colorado died from the septicemic form of the plague on 8 Jun 2015.

[As compared to cats, dogs are not considered to be significant in the transmission of _Yersinia pestis_ to humans. However, as underscored by the following paper, cases in canines do occur:

Orloski KA, Eidson M: Yersinia pestis infection in three dogs. J Am Vet Med Assoc. 1995;207: 316-318
Abstract:
"_Yersinia pestis_ infection was diagnosed in 3 dogs. Clinical signs included lethargy (3 dogs), pyrexia (2 dogs), and a purulent skin lesion in the cervical region (2 dogs). _Yersinia pestis_ infection is a potentially fatal zoonotic disease of human beings. Human cases have resulted from contact with infected domestic cats; however, the risk of human infection from contact with infected domestic dogs is unknown. Dogs frequently are exposed to _Y. pestis_ in areas in which there are plague epizootics; however, clinical illness in dogs is rare. In the western United States, where _Yersinia pestis_ is endemic, plague should be considered in the differential diagnosis when examining dogs with nonspecific fever and lethargy."

Indeed, a cluster of canine-related human cases of pneumonic plague with possible human to human spread occurred in Colorado in 2014 (Plague - USA: (CO) pneumonic, canine source, poss. human-to-human spread, 2014: 20150501.3335475). - Mod.LL
