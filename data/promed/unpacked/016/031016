Farmer falls victim to Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever
------------------------------------------------------
A patient with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) from northern
Tokat province succumbed to the disease at the Sivas hospital where
he was being treated.

According to the Anatolia news agency, a tick bit the 37-year-old
farmer while he was working in a field in a village in Tokat. He went
to a hospital in Tokat and hospital staff removed the tick. After
being released from the hospital he fell ill and went back to the
hospital. He was transferred to Sivas Cumhuriyet University Research
and Training Hospital, where he died despite medical attention.
Reports say the farmer, a father of 3, was buried in his village
yesterday [19 Aug 2008].

Mostly infecting animals, CCHF is a viral disease transmitted by
ticks. The virus can infect sheep and cattle in addition to humans
and is fatal if not detected and treated early. It has been
responsible for the deaths of more and more people in Turkey each
year since its first recorded incidence in Turkey in 2002.

[Between 2002 and 2007, a total of 1820 confirmed cases, including 92
deaths, were reported, showing an increasing trend over the years.
The majority of cases (95 percent) were reported from middle and
eastern Anatolia, particularly from Tokat, Sivas, Yozgat, Corum, and
Erzurum. Most of the cases were diagnosed between March and October,
with peak levels in June and July, which correspond with the tick
season. The average case fatality rate between 2002 and 2007 was 5
percent. 70 percent of the cases had a history of tick contact, while
most of the remaining 30 percent had a history of contact with
livestock, and 3 cases were attributed to nosocomial transmission
[see ProMED-mail Crimean-Congo hem. fever - Turkey (14): background
20080814.2530].

The 1st CCHF case in 2008 was detected and notified on 24 Mar 2008.
As of 30 Jun 2008, 688 confirmed cases have been reported. Of these,
41 patients have died due to CCHF, corresponding to a case fatality
rate of 5.96 percent. As in previous years, most of the cases were
from Middle and Eastern Anatolia (91 percent).

The unfortunate death described in the current report indicates that
transmission of CCHF from ticks is still occurring in rural areas of
the central Anatolian region.
