An English measles [i.e. as opposed to German measles] outbreak which
began early last month [February 2009] has now affected 13 Otago
people aged from 4 to 22 years. Medical Officer of Health for Otago
Southland Dr John Holmes said new cases could all be linked to the
original 4 that turned up in an unvaccinated family which had
traveled to Viet Nam in January 2009 [see ProMED-mail archive
references listed below].

Dr Holmes said he was keeping an open mind on the possibility of more
cases and that it was important that if doctors thought an illness
was measles that they order relevant blood tests. The illness
[measles] is considered rare in New Zealand, with 12 cases recorded
last year [2008].

Three of the new cases occurred in Logan Park High School pupils.
Parents and caregivers were notified last week by letter and provided
with information about the illness. None of those people who had
contracted the disease had required hospital treatment, Dr Holmes
said.

People needed to be aware they could have flu-like symptoms before
the rash appeared (between the 3rd and 7th day of the illness). They
are infectious from one day before the beginning of the 1st day of
illness until 4 days after the rash appears. The incubation period
for the illness is about 10 days, but it can take longer than that
for the rash to appear.

Logan Park High School principal Jane Johnson said one of the year 10
boys who had contracted the illness had been with a group on the
Spirit of New Zealand yacht and it was a matter of establishing who
within that group had not been immunised. The parents concerned had
been mindful about watching their children for signs of the illness.
The family involved in the original outbreak was not from the school.
Parents did not appear to be "at all over-anxious" about the matter.
The school had acted responsibly and was working closely with its
public health nurse. She was "pretty optimistic" the school was on
top of the problem.

Dr Holmes said it was a good time for parents to check whether their
children's vaccinations were up to date. About 85 percent of those
born since October 2005 have been vaccinated. Babies are considered
protected by their mother's antibodies and do not receive their 1st
vaccination until 15 months, followed by another dose at 4 years.

[The less than optimal level of measles vaccination in New Zealand is
leaving the country vulnerable to spread of disease following
introduction from elsewhere by immigrants or, in this case, by
travelers returning from endemic areas. There have yet to be more
cases in this outbreak.

Otago is located at the southern end of South Island, and the city of
Dunedin was the initial focus of the outbreak. - Mod.CP]
