The BBC has learned that a patient has been diagnosed with cholera in the Cuban capital, Havana, days after 3 people died in a rare outbreak in the southeastern town of Manzanillo. More than 50 people were infected and about 1000 have received medical attention.

Most of the cases were in Cuba's south-eastern Granma province, more than 750 km (470 mi) from Havana. Hundreds of medical professionals from that area, including nurses, have worked and continue to work with patients in Haiti, where tens of thousands of people were infected after a devastating earthquake in 2010.

But the BBC's Sarah Rainsford says that for over a week doctors in Havana have been doing the rounds of their patients, checking for symptoms of cholera. The infirm, elderly, and pregnant have been prioritised.

Now tests on a 60-year-old woman, admitted to hospital on Wed 4 Jul 2012 have confirmed that she has the disease. As she was diagnosed early, doctors say she is in a stable condition.

The Health Ministry said the last reported cholera outbreak on the island was soon after the 1959 Revolution.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall

[The total number of cases in Granma Province in the southern part of Cuba has been reported to be as few as 50 and as many as "thousands" with deaths of between 3 and 15 Cubans due to cholera.

This report confirms a case of cholera in the country's capital Havana, in La Habana Province in the northwest part of the island without reported cases in the area between the provinces. It is not stated if the index case in Havana is an O1 _V. cholerae_ or one of the non-O1, non-O139 _V. cholerae_ that generally (but not always) cause less diarrhea and are not thought to cause substantial outbreaks. - Mod.LL
