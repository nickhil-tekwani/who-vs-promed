Epidemiological summary

- 56 new suspected cases were reported in epi week 27, 2022 (4 -10 Jul 2022) from 22 states: Katsina (12), Gombe (7), Adamawa (6), Bauchi (5), Bayelsa (3), Ondo (3), Delta (2), Edo (2), Lagos (2), Plateau (2), Abia (1), Anambra (1), Borno (1), Enugu (1), Kaduna (1),Kebbi (1), Kogi (1), Kwara (1), Nasarawa (1), Ogun (1), Oyo (1), and Taraba (1).

- 17 of the 56 suspected cases were confirmed positive in epi week 27, 2022 from 12 states: Ondo (3), Adamawa (2), Bayelsa (2), Delta (2), Anambra (1), Borno (1), Edo (1), Gombe (1), Katsina (1), Kogi (1), Plateau (1), and Lagos (1).

- From 1 Jan to 10 Jul 2022, there have now been 301 suspected cases and 101 confirmed cases (65 male, 36 female) from 23 states: Lagos (14), Adamawa (11), Delta (9), Nasarawa (7), Edo (7), Bayelsa (7), Rivers (6), Plateau (6), FCT (5), Ondo (5), Cross River (3), Kwara (3), Borno (3), Imo (2), Kano (2), Taraba (2), Anambra (2), Katsina (2), Niger (1), Oyo (1), Ogun (1), Kogi (1), and Gombe (1).

- Three deaths were recorded from 3 states: Delta (1), Lagos (1), and Ondo (1).

- Overall, since the re-emergence of monkeypox in September 2017 and to 10 Jul 2022, a total of 813 suspected cases have been reported from 35 states in the country.

- Of these 813 suspected cases, 327 (40.9%) have been confirmed, from 29 states: Rivers (58), Bayelsa (50), Lagos (44), Delta (38), Cross River (17), Edo (17), FCT (11), Adamawa (11), Imo (10), Nasarawa (9), Plateau (9), Akwa Ibom (7), Oyo (7), Ondo (5), Enugu (4), Anambra (4), Abia (3), Kwara (3), Borno (3), Benue (2), Ekiti (2), Kano (2), Niger (2), Ogun (2), Taraba (2), Katsina (2), Ebonyi (1), Gombe (1), and Kogi (1).

- In addition, from September 2017 to 10 Jul 2022, a total of 11 deaths have been recorded (case fatality rate 3.5% [11/327 suggests 3.4%. - Mod.SH]) in 6 states: Lagos (3), Edo (2), Imo (1), Cross River (1), FCT (1), Rivers (1), Ondo (1), and Delta (1).

- We have seen an increase in monkeypox cases. We have now passed the peak number of cases seen in 2017 when MPX re-emerged. However, we believe ongoing efforts to strengthen surveillance, increased awareness from global news headlines, and our investments in risk communication and community engagement have also contributed in part or whole to this observed increase in cases. We will continue to monitor the situation even as we sustain ongoing response efforts.

Notes on this report
-------------
Data source:

Information for this disease was case-based data retrieved from the National Monkeypox Emergency Operations Centre.

Case definitions:

Suspected case
- An acute illness with fever greater than 38.3 deg C [100.9 deg F], intense headache, lymphadenopathy, back pain, myalgia, and intense asthenia followed one to 3 days later by a progressively developing rash often beginning on the face (most dense) and then spreading elsewhere on the body, including soles of feet and palms of the hand

Probable case
- A case that meets the clinical case definition and is not laboratory confirmed but has an epidemiological link to a confirmed case

Confirmed case
- A clinically compatible case that is laboratory confirmed

Contact
- Any person who has been in direct or indirect contact with a confirmed case since the onset of symptoms, i.e., contact with skin lesions, oral secretions, urine, faeces, vomitus, blood, sexual contact, sharing a common space (anyone who has been in proximity with or without physical contact with a confirmed case)

Calculations
- Case fatality rate (CFR) for this disease is reported for confirmed cases only.

[Monkeypox cases continue to increase in Nigeria. There are 17 new cases in epi week 27. The monkeypox virus clearly is endemic in Nigeria. Cases occur sporadically throughout the year and across the country except in the far northeast. The report above does not indicate which of the 2 clades of MPX virus are responsible for the cases. The reported case fatality rate of 3.7% [11/301] is higher than the usual 1% for the West African clade but lower than the up to 10% for the Central African clade.

This report or previous ones do not indicate if the reported cases are due to person-to-person transmission or to contact with infected wild mammals. As noted earlier, monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Studies of the prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp, an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ (giant pouched rat) and _Graphiurus_ (African dormice). Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected. MPX virus has been shown to be transmitted between people in Africa, but not readily. - Mod.TY
