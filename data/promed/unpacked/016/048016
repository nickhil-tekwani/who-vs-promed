ANTIBIOTICS & HUMAN LEPTOSPIROSIS (4)
======================================
In reply to Dr.Stanchi,
Yes, penicillin is usually considered the drug of choice. However, as Ben
Adlet pointed out, in the study by my colleague Charlie Edwards here in
Barbados, penicillin was of little value in our patients, who generally
present to medical attention late in the course of their disease, well
into the immune phase, and almost invariably with jaundice and most often
renal failure as well.
The study by McClain et al, was conducted using doxycycline 100mg bds for
7 days, in US military personnel presenting with fever on return from
jungle training in Panama. Clearly these cases were detected much earlier
than those in the Barbados study of penicillin. In the doxycyline study,
patients with "illness severe enough to threaten life" were excluded from
the trial. This is a further contrast with the Barabods study, where all
out lepto patients were included and we have a mortality rate of about
10%.
Both penicillin and doxycycline were shown however to prevent
leptospiruria or reduce its duration significantly. This alone is
probably a good reason for using antibioitcs at whatever stage the
patient presents or leptospirosis is considered.
