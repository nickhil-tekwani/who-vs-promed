Alberta Health Services [AHS] says it is investigating an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in the Calgary area. Six cases have been reported so far, AHS said.

The agency is holding a news conference later today [7 Dec 2012] but says its investigation is focusing on finding potential sources of exposure to the bacteria, _Legionella_, which cause Legionnaires' disease.

The disease leads to a severe, sometimes fatal form of pneumonia. It is contracted through inhalation of contaminated water droplets and is not known to be transmitted from person to person.

Officials continue to investigate what caused an outbreak of legionellosis in Calgary. Alberta Health Services has confirmed 6 cases of legionellosis, also known as Legionnaires' disease, all reported within a roughly 16 km radius in southwest Calgary.

Medical Officer of Health Dr. Judy MacDonald said Friday [7 Dec 2012] that the patients were both male and female and range in age from 51 to 78. They all live or work in the same area. "The investigation that we've done to date has certainly involved inspecting the apartments and work places where these cases reside or work, looking for anything that was unusual for their water systems, heating, plumbing," said MacDonald. "That all checked out."

Despite the concentrated area, MacDonald said none of the 6 patients know each other, and officials are at a bit of a loss as to how they were exposed to the bacteria.

All 6 cases have experienced pneumonia and were admitted to the hospital but are on the mend, health officials said. "There's been some of the cases that have been severely ill, right up to the level of intensive care," said Dr. John Conly, infectious disease specialist. "I'm pleased to report all the patients are recovering at this point in time."

Legionnaires' disease can develop in humans when water containing high concentrations of the _Legionella_ bacteria are aerosolized through things like showers, fountains and humidifiers. MacDonald said it's important to remind Calgarians that the bacteria can't be transmitted person-to-person.

Since 2004, there have been 39 cases of Legionellosis in the Calgary region.

[Legionellosis is an infectious disease caused usually by inhalation of aerosols containing _Legionella_ species. Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of legionellosis; more than 70 percent of cases of legionnaires' disease are due to _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1, except in Australia and New Zealand, where _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 has accounted for only 45.7 percent of cases of community-acquired legionellosis, and _Legionella longbeachae_ has accounted for 30.4 percent of cases (Yu VL, et al: Distribution of _Legionella_ species and serogroups isolated by culture in patients with sporadic community-acquired legionellosis: An international collaborative survey. J Infect Dis. 2002; 186(1): 127-8. Available at: http://www.legionella.org/lp_distribution.pdf). Legionnaires' disease due to _L. longbeachae_ has been associated with the use of potting soil and gardening.

Legionnaires' disease attacks more frequently and is more severe in individuals who are elderly, smokers, alcoholics, or who have an underlying illness such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or who have a weakened immune system as a result of, for example, organ transplant or taking immunosuppressive drugs (such as, corticosteroid therapy) for other reasons. However, it is important to emphasize that relatively healthy individuals can also be at risk of contracting the disease.

A diagnosis of even a single case of Legionnaires' disease implies the presence of an environmental source to which other susceptible individuals are likely to have been exposed. It is, therefore, a public health imperative to find that source to prevent further cases.

Genotyping of patient and environmental isolates has become a helpful tool to establish transmission pathways. The predominance of one genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from patient specimens would suggest transmission from a common source. Because _Legionella_ may be found in environmental samples without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative infectious reservoir can be confirmed by matching the genotype of clinical and environmental isolates (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/).

However, this is difficult in legionellosis outbreaks, because, frequently, the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease is made only on the basis of urinary _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen testing or serology rather than isolation of the organism from cultures of respiratory tract specimens. Consequently, clinical isolates are often not available for genotyping. The news reports above do not say how the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease was made or give the species of _Legionella_ that was implicated in the 6 cases reported in the Calgary outbreak.

Calgary, with a population of 1 096 833, is a city in the province of Alberta, Canada east of the front ranges of the Canadian Rockies, with a relatively high elevation (1084 meters or 3557 feet above sea level) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary). Calgary endures very cold winters. Economic activity in Calgary is mostly centered on the oil and gas industry and agriculture.
