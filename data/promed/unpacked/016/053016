India: 3 fatal cases of suspected Japanese encephalitis in Manipur
-----------------------------------------------
Of 6 female and 2 male patients admitted to the Shija Hospital and Research
Institute, Langol, for treatment of suspected Japanese encephalitis, 3
persons, including 2 women, failed to respond to treatment [died]. The
remaining 5 are reported to be in serious condition at the same institute.
Blood samples [have been sent to] Kolkata NIC for verification.
Dr. Kh Palin of the Langol Institute said the 8 patients with
suspected Japanese encephalitis were admitted to the Institute last
week [1st week of July 2004]. The 1st patients to arrive at the
institute were a 13-year-old girl, from Nagaram area, and a
50-year-old woman from Wangkhei Tokpam Leikai. The 2 were soon joined
by 6 others with similar infections. Among the patients presently at
the Institute include a brother and sister from Wangkhei Keithel
Ashangbi area. Other patients, who have been placed on oxygen, are
from Keikhu, Soibam Leikai, Irom Meijrao, and Chakpikarong areas. Dr.
Palin declared that these areas should be on red alert, and he
recommended that [mosquito control measures] should be undertaken
urgently, as Manipur is highly susceptible to outbreaks of
[mosquito-borne] diseases, especially during the rainy season.
Dr. Palin stated that about 56 persons had died some years back with
symptoms similar to those of Japanese encephalitis. [Disease control
guidelines recommend] the use of a Japanese encephalitis virus vaccine for
persons residing in areas where the disease is endemic or epidemic.

[ProMED-mail does not usually post reports of Japanese encephalitis in India,
since it is endemic there. However, this press report suggests obliquely that
outbreaks of fatal disease have not occurred in Manipur for some years. -
