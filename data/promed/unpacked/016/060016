[1] Mandatory vaccinations
Date: Wed 10 Apr 2019
Source: STAT News [abridged, edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2019/04/10/can-officials-require-vaccinations-against-measles-a-century-old-case-may-give-them-a-foothold/


When New York's health department announced this week that it would mandate vaccinations in parts of Brooklyn to quell a ballooning measles outbreak, it was not the 1st to take such a step. In fact, its legal basis for the rare effort may be predicated on the actions of Massachusetts authorities who tried -- and succeeded -- in doing so over a century ago.

In 1902, a Massachusetts man defied an order to be vaccinated against smallpox despite the fact the dangerous disease -- since eradicated, thanks to vaccine -- was spreading in Cambridge. The fight that ensued between the Rev. Henning Jacobson and public health authorities became a pillar on which public health powers have relied since the Supreme Court handed down its ruling in the state's favor 3 years later.

Whether that legal precedent will actually convince 21st century courts that New York's actions are justifiable today likely will be tested. But one thing is clear: The question of whether mandating vaccinations is the right way to try to end the spread of measles among Orthodox Jews in Williamsburg is already a source of debate in the public health law community.

"I could see it going either way," said Lindsay Wiley, a law professor at American University Washington College of Law, when asked whether New York had the legal authority to require vaccination of all people in 4 specific Williamsburg zip codes. "The Supreme Court precedent is long-standing but also from a time period when constitutional law was not understood in the terms and through the frameworks that the courts now use."

In Jacobson's case -- the reverend was fined USD5 for failing to comply with a vaccination order -- the Supreme Court ruled that individual rights must at times give way to the common good. "On any other basis, organized society could not exist with safety to its members," the court decreed. "Society based on the rule that each one is a law unto himself would soon be confronted with disorder and anarchy."

That argument should hold in the modern era in a case in which a state faces a public health threat from measles, said Donna Levin, national director of the Network for Public Law Health and former general counsel for the Massachusetts Department of Health. "It's a seminal public health law case where you are balancing the common good against the autonomy of the individual and the court lays out the principles of how you have to balance that," said Levin.

The outbreak in Williamsburg is the largest of several measles epidemics underway across the country; so far this year 465 cases have been recorded nationally. Just 4 months into 2019, that is already the 2nd biggest tally in a single year in at least 2 decades.

The Williamsburg outbreak stretches back to last October [2018], when an unvaccinated child contracted the virus during a visit to Israel and returned home while still infectious. As of [Mon 8 Apr 2019], there had been 285 cases in affected parts of Brooklyn and Queens. In 2017, the city recorded 2 cases of measles, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio noted on [Tue 9 Apr 2019].

Earlier this week, the city warned it could fine or even close yeshivas -- Jewish religious schools -- that do not follow the health department's order to exclude unvaccinated children from school while the outbreak is underway.

The mandatory vaccination order -- part of a broader order declaring the outbreak a public health emergency -- applies to adults and children. That in itself is unusual, Wiley said, noting most mandatory vaccination policies apply only to children. The exceptions are members of the military, health workers during medical emergencies, and sometimes college students, she said.

Dr. Oxiris Barbot, New York's health commissioner, said violation of the order could result in a fine of USD1000. When asked what would happen if someone persistently refused to be vaccinated, she sidestepped the question, saying the department would consult with its lawyers. The order, however, warns that the penalty for violations could include imprisonment.

Excerpt
-------
Introduction
Most of us have spent our entire lives hearing the same story about vaccines. We are told that thanks to vaccines, deadly diseases have been eradicated and millions of lives have been saved. We are warned that if we stop vaccinating, the diseases will come back with a vengeance. Instead of receiving an accurate picture of vaccine effectiveness and risks, we receive an oversimplified yet frightening portrayal of disease dangers, while the risk of vaccine-injury or death is written off as "one in a million?

A lot of the information we receive about vaccines and the diseases they are meant to prevent is true. However, much of it is misleading by virtue of omission. On the other hand, some of what we are told about vaccines is simply untrue. In this publication, we have undertaken the job of filling in the huge information gap and discerning fact from fiction.

Even if vaccine choice was offered, it would be illusory. Why? Because under the current circumstances, the decision to vaccinate is usually rendered through frightening misinformation. The most common refrain we hear is: "Do you want to go back to the days of polio? Well, we're not sure that those days ever really ended. Read on to find out why. The only way to make a decision that is not clouded by fear is to expose the reality behind the illusion.

From our research (and for some of us, from personal experience) many more that "one in a million" lives have been ruined by vaccines. We don't want any more people to be hurt needlessly. This is what motivates us.

Based on the feedback we received from our readers, we've made every effort to cover topics of greatest interest and importance. We have also kept some of the original articles and stories, as they are still as relevant as ever. We encourage you to explore both sides, and make an educated decision.

[At least some of the misinformation [on measles] comes from this 40-page pamphlet produced by the anti-vaccination group Parents Educating and Advocating for Children's Health (PEACH), whose members are largely anonymous. Although rabbinical leaders in New York have urged vaccinations as consistent with Jewish law, one article in the pamphlet, published under a pseudonym, challenges the morality of vaccines.

Another questions how much money doctors make by administering what the author describes as unnecessary care.

PEACH also runs a hotline, with archived conference calls, and 140 lectures by speakers it describes as doctors who do not believe in vaccinations.

Rabbi David Niderman, executive director and president of the United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburg, expressed anger about the pamphlets spreading fear by putting out false information linking immunizations to autism and illnesses (excerpt from https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/new-york-city-vaccination-order-shines-spotlight-on-insular-jewish-community/2019/04/11/fd59b098-5bc3-11e9-a00e-050dc7b82693_story.html). - Mod.LK]

[3] Orthodox Jewish community

https://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/general/1713167/statement-from-agudath-israel-of-america-on-the-measles-outbreak-and-infectious-hatred.html


Agudath Israel of America is deeply concerned about the recent outbreak of measles and the threat it poses to communities around the country.

For that reason, countless rabbinical figures and leaders, including leading rabbis in the Agudath Israel movement and doctors serving these communities, have repeatedly encouraged vaccination in the strongest possible terms. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of children enrolled in Jewish schools are vaccinated. Governmental records indicate that the measles vaccination rates in yeshivas in Williamsburg, Borough Park and across New York State are high, with yeshiva averages statewide exceeding 96%. Similarly high rates were obtained in areas around the country with large Jewish populations. While vaccination rates in certain schools and for preschoolers may be lower, vaccination is the clear societal norm in Orthodox Jewish communities.

Agudath Israel views with equal alarm something else that has spread along with this disease: infectious hatred. Our public discourse is debased when individuals and media outlets point the finger of blame for the spread of measles squarely - and sometimes viciously - at the "ultra-Orthodox" community. Social media comments have been particularly appalling in this regard. This is a time to come together and collaborate to meet a challenge. There is no excuse to use a public health issue - an outbreak we are suffering from - as a platform from which to spew poisonous anti-Semitic rhetoric. The motive behind this hatred becomes readily apparent in light of statistics evidencing that acute Orthodox Jewish outbreak areas have vaccination rates rivaling those of many other municipalities.

There may be reasons why, despite the high percentages of immunization, Orthodox Jewish communities are more susceptible to an outbreak of measles. Epidemiologists have chronicled how international travel by Orthodox Jews to outbreak areas, closely interrelated Orthodox social networks, and high numbers of Orthodox children at ages most susceptible to a highly contagious disease are key factors in the spread of diseases of this kind. These are all reasons it is imperative to build on the Orthodox Jewish community's already high vaccination rate, not to spread a contagion of hate.

The eradication of these dual scourges - disease and hate - demands our immediate response.

[The more the rabbinical figures and religious leaders stress the safety and efficacy of the MMR vaccine, the better the chance of reaching the ears of the parents who have been informed only with misinformation. It is difficult to understand how there would be as many cases as there have been if 96% of the children really were vaccinated. If that were the case, then international travel to outbreak areas would not be able to spread upon return even if a single individual became infected. Similarly, closely related networks of people would be safe from an occasional introduction of measles if 96% of the members of the network were vaccinated. But high numbers of children too young to be vaccinated would be a vulnerable population susceptible to infection. The older children, however, would be protected if vaccinated. - Mod.LK]

[4] Anti-vax activities
Date: Thu 11 Apr 2019
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/04/online-anti-vax-efforts-prove-daunting-public-health-challenge


Earlier this week New York City Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot, MD, blamed a small group of anti-vaccine advocates for their role in an ongoing measles outbreak among the city's Orthodox Jewish population. "This outbreak is being fueled by a small group of anti-vaxxers in these neighborhoods. They have been spreading dangerous misinformation based on fake science," Barbot said.

Barbot's statement is one of the strongest examples of the new reality facing public health officials in 2019: They must track and control infectious disease outbreaks, while simultaneously fighting public misinformation about vaccine use and safety.

Earlier this year [2019], Facebook announced it would no longer allow the promotion of anti-vaccine messages in ads, but will not [take] remove anti-vaccine posts. Pinterest has also recently taken steps to limit misinformation, including disabling the phrase "anti-vaccine" from its search tool.

But Peter Hotez, MD, PhD, a Houston pediatrician and an expert in vaccinology, worries these efforts may prove to be too little, too late. "The anti-vaccine movement is like its own media empire," said Hotez. "It's like Fox News or MSNBC; they have co-opted Amazon's website, and they are amplified on Facebook and YouTube. And the defense of vaccines is left to a handful of academics. It's not adequate."

Individual stories, coordinated attacks
---------------------------------------

Niko Yiannakoulias PhD, a professor at McMaster University, recently co-authored a study published in Vaccine that looked at vaccine videos posted on YouTube in 2018. His team found 1 million YouTube videos after searching "flu shot" in May 2018 and more than 45 000 for "measles vaccine." Yiannakoulias and his colleagues analyzed the top 150 videos for "flu shot" or "measles vaccine" for pro-, neutral, or anti-immunization messaging.

They found that anti-vaccine videos got more "likes" and views that pro-vaccine videos, and only 17% of "flu shot" videos were pro-vaccine. What surprised Yiannakoulias the most, however, were the creators of the videos.

"We found people uploading personal stories about how their child cried after getting vaccines," Yiannakoulias told CIDRAP News. "It was user-generated videos, very grassroots, and the messaging would maybe contain some specific language, like 'mercury,' and then go into an anecdote."

While YouTube may be fueled by individuals, some efforts are more systematic. Beth Hoffman, a researcher at the University of Pittsburgh, recently published work (also in Vaccine) examining how anti-vaccine groups attacked physicians online, via Yelp reviews and Facebook posts in what she called a coordinated attack.

Hoffman and colleagues looked at the anti-vaccine posts that followed after KidsPlus Pediatrics, a Pittsburgh-based physician group posted a video on its Facebook page promoting the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine as an anti-cancer tool. "We saw 800 people comment on these posts in 8 days, with people from 36 states and eight countries," Hoffman said. "That speaks to an integrated group of people."

And the anti-vaccine people, in this case, relied on a veneer of scientific language to legitimize their attacks on the physician group. "A lot of posts linked to YouTube videos and articles by Andrew Wakefield, or physicians or nurses who are against vaccination," Hoffman said. Wakefield, the famously discredited British physician, was the first to incorrectly link vaccines to autism in 1998.

Hoffman said her group is now looking at how the information gleaned from the Facebook attack could be used to help craft counter anti-vaccine messages online.

Health departments try to engage
--------------------------------
Greg Nordlund, the social media coordinator at the Washington State Department of Health, tracked online messaging, including anti-vaccine statements, during the state's recent measles outbreak.

"Anytime we put up a vaccine post, we get a lot of pushback from people online," Nordlund said. And while he did say that the outbreak, which included a state of emergency declaration, did inspire more pro-vaccine posts than normal, the barrage of negative comments is constant. "We try to answer questions in comments, and be judicious about when and what we do, but we're fighting a battle against a wave of negative comments at any time," said Nordlund.

For Hotez, the anti-vaccine sentiment seen online will likely only get worse before it gets better. That's largely because, as Nordlund also acknowledged, a pro-vaccine online presence is dwarfed by anti-vaccine messages. "We have not had a pro-vaccine entity system in place in well over a decade," said Hotez, who recently authored a book about his adult daughter called Vaccines Did Not Cause Rachel's Autism. "If parents go looking for pro-vaccine information online, what do they have? The CDC website?"

Much of the measles conversation has been centered around children, childhood vaccination and the virus spreading among kids in schools and elsewhere. But children are not the only ones susceptible to the potentially deadly virus. In fact, adults are actually some of the most at-risk people for complications associated with the measles virus.

Unless a person has had the measles before and it was confirmed with a lab test, or they have been vaccinated against the virus, they are at risk of getting the measles. "Adults can definitely get measles. Their cases are similar to children and being an adult is actually a risk factor for severe illness and complications," Dr. Melissa Stockwell, with Columbia University Medical Center, told Newsweek. In 2017 there were 110 000 deaths related to measles worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises that children under 5 years old and adults over the age of 20 years are at higher risk for measles complications. One of the most common complications adults come down with is pneumonia or an infection in the airways or lungs. Some adults are more vulnerable than others and some might have more serious complications. Other complications include encephalitis -- a swelling of the brain -- diarrhea and vomiting.

"Adults older than 20 years, pregnant women and those with compromised immune systems are at high risk for severe illness and complications from measles," said Stockwell. Women who get the measles while pregnant could suffer a miscarriage or stillbirth, or enter labor prematurely, according to the National Health Service.

[6] New York (Rockland county): opinion
Date: Fri 12 Apr 2019, 3:15 AM ET
Source: USA Today [abridged, edited]
https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2019/04/12/new-york-measles-outbreak-cdc-rockland-county-column/3434163002/


In New York state, Rockland County's count for measles cases rose this week to 180 since the outbreak began here last October [2018]. Just this month [April 2019], we have seen 23 new cases, 85% of these cases have been in children. In the 1st week of April, a person with measles was brought to our local hospital ER and promptly exposed 42 people to the highly contagious disease. Those exposures included 11 children and 4 pregnant women.

I have grave concerns about the trajectory of the measles outbreak here in Rockland County. In an effort to stem the tide of cases, we declared a state of emergency in late March [2019], which barred unvaccinated persons under the age of 18 from public places for 30 days, or until they are vaccinated.

Unfortunately, the anti-vax movement, which relies on inaccurate science and dangerous misinformation, inserted itself into something that only health and government officials should be allowed to determine. Their legal challenge resulted in a questionable court opinion temporarily blocking our state of emergency order. We disagree with the judge's opinion that this measles crisis does not rise to the level of an emergency and are appealing the decision.

I refuse to sit idly by while those in Rockland are put at risk as my highest responsibility is for the well-being of the people. We are moving forward with other steps to ensure the public health of Rockland is strong, vital and free of preventable diseases.

A national outbreak is a national outrage
-----------------------------------------
In our continuing efforts to limit and prevent exposures to others, our county health department is ensuring compliance with our health commissioner's orders issued in December [2018], which require any school with a less than 95% vaccination rate to keep unvaccinated students home. Schools must continue to comply or face fines. We are also moving ahead with new strategies to help protect the public health and further limit exposures.

Our health department is working to finalize criteria to identify individuals who will be issued new orders that will further prevent the spread of measles by requiring unvaccinated people who have been exposed to measles to remain home and away from public places.

This is a slight pivot from what our state of emergency declaration was achieving, but it is a step we can take now while we wait on our legal appeal. This measles outbreak is an imminent threat to public health and we will continue to take every action within our power to combat it, just as other communities throughout the nation are doing.

Florida, Indiana, Massachusetts and Nevada reported their 1st cases of measles this year [2019], bringing the total number of states reporting cases to 19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that, nationally, there were 387 cases of measles between [1 Jan and 28 Mar 2019] alone, exceeding the total number of cases for all of 2018.

The CDC also reports that the total number of measles cases nationwide this year [2019]"is the 2nd-greatest number of cases reported in the U.S. since measles was eliminated in 2000."

Containing a preventable disease
--------------------------------
We need the help of the public at large to be successful in our efforts to limit and prevent exposure to others. As we recently experienced here in Rockland County at our local hospital, just one person with measles can spread the disease to others exponentially.

- It is vital that all cases of the measles be immediately reported to health care providers and/or health departments so that exposures can be limited and post-exposure prophylaxis can be offered.

- We urge anyone who has symptoms or thinks they may have been exposed to call ahead before seeking medical care so doctor's offices, hospitals and urgent care centers can take appropriate actions to limit possible exposure to others.

- When those with measles or those who have been exposed to measles are directed to stay home, they must stay home and away from those who could be at risk.

- I cannot emphasize enough the importance of getting vaccinated. It is safe, effective and it is the responsible thing to do. One in 20 children with the measles develops pneumonia, the most common cause of death from measles in children. One in 1000 children develop swelling of the brain, which can cause deafness and intellectual disability. These complications are preventable with the MMR vaccine.

Let us all hope that reasonable minds prevail during this crisis, and that all of our communities are able to recognize the need to place the health and well-being of our neighbors above all else, before these outbreaks become epidemic.

[7] Washington D.C. (Georgetown): rabbi supports vaccination, quoting Torah
Date: Thu 11 Apr 2019, 8:14 PM EDT

https://protect2.fireeye.com/url?k=88017122-d425706b-88038817-0cc47aa8d394-a24e5046fbf4e882&u=https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/georgetown-rabbi-takes-a-stand-against-measles-outbreak/65-05d08a57-f62d-40cc-9f8e-fc73df75a15b


Kesher Israel, an Orthodox Jewish synagogue in Georgetown, is saying it will not allow any child or adult who has not had their measles vaccine to join any services at Kesher. "Getting vaccinated according to recommended guidelines is not only vital for the health of both our community and the public-at-large, but it is also our halachic obligation," wrote Rabbi Hyim Shafner.

The synagogue's move comes as New York City's Orthodox community grapples with close to 300 cases of measles. At least 2 religious leaders in Brooklyn have cautioned their congregants against getting the vaccine, leading Mayor Bill de Blasio to declare a public health emergency requiring everyone in Williamsburg to get the vaccine within 48 hours.

"It's so against what we believe as Jews, it's just -- it's a little heartbreaking," said Shafner, adding the Torah dictates, "you're not allowed to endanger yourself. You're not allowed to endanger others."

The 1st confirmed case of measles in Maryland was reported last [Tue 9 Apr 2019] in Pikesville, a popular Orthodox Jewish area.

Shafner told WUSA9 he and his congregants are worried unvaccinated people traveling to D.C. over the upcoming Passover holiday could be bringing measles with them. "It really began because somebody in the congregation came to us and said 'Hey, this is happening in other places, I have a little kid, I'm worried about my own children," said Shafner.

The synagogue will not be able to check who has gotten their vaccines, but the rabbi trusts congregants will respect his wishes. "We can't really check, so what we can do is put up signs," he said, adding he felt an obligation to get involved. "As a rabbi, I want to make a statement, because I feel something is being done against Judaism, telling people not to vaccinate is against Jewish law," he said.

[8] Connecticut
Date: Fri 12 Apr 2019
Source: CT Mirror [abridged, edited]
https://ctmirror.org/2019/04/12/third-case-of-measles-this-year-confirmed-in-connecticut/


Health officials have confirmed a 3rd case of the measles in Connecticut this year [2019].

An adult from New Haven County was exposed to the disease last month [March 2019] during a visit to Brooklyn, N.Y., the state Department of Public Health said on [Fri 12 Apr 2019]. It is not linked to the 2 previously verified cases that were reported in January [2019].

The person has been isolated, health officials said. "We are monitoring and investigating this case very closely, including working with our local health departments to follow up with any individuals that may have been exposed to measles," State Health Commissioner Renée D. Coleman-Mitchell said.

Connecticut reported 3 cases of measles to the CDC in 2018. The state's vaccination rate has traditionally been high. In the 2017-18 school year, the most recent data available, more than 96% of the state's kindergarteners were vaccinated against polio, diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella, Hepatitis A and B and varicella. Between 95% and 98.5% of 7th graders were immunized against those conditions and meningococcal disease.

Most of the recent measles outbreaks in the United States were the result of a traveler bringing the disease home with them from overseas. The virus then spread through the unvaccinated people in the travelers' communities.

Officials in Rockland County, New York, declared a state of emergency last month [March 2019] in connection with a measles outbreak. As of [Thu 11 Apr 2019], the county reported 180 confirmed cases of the disease. The outbreak has been largely concentrated in ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities in Rockland, where vaccination rates tend to be lower and anti-vaccination literature has circulated, officials have said.

The resurgence of measles in the United States is spurring a backlash against vaccine critics, from congressional hearings investigating the spread of vaccine misinformation to state measures that would make it harder for parents to opt out of immunizing their children.

Coleman-Mitchell said that due to Connecticut's high vaccination rate, the state is "at low risk" for a widespread measles outbreak.

[9] New York: measles outbreak spreads to more counties

The measles outbreak in New York has spread to 2 more counties. Health officials say cases have been confirmed in Westchester and Sullivan Counties following the spike in infections in Rockland County and the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn.

Measles has been confirmed in 8 children, ranging in age from 6 months to 14 years old, all of whom live in northern Westchester and were not vaccinated, CBS New York reports; 6 of the infected children are siblings. Two additional cases were confirmed in Sullivan County.

On [Tue 9 Apr 2019], New York City declared a public health emergency over the measles outbreak and ordered mandatory vaccinations in one Brooklyn neighborhood for people who may have been exposed to the virus.

Westchester borders Rockland County, where measles cases have been concentrated among members of the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community. The 1st cases in Westchester occurred in other secluded Hasidic Jewish enclaves, Nitra and nearby Kasho, CBS New York reports. Officials said the children all appear to have been exposed to measles in Rockland County or Brooklyn.

"I'm very upset that people have their own opinion and not immunizing the children and putting risk on other children who can get sick," said Nitra Community Administrator Herschel Reich. "It's very serious."

Officials say none of the sick children attend public schools or go to child care programs. The Westchester County Department of Health is working with the families and health care providers to identify locations where the children may have exposed others.

Even among New York's Hasidic Jews, members of the ultra-Orthodox Satmar sect are known for their strict religious and cultural traditions. They speak mainly Yiddish. They shun the secular world. They are skeptical, if not suspicious, of anyone from outside their insular community in Brooklyn's Williamsburg neighborhood.

On [Wed 10 Apr 2019], the city sent 15 to 20 "disease detectives" into the community, some with Yiddish interpreters, a day after Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) vowed to quash the outbreak with USD1000 fines and misdemeanor charges for anyone in certain areas who refuses to be immunized.

The workers, wearing blue Health Department jackets, conducted interviews in the homes of people who may have been exposed to the dangerous, highly contagious measles virus and checked the immunization records of all those they may have had contact with. Others pored over records for the same information at a federally funded health clinic in the heart of the community. There are 1800 unvaccinated yeshiva, or Orthodox Jewish, students with religious exemptions in the 4 Zip codes targeted by the city, spokeswoman Marcy Miranda said.

"It is highly unusual for the city to deploy health workers in this manner," Miranda said. The last time health-care workers undertook the time-consuming work of contact tracing was during the Zika outbreak in 2016.

New York City has had 285 cases, virtually all of them in Brooklyn, since the outbreak began in October [2018]. Of those, 229 were reported this year [2019], accounting for nearly half of the 465 cases that have been reported nationwide in 2019. Now, measles has been found in more than a third of U.S. states -- up and down both coasts, and across the plains, the Midwest and the South -- with most of the illnesses in children.

In Williamsburg, the attention is becoming a sore spot for some in a community that would rather be left alone.

David Oberlander, principal of a yeshiva where measles was found earlier in the outbreak, criticized De Blasio's office and what he called "very, very inaccurate stories" about his community; "3% are anti-vaccination," he said; "97% of our students and family are vaccinated."

Israel Friedman, a property manager who said his many siblings and 2 of his 3 children have been immunized, agreed, saying: "We're talking about a very small minority who aren't vaccinated." His infant is still too young to be vaccinated, he said.

Health authorities say they are seeing a very different reality. When 90% of a population is vaccinated against a particular threat, "herd immunity" protects all but a few. "It certainly can't be 98 or 99%," said John Marshall, chairman of emergency medicine at Maimonides Medical Center, the main hospital in the area. "If there were 90% of people immunized in the community, it wouldn't be spreading."

In fact, Marshall and other medical officials called the 285 known cases a severe undercount of the real measles toll in Williamsburg and its vicinity. A total of 7 children and 2 adults have been hospitalized at Maimonides since the outbreak began, including 1 adult and 1 child in intensive care.

The child, a 13-month old, had breathing difficulties as a result of the measles, said Rabia Agha, director of pediatric disease. Still, the girl's parents refused to have her vaccinated against other diseases after she recovered, despite the entreaties of the medical staff.

Another time, Marshall said he threatened to call police on parents who were refusing to send a feverish child to a hospital in an ambulance for fear the authorities would learn all their children were unvaccinated.

"The ones who are so vehemently anti-vaccination, I don't know how to convince them," said Edward Chapnick, director of Maimonides's infectious-disease division.

Public health experts warn that the city's use of emergency power, while reasonable, could further alienate the ultra-Orthodox who already isolate themselves from greater society. "When an outbreak is concentrated in a specific group, there is a risk of outsiders stigmatizing that group," said Saad Omer, an infectious-disease expert at Emory University who researches public health and immunization. "This risk is exacerbated when a public health emergency is declared."

As reports of measles cases climb across the nation, San Mateo County Health officials are advising residents to exercise caution if they identify any symptoms of the viral disease.

Measles in 2019 has infected one county resident and one international traveler coming through San Francisco International Airport, explained Dr. Catherine Sallenave, infectious diseases staff physician with San Mateo County Health.

The county logged one confirmed measles case in 2018 and none in 2016 and 2017, Sallenave said in an email, adding 4 measles cases were recorded in both 2014 and 2015.

According to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, outbreaks of measles are currently ongoing in 2019 in jurisdictions in Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Washington and, in California, Santa Cruz and Butte counties. The number of measles cases reported in the United States as of [4 Apr 2019] is 465, already surpassing the 372 cases logged in 2018, according to the CDC's most recent data.

A total of 17 measles cases have been reported in California in 2019 so far, with 3 in both Santa Clara and Placer counties, according to the California Department of Public Health's most recent data. As of [7 Mar 2019], 21 confirmed measles cases were reported in the state in 2018, according to the department.

Though most patients recover from measles without complications, the disease can severely affect non-immune pregnant women and those with compromised immune systems, such as those with human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, or patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer, said Sallenave. She noted pregnant women who contract measles may be at risk for miscarriage or going into premature labor, and added measles has also been tied to a complication called subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a progressive, disabling and fatal disorder with symptoms that typically appear 4 to 8 years after measles infection.

[12] USA overview
Date: Tue 9 Apr 2019

https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/09/us/measles-outbreak.html


There were more new cases of measles reported last week in the United States than in any other week of 2019, new government data shows, with the outbreak spreading to 4 states that recorded their 1st cases of the virus for the year [2019].

In the 1st week of April, the country added 78 new measles cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with Florida, Indiana, Massachusetts and Nevada confirming their 1st patients. Two weeks ago, the country added 73 new cases, which was the most for the year until last week.

The dozens of new infections take the count to 465 confirmed cases this year [2019], the 2nd-greatest number of reported cases in a year since 2000, when measles was declared eliminated in the United States.

At the current rate, the country would surpass by midyear the number of measles cases in 2014, when an outbreak among unvaccinated Amish communities in Ohio helped drive the total to 667 reported cases, the high mark for this century.

A total of 15 other states have also reported cases this year: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Texas and Washington.

Daniel Salmon, director of the institute for vaccine safety at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, cautioned against reading too much into the weekly data. "Maybe it's getting worse," he said, but he emphasized that measles vaccination coverage is strong at the national and state levels -- more than 90% of children are immunized, according to C.D.C. tracking -- which has kept the outbreaks mostly isolated to geographic and social pockets.

[13] Prague: measles on the rise
Date: Tue 9 Apr 2019, 2:07 PM
Source: Prague.TV [abridged, edited]
https://protect2.fireeye.com/url?k=9d5c1ebe-c17912dd-9d5ee78b-0cc47aa88e08-2115eb5d0f63fdcd&u=https://prague.tv/en/s72/Directory/c202-Beauty-Health-Wellness/n17471-Measles-on-the-rise-in-Prague


Some 139 cases of measles have been registered in Prague since the beginning of the year [2019], which is an increase over last year [2018], which saw 103 cases by this time. Since the beginning of the measles outbreak at the start of 2018, there have been 242 confirmed cases in Prague. Anti-epidemic measures were applied against 2037 people and 902 faced quarantine or medical supervision.

According to Prague hygienists, people who have been vaccinated with only one dose of the vaccine should have their immunity tested via a blood sample. About one-third of people tested lack sufficient antibodies. This mainly concerns people born from 1967 to the first half of the 1970s, according to the Prague Hygiene Station.

Furthermore, hygienists recommend a test for antibodies in persons whose loved ones have reduced immunity. "For example, if the person is undergoing cancer treatment. People with immunodeficiency are more prone to all infectious diseases, including measles. Therefore, the environment of the oncological patient should be protected, and the patient cannot usually be vaccinated," Prague Hygiene Station spokesman Zbynek Boublik said.

New parents should also be tested for immunity. Small children are vaccinated in the Czech Republic only from the 13th month of age, while measles can have a serious effect in newborns and very young children. If the test shows a low level of antibodies in the parents, it is possible to vaccinate them to protect the children.

If a general practitioner issues an antibody test application, the insurance company pays for the examination. Otherwise, the test must be paid for by the candidate himself, but are only around CZK 350 [approx. 15 USD], depending on the lab.

The disease had been considered under control in the developed world but has
had a resurgence due to a drop in vaccination rates.

http://www.ejinsight.com/20190409-five-more-measles-cases-including-pregnant-woman-confirmed/


Five more people, including a 28-year-old pregnant woman, were confirmed to have contracted measles in Hong Kong, taking the number of cases this year [2019] to 61, the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) under the Department of Health said.

The 28-year-old patient is the 1st pregnant woman to have been infected by the measles virus this year [2019], the CHP said. As many as 28, or nearly half of the cases, were associated with the measles outbreak at the Hong Kong International Airport. All of the 5 new cases were in stable condition, the Hong Kong Economic Journal reported.

The pregnant woman had a good health record prior to contracting measles and no travel history during the incubation or communicable period. She attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Pok Oi Hospital on [5 Apr 2019] and was transferred to Tuen Mun Hospital for admission and treatment on the same day. She had received 2 doses of measles vaccination in the past.

Investigation also revealed that the pregnant patient had received regular antenatal check-ups at the Madam Yung Fung Shee Maternal and Child Health Center in Yuen Long during the communicable period.

The health department has stepped up infection control measures in the center and reminded staff members and visitors to take proper infection control measures like wearing masks and washing hands. Relevant epidemiological investigations and contact tracing are also continuing.

Dr. Kun Ka-yan, a specialist in obstetrics and gynecology, pointed out that it is most dangerous for a pregnant woman who contracts measles 2 or 3 weeks before delivery as she would not have enough time to develop sufficient antibodies to protect her baby.

As such, the baby might end up being infected by the measles virus and born with some serious complications, such as encephalitis, which could impede the baby's future physical and mental development or even prove life-threatening, Kun said. The chances of miscarriage will increase if the infection happens before 12 weeks. If the infection happens after 12 weeks of pregnancy, the chance of a premature birth will go up, Kun said.

Three of the 5 new cases worked at the airport, including a 25-year-old woman and 2 men aged 23 and 29, all of whom had received 2 doses of measles vaccination in the past. The 5th case involved a 41-year-old man with good past health. His measles vaccination history was unknown but he had traveled to the Philippines during the incubation and communicable period.

The Central Committee on Infectious Disease and Emergency Responses of the Hospital Authority (HA), along with CHP representatives, held a meeting on [Mon 8 Apr 2019] to discuss the latest situation of measles infection.

After the meeting, the HA said the current staff measles vaccination program will cover staff members of Accident and Emergency Departments as well as General Out-patient Clinic triage stations from [Wed 10 Apr 2019].

According to Dr. Vivien Chuang Wai-man, HA chief manager for infection, emergency and contingency, infectious disease experts agreed at the meeting that vaccinating these healthcare workers would help reduce their risk of infection and further infecting other patients seeking consultation. The 1st phase of healthcare staff measles vaccination program began last week, with more than 1300 staff members working in high-risk departments and with inadequate immunity having been vaccinated as of [Mon 8 Apr 2019] night.

UNICEF-WHO Philippines: Measles Outbreak, Situation Report 9, 14 April 2019
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview
Current measles outbreak started late 2017 in Mindanao. In 2018, 20 827 cases were reported with 199 deaths. Outbreak and supplementary immunization activities in 2018 were ineffective in addressing the outbreak as the immunization activity was met with increased vaccine hesitancy due to the Dengue vaccine controversy. Weak routine immunization leading to a decrease in overall immunization coverage in recent years resulted in significant immunity gaps among younger children.

The Philippines Department of Health (DoH) declared measles outbreaks in 5 Regions (Region NCR, III, IV-A, VI, VII) on [7 Feb 2019], whereas cases are being reported from all 17 Regions. DoH issued guidelines for nation-wide measles vaccination accompanied by Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) and Vitamin A distribution until end of March [2019], prioritizing unvaccinated children between 6 and 59 months; schoolchildren from kindergarten to grade 6; and adults who voluntarily wish to be vaccinated against measles.

Current Situation
Between [1 Jan and 5 Apr 2019], 28 362 measles cases including 389 deaths were officially reported through the routine surveillance system from the DOH, with a Case Fatality rate of 1.37% (see Table 1).

With a median age of 3 years old, 53% of measles cases are under 5 years of age. A total of 53% of measles cases are male.

With a median age of 1 year old, 84% of all deaths are children under the age of 5, and 61% of measles deaths are male. Most deaths are reported from Region III, IV-A, VIII and NCR.

As of 5 Apr 2019, 90% of cases have no documented vaccination status. DoH data shows that 3% of cases had been previously vaccinated with 2 doses of measles vaccine. The vaccination status of the remainder of cases is unknown.

New Zealand
-----------
In New Zealand, health officials have confirmed 72 measles cases since the beginning of the year [2019], including 23 that required hospitalization.

More than half the cases were reported from Canterbury, while nearly 2 out of 10 cases were from Waikato.

The majority of cases have occurred in children, adolescents and young adults aged under 29 years.

Australia
---------
Australian officials have reported 83 measles cases through [5 Apr 2019]. This is compared to 103 and 81 cases in all of 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Nationally, vaccination rates (receiving 2 doses of the vaccine) for children under 2 years of age are below the 95% threshold (93.5%).

In addition, Health Minister Greg Hunt warned that due to changing vaccine schedules for Australians born between 1966 and 1994, some people may have received only 1 dose of vaccine, instead of 2, making them more susceptible to infection.

Australians unaware they need a 2nd vaccination prompt calls for better outreach programs. [...] it was unlikely there had been an increase in the number of Australians questioning the vaccine's efficacy and who opposed the vaccination, infectious disease experts say. Rather, some Australians are unaware that they are no longer immune to the disease, while others haven't got around to getting their children vaccinated due to logistical reasons or language barriers.
