Czech chief health inspector Michael Vit has told CTK [Czech News
Agency] that he is considering revaccination of adolescents against
mumps in view of the recent epidemic of the disease in a north
Bohemian region [Stredocesky or Usti nad Labem] where 996 cases were
reported in the 1st 4 months of this year [2011].

Czech children are vaccinated against mumps after reaching the age of
15 months and revaccinated at the age of 3. Before deciding on
revaccination of adolescents, Vit wants to have an immunological
survey carried out next year [2012] to show whether adolescents remain
immune against mumps or need a further vaccination, strengthening
their immunity.

"We defeated the epidemic in north Bohemia, but we still want to
complete the immunologic survey next year [2012] to decide on whether
additional vaccination is needed in some areas to protect the group of
children aged 14, 15 and more," Vit said. A discussion is underway on
what other infections the survey should map [immunity of] apart from
mumps.

In the Usti region, north Bohemia, the epidemic afflicted mainly
people in the 14 to 19 age category. The Health Ministry, in
cooperation with the regional health inspection, reacted by having 11
832 children in the region vaccinated for free.

>From January 2011 to the 14th week of 2011, a total of 516 cases of
mumps were reported in 4 of the region's 7 districts, which is 61.7
patients per 100 000 inhabitants. The cases in the Usti region made up
76 percent of mumps cases that were registered nationwide in the given
period.

[Mumps outbreaks in recent years have given rise to questions about
the effectiveness of the mumps vaccine. A recent study in Israel
examined epidemiological data from a recent mumps outbreak there and
observed that the epidemiological and laboratory evidence suggested
that many previously vaccinated adolescents and young adults were now
susceptible to mumps because their vaccine-based immunity has waned.
They concluded that booster vaccination programmes for those at high
risk of infection during mumps outbreaks -- particularly those in
congregate living environments -- merit priority consideration (Anis
E, Grotto I, Moerman L, Warshavsky B, Slater PE, Lev B. Mumps outbreak
in Israel's highly vaccinated society: are two doses enough? Infect.
2011 Apr 20:1-8,
http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=8259199).

Shelley L. Deeks, et al. (An assessment of mumps vaccine effectiveness
by dose during an outbreak in Canada (CMAJ. 2011 June 14; 183(9):
1014-1020, http://www.cmaj.ca/content/183/9/1014) reported that the
vaccine effectiveness of one dose of the MMR vaccine ranged from
49.2-81.6 percent, whereas vaccine effectiveness of 2 doses ranged
from 66.3-88.0 percent. If vaccine effectiveness of 85 percent for 2
doses of the vaccine is assumed, vaccine coverage of 88.2 percent and
98.0 percent would be needed to interrupt community transmission of
mumps. They concluded that outbreaks occurring in Ontario and
elsewhere serve as a warning against complacency over vaccination
programmes. (See also: ProMED-mail: Mumps - Canada (04): (ON) 20110809.2418).

It is likely that an analysis of the situation in northern Bohemia
would reinforce these conclusions. A map of the Czech Republic showing
