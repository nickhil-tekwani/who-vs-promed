An outbreak of pertussis at a school in Leicestershire
---------------------------------------------
An outbreak of pertussis has occurred at a primary school in the Vale of
Belvoir in north Leicestershire, on the boundaries with Nottinghamshire and
Lincolnshire. The outbreak was recognised on 23 May 2002, the first case
having developed symptoms on 25 Mar 2002.
The Head Teacher of the school had first reported concerns that children at
the school had whooping cough at the beginning of May, and contacted the
Leicestershire Health Protection Team again on 15 May 2002. When contacted,
local general practitioners (GPs) reported that they did not think that
they were seeing children with pertussis. [Certainly, the diagnosis of
pertussis may be difficult, but earlier diagnosis may have minimized the
outbreak - Mod.LL] A further report on 22 May 2002 that nearly half of the
pupils were coughing prompted a visit to the school by the Health
Protection Team on 23 May 2002. At the visit, children were observed to
have paroxysmal cough typical of whooping cough.
The school is in a small village. It has 86 full-time pupils aged between 5
and 10 years, 21 part-time pupils aged under 5 years, and 16 teaching and
other staff members. Children aged 5 and under are taught in a mobile
classroom. Other children are taught in 2 classrooms in the main school
building: children in years one and 2 (aged between 5 and 7) in one
classroom and years 3, 4, and 5 (aged between 7 and 10) in the other classroom.
After consultation with the PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre
and the Respiratory and Systemic Infection Laboratory at CPHL, initial
action was agreed that included: (1) information about the outbreak and
pertussis to be sent to parents of all children at the school; (2)
information about the outbreak and whooping cough to be sent to all local
GP practices with advice on the immediate management of suspected cases;
(3) a symptom questionnaire to be administered to all children and staff in
the school; (4) rapid confirmation of disease to be attempted by obtaining
pernasal swabs for _Bordetella pertussis_ PCR from those with early coryzal
symptoms, and blood for serological evidence of recent _B. pertussis_ in
those with a 2-week history of typical paroxysmal cough (>100 EU/mL of _B.
pertussis_ IgG is suggestive of recent infection, in the absence of recent
immunization).
A 7-day course of erythromycin was initially offered to all children and
staff at the school because so many appeared to have early coryzal
symptoms. Chemoprophylaxis with erythromycin was offered to vulnerable
household contacts of cases. NHS Direct was briefed to enable them to
handle enquiries from parents, and pediatricians in local NHS Trusts were
informed of the outbreak. An outbreak control team first met on 27 May 2002.
Information from the questionnaires suggested a continuing outbreak. The
first child became unwell before the Easter holiday break and returned to
school on 8 Apr 2002. A household contact of this child became unwell a
week later followed by several more within the next fortnight. The epidemic
curve demonstrated the continuing progression of the outbreak. There was a
total of 23 confirmed and probable cases, including 7 members of staff.
Within 24 hours of receipt of the samples, 6 cases were microbiologically
confirmed by RSIL-CPHL, using culture, PCR, or serology, and 17 were
probable cases (cough for more than 2 weeks) including 7 members of staff.
Pupils and staff throughout the school were affected, but most cases were
aged 5 to 7 years. Childhood vaccine uptake in the area is very high, and
only 1 child was identified who had not received a primary course of
pertussis vaccine. Few children were young enough to have benefited from
the addition of acellular pertussis to the preschool booster in November 2001.
The further measures to investigate and control the outbreak were agreed
are as follows, taking into account factors such as the known widespread
intolerance to erythromycin: (1) Active case finding by providing
information and raising awareness through primary care, local schools, and
NHS Direct. (2) Active treatment of suspected cases, including anyone with
coryzal symptoms and direct epidemiological links to the outbreak. (3)
Sentinel microbiological surveillance in selected practices in the Vale of
Belvoir, with pernasal swabs for _B. pertussis_ culture from patients
presenting with coryzal symptoms and serological testing for pertussis
toxin IgG from patients with cough of more than 2 weeks duration. (4)
Strain typing of _B. pertussis_ isolates obtained to determine whether the
strain was similar to other circulating strains. (5) Given the likely
intolerance to erythromycin among those offered treatment, azithromycin for
6 days (dosage as per British National Formulary) should be the treatment
of choice in order to ensure compliance. (6) All children in the school
would be offered a DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis) booster
injection, as would other vulnerable children in the area ie those under
the age of 4 months who would not be fully immunized, and other children
with immune deficiencies or lung conditions such as cystic fibrosis for
whom whooping cough would potentially be a life-threatening illness.
The outbreak control team met again on 7 Jun 2002 to review the management
of the outbreak. It appeared that the outbreak at the school had been
brought under control. Active case finding and sentinel surveillance had
identified a small number of additional cases in the local community, but
no evidence consistent with a widespread community outbreak. It was agreed
that no further control measures were necessary. A further questionnaire
will be administered to parents of all children at the school to document
the true extent of the outbreak. The 80 children who had been given an
additional DTaP booster were asked to complete symptom diaries that will be
analyzed to determine the extent of adverse reactions that can sometimes
occur when children receive more DT than in the routine schedule (there is
no available monovalent pertussis vaccine).
The strain of _B. pertussis_ has been identified by RSIL-CPHL as serotype
1,3 and appears similar to other strains circulating in England and Wales.

[The description of the circumstances of this pertussis outbreak
underscores how difficult control of this infection can be in a school even
with what seems to be adherence to immunization schedules and how important
early suspicion and diagnosis remain. In total, 16 of 86 students were
thought to have been infected (18 percent of the student body - if no
sibling non-student cases were included) and 7 of 16 staff (44 percent).
The active surveillance, aggressive diagnosis methodologies, and
appropriate therapeutic interventions brought the epidemic to an end - Mod.LL]
[The epidemic curve of this outbreak is available on the PHLS website link
given above. The delayed identification of this outbreak is noteworthy as
the date of onset of the index case was 25 Mar 2002 while the outbreak was
officially identified on 23 May 2002, 8 weeks later. In an earlier comment
the vaccine efficacy was estimated to be at 74 percent. According to the
information given above, the apparent vaccine efficacy in this outbreak was
between 82 and 84 percent (86 full-time students and 12 part-time
students), well within the range of expected vaccine efficacy for 3 doses
of the whole cell vaccine, albeit the true efficacy will not be known as
other control measures were implemented. The occurrence of cases in staff
members is consistent with current concerns on the contribution of adults
to pertussis circulation. - Mod.MPP]
