INFECTION CONTROL - ENGLAND
===========================
Date: Sat, 1 Jun 1996 06:49:19 +0100
From: s.barrett@ic.ac.uk (Stephen P Barrett [Medicine])

I am a member of an infection control team in an English teaching hospital.
I can access internet because I am employed by the university which has
internet available on the local college network. I expect the same is
probably true for some other teaching hospitals. Most English infection
control teams work in non-university hospitals and would have access to
internet only if some member with a personal interest has made deliberate
efforts to gain access - probably by subscribing on a home computer. The
national health service would probably regard the whole thing as a frivolity
and not wish to sponsor it.
Our antibiotic resistance problems are probably fairly typical: MRSA, MRSA
and yet more MRSA. A minor and intermittent problem with VRE and occasional
multiresistant gram-negatives that don't fit any particular pattern. Also
_Clostridium difficile_ from time to time with some clustering.
