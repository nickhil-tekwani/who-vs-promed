The Ebola outbreak that emerged in Guinea in mid-February 2021 was declared over today [19 Jun 2021]. It was the 1st time the disease resurfaced in the country since the deadly outbreak in West Africa that ended in 2016.

Guinean health authorities declared the outbreak on 14 Feb 2021 after 3 cases were detected in Gouecke, a rural community in the southern N'zerekore prefecture, the same region where the 2014-2016 outbreak 1st emerged before spreading into neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone and beyond.

A total of 16 confirmed and 7 probable cases were reported in Guinea's latest outbreak, in which 11 patients survived and 12 lives were lost. Shortly after the infections were detected, national health authorities, with support from the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners, mounted a swift response, tapping into the expertise gained in fighting recent outbreaks both in Guinea and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

"I commend the affected communities, the government and people of Guinea, health workers, partners, and everyone else whose dedicated efforts made it possible to contain this Ebola outbreak," said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. "Based on the lessons learned from the 2014-16 outbreak and through rapid, coordinated response efforts, community engagement, effective public health measures, and the equitable use of vaccines, Guinea managed to control the outbreak and prevent its spread beyond its borders. Our work in Guinea continues, including supporting survivors to access post-illness care."

WHO helped ship around 24 000 Ebola vaccine doses and supported the vaccination of nearly 11 000 people at high risk, including over 2800 frontline workers. More than 100 WHO experts were on the ground coordinating key aspects of the response such as infection prevention and control, disease surveillance, testing, vaccination, and treatment using new drugs. Collaboration with communities was also enhanced to raise awareness about the virus and ensure their involvement and ownership of the efforts to curb the disease.

"Although this Ebola outbreak flared up in the same area as the West Africa one, which killed 11 000 people, thanks to new innovations and lessons learned, Guinea managed to contain the virus in 4 months," said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa. "We are getting faster, better, and smarter at fighting Ebola. But while this outbreak is over, we must stay alert for a possible resurgence and ensure the expertise in Ebola expands to other health threats such as COVID-19."

WHO continues to support Guinea in its efforts to remain vigilant, maintain surveillance, and build capacity to respond quickly to a possible resurgence of the virus. An Ebola laboratory, treatment infrastructure, logistics capacity, and infection prevention measures have been reinforced to better respond to the disease as well as other health emergencies.

While the latest Ebola outbreak was limited to Guinea, to prevent cross-border infections, WHO supported 6 of the country's neighbours to ramp up preparedness measures, including stepping up surveillance and screening at border crossings and within high-risk communities, as well as enhancing coordination between governments and the respective health services.

Support to Ebola survivors is also crucial. Genome sequencing found that the virus behind Guinea's just-ended outbreak was similar to that identified in the 2014-2016 outbreak. Though more studies are needed to fully understand how the 2 outbreaks may be linked, Guinean health authorities reactivated a surveillance programme for survivors to provide long-term monitoring and after-care support.

In support of the government's efforts to curb the outbreak, WHO worked with other United Nations agencies and partners such as the African Development Bank, the Alliance for International Medical Action, African Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the International Organization for Migration, the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, Terre des Hommes, the United Nations Central Emergency Response Fund, the United Nations Children's Fund, the United States Agency for International Development, the World Bank, and the World Food Programme.

[Note that the DR Congo outbreak was declared over on Mon 3 May 2021. In that outbreak, the virus infected 12 people in the eastern province of North Kivu and killed 6 of them. See ProMED posting "Ebola update (34): Congo DR (NK) outbreak end, research 20210504.8342814."

Africa is now free of reported Ebola activity in humans, but because spillover from bats and persisting virus in male survivors can ignite a new outbreak, intensive surveillance must continue, as well as maintenance of existing public health infrastructure. This also will contribute to control of spread of SARS-CoV-2. - Mod.LK
