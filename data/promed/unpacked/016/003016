The Canadian Food Inspection Agency says it will not reinstate an emergency truck washing protocol at the Manitoba [province, Canada]/USA border in light of a new case of a virulent hog virus on a Manitoba hog farm.

"The CFIA will not be re-establishing the temporary protocol," an agency spokesperson said Friday [27 May 2016] in an email. "Trucks entering Manitoba will continue to be subject to the Health of Animals Regulations, which are in effect for all ports of entry across Canada."

"The available scientific information shows that the PED [porcine epidemic diarrhea] virus will not survive a hot water wash with detergent, even if recycled water is used," the email reads.

The CFIA's response comes after a single case of porcine epidemic diarrhea was found on a pig farm in Manitoba, Thursday [26 May 2016] -- just weeks after the agency ended emergency truck washing standards to the dismay of the province's hog industry.

The Manitoba Pork Council said Friday the province's chief veterinarian has confirmed a single, positive case of PEDv in a sow barn on a medium sized farrowing operation in southeastern Manitoba. The case was confirmed 26 May 2016. It is the 1st case to be found in Manitoba since 21 Jan 2015.

"Control measures were implemented immediately, and a plan has been developed for restricted site access, barn clean-up and animal care," Manitoba Pork said. Farms within 5 kilometres of the barn have been notified of the outbreak, the council said, noting the infected farm is located in a region with lots of pigs.

Sampling is being done at farms nearby, Manitoba Pork General Manager Andrew Dickson said in an interview, Friday. At this time, no other farms are showing signs of the disease. The producer and veterinarians are still deciding the fate of the farm's animals.

Millions of piglets in Canada and the United States have died from the virulent PEDv virus since the 1st case was discovered in the U.S. in 2013. The highly contagious disease causes severe vomiting and diarrhea in pigs and can kill nearly entire all of a barns porcine inhabitants in a short period of time.

The PEDv case comes just weeks after the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) halted an emergency truck washing protocol 1 May 2016 that forced American swine transport trucks to be disinfected in Canada.

Farmers argue those standards will put hogs and piglets at risk because many American truck washing stations recycle the water used -- a practice that could help the virus spread.

Manitoba Pork recently called the CFIA's decision to reverse the truck washing rules "a crisis."

Asked about the truck washing, Dickson said he could not tie a direct link to the case and the CFIA's decision to revert back to its old truck washing requirements.

A source for the outbreak, which Dickson said was found in an "odd part of the barn" where staff don't frequently enter, has not been determined yet, he added.

Still, Dickson said, farmers, veterinarians and scientists will continue to urge CFIA to reinstate the truck washing rules. "We didn't have a case from 21 Jan 2015 until 1 May 2016 when the protocol was in place," he noted.

The policy reversal, he said, "just doesn't make sense."

Representatives from the national pork industry, Dickson said, will be seeking a meeting with CFIA on the issue given the latest case, adding he expects Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay's office will also become involved.

In an interview with iPolitics 2 May 2016, MacAulay said the policy was an "emergency measure."

"Following a scientific review, the CFIA determined that no emergency measures were need[ed] ... It's a health issue -- if I was to overrule the CFIA and they indicate to me that it's for the protection of the industry, I can't do that," he said.

"CFIA and their officials, and I don't believe that they would mislead me, they tell me there's no problem with the water and that it's a health issue to bring the trucks in not washed."

Reached in Winnipeg, the minister's Director of Communications Guy Gallant said MacAulay was aware of the case in Manitoba and was monitoring the situation.

[The article states the PED case was found in an "'odd part of the barn' where staff don't frequently enter." This may mean it is not a normal area for pigs, or may not have been cleaned recently, or perhaps something like it was being renovated. The statement seems rather odd. Why would staff not check an entire barn? Why leave out a section unless there are no animals there? So, was the "area" not cleaned and the virus just waiting for a pig to come along? This needs some investigating and clarifying.

So who pays for staff at the truck washing station? If CFIA is not doing it, can it be staffed privately?

We look forward to the outcome of this meeting.

Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is coronaviral diarrhea affecting pigs of all ages and clinically resembling transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) in several respects.

Etiology and Epidemiology
The PED virus is not related to any other member of the _Coronaviridae_. Pigs are the only known host. Antibodies to the virus have not been found in wild pigs or in other animal species. Infections have been seen in most European countries and in China. In April 2013, disease due to PEDV was diagnosed in the USA for the 1st time. Large epidemics occurred in Europe in 1969; no antibodies have been found in sera collected before 1969. Since then, the virus has become widespread and endemic in several European countries, and acute outbreaks have become rare. On large breeding farms, the virus persists in consecutive litters of pigs after weaning and after they lose their immunity from antibody in the milk. On these farms, the virus may be associated with weaning diarrhea. In Belgium, the virus is most frequently associated with diarrhea in feeder pigs, which develops shortly after they are gathered from different breeding farms and assembled in large fattening units. The virus was demonstrated in fecal material in 80 percent of these groups. Outbreaks in the USA caused 60 percent-100 percent mortality in suckling pigs and mild to severe diarrhea in all pigs of all ages; they were initially believed to be outbreaks of TGE. Spread of the virus mainly occurs directly through infected pigs and indirectly through virus-contaminated fomites and via transport trucks.

Pathogenesis
The pathogenesis and immune mechanisms are similar to those reported for TGE. Oral infection results in viral replication in the epithelial cells of the small intestinal villi. Cells on colonic villi also become infected. No other tissue tropisms have been shown. Virus is excreted in the feces.

Clinical Findings
Diarrhea is the only direct virus-induced clinical sign seen. An acute outbreak on a susceptible breeding farm resembles a TGE outbreak and is characterized by watery diarrhea in pigs of all ages. However, as compared with TGE, the incubation period is longer (3-4 days), not all the litters of suckling pigs may become sick, and mortality in neonatal pigs is lower (average 50 percent). Also, the disease within the farm spreads more slowly. In all outbreaks, signs are most consistently seen in feeders, finishers, and adults, which appear to be most susceptible because outbreaks often start in these age groups. Older pigs are more lethargic and depressed with PED than with TGE. Sick pigs appear to have colic.

Acute outbreaks in susceptible finishing pigs are characterized by watery diarrhea, but a markedly increased number of acute deaths may be seen, particularly in pigs infected toward the end of the finishing period and in stress-sensitive breeds. Death may even occur during the incubation period.

Lesions: Macroscopic lesions are confined to the small intestine, with villous shortening as the main characteristic. These lesions closely resemble those seen with TGE. No lesions have been described in the colon. A consistent finding is acute necrosis of back muscle.

Diagnosis
Clinical differentiation from TGE is difficult. TGE in its typical epidemic form causes a rapidly spreading diarrhea in animals of all ages, with high mortality in neonates. With PED, the diarrhea spreads at a slower rate, and although diarrhea is seen in most of the litters, some litters may remain healthy even in the absence of immunity. Morbidity is 100 percent in older pigs, and they are severely sick. Acute deaths in adults and finishing pigs due to muscle necrosis and that occurs during an outbreak of diarrhea are typical of PED and are not seen with any other infectious diarrhea.

Laboratory diagnosis in neonates is made by PCR and/or direct immunofluorescence on cryostat sections of small intestine or colon. ELISA to detect viral antigens in feces or intestinal contents is more useful for older pigs. Antibodies can be detected in paired serum samples through ELISA-blocking.

Control
No specific treatment is available. Measures taken during an outbreak are of a general nature. Pigs with diarrhea should have free access to water, and finishing pigs should have feed withheld for 1-2 days.

PED virus can be eliminated from herds without total depopulation by: maximizing immunity with planned infection of the sow herd; an "all-in/all-out" management of farrowing, nursery, and grower rooms; and good sanitation.

Because PED virus is easily spread during an epidemic by people, animals, and fomites, special care should be taken to prevent spread to unexposed groups of pigs and to neighboring herds. The use of vaccines for prevention has not been well documented.
