The anthrax outbreak here which hit 41 victims was traced to
gastrointestinal infection due to the consumption of meat from
carabaos, which died of unknown causes.

On 29 May 2010, the National Epidemiology and Surveillance Center --
which conducted an investigation in Villaviciosa after the anthrax
outbreak -- confirmed that 41 people in the town had been infected by
the deadly _Bacillus anthracis_ or anthrax. Local health officials
said the situation is now under control after antibiotics were
immediately distributed to the residents. None of the victims --
mostly men -- died, but all of them had skin lesions. Laboratory
tests confirmed that the lesions were positive for anthrax.

In a study <http://www.psmid.org.ph/vol30/vol30num3topic1.pdf>, Raul
V. Estura, M.D., a Fellow of the University of the Philippines,
Philippine General Hospital on Taft Avenue in Manila, said that 3
types of anthrax infection occur in humans: inhalational, cutaneous
and gastrointestinal. The Abra outbreak was determined to have been
gastrointestinal in nature. The Center for Health Development in
Cordillera discovered that the 41 victims all ate "meat from
butchered carabaos that died of unknown causes." Hide samples from
the dead carabaos were sent to the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI)
for analysis.

In his study, Dr. Estura said that "gastrointestinal anthrax results
from contamination of infected meat products. The manifestation is
difficult to differentiate from other diseases unless a high index of
suspicion is present and the organism is isolated from blood and
stool specimens."

"It is the local health service including the infectious disease
specialists that stay in the front lines," said the study. "If the
local health service is not aware of the potential threats or has low
index of suspicion for diseases caused by likely bio-terrorist agents
such as anthrax or plague, even the best-laid plans won't play out as
expected."

The conditions of the 41 victims are being monitored, and Abra
officials are now awaiting results from BAI regarding the hide
analysis of the dead carabaos.

On 28 Feb 2010, 2 persons died, and at least 400 were infected with
anthrax after eating "double-dead" carabao meat in Cagayan province.

[It has now been confirmed that the 41 people who ate the infected
meat from 2 Caraboas (a type of water buffalo) in Abra, Philippines
had gastrointestinal anthrax and not just the cutaneous type of the
disease, as reported in the previous story. It is completely possible
that they had cutaneous lesions as well from cutting up and handling
the infected meat. Despite propaganda, people are still eating the
meat from animals which died suddenly and may be infected with
anthrax. - Corr.SB]

[There is a confusion still, but what is important is that the
original tentative diagnosis has been confirmed as "anthrax." It is
unusual to see both cutaneous and gastro-enteric affected
individuals, if only because the 1st carries a 10 percent lethality
risk if untreated and the latter a 30-40 percent risk of dying, and
it is frequently a quick, early death before treatment can be
initiated. They would not have survived long enough to develop
cutaneous lesions. Cutaneous lesions from handling the meat are very
probable, and it is repeated that all 41 had cutaneous lesions. But
anthrax has been confirmed. - Mod.MHJ]
