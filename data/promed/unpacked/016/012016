The Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA) announced Friday [10 Oct 2014] directing [that] a beef shipment from Poland [be] taken off the market due to the potential risk of the bacterial disease [due to] _Bacillus anthracis_. The shipment consisted of Polish and Slovak carcass parts.

On [Wed 8 Oct 2014], it became known that 2 of the carcasses from a Slovak livestock tested positive for anthrax.

The NVWA details the situation (translated): The cattle were slaughtered on [19 Sep 2014] in Poland. [No abnormalities were detected during] inspections before and after slaughter. On 27 Sep 2014, more than a week after the slaughter of anthrax [anthrax was diagnosed] on the holding of origin of 2 Slovak cattle. The incubation period in the cow is 3 to 7 days. It is unlikely that an ox is already contagious during the incubation period, but that cannot be completely ruled out. The incubation period in humans is 1 to 7 days. Cattle are significantly more susceptible to anthrax than humans. Research indicates that a person must ingest [contaminated meat] to become ill.

Food safety officials say it is not clear whether the potentially tainted beef found its way to supermarkets; however, they say the risk to consumers is considered very small.

[But the earlier report (see ProMED-mail 20141010.2851912) said, "consignment of beef to be withdrawn from the market because it may be contaminated with anthrax. " Note "may" not "is". According to the OIE report (see ProMED-mail 20141001.2822945) the original outbreak on the Slovak farm started on or about 27 Sep 2014, and confirmed on 29 Sep 2014. 2 cattle from the Slovak farm were sold and slaughtered on 19 Sep 2014 in Poland when nothing abnormal was noted; anthrax was diagnosed on this Slovak farm a week later. The Dutch authorities were demonstrating an abundance of caution. - Mod.MHJ]
