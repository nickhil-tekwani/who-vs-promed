Human Rhodesian sleeping sickness in Uganda points to infected livestock
movements
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The northwards spread of human Rhodesian sleeping sickness in Uganda is
likely due to the movement of infected livestock, according to new findings
from an interdisciplinary research group including members from the Centre
for Infectious Diseases, University of Edinburgh; the Ministry of Health,
Uganda; and the Universities of Oxford and Southampton.

The current study, published 15 Dec 2009 in the open-access journal PLoS
Neglected Tropical Diseases, provides evidence that the spatial
distribution of the disease in a recently affected area is constrained by
the location of livestock markets, indicating the role of cattle (the
predominant reservoir of disease) in its spread. A complex interaction of
environmental and climatic factors was also found to affect distribution of
the disease.

Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT, or sleeping sickness) is a fatal
disease transmitted by the tsetse fly in sub-Saharan Africa. Endemic in
some regions, it spreads across 36 countries. It is estimated that around
60 000 people are currently infected.

There are 2 forms of the disease (an acute "Rhodesian" form, which the
research focuses on, and a chronic "Gambian" form), but fears are growing
that they may overlap in Uganda, which could render current diagnosis and
treatment protocols ineffective.

Previous work implicated livestock movements in the spread of this disease.
Regulations were therefore reinforced that required the treatment of all
cattle from endemic areas prior to sale at livestock markets. The primary
aim of the new research was to investigate potential reasons for this
subsequent spread of the disease. The researchers conducted both a one-step
logistic regression analysis of HAT prevalence and a 2-step logistic
regression method, which enabled separate analysis of both occurrence and
prevalence of the disease. Both the occurrence and prevalence were
negatively correlated with distance to the closest livestock market in all
models.

To prevent the overlap of the 2 disease forms, a large-scale intervention,
Stamp Out Sleeping Sickness (<http://www.stampoutsleepingsickness.org>),
has been applied. This public-private partnership has treated more than 250
000 animals to clean the disease from the overlap zone. However, continued
movements of untreated animals into the cleaned zones present an ongoing
risk. The authors conclude that "the stringent implementation of
regulations requiring the treatment of cattle prior to sale at livestock
markets should be a priority for the Ugandan Government."

Future research by the group will aim to extend this study by assessing the
risk of further Rhodesian HAT spread and the potential for overlap with the
Gambian form of the disease.

We agree with the comment in the report, that the finding has wide
implications for trypanosomiasis control, showing that focus should be on
movement of livestock.
