The health protection agency, Public Health England (PHE), has issued urgent guidelines for health professionals. Close to 1050 new cases of scarlet fever have been confirmed between 31 Mar and 6 Apr [2014]. Since September 2013, there have been a total of 7198 new cases.

The guidance focuses on the public health management of scarlet fever outbreaks in schools, nurseries, and other care settings.

Recommendations from the PHE in these locations: good hand hygiene; covering mouth and nose with hand or tissue when coughing or sneezing; wash hands after/dispose of tissue; educating parents/guardians, staff and GPs; 24 hours of antibiotics and absence from environment where fever can spread.

Scarlet fever is mainly a childhood disease and is most common between the ages of 2 and 8 years. It used to be more dangerous than it is now but there are complications, particularly in those who remain untreated.

Group A streptococcal infections: 3rd update on seasonal activity, 2013/14
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Surveillance of scarlet fever notifications continues to indicate high levels of notified cases in England, with recent weekly totals remaining higher than any among existing weekly records dating back to 1982 [1,2,3]. GP sentinel (syndromic) surveillance continues to report high levels of GP consultations for pharyngitis/scarlet fever in all age groups compared to the same period last year [4]. Routine laboratory reports and isolate referrals do not show any widespread elevation of invasive group A streptococcal (iGAS) disease incidence.

Monitoring systems to assess the impact of the current scarlet fever upsurge and the frequency of complications are being established. Microbiological investigation of scarlet fever isolates is underway. Interim guidelines to assist local health protection staff in managing outbreaks of scarlet fever in schools and nurseries have been issued [5].

Due to rare but potentially severe complications associated with group A streptococcal (GAS) infections, continued vigilance is recommended.

Scarlet fever. A total of 7198 scarlet fever cases have been notified so far this season (week 37 2013 to week 15 2014 [9 Sep 2013-13 Apr 2014] (figure 1), with week 14 of 2014 [31 Mar-6 Apr 2014] seeing the highest number of scarlet fever notifications received in one week (1049) in England.

Scarlet fever notifications remain high across England, with rates of infection being higher than the same point last season in all parts of the country (see table). The highest cumulative rates of notification this season were seen in the East Midlands (30.5), Avon, Gloucestershire, and Wiltshire (23.5), Thames Valley (19.8), North East (17.8), and Cumbria and Lancashire (15.6).

88 per cent of notifications received this season have been in children aged less than 10 years, the median age remaining at 4 years (range less than 1 year to 90 years). The proportion of notifications seen in males and females remains similar with 49 per cent being in males overall.

Currently the iGAS [invasive GAS] strain type diversity remains similar to what is normally seen; _emm_ 1 remains the most common type identified so far in 2014 (27 per cent). The proportion of referred isolates which have been identified as _emm_ 3 type is slightly high this season compared to last season (22 per cent compared with 14 per cent), and given the increased severity of disease associated with _emm_ 3 strains this warrants increased monitoring.

No changes have been identified in iGAS [invasive GAS] infection antimicrobial susceptibility patterns from routine laboratory reporting made this season (weeks 37 2013 to 15 2014), with 6 per cent of those tested being non-susceptible to erythromycin, 10 per cent tetracycline and 3 per cent clindamycin, all similar to previous years [6]. There have been no reports of penicillin resistance in iGAS isolates in England to date.

Investigations are underway to assess the possible reasons behind the exceptional increase in scarlet fever. Microbiological investigation will be conducted through a sentinel sampling scheme being undertaken in collaboration with PHE Regional Microbiology laboratories and selected NHS laboratories. As a means to assist HPTs [health protection teams] in managing outbreaks of scarlet fever in schools and nurseries, interim guidelines have been drafted and disseminated which provide advice on recommended public health actions [5].

Clinicians, microbiologists and HPTs should continue to be mindful of potential increases in invasive disease and maintain a high index of suspicion in relevant patients as early recognition and prompt initiation of specific and supportive therapy for patients with iGAS infection can be life-saving. Invasive disease isolates and those from suspected clusters or outbreaks should be submitted to the Respiratory and Vaccine Preventable Bacteria Reference Unit at Public Health England, 61 Colindale Avenue, London NW9 5HT.

Relevant guidelines are available on the PHE health protection website, as follows:
- Infection control in schools and other childcare settings, including recommended exclusion periods for scarlet fever, at http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/SchoolsGuidanceOnInfectionControl/
- FAQs on scarlet fever at http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/ScarletFever/

[The outbreak of scarlet fever continues throughout the UK. At the last ProMED post on this outbreak (8 Apr 2014, Streptococcus, group A, scarlet fever - UK (08): (England) update 20140408.2388282), there were total of 5012 new cases since the season began in September 2013, compared to an average of 1420 cases reported for the same period in the previous 10 years. Now, since the season began in September 2013 (week 37 2013 to week 15 of 2014; 31 Mar 2013-13 Apr 2014]) there are 7198. We are told by PHE that results of the ongoing microbiological investigation of Group A streptococcal strains causing this scarlet fever outbreak will be forthcoming.

Microbial strain typing is a useful adjunct to clinical epidemiology. Phenotypic typing systems examine expressed characteristics, such as the serologic M protein typing system developed by Dr Rebecca Lancefield in 1928; genotypic systems examine chromosomal or plasmid DNA. Group A streptococci (_Streptococcus pyogenes_) strains are now commonly classified on the basis of sequence variation in the 5' end of the _emm_ gene. The 5' ends of _emm_ gene are highly heterogeneous and encode for the serotype specificity used for the M-typing system. For most M serotypes, there is a one-for-one relationship with a unique _emm_ sequence type (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/5/2/99-0209_article.htm).

Other molecular techniques to further characterize outbreak strains to see whether there is commonality among the outbreak strains include pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of chromosomal DNA fragments, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), and detection of exotoxin-encoding genes (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670197901948, http://www.jstor.org/pss/30128192, http://iai.asm.org/cgi/content/short/69/4/2416, and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20687911).
