On 30 Oct 2010, PulseNet, the national molecular subtyping network for foodborne disease surveillance, detected a multistate cluster of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium infections with a particular pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern and other genetic characteristics, referred to here as strain X. In December 2010, the New Mexico Department of Health identified 3 ill persons infected with strain X. One was a student and the 2 others were children of students in microbiology courses held at 2 different community college campuses. CDC collaborated with public health officials in several states to investigate this multistate cluster of _S._ Typhimurium infections associated with exposure to clinical and teaching microbiology laboratories. Investigators used DNA analysis of _Salmonella_ bacteria obtained through diagnostic testing to identify cases of illness that might be related.

Between 20 Aug 2010 and 29 Jun 2011, a total of 109 individuals infected with strain X of _S._ Typhimurium were reported from 38 states: AK (2), AL (4), AZ (4), CA (3), CO (1), FL (1), GA (6), IA (1), ID (2), IL (4), IN (2), KS (4), KY (4), MA (4), MD (3), MI (3), MN (9), MO (2), NC (1), ND (1), NE (2), NH (1), NJ (3), NM (3), NV (1), NY (4), OH (3), OK (1), OR (1), PA (9), SC (2), SD (1), TN (2), TX (1), UT (4), WA (5), WI (4), and WY (1). Among persons with available information, illness onset dates range from 20 Aug 2010 to 14 Jun 2011. Infected individuals ranged in age from less than 1 year to 91 years old, and the median age was 21 years. 61 percent of patients were female. 12 percent of patients were hospitalized. 1 death was reported.

Investigation
-------------
In an epidemiologic study conducted during February and March 2011, 32 ill persons answered questions about exposures during the days before becoming ill. Investigators compared their responses with those of 64 persons of similar age previously reported to state health departments with other illnesses (controls). Preliminary analysis of this study suggested that exposure to clinical and teaching microbiology laboratories was a possible source of illness. Illnesses were identified among students in microbiology teaching laboratories and employees in clinical microbiology laboratories. Ill persons (60 percent) were significantly more likely than control persons (2 percent) to report exposure to a microbiology laboratory in the week before illness began. Additionally, multiple ill persons reported working specifically with salmonellae bacteria in microbiology laboratories. The New Mexico Department of Health found that the strain isolated from patients was indistinguishable by PFGE pattern from a commercially available _S._ Typhimurium strain used in laboratory settings. This commercially available strain was known to be present in several teaching or clinical laboratories associated with ill students or employees infected with the outbreak strain. These data suggest this strain was the source of some of these illnesses. Additionally, several children who live in households with a person who worked or studied in a microbiology laboratory became ill with the outbreak strain.

The investigation then focused on potential risk factors in microbiology laboratories that work with infectious agents like strain X of _S._ Typhimurium. CDC collaborated with state and local health departments, the American Society for Microbiology, and the Association of Public Health Laboratories to conduct a survey to identify areas where improvements in biosafety and laboratory safety training can be made to prevent future illnesses. The survey was conducted with 2 groups in May 2011: staff from laboratories that had been associated with illness, and staff from laboratories that were not associated with illness.

Laboratory practices and settings appear to be largely similar across both groups, but several differences were found. Staff working at laboratories that were associated with illness were less likely to have knowledge of biosafety training materials. In comparison, staff working in laboratories that were not associated with illness were more likely to train students and staff on the signs and symptoms of infection with salmonellosis when conducting safety training. Similar safety policies were in place across the different laboratories. However, some policies appeared to be more difficult to monitor and enforce, such as not allowing the use of handheld devices (for example, cell phones or music players) at the laboratory work space.

Findings of this survey indicate that teaching and clinical microbiology laboratory instructors should enhance training of students and staff on biosafety measures necessary in the laboratory.
