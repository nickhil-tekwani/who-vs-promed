Brazil Finds Foot-and-Mouth Disease in Para State (Update1)
------------------------------------------------------
June 17 (Bloomberg) -- Brazil, the world's second-largest beef producer,
found cattle infected with foot-and-mouth disease in the Northern state of
Para, the first outbreak in three years of a disease that has limited the
country's meat exports.
Three infected head of cattle were found the municipality of Monte Alegre,
the Agriculture Ministry's press office in Brasilia said. Brazil last
reported a foot-and-mouth infection in August 2001 in Maranhao state, the
ministry said.
Brazil's past foot-and-mouth outbreaks may have kept the country from
filling a gap in beef exports to Japan, Korea and other Asian nations after
mad cow disease was found in the U.S. and Canada last year. Brazil was
expected to become the world's largest beef exporter, after U.S. and
Canadian beef sales were closed to most Asian markets because of mad cow
concerns, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in April.
Brazil can't export to U.S. because of foot-and-mouth restrictions, said
Eric Nichols, an official at the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service. The current ban has been under review for the last two years with
no timetable for a decision, he said.
The bulk of Brazil's exports of fresh and frozen beef go to nations in the
European Union, where foot-and-mouth standards are lower than in the U.S.,
which doesn't allow Brazilian chilled or frozen exports.
Brazil's beef production has risen 25 percent in the past five years and is
expected to reach a record 7.7 million tons in 2004 because improved
genetics, better management, and higher profitability, the department said.
Foot-and-mouth disease is an acute, highly contagious degenerative viral
disease of cattle characterized by fever and the eruption of vesicles
around the mouth and hooves. It is usually not fatal. Mad cow disease, or
bovine spongiform encephalopathy, is an infectious degenerative brain
disease occurring in cattle.
