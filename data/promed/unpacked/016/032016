INFECTION CONTROL - SOUTH AFRICA
================================
Date: Thu, 27 Jun 1996 13:46:50 SAT-2
From: "Oliver, S, Steve, Dr" <STEVE@medmicro.uct.ac.za>

I am a medical microbiologist at Groote Schuur Hospital, Cape Town, South
Africa.
I was forwarded a note which came from ProMED-mail. If it is a way of being
informed of current medical issues, I am interested and would like to know
more. My particular interests are Infectious Diseases and Infection Control.
