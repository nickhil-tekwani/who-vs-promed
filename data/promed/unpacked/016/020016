Foot-and-mouth infections confirmed in 2 more Miyazaki cities
-------------------------------------------------------------
In the wake of suspected cases of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in the
Miyazaki beef cattle center of Miyakonojo, infections were also
confirmed on 10 Jun 2010 in the cities of Miyazaki and Hyuga.

Both cities have started slaughtering and burying livestock, as
officials struggle to control the highly contagious disease.

In Miyazaki, the disease was confirmed at a farm with 1325 pigs, while
it hit a farm with 349 head of cattle in Hyuga.

The Miyazaki Municipal Government has decided to close the Ikime no
Mori sports park, located near the area where the infections broke
out. Annually, some 260 000 people visit the park, which has tennis
courts and a stadium used for training by baseball teams including the
Fukuoka Softbank Hawks [a baseball team].

"It's near the area where the disease occurred, and the measure was
taken to control the spread of infections. The baseball field will
probably not be available for the prefectural high school baseball
tournament," a municipal government representative said.

In the city of Hyuga, 100 workers and supporters including 13
veterinarians were dispatched to handle the disease. Officials said
they hoped to finish all related work on 11 Jun 2010.

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare and the Miyazaki Prefectural
Government have made efforts to contain the disease following
outbreaks in central Miyazaki Prefecture, introducing restrictions on
movement of cattle and pigs.

Livestock within a 10km [6 mi] radius of farms that have been hit by
the disease have been vaccinated to slow the spread of infection
before being slaughtered. In other areas within a 20km [12 mi] radius,
livestock numbers have been reduced through outbound shipments to
create a buffer zone, preventing infections from spreading between
cattle.

Sterilizing points have also been set up at various points along main
roads, where cars are disinfected. Since 4 Jun 2010, when restrictions
were lifted on cattle in Ebino in western Miyazaki Prefecture, new
suspected infections had appeared to be decreasing, and it was
believed that vaccines had been effective in controlling the disease.

It was after this that the suspected case was reported in Miyakonojo.

Masafumi Mukamoto, an associate professor at Osaka Prefecture
University, said people and vehicles may be responsible. "Looking at
the distances involved, it is highly probable that people and vehicles
have carried the virus. After the animals are vaccinated, symptoms of
the disease don't easily show up even if they are infected. When
people come into contact with these cows they can carry the virus
without knowing it."

Hiroomi Akashi, a professor in veterinary virology at the University
of Tokyo also believes that vehicles have aided the spread of the
disease. He said thorough sterilization ['disinfection' may be the
preferable term. - Mod.AS] measures were needed.

"The latest weekly animal hygiene report of the Ministry of
Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries introduces cases in which
sterilizing work has not been properly carried out after vaccinations
have been performed. If that's true, there may be a connection with
the latest infections. There's a need to provide thorough
sterilization once again," he said.

At present there remain about 30 000 head of cattle that are due to be
slaughtered but have not been culled yet. Furthermore, much work
remains in the process of shipping out cattle to create the buffer zone.

[2] news report

Prime minister Naoto Kan said Friday [11 Jun 010] he will visit
Miyazaki Prefecture on Saturday [12 Jun 2010] as part of the
government's efforts to contain the continuing spread of FMD among
livestock in the southwestern Japanese prefecture.

"Regrettably, the situation is severe," Kan said at a meeting of the
government task force to tackle the problem. "It is important to
contain (the disease) in an initial response. We will do everything we
can."

On Friday [11 Jun 2010], the Miyazaki prefectural government said cows
and pigs in the cities of Miyazaki, Hyuga, and Saito tested positive
in genetic tests [PCR -- see OIE report below] for the highly
contagious disease, showing that the infection has spread within the
prefecture and beyond the area where it was initially concentrated.

The prefecture has already started slaughtering about 220 livestock
bred in farms where the cows and pigs were raised, after they were
found the previous day to show suspected symptoms of infection.

At its meeting in Tokyo, the government task force analyzed that the
disease has spread mainly due to lack of places to bury the
slaughtered livestock, leading the local government to keep about 12
000 cows and some 19 000 pigs alive in the hardest-hit town of
Kawaminami after they were vaccinated.

The central government confirmed it will make efforts to hastily cull
livestock after finding places to bury them in order to prevent the
disease from spreading further. [See BBC News picture of 11 Jun 2010,
showing "Workers digging large holes (landfills) to bury slaughtered
cattle and pigs to prevent the spread of foot-and-mouth disease in
Miyakonojo in Miyazaki prefecture, Japan", at
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/10294452.stm>. - Mod.AS]

It also decided to reinforce disinfection work on roads and national
highways in the region amid the increasing risk of the disease
spreading to neighboring prefectures such as Kagoshima.

The Kagoshima prefectural government plans to block roads connecting
disease-hit Miyakonojo in Miyazaki Prefecture with 3 cities in
Kagoshima Prefecture, including Soo, one of Japan's largest livestock
industry centers, as early as Friday [11 Jun 2010] afternoon,
according to local officials.

MAFF [Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries] Minister
Masahiko Yamada told reporters after the task force meeting that
burying the slaughtered livestock in cities of Hyuga, Miyazaki and
Saito -- where the infection was newly found -- will be completed
within Friday [11 Jun 2010].

Foot-and-mouth disease, Japan: follow-up report no. 8
-----------------------------------------------------
The information in the follow-up report at the URL above, submitted 10
Jun 2010 [thus before the detection of the new cases in Miyakonojo. -
Mod.AS] provides data on 26 new outbreaks, including their respective
numbers of susceptible and sick animals, their species, dates of
vaccination etc; for these details and an interactive map, subscribers
are referred to the full text at the URL above.

The report also includes the following epidemiological comment:
"All the cases had been confirmed by PCR until 1 Jun 2010. However,
since 2 Jun 2010, suspicious animals showing typical clinical signs of
FMD at farms located in the movement control area around
Kawaminami-cho have been officially recognized as FMD cases without
PCR for rapid identification and response. There have been a lot of
outbreaks in the area and it is indicated that the correlation between
typical clinical signs of FMD and PCR results is extremely high.
Suspicious animals without typical clinical signs or kept in other
areas have been confirmed by PCR as before.

Disposal of vaccinated animals started on 5 Jun 2010. The vaccination
has been performed from the rim to the centre of the area since 22 May
2010, giving more prioritiy to pigs than cattle, and was almost
complete by 26 May 2010.

As of 4 Jun 2010, a movement restriction around Ebino city was lifted
because there has been no outbreak in the area since 13 May 2010 and
the absence was demonstrated by active clinical and serological
surveillance targeted at all susceptible domestic animals in the area.
No animals are vaccinated in the area."

[The involvement of Japan's prime minister in the FMD problem,
demonstrated also by his plan to visit tomorrow (12 Jun 2010) the
affected area, is another reminder of the major FMD epizootic in the
UK in 2001. At that time, national elections were postponed and the
PM, Tony Blair, was intensively involved in the control efforts and
the recruitment of the army to assist in the eradication activities.

epizootic, is available at
