The Canadian Animal Health Surveillance System has reported that a horse has tested positive for strangles in New Brunswick.

On 13 Mar 2019, a provincial veterinarian was called out to examine a horse with an abscess. Due to the location of abscess and clinical signs, the veterinarian was suspicious of strangles and swabbed the abscess. Laboratory confirmation on [19 Mar 2019] revealed _Streptococcus equi equi_ (strangles). There are several other horses on the premise.

This latest case of strangles is in the southeastern part of the province and not related to other cases reported. A quarantine of the premise and horses has been made along with visitor restrictions. These animals are being monitored and are being provided with follow-up care.

Strangles is a highly contagious bacterial disease of horses characterized by abscesses in the lymphoid tissue of the upper respiratory tract. The causative organism, _S. equi_ subspecies _equi_, is highly host-adapted and generally produces clinical disease only in horses, donkeys, and mules.

Strangles is an endemic disease in horses and circulates relatively commonly in the horse population. A significant number of affected premises in a relatively confined geographical area is a good reminder to horse owners and veterinarians to practice appropriate biosecurity procedures for horses and equipment coming on and off the farm as well as infection control within the barn.

Transmission occurs via fomites and direct contact with infectious exudates. Sharing of halters and brushes that may contact the fluid from draining abscesses can spread the disease. The source of strangles on any of these premises could have been the entry of a new horse, contact with a carrier somewhere off the farm (e.g., at a show) or on the clothing, hands, or equipment of a visitor (such as a feed supplier, farrier, or veterinarian who had recent contact with an infected horse). Survival of the organism in the environment is dependent on temperature and humidity. Under ideal environmental circumstances, the organism can survive 7-9 weeks outside the host. Paddocks and barn facilities used by infected horses should be regarded as contaminated for about 2 months after resolution of an outbreak.

Carrier animals are important for maintenance of the bacteria between epizootics and initiation of outbreaks on premises previously free of disease. Horse owners need to be aware that clinically recovered animals should have 3 negative nasopharyngeal swabs to be determined "strangles-free."

Recommendations regarding vaccination can be found in the OMAFRA (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs) disease fact sheet. Strangles is a good opportunity to remind your clients the best disease control is disease prevention.

The Rhode Island state veterinarian alerted the Equine Disease Communication Center about a confirmed case of strangles in Newport County.

An event took place on the index property in Newport County, with horses traveling onto and off of the property to other locations.

Horses that were exposed and traveled home, and the horses they contact there, should be monitored for strangles.

Several horses were at this farm the weekend of 23-24 Mar 2019 for an exhibition event, but they returned to their home stables at the conclusion of the event.

Farm management has been notified of this strangles diagnosis, and the Rhode Island state veterinarian has issued an order of quarantine for the index farm.

Owners of horses that were at the farm for the event and returned home are advised to contact their veterinarians to notify them of the potential exposure to _S. equi_ and to self-impose a quarantine where no susceptible animals are to be brought onto or off of the farm, monitor temperatures on all susceptible animals on the farm for 14 days, and report any clinical disease consistent with strangles to their attending veterinarians and state veterinarians where their horses are kept.

At this time, not all of the horses attending the weekend event are known.

[Strangles is a contagious infectious disease of Equidae characterized by abscessation of the lymphoid tissue of the upper respiratory tract. The causative organism, _Streptococcus equi equi_, is highly host-adapted and produces clinical disease only in horses, donkeys, and mules. It is a gram-positive, capsulated B-hemolytic Lancefield group C coccus, which is an obligate parasite and a primary pathogen.

The incubation period of strangles is 3-14 days, and the 1st sign of infection is fever (103-106 deg F [39.4-41.1 deg C]). Within 24-48 hours of the initial fever spike, the horse will exhibit signs typical of strangles, including mucoid to mucopurulent nasal discharge, depression, and submandibular lymphadenopathy. Horses with retropharyngeal lymph node involvement have difficulty swallowing, inspiratory respiratory noise (compression of the dorsal pharyngeal wall), and extended head and neck. Older animals with residual immunity may develop an atypical or catarrhal form of the disease with mucoid nasal discharge, cough, and mild fever. Metastatic strangles ("bastard strangles") is characterized by abscessation in other lymph nodes of the body, particularly the lymph nodes in the abdomen and, less frequently, the thorax. _S. equi_ is the most common cause of brain abscess in horses, albeit rare.

Most horses continue to shed _S. equi_ for around one month after recovery. A total of 3 negative nasopharyngeal swabs at intervals of 4-7 days should be obtained before release from quarantine, and the minimal isolation period should be one month. Prolonged bacterial shedding (as long as 18 months) has been identified in a small number of horses. Guttural pouch empyema is the source of infection in most prolonged carrier states. Bacterial culture of nasopharyngeal swab and/or guttural pouch lavage is used to identify persistent carriers.

Post-exposure immunity is prolonged after natural disease in most horses, and protection is associated with local (nasal mucosa) production of antibody against the antiphagocytic M protein. The clinical attack rate of strangles is reduced by 50% in horses vaccinated with IM products that do not induce mucosal immunity. Local (mucosal) production of antibody requires mucosal antigen stimulation. An intranasal vaccine containing a live attenuated strain of _S. equi equi_ was designed to elicit a mucosal immunologic response. This attenuated strain is not temperature sensitive (inactivated by core body temperature) like the intranasal influenza vaccine. Reported complications include _S. equi equi_ abscesses at subsequent IM injection sites (live bacteria on hands of administrator), submandibular lymphadenopathy, serous nasal discharge, and purpura hemorrhagica.
