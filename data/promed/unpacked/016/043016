The food court illness that sickened 350 people in Kentucky has been identified as norovirus. Citing a Lexington-Fayette County Health Department release, the Lexington Herald-Leader reports that test results from those who had gone to the Fayette Mall food court were consistently positive for the very contagious virus.

Fayette Mall's Chick-fil-A had closed voluntarily 20 Jul 2018, after many employees reported becoming ill. The entire food court closed 23 Jul 2018 for cleaning and sanitization. It reopened the following afternoon, after an inspection by the health department, which visited again Thu 26 Jul 2018.

Most of the people who reported illness became sick a day or 2 after eating at the food court, experiencing fever, vomiting, and diarrhea.

[Norovirus is the leading cause of illness and outbreaks from contaminated food in the United States. About 50 percent of all outbreaks of food-related illness are caused by norovirus. Food can get contaminated with norovirus at any point when it is being grown, shipped, handled, or prepared. Most common outbreak settings include healthcare facilities, restaurants and Catered events, cruise ships, schools and other institutional settings. - Mod.LL
