The CDC says there is an accelerating trend of tickborne diseases in the U.S. as we begin National Lyme Disease Awareness Month.

Scott Moore is a Veterinarian at the Fairmont Veterinary Hospital. He's one of the hundreds of vets in West Virginia and the Northeast that are treating more and more dogs for Lyme disease every year.

"In the last 15 years, we've seen a dramatic rise in Lyme disease cases," Moore said.

According to data from the nonprofit Pets and Parasites, about 1 out of every 20 dogs tested for the disease in West Virginia were positive in 2014. Last year [2018], it was 1 of 10.

Medical professionals aren't quite sure what is causing the increase, which is progressively worse further up the East Coast. But Moore is seeing some trends.

"We're seeing a lot more ticks carrying Lyme disease in our area as opposed to the common wood tick," Moore said.

The CDC also warns that the U.S. isn't fully prepared to control the threat of increasing tick populations.

"Local and state health departments and vector control organizations face increasing demands to respond to ticks and tickborne diseases," a 2018 CDC report said. "Proven and publicly accepted methods are needed to better prevent tick bites and to control ticks and tickborne diseases."

Lyme disease isn't contagious. But it can be deadly if not treated early.

"Sometimes the dogs won't be able to move well. In some cases, it can progress to kidney failure," Moore said. "When Lyme disease hits the kidney, it's almost 100 percent fatal."

He recommends getting good flea and tick prevention for dogs or investing in a flea and tick collar.

The CDC suggests checking yourself for ticks and showering within 2 hours of coming inside including from your own backyard.

"We need to be careful," Moore said. "Check yourself, check your dogs, and use the available preventions. Lyme vaccines are available, and good flea and tick preventions are available."

[Lyme disease is the most commonly reported vector-borne illness in the United States. In 2017, the latest year for which the CDC has published the number of confirmed cases and the incidence of Lyme disease nationally and by state (https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/index.html), a total of 42 743 confirmed and probable cases of Lyme disease were reported to CDC, over 17 percent more than in 2016. The geographic distribution of high incidence areas with Lyme disease appears to be expanding based on data reported to the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. The number of counties with an incidence of 10 or more confirmed cases per 100 000 persons increased from 324 in 2008 to 454 in 2017.

According to the CDC, the highest incidences were in the following regions: New England, Middle Atlantic, and East North Central. The highest 12 states of confirmed and reported cases for 2017 are: Connecticut, 1381; Maine, 1424; New Jersey 3629; New York, excluding New York City, 2906; Pennsylvania, 9250; New Hampshire: 956; Rhode Island, 595; Wisconsin 1794; Minnesota, 1408; Maryland 1194; Virginia 1041, West Virginia 503. Massachusetts is no longer reporting to the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System so figures for 2017 must be obtained from the state office.

It should be noted that although Lyme disease is occasionally reported from other states, because cases are reported by county of residence at the time of diagnosis, the infection was not necessarily acquired in those states or counties, which can be different from the state or county where the patient was infected.

The incidence rates of Lyme disease in West Virginia have been gradually rising since 2006, but in 2015 the incidence rate more than doubled, from 6.1 in 2014 to 13.2 in 2015 and rose again to 16.2 in 2016 (when there were 297 confirmed and 71 probable cases). Most cases were reported from counties located in the northern part of the state, especially counties that border Pennsylvania or Maryland (https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/index.html).

While the above statistics represent the disease in human beings, it is a gauge of the disease in our pets as well. There are a number of products available to prevent ticks from being on your pet for very long. The recommended product for your pet's health condition is best determined with your veterinarian. There is also an available vaccine for dogs. This and all vaccines should be discussed with your veterinarian.

All personnel who work around animals or outside, even in yards, should regularly check themselves for ticks. Small seed ticks can easily crawl up a pant leg and attach somewhere along the route up to the waist band. Seed ticks can be very tiny and may initially look like a small freckle. However, checking for ticks is extremely important. Disease may be transmitted to you in as little as 1-2 hours after the tick attaches.

Your pet's health is vital to your own health, as pets can bring these pests inside to you or they can crawl off of the pet and onto human beings, thus transmitting disease to your pet and to you.

There are a number of different ticks carrying a variety of diseases. Lyme seems to be more prevalent in the Northeast and Eastern seaboard of the United States, but does appear all across the USA. A number of other diseases including ehrlichiosis, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever are among the other diseases capable of affecting you and your pets. Please get appropriate protection for your pets, which includes cats. - Mod.TG
