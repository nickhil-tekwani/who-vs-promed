Administration pushes back rabies-free deadline to 2015
-------------------------------------------------------
The Bali administration officially admitted for the 1st time on Wed
[26 May 2011] that its fight against rabies is not proceeding exactly
as it had foreseen, and disclosed that it would consider pushing back
its deadline for eradicating rabies on the island by 3 years to 2015.

"There is a possibility that the target will be altered from
achieving the rabies-free status in 2012, to 2015," administration
spokesman I Ketut Teneng said.

The change underlines the difficulty the administration is currently
facing in fighting a deadly rabies epidemic that has claimed 148 lives
and spread to all regencies on the island since it broke out in late
2008. The 1st outbreak hit 2 villages in the southern regency of
Badung, spreading to 269 villages at its peak.

The administration said it would eradicate rabies on the island by
2012 in a public campaign in late 2010 in Ungasan, which was where the
1st rabies case had been reported 2 years earlier.

"We are still working very hard to ensure that there will be no new
infections or new rabies cases in animals in 2012," Teneng said.

The idea of pushing back the deadline was based on a realistic
assessment of the epidemic, he said.

"We are still finding new rabies cases in humans and animals. Based
on this fact it would be very difficult to achieve the rabies-free
status in 2012," he added.

Teneng said the administration had the resources to extend its fight
against the disease beyond 2012. "We have drafted the rabies budget up
until 2015. We estimated that for dogs and pets vaccinations alone in
the province would cost Rp 3 billion [USD 348 000] per year," he
added.

In 2010, around 500 dogs were tested positive for rabies. As of the
1st 5 months of 2011 that number was below 100. Of the 269 villages
that originally reported rabies cases, 70 have had no cases in the
last 12 months.

"These are good signs and hopefully the situation will keep getting
better," he said.

On Wednesday [25 May 2011], the administration launched the 2nd phase
of a 3-month mass vaccination drive targeting stray dogs and pets
across the island.

In the 1st month the drive will focus on Bangli, Karangasem, and
Klungkung regencies, before shifting to the island's other regencies
in the 2nd and 3rd months.

"The target of the drive is to inoculate 70 percent of the total
population of dogs and pets on the island," Teneng said.

The drive is co-financed by the government and the provincial
administration.
