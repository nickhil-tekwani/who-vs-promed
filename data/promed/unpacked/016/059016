Explanation on Using Vaccines for the Prevention of Avian Influenza in
China (Ministry of Agriculture, March 2005)
-------------------------------------------
[The following GAIN (Global Agriculture Information Network) report is an
unofficial translation of an update on China's efforts to vaccinate poultry
against avian influenza. This update has been provided to FAS Beijing on 18
Mar 2005 by Dr. Jia Youling, Chief Veterinary Officer and concurrent
Director General of the Veterinary Bureau of the Chinese Ministry of
Agriculture.
The report relates to 3 avian influenza vaccines approved for use by the
Chinese Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) between Dec 2003 and Jan 2005.
According to the MOA, the translated document is from a China country
report presented during a recent FAO/OIE Asia HPAI workshop].
Based on the "National Emergency Plan Against High Pathogenic Avian
Influenza" (HPAI), China has inoculated poultry flocks in areas susceptible
to avian influenza infection. China has also inoculated poultry flocks on
breeding farms, large-sized egg layer farms and in areas with a high
concentration of water bodies. Poultry in certain areas designated "no
enforced inoculation areas" or "no disease infected areas" have not been
inoculated. Other areas apply voluntary inoculation. From February 2004
to January 2005, China has inoculated a total of 2.68 billion birds --
mainly chickens, ducks and geese.
The objective of China's poultry vaccine is to inactivate the highly
pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus H5N2. During 2004, this vaccine
played an important role in HPAI elimination and prevention in China. The
vaccine is only manufactured at the plants designated by the Chinese
Government.
The National Reference Laboratory has also developed 2 new vaccines.
One is a recombinant AI H5N1 virus inactivated vaccine, and the other is a
H5N1 fowl pox live virus vaccine. They are highly efficient, safe and can
be produced cost-effectively. The vaccines passed the Ministry of
Agriculture's new animal drug evaluation and verification process at the
end of 2004.
The recombinant H5N1 virus inactivated vaccine even works better against
the HPAI because its protective period for chickens is longer, and it is
especially effective for waterfowl immunity. The vaccine can efficiently
stop the spread of the HPAI virus. Now, it is widely used for waterfowl
inoculation in water concentrated areas in South China.
In order to strengthen disease control and guarantee inoculation quality,
the Ministry of Agriculture has carried out regular inoculation supervision
and evaluation through sampling serum and pathogen tests among inoculated
poultry flocks. Up to now, we have not isolated any H5N1 virus from our
inoculated poultry flocks. At the same time, some provinces in South China
have adopted a measure of placing inoculated poultry in highly exposed
areas to watch the result of infection.
Results of 3 Vaccines Currently Used in China:
----------------------------------------------
A. AI inactivated vaccine (H5 sub-type, N-28 strain)
1) Seed virus: A/Turkey/England/N-28/73, low virulent strain imported from
Weybridge Laboratory Lab in Britain.
2) Result: The antibody level reached the highest rate, namely 8 log2,
during the 5th week after vaccination. This rate was maintained for 4
weeks. The antibody protective level can be sustained into the 23rd week
after vaccination.
3) Feature: The Ministry of Agriculture approved this vaccine as a new
bio-product for animal inoculation in December 2003. This vaccine was
widely used in China during the outbreaks of HPAI at the beginning of 2004.
B. Recombinant AI virus inactivated vaccine (H5N1 sub-type, Re-1 strain)
1) Seed virus: Artificially modified conventional seed virus
A/Goose/Guandong/1996 (H5N1), which is representative for the antigen in
China, to make H5N1 virus inactive through recombination with human flu virus.
2) Result: The antibody reached highest level of 9 log2 during the 3rd week
after vaccination. This rate was maintained for 4 weeks. The antibody
protective level can be sustained into the 25th week after vaccination.
3) Feature: MOA approved this vaccine as a new bio-product for animal
inoculation in January 2005. It works efficiently for avian influenza, it
helps poultry organs generate high levels of antibodies and the protective
period lasts longer. The laboratory experiments proved that waterfowl
inoculated with this vaccine are free of AI infection or infectivity. Many
countries in the world now use this method to try to develop vaccines, but
only China has succeeded and put the vaccine into commercial production.
C. Recombinant fowl pox virus live vaccine for AI (H5 sub-type)
1) Seed virus: Use A/Goose/Guangdong/1996 (H5N1) as part of gene donor to
make a recombinant fowl poxvirus for a live vaccine.
2) Result: The antibody reached the highest level of 7 log2 during the 2nd
week after vaccination. The antibody protective level can be sustained into
the 26th week after vaccination.
3) Feature: The Ministry of Agriculture approved this vaccine as a new
bio-product for animal inoculation in January 2005. It helps create
antibodies against the antigen of specific proteins. Therefore, it is good
to differentiate immunity and field infection. Mexico also has this kind
of vaccine and widely uses it.
During 2005, the Chinese Government will invest over RMB 5 billion
(approximately USD 600 million) in animal disease control. China uses the
3 kinds of poultry vaccines, approved by MOA between Dec 2003 and Jan 2005,
for AI prevention. The above report is an unofficial translation of this
updated AI vaccination information.

[ProMED-mail, which has repeatedly expressed the wish to obtain 1st-hand
information on the Chinese AI vaccines and their certification, welcomes
this GAIN report, which is essentially a Chinese document.
It seems that the above information falls in line with data provided by Dr
David Swayne in his recent update and review (20050307.0680). He described
2 new Chinese vaccines, namely a recombinant fowlpox-H5N1 AI vaccine
(live), and a reverse genetic produced influenza A inactivated
vaccine. The 1st (live) one is most probably the vaccine designated as C
in the above (Chinese) GAIN report, and the 2nd (inactivated) one is the
vaccine designated as B in the report.
The inactivated vaccine, designated as A in the GAIN report, seems to be a
traditional inactivated oil emulsion H5 LP vaccine. Based upon a H5N2 LP
virus, it has been widely used in China during 2004 as a DIVA
(Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals) vaccine.
For the respective advantages of the new vaccines, subscribers are referred
to the said review. - Mod.AS]
