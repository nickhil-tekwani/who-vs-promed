May 9, 1997 - MMWR - Vol. 46 / No. 18
=95Human Rabies - Kentucky and Montana, 1996:
In October and December 1996, a woman in Kentucky and a man in Montana
died from rabies. This report summarizes the clinical courses and
epidemiologic investigations of these cases, which indicate that a bat
was the probable source of exposure for each case.
MMWR Editorial Note: In 1996, four cases of human rabies were documented
in the United States, including the two cases described in this report.
In both of these cases, the rabies virus variant was associated with the
silver-haired bat, L. noctivagans, and in neither case, could a definite
history of bat bite or contact be established. These findings are
consistent with the emerging pattern in the epidemiology of human rabies
in the United States: bat-related virus variants have been identified
from 17 (53%) of the 32 cases of human rabies diagnosed in the United
States since 1980. Of these 17 bat-related cases, 12 (71%) were infected
with a rabies virus variant primarily associated with the silver-haired
bat.=20
A definite bite history could be documented in only one of these 17
bat-related cases; in eight of these instances, although contact with a
bat was reported by the patient, a family member, or friends, in none of
these cases was a bite recognized or a wound evident. These findings
suggest that limited or seemingly insignificant physical contact with
rabid bats may result in transmission of virus, even without a definite
history of animal bite. Therefore, rabies PEP should now be considered
in all situations in which there is reasonable probability that contact
with a bat may have occurred, unless prompt laboratory testing of the
bat has ruled out rabies infection..."=20
