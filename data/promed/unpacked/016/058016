Zhang L, Sun J, Yan J, Lv H, Chai C, Sun Y, et al. Antibodies against severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus in healthy persons, China, 2013.

Abstract
--------
In June 2013, a subclinical infection with severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) was detected in Zhejiang Province, China, prompting seroprevalence studies in 6 districts within the province. Of 986 healthy persons tested, 71 had IgG [immunoglobin G] antibodies against SFTSV. This finding suggests that most natural infections with SFTSV are mild or subclinical.

Background
----------
SFTS [severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome], a serious emerging infectious disease, was 1st reported in rural areas of central China in 2009. The characteristic signs and symptoms of SFTS include fever, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytopenia, and the disease has a case-fatality rate of up to 30 per cent. SFTS is caused by infection with SFTS virus (SFTSV; family _Bunyaviridae_, genus _Phlebovirus_). The virus was 1st isolated in 2010 from patients with SFTS; since then, additional cases have been reported from many areas of China. After the occurrence of SFTS cases in Zhejiang Province, China, in 2013, enhanced surveillance for the disease was implemented.

Conclusions
-----------
SFTSV can cause severe disease and high rates of death among infected hospitalized patients. The virus also has the limited ability to be transmitted from person to person through contact with contaminated blood, but secondary cases are generally less severe and have so far not resulted in fatalities. Nonetheless, there is great public health concern regarding SFTSV.

Our seroprevalence study was prompted by the identification of a subclinical, secondary infection that was most likely caused by person-to-person transmission of the virus from an infected family member with a fatal case of SFTS. We found an overall SFTSV seroprevalence of 7.2 per cent among 986 healthy persons who reported no symptoms associated with SFTS. Because the seropositive participants in our study did not have contact with persons with diagnosed cases of SFTS, their infections most likely occurred through natural exposure. From this, we conclude that SFTSV infections are widespread in rural areas of Zhejiang Province, and only a small percentage of the infections result in clinical disease.

[It is not surprising that there are subclinical infections. Further studies to quantify subclinical or very mild cases where health care facilities are not consulted will further decrease the fatality rate of SFTS virus infections. Nevertheless, SFTS is a serious disease and of significant public health concern. The virus is doubtless endemic in China and other countries in Asia.

[2] South Korea: tick vectors

Yun SM, Lee WG, Ryou J, Yang SC, Park SW, Roh JY, et al. Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus in ticks collected from humans, South Korea, 2013.

Abstract
--------
We investigated the infection rate for severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) among ticks collected from humans during May-October 2013 in South Korea. _Haemaphysalis longicornis_ ticks have been considered the SFTSV vector. However, we detected the virus in _H. longicornis_, _Amblyomma testudinarium_, and _Ixodes nipponensis_ ticks, indicating additional potential SFTSV vectors.

Background
----------
The 1st case of SFTS was reported in China during 2010 (1), and in 2013, SFTSV infections were reported in South Korea and Japan. In South Korea, the 1st human case of SFTS was confirmed in May 2013. _H. longicornis_ ticks comprise the major population of ticks in the environment and have been considered the main vector for SFTSV. SFTSV has been detected in _H. longicornis_ ticks collected from the environment by using the dragging or sweeping methods and from mammals. However, to our knowledge, the prevalence of SFTSV in ticks collected from humans has not been reported. To increase our understanding of SFTSV and its possible vectors, we determined the prevalence of SFTSV infection among various ticks collected from humans nationwide in South Korea during May-October 2013.

Conclusions
-----------
_H. longicornis_ ticks have been considered the principal tick vector of SFTSV; there is limited information on SFTSV infection by other tick species. On the basis of our findings, we propose that _A. testudinarium_ and _Ix. nipponensis_ ticks, from which we detected SFTSV, might serve as potential vectors of this virus in South Korea. However, the presence of viral RNA in a tick does not confirm that the tick can transmit the virus. To our knowledge, _A. testudinarium_ and _Ix. nipponensis_ ticks have not previously been considered as SFTSV vectors. Further studies, including studies to isolate SFTSV from infected tick vectors and laboratory vector competence studies, are needed to confirm whether _A. testudinarium_ and _Ix. nipponensis_ ticks transmit SFTSV to humans.

[As the authors point out, isolation of the virus or demonstration of SFTS virus RNA in the ticks is not sufficient to establish their roles as virus vectors. Laboratory studies to determine their vector efficiencies and field studies to determine the presence of the virus and evidence of natural transmission by these ticks will be required. The results of such studies are awaited with interest.
