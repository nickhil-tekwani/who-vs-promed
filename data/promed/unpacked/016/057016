Subject: Scores hit by salmonella bug
---------------------------------------
A restaurant in Durham [located in northeastern England -Mod.LL] has been
identified as the likely source of a salmonella infection that affected 131
people. 11 people were treated in hospital after the outbreak during May
and June [2003] this year.
The restaurant was closed as environmental health officers investigated the
food poisoning outbreak. In a statement they said they were satisfied
"effective control measures had been put in place to prevent further
cases". The 131 victims accounted for all but 15 salmonella cases in County
Durham over a 7 week period in May and June [2003].
In the same period the previous year, there were only 20 cases throughout
the county.

Salmonella outbreak triggers legislation push
----------------------------------------------
The New Mexico Environment Department and New Mexico Department of Health
on Fri, 20 Jun 2003 confirmed that 33 residents in Clayton [located in
Union County in the northeast corner of the state - Mod. LL] likely
suffered from salmonella poisoning earlier this month.
The news prompted U.S. Rep. Tom Udall of northern New Mexico to cosponsor
legislation aimed at protecting consumers from pathogens in meat and
poultry. HR 2203, known as "Kevin's Law," would give the US Department of
Agriculture (USDA) the authority to enforce food safety and sanitation
standards. The bipartisan legislation is named after Kevin Kowalcyk of
Wisconsin, who died in 2001 at the age of 2 from _E. coli_ O157 disease.
Salmonella is usually transmitted to humans by eating contaminated foods of
animal origin, such as beef, poultry, milk or eggs, but all foods,
including vegetables, may become contaminated. According to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), salmonella causes 1.4 million
illnesses and 600 deaths a year.
The CDC estimate that food-borne diseases cause roughly 76 million
illnesses, 325 000 hospitalizations, and 5 000 deaths each year, despite
the fact that the taxpayers invest more than USD 1 billion annually in
federal food safety inspection programs.
Federal courts have struck down USDA's ability to enforce pathogen
standards for salmonellosis and to require meat grinders to stop using
low-quality, potentially contaminated beef trimmings. A more recent lawsuit
now threatens USDA's ability to shut down a plant that repeatedly violates
basic sanitation standards.
Kevin's Law, introduced by Rep. Anna Eshoo of California, authorizes the
USDA to enforce existing standards for pathogens such as _Salmonella sp._
and _E. coli_. It requires the USDA to set standards for the pathogens
based upon the best available science and reasonably available technology
to reduce contamination. The legislation would also clarify that USDA has
the authority to enforce basic sanitation requirements in meat and poultry
plants.

[Food-borne salmonellosis remains a significant problem in the USA and
worldwide. In the home, the risk can be minimized by appropriate kitchen
hygiene (ie, not contaminating already cooked with uncooked material) and
adequate cooking. In restaurants, the adequacy of cooking cannot be as
easily monitored. Foods that are not cooked further before serving (such
as cold-cut meats) or not cooked at all (such as salads and fruits)
represent a real hazard for tranmitting infection, not only salmonellosis
but many others including listeriosis and hepatitis A. The widespread
distribution of foods from central locations makes the spread of potential
pathogens also widespread.
The specific food or foods associated with these outbreaks is not stated in
these postings. Laws enabling overseeing agencies to better enforce
regulations and/or institute newer ones are always welcome but it is not
likely to eradicate the problem. It is somewhat ironic that the proposed
legislation is called "Kevin's Law" since E. coli O157, at least when
associated with ground beef, can be totally avoided by adequate kitchen
hygiene and cooking similar to avoiding salmonellosis from the Thanksgiving
turkey would be. - Mod.LL]
