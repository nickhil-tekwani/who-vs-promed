Poisonous Russian Mushrooms Kill 11
-------------------------------------
MOSCOW (AP) -- Toxic mushrooms have killed 11 people and sickened 150
others this month [July] in the southern Russian town of Voronezh,
officials said Thursday. One child was among the dead and 18 children among
those injured in the last 12 days, said Alexander Zalyotov, spokesman for
the Emergency Situations Ministry. Zalyotov said sales of wild mushrooms
have been banned in the town 300 miles south of Moscow, and in the
surrounding region.
Gathering wild mushrooms for pickling or soups is a popular summer pastime
for Russians, but often results in poisoning outbreaks that can fell entire
families. As little as a single mushroom cap can be fatal if it's one of
the more toxic varieties. Officials sometimes also blame poisoning on
mushrooms growing in heavily contaminated soil.

More Russians Killed in Mushroom Poisoning
--------------------------------------------
MOSCOW (July 14) XINHUA - Toxic mushrooms have killed 6 people in the
Volgograd region in southern Russia, 4 of whom were under 14 years of age,
the Itar-Tass news agency reported Friday. The deaths came after earlier
reports that 15 people died of the same cause in the western Voronezh
region. 52 people remain hospitalized in the Volgograd region, Tass said.
In Voronezh, where 162 people fell victim to the toxic fungus, mushroom
sales have been banned.

[Voronezh is in the Central Black Earth Economic Region (CBEER) of Russia
located to the south of Moscow. Of interest is the suggestion that the wild
mushrooms may have been purchased rather than harvested individually by
family or friends of the cases. More information on this outbreak would be
greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
