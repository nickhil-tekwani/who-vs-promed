More Thai provinces confirm bird flu outbreaks
-----------------------------------------------
Bird flu was suspected of spreading to over 8 provinces, and confirmed in
more than 10 provinces, in Thailand, according to the Thai Deputy Prime
Minister, Chaturon Chaisaeng, who said that the Cabinet would meet on
Monday [19 Jul 2004] to decide whether to penalize farms, that violate the
ban on the use of vaccines, by closing them.
Thailand Food and Drugs Agency (FDA) has not approved the use of bird-flu
vaccines, because scientific research has yet to determine whether
consuming vaccinated chickens would pose a health risk to humans.
Chaturon has assigned Yukol Limlaethong, director-general of Livestock
Development, to arrange strict measures to prevent bird flu from spreading
any further. The movement of farming equipment will be prohibited, and
farmers will be required to buy chickens only from closed-system production
facilities. Yukol said vaccination would be a last resort.
Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra said bird flu had broken out again,
because officials had failed to completely wipe it out earlier this year
[2004].
In Chiang Saen district, in Chiang Rai province, police have arrested a man
with 200 bottles of suspected bird-flu vaccine. He confessed to smuggling
the drug in to sell in Bangkok.

[2] Thailand: considering vaccination

New panel to tackle bird flu
----------------------------
The government will set up a national-level committee for combating avian
influenza, and, give it 2 months to decide whether to introduce bird-flu
vaccination in critical areas, Agriculture Minister Somsak Thepsuthin said
yesterday [Sun 18 Jul 2004].
The government is looking for a permanent solution to the disease that has
affected the country's poultry industry since early this year [2004].
However, inoculation is a subject of heated debate, because some vaccinated
fowl could carry the disease without showing symptoms, possibly putting
humans at risk in the long run.
Somsak announced the plan to experiment with the vaccine yesterday [Sun 18
Jul 2004] after a meeting with relevant agencies that was called in the
wake of fresh outbreaks of bird-flu. He said the national-level committee
on bird-flu would be assigned to research, extensively, ways to contain and
prevent outbreaks of the disease.
Somsak said the committee would be comprised of experts from the Veterinary
Council of Thailand, the Public Health Ministry, and various universities.
"The committee should have all the information ready within 2 months,
including the vaccine issue," he said.
After the research, the bird-flu vaccine should be experimented with in
some areas, Somsak said, adding that the vaccine would remain banned
outside the trial areas. "We have to move cautiously, because the disease
could spread unnoticed and pass on to humans," warned Dr. Supamit
Chunsuttiwat, a doctor from the Disease Control Division.
Dr. Wantanee Palprawit, of the Veterinary Council, explained that bird-flu
vaccine was just part of the plan to contain the disease permanently. She
said each country had different conditions, and thus, the fact that
Indonesia and China could use the vaccine did not guarantee that Thailand
could use it too. [According to the Bangkok Post, cited by the Viet Nam
News Agency on 18 Jul 2004, Thailand plans to invite a group of Chinese
experts working in infectious diseases to help conduct the experiment on
the H5N1 virus strain of bird flu. - Mod.AS].
Dr. Pirophan Puttawattana, chief virologist at Mahidol University, said the
bird-flu strain found in Thailand was H5N1, with minimal mutation, and
could not yet be passed between humans. "It's only a bit different from the
H5N1 strain that was 1st found in Hong Kong 7 years ago," said Dr. Yong
Puwan, from Chulalongkorn University's Faculty of Medicine.
Livestock Development Department director-general Yukol Limlamthong said
the fresh outbreak of bird-flu remained restricted to small areas in
13 provinces. He said his department planned to propose a zoning plan for
fowl control. "If we enforce the zoning, we will be able to know more about
the local problems in each zone, and, will be able to react more swiftly,
and efficiently, in case any problem arises," he said.

Bird flu calm in Thailand and China
-----------------------------------
Thailand's fresh outbreak of bird flu was spreading Friday [16 Jul 2004],
but officials said the deadly virus, which ravaged Asian fowl flocks early
in 2004, was under control in Viet Nam and China.
Bird flu has now spread to 15 of Thailand's 76 provinces since the 1st
recurrence just over a week ago [2nd week July 2004].
Officials said they were also awaiting laboratory tests on suspected cases
of the H5N1 virus, which killed 16 Vietnamese, and 8 Thais, who came in
close contact with infected fowl earlier in 2004, in 8 districts of
Bangkok. The fresh outbreak, in what was the world's 4th biggest chicken
exporter before the earlier epidemic, has devastated the Thai industry and
hit the stock market, which fell almost one percent on Thu 15 Jul 2004.
There have been no reports of anyone in China, Viet Nam, or Thailand
falling ill from bird flu in the latest outbreaks, officials in the 3
countries said. But, the government has put Thailand on high alert,
ordering officials to rush anyone to the hospital showing any symptoms that
resemble those of bird flu.
Officials in China and Viet Nam said their outbreaks had been contained,
and no new cases had been reported. "The virus is not spreading. There have
not been any new cases," Bui Quang Anh, head of the Agriculture Ministry's
animal health department in Hanoi, told Reuters.
"We are cooperating closely with OIE to evaluate the situation," he added,
referring to the Paris-based World Organization for Animal Health.
Viet Nam has confirmed outbreaks of bird flu in 7 provinces, and, has
culled 10 000 poultry, mostly ducks, to prevent the virus from spreading.
Thailand has culled more than 40 000 poultry in the latest outbreaks so
far, a figure dwarfed by the 60 million it slaughtered earlier in 2004.
In China, officials said 28 000 chickens had been culled, and 190 000
vaccinated, to contain the H5N1 outbreak. China would release the last
group of 114 people, who came into contact with chickens at the site of an
outbreak, and, were under clinical observation, in the next few days, the
officials said.
"China has stepped up inspection of border trade between the southern
region of Guangxi and Viet Nam, after poultry samples from the south of
Viet Nam were found infected with bird flu," China's quarantine bureau said
on its web-site:
.
Officials in Thailand and China have blamed wild birds -- especially
waterfowl, highly suspected of causing the main outbreak early in 2004 --
for the new cases. But, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the
United Nations food body, said poor hygienic practices were to blame.
"Killing wild birds will not help to prevent, or control, avian influenza
outbreaks," said Juan Lubroth of the FAO animal health service. "To date,
there is no scientific evidence that wildlife is the major factor in the
resurgence of the disease in the region."
Poor hygienic practices in production, processing, and marketing of
poultry, contaminated products, and, individuals not following recommended
control measures were probably to blame, he said.

'Trigger point' alert system if number of flu cases rise suddenly
-----------------------------------------------
The Health Ministry has introduced a "trigger point" to alert the
authorities of the bird flu virus in the event of a sudden rise in flu
cases in the country.
Its minister, Datuk Dr. Chua Soi Lek, said the authorities would be placed
on high alert if more than the average number of flu cases were detected
per day.
He said the ministry had alerted public health clinics and hospitals to
watch out for bird flu symptoms.
"If there are any unusual increase[s] in flu cases, all entry points will
be placed on high alert, especially in the north," he said, at a dialogue,
organized by the state MCA Wanita, here yesterday [Sun 18 Jul 2004].
Dr. Chua was commenting on a World Health Organization (WHO) report over
a possible emergence of a flu strain capable of sparking a pandemic
among humans.
With several new cases of the highly infectious Pathogenic Avian Influenza
reported in China, Thailand and Viet Nam, WHO had asked authorities to take
all necessary precautions when culling infected poultry.
In the event of an outbreak, Dr. Chua said farms should be cordoned off to
prevent the spread of the deadly virus.
"To date, no cases have been reported in Malaysia, so there is no reason to
be anxious," he said, adding that the Health Ministry would work with the
Agriculture, and Agro-Based Industry Ministry, to prevent the bird flu
virus from entering the country.

[Last week, ProMED-mail posted several Malaysian news items describing an
outbreak of flu-like illness in about 70 students in an agricultural
school, allegedly suspected to have been infected from poultry (see
20040716.1923). Avian flu was ruled out.
Reportedly, the Health Department took phlegm samples, and throat swabs,
adding that definitive tests using cultures would be completed by 23 Jul
2004 at the earliest.
No additional information regarding the said outbreak has become available
since 14 Jul 2004. The outcome of clinical and laboratory investigations,
if available, will be appreciated. - Mod.AS].
