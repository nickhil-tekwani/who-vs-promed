Another case of anthrax has been registered in Georgia. The news
agency Kavkaz Press has been informed about this case in Tbilisi
infectious diseases hospital. A 39 year old man from the village
Ivanovka in the Kakheti region has been admitted to the hospital with
fever and a skin rash.

A diagnosis of skin anthrax has been confirmed, and the patient is
receiving appropriate treatment.

This man contracted anthrax while taking care of a cow. Currently, his
condition is stable. The doctors mention about twice the usual anthrax
morbidity in Georgia [in 2011]. One fatal anthrax case has been
registered in Georgia in 2011.

[This newswire shows that the outbreaks are continuing in the
provinces south of Tbilisi along the country's southern border,
presumably in the Azerbajani communities as noted before. As anthrax
is essentially non-contagious, we can assume that the journalist's
report of "taking care of a cow" meant that he had slaughtered and
butchered a cow suffering from anthrax.
