British officials fear BSE water contamination
--------------------------------------------------
Officials in Britain are scrambling to find cattle that were culled to
combat foot-and-mouth, after warnings the carcasses might have to be dug up
to protect humans from mad cow disease. Scientists have confirmed that
cattle born before strict measures were put in place in 1996 to stop the
spread of the disease could now be contaminating water supplies. The
scientists say up to 10 000 cattle over 5 years old have been buried in at
least 55 sites across Britain. A recent scientific paper found most body
fluids could have leaked out of the carcasses within 2 months, giving
officials little time to pinpoint the location of all the sites involved.
The scientists say contaminated water could transmit to humans a variant of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which causes the brain to become spongy and wither.

Maff knew of BSE risk before cattle burials
------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Agriculture (Maff) allowed cattle at risk of carrying BSE
to be buried as part of the foot and mouth cull for 5 weeks despite being
warned against it before the slaughter started, it emerged yesterday. The
practice has been effectively banned since the end of March because of the
danger of infective protein entering the soil or water sources. But a
senior official from the environment agency said the presumption had been
from the start of the outbreak that older cattle should not be buried. "We
were very surprised to find animals over 5 years old had been buried," said
Geoffrey Bateman, coordinating the agency's part of the cross-departmental
response to the epidemic.
Yesterday 7 new cases of the disease were identified: 4 in Skipton, north
Yorkshire, bringing the total around the town to 12 in 10 days. Extra
movement restrictions have been imposed on farms throughout the area, which
includes Settle and Clitheroe, in Lancashire; 2 more cases were reported in
Cumbria and one in Cleveland, as the overall total climbed to 1668.
The health department attempted to reassure the public about the low risk
of infection or pollution from carcasses waiting for disposal. It also
promised that monitoring would continue long after the epidemic had waned.
It insisted that routine checks had been in place since the start, although
it emerged that extra monitoring was not conducted until long after. Checks
on air pollution around pyres started in April and the food standards
agency only began systematic monitoring as cattle were turned out of winter
quarters to graze a few weeks ago. It has already warned of a small extra
risk to health from full-fat dairy products from farms near pyres.
Mr Bateman's potentially embarrassing remarks were countered by a Maff
spokesman, who said: "Where other options were not available they were
content we should bury." He added that the risks from contamination with
BSE prions from the remains of old cattle were very small.
Advisers on the threat of BSE have said that rendering and incineration of
older cattle is far safer than burial. About 10 000 cattle over 5 years old
were buried early in the epidemic, mainly along the Welsh borders, near
Worcester and Gloucester and in the northeast and northwest. Of these, an
estimated 40 may have been infected taking into account current levels of
BSE in the national herd. Such older animals are banned from food.
The environment agency is now checking an estimated 55 burial sites where
older cows were buried to reassess the potential risks and is trying to
ensure that disinfectant used on farms to clean up after culls does not
leach into water.
Pat Troop, deputy chief medical officer, denied any suggestion that health
concerns had been downplayed. Given that 4 million animals would be
destroyed to contain foot and mouth, the vast majority of carcasses had
been "disposed of in an extraordinarily effective and safe way". The
authorities had had a huge problem to deal with, and it had been recognised
that in the early stages, people may have made decisions they would not
have made later on.
A Department of Health summary published yesterday said that while the risk
of humans acquiring foot and mouth is extremely small, "disposal of
carcasses on the scale now being undertaken cannot be carried out without
some risk to human health." It listed its preferred order of disposal, with
the boiling down of remains as the safest option.
