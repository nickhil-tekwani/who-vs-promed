A panel of senior officials investigating last year's [2007] mysterious
deaths of livestock, including some 5000 camels, across the Kingdom
yesterday [29 Jan 2008] attributed the deaths to contaminated feed supplied
by a flourmill in Khamis Mushayt in the southern Asir Region [For location,
see map at <http://www.fallingrain.com/world/SA/0/Khamis_Mushayt.html>. -
Mod.AS].

The panel ruled out any criminal motives behind the contamination. "The 1st
cases of camel deaths that were reported in Riyadh, Asir, Makkah, Najran,
and Jizan regions took place at short intervals in August 2007," the panel
said in a statement. A 2nd wave of camel deaths were reported in Yanbu in
December 2007. Farmers there also said their animals died after eating
contaminated feed.

Tests conducted on animals showed that toxins in animal feed rather than a
contagious disease caused the deaths. "The tests were carried out on
samples taken from dead animals and suspicious feed," the Ministry of
Agriculture said. "The results showed that the samples contained
salinomycin, a compound to which camels are highly allergic [Preferably,
"susceptible" should be used here rather than "allergic". - Mod.AS].
Laboratory tests showed that the bran used to feed camels contained high
concentrations of this compound," the ministry said.

Earlier this month [January 2008], Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King
Abdullah ordered payment of SAR 20 000 [USD 5340] in compensation for each
dead animal to their owners.

According to press reports, nearly 5000 camels and other animals died in
various parts of the Kingdom. Agriculture minister Dr Fahd Balghunaim
consistently ruled out claims that the deaths were caused by an infectious
disease. The minister said a common factor in all the deaths was that their
fodder feedstock was bran. "We took bran samples from locations where these
camels died and subjected them to tests in the veterinary laboratories."
The Kingdom's camel population is estimated at 850 000. Ministry officials
point out that camel breeding in the Kingdom is undertaken for various
purposes, racing, milk, and also for beauty contests.

[The above information on the etiology of the extensive camel mortality in
Saudi Arabia, and on the source of the damaging contaminated bran, is
warmly welcomed. Eventually, transparency prevailed.

This major animal health event has illuminated the exceptionally high
vulnerability of camels to residues of the ionophore salinomycin in their
feed. It is to be hoped that the Saudi authorities will now upgrade their
feed control system and the supportive relevant infrastructure.

Background information on salinomycin intoxication and its prevention can
be found in Chapter 6.1 "Feed contamination: toxicity in animals" of the
review paper by JDG McEvoy, "Contamination of animal feedingstuffs as a
cause of residues in food: a review of regulatory aspects, incidence and
control" [Analytica Chimica Acta 2002; 473: 3-26], which addresses toxic
episodes in a wide range of food and companion animal species following
feedingstuffs contamination with polyether ionophores in-feed additives.
These compounds (monensin, salinomycin, narasin, lasalocid, maduramycin,
and semduramycin) have been the predominant means of chemical control of
coccidiosis in poultry for many years because of the slow development of
resistant strains to them relative to other anticoccidial drugs. Monensin
is also used as a growth promoter in cattle. However, all the ionophores
have a narrow safety margin and readily induce cardiomyopathies and muscle
damage in susceptible species. The horse in particular is very sensitive to
the effects of polyether ionophores, and fatalities have been reported with
the typical dose rate for chickens causing intoxication. Reports have been
published for various food animals (rabbits, pigs, turkeys, ostriches,
quail, poultry, sheep, goats, and cattle), as well as for camels, dogs, and
cats.

A single case of suspected human salinomycin intoxication was described in
New Zealand in 2004, in which a patient ingested an estimated 1 mg/kg of
salinomycin, resulting in a 6-week hospital admission with prolonged
rhabdomyolysis, pain, and disability. The authors stated that it was likely
that his initial presentation with diaphoresis and tachycardia was
attributable to the sympathomimetic properties of salinomycin. See: Story

antibiotic. NZ Med J 2004 Mar 12;117(1190): U799. - Mod.AS]
