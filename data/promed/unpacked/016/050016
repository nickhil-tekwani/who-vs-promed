A potentially fatal disease, previously a rarity in New Zealand, has
hospitalized 11 people in the Waikato region since May 2006.
The Waikato Times reported yesterday [29 Sep 2006] 11 cases of infection
with _Rickettsia typhi_, a close relative of typhus [louse-borne epidemic
typhus is caused by _R. prowazekii_], have been identified in 2006, with
doctors concerned other cases could be going undiagnosed. The disease was
usually transmitted by fleas from rats, sometimes from bites, or from
inhalation of airborne flea feces.
Before this year [2006], there have only been 25 cases recorded in New Zealand.
The disease, also known as murine typhus, causes severe fever, headache,
muscle pain, dry coughs, nausea, vomiting, and often a rash, and can
sometimes be confused with influenza.
All 11 patients were hospitalized with the disease, but doctors said there
were possibly a lot more people in the Waikato who had the disease and did
not know it. All 11 Waikato cases were in rural areas or on lifestyle
blocks. [The term "lifestyle block" was introduced by some New Zealand real
estate agents in the 1980s to describe a rural smallholding attractive to
people who wished to live a rural lifestyle but whose income derived from
non-farming activities. - Mod.LL]

[There are 5 diseases with typhus literally, or figuratively, in their
names: epidemic typhus, Brill-Zinsser disease (recrudescent epidemic
typhus), murine typhus, scrub typhus, and typhoid (so-called because it is
typhus-like). The term typhus comes from the Greek, _typhein_ -- to smoke
-- which may refer to the smoky or clouded mental status that patients
present with.
Murine typhus, caused by _Rickettsia typhi_, is distributed widely
throughout the world, especially in the warm and humid coastal environments
of tropic and subtropical climes. In the developed world, the infection is
found along the eastern coasts of the south Atlantic states in the USA, the
Caribbean, the Pacific coasts of the southwestern USA, as well as Hawaii.
In Europe, it is distributed along the Mediterranean coast as well as the
Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts of Africa.
It is a zoonosis, in which rats function as the disease's asymptomatic
reservoir, and the Oriental rat flea _Xenopsylla cheopis_ is the most
common vector. Although generally coastal in distribution, the disease may
well spread away from the coast via major routes of transportation.
Although rickettsia-infected flea feces being rubbed into a flea bite
appears to be the major vehicle of transmission to man, flea bites
themselves, and aerosolization of flea feces, may transmit infection as well.
Murine typhus is a relatively mild disease as compared to epidemic typhus.
Among patients admitted to an acute care hospital with this disease, only
10 percent require intensive care, but 1-4 percent die.
Diagnosis is based on serology. However, identification of rickettsiae in
smear or culture of skin lesions may be performed by specialized laboratories.
The typical adult therapy consists of doxycycline 100 mg BID for 3 to 5 days.
A map showing the distribution of the disease throughout the world can be
found at:

Although New Zealand is not indicated on the map, _R. typhi_ infection has
been clearly described before. As an example (Kelly P, Roberts S, Fournier
P-E: A review of emerging flea-borne bacterial pathogens in New Zealand
Journal of the New Zealand Medical Association, 2005;118: 1-9):
"Locally acquired murine typhus due to _R. typhi_ was 1st reported in 1991.
Subsequently, 20 patients from the greater Auckland region have been
diagnosed with the disease (unpublished data, S. Roberts). The majority of
patients lived in northwest Auckland around the Kaipara Harbour, but 3
cases have occurred in the Coromandel Peninsula region. It is highly likely
that it is present in other regions throughout New Zealand, especially
those close to current or historic ports. _R. typhi_ DNA has been detected
by PCR in rats captured on the properties of 2 patients but not in fleas
obtained from rats or domestic animals."

region south of Auckland can be found at:
