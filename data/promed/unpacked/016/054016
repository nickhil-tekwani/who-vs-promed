Bangladesh: more birds culled with avian flu
--------------------------------------------
A total of 6000 poultry birds were culled and 29 000 eggs damaged
following an outbreak of bird flu [avian A/(H5N1) influenza virus
infection] at a hatchery at Kashada village under Shivalaya upazila
[sub district] on Tuesday and Wednesday night [12-13 Apr 2011].

Some poultry birds of Pioneer Breeders Limited died in the last 3
days. The hatchery owner took samples of dead birds to the local
disease examination centre of the livestock department.

There it was detected that the fowls were attacked with bird flu,
deputy director of livestock department Hossain Mohammad said.

Shivalaya upazila nirbahi officer [chief executive of a sub-district]
Kaikobad Hossain and concerned officials were present during the
culling of the birds, he said.

[According to available information (see reference below), "In
Bangladesh, about 89 per cent of rural households have backyard
poultry, and many households keep chickens and ducks on the same
property. In the absence of fences or other barriers, backyard
chickens roam freely from one property to another. Because backyard
chickens are reared in such free range systems, they are more
vulnerable to the HPAI (H5N1) virus infection; and, if they become
infected, they can transmit the virus to domestic ducks, in which the
virus can perpetuate and infect more backyard chickens. This cycle of
virus transmission between backyard chickens and ducks would continue
until intercepted."

It seems that the cycle described has been continuing since the start
of the epizootic in February 2007, at times -- as in the current case
-- penetrating into commercial flocks. Vaccination is not allowed in
Bangladesh. So far, 480 of the outbreaks have been officially
reported; the most recent OIE follow-up report, no 31, was submitted
on 24 Mar 2011. All reports and an interactive map showing the
location of the outbreaks are available at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=5154.

So far, 3 human cases of H5N1 have been reported from Bangladesh by
the WHO, one in 2008, 2 during 2011; no mortalities.
