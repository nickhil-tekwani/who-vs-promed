Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: In late July [2019], the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority (MAST) was notified about an increase in daily mortality (0.5%) in 23-day-old broilers in the oldest flock on a broiler farm with 4 units. Subsequently, the other flocks on the same farm also got affected. The birds were diagnosed with both viral inclusion body hepatitis (IBH) and infectious bursal disease (IBD). Post-mortem examination revealed hepatitis with eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies and an extensive lymphoid depletion in lymphoid organs, especially in the bursa of Fabricius. Attempts to verify adenovirus as the cause of hepatitis have been unsuccessful. Serology for IBD was positive, and the presence of IBDV was confirmed with PCR. Genotyping is pending. Infectious bursal disease (IBD, Gumboro disease) has not been detected in Iceland since 1998, and vaccination against the disease is not practiced. Birds with clinical symptoms either died or were humanely killed. All carcasses were securely disposed of. The remaining birds were slaughtered under the strict supervision of veterinary officers. Intensive cleaning and disinfection of the premises have been carried out. Certain measures are planned to be applied as an attempt to eradicate the virus from the affected premises such as prolonged downtime of the rearing units for a few months and temporary vaccination of the parent flocks and the broilers.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; traceability; quarantine; official destruction of animal products; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; stamping out; disinfection; slaughter; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone

Diagnostic test results
1. Laboratory name and type: National Veterinary Institute SVA, Sweden (foreign laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Birds / antibody detection ELISA / 20 Aug 2019 / positive
2. GD Animal Health, Netherlands (private laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Birds / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 9 Sep 2019 / positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Infectious bursal disease (IBD) is an OIE-listed, non-zoonotic disease of poultry, distributed globally. The causative virus (IBDV, genus _Avibirnavirus_, family Birnaviridae) infects chickens, turkeys, ducks, guinea fowl, and ostriches, but causes clinical disease solely in young chickens. Severe acute disease, usually at 3-6-week-old birds, is associated with high mortality, but less acute or subclinical infections are common earlier in life.

IBDV causes lymphoid depletion in the bursa of Fabricius. Significant depression of the humoral antibody responses may result, thus promoting secondary infections. Two serotypes of IBDV, designated serotypes 1 and 2, are recognised. Clinical disease has been associated only with serotype 1, against which all commercial vaccines are prepared. Some antigenic variants of serotype 1 IBDV may require special vaccines for maximum protection. Very virulent strains of serotype 1 IBDV are common worldwide and cause serious disease.

Clinical IBD, also known as Gumboro disease, can be diagnosed by a combination of characteristic signs and post-mortem lesions. Subclinical IBD can be confirmed in the laboratory by demonstrating a humoral immune response to IBDV in unvaccinated chickens, or by detecting viral antigens or viral genome in tissues. In the absence of such tests, histological examination of bursae may be helpful.

For additional information, in particular IBDV diagnostic techniques and vaccine requirements, please refer to the OIE Manual, chapter 3.3.12, at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/fr/Health_standards/tahm/3.03.12_IBD.pdf. - Mod.AS
