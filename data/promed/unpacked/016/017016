SKIN SAMPLE FROM THIRD EYELID COULD BE EFFECTIVE SCRAPIE TEST
May 12/98

New and notable: The Canadian Food Inspection Agency's acting chief of
epidemiology, Dr. Ron Rogers, was cited as saying CFIA will co-operate with
the USDA to evaluate the effectiveness of the eyelid technique. CFIA staff
will visit the Washington research station to see the technique performed,
and will study Canadian strains of scrapie to see if domestic strains can
be detected with the eyelid test.
So far this year scrapie has been confirmed in seven flocks in Quebec and
two in Ontario, with 3,400 sheep destroyed in a bid to control the disease.
About 4,200 scrapie-infected sheep were slaughtered in Canada during 1997.

[Earlier I had been in conversation with Don Knowles of the team the
developed this test and who kindly faxed me a copy of their Veterinary
Record paper - our library had not yet received a copy. MHJ

An epidemiological question, what are the sensitivity and specificity of
this test in your opinion?
>From reading your paper, the sensitivity is 100% for clinical cases
(9test+ve/9 confirmed cases). For specificity (negative test when healthy)
you had 22 sheep, all tested negative. On necropsy 12 tested -ve/12 histo
path -ve (100% specific), but with ten Suffolks being held back to see what
happens. So far so good though numbers are necessarily small.
The predictive run with 16 suspect sheep out of scrapie flocks had all
testing positive. So far 6 have developed clinical and histopath +ve
scrapie. The remaining 10 have been held back. So it looked good but
...what has happened since?
Do you have any other data? What about the not-quoted data? ... You quote
using ?10 flocks (fax was unreadable) for testing, which must have been
some >250 sheep to select from or test in total.

We are the middle of obtaining data to answer your questions. As you
indicated the numbers reported in the Veterinary Record paper are small. We
realize that the key issue is disease definition.
Therefore we are, with some major collaborative efforts, continuing to
study as many flocks as we can. The groups of sheep we are looking at are
(i) low risk, by the best definitions we can apply in the U. S., (ii) high
risk, i.e. those that are from flocks with confirmed scrapie and test
eyelid positive and (iii) high risk, those from high risk flocks that test
negative. Of course the specificity issue has been a bit easier to gain
numbers on, i.e. sheep that test negative and stay negative. The problem
here is one of waiting a long enough period to confirm the negatives.
Another complicating issue is controlling exposure during the waiting
period. So far the continuing data looks good. We hope to have data for a
follow-up paper in this next year.
One of the many issues we have been concerned about is the fact that the
mAb we developed for this assay recognizes an epitope on the prion protein,
but is not specific for PrP-Sc. However, to date, we have not been able to
drive a negative sheep to positive regardless of the amount of antibody we
apply. We have been able to get peer review from a number of sources, in
terms of the reading of the immunohistochemistry and we have been very
appreciative of this help. So far so good, but as you know, the only way to
find the problems that must exist, is to look. I hope this information is
helpful.
