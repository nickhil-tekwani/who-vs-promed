Polio virus resurfaces in Ethiopia: vaccination drive targets 100 million
----------------------------------
A child in Ethiopia has been diagnosed with polio, marking that country's
1st case in 4 years and dealing a further setback to plans to eradicate the
disease, international health authorities said on Thursday. The discovery
makes Ethiopia the 14th country to experience a resurgence of the disease
since polio began to spread from northern Nigeria in mid-2003 after several
provinces suspended vaccination.
The World Health Organization and the United Nations Childrens' Fund
announced the Ethiopian case on Thursday as authorities prepared for an
immunization drive in 22 African countries beginning on Saturday that aims
to inoculate 100 million children.
Because genetic fingerprinting has not been completed, the WHO was not able
to say with certainty that the polio virus affecting the child in Ethiopia
is the same strain that leaked from northern Nigeria when provinces there
ceased vaccinating from mid-2003 to mid-2004. "But it can't just have
appeared," said Oliver Rosenbauer of the WHO's polio eradication program.
"We assume it is part of the ongoing epidemic."
Health authorities greeted the news with dismay because every recognized
case signals the existence of a silent epidemic: For every child paralyzed
by polio, there are usually up to 200 more who do not show symptoms but can
still spread the virus to others [the range of paralysis to infected ratio
observed in polio epidemics is 1 in 50 to 1 in 1000 - Mod.MPP]. In
addition, many of the countries where polio still exists lack the
scientific capacity to confirm its presence, so tests must be sent to labs
in the developed world for confirmation -- and in the weeks or months it
takes for infections to be confirmed, the disease can spread.
Since the Nigerian suspension of vaccination, polio has flared up in 12
additional African countries, from Guinea on the west coast to Sudan on the
east coast, as well as in Saudi Arabia, where one case was found in
November [2004] and another in December [2004] during the annual visit of 2
million religious pilgrims.
All of those countries had earlier been declared polio-free. In 4 of them
-- Burkina Faso, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire and the Sudan -- polio has begun
passing from person to person again, say health officials. In Sudan, where
polio eradication efforts are disrupted by civil unrest, there have been
125 cases of the disease since last May [2004].
The international campaign to eradicate polio by 2005 was launched in 1988
at a cost so far of about USD 3 billion. Run by WHO, UNICEF, and the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the effort is carried out in
the field by Rotary International volunteers.

Ethiopia records polio case as virus spreads
--------------------------------------------
A 2 year old girl has contracted polio in Ethiopia, in another sign that
the epidemic is spreading across Africa, the World Health Organization
(WHO) said on Friday. It was the 14th previously polio-free country to
record an imported case, including 13 in Africa, posing a fresh setback to
the United Nations campaign to halt transmission of the crippling virus by
year-end.
WHO officials say the virus originated in Nigeria 18 months ago, after the
northern state of Kano suspended vaccinations, and has traveled east as far
as Sudan and Saudi Arabia.
"The (Ethiopian) Ministry of Health team has reported back that they have
seen the 1st case and are looking at another suspect case today," Bruce
Aylward, coordinator of the WHO's global polio eradication initiative, told
a news briefing. "This virus will move relentlessly forward unless it is
stopped with high-quality (immunization) campaigns. There is a big risk of
further spread if these aren't successful," he said.
The confirmed case -- the 1st [in] Ethiopia in 4 years -- and the suspected
cases occurred in different areas of Tigray province close to Sudan's
border, WHO officials said. It coincided with a mass synchronized
immunization drive starting this weekend in 22 countries across the
continent that aims to reach 100 million children under age 5.
David Heymann, head of the WHO eradication program, said: "In Africa, it is
a setback, but the population is less dense than in Asia, and there is a
will there to really do the campaign in every country." The number of new
cases rose 50 per cent worldwide to 1185 in 2004, largely because of the
continuing spread in Nigeria.
Africa's polio epidemic erupted after a 10-month halt in immunization in
Kano where Muslim elders said the vaccines were part of a Western plot to
spread HIV and infertility, according to WHO officials. Nigeria, Africa's
most populous country, recorded 763 cases in 2004, accounting for 2/3 of
the toll. It resumed immunization in July 2004.

Coast-to-coast polio drive to counter epidemic in Africa
--------------------------------------------------------
A mass polio immunization drive starting today across Africa gained greater
urgency from reports that a child has contracted polio in Ethiopia, the 1st
case there in 4 years.
The cross-continental drive -- spanning 22 countries and reaching 100
million children -- is the 1st in a series of 2005 campaigns to stamp out
polio in Africa, which saw a fierce resurgence during 2004, endangering
global eradication efforts. With polio now in its low-transmission season,
the next few months are critical to stopping the virus.
Countries joining the campaigns this round include the Democratic Republic
of Congo, Ethiopia, and Eritrea on the southern and eastern edges of the
epidemic. In the west, Cote d'Ivoire is rejoining the effort for the 1st
time since civil unrest halted activities last November [2004], causing
months of concern after the country was re-infected early in the regional
epidemic.
"By reaching children cut off from the eradication effort by insecurity and
the threat of violence, African leaders have a real opportunity to halt
polio's advance," said Dr. Ezio Murzi, UNICEF Regional Director for West
and Central Africa. On the other side of the continent, Sudanese health
officials -- in the wake of the Nairobi peace accord -- are cooperating to
immunize children in both the north and south. Next door, Ethiopia is
concentrating on activities along its northern and western borders, where
the new case was found.
In a reminder of the ease with which the virus travels, 2 recent cases in
Saudi Arabia appear to be related to virus originating in Nigeria and
entering via Sudan. Nigeria accounts for over 60 percent of cases
worldwide. [The 2nd case reported in Saudi Arabia with date of onset in
late December 2004, was reported in ProMED-mail in "Poliomyelitis - Saudi
Arabia: Haj concerns 20050211.0463". At that time there was concern over
poliovirus circulation in Saudi Arabia coincident with the Haj. It has
subsequently been learned that the affected child's household had family
visitors from Nigeria preceding the onset of the child's illness, reducing
the likelihood that the infection was from widespread poliovirus
circulation in Saudi Arabia. - Mod.MPP]
"Eradication in Africa requires not only reaching all children in the
newly-infected areas, but most importantly, immunizing every child in those
countries which have never interrupted transmission -- Nigeria and Niger,"
said WHO Regional Director for Africa Dr Luis Sambo. "It is gratifying to
note that both countries are fully committed to the polio eradication drive."
Health officials say that progress made since the 1st response to the
outbreak in Africa -- massive coordinated immunization campaigns in October
and November 2004 -- has been positive but fragile. Success in the 2nd
phase of this intensified eradication effort, coupled with improved access
to routine immunization, is critical to stopping the epidemic. To finance
the 2005 immunization rounds, USD $75 million is needed by July; some UDS
$200 million will be required in 2006. African leaders have re-doubled
their commitment in the face of the epidemic, as evidenced in recent
declarations at the African Union summit by the AU's top leadership. "Polio
eradication has the unswerving commitment of all Africans -- from leaders
to parents and children themselves," said Marie-Irene Richmond-Ahoua,
Rotary's National PolioPlus Chair for Cote d'Ivoire. Since 1985, Rotary
members have contributed countless volunteer hours and more than USD $500
million to the polio eradication effort
Vaccinators will be delivering vitamin A drops with the polio vaccine in
many places -- an immunity-boosting strategy that has saved an estimated
1.2 million lives over 12 years. Further mass polio vaccination campaigns
in Africa are scheduled for April and May and again late in the year.

[From the most recent case counts available on the polio eradication
website, as of 4 Jan 2005, the 2004 reported cases from Africa included:
Nigeria 786 cases, Sudan 124 (with 1 case reported in 2005), Central
African Republic 30, Niger 25, Chad 23, Cote d'Ivoire 17, Cameroon 13, Mali
18, Burkina Faso 9, Benin 6, Guinea 5, Egypt 1, and Botswana 1.
Readers are reminded that the countries considered endemic for polio in
2003 were Nigeria, Niger and Egypt, and the cases in the other countries
were related to the outbreak in Nigeria
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/fixed/casecount.shtml>. The cases
in all countries mentioned above except for Niger and Egypt, and the
previously mentioned cases in Saudi Arabia, are all related to the outbreak
in Nigeria.
Information on the genetic profile of the isolate from Ethiopia is still
pending, but it is highly likely it will be related to the currently
circulating Nigeria or Sudan viruses (which are themselves related). The
mention of a suspected 2nd case (in the 2nd newswire) is of concern that
there may be more widespread circulation of poliovirus in the affected
region in Ethiopia.
The unfortunate consequences of the cessation of polio vaccination in
Nigeria for a year (mid-2003 to mid-2004) continue to be felt, with cases
in countries that have previously interrupted polio transmission. The
obvious concerns are the reseeding of poliovirus circulation into countries
with worsening civil unrest, and disrupted health infrastructures that
serve as barriers to provision of routine services. We await further
information on the genetic typing of the virus isolated from this most
recent case in Ethiopia. - Mod.MPP]
