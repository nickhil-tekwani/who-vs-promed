A deadly banana disease, xanthomonas wilt, has attacked all sectors of Nyagatare District [Eastern Province].

There is a need to involve local leaders to mobilize the communities so that large control measures can be implemented as soon as possible. The Rwanda Agriculture Board [RAB] has visited residents to sensitize them on how to fight the banana disease. RAB has asked to cut and uproot the affected banana plants as well as providing timely information when new infections occur in the area.

Muganwa Stanley, Vice-Mayor of Economics and Development in Nyagatare, has said that farmers do not provide timely information when their banana plants are attacked, fearing that affected bananas may be uprooted.

[_Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _musacearum_ is the causal organism of banana bacterial wilt in central Africa (BXW; bacterial wilts due to _Ralstonia_ species are present elsewhere). It affects all banana types causing wilting and premature ripening of fruit. An incidence of 70-80 percent in many plantations and yield losses of up to 90 percent have been reported.

The bacteria survive in soil and plant debris and are mainly spread via infected planting material, by insects, mechanical means, and contaminated tools. A range of alternate hosts may serve as pathogen reservoirs. An integrated approach is needed for disease management, including cultural methods (such as crop rotation), use of certified clean material for replanting, as well as phytosanitation to reduce inoculum and prevent re-introduction and plant-to-plant spread of the pathogen. However, these measures may be difficult to implement with smallholders, as mentioned in the item above.

BXW 1st appeared in Uganda in 2001 (ProMED-mail post 20020105.3162) and has been spreading in the region since then. According to the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), it is present in Ethiopia, Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, Tanzania, DR Congo, and Burundi. In Rwanda, it was 1st reported in 2007 from Gisenyi province.
