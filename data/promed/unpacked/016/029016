[Liberia will complete its 42-day countdown on 5 Sep 2015. The country had been declared Ebola-free by WHO on 9 May 2015, but identification of Ebola virus in the corpse of a 17-year-old boy 48 days later changed its status. After 5 Sep 2015, surveillance activities must remain a high priority for the country. - Mod.LK]

Ebola Situation Report - 2 Sep 2015
---------------------------------------

Summary
-------
There were 3 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) reported in the week to 30 Aug [2015]: 2 in Guinea and one in Sierra Leone. The case in Sierra Leone is the 1st in the country for over 2 weeks. Overall case incidence has remained stable at 3 confirmed cases per week for 5 consecutive weeks. In addition, the number of contacts under observation continues to fall, from approximately 600 on 23 Aug [2015] to approximately 450 on 30 Aug [2015]. Of those, over 400 are located in Guinea.

All 48 contacts under follow-up in Sierra Leone are associated with the most recently reported case from the western district of Kambia, which borders Guinea. A rapid-response team has been deployed to the area due to the likelihood of further localised transmission associated with the case. Both cases reported from Guinea this week had symptom onset in or near the capital, Conakry. One of the cases was symptomatic for an extended period in the community. There remains a risk of short-term increases in case incidence as a result of isolated, high-risk cases, and rapid-response teams are on alert to deal with any such cases.

The 2 confirmed cases reported from Guinea in the week to 30 Aug [2015] were identified in or near the Ratoma area of the capital, Conakry. The 1st case, a 9-month-old girl, was not a registered contact and had onset of symptoms on the outskirts of Conakry in Dubreka, before being taken to the Ratoma area of the capital by her family, where she died before she could be admitted to an Ebola treatment centre. The 2nd case is a 56-year-old male and registered contact of a case reported from Ratoma on 18 Aug [2015]. Of 410 contacts who were under follow-up on 30 Aug [2015] in Guinea, 289 were located in Conakry, with 26 in Dubreka and 95 in Forecariah. The previous week, 600 contacts were located in 4 western prefectures (Conakry, Coyah, Dubreka, and Forecariah).

No new cases were reported from Liberia in the week to 30 Aug [2015]. All contacts in Liberia have now completed their 21-day follow-up period. The last 2 patients with EVD in Liberia were discharged after completing treatment and testing negative for EVD for a 2nd time on 23 Jul [2015]. Surveillance continues to be strengthened, with approximately 800 samples tested for EVD in the week to 30 Aug [2015].

One new confirmed case was reported from Sierra Leone in the week to 30 Aug [2015], the 1st case reported from the country for over 2 weeks. The case was a woman approximately 60 years of age who was identified as EVD-positive after post-mortem testing. She had symptom onset in the village of Sella Kafta, Tonko Limba chiefdom in Kambia, and was treated in the community before her death. Kambia, which borders the Guinean prefecture of Forecariah, had not reported a confirmed case for 48 days. A rapid-response team was immediately deployed to the area. As of 30 Aug [2015], a total of 48 contacts had been identified, although this figure is expected to rise in due course. The origin of infection remains under investigation. The Phase 3 efficacy trial of the VSV-EBOV vaccine has now been extended from Guinea to Sierra Leone. Contacts and contacts of contacts associated with the confirmed case in Kambia will, therefore, be offered the vaccine. Contacts associated with all other chains of transmission in Sierra Leone have now completed follow-up.

No new health worker infections were reported in the week to 30 Aug [2015]. There have been a total of 881 confirmed health worker infections reported from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone since the start of the outbreak, with 513 reported deaths.

Countries with widespread and intense transmission
-----------------------------------
There have been a total of 28 073 reported confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone (figure 1, table 1) up to 30 Aug [2015], with 11 290 reported deaths (this total includes reported deaths among probable and suspected cases, although outcomes for many cases are unknown). Two new confirmed cases were reported in Guinea and one in Sierra Leone in the week to 30 Aug [2015].

The total number of confirmed cases is similar in males and females (table 2). Compared with children (people aged 14 years and under), adults aged 15 to 44 are approximately 4 times more likely to be affected in Guinea and Liberia and 3 times more likely to be affected in Sierra Leone.

No new health worker infections were reported in the week to 30 Aug [2015]. Since the start of the outbreak, a total of 881 confirmed health worker infections have been reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone; there have been 513 reported deaths (table 5).

[Because of the deplorable condition of the cemetery, the international NGO (non-governmental organization) Samaritan's Purse in collaboration with the Foya District National Traditional Council of Chiefs and Elders (NTCCE) have agreed to rehabilitate the Foya Ebola Cemetery on the outskirts of Foya City. The upgrade will include rebuilding of dilapidated graves, construction of a fence around the graveyard, and erection of a monument at the entrance with the names of those who fell to the virus inscribed on it. ...more]

31 Aug 2015 Sierra Leone: Experts hunt origin of new Ebola case in Sierra Leone
http://www.cbsnews.com/news/experts-hunt-origin-of-new-ebola-case-in-sierra-leone/
[According to Dr. Margaret Harris, a World Health Organization (WHO) spokesperson, Ebola experts are in Sierra Leone's Kambia district investigating a case that emerged less than a week after the country's last known patient was discharged from a hospital, a World Health Organization spokeswoman said on Mon [31 Aug 2015]. Once the source of transmission is found and contacts are traced, a vaccination trial will also begin in the northern Sierra Leone area, said Harris.

Samples from a 67-year-old woman's corpse tested positive for Ebola, WHO technical coordinator Margarette Lamunu said. The woman died and was safely buried on 29 Aug [2015] but had been treated at home in Kafta village. Therefore, more Ebola cases are expected, Lamunu said.

Authorities decided weeks ago to extend a vaccine trial from Guinea to Sierra Leone, Harris said. The trial for the VSV-EBOV -- developed by Canada and licensed to Merck -- is done where there are people infected with Ebola virus disease (EVD). Experts target contacts of the infected, and contacts of those contacts to create a buffer zone around a case to prevent its spread. Now that there is a case, and once contacts are traced, they will seek participants, and the trial will begin in the area, Harris said. ...more]

1 Sep 2015 Sierra Leone: Health workers rush to vaccinate Sierra Leoneans after new Ebola case
http://sputniknews.com/africa/20150901/1026416952.html#ixzz3kWO3fOZH
[A new case of the deadly Ebola virus disease in Sierra Leone has initiated the World Health Organization's plan to extend test drug vaccinations to Sierra Leone after it remained free from Ebola virus disease for almost 3 weeks. Health workers are preparing to conduct the so-called ring vaccination with an experimental VSV-EBOV vaccine, currently tested in Ebola-hit Guinea. The ring vaccination strategy involves inoculating the people who came into contact with the confirmed Ebola patient, as well as their contacts. ...more

Ring vaccination had already been planned in Sierra Leone. See Ebola update (101): WHO update, susp. NGO, vaccines, funding 20150826.3604518; 24 Aug 2015 Sierra Leone: Guinea extends Ebola ring vaccine trial to Sierra Leone (http://allafrica.com/stories/201508260939.html).

The Guinean Ebola ring vaccine trial has been extended to Sierra Leone as a move to stop transmission across the region. Five sites will be made available for the vaccine study, and expert trainers from the UK will do the training. ...more - Mod.LK]

1 Sep 2015 Sierra Leone: 50 people quarantined after new Ebola death in Sierra Leone
http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/50-people-quarantined-after-new-Ebola-death-in-S-Leone
[According to medical officials on Tue [1 Sep 2015], 50 people have been placed in quarantine in northern Sierra Leone after the death of a middle-aged woman from Ebola virus disease (EVD).

Ibrahim Sesay of the National Ebola Response Center (NERC) told a local radio station: "We are conducting an epidemiological investigation to trace the extent of the transmission."

The woman who died was sick for 5 to 10 days without the authorities being alerted. The woman had not traveled to either Liberia or Guinea, countries which either have ongoing EVD cases and/or have not yet been designated as Ebola-free. According to Sesay, because 50 people have been identified as high risk, there should be no surprise if there are additional cases related to the new case. ...more]

1 Sep 2015 Tanzania: Burundian refugee not killed by Ebola: Tanzanian gov't
http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-09/02/c_134577945.htm
[The government of Tanzania confirmed on Tue 1 Sep 2015 that a Burundian refugee, who was thought to have died of Ebola in Kigoma region on the shores of Lake Tanganyika, did not actually have the disease.

The deceased, aged 39, developed Ebola-like symptoms and died early last month [August 2015] at Maweni Regional Hospital in the region. His death sparked fears of an Ebola outbreak in the Nyarugusu refugee camp.

The East African nation's Ministry of Health and Social Welfare said samples of the deceased tested negative for the Ebola virus but did not rule out the actual disease that caused the death of the refugee. [The refugee] was earlier diagnosed with a viral hemorrhagic disease, according to experts who spoke to media when the incident was reported at the refugee camp in Kigoma. Nsachris Mwamwaja, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Health, said Ebola falls under this class of diseases, but samples of the man tested negative for Ebola. "If he had died of Ebola we would have announced already, and it would be a serious public health issue now," said Mwamwaja. ...more

31 Aug 2015: Emory Eye Center team makes 2nd trip to West Africa in "Quiet Eye" project
http://news.emory.edu/stories/2015/08/quiet_eye_project/campus.html
[This summer [2015], experts from the Emory Eye Center reached out to the West Coast of Africa to address an eye condition that was recently discovered at Emory. Uveitis specialist Steven Yeh, MD, graduate resident Jessica Shantha, oculoplastics specialist Brent Hayek, MD, and Ian Crozier, MD, an infectious disease physician and Ebola survivor, traveled to Sierra Leone to assist in the evaluation and treatment of ocular complications in Ebola virus disease survivors. An earlier trip to Monrovia, Liberia was the 1st outreach to this affected region.

Crozier was successfully treated for Ebola and the Ebola-related uveitis that developed after recovery at Emory. Surprisingly, live Ebola virus was found in his eye after his full recovery from Ebola. ...more]

Vaccines

2 Sep 2015: Ban on chimp testing puts wild ape vaccine for Ebola at risk
https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22730373-900-ban-on-chimp-testing-puts-wild-ape-vaccine-at-risk/
[An animal-welfare victory in the US may prove to be a conservation catastrophe in Africa. Tests of a promising oral Ebola vaccine that could protect wild apes may be abandoned this month [September 2015] when a ban on the use of chimpanzees in biomedical research comes into force.

An outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus has swept across West Africa over the past 17 months, killing more than 11 000 people. Humans are not the only great apes at risk. The virus has killed chimps elsewhere in Africa, and, according to estimates by Peter Walsh at the University of Cambridge, the virus has wiped out 1/3rd of the world's gorillas, leaving the western lowland gorilla critically endangered.

Infected ape carcasses have, in turn, triggered further human outbreaks in central Africa. Walsh thinks the virus is now spreading across central Africa towards previously unaffected gorillas.

But there is hope. Last year [2014], Walsh reported that an injectable vaccine made of viral fragments prompted chimps to produce antibodies at levels that protected vaccinated macaque monkeys from Ebola. For ethical reasons, chimps cannot be exposed to the virus to test vaccines. However, human trials of Ebola vaccines being carried out in West Africa mean researchers can now compare antibody levels in vaccinated chimps with those known to protect humans. ...more

This is an ironic twist. But if the vaccine can be administered in the wild, and antibody in vaccinated chimps can be measured, it seems to be worth undertaking to protect these endangered animals from Ebola virus disease. - Mod.LK]

[As Liberia prepares to be declared once again free of the Ebola virus later this week, unions and civil society groups are beginning to question how the government spent money allocated to fight the outbreak. Lamii Kpargoi, the head of civil society group Liberia Media Center, said his group has launched a project to account for how that money was spent. ...more]
