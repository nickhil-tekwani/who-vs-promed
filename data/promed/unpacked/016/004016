A deadly maize disease hits Mozambique
--------------------------------------
A devastating maize disease, prevalent in East Africa, is threatening the food security and livelihoods of millions of people in Mozambique.

Pedro Fato, Agriculture Research Centre in Maputo, says their team has identified the viral disease maize lethal necrosis (MLN) in the country's northern parts.

Ivan Rwomushana, Association for Strengthening Agricultural Research in Eastern and Central Africa (ASARECA), said, "I am not surprised that MLN has now found its way to Mozambique. We have done some ecological modeling that shows several Southern African countries were very likely to be affected." MLN is spread through seed and insect vectors, he said.

In 2012, MLN affected 26 000 hectares [64 247 acres] of maize in Kenya, which were valued at USD 23 million.

Fato advises farmers to use clean certified maize seeds.

[Maize lethal necrosis (MLN) is caused by co-infection of _Maize chlorotic mottle virus_ (MCMV, genus _Machlomovirus_), transmitted by chrysomelid beetle vectors, and either _Maize dwarf mosaic virus_ (MDMV, genus _Potyvirus_) or _Wheat streak mosaic virus_ (WSMV, genus _Tritimovirus_). MLN has been reported from the Americas and some locations in Europe. MLN as well as MCMV were reported for the 1st time in Africa from Kenya in 2012 (see link below).

WSMV has not been reported from Africa, but MDMV is known to occur in the region. MDMV is closely related to _Sugarcane mosaic virus_ (SCMV, genus _Potyvirus_), also present in the area, and both are transmitted by a number of aphid species. SCMV has been reported as the co-infecting potyvirus in Kenya, but transmission in maize seed was previously only reported for MDMV, and not SCMV. However, seed transmission of MLN in Africa is being claimed. This would imply that at least one of its viruses is seed transmitted, and that infected seedlings then acquire the 2nd virus from infectious insect vectors present locally. Thus, the 2 viruses involved in Africa may be MCMV, which is not seed transmitted, and either seed transmitted MDMV (undifferentiated from SCMV in the diagnosis) or a new strain of SCMV that can be seed transmitted in maize.

Symptoms of the individual viruses are synergistically enhanced in MLN and may include leaf mottling and necrosis, distortion of ears, absence of kernels, failure to produce tassels, as well as stunting, premature aging, and death of plants. Symptoms may disappear during the growing season leaving plants with latent infections but reduced yield as virus reservoirs and making disease monitoring difficult. Infectious vector insects may be carried by wind over long distances. Disease management may include crop rotation, certified clean seeds, control of vector species and weedy reservoir hosts, and use of crop cultivars or hybrids with reduced sensitivity to the viruses. A resistance breeding programme has been set up in Kenya screening a large set of diverse pre-commercial hybrids from CIMMYT and other public and private institutions.

MCMV has recently been detected in Rwanda, and the country is now on alert for MLN (see link below). MLN is suspected in South Sudan.
