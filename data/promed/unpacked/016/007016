At least one person has been confirmed dead following an outbreak of
a haemorrhagic viral infection (otherwise known as Lassa fever) in
Abakaliki, the Ebonyi State capital. Although unconfirmed, reports
claim that 3 other persons believed to be residing at the military
cantonment have also died of the disease. The Commissioner for Health
and Environment in the state, Dr. Sunday Nwangele, who confirmed the
outbreak of the disease, said, however, that the state Ministry of
Health is on top of the situation.

The disease was 1st reported in the state in 2008, which then claimed
the lives of some people, including 2 medical doctors and other health
workers.

The Nigerian Compass newspaper gathered that the victim of the recent
incident resided at the Military Cantonment, Nkwegu, near Abakaliki.
Another woman in the same cantonment, who has also been diagnosed with
the disease, is said to be receiving treatment at the Ebonyi State
University Teaching Hospital.

According to the commissioner, epidemiologists from the ministry have
been deployed to the affected area and other parts of the state to
check the possible spread of the disease. Nwangele said the ministry
has sent protective kits to the state's teaching hospital for the
safety of health personnel.

The Chief Medical Director of the teaching hospital, Dr. Akuma Aja,
narrated how the victims were brought to the health facility. He said
the hospital took samples from neighbours and relatives, who had close
contacts with them, as well as health personnel who attended to them
while on admission, stressing that some of the results tested positive
to the disease.

Aja advised people in the state to keep their environment clean and
avoid contact with rodents and rats, which have been identified to be
responsible for the transmission of the disease.

[Lassa haemorrhagic fever is an acute illness of 1-4 weeks duration
that occurs in West Africa. Though 1st described in the 1950s, the
virus causing the disease was not identified until 1969. The virus is
a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the virus family
_Arenaviridae_. Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Guinea, Liberia,
Sierra Leone and parts of Nigeria but probably exists in other West
African countries as well. About 80 percent of human infections are
asymptomatic; the remaining cases have severe multi-system disease,
where the virus affects several organs in the body, such as the liver,
spleen and kidneys. The incubation period of Lassa fever ranges from
6-21 days.

Lassa fever is a zoonotic disease. The animal reservoir of Lassa
virus is a rodent of the genus _Mastomys_, commonly known as the
"multimammate rat." _Mastomys_ infected with Lassa virus do not become
ill, but they can shed the virus in their urine and faeces. (An image
of a multimammate rat can be viewed at:
<http://www15.bni-hamburg.de/bni/bni2/neu2/getfile.acgi?area=forschunggruppen&pid=21232>).

Lassa fever can affect all age groups. Persons at greatest risk are
those living in rural areas where _Mastomys_ are usually found,
especially in areas of poor sanitation or crowded living conditions
such as, in the present instance, military encampments. There is no
epidemiological evidence supporting airborne spread between humans,
but person-to-person transmission occurs in both community and health
care settings.

Lassa virus was named after the town of Lassa in northeastern
Nigeria, where the 1st known patient contracted this infection in
1969. Lassa viral infection may affect between 2 to 3 million people
each year in certain portions of the West African region, causing a
mortality of about 10 000. Lassa fever is one of the endemic zoonoses
in Nigeria, with a high probability for nosocomial transmission due to
several health care sector challenges. Although treatment is available
for Lassa fever, early diagnosis is still difficult in almost all
Nigerian health care institutions. (For a recent review, see, V.
Idemyor, Lassa virus infection in Nigeria: clinical perspective
overview. J Natl Med Assoc 102(12):1243-6, 2010).
