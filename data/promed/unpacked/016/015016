First Report of Broad bean wilt virus 1 in Spain

publication 29 March 2002.
In late summer 2001, field-grown pepper (_Capsicum annuum_) ... showing
chlorotic blotching in leaves and fruits were observed in Benicarl贸,
Castell贸n, Spain. [Enzyme linked immunosorbent] assays of extracts of these
plants with a collection of plant virus antisera showed a positive reaction
only with broad bean wilt [faba]virus serotype 1 (BBWV-1) antiserum.
To confirm BBWV-1 infection, primers B1 (GCTCTTCCCCATATAACTTTC) and B2
(GTCTCTATCTTCTCTTCTTCC) were designed based on the nucleotide sequence of
BBWV-1 isolate PV132 (GenBank Accession No. AB018702), and were used for
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ... analysis.
RNAs extracted from symptomatic plants yielded a cDNA product of ca. 500 bp
that was not obtained using RNA extracts from healthy plants. The sequence
of this cDNA fragment was determined, and it showed about 80 [per cent]
nucleotide identity with a BBWV-1 genomic region, encompassing part of the
two coat proteins genes. Amino acid identities were about 94 [per cent]
with BBWV-1 isolates and about 60 [per cent] with BBWV-2 isolates.
BBWV-1 and BBWV-2 are considered different species [by the International
Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses]. ... [They] are distributed worldwide
and infect a wide range of plants. In the Mediterranean Basin, BBWV-1 has
been serologically identified in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, Tunisia,
Morocco (2), and Italy (1), but no nucleotide sequence data are available.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of BBWV-1 in Spain.

[The 2 viruses are considered to be distinct species on the basis that
pseudorecombination between them is impossible and there are differences in
antigenic reactions. Unfortunately, I could not find a description of
BBWV-2, hence my comments pertain to BBWV-1. That virus is transmitted in a
non-persistent manner by several aphids (_Acyrthosiphon pisum_, _Aphis
craccivora_, _A. faba_, _A. nasturtii_, _Macrosiphum euphorbiae_, _M.
solanifolii_ and _M. persicae_; in the family Aphididae). It is also
transmitted by mechanical inoculation but not by seed. BBWV-1 is reported
to be spreading in several regions (Africa, Eurasia, Middle East, North
America, and the Pacific) and in Australia and China. It has also been
found, but with no evidence of spread, in Argentina. - Mod.DH]
