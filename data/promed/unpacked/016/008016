In Himachal Pradesh, 76 people were killed by scrub typhus, jaundice, and swine flu this year [2016] -- 37 by scrub typhus, 34 by jaundice, and 5 by swine flu [H1N1].

Data compiled by the health and family welfare department until 11 Nov [2016] has revealed that in the state, 1158 people have tested positive for scrub typhus, 9265 for jaundice, and 14 for swine flu.

With the start of winter, swine flu cases are likely to rise in the coming months. Last year [2015], the state had registered 123 positive cases of swine flu -- the highest so far -- out of which 27 died.

After receiving a detailed report on scrub typhus cases, Union health minister JP Nadda in September [2016] had assured all support to Himachal Pradesh.
