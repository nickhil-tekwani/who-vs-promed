The amount of whooping cough cases in Daviess County has already doubled from last year's numbers [2017]. "We usually only have one to 2 cases a year," Daviess County public health nurse Kathy Sullender said. "This year [2018] we have already had 4 cases. Three of the 4 cases had not received a vaccination," Sullender said. "The one that was vaccinated had a very mild case."

For questions about any vaccine or to schedule shots, call the Daviess County Health Department at 812-254-8666.

Reports of pertussis (also known as whooping cough) are on the rise in Ada and Canyon counties. Over the past 4 months, 89 cases have been reported -- 70 of those cases include Ada County residents, while 19 are Canyon County residents.

Whooping cough cases tend to peak every 3 to 5 years. The last peak was in 2014-2015, when nearly 300 cases of whooping cough were reported in Ada and Canyon counties. "The latest cycle of whooping cough began hitting Ada County back in October of last year [2017], while Canyon County cases began increasing in January of this year [2018]," Myron said [Christine Myron with the Central District Health Department in Boise].

A 2 month old boy died of pertussis in Armenia's Nork infectious clinical hospital. The child, just as 2 other children in the family, was not vaccinated because of parents' refusal, the Armenian health ministry said in a statement.

The illness started 2 months ago, but parents rejected hospitalization despite doctor's instructions. The laboratory tests revealed that twins -- boys 2 months old -- were infected by their 2 year old sister.

More cases of pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, have been recorded in Armenia over the recent 2 months. There are already 12 laboratory confirmed cases this year [2018] compared with 3 in the same period last year [2017]. Eight of 12 affected children were not vaccinated or were partially vaccinated. The disease mainly affects children under one [year of age].

The Armenian health ministry recalled that vaccination is the only efficient and safe prevention for pertussis.

Noosa children are in the firing line of a severe whooping cough outbreak more than double the intensity of previous years, as council and health experts urge parents to vaccinate. "So far this year [2018], there have been 37 cases of whooping cough notified to Queensland Health for residents of the Noosa Council area," Noosa Council's environmental health coordinator Geoff Atherfold said. "Most of these cases have been children. In past years there have been up to 12 whooping cough notifications for a similar period," he said.

The council is supporting Queensland Health experts' warning for residents to stay vigilant and vaccinate. "The target to prevent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease is 95 per cent," Mr Artherfold said. "In the Noosa Shire area we are short of the target with 89 per cent of one year old children vaccinated, so we encourage all parents to ensure that their children are vaccinated," he said. "This is for both the safety of their own children but also for the safety of other children they come into contact with."

Mr Artherfold said whooping cough is a highly contagious respiratory infection that can cause serious, and sometime life-threatening, health issues, particularly in babies. "We all have a responsibility to help prevent an outbreak." Free vaccinations are available for women in their 3rd trimester of pregnancy and for babies at 2, 4 and 6 months of age with booster doses for children at 18 months, 4 years, and during their 1st year of high school. Adults are advised that they can also obtain boosters to ensure that they are protected and in doing so they are helping to protect others. The vaccine for whooping cough is combined with that for diphtheria and tetanus and is available from all general practitioners.

A total of 5 people in the Bay of Plenty have been hospitalised with whooping cough this year[2018] amid a national epidemic. This compares with 12 hospitalisations recorded for the whole of 2017, 6 of which were in Western Bay.

Toi Te Ora Public Health has also been notified of 98 Bay of Plenty cases of whooping cough in 2018. There were a total of 129 cases notified in 2017. "We do have an epidemic and I think that's the 1st and most important thing - that everyone is aware," Bay of Plenty medical officer of health Dr Neil de Wet said.

Nationally, 2140 cases of whooping cough were notified in 2017 and 876 so far this year [2018]. Since November 2017, across the Bay of Plenty and Lakes districts, 231 cases have been notified.

Dr Symon Roberton, director of Papamoa Pines Medical Centre, said he was seeing increasing numbers of whooping cough cases at his centre during this significant outbreak. There had been about 40 confirmed cases at Papamoa Pines since December 1 last year [2017], the GP said, and probably another 40-50 who were diagnosed clinically but did not require further investigation as they presented well after treatment times or during their infectious periods. "This is one of the problems with the disease in that the early symptoms are much like a cold or viral illness and why prevention via immunisation is so important. Treatment does not help symptoms but limits the infectious period.
