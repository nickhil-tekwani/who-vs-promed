Re: Measles virus, outbreak of H1 genotype - Japan
--------------------------------------------------
Your recent report entitled "Measles virus, outbreak of H1 genotype -
Japan" contained a summary of an article from the Manichi Daily News titled
"New Measles Strain Strikes High School Students." The article states that
among the people afflicted were people who had been immunized against
measles. Leading authorities on measles in the United States say the
Japanese experience does not represent a more dangerous strain of measles
or waning protection from vaccine.
A more likely explanation is failure to immunize universally with measles
vaccine and to employ a 2- dose schedule. The second dose is necessary to
protect the approximately 5 percent of children who fail to seroconvert
with the first dose of measles vaccine.

[There has been some correspondence on this report, and Dr. Cooper's
comment allows us to clarify the situation. In an off-line comment to
another subscriber I wrote the following: "It is important to distinguish
genetic variability (the lineages/clades) from antigenic variability. There
is no clear evidence to indicate that the current live vaccine fails to
protect against viruses of any of the 8 different clades at the level of
the individual. Where there is less than optimal uptake of vaccine, measles
will continue to spread, and any imported virus may spread for reasons
other than antigenic variation. The outbreaks that occurred in the US after
eradication of indigenous measles proved to be due to imported virus, which
revealed lapses in vaccine coverage and were contained by re-vaccination to
increase coverage rather than to stimulate immune responses in individuals.
I believe that there was also some revaccination carried out in the US
because of doubts about the potency of some vaccine lots." My fellow
moderators have provided the following additional comments. - Mod.CP
In the CDC pink book chapter on measles, pages 9/10 mention the following:
"Although the titer of vaccine-induced antibodies is lower than that
following natural disease, both serologic and epidemiologic evidence
indicate that vaccine-induced immunity appears to be long-term and probably
life-long in most individuals. Most vaccinated persons who appear to lose
antibody show an anamnestic immune response upon revaccination indicating
that they are probably still immune. Although revaccination can increase
antibody titer in some persons, available data indicate that the increased
titer may not be sustained. Some studies indicate that secondary vaccine
failure (waning immunity) may occur after successful vaccination, but this
appears to occur very rarely and to only play a minor role in measles
transmission and outbreaks."

[Historically, a recommendation for a second dose of measles vaccine for
all those who were immunized prior to 1968 was made because of uncertainty
on the potency of the vaccine available during the period 1963-1967, and
the observation of cases of "atypical measles" in those that had been
vaccinated with the earlier vaccine. In addition, vaccine failures related
to vaccine administration to children before age 1 were noted as well. See
Paunio M, Hedman K, Davidkin I, Valle M, Heinonen OP, Leinikki P, Salmi A,
Peltola H. Secondary measles vaccine failures identified by measurement of
IgG avidity: high occurrence among teenagers vaccinated at a young age.
