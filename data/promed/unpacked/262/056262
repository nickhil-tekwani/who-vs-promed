Dear Colleagues,

I have the honor to inform you that our epidemiologic surveillance
system has detected a case of laboratory confirmed polio; serotyping
is underway. The details of the viral strain will be sent later by a
laboratory in Johannesburg. Otherwise, the measures mentioned are
those implemented in the context of rapid response.

To get an idea about the case and the measures put in place [below
is] a detailed investigation and response.

However, it is requested that all clinicians raise their level of
vigilance to take into account the clinical forms of atypical polio.

The surveillance has certainly proved its effectiveness. It is now
necessary to review the immunization strategy completely. I am
currently working on revising the plan of action to fight against
polio and also the installation of border post sentries in the form
of quarantine offices. I subsequently communicate these documents to
serve as a guide in countries with limited resources.

Report on the investigation and response to an imported case of polio
in Djibouti:
-----------------------------------------------
The child, [a 24-month-old], from Harrouah Ethiopia, came with his
mother to Djibouti on 19 Jun 2008 and stayed with relatives in the
town of Warableh in the Commune of Balbala in Djibouti city. On [24
Jun 2008], she consulted the Hayableh [health] center due to [the
child's] inability to walk.

Physical examination revealed an acute flaccid paralysis [AFP]. On
interview, it was found that the child was not well in the period
preceding her arrival in Djibouti. Four days prior to the onset of
paralysis, the child had presented with fever, diarrhea and vomiting.

The case was declared [reported] on the same day to the surveillance
and epidemiological investigations unit, and investigations were made
within 24 hours following the declaration [report].

The girl returned to Ethiopia 2 weeks later.

Samples were sent to the Polio [reference] Laboratory in Nairobi on 3
Aug 2008. On [25 Aug 2008], the Department of Polio Eradication, WHO
Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean, informed us by mail of
the presence of a polio virus in stool samples from this child, and
the sample was sent to the Reference Laboratory in South Africa.

Given this situation, the Ministry of Health has set up a committee
to respond to imported cases of polio. The plan established by the
Committee is as follows:

- Conduct a vaccination campaign around the house where the girl
stayed on 30 and 31 Aug 2008.
- Take at least 5 samples in the vicinity of the house of the
parents of the girl.
- Strengthen active surveillance and the search for AFP cases.
- In the same context, a vaccination campaign was conducted at the
camp with displaced families from Ethiopia near the localities of
Sankal and Bondara.
- Carry out AFP detection [activities] and administration of an
extra dose of OPV [oral polio vaccine] to all children entering
Djibouti at border posts beginning on 1 Sep 2008.

1) The response campaign:
- Was organized within a radius of 300 meters from the house where
the girl stayed.
- Eight teams took part in this campaign for 2 days.
- The number of families visited was 354; the number of children
under 5 years [identified] and vaccinated were 656, including 550
that were fully immunized (83.8 percent).
- During the campaign, 4 stool samples were obtained.

2) The strengthening of active surveillance:
- A memo was sent to districts to double surveillance [routine?] and
strengthen active surveillance.

3) The response in the villages of Sankal and Bondorra:
- The mobile team of Dikhil led this campaign. On the other hand,
the national focal point PFA visited localities in search of AFP
cases and to check whether the campaign was conducted properly.

The following table summarizes the number of children vaccinated:

Locality / Origin / Sites visited / Infants vaccinated / Infants
completely vaccinated
Sankal / Villager / 10 / 16 / 17
Sankal / Refugee / 77 / 181 / 3
Bondora / Villager / 22 / 37 / 7
Bondora / Refugee / 17 / 43 / 0

Total / / 126 / 307 / 27

4) Control and vaccination of children in border centers:
- A note was sent to doctors and heads of districts to implement
vaccine supply, training of agents and data collection.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Ammar Abdo Ahmed for sharing
this excellent report on the investigation and control measures
implemented in Djibouti, responding to a recently identified imported
case of polio in Djibouti from Ethiopia. From the date of onset of
illness and the date of travel of the case from Ethiopia to Djibouti,
it is fairly clear that the case was infected with the poliovirus
while in Ethiopia.

According to the most recent information available on the polio
eradication website, as of 3 Sep 2008, there have been a total of 2
confirmed cases of polio attributable to wild poliovirus (WPV)
infection in Ethiopia since the beginning of 2008, with the date of
onset of the most recent case 27 Apr 2008 (see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp>).

The summary report on polio activity in the Horn of Africa mentions
the following:
* No new cases were reported in the past week. The total number of
cases in the region remains 5 (4 in the southern Sudan/western
Ethiopia cross-border area, and one in West Darfur, Sudan). The most
recent case had onset of paralysis on [6 Jul 2008] (WPV3 from West
Darfur, Sudan).
* Immunization activities took place last week in northern Sudan
(including the Darfurs), using tOPV (trivalent OPV). Further
activities in Sudan are tentatively planned for [27 Oct 2008 and 24
Nov 2008].

This report does not contain information on the above mentioned case
imported from Ethiopia to Djibouti.

As the date of onset of paralysis of this case was in early August
2008, while no cases have been reported from Ethiopia since the case
with date of onset of disease in late April 2008, one can assume
there is still WPV circulation in Ethiopia as of August 2008. The
absence of reports of cases in this interval can represent
deficiencies in surveillance or low level circulation with resulting
non-paralytic infections (remembering that on average, for every 200
individuals that are infected with poliovirus, only one will have
paralytic disease, but the range of paralytic to non-paralytic can
vary from a high of one in 50 infections to a low of one in 1000
infections.

mentioned areas of Sankal and Bondora.
