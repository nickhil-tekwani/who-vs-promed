LONDON - A sharp rise in the death toll from the human form of "mad cow"
disease is being investigated by British government scientific advisers,
with 67 people in Britain now thought to have been poisoned by infected
beef. The number of deaths from new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(nvCJD), the human equivalent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), is
up 25 from last year, although comparisons are difficult because of changes
in the way the inevitably fatal condition is diagnosed and confirmed. Also
next week, the government's food standards agency will continue its review
on whether it would be safe to reduce some anti-mad-cow controls introduced
over the past 12 years but widely flouted. Confidence was recently dented
by the announcement a cow born after extra controls were introduced in
March 1996 had contracted mad-cow disease. The malady had in the past few
years been killing only older dairy cows that had not been culled as they
were not destined for food.

Dr. Philip Monk, the county consultant in communicable disease, leading the
investigation into the Leicestershire cluster of deaths from the human form
of BSE, new variant CJD (nvCJD), emphatically denied the clustered outbreak
was linked to infected baby food or school dinners. Dr Robert Will,
director of the CJD surveillance unit in Edinburgh, said one explanation
for the disease among the young could be the amount of mechanically
extracted meat in children and babies' food in the 1980s. Such meat, widely
used in baby foods and common in school meals, was also used for cheap
products such as sausages, pies, burgers and ready-cooked meals. After
investigating the cases in Leicestershire for three weeks, Dr Monk is
convinced the answer will be a different one.

British government scientists said the incidence of the deadly human form
of BSE in Britain was increasing by a statistically significant" 20 to 30
percent a year. The Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC),
set up by the government to monitor the brain-wasting disease, said however
that it was too early to assess the long-term trend on new variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (nvCJD).
"There are now 76 definite and probable cases, including 7 probables still
alive," the committee said in a statement. "The number of cases reported
now indicated a statistically significant rising trend of about 20 percent
to 30 percent per annum." Last month the government launched an urgent
inquiry into a cluster of CJD deaths around the small village of
Queniborough in the central English county of Leicestershire. Three of the
4 victims died within weeks of each other and all lived within a close
radius. Two of those who died were teenagers.
The Health Department has ordered tests of more than 10,000 tonsils and
appendixes removed since 1985 to find out how many people in Leicestershire
have contracted the disease. A Department spokeswoman said last Friday an
investigation would probably take months but could provide vital
information on the disease.

UK GOVERNMENT: Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) press
release following meeting of 17 Jul 2000 The Spongiform Encephalopathy
Advisory Committee (SEAC) met at the offices of the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Whitehall Place West, London. A full
summary of the Committee's deliberations will be made available on 1 Aug.
In the meantime, the Committee has issued the following statement.
The Committee also noted 4 "definite" and 1 "probable" case of nvCJD had
occurred in an area of Leicestershire. The higher number of cases in that
area is unlikely to have occurred by chance but this cannot be completely
ruled out. The Committee welcomed the fact a locally based investigation
was now underway to look into the circumstances of this apparent cluster,
as this could well throw new light on the mode of transmission of nvCJD,
which would also have implications for understanding of the national
epidemic. The Committee noted the local investigation was likely to report
within the next few months, and asked to be kept closely informed of
developments.

Subject: Scrapies BSE connection
Source: Reuters Online, 19 Jul 2000 [edited

Tests on genetically engineered mice suggest "mad cow" disease almost
certainly spread to cows from sheep, a leading expert on the brain-wasting
condition said Wednesday. Stanley Prusiner of the University of California,
San Francisco, said mice whose genes had been engineered to mimic cows were
highly susceptible in repeated tests to sheep scrapie, a disease related to
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or mad cow disease).
Prusiner, on a visit to Britain to attend a biochemistry and molecular
biology conference, said he and colleagues had found the mice were actually
more susceptible to sheep prions -- microscopic disease-causing agents
--than to cow prions. "This provides the first good experimental data BSE
really originated in the sheep... It's extremely likely the prions in sheep
with scrapie are the cause of BSE," he said in a telephone interview.
Prusiner won a Nobel Prize in 1998 for his theories that BSE and related
diseases were caused by prions, which unlike bacteria and viruses, are
extremely hard to destroy by cooking or with chemicals. Scientists have
long speculated BSE may have jumped the "species barrier" from sheep to
cows but no conclusive evidence has yet been produced and Prusiner said
more work was needed to prove the hypothesis.
BSE -- whose human form, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (nvCJD), has
already caused dozens of deaths in Britain -- may be caused by one of
several prions carried by sheep, he said. In normal conditions, the BSE
prion in sheep is harmless because it is overwhelmed by other more dominant
strains, he suggested. But the dangerous version may have come to dominate
during the rendering and heating processes carried out in the 1980s when
now-banned animal-to-animal feeding regimes were practised.
"For 25 years people have tried to connect sheep prions with CJD but were
unable to do so. Now it looks as if there may be 3, 4 or 5 strains of
prions in sheep, one of them the BSE strain which the rendering process
selected for," he said.
Britain has recorded 76 definite and probable cases of nvCJD, the human
version of BSE, since the bovine disease swept through herds in the 1980s.
CJD is normally seen only in one in a million people.

Source: Reuters Health, 21 Jul 2000 [edited

Plans are being drawn up in Britain to breed sheep resistant to both bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and scrapie, a senior scientist on the
committee advising the government on new-variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(nvCJD) said. Dr. Peter Smith, acting chairman of the Spongiform
Encephalopathy AdvisoryCommittee (SEAC), said a consultation document on
the plans had been drawn up and would be issued to farmers and other
interested parties.
"We do know there are sheep with particular genes appearing to be
completely resistant to BSE and scrapie. There is a long-term plan to breed
them," he said in a telephone interview.
Scrapie in sheep and BSE in cattle ("mad cow disease") are variants of
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE). Although there is no
evidence BSE has infected the British sheep flock, the SEAC has asked the
government for an assessment of the public health consequences of finding
BSE in sheep.
"There is the possibility BSE will be found in sheep, but it is only a
possibility," stressed Dr. Smith, of the London School of Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine. The existing controls to stop contaminated animal feeds
from being given to cattle would also work in sheep, Dr. Smith said,
although he added the worry is if BSE behaves like scrapie, the disease
could be spread horizontally from sheep to sheep. Earlier this week, a
report from the Food Standards Agency warned "experimental studies of BSE
in sheep show the agent is widely distributed in lymphoid tissue early in
the incubation period. Some of the infected tissues are not covered by the
existing UK or future EU controls."
The report suggested "apparent inconsistencies" in the ovine and bovine
lists of specified risk materials, pointing out sheep's intestines are not
listed. It said sheep small intestines are used for the production of
sausage casings and it is "unlikely" any infectivity would be removed
during processing.
"It is not an inconsistency. We are aware the measures we have recommended
are for risk reduction, not risk elimination. This is because we are not
aware BSE is in sheep," Dr. Smith said.

Source: Associated Press, 3 Aug 2000 [edited

The number of people contracting the human form of BSE has increased by
about 23 percent a year in Britain since 1994, new research has found. The
findings, published this week in The Lancet medical journal, are part of
scientists' effort to determine the scope of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease (nvCJD), a fatal brain-wasting disease. They are struggling to make
accurate predictions about how large the epidemic will be or when it will
reach its peak because they don't know the incubation period of the
disease. It could lay dormant for 20 years without being detected.
The disease, which experts think comes from eating beef contaminated with
the cattle ailment bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), can only be
confirmed by examining the brains of victims after they have died. The
scientists have had to establish the onset of the infection by asking the
victims' relatives when symptoms first occurred. Experts don't know exactly
how long it takes between becoming infected and getting symptoms, and the
lag between becoming sick and dying has varied.
The study, by scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical
Medicine and the National CJD Surveillance Unit, also found deaths from
nvCJD have risen by about a third each year since 1994, slightly faster
than the increase in the onset of the disease. Researchers don't know why
deaths are rising faster than the incidence. As of 30 Jun 2000, a total of
75 confirmed or suspected cases have been documented. 69 of those people
have died. The research said 14 people have died of the disease in the
first 6 months of this year, compared with 18 deaths for the whole of 1998.
"Although absolute numbers remain low, there appears to be a real increase
in the incidence ... in the U.K., which is a cause for concern," said Dr.
Hester Ward of the surveillance unit, based in Edinburgh, Scotland. "Until
it is known whether this increasing trend is maintained over time, it is
difficult to predict future numbers of cases," she said.
The disease first surfaced in the mid-1990s, a decade after a veterinarian
discovered Britain's first BSE-infected cattle herd. Since the British
outbreak, which affected some 180 000 cattle, about 200 cases have been
found in Portugal and smaller numbers in Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, France, Denmark and Switzerland. A European Union report
concluded Tuesday that cases of mad cow disease are unlikely to occur in
the United States and Canada, but cannot be ruled out. Last month, U.S.
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman ordered the slaughter of 376 sheep
originating from Belgium on suspicion they may have a mad cow-type disease.

Suspected case of BSE reported in Norway
----------------------------------------
Norwegian health authorities suspect a bull imported from Denmark may be
infected with BSE ("mad cow disease"). According to the newspaper
Aftenposten, meat from the animal is not on the market and cattle from the
farm involved have been isolated. Tests from the bull's brain tissue will
apparently be sent to an international reference laboratory with results
expected in 2 weeks.
