The enterovirus which affected 7 out of a group of 17 young scouts from
Italy travelling to West Bengal, India, causing meningitis [see ProMED-mail
post of 6 Sep 2006, entitled: "Meningitis, enterovirus - Italy (Piemonte)
ex India 20060909.2563"] has been isolated from the stools of 6 of them and
has been identified as an echovirus. Typing was done with a pool of
antisera (Chemicon, IFA), including subtypes 4, 6, 9, 11, 30, and 34;
subtyping is in progress.
All patients recovered with no sequelae, and were discharged after 4-8 days
of treatment in hospital.

[ProMED-mail thanks Drs Caramello and Calleri for providing this
confirmation that 6 of the 7 meningitis patients had contracted echovirus
infection during travel in west Bengal. These data, together with the data
reported in Meningitis - Latvia (Rezekne & Daugavpi (02) 20061005.2850
identify echoviruses, 6, 9, 20 and 30 as the most likely cause of
meningitis in children and young adults in both Europe and Asia.
Information on the outcome of the subtyping of the echoviruses contracted
in Asia would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
