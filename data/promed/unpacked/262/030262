Singapore's hospitals are having to postpone some non-urgent surgeries as
they struggle to cope with an influx of dengue patients, officials said on
Thursday. Singapore has reported 8854 cases of dengue fever [so far in
2005] -- nearly double the number from the same period of 2004, when cases
on the island rocketed to a 10-year high. The disease has claimed 8 lives
[a case fatality rate of 904 per 100 000] since the start of 2005.
"We have postponed or cancelled 114 non-urgent procedures to meet the
demand of in-patient beds," a spokeswoman for Changi General Hospital told
Reuters. Another public hospital, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, will also delay
its non-urgent operations to cope with the burgeoning dengue cases. TTSH,
where most dengue patients are admitted, has about 90 to 110 dengue
patients staying in its wards each day. Dengue patients now account for
about 10 per cent of the hospital's total patient population.
Although a raft of measures has been introduced to eliminate mosquito
breeding sites, dengue infections have continued to increase -- prompting
the government to call for public efforts to halt the spread of the disease.
The health ministry said there were 546 new dengue cases reported in the
week ending 4 Sep 2005, rising from the 493 cases a week earlier and 414
from 2 weeks ago.
Dengue is carried by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, which transmits the
virus that causes the fever. The virus can cause fever, severe headache,
joint and muscular pains, vomiting and rashes.
Dengue has become a major international public health concern. The World
Health Organization issued an alert in September 2004 after a resurgence of
cases in the region. Singapore's neighbors, Malaysia, Indonesia and the
Philippines, are also struggling to control the disease, for which there is
no commercially ready vaccine.

Dengue fever is at epidemic levels in Costa Rica, with more than 19 000
reported cases so far in 2005 but with only one death to date, health
officials said on Wednesday. The small Central American nation is on track
to break the record 19 703 cases from 2 years ago, according to Teresita
Solano, head of the health ministry's dengue program.
"We can call this an epidemic," said Solano, adding that hospital services
are being stretched from the outbreak of dengue, which is carried by
mosquitoes and causes high fever and headache. If untreated, it can lead to
death.
In the town of Heredia, east of the Costa Rican capital, doctors at one
hospital ordered additional beds set up in the hospital's chapel to
accommodate dengue patients, said Francisco Cubillo, vice minister of health.
Officials blamed one death in the Pacific coast town of Puntarenas on
hemorrhagic dengue, which occurs when a previously infected person is
exposed to a 2nd form of the dengue virus. 30 cases of hemorrhagic dengue
have been reported in Costa Rica so far in 2005, Solano said.
Dengue was unknown in Costa Rica until 1993 when mosquitoes carrying the
fever migrated from neighboring countries. Officials suspect that climatic
and environmental changes, such as deforestation, have contributed to the
spread of the fever.

6 new cases of dengue were reported in the past 24 hours in [New Delhi],
taking the total number of cases to 70, health officials said Tuesday.
Of the total, 51 cases were from Delhi, while the remaining 19 were from
neighboring states. So far 3 people have succumbed to the disease, of whom
one is from Delhi and one each from Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh.
According to a Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) statement, the
situation is under control and steps are being taken to control the
disease's spread. "We have hired 1055 extra workers to help our regular
2500 health workers to search the houses where mosquito breeding is taking
place," said an MCD spokesperson.
The authorities also said they are constantly in touch with the Residents
Welfare Associations (RWA) to spread awareness in colonies. Posters and
pamphlets are also distributed in all parts of the capital.
West and south Delhi areas have been the worst hit, as mosquito breeding
has been the highest in those parts. Health workers have searched more than
34 700 houses in west Delhi, whereas 31 215 houses have been checked in
south Delhi to control mosquito breeding.

Dengue, the mosquito-transmitted lethal disease that has claimed 15 lives
and afflicted 1000 people in West Bengal so far [in 2005], has been
declared an epidemic by the state government.
State health director Prabhakar Chatterjee on Tuesday told IANS: "We have
reports of 15 deaths across West Bengal and it can be called an epidemic now."
West Bengal Health Minister Surya Kanta Mishra had on Monday officially
made a statement on the disease because of the above-normal number of cases
this year. Mishra had said that other than dengue, malaria, typhoid, viral
fever and encephalitis were also afflicting people, especially in Kolkata
[Calcutta].
"Of the blood samples that have been sent for testing, about 40 per cent
have turned out to be positive for dengue," Mishra said on Monday.
In many cases, clinical diagnosis of the disease had become difficult as
most of these diseases have similar symptoms. "We have reasons to be
concerned about the situation and have to be extremely careful in handling
it. But we are on the alert," the minister said.
The situation is worst in Kolkata and the satellite township of Salt Lake,
where official figures state that 540 dengue cases have been detected.
A large number of cases have been reported also from both south and north
Bengal districts of North 24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas, Hooghly, Howrah,
Burdwan, Birbhum, Malda, South Dinajpur, and Murshidabad. Almost every city
hospital is handling patients complaining of fever and "dengue-like symptoms".
Hospital authorities said they do not have the antigen kits to test dengue,
and all patients are being directed to the School of Tropical Medicine.
"There were sporadic cases every year but it appears to have peaked this
year," Mishra said.
Indian Medical Association joint secretary RD Dubey said the government
could have nipped the problem in the bud had it acted earlier by destroying
the breeding ground of mosquitoes.
Earlier, the Calcutta High Court had ordered the West Bengal government and
the Kolkata corporation to file a report on what extra steps they have
taken to combat dengue.
Unsatisfied with the explanation of the state government and the Kolkata
Municipal Corporation (KMC), a division bench of Chief Justice VS Sirpurkar
and Justice AK Ganguly, while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL),
has asked the authorities to gear up with their initiatives and file a
report to the court soon.
In the city, there are several big and small housing projects with open
reservoirs constructed for construction and also water accumulating in road
excavation sites, which are ideal sites for the killer mosquito that
[spreads the dengue virus].

A day after chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee admitted that the spread
of dengue in the State had reached epidemic proportions, Newsline
investigations revealed that doctors at the School of Tropical Medicine
(STM) -- one of the centres where the tests for detection of the dengue
virus are being conducted -- are distributing pamphlets which deny that the
virus was a killer.
"Do not spread rumours. There is no reason to create panic about dengue,"
declares the pamphlet. It adds that there is no possibility of being killed
by the ordinary dengue virus. The director of STM was unavailable for comment.
Meanwhile, according to the daily report submitted to the CM by the Health
Secretary, there have been 925 cases of dengue in the State so far. Of
these, 581 have been reported from within Kolkata [Calcutta]. The death
toll from the disease is now 15 in the State.
The reports of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) state that in the
Kolkata municipal area alone there have been more than 600 cases, with 7
deaths reported.
Buddhadeb said the KMC Health Department was trying to tackle the spread of
dengue. "I am satisfied with the efforts made by the KMC and the hospitals.
As far as the question of asking of assistance from the Union Government is
concerned, the Institute of Virology and the National Institute for Cholera
and Enteric Diseases (NICED) are already working with us," he said.
Meanwhile, patients must wait for at least 4 days before getting a dengue
test done. "The tests are an indirect method of detecting the dengue virus.
After the virus enters the body, it takes about 4-5 days for the
dengue-specific antibody -- Immuno globulin Muschen (IgM) -- to form. It is
this IgM that is detected. So the patient must allow his body the time to
develop this IgM," informed Dr Shyamalendu Chatterjee, who is heading the
NICED team.
STM doctors added: "It is important that the patient takes no antibiotics
[ineffective], since antibiotics induce antibodies in the body [not
proven?]. For dengue detection, it is extremely important that the body is
allowed to naturally develop the dengue specific antibody."

The Ministry of Health says that it has identified a probable case of
dengue hemorrhagic fever in the Cayo District. The diagnosis of the case,
which is described as mild, was made following examination of blood samples
sent to a lab in Mexico. A press release says that the patient had
travelled outside the country 2 weeks prior to the onset of his symptoms to
an area where the disease is endemic. The ministry continues to urge all
Belizeans to take measures to clean their yards and drain areas where
mosquitoes, the carriers of dengue, can breed.

[Cayo is the largest of the 6 districts that make up Belize. Geographically
the largest and most fertile district in Belize, Cayo spans more than 2000
square miles across diverse terrain -- from rolling hills and sweeping
farmland devoted to citrus orchards and cattle farming, to lush river
valleys and rugged mountain ridges covered in sub-tropical jungle. See
