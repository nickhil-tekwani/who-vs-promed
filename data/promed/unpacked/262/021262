>From Calcasieu Parish Mosquito Control:
In Calcasieu Parish, the 3 days of rain totaling 8-10 inches parish
wide(with some unverified reports of up to 17) which fell the weekend of
Sept 12, was the first appreciable rainfall since late spring. These rains,
combined with extremely high tides, flooded every source of mosquito
production in the 1100 square miles of the parish. Most of these areas had
not been flooded at all in 1998 and very little in late 1997. Therefore,
there were more than just a few _Psorophora_ eggs waiting to be
hatched, not to mention the enormous brood of _Ae. sollicitans_ on
the way from the high tides.
Efforts to control the massive brood began in vain. Although we do have
aircraft available, our primary pilot left employment the Thursday before
the brood and the secondary pilot was busy with his primary job and
unavailable. Trucks ran all night and aircraft were brought in from
Arkansas. The fact that we got a delayed start with the aircraft (2 days)
really crippled our efforts. But even if we would have had them immediately,
it would have still been an uphill battle. That is because we had the
emergence of this tremendous brood occurring over a three day period.
Mosquito populations reached proportions not seen in my 23 years here. In
fact, I had many of the long time residents tell me they had not experienced
populations of that magnitude since Hurricane Audrey which was 50 yrs ago.
Landing rates of 100-200 a minute were not uncommon in downtown Lake Charles
and some of the other municipalities. Schools canceled recesses because of
the problem. You can imagine what the mosquito populations in the fields and
marshes where the cattle were located must have been like. Some people in
the rural areas told me that they had to put bandannas over their faces any
time they would go outside, even if to just go and get the mail. On a drive
through the rice belt region of our parish and Jeff Davis parish just to the
east on Saturday Sept 19 at 6AM along I-10, the mosquitoes were so thick it
sounded like rain hitting the windshield; [the I-10 highway runs E-W about
45 miles from the coast here - MHJ. After daybreak, I had to stop
and clean off my windshield and found the grill of my car solid black
with Psoraphora. For those of you who have ever experienced love
bugs, that is what this looked like.
After 8 days of all night treatments with ground and aerial units, the
situation was brought to livable levels. The cost of controlling this
outbreak alone will be at least $200,000. With rains of 3-6 inches this past
weekend, we could once again be facing a similar scenario. This is
especially true since dry hot weather prevailed over the 2 weeks since the
rains of September 11-13.
I do not have a firm number of animals which succumbed to the mosquitoes.
However, it is thought to be around 35, with most being bulls and including
some horses. None of us in this business likes the fact that a single animal
died due to mosquitoes. But when populations get to the levels experienced
with this outbreak, and the fact that we are protecting 180 000 inhabitants
scattered over 1100 sq miles as well as all the cattle, none of us have the
needed equipment nor manpower to cover the territory necessary to bring
immediate relief for everyone and every herd of livestock.
So to answer Dr Steelman, yes everyone here in SW Louisiana was extremely
busy aggressively fighting this brood of mosquitoes. I do not know of one
employee here who was not working 12-20 hour days in this effort. Hopefully
we will not have a repeat of this situation this coming week. But, with the
recent heavy rains of this past weekend, coupled with the continued hot
weather and the heavy rain falling as I type this message, I would not bet
against it.

Now from Cameron Parish Mosquito Control:
Date: Tue, 06 Oct 1998 15:21:59 -0500
From: Don Menard <mosketer@structurex.net>

In Southwest Louisiana, massive multiple broods of _Aedes_ and
_Psorophora_ were produced throughout the entire area with one minute
landing rate counts ranging from 40 to well over 200 per minute. No
area was exempted from the hordes. In Cameron Parish, in the extreme
southwestern corner of the state, initial mosquito emergence began on
Sept. 17 in the ricefield areas, since _Psorophora_ emerge a day or
two sooner than _Aedes_.
We began spraying as soon as all larvae and pupae had emerged and continued
spraying for 17 days before complete control was realized. Cameron Parish is
1441 sq. miles in size and every foot of it had huge populations of
mosquitoes. We also have 4 wildlife management areas containing huge tracts
of salt marshes where mosquitoes are produced unabated and are off limits to
our spraying for the most part, allowing unimpeded reinfestations to
surrounding populated areas.
We have 2 airplanes and 6 ground units which sprayed all night every night
for the 15 day period, covering over 400,000 acres. As fast as we sprayed an
area, mosquitoes would migrate back in, sometimes in larger numbers than
before spraying. Eventually the broods were knocked down and reinfestation
decreased, but during the first week, no amount of spraying was able to make
a dent in them. Although I personally heard of only one unhealthy horse
dying in Cameron Parish, other areas weren't so lucky with mostly bulls
succumbing, since they don't herd up as the cows do and were unprotected.
The surrounding parishes were no different and likewise had an uphill battle
trying to combat them. In our case, all areas needed several sprayings
before the numbers were reduced to livable levels. Throughout this entire
area of the state, no repellents or insecticides were left on store shelves
due to the onslaught, preventing the citizens from protecting themselves and
their animals in lots of cases.

So, to answer the question, yes, we all did tremendous amounts of spraying,
it's just that sometimes it is just humanly impossible to adequately treat
such huge infestations. Help was sought from the federal and state
governments to get their big planes out, but as of yet, no help has been
forthcoming. I'd hate to see what would have happened if encephalitis was
present during the outbreaks and we were depending on the government to help.

This past weekend, we again received another 5 inches of rain and additional
high tides which has hatched off large broods parishwide and we're expecting
additional flooding today and tomorrow. Next week promises to be a repeat of
the last outbreak. I really feel for the parishes which have no spray
programs, as their mosquitoes are still bad. Hopefully winter will arrive
soon and slow the mosquito production down a little, but until then,
mosquitoes will remain at high levels in this area.

[Thanks Don - Mod. MHJ
[Not to knock the extraordinary stories above, but even after
correcting our math in the light of comments by readers, to suck 30
liters of blood out of a bull (2/3rds of its content) at 400 000
feeds per/l would take 12 million mosquitoes. Landing at the rate of
200/min this would take 60 000 mins. = 1000 hours = almost 42 days.
The exsanguination story just doesn't compute - Mod.JW
