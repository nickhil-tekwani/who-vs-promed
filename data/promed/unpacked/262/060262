Pepper races 7, 8, and 10 of _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pv. _vesicatoria_
isolated from diseased pepper plants in Turkey

of Agriculture, Ataturk University, 25240 Erzurum, Turkey, and
Biotechnology Application and Research Center, Ataturk University, 25240
Erzurum, Turkey) Accepted for publication 26/06/2001
In the summer of 1999 and 2000, 21 strains of _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pv.
vesicatoria_ (Xav) (Jones et al., 1998) were isolated from diseased pepper
plants grown in 15 greenhouses and 6 commercial fields in the Mediterranean
(Antalya) and eastern Anatolia (Erzurum, Erzincan, and Yusufeli) regions of
Turkey.
The strains were characterised ... by physiological tests, analysis of
whole cell fatty acids (FAME), indirect ... ELISA and pathogenicity and
hypersensitivity tests on pepper differential genotypes as previously
described (Bouzar et al., 1994). None of the strains were pectolytic or
amylolytic.
FAME analysis showed that all strains had similar fatty acid profiles, and
matched the strains to Xav with similarity indices ranging from 0.43 to
0.79. All strains reacted with a set of Xav-specific monoclonal antibodies
Xv1, 5, 6, and 10, but not with MABs Xv8, 15, and 30 known to react
positively with _X. vesicatoria_ or/and _X. gardneri_, the other taxa
besides Xav into which _X. campestris_ pv. _vesicatoria_ has been
reclassified (Bouzar et al., 1994; Jones et al., 1998). They were all
pathogenic on pepper (cv. Marengo) plants.
The results of hypersensitivity tests performed on pepper differential
lines that include _Capsicum pubescens_ PI 235047, _C. annuum_ cv. Early
Calwonder (ECW) and its near-isogenic lines (designated ECW-10R, ECW-20R,
and ECW-30R) showed that 8, 2, and 11 of the strains belonged to Xav pepper
races 7, 8, and 10, respectively (Kousik and Ritchie, 1999; Sahin and
Miller, 1998).
This is the first report of the observation of Xav pepper races 7, 8, and
10 on pepper in Turkey.

[2 valid names, _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pv. _vesicatoria_ (Xav) and _X.
campestris_ pv. vesicatoria_ (Xcv), have been published for the pathogen
that causes bacterial spot of pepper. Both can cause severe disease that
limits pepper production under conditions of high humidity and high
rainfall. In addition to Xav, 2 other pathogens (_X. vesicatoria_ and _X.
gardneri_) cause similar diseases on both tomato and pepper. Within each
species there are strains (races) that infect only pepper or tomato, or
both. The interaction between the pathogen and pepper is complex and is
conditioned by race and strain of the pathogen and corresponding avirulence
genes in pepper.
Control of the disease involves cultural practices (lowering the relative
humidity, strict management of water use, especially in glasshouse
production areas), use of resistant cultivars, and application of copper
sprays, although this can lead to copper-resistant strains of the pathogen.
A major resistance gene in pepper (Bs2) has recently been engineered into
tomato and has shown a high degree of resistance to Xav in that host,
suggesting that the pepper gene may be useful in preventing disease in
other solanaceous crops. See the following reference: T. H. Tai et al.
1999. Expression of the Bs2 pepper gene confers resistance to bacterial
spot disease in tomato. PNAS 96 (24): 14153-14158. - Mod.DH
