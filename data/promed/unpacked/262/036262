Outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Tamil Nadu state
------------------------------------------------------
Teams of veterinary doctors have been camping at villages in Chidambaram and Kattumannarkoil blocks after many cows were affected by foot-and-mouth disease (FMD).

Source said that cows were affected by the viral disease in neighbouring Nagapattinam district and it might have spread to Cuddalore as well. As complaints continue to pour in, the Animal Husbandry Department is on war footing to identify the affected cows and is in the process of vaccinating them.

Regional Animal Husbandry Department confirmed that there has been no death in the district due to the disease. Regional joint director (in-charge) of Animal Husbandry Department G S Ganesan said, "About 50 cows have been found with FMD."

[An earlier media report mentioned FMD serotype O as the causative agent behind the disease in Tamil Nadu. At present, the epizootic is reportedly affecting cattle in the entire southern part of India, including 3 other states: Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Kerala; see map at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm. The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map is available at http://healthmap.org/r/2kP3.

According to OIE's information, 10 FMD outbreaks were reported from Tamil Nadu during 2011, and one during (January) 2012. - Mod.AS]
