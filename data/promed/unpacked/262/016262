Mild Winter Brings Early Onslaught of Mosquitoes:
Have Equine Vaccinated Against "Sleeping Sickness"
After a mild winter, Louisiana already has reported its first case of
Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE), or "sleeping sickness"in a 6-year-old
unvaccinated Shetland pony in Vernon Parish, adjacent to Texas' Newton
County. "We recommend owners have their equine vaccinated against this
mosquito-borne disease, if they live east of Interstate 35, or if they plan
to travel to the area with their animals," said Dr. Terry Beals, Texas'
state veterinarian and executive director of the Texas Animal Health
Commission (TAHC), the state's livestock health regulatory agency.
"Veterinarians in Texas should report any cases to the TAHC or to the Texas
Department of Health (TDH), so the incidence of the disease can be tracked."
Dr. Joe Garrett, a veterinary epidemiologist with the Zoonosis Control
Division of the TDH, said encephalitis cases in equine signal public health
authorities that infected mosquitoes are or have been in the vicinity.
Although no cases have been reported in Texas in 20 years, humans can
contract the virus from infected mosquitoes. He advised ordinary
precautions be taken, such as controlling pests and wearing mosquito
repellent. Symptoms of the infection in humans include fever, headache,
vomiting, lethargy, neck stiffness, convulsions and coma.Equine affected by
"sleeping sickness" or encephalitis develop central nervous system
disorders, such as an irregular gait and circling, grinding of the teeth,
drowsiness, and an inability to swallow. Affected animals may have
paralysis of the limbs and be unable to rise. The TAHC and public health
officials advise owners to have symptomatic animals tested, because the
signs for rabies and "sleeping sickness" often mimic each other, and
appropriate preventive measures must be taken, if an owner is exposed to
rabies. In addition to horses, donkeys and mules, many species of birds,
such as emus, ostriches and rheas are susceptible to the "sleeping
sickness" virus.
Dr. Beals said private veterinary practitioners can administer a vaccine to
equine to provide protection against the Eastern and Western strains of
equine encephalitis. A "three-way" vaccine will protect against the
Venezuelan strain (VEE), which is considered to be a foreign animal disease
and is recommended for equine residing or traveling in South Texas. In
l996, several cases of VEE were diagnosed in Southwestern Mexico, and a
widespread vaccination campaign curbed the outbreak. The VEE vaccine will
cause a "false-positive" test result, so it should not be used on animals
that must be tested prior to international travel.
To protect animals and humans from mosquitoes, Dr. Garrett suggested
keeping window screens in good condition and urged outdoor enthusiasts to
wear mosquito repellent. Outdoor containers, such as flower pots and rain
gutters, should be drained to prevent a "breeding ground" for mosquitoes he
said, and water in birdbaths should be changed frequently.
