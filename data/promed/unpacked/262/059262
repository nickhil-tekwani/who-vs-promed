Localities urged to take drastic measures against bird flu

nationwide to take strict measures to control and put an end to the
spreading bird flu epidemic.
While quarantine measures are a must to protect poultry and people from the
disease, culling infected poultry and close monitoring the transport of
poultry and poultry products must be performed in all localities.
According to the Veterinary Department, on 28 Jan 2005, an additional 29
bird flu outbreaks were reported in 16 communes of 10 districts in the
provinces of Hai Duong, Bac Ninh, Bac Lieu, Long An, Ben Tre, Dong Nai, and

According to article 2.7.12.2. of OIE's Terrestrial animal-health code, a
country may be considered free from HPAI when it has been shown that HPAI
has not been present for at least the past 3 years. This period shall begin
6 months after the slaughter of the last affected animal for countries in
which a stamping-out policy is practised with or without vaccination
against HPAI. Japan and Malaysia have sent their final reports at the end
of the said 6-month periods, on 13 Jul 2004 and 4 Jan 2005 respectively,
regaining their HPAI-free status. - Mod.AS]
