Something is killing hundreds of ducks in a 2.2-million-gallon
treatment pond at a wastewater plant in north Denver. The ducks --
mostly northern shovelers [see image at URL below] -- frequent the
treatment plant by the thousands in the winter, drawn by warm water
and plentiful food -- tiny aquatic animals called zooplankton.
Since 2 Jan 2007, at least 200 ducks have died in a chlorine
treatment pool, and dozens of sick ducks have been sent to local
wildlife rehabilitation experts, said Steve Frank, spokesman for the
Metro Wastewater Reclamation District. The state Division of Wildlife
is investigating the deaths.
The problem does not appear to be bird flu or another avian disease,
said officials who are baffled by the deaths.
"Something is impacting their waterproofing," said Melanie Kaknes,
the state DOW district wildlife manager. Oily feathers normally help
waterfowl repel water, but the dead and dying ducks "are getting
soaked down real good" said Will Williams, a facilities maintenance
worker at Metro Wastewater. Williams helped chase down 8 sick birds
Saturday morning, spending more than 20 minutes to net a scared bird
that kept diving toward the bottom of the 14-foot deep basin.
In a small heated building on-site, 2 sick ducks cowered in a corner,
5 huddled quietly in a cage, and one sat nearly motionless in a pile
of rags, drying off. The bodies of scores of other ducks were sent
to the Division of Wildlife's Fort Collins research center for
testing, Kaknes said.
Birds are dying only in the site's chlorine contact pond, one of the
last stages before treated water flows into the nearby South Platte
River. For the last few days, workers have been setting off a noisy
propane cannon every 30 minutes, to startle birds from the surface of
the chlorine pond, Frank said. Five minutes after one burst scared 6
birds away, 2 flew back to settle on the steaming, warm water. "It's
marginally effective," Frank said.
Wastewater officials increased the concentration of chlorine in the
tanks in mid-December 2006 in a routine procedure change, he said.
Birds didn't start dying for a week or so after that, Frank said, and
since the original chemistry was restored Wednesday, they're still dying.
Wastewater and wildlife officials said they didn't know when tests
results would be available.
Kaknes said whatever is killing the birds in the wastewater treatment
tanks isn't affecting those just downstream. A few hundred feet away
from the deadly pool, hundreds of waterfowl floated in the South
Platte, in warm water released by the treatment plant.

[It is tempting to suggest that the change in chlorine level resulted
in the deaths. I do not know how long a change at one end of the
plant would be reflected in the chlorine pool being discussed, or
when the concentration would reach a level sufficient to affect the
birds. The article does not tell us the concentration used. The same
is likely true of the restoration of the chlorine level. It will
probably take a bit for it to equilibrate in pond so large.
Of course, it may not be the chlorine -- in which case we will look
forward to a more authoritative report as to the cause of death of
the ducks. - Mod.TG]
