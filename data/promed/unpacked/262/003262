Avian influenza situation in Egypt -- WHO update 20
---------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health of Egypt has reported 3 new confirmed human cases of
avian influenza A(H5N1).

The 1st case is a one year old boy from Domiat Governorate. His symptoms
started on 1 Jun 2009. He was admitted to hospital on 2 Jun 2009, where he
received oseltamivir treatment. The patient has recovered and was
discharged on 9 Jun 2009.

The 2nd case is a 4 year old girl from Dakhlia Governorate. Her symptoms
started on 5 Jun 2009. She was admitted to hospital on 6 Jun 2009, where
she received oseltamivir treatment. The patient has recovered and was
discharged on 14 Jun 2009.

The 3rd case is a one year old boy from Kaleen District, Kefr El Sheikh
Governorate. His symptoms started on 15 Jun 2009. He was admitted to Kefr
El Sheikh Fever Hospital on 16 Jun 2009, where he received oseltamivir
treatment and is in a stable condition.

Investigations into the source of infection indicated that all 3 cases had
close contact with dead and/or sick poultry.

The cases were confirmed by the Egyptian Central Public Health
Laboratories. Of the 81 cases confirmed to date in Egypt, 27 have been fatal.

[A map of the governorates of Egypt can be accessed at:
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governorates_of_Egypt>. Domiat Governorate is
located at 8 on this map, Dakhlia Governorate at 7, and Kefr El Sheikh
Governorate at 13.

Remarkably, all 3 cases are children younger than 5 years of age, and all 3
have recovered or are recovering. In fact, only 4 of some 30
(approximately) cases recorded in Egypt since the reappearance of avian
influenza A (H5N1) at the end of 2008 have been older than 6 years of age.
All patients appear to have recovered, but the information is patchy, and
these figures will be subject to revision. - Mod.CP]
