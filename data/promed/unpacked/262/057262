A cholera outbreak in northeast Cambodia has killed at least 96 people and
infected 1,538 since late April, aid agencies and hospital staff have
reported.
At least 89 people have died in the sparsely populated Ratanakiri province,
and seven other deaths were reported in neighboring Stung Treng province.
The remoteness of many of the affected areas and the poor state of health
care in Ratanakiri have frustrated health workers battling the disease.
A week ago they had hopes of controlling the outbreak, but an initial
shortage of medicine and organizational tangles have kept patients pouring
into the main hospital in the provincial capital of Banlung, about 200
miles northeast of Phnom Penh.
"I think we are stabilizing, but given the logistical problems, it is too
soon to be optimistic," Dr. Gerry Pais, chief provincial health adviser
from the aid agency Health Unlimited, said Sunday.
An added hurdle has been the poor hygiene and health awareness of hill
tribe settlements, which have been slow to accept rural development
initiatives that have brought clean water and medical knowledge to other
areas of impoverished Cambodia.
"If we can give them safe drinking water, I think it will solve 50 to 60
percent of their health problems," Pais said.
