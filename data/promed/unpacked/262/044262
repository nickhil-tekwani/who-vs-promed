The [Manipur] State Authority has yet to confirm the mysterious
disease that spread among the villagers of Churachandpur district
today [Thu 8 Jan 2009]. The sudden deaths of 17 chickens and
subsequent hospitalisation of 32 villagers, mostly women, with a
mysterious illness since Sunday [4 Jan 2009] has evoked a bird flu
scare in the district, particularly in the affected Misao Lhahvom
village, 72 km south of the state capital.

Though experts confirmed that there's no bird flu [in birds in the
area], they're still collecting blood samples of the hospitalized
villagers to verify the disease. Close on the heels of Additional
Director of the state health services Dr Th Bhubolchandra's visit to
hill district headquarters on Wednesday [7 Jan 2009], a team headed
by State Program Officer Nimaichand from the state vector-borne
diseases [office] came down to Churachandpur town today [8 Jan 2009].
"They collected blood samples of the patients besides visiting the
village today," a villager said.

According to an employee of Churachandpur district hospital, most of
the patients admitted there complained of high fever followed by
unconsciousness. Presently, 28 patients, mostly women, were given
treatment at the hospital after 10 of them were discharged, he added.

Locals believe that the cause of the disease might be related to food
poisoning in the recent Christmas celebration. However, Dr Motilal,
director of state health services, said it was [a] viral fever.
However, there is no report confirming the details of the disease
that hit the remote hill villages [up to the time of] the filing of
this report.

[The description of the symptoms of the disease affecting mainly
female residents in the village of Misao Lhahvom are too vague and
non-specific to suggest a diagnosis with reasonable certainty.
Further information on the progress of the outbreak and its
investigation would be welcomed.
