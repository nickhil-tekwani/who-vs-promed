Follow-up report No. 2
Text of an e-mail received on 20 July 1999 from Dr Stuart K. Hargreaves,
Director of Veterinary Services, Ministry of Agriculture, Harare:
End of previous report period: 8 July 1999 (see Disease Information, 12
[27, 99, dated 16 July 1999).
End of this report period: 19 July 1999.
Cases of disease have been recorded in cattle on Mkwasine Ranch (Masvingo
province).
Mkwasine Ranch is approximately 17,000 hectares, comprising 6,500 hectares
of cattle paddocks (four) and the remaining 10,500 hectares, which are
stocked with game, mainly impala (Aepyceros melampus), eland (Taurotragus
oryx) and wild African buffalo (Syncerus caffer). The cattle and game
sections are separated by fence barriers which prevent cattle-buffalo
contact.
The cattle population consists of 975 head of Brahman indigenous type,
managed in two mixed herds and a third herd of 17 bulls.
A total of 20 cases of disease have been recorded. Infection is very mild
due to the fact that the mainly breeding herd had been vaccinated routinely
three times annually.
Diagnosis:
Samples have been sent to the South Africa Foot and Mouth Disease Laboratory
and Botswana Vaccine Institute. The results of virus sequencing are awaited.
Epidemiology:
It is now believed that the infection reported at Mapanza Estate on 19 June
1999 could have originated on Mkwasine Ranch via slaughter of infected
cattle or game. Animals killed at Mkwasine Ranch for human consumption
locally have been transported as carcases, for dressing at Mapanza Estate
slaughter pole, approximately 25 km to the west. The manager of Mapanza
Estate also resides on Mkwasine Ranch.
Control measures during reporting period:
- Quarantine: Mkwasine Ranch is located within the quarantine area involved
with the Mapanza Estate outbreak. Veterinary personnel are resident at the
ranch to ensure no livestock movement occurs off the property and to carry
out disinfection as required.
- Restrictions on movement from, to and within Chiredzi district remain in
force.
- Revaccinations are currently in progress.
- Surveillance continues on farms within a 40-km radius of Mkwasine Ranch.

[There are several interesting things about this report. It is labelled:
Follow-up report (further suspicion), yet now, more than 5 weeks later,
there is no confirmation nor any sequencing results posted. Routine
vaccination was done but apparently did not stop spread -- could it have
been a faulty vaccine? And "fence barriers ... prevent cattle-buffalo
contact," but since FMD virus can travel literally miles downwind, these
could not be expected to prevent spread - Mod.JW
