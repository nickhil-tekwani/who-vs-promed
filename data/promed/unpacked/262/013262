The Health Ministry on Saturday [15 Dec 2007] confirmed that a man
who died after culling infected birds at a poultry farm was the
country's 1st fatality from the bird flu virus. One of the man's
brothers who took part in the cull also died, but he was not tested
for the virus, a Ministry spokesman told AFP. It was not immediately
known why the 2nd man was not tested [Previously, it was reported
that he had been buried before samples could be taken. - Mod.CP].

The spokesman ruled out any case of human-to-human transmission, a
development that could have signaled a mutation of the virus with the
possibility to kill millions around the world. 6 people were
confirmed to have been infected with the H5N1 strain of avian
influenza, all of them in the North Western Frontier Province (NWFP),
the Ministry said in a statement. "5 of them have fully recovered.
One of the confirmed cases died in hospital, while his brother, who
could not be tested, has also died," it said.

Ministry spokesman Mazhar Nisar said the confirmed victim, the brother
who died, and 2 other brothers who were infected but survived all
worked on the same cull of infected birds. "We are not certain how
(the brother) died
because we could not conduct his testing," Nisar said.

Hospital officials in Peshawar [NWFP] told AFP that the confirmed
victim died late last month [November 2007], a few days before his
brother, who was admitted with similar symptoms but was not tested.
Nisar said there had been no human transmission in this case.

[This report provides a new twist to the story, contradicting some
previously reported statements from the Ministry. In this version, the
number of confirmed cases is 6, 5 of whom have recovered. Two of 4
brothers
tested H5N1-positive, while a 3rd died but was not tested. Three of
these 4 brothers, including the 2 fatal cases and one of the 2
surviving brothers, were employed in poultry culling. (Elsewhere it
is recorded that the 4th was a visitor now returned to the USA and
found to be H5N1-negative there). If this version of the story is
correct, it is likely that the brothers were infected from the same
source in the course of their employment and that human-to-human
transmission has not occurred. Further clarification and verification
of the diagnoses by an independent source are awaited. - Mod.CP]
