In the last 4 days, 3 people with symptoms of encephalitis have died at the Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical College and Hospital (ANMCH) in Gaya and 5 others are being treated.

Confirming the 3 deaths, a senior doctor at ANMCH said the patients were brought to the hospital from remote areas in serious condition. "If patients are brought to the health facility soon after they develop AES (acute encephalitis syndrome) symptoms, such as high fever and body ache, the chances of their survival are high. But delayed arrival only complicates the cases, which sometimes go beyond our control," he said.

Encephalitis is an acute inflammation of the brain. Its symptoms also include drowsiness, fatigue, seizures or convulsions, tremors, hallucinations, stroke and memory problems.

ANMCH superintendent Dr Sudhir Kumar Sinha said he was awaiting reports of the blood test to find out the actual cause of the deaths. "We cannot say with certainty if the patients were suffering from AES. Although initial tests hinted at some JE (Japanese encephalitis) symptoms, the report of the final examination of blood samples will confirm the nature of the disease. "All the 3 patients who died had tested negative for JE despite some symptoms of the disease. Other reports are still awaited, but we have taken it as cases of AES in view of initial symptoms," Dr Sinha said.

The other patients with AES symptoms are under observation, he said, adding that they were out of danger and recovering gradually. The ANMCH has set up a separate unit for these patients. Hospital sources said 77 patients with JE symptoms were admitted to the health facility last year [2015], 12 of whom died as they were admitted in serious conditions.

[Cases of JE, as well as the undetermined AES occur in Behar and northeastern India every year at this time. AES is a term used for multiple etiologies or often when no etiology has been determined. As mentioned in many previous comments, the encephalitis picture in northeastern India is complicated. The JE virus etiology of some previously reported encephalitis cases has been confirmed by laboratory tests. However, many cases go undiagnosed, or JE virus infection is ruled out, and other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease and lychee consumption, have been proposed. - Mod.TY
