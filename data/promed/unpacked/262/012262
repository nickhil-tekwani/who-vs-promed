Area Dogs Contract Rare Deadly Disease; Leptospirosis Can Be Passed To Humans
----------------------------------------------
Veterinarians are keeping a close watch on a rare, potentially deadly
disease that has killed several dogs in the area.
Leptospirosis, commonly called swamp fever, is a concern because it's an
often-fatal disease and one of the few diseases that can be passed from
dogs to humans, Anna Davlantes reported for NBC5.
"The 1st sign was Tuesday morning, and by that Friday night, that's when we
decided to euthanize him, so about 85 hours," said Jim Sorenson, who
recently lost a bulldog. "He was a healthy, 85-pound dog."
Dogs can contract the bacterial disease after coming into contact with the
urine of an infected animal. It's more commonly found near wild animals and
in stagnant waters.
"There are number of cases of leptospirosis in the Chicago area, and that's
a serious consideration because of how severe the disease can be," said
veterinarian Dr. Glenn Mayer.
Humans can also contract the disease. The largest outbreak on record in the
western hemisphere, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, happened in Illinois in 1998. After swimming in Lake
Springfield, 110 triathletes became sick.
While it is typically not fatal in humans, it is often fatal in dogs,
because the early signs are hard to detect.
"Your dog is not feeling well, if they're acting lethargic, if they are
running a fever and if they have some muscle tenderness, those are some of
the first signs we would see," Mayer said.
There are vaccines for dogs, and experts said dog owners should consider
them, particularly for dogs that spend a lot of time outside or live near
ponds or marshy areas. Some dogs have bad reactions to the vaccine.

[Although Chicago area has had outbreaks of leptospirosis in the past, it
is unusual to find it there. What this article does not say is whether the
cases are all swimming or drinking from a common water source. - Mod.TG]
