Panama: Greater Panama City on verge of dengue fever epidemic
-------------------------------------------------------------
PANAMA CITY: More than 860 cases of dengue fever and another 6 cases of the
potentially deadly dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) have been reported in
Panama so far this year, placing the country on the verge of an epidemic,
national health authorities warned on Wed 21 Nov 2001. In Panama City 3
cases of DHF have been reported, while the other 3 cases were reported on
the western outskirts of the capital in the La Chorrera district.
Health authorities said 864 cases of the less dangerous variety of dengue
fever have been reported so far this year, most of them in Panama City and
in outlying areas west of the city. A spokesman for the Panamanian Health
Ministry said the area west of Panama City, home to some 150 000 people,
runs the risk of an epidemic of the potentially deadly DHF. The spokesman
said that more than 400 cases of dengue fever have been detected in that
area so far this year.
The symptoms of DHF include headaches, abdominal pains, a high fever,
bleeding from the eyes, and respiratory problems. At first, the symptoms
are easily and often mistaken for influenza. National health authorities
have continuously urged residents to eliminate any potential breeding
grounds for the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, which transmits the disease.
According to official figures from the Health Ministry, a total of 317
cases of dengue fever and one case of DHF, none of which proved deadly,
were reported in Panama in 2000, a number much lower than year-to-date
cases this year.

Venezuela: Dengue 2 virus in Venezuela from 1997 to 2000
--------------------------------------------------------
Epidemic outbreaks of dengue fever (DF) were first recorded in Venezuela in
1978 and were followed by the emergence of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)
outbreaks in 1989. To gain a better understanding of the nature of these
epidemics, the complete envelope (E) gene sequence of 34 Venezuelan dengue
type 2 (DEN-2) viruses, isolated between 1997 and 2000, was determined. Of
these isolates, 16 were from patients with DF, and 17 were from patients
with DHF. There were no diagnostic sequence differences between them, which
suggests that the E gene alone does not determine disease severity.
These sequence data were also used in phylogenetic comparisons with a
global sample of DEN-2 viruses, including strains collected previously from
Venezuela. This analysis revealed that the ancestors of the Venezuelan
viruses were Asian in origin, implying that a DEN-2 virus strain from this
region was introduced into Venezuela and the wider Caribbean region in the
late 1970s or the early 1980s.
The phylogenetic trees further indicate that evolution of DEN-2 virus in
Venezuela has occurred in situ, with differentiation into a number of
distinct but co-circulating lineages, rather than the repeated introduction
of new strains from other localities.
By incorporating additional sequence data from the virus capsid,
premembrane, and membrane genes, evidence is provided that a single
Venezuelan strain sequenced previously, designated Mara4, is a recombinant
virus, incorporating genome sequence from Venezuelan and Asian parental
viruses.

[These observations indicate that dengue type 2 virus (DEN-2) has evolved
within Venezuela since at least the early 1980s by both genetic drift and
recombination, and that different genotypes may co-circulate during an
epidemic. The data are consistent with the interpretation that the
prevalence of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) in Venezuela is a consequence
of the introduction of a South East Asian strain of DEN-2 endowed with
greater virulence than the indigenous Latin American strains not previously
associated with DHF. - Mod.CP

Malaysia: Dengue fever outbreak close to end
--------------------------------------------
A total of 497 confirmed dengue cases were detected between 1 Jan and 17
Nov 2001 in Penang, state executive councillor for health Dr K Rajapathy
said today [Wed 28 Nov. Of the total, 254 cases were detected in the
island and the rest in Seberang Perai on the mainland; 39 of these were
dengue hemorrhagic fever.
[Of the recent cases, 198 confirmed dengue fever were reported in 3 areas;
Lorong Sungai Dua (144), Tanjung Tokong Police Barracks (29) and Taman Free
School (25). Dr Rajapathy said that Taman Free School was declared
dengue-free on 23 Nov 2001, while Tanjung Tokong police barracks would be
declared the same on 30 Nov 2001 if no fresh cases were reported. The last
dengue case in the area was detected on 16 Nov 2001. He said Lorong Sungai
Dua would be declared free from dengue on 2 Dec 2001 as the last case was
reported on 18 Nov 2001.
Meanwhile, acting state health director Dr Azmi Shafie said the department
had issued 98 compounds [sic to 12 houses in Sungai Dua, Taman Free School
(78) and 8 in Tanjung Tokong Police Barracks. A total of 345 000 premises
were checked and 1550 compounds [sic were issued as they were found to
have mosquito breeding grounds, he added.
