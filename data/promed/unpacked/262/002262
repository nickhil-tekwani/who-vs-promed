One person has died in the Chirgaun area of Shimla district of Himachal Pradesh state in India, and another 100 have been bitten by mad dogs, which were bitten by a rabid dog coming from outside the village. All are being given low cost intradermal anti-rabies vaccine.

[Since 2008, the only OIE report of rabies in Himachal Pradesh was in 2010 and involved 4 dogs. This is a very mountainous Indian state and thus difficult to administer. Getting out to vaccinate the village dogs in Chirgaun would be a challenge, even in good weather. The Simla HP people are to be congratulated on vaccinating all the humans exposed in this incident. And our heartfelt thanks go to Dr. Bharti for his report.

I would like to take this opportunity to make a point. The core purpose of ProMED-mail is to increase awareness of unusual events, mainly from infectious diseases and toxic events in humans, animals, and food plants, that may have a terrorist origin. To do this, ProMED-mail reports normal events with some concentration on emerging diseases so that there is a running awareness of the normal. Our members are ProMED's eyes on the ground. You are the people who will see events before anyone else. For convenience, we moderators use the local press and TV reports, and those by the local and regional health services. But our members are a very important trip-wire for quick reporting. You are there for a purpose, not just to provide funding, for which we are grateful, though frankly it would be nice if more than 3 percent put their hands in their pockets. Our members are our eyes and ears.
