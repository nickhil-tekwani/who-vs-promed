At least 3 Namibians are suspected to have been infected with the deadly
Rift Valley fever (RVF) [virus]. This comes close to 5 months after tens of
Namibian animals were infected with RVF [virus] in the 1st outbreak of the
disease in the country since 1985.

A notice about the 3 affected farmers was published in the weekly
newsletter of the Namibia Agricultural Union (NAU) last Friday [27 Aug
2010]. Until yesterday [2 Sep 2010], however, Dr Jack Vries, chairperson of
the Ministry of Health and Social Service's National Health Emergency
Management Committee, had not been officially informed about the cases.
Vries told The Namibian that none of the country's 2 laboratories had made
any positive diagnoses. This, he said, could be as a result of patients
being tested in South Africa or not being tested at all.

A Dorper sheep farmer, in the south of the country, yesterday [2 Sep 2010]
said that he accidentally injected himself whilst he was busy immunising
his sheep about 3 weeks ago. "I accidentally injected myself that Friday
afternoon. By 1900 [that evening], I realised there was big trouble."
According to him, he could by then not even talk anymore. Apart from this,
he experienced a high fever, an increased heart beat and painful urination.
"I also had terrible headaches. My urine was golden yellow, and it was
painful when I urinated. And the heartbeats, it feels like your heart wants
to run away." It was only by Saturday afternoon that he could talk again,
he said. The farmer said that he decided not to go to a doctor. Instead, he
spent a week in bed. A veterinarian he spoke to told him that it "must be"
RVF, he said.

In its newsletter, the NAU urged farmers "to be very cautious when animals
are vaccinated against RVF. If one gets pricked by the needle, the disease
can be contracted through the vaccine." The union issued this warning
"following the confirmation of 3 farmers in the south of Namibia who were
identified with the dreaded RVF."

Dr Cleopas Bamhare, acting chief veterinary officer in the Ministry of
Agriculture, Water and Forestry, earlier warned people to wear rubber
gloves and face masks when they come into close contact with sick animals,
aborted foetuses, blood and other body fluids, especially during handling,
slaughtering, butchering and milking, to avoid human infections. Meat
intended for human consumption needs to be chilled and matured at 2 C for
at least 24 hours. This, he said, will inactivate the virus if it is
present. The past week, Bamhare said no new animal infections have been
reported to his office.

Earlier this year [2010], it was reported that close to a 100 animals were
affected in Namibia. Half of these died. Namibian farmers lost millions of
dollars as a result of export bans that were in place when the outbreak was
rife. More than 20 humans and hundreds of animals died in neighbouring
South Africa during a recent RVF outbreak there.

Bamhare also earlier warned Namibians that RVF could cause a widespread
epidemic in the next rainy season.

According to Vries, the man would have landed in the intensive care unit
(ICU) had it been RVF. However, another doctor The Namibian spoke to said
it is "definitely possible" for the farmer to have contracted the virus
through the live vaccine. The farmer confirmed that it was the live vaccine.

[The statement of the Namibia Agricultural Union that RVF virus infection
in the 3 farmers was confirmed is not supported by other information, nor
by the statement that samples were not tested by either of the country's 2
laboratories. The vaccine that the affected farmer used for vaccinating his
sheep was the live, attenuated Smithburn product. Presumably, it might
infect a human following needlestick injury.

Possible exposures of the other 2 farmers is not given. Conceivably, the
farmers may have been bitten by transovarially infected mosquitoes carrying
the virus that remained in the area following the last outbreak earlier
this year (2010). Several bunyaviruses, including RVF virus, can be
transovarially transmitted in _Aedes_ mosquitoes, and the virus-containing
eggs may remain viable for long periods of time in low-lying areas
("dambos" in East Africa). However, in the absence of cases in livestock,
this possibility seems unlikely. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving
further information confirming or ruling out RVF virus infection.
