Re: ProMED-mail post Avian influenza (52): Nigeria (SO) poultry, H5N6, 1st case, OIE, RFI 20191129.6802815
------------------------------------------------------------

The URL of the OIE report published by ProMED-mail on 29 Nov 2019, archive number 20191129.6802815, is no longer available. On 23 Dec 2019, Nigeria sent a new immediate notification to the OIE replacing the report sent in November.

The epidemiological comments made in this latest OIE report noted: "The original report submitted [on 27 Nov 2019] for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) with OIE reference number 32493 was deleted and replaced with the report number 32513 for low pathogenic avian influenza [on 29 Nov 2019]. The latter report and correspondent follow-up report no. 32654 were subsequently deleted [on 20 Dec 2019] and replaced by the current immediate notification. These changes were done due to the intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) laboratory analysis which confirmed the H5N6 as highly pathogenic avian influenza."
