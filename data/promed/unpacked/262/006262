Correction to archive:
Influenza A (H1N1) - worldwide (78): Tamiflu resistance, DK 20090630.2359
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
It was erroneously stated in the moderator's comment to the above
ProMED-mail post with reference to the weekly bulletin of the European
Influenza Surveillance Scheme (EISS) for week 25 (issued 26 June 2009) that
"all seasonal A(H1N1) viruses tested have been sensitive to oseltamivir and
zanamivir but resistant to M2 inhibitors, although elsewhere Tamiflu
resistance has been observed in A H1N1 seasonal viruses." The moderator
misread the strain name. In the original message it says: "All A(H1N1)v
viruses tested have been sensitive to oseltamivir and zanamivir but
resistant to M2 inhibitors." WHO has designated the new influenza A(H1N1)
pandemic strain A(H1N1)v.

Actually 98 per cent of all seasonal A(H1N1) viruses in the European region
for the 2008/2009 season were resistant against oseltamivir, but all
sensitive to zanamivir and all but one sensitive to amantadine, similar to
the rest of the world. For reference about this statement see the ECDC
website <http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/Health_Topics/influenza/antivirals.aspx>.

Monitoring of influenza virus antiviral resistance in the European Unionand
EEA/EFTA countries is carried out by the Community Network of Reference
Laboratories for Human Influenza in Europe (CNRL) under the aegis of the
European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in Stockholm, Sweden.
The coordinators of the CNRL are located at the WHO collaborating centre
for reference and research on influenza and the Health Protection Agency
(HPA), London, UK, and the National Institute for Public Health and the
Environment, Bilthoven, the Netherlands. The coordinators of the CNRL
routinely collect, analyze and disseminate information on antiviral
resistance from influenza viruses from 25 European (European Union,
EEA/EFTA) countries. Data are provided by laboratories in the CNRL, which
are WHO recognized National Influenza Centres, and the central testing
laboratory at the HPA for reference purposes and countries that do not have
the capacity for antiviral resistance monitoring.

The analysis of resistance against neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir
and zanamivir) and M2-ion channel blockers (amantadine and rimantadine) is
done by measuring IC50 values and/or by genotyping of viruses for detection
of known drug resistance mutations. Influenza A viruses are fully cross
resistant for amantadine and rimantadine. During the 2008/2009 influenza
season in Europe antiviral resistance monitoring activities revealed that
based on shared data by 12 June 2009:
- all analysed A(H3N2) influenza viruses were sensitive for oseltamivir and
zanamivir but resistant against the M2-ion channnel blockers (amantadine
and rimantadine);
- of the analysed seasonal A(H1N1) influenza viruses 98 per cent were
resistant against oseltamivir but sensitive for zanamivir and except one
virus all sensitive for the M2-ion channel blockers;
- of the analysed influenza B viruses all were sensitive for oseltamivir
and zanamivir (M2-ion channel blockers do not act on influenza B viruses);
- before the report of the oseltamivir resistant influenza virus A(H1N1)v
(the 2009 pandemic A(H1N1) variant) in Denmark, all A(H1N1)v viruses
analysed were sensitive for oseltamivir and zanamivir but resistant against
the M2-ion channel blockers.

[This moderator regrets this misunderstanding and the archived report will
be amended accordingly. I have to confess that I was not aware at the time
that A(H1N1)v is now the official WHO designation for the new influenza
A(H1N1) pandemic strain. This abbreviation has not been in general use and
perhaps my error will help to make this new designation generally known. -
