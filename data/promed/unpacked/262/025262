Kuwaiti man cleared of MERS, returns home
-----------------------------------------
The Kuwaiti teen identified as a probable MERS case has been officially cleared of the virus and has left Thailand, the Disease Control Department director said on Thursday [4 Aug 2016].

The 18-year-old's father and grandmother who had been placed in quarantine also tested negative for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), Amnuay Gajeena said.

The 3 were released from the Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute in Nonthaburi on Wednesday [3 Aug 2016] and flew home at 3am on Thursday [4 Aug 2016].

Clinical specimens taken from the 3 were negative for MERS in the 2nd, final round of testing at 4 laboratories -- the Medical Sciences Department, Bamrasnaradura, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital and Ramathibodi Hospital. "The man had no fever or any other symptoms of the illness. He was healthy and ready for his journey home," Dr Amnuay said.

The unnamed man fell ill last Tuesday [26 Jul 2016], a day after he arrived in Thailand. Health officials suspected MERS and put him into isolation immediately.
