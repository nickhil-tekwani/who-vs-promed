[This information is from the USDA-APHIS-VS Epizootiology and Ecology
of Anthrax. See
http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/emergingissues/downloads/anthrax.pdf.

Anthrax is an acute, febrile disease of warm-blooded animals,
including humans. Anthrax is caused by _Bacillus anthracis_, a Gram
positive, non-motile, spore-forming bacterium, and it occurs most
commonly as a rapidly fatal septicemia in animals.

Anthrax outbreaks in animals in nearly 200 countries are recorded by
The World Anthrax Data Site, a World Health Organization Collaborating
Center for Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems for
Public Health. Anthrax is a globally distributed disease, having been
reported by all continents that are populated densely with animals and
humans. The number of cases of anthrax in animals has decreased
significantly during the latter half of the twentieth century due to
enhanced control and prevention programs which include efficacious
vaccination.

The World Anthrax Data Site also indicates the countries of the
former Yugoslavia have a sporadic anthrax status or are missing
information, with the exception of Macedonia where anthrax is endemic.
