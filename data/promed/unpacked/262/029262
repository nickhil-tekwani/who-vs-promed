Local health authorities are alarmed by the outbreak of diarrhea in 9 sitios of Barangay Santiago here, affecting 265 residents as of 2 p.m. on Mon 31 Jan [2022].

Dr. Chris Anthony Limen, Caraga municipal health officer, said they noted the 1st cases at Sitio Atipo of Santiago village Sunday [30 Jan 2022] noon, but as of 9 a.m. on Monday [31 Jan 2022], a total of 137 diarrhea cases, including those in other sitios (subvillages) were recorded. Another 4 hours brought about 15 more cases, and as of 2 p.m. on that day, the number of documented cases surged to 265, covering all 9 sitios (subvillages) of Barangay Santiago, Limen said.

"The outbreak is very alarming based on the rate of increase in the number of patients. There are almost 150 cases recorded in less than 48 hours," he said.

Sitio Atipo, where the 1st cases were noted, recorded a total of 60 patients, but as of 2 p.m. on Monday [30 Jan 2022], neighboring Sitio Lower Mansanas also logged in 110 cases.

Limen said they were still trying to confirm whether one reported fatality due to dehydration in Barangay Santiago was among the cases. He also warned villagers not to drink water from their faucets. The Davao Oriental provincial health office confirmed at 2:30 p.m. on Monday [30 Jan 2022] that cholera, caused by drinking contaminated water, had caused diarrhea. Local officials issued calls for help to bring to affected residents the much-needed potable water and drinks to hydrate them.

Cholera had been reported in the area before. The province's sanitary office had warned that the existing water system had to be rehabilitated as soon as the 1st cholera cases were reported. Limen stressed the need for concerted efforts to contain the outbreak.

The water source of Santiago, which has been suspected of having caused the outbreak, is due for rehabilitation, local officials said. The provincial government of Davao Oriental has reportedly allocated PHP 20 million [USD 391 961] for the rehabilitation project, but actual works on the ground have yet to start.

[Davao Oriental is a province in the Philippines located in the Davao Region on Mindanao. Mindanao is the 2nd-largest island in the Philippines, after Luzon, and 7th-most populous island in the world, located in the southern region of the archipelago.

As stated by Lutwick et al. (Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P. Cholera. In Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Edited by Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J. New York: Nova Bioscience; 2017, pp 113-127), oral rehydration therapy can be lifesaving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Guerrant et al. (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it first recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al. (1) highlight the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30% to 3.6% (4) and quote sources referring to ORT as 'potentially the most important medical advance' of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally, glucose or rice powder based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 mL/kg followed by 100 mL/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 mL/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
