Cholera in Angola had spread to a 15th province, as the death toll
reached 2089, and the number of cases exceeded 50 000, said the WHO
on Mon 24 Jul 2006.
WHO reported that "the southern province of Cuando Cubango confirmed
cholera cases on 19 Jul 2006. Up to now, there were 48 cumulative
cases and 6 deaths."
The WHO also reported that from 13 Feb to 23 Jul 2006, "a total of 50
768 cumulative cases and 2089 deaths have been reported in 15 out of
the 18 provinces" in Angola. It added that 62 new cases and 2 deaths
had been reported in the previous 24 hours alone.
The highest toll since February 2006 was recorded in the eastern
coastal province of Benguela, with 517 deaths, followed by 302
fatalities in Luanda and 244 in the Malange region.
The deadly but easily treatable water-borne disease broke out
initially in Luanda's northern slum of Boa Vista and rapidly spread
throughout the seaside capital and to other parts of the oil-rich
southern African country.

In Zanzibar, 300 children have been hospitalized in July 2006 after
drinking dirty water. The children, between the ages of 6 months and
2 years, suffered from severe diarrhea, said Dr. Fatma Aboud of Mnazi
Mmoja Hospital. The facility was forced to put as many as 3 children
in one bed because of the outbreak, she said.
"The illnesses are not life-threatening, but we call upon parents to
boil water before drinking it and to keep their environments clean,"
Aboud said.
Zanzibar, a semiautonomous part of Tanzania, has a persistent water
shortage. In many parts of this impoverished nation, residents rely
on leaking pipes or ponds for drinking water.

With the influx of diarrhea patients in various hospitals of the
Capital city, some of the hospitals even detected cholera bacteria
among some of the patients recently. Caused by lack of clean and
uncontaminated drinking water during the time of rainy season, a
large number of people fall victim to the diarrhea and cholera
bacteria every year.
According to information provided by the Kanti Children's Hospital,
the number of diarrhea patients has surged in the month of Shrawan
(July/August) in 2006 as well, of which 3 patients were detected with
the cholera bacterium on 16, 24, and 25 Jul 2006.
The hospital is witnessing some 14 to 15 children being admitted with
gastroenteritis everyday. The department of gastroenteritis at the
hospital today [27 Jul 2006] forwarded stool samples of 3 patients
for laboratory testing among the patients admitted in the hospital
who displayed symptoms of cholera. There have been no cases of death
caused by diarrhea and cholera reported this year [2006].
Meanwhile, Teku Hospital is witnessing a maximum number of patients
suffering from diarrhea these days, but Director of the Hospital Dr.
Kokila Shrestha stated that none of the patients have been diagnosed
with cholera so far. More than 50 patients suffering from diarrhea
are coming to the hospital for treatment everyday. The hospital
record revealed that 7 cases of cholera were diagnosed among the
patients who were treated by the hospital in 2005.
