Cases of trichinosis have become a rare occurrence in Germany, as all
pigs are examined for trichinae upon slaughter. Isolated cases of
disease that occurred recently were traced to the consumption of meat
products from risk areas in Eastern Europe. In January 2007, 3
members of one family became ill after staying with relatives in
Romania. Raw sausage and ham from a pig slaughtered at home were
identified as the source of infection.
More than 170 people recently contracted trichinosis in the Polish
holiday region of West Pomerania. The outbreak was very likely caused
by raw (Polish) sausage contaminated with trichinae, which was only
sold locally and has since been withdrawn from the market by the
manufacturer. Up to now, there have been no reports of illness among
German holiday-makers.
These examples show that there may be a health risk when the
regulations governing food production are not systematically complied
with and meat containing trichinae is used in sausage production. "In
Eastern European countries which have a higher risk of trichinosis,
travelers can protect themselves by not eating any raw meat or
products made from it like raw sausage or raw ham," recommended BfR
President Professor Dr. Andreas Hensel. Tourists should not bring any
raw sausage or raw ham back with them from these countries either.
Trichinosis (synonym trichinellosis) is a rare but dangerous
foodborne disease. It is caused by nematode worms of the genus
_Trichinella_. Humans can ingest the larvae in the muscle tissue from
raw or inadequately cooked meat but also from raw sausages produced
from the meat of infested pigs.
In the intestinal mucosa, the larvae mature into nematode worms and
produce larvae there, which invade muscle tissue. The initial signs
of infection are fatigue, insomnia, diarrhea and vomiting. After one
to 2 weeks, typical symptoms manifest, like facial water retention
(edemas), myosclerosis and muscle soreness.
Testing of pigs for trichinae is, therefore, mandatory in the
European Union. Domestic herds of pigs in Germany are free of
trichinae aside from very rare isolated cases. By contrast, in other
countries (like, for instance, Romania, Poland, Croatia, Serbia,
Lithuania, Latvia), both domestic pigs and wild boars may be infected
with these parasites.
Raw meat or products made from it, like raw sausage or raw ham,
should not be consumed in these countries on precautionary grounds.
They don't belong in luggage either.
Trichina larvae in pork are destroyed when meat is frozen for more
than 20 days at -15 C. The pieces should not be thicker than 15 cm to
ensure the temperature is reached in the core as well. The larvae are
also destroyed during boiling and roasting when the meat is
sufficiently heated until its core color is grey. Anyone who develops
these symptoms should immediately consult a doctor and inform him or
her that they have eaten these sausage products. The doctor can then
establish whether the symptoms are those of trichinosis or whether
they are merely a comparatively harmless case of a flu-like infection
with similar symptoms.

[_Trichinella_ infections are common in Eastern Europe as seen from
several ProMED reports (see below). The source is not always found,
but it may be domestic pigs kept in the backyard and fed household
waste and offal. These backyard pigs are often slaughtered and sold
without the mandatory veterinary inspection and have a much higher
risk of being infected with _Trichinella_ compared to
commercially-raised pigs. Another problem is the mixing of meat from
wild boars into sausages and selling them labeled as from domestic
pigs, also outside of any veterinary inspection.
The last outbreak we have seen in Poland was in 2003 (see below). In
both cases, buying homemade sausage and other meat products at local
markets were the major risk. - Mod.EP]
