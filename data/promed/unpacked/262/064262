Outbreaks of serotype 5 and serotype 8 invasive pneumococcal disease in
Calgary, Alberta, Canada
-----------------------
The Calgary Area _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ Epidemiology Research (CASPER)
team has been conducting population-based surveillance for invasive
pneumococcal disease (IPD) in the city of Calgary (population approx. 1 000
000) since 1998 (Kellner JD et al. Progress in the Prevention of
Pneumococcal Infection. Can Med Assoc J 2005; 173: 1149). There have been
an average of 105 cases of IPD each year. A province-wide program to
provide the 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine to all persons 65
years and older, and to high-risk persons from 5 to 64 years began in 1998.
The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was introduced for
routine use in infants in 2002.
From 1998 to 2000, there were 0 cases of serotype 5 (ST5) IPD. There was 1
case in each of 2001 and 2002, then 0 cases again in 2003 and 2004. In
2005, there were 7 cases in the city of Calgary and 8 more cases in the
surrounding region. In 2006, there have been 52 cases in the city and
surrounding region to date. The 1st case of ST5 IPD in our region in 2005
occurred in February in a 44 year old female from a community east of
Calgary. The next several cases occurred in aboriginal persons living in or
near a First Nations Reserve east of Calgary. Since then the vast majority
of cases have occurred in persons from the inner city region of Calgary.
Cases have occurred more frequently in recent weeks. There have been 12
cases since 22 Nov 2006, including 9 who had recently stayed in one
particular shelter for homeless persons. It is of note that Calgary has
recently experienced a prolonged cold weather spell and all temporary
shelters have been very crowded. Preliminary analysis of all ST5 cases as
well as the isolates has been performed. Most cases had bacteremic
pneumonia. Several have had empyema. There has been one death.
Most cases have multiple risk factors that differ from non-ST5 IPD cases.
The following factors have been identified when comparing all ST5 IPD cases
in 2006 with 513 non-ST5 IPD cases in adults (children have been excluded
from this analysis because only 2 cases have occurred in children). For
each factor, the odds ratio (95 per cent confidence interval) is given for
association of the factor with ST5:
Age 16-64 years - OR 14.0 (5.0 - 39.4)
Aboriginal - OR 3.0 (1.3 - 6.6)
Homelessness - OR 12.2 (6.4 - 23.1)
Alcoholism - OR 2.5 (1.4 - 4.6)
Illegal drug use - OR 7.9 (4.2 - 15.0)
Hepatitis B or C - OR 3.2 (1.5 - 6.8)
All but one of the isolates tested to date are susceptible to penicillin
and non-susceptible to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Preliminary pulsed
field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) has
been performed at the National Centre for Streptococcus.
The ST5 isolates appear at be clonal and are related to a strain previously
described from Colombia and the Pneumococcal Molecular Epidemiology Network
(Colombia5-19 strain clone,
<http://www.sph.emory.edu/PMEN/pmen_table1.html>, Tamayo et al. J Clin
Microbiol 1999; 37: 2337).
From 1998 to 2003, there were 0 to 5 cases of serotype 8 (ST8) IPD each
year. In 2004 there were 12 cases, then 23 cases in 2005 and 12 cases to
date in 2006 (with just 2 cases since June). The factors associated with
these ST8 IPD cases are similar to the factors associated with ST5 cases.
In addition to surveillance for IPD, we have been conducting twice-yearly
surveys of nasopharyngeal colonization with pneumococcus in infants and
young children in Calgary (Kellner JD et al. 5th International Symposium on
Pneumococci and Pneumococcal Diseases (ISPPD5), Alice Springs, Australia,
2006). From 2003 to 2005, 679 pneumococcal isolates were obtained from 3398
children. The overall rate of colonization has not changed, but the rate of
colonization with vaccine serotypes has decreased significantly and the
rate of colonization with non-vaccine serotypes has increased
significantly. However, no children were colonized with serotype 5 and just
one was colonized with serotype 8.
In June 2006, the Alberta Advisory Committee on Communicable Disease
Control recommended offering the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (that
includes ST5 and ST8) to all homeless persons, all hepatitis C positive
persons, and to those with other risk factors identified in the outbreak. A
mass immunization program for homeless persons and those with related risk
factors in Calgary is being prepared.
The ST5 outbreak that was first noted in Calgary and area has also spread
to other parts of Alberta (particularly the city of Edmonton) and to
Vancouver, British Columbia. An increase in ST8 IPD was noted throughout
Alberta in 2005.
Since the introduction of PCV7, the incidence of vaccine-serotype IPD cases
in Calgary has declined in children under 2 years of age and in adults from
16 to 84 years of age. In addition, the proportion of all remaining IPD
cases caused by vaccine serotypes has declined at all ages. However, both
ST5 and ST8 are rare causes of IPD in children in our region and, with a
single exception, these serotypes are not colonizing children in our
region. Outbreaks of IPD have long been known to occur. There is no clear
relationship between the current serotype-specific outbreaks in adults and
childhood immunization programs.

[ProMED-mail thanks Professor Kellner for this authoritative report on the
serotype 5 _S. pnuemoniae_ outbreak in Alberta that preceded the one
recently reported from British Colombia, and also on an increase in type 8
disease. As in the BC situation, this outbreak is largely confined to an
indigent adult population and associated with alcohol and illicit drug use.
