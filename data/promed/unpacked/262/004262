[3] USA (New York): declining cases
Date: Fri 2 Sep 2022 17:30 EDT
Source: ABC 7 News [edited]
https://abc7chicago.com/monkeypox-cases-on-the-decline-in-the-nations-largest-city-data/12190981/


Monkeypox cases appear to be on the decline in the epicenter of the country's outbreak. Data from the New York City Department of Health & Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH) show that as of 30 Aug 2022, the latest date for which data are available, the Big Apple recorded a 7-day rolling average of 9 infections. That's an 82% decline from the 7-day rolling average of 50 recorded 2 weeks ago.

Since the outbreak began in mid-May [2022], no state -- or city -- has recorded more monkeypox cases than New York, so a drop in infections could be a prediction of what is to come for the rest of the country.

"The good news is monkeypox is declining," Dr. Roy Gulick, chief of the division of infectious diseases at Cornell University's Weill Medical College, told ABC News. "Globally it's declining and across the United States but being really led by the major cities and we've seen it right here in New York."

Even as the United States approaches 20 000 total infections, nationwide trends appear to show a drop, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). As of 31 Aug 2022, the 7-day rolling average of cases in the United States sits at 281, the lowest number recorded since 25 Jul 2022, according to an ABC News analysis of CDC data.

The outbreak has primarily been concentrated in men who have sex with men, a group that includes people who identify as gay, bisexual, transgender and nonbinary, although health officials have said anyone -- regardless of sexual orientation -- is at risk if they have direct contact with an infected patient.

Health experts say men who fall into this category have been likely doing a good job following doctors' advice in proper precautionary measures. A joint survey from the CDC, Emory University and Johns Hopkins University found that about one-half of gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men reduced their number of sexual partners, their number of one-time anonymous partners and reduced their use of dating apps.

"Health departments as well as community advocates and organizations have really gotten the word out about monkeypox," Gulick said. "Not only that it was something people needed to pay attention to, but also what to look for, what to do if you had lesions, when you should go see your doctor, and then how to avoid passing it to other people. Or if you didn't have it, how to avoid getting it in the first place." People at risk changed their behavior in response to the threat, he added.

On Thursday [28 Aug 2022], the NYC DOHMH announced it will begin making 2nd doses of the monkeypox vaccine available for those who received their 1st dose at least 10 weeks earlier. Walk-ins for 1st doses will also be accepted at city-run sites, a sign that scarcity of the vaccines is abating.

"Here in New York City, more than 70 000 monkeypox vaccines have been given, and recently there was a recommendation to split the dose -- make one dose into 5 doses -- and that strategy is also being rolled out, so more vaccines are available," Gulick said. "We did hear about waiting lists and long waits and trouble getting appointments initially for vaccines, but that really is not the case anymore."

However, Gulick added the outbreak isn't over and urged people in high-risk categories to keep taking precautions. "Although the numbers are encouraging because they're going down, there is still a risk," he said. "So, people who are at risk should absolutely seek out the vaccine, talk to their providers about whether they should get it or not and then people should be aware of contacts or changing their behavior to reduce the number of contacts that they have to avoid getting monkeypox."

[4] Spain: declining cases

New infections with monkeypox are steadily declining in Spain, which has recorded the world's 2nd-highest tally of cases in this year's [2022] global outbreak, Health Minister Carolina Darias said on Monday [5 Sep 2022]. "With all caution, we are in a stable period of decline of the disease and its transmission," she said after a meeting with health authorities from the Spanish regions.

Last week, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it was possible to eliminate monkeypox in Europe, citing evidence that the transmission of the disease, which the WHO has declared a global health emergency, is slowing in a handful of countries.

Spain has reported 6645 confirmed cases [6749, 2 fatal, on 6 Sep 2022] -- the highest tally in Europe and 2nd only after the United States globally -- and 2 deaths since it reported its 1st case in May [2022].

The country has acquired more than 17 000 doses of Bavarian Nordic's (BAVA.CO) Imvanex vaccine, the only one available in the market against monkeypox, and recently approved the so-called "dose-sparing" technique of vaccination, allowing up to 5 people to benefit from one vial.

[5] Myocarditis

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract
--------
A 31-year-old male patient with confirmed monkeypox infection developed acute myocarditis days after the eruption of skin lesions. Cardiac magnetic resonance study confirmed myocardial inflammation. The patient was treated with supportive care and had full clinical recovery. This case highlights cardiac involvement as a potential complication associated with monkeypox.

[This is the 1st report of possible myocarditis in a monkeypox (MPX) patient that ProMED has received. The above abstract mentions only that the myocardial inflammation occurred days after the eruption of skin lesions, but does not say how many days. It would be important for clinicians who treat MPX cases to be on the lookout for myocardial inflammation. - Mod.TY]

[6] Transmission model

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract
--------
The current global outbreak of monkeypox is a unique infectious disease in the way it seems to be transmitting: It has been observed to be highly concentrated in communities of men who have sex with men (MSM) through pair formation, and also provides immunity. This framework of mostly close, prolonged contact spreading a disease that admits immunity after infection is unlike similar infections which either offer little to no immunity post-infection or are lifelong infections. This creates the need for a new model framework that incorporates pair formation structure with recovery. While seemingly a straightforward model, we show how new dynamics arise from the combination of pair formation and recovery that are not present in a standard model with recovery and also not present in a pair formation model without recovery. We see that the combination of these 2 properties allows for waves of infection that are not seen in a standard SIR model. These dynamics suggest that outbreaks of monkeypox around the world may require special attention from public health. We also derive a reproduction number for this model and estimate the reproduction number of human monkeypox to be â2.3 using global and Canadian data. The expression derived for R0 can help estimate key parameters for disease transmission and public health interventions and compare to equivalent models without pair formation.
