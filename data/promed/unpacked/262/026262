Looking for solutions to the rice virus problem in the Mekong Delta
-------------------------------------------------------------------
In the last 2 years, rice production in Viet Nam, particularly in the
Mekong Delta, suffered a major setback when outbreaks of virus
diseases carried by the brown planthopper (BPH) caused a loss of
about 400 000 tons (or 1.1 percent of Viet Nam's total). Viet Nam's
rice exports were threatened and the infestations prompted officials
and farmers to spray insecticides in excess in attempts to curb the
spread of the viral infections, which, in turn, escalated to a high
usage of insecticides. There is also an imminent danger of the virus
problem spreading north and west from the current epicenter in the
Mekong Delta, which might affect rice production in Cambodia, Laos,
and central and northern Viet Nam. The virus has been reported in
Cambodia and in Nha Trang, about 400 km (248.5 mi) north of the
Delta. During this time, extensive outbreaks of BPH were also
reported in China, Korea, and Japan, causing yield losses of more
than 3 million tons of rice.
To focus on identifying research and implementation issues related to
management of the BPH/virus problem, the Australian Centre for
International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) is providing funds to
Vietnamese and IRRI scientists to undertake an 8-month project that
will review literature, historical data, and reports, and collect
preliminary data to scope for research and implementation issues,
provide some understanding of the vector-virus relationships, vector
migrations, and vector variability, and explore farmers' and
extension's perceptions of viral diseases and their management. This
information is needed for the development of an integrated management
of the BPH/virus problem to prevent its spread and to develop
communication management strategies to help farmers adapt.
The research team met at the Plant Protection Department (PPD) office
in Ho Chi Minh City on 30-31 May [2007] to develop detailed work
plans. After the intensive scoping study, a workshop will be
organized in early 2008 to report and advise on potential next steps
in research and implementation to manage the problem. The materials
gathered in the study will also be used to develop a full research
proposal on the management of BPH and the viruses.

[The Asian brown planthopper (_Nilaparvata lugens_) is one of the
worst pests of rice in the Australasian and Pacific Island region.
The specific virus diseases causing concern are not mentioned in this
report, however, _N. lugens_ is the vector of _Rice grassy stunt
virus_ (RGSV; genus _Tenuivirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_) and _Rice
ragged stunt virus_ (RRSV; genus _Oryzavirus_, family _Reoviridae_).
A number of other rice viruses are spread by the green planthopper
(_Nephotettix virescens_) including _Rice tungro bacilliform virus_
and _Rice tungro spherical virus_, which are both also present in
southern Viet Nam.
RGSV can also be transmitted by _N. bakeri_ and _N. muiri_. Rice
wilted stunt and rice rosette are at present considered to be strains
of RGSV. The virus causes severe stunting, excessive tillering, erect
growth habit, and reduced pale leaves on rice. Symptoms may be
confused with rice yellow dwarf and rice dwarf diseases. RGSV is
usually not a widespread problem but has been reported to cause
serious damage in limited areas during sporadic outbreaks. Other
virus species in the genus _Tenuivirus_ affecting the same host are
_Rice stripe virus_ and _Rice hoja blanca virus_, however their
insect vectors are different species of planthoppers.
RRSV causes stunting, enations on leaf veins and sheaths, ragged
leaves, and flower suppression. Yield losses of up to 90 percent have
been recorded depending of the percentage of plants infected. RRSV
can also infect barley and maize. Control measures include vector
control and the use of rice varieties resistant to the vector, the
virus, or both. Cultivars resistant to the vector have low disease
incidence.
Both RGSV and RRSV are transmitted by the vector insects in a
persistent manner, multiply in the vector, are retained during
moulting, but are not transmitted congenitally to the progeny of the
insects. Neither virus is transmitted by seed, pollen, or mechanical
means. Both viruses are spreading in large parts of the rice-growing
areas of Asia, and in tropical regions levels of infection and vector
density are often very high.
