Upon a read of the press release here, it seemed prudent to go to the
original journal publication referred to in the newswire, as it did seem
rather unusual to see a report of an outbreak of measles encephalopathy in
a population without a documented exposure to the disease, and during the
"off season" for high measles transmission.
The article referred to in the ProMED-mail posting on 1 Jul 2001 (Wairagkar
NS, Shaikh RK, Ratho RK, Ghosh D, Mahajan RC, Singhi S, Gadkari DA.
Isolation of measles virus from cerebrospinal fluid of children with acute
encephalopathy without rash. Indian Peds., 2001:38:589-595) can be found at:
<http://www.indianpediatrics.net/june2001/june-589-595.htm>
In this article, there is reference to another article describing the
original outbreak of encephalopathy from which the measles virus isolate
specimens were obtained (Ghosh D, Dhadwal D, Aggarwal A, Mitra S, Garg SK,
Kumar R, Kaur B. Investigation of an epidemic of Reye's syndrome in
northren region of India. Indian Peds., 1999: 36:1097-1106):
<http://www.indianpediatrics.net/june2001/june-589-595.htm>.
The press release gives a misinterpretation/representation of the
conclusions. It turns out that the outbreak was consistent with an outbreak
of Reye's syndrome and at the time of the original outbreak, they
identified association with both measles and varicella viruses. The
outbreak involved 129 cases (79 prospective available for study and an
additional 50 identified from records). The original outbreak mentions that
17/28 samples had IgM for measles in serum/CSF and 12/33 were positive for
varicella zoster virus. 6/19 blood samples were positive for salicylate,
while none gave a history of aspirin ingestion. The case fatality rate was
72% and use of salicylates was suggested as strongly associated with the
outbreak. Vaccination histories of the cases were not presented (it was
unclear if there was an attempt to obtain the vaccination histories).
The article referred to in the ProMED-mail posting goes through the
virology associated with the investigation of 28 of the patients in the
1997 outbreak of Reye's syndrome, concluding that measles virus was an
etiologic agent. In this article, it was indicated that the onset of the
Reye's syndrome encephalopathy occurred early in the febrile course of the
illness and in the absence of rash. Did a review of the literature focus on
the level of "asymptomatic" cases? The absence of a rash illness with
presence of antibodies against measles virus in the past has been referred
to as an asymptomatic case. Clearly there is a significant occurrence of
asymptomatic cases.
With clinical measles, the prodrome ranges in duration from 1-7 days,
during which fever is the predominant symptom. In the case descriptions
from the article under discussion, the majority of deaths occurred within 2
days of onset of encephalopathy, which was within 3 days of onset of fever.
Thus, death was within 5 days of onset of fever; still within the range of
prodrome preceding onset of rash. The article on the original outbreak
mentions the occurrence of the cases in early winter, before the usual
measles epidemic season (which begins in late winter/early spring). It is
important to highlight that the focus of the earlier article is the
outbreak of Reye's syndrome and not an outbreak of measles. There is no
mention in either article of measles incidence during the course of the year.
One should be cautious about linking this article with the Siliguri
outbreak. The Siliguri outbreak affected all age groups, not something one
would expect of measles virus in India, where high levels of vaccine
coverage have not been achieved for long enough to have a major impact on
the age distribution of cases. Additionally, most adults in India would be
immune to measles from prior infection during childhood. [In the prevaccine
era, sero-surveys demonstrated that by age 18, as high as 98 percent of
individuals had immunity to measles from natural infection. I shall be
happy to provide references to those readers who are interested upon
request - Mod.MPP
It is significant that the outbreak was primarily reported in a nursing
home, and deaths included 2 doctors and 4 nurses caring for the patients.
The ProMED-mail posting on 24 Mar 2001 (see refs. above) that discussed the
"mutant measles virus" put it in the context of another outbreak of measles
with serious cases of encephalitis in 1998 associated with vaccine
failures. One is reminded of the atypical measles syndrome seen in the USA
in individuals who were recipients of an earlier killed virus vaccine and
were then infected with the wild measles virus. While encephalitis was not
a predominant feature of atypical measles, one wonders if the vaccine
failures were due to injection of an attenuated measles virus that had been
killed by cold chain failures. In addition (and not unimportant) is the
fact that the Siliguri outbreak was not described as an encephalopathy with
hepatic failure (Reye's syndrome), while the cases described in this
article are consistent with a diagnosis of Reye's syndrome.
