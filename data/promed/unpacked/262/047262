Italy's pharmaceutical watchdog AIFA said on Monday [1 Dec 2014] that tests on an anti-flu vaccine that it suspended last week over health concerns had shown the drug was safe. AIFA on Thursday suspended 2 batches of the FLUAD vaccine made by Switzerland's Novartis, saying 3 deaths potentially connected to the drug had been reported. The suspension sparked widespread alarm in Italy, and 16 more deaths have been reported among people who had used the vaccine. However experts expressed skepticism that the deaths were linked to the drug, and health authorities urged people to continue to vaccinate themselves.

AIFA said in a joint statement issued with the health ministry that the tests on the suspended batches were "completely negative." It said reports of deaths linked to the vaccine presented by doctors or relatives should therefore be attributed to the heightened media attention on the issue, not to the drug. The statement noted that around 8000 Italians die of flu every year, and it urged people not to stop vaccinating, especially those over the age of 65.

Novartis said last week that more than 7 million doses of FLUAD had been distributed this year [2014] worldwide, and no unusual frequency of adverse effects had been reported. AIFA did not indicate whether it now planned to release the 2 batches of FLUAD it had suspended.

After last week partially banning Novartis' Fluad, Italian officials now say tests on the flu vaccine show the product is safe. The number of fatalities occurring shortly after Fluad vaccination in Italy grew from 3 to 19 within a few days after the country issued the ban, suspending batches 142701 and 143301. But "the results of the tests confirm the safety of the anti-flu vaccine," the Italian Medicines Agency said in a statement seen by Reuters. Tests on the batches in question came back "completely negative." As Novartis spokeswoman Liz Power told FierceVaccines, all Fluad batches have passed "extensive" analytical and safety testing and fulfill all required quality standards.

But this wasn't the 1st time Italy's officials had banned Fluad, approved in 1997. In October 2012, they suspended use of the shot -- along with the company's Agrippal, Influpozzi and adjuvanted Influpozzi -- on safety concerns after finding particles in vials.

It also wasn't the 1st time this year [2014] that Novartis' flu vaccines had hit Italy's radar. This summer, police alleged that the Basel-based drugmaker inflated the cost of an additive to 2 vaccines, multiplying it 6 times over and costing the country potentially upward of EUR 16 million (USD 22 million).

Of course, Novartis' flu lineup will soon be CSL's to worry about, thanks to a recent USD 275 million sale that, combined with an earlier, multibillion-dollar asset swap with GlaxoSmithKline, will help Novartis exit the vaccine arena completely.

And CSL has had its own recent safety issues to contend with: A study found that convulsions in children immunized with a flu shot from the Australian company in 2010 were caused by an excessive immune response to viral components in the vaccine, Bloomberg reports.

[In the absence of information on the reason or reasons for the conclusion that Fluad vaccine was not responsible for the deaths of 19 elderly patients in Italy, it would be prudent to avoid use of this vaccine pending further analysis. Perhaps only patients with specific co-morbidities were at risk, allowing the vaccine to remain in general use. More detailed information is awaited. - Mod.CP
