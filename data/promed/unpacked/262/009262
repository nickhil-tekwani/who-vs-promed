The strain of anthrax found on a Strafford County woman has been
determined to be the same as the one found on 2 drums used during a
drum circle the woman attended, state public health officials said
yesterday. DNA tests returned yesterday [31 Dec 2009] from the
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show 4 samples of
anthrax taken from the United Campus Ministry's Waysmeet Center in
Durham are all the same. One was found on an electrical outlet, 2
were found in drums used during the [4 Dec 2009] drumming circle, and
the last was taken from the woman's body.

The woman, whose name has not been released, was stricken with
gastrointestinal anthrax after taking part in the drumming circle,
according to Dr Elizabeth Talbot, an adviser to the state's public
health division. Authorities are still unsure if the woman. She
remains in critical condition in a Massachusetts hospital.

Talbot said of the 66 drums at the circle, about 56 have been tested.
She urged the remaining drum owners to contact the authorities to
arrange testing. She said investigators thought from the start the
woman contracted anthrax contained within a drum, possibly when
spores were suspended in the air through repeated banging. While
yesterday's [31 Dec 2009] tests confirmed part of their hypothesis,
one question still remains: Where did the anthrax come from? "Our
priority to date clearly has been protecting the public and making
sure there are no additional exposures," Talbot said.

Investigators are working to track down historical information about
the anthrax strain. "It does attest to how rare it is," Talbot said.

Talbot said the public is not in danger. Anthrax cannot be spread
between people.

Health officials are offering vaccines to dozens of other people who
passed through the campus ministry center, but none appears ill.
About half have already been contacted to discuss taking vaccines.
The remaining participants are being asked to call the state
Department of Health and Human Services. Vaccines consist of 3
injections over a 2-week period. "It is a personal choice made on a
case-by-case basis made with consultation with the patient and their
doctor," Talbot said.

Meanwhile, the Waysmeet Center is still under quarantine as federal
and state health agents determine the best way to clean the area.

[That all 4 isolates are the same simplifies the issues, but still
leaves open why she has g/e anthrax and not the pneumonic form. If
one argues that it might be dependent on the major particle size --
that is, optimum for the nasal turbinates and pharyngeal drainage --
why wasn't the actual drummer infected? I suspect he had a sufficient
exposure as it was probably his hand that contaminated the electrical
outlet. Could it be that repeated prior exposures had made him
immune? In fact, the more I think about this the more I think a
quasi-airborne route of infection can be rejected. If it were so, the
past history of outbreaks in mills, tanneries, and bone meal plants
would have shown similar cases in the past. They don't. Those cases
were limited to cutaneous and pneumonic forms of the disease. All of
which makes me, granted as an outsider a few thousand miles away from
New Hampshire, think that she got infected through some contaminated
food, such as, a sandwich placed on one of the drumheads or that had
been handled by the drummer.

The drummer or drummers for those 2 contaminated drum heads is/are
very lucky. Have they been bled for evidence of previous exposures
and the immunity from which protected them this time? Has someone
gone around to their apartment(s)/house(s) to check that they are not
dead -- a characteristic of g/e anthrax is that it can kill within
hours.

One must note that there are 10 more drums whose laboratory results
are still awaited. Also we are assuming that a drummer associated
with either of the known 2 contaminated drums contaminated the
electrical outlet. Did he? Or was it someone else?

That both drumheads were the same strain is not surprising if the raw
hides were purchased in the same street market in West Africa.
Unfortunately the genomics of West African _Bacillus anthracis_ are
essentially a closed book. There are very few properly located
isolates from that region in the various global collections. And
correcting that has proven to be difficult. These strains are not
"rare", they are merely little understood at this time. Elsewhere
there is enough information to locate genomic strains to most
probable locations (plural as they travel) even if a specific strain
has not been seen before.

I pray that this young person will make it through. - Mod.MHJ]
