Cases of the H5N8 strain of the bird flu have been confirmed in 226 farms in Hungary's southern Bacs-Kiskun and Csongrad counties, leading to the culling of 3.5 million animals, the chief veterinary officer said on Monday [27 Apr 2020].

In areas where farms stood too close to each other, 870 000 poultry had to be culled to thin the stock and stop the virus from spreading, Lajos Bognar said. The farmers' damage totals at several billion forints [one billion Hungarian forints = ca. USD 3 million], he said.

Facilities operating in line with the relevant regulations are eligible for damages from the state, Bognar said, adding that many have been found to flout a January [2020?] decree to keep the animals in closed facilities at all times.

Bognar noted that bird flu was typically brought into the country by migratory birds, hence the ban on open-air poultry farming.

H5N8 1st appeared in Asia in 2014, when it developed into a pandemic. It last appeared in Hungary in 2016-2017.

[HPAI H5N8 has been reported, since early 2020, from 4 European countries, namely Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary and Poland. Ongoing outbreaks are still present in Germany, Hungary and Poland, in poultry and/or non-poultry birds.

Hungary's main outbreak started 22 Mar 2020, affecting poultry farms in the southern province Bacs-Kiskun bordering Serbia. The most recent follow-up report, No. 4, reporting 53 new outbreaks, was submitted to the OIE on 21 Apr 2020 and is available, with map, at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=34083.

EU member countries are obliged to apply stamping-out policy in relation to HPAI H5N8; no vaccine is allowed.

Though HAPI H5N8 has not been found, so far, to cause human disease, this aspect requires continuous attention/followup to prevent surprises. See 20150523.338073 and 20171104.5419594. - Mod.AS
