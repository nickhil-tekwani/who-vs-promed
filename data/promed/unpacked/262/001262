Trichinellosis from imported meat, Denmark
------------------------------
7 cases of trichinellosis were diagnosed in people who had eaten
home-made sausage bought in Romania. The sausage was made from a
home-slaughtered pig. The patients developed periorbital edema after 3
weeks with diarrhoea, abdominal pains, and muscle pain. The patients had
elevated eosinophil counts and creatine kinase levels.
Contacts in Romania had been treated for trichinellosis after eating meat
from the same pig.

[Trichinellosis infection in meat imported from eastern Europe is
well-known. Until veterinary control of home-slaughtered animals is
commonly enforced, imported home-made food from these countries poses a
potential risk. Eosinophils are white blood cells whose numbers are often
elevated in helminthic infections, and elevated levels of the muscle enzyme
creatine kinase reflect the inflammatory response in the muscles. - Mod.EP]
