Environmental Protection minister Zeev Elkin announced on Thursday [23 Aug 2018] a plan to curb leishmaniasis, which has spread in Israel in the past 2 years. Elkin's office said that sandflies, which transmit the disease to humans, get the virus [sic] by stinging rock hyraxes who carry it.

Therefore, according to Hadashot [TV News], the ministry was dropping the hyrax from the list of protected animals for 3 years to enable authorities to decrease their numbers and contain the disease, which doesn't have a vaccine.

The Nature and Parks Authority and some in the Environmental Protection Ministry were said to have opposed the move, fearing the harm done to the animal would be too severe.

[For the leishmaniasis page of Israel's Ministry of Environmental Protection, including information and pictures of rock hyraxes (_Procavia capensis_), which serve as reservoir hosts for _Leishmania tropica_, one of the 2 causative agents of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Israel, please see http://www.sviva.gov.il/English/env_topics/Pest%20Control/Pages/Sand-Fly-and-Leishmania.aspx. Rock hyraxes are found in rocky areas of Judea, Samaria, and the Galilee (map included).

The step undertaken by the ministry, decided upon following further spread of the disease, has caused lively debate in Israel's media and social networks.

For an alternative approach to tackle the hyrax population dynamics, which is currently in early investigation phase, see http://campusteva.tau.ac.il/eng/content/new-research-system-zoological-garden-rock-hyraxes-and-leishmania-parasite.

A 2008 WHO review of Israel's leishmaniasis situation is available at http://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/resources/ISRAEL.pdf. Since 2008, cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis have increased their spread in the country. - Mod.AS

It is proposed to control the sandfly population by adding piperonyl to feeds for the Rock hyraxes instead of reducing the population of rock hyraxes. This strategy has two concerns: 1. to distribute the piperonyl tainted food pellets to the wild rock hyrax population, and 2. the piperonyl is not in itself an insecticide which kills the sandfly. Piperonyl inhibits enzymes in the sandfly (and mosquitoes) that break down other insecticides, for instance the pyrethroids. Thus piperonyl has little effect if there is no resistance to the pyrethroids. Data are also needed on the blood levels obtained after such haphazard administration (tainted food pellets). - Mod. EP
