Elephantiasis infections high in Bangkok
--------------------------------------------------------
Bangkok could face an outbreak of elephantiasis, the disfiguring
mosquito-borne disease that causes arms, legs, and genital organs to
swell to enormous proportions, a report said Sunday. A recent survey
of migrant workers by Thailand's Public Health Department showed an
unusually high percentage of the test cases carried the disease also
known as lymphatic filariasis, the Bangkok Post reported.
Health Department chief Krit Hiranus was quoted as saying that random
blood tests on 515 workers in Bangkok showed 26 people, or 5.05
percent, had elephantiasis, which can take years to manifest itself.
"That rate is dreadfully high," he reportedly said. "Even 1.0 percent
is higher than acceptable."
However, the number of patients being treated in Bangkok was still
low, because symptoms of the chronic disease, which remains something
of a mystery to scientists, can take as long as 5 years to emerge,
Krit added. The public health official told the Post that the workers
tested in the survey had been treated.
Elephantiasis puts at risk more than a billion people in 73 countries,
with more than 120 million already affected by it, 43 million of them
seriously, according to a 1998 study by the World Health Organisation
(WHO).
A third of the people infected with the disease live in India while
another third are in Africa and most of the remaining third are in
Southeast Asia, the Pacific and the Americas. The disease, which is
spreading in sub-tropical regions, is transmitted by mosquitos
carrying parasitic worms that lodge in the human lymphatic system.
Elephantiasis can result in the swelling of arms, legs, and genitals
to several times their normal size, comparable to those of an
elephant. Drug treatments to kill the parasite that leads to the
disease have been the subject of a long-term worldwide campaign
launched in 1998 by the WHO and British drug maker SmithKline Beecham
Plc to eradicate the disease.

[Lymphatic filariasis is endemic in Thailand, and assessment by WHO of
the national control programme shows several constraints: low coverage
in mass chemotherapy due to side effects of DEC, and gaps in the
knowledge of the possibility of a zoonotic reservoir, among others.
