As of 15 Dec [2006], the Ministry of Health Togo has reported 3 cases
of yellow fever (males, ages 9, 15 and 20 years) from the region of
Savanes and Kara (see previous report [cited in ProMED Archive
No.20061219.3568]). All cases are alive and were laboratory-confirmed
by the Institute Pasteur in Dakar.
To avoid further spread, an initial joint Ministry of Health/WHO
country office investigation, sent to the field, advised a
vaccination campaign in response to the outbreak.
A mass vaccination campaign will be carried out in the affected
regions with 1 550 000 vaccines doses from the Global Alliance for
Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) Emergency Stockpile. The vaccination
campaign will be conducted with the support of WHO, European
Commission Humanitarian Aid Department (ECHO) and UNICEF.

[This report, confirming yellow fever virus etiology of the 3 cases
reported in the 19 Dec 2006 report of yellow fever in Togo, is of
interest. The ProMED comments made in that report still apply,
perhaps more so given that apparently the yellow fever vaccination
campaign has not yet started, i.e. "Togo has a population of 5.4
million. Rapidly immunizing this number, or even a small subset in
the areas where the cases occurred, will not be easy or inexpensive."
Neither this WHO EPR report nor the previously cited one (in Archive
No. 20061219.3568) comments on the vector situation in Togo, nor what
vector control measures are being implemented. ProMED will appreciate
receiving updates on this situation.
