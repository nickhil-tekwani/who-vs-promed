Jacobu, the capital of Amansie Central District in the Ashanti Region, was hit by a food poisoning scare at the weekend [14-15 Sep 2013] when scores of people, including journalists, chiefs, and policemen, were taken ill after eating at a reception held at the end of a program organized by the district assembly to endorse the new District Chief Executive (DCE).

Eyewitnesses said there was a lot to eat at the reception, with some of the guests carrying excess food in packs to their homes. In a chain reaction, they suffered symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea and were rushed to various health facilities for treatment in Kumasi, Bekwai, and Obuasi. Among those from Kumasi were reporters with some radio stations. One of them gave some of the food to the wife to eat and minutes later, she started vomiting and defecating and the 2 were taken to hospital.

No deaths have occurred but a distraught DCE, Mr Emmanuel Dede-Appiah, told the Daily Graphic last Saturday night, 14 Sep 2013, that at least 60 people were taken to the district hospital and a private clinic at Jacobu. "It's terrible. Even the chief of my town is a victim but I thank God that no one has lost his or her life," the DCE said.

A source at the Jacobu Police also said 7 policemen who took the meal also fell ill and were rushed to the local hospital for treatment. It said the police were investigating the incident.

A health official at the Jacobu hospital, confirming the situation in a telephone interview with the Daily Graphic, said medical officers worked hard on the victims to save lives. Health authorities at Jacobu were testing samples of the food eaten and the stool of victims to detect what caused the near calamity. But the DCE said the victims appeared to have eaten jollof with shito [see details below].

According to Mr Dede-Appiah, those who ate other dishes including tuo-zaafi, fufu, and banku did not complain of any complications. The DCE said the food served at the reception was from 3 sources. Some of it was prepared by his wife, with the rest coming from the district assembly and a private caterer at Obuasi. "But for now, I don't know where the jollof and shito came from, " he added.

[Jollof rice (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jollof_rice) , also called 'Benachin' meaning one pot in the Wolof language, is a popular dish in many parts of West Africa. It is thought to have originated amongst members of the Wolof ethnic group in the Senegambia region but has since spread to the whole of West Africa, especially Nigeria, Togo, Ghana, Sierra Leone, and Liberia. There are many variations of jollof rice. The most common basic ingredients are rice, tomatoes, and tomato paste, onion, salt, and red pepper. Beyond that, nearly any kind of meat, vegetable, or spice can be added.

Shitor Din (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shito), commonly called Shito is the word for pepper in the Ghanaian native language (Ga) of the capital Accra. Whilst the word for pepper is different for each of the Ghanaian native languages, the word 'Shito' is widely used as the name for the hot black pepper sauce ubiquitous in Ghanaian cuisine. Shito sauce consists primarily of fish oil and/or palm oil, ginger, dried fish, prawns and/or crustaceans, tomatoes, garlic, peppers, and spices. The blend of spices and fish differs between different regions and villages.

The key description in the posting is that symptoms occurred within minutes of ingestion. Heavy metal such as tin and copper which can contaminate food or water stored in metal containers can cause immediate vomiting but not usually diarrhea. Whether this was a deliberate poisoning is unclear. - Mod.LL

ProMED would be interested to know the causative agent. A series of pictures of delicious-looking jollof rice dishes can be seen at:
