A single case of listeriosis in an elderly gentleman in Kansas City, MO, in
December, has led to an international recall of 10oz "Oscar Mayer All
American Variety Pack" and 6 oz "Oscar Mayer Club Sandwich Variety Pack."
The packages have a January 12th date in the upper left corner on the back
of the package and bear "EST 537A" or "P-1449" in the USDA inspection mark.
The products were sliced and packaged on 10/29/98 and were distributed
throughout the US, Singapore, Bermuda, Aruba, St. Martin, the Dominican
Republic, and Puerto Rico.
The man's infection was not fatal and, to date, a pregnant relative who ate
from the same contaminated meat package remains well. Kansas City has only
recorded 8 cases of listeriosis among its 450,000 residents since 1990, two
in 1998, all in the elderly.

[I presume this case of listeriosis to be the one referred to in the prior
posting titled ... - USA (Wisconsin) as cited above. It might be useful to
have some comments from those involved concerning the rationale for meat
recalls of this magnitude in response to single isolates of _Listeria_ from
meat products, or small numbers of cases. Is zero tolerance for _Listeria_
contamination of meat products practical? - Mod.ES
