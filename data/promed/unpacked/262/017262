-----------------------------------------------
Potato (_Solanum tuberosum_ L.) is an important crop in China. In 2013, diseased potatoes exhibiting blackleg and soft rot symptoms were found in the winter potato growing areas of Huizhou city, Guangdong Province, with an incidence of approximately 20 percent. Initially, the stem bases of infected plants blackened, and this symptom spread upward. Later, foliage of the diseased plants became yellow, and the stem rotted with vascular discoloration.

20 diseased plants with typical black leg symptoms were collected from a 10 hectare potato field with approximately 60 000 plants per hectare. A bacterium with small, irregular round, fluidal, white colonies was isolated from the vascular tissue of all diseased plants. Ten strains were randomly selected for pathogenicity assays. Potato plants at the 5- to 6-leaf stage were inoculated and exhibited the same symptoms as the diseased potato plants in the field 3-5 days later. The bacterium was re-isolated from diseased tissue.

Using a universal bacterial 16S rDNA primer set, 1400 bp fragments were amplified from the 10 strains. The sequences were identical and had 100 percent sequence identity with 16S rDNA of _Pectobacterium atrosepticum_ CFBP 1526 (GenBank accession JN600332). Further, the 438 bp and 690 bp fragments were respectively amplified from all 10 strains with _Pectobacterium atrosepticum_-specific primers.

To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of potato blackleg disease caused by _Pectobacterium atrosepticum_ in Guangdong province.

[Blackleg of potato can be caused by _Pectobacterium atrosepticum_ (previously _Erwinia carotovora_ subsp. _atroseptica_), as well as the recently emerged, more virulent new species _Dickeya solani_ (ProMED-mail post 20091207.4162). Symptoms of blackleg on potato may include stem rot leading to leaf yellowing, wilting and stunting of plants, as well as tuber rot, which usually starts at the stem end of the tuber.

The bacteria are spread with contaminated plant or other material (including seed tubers), by mechanical means, and water. Disease management may include seed tuber handling and cultural techniques, use of clean planting material, and phytosanitation to prevent introduction of the pathogen from external sources. Low levels of seed tuber infection pose a major risk of pathogen spread, and certification schemes are a vital part of disease management for these pathogens.

Blackleg appears to have been reported from other parts of China earlier (see link below) and may have been brought into Guangdong from there. It is not clear whether a national certification scheme for seed potatoes is implemented in the country.

_Pectobacterium_ and _Dickeya_ species or subspecies also cause bacterial soft rot of potato. The pathogens can also affect other crops, causing, for example, a foot rot disease in rice as well as stem and root rot of sweet potato.
