Illinois, 2000: 2 Fatal Cases of Adenovirus-Related Illness in Previously
Healthy Young Adults
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adenoviruses are common pathogens that often are associated with
respiratory and gastrointestinal illness and/or conjunctivitis in young
persons. Adenovirus serotypes 4 and 7 have caused outbreaks of self-limited
febrile respiratory illness in young adults in basic military training.
During the 1950s and 1960s, up to 10% of recruits were infected with
adenovirus, and these pathogens were responsible for approximately 90% of
pneumonia hospitalizations (1).
Beginning in 1971, all military recruits received oral, live,
enteric-coated vaccines that were licensed by the Food and Drug
Administration as safe and effective in preventing illness from adenovirus
serotypes 4 and 7. In 1996, the sole manufacturer ceased production of
adenoviral vaccines and, as supplies dwindled during the next few years,
outbreaks of adenoviral respiratory illness reemerged in military settings (2).
Since 1999, approximately 10%--12% of all recruits have become ill with
adenovirus infection in basic training, similar to the prevaccine era. This
report describes the first 2 deaths probably associated with adenovirus
infection identified in military recruits since the vaccines became
unavailable. The military has requested proposals for a new adenovirus
vaccine manufacturer; however, these deaths suggest that efforts by
policymakers and pharmaceutical companies to reestablish adenoviral vaccine
production should be intensified.
Case Report 1
A healthy 21-year-old man arrived at Navy basic training in Great Lakes,
Illinois, on 19 May 2000. His medical history was negative for underlying
illnesses. He took no medications and denied alcohol or tobacco use. Within
one week of arrival, he received several standard vaccinations, including
meningococcal vaccine. On 20 to 23 Jun 2000, he presented to the medical
clinic with upper respiratory symptoms. His clinical evaluations did not
suggest severe illness, and 2 bacterial throat cultures were negative. On
23 Jun 2000, he was prescribed a 5-day course of azithromycin for suspected
bronchitis. On 24 Jun 2000, he was found unconscious in the barracks. He
was transported to a local hospital where he had tonic clonic seizures and
respiratory failure that required a ventilator. A chest radiograph revealed
a right upper lobe infiltrate, and computer tomography of the head was
positive for sinusitis. Examination of cerebrospinal fluid revealed
elevated protein levels, but no identifiable pathogens. Blood cultures were
negative. He was treated with broad-spectrum antibacterial agents (i.e.,
vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole) and antivirals (i.e., acyclovir
and foscarnet). He did not regain consciousness and he died on 3 Jul 2000
from complications of encephalitis.
Autopsy findings included histologic changes in the brain and spinal cord
consistent with viral encephalitis. Both lungs showed bronchiolitis
obliterans and organizing pneumonia. Cultures, special stains, and electron
microscopy of autopsy specimens did not identify specific pathogens.
Molecular testing by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay of lung and
brain tissue was positive for adenovirus DNA using multiple primer sets
(3,4). Analysis of premorbid and postmortem serum specimens showed a
greater than fourfold rise in neutralizing antibody titers to both
adenovirus types 4 and 7.
Case Report 2
A healthy 18-year-old man arrived at Navy basic training in Great Lakes,
Illinois, on 1 Aug 2000. He took no medication and did not use tobacco
products. Within one week of arrival, he received several standard
vaccinations and benzathine penicillin G (1.2 mu intramuscularly) as
prophylaxis for group A streptococcal infections. On 17 and 29 Aug and 17
Sep 2000, he presented to the medical clinic with upper respiratory
symptoms. Examinations disclosed no severe illness; he was given
acetaminophen and decongestants. On 8 Sep 2000, he presented to the medical
clinic with severe dyspnea, weakness, and a petechial rash on the legs. A
chest radiograph identified multilobar infiltrates, and he was admitted to
a local hospital where his condition rapidly deteriorated. He was given
intravenous ceftriaxone and erythromycin and respiratory and hemodynamic
support. He died 9 hours after admission with a clinical diagnosis of acute
respiratory distress syndrome.
A culture of expectorated sputum collected on the day of admission was
later positive for group A streptococcus. An autopsy revealed diffuse
hemorrhagic pneumonia and diffuse alveolar injury. Cultures and special
stains of autopsy materials failed to identify specific pathogens. Electron
microscopy indicated intracellular cocci in leukocytes of the lung tissue;
no viruses were identified. PCR testing of lung tissue was positive for
adenovirus DNA at 2 laboratories using multiple primer sets (3,4).
Serologic studies were not performed.

MMWR Editorial Note:
These cases illustrate that severe morbidity and mortality are possible
from adenovirus infections in previously healthy young adults. Serious
adenoviral infections were reported in the U.S. military before vaccines
were developed (5) and in unvaccinated civilians (6,7). In 1996, disease
surveillance was established in response to impending loss of vaccine in
the military.
Case 1 demonstrates the rare manifestation of central nervous system
involvement by adenovirus. Although the serotype is impossible to identify,
serotype 7 has been associated most commonly with meningitis and
encephalitis (8). Surveillance has shown serotype 7 adenovirus as a
pathogen identified among the approximately 30 new cases of respiratory
illness seen at this training site each week (2); the number of cases of
illness was slightly higher when the case 1 recruit was in training.
Because the pathogen was not detected until postmortem examination, case 2
may have been an occult adenovirus infection. The clinical course met the
criteria for probable streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, with hypotension,
rash, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and group A streptococcus
isolated from a non-sterile site (9). Adenovirus may not have been the
primary source of illness but a co-morbidity factor (10).
In both cases, the postmortem diagnosis of adenovirus was made on limited
evidence; PCR and serology indicated the presence of adenoviruses in case
1, and PCR alone was the basis for adenoviral detection in case 2.
Isolating adenovirus in culture would have been stronger evidence of
infection, but negative culture results can be expected when only
postmortem specimens are available. The lack of adenovirus changes on
electron microscopy may have been the result of the low sensitivity of this
technique on limited tissue samples. Despite these limitations, the viral
changes on autopsy, lack of identification of other viral pathogens, and
PCR evidence support the diagnoses of adenovirus-related illnesses.
These are the first 2 deaths probably associated with adenovirus infection
in the U.S. military since 1972. Until vaccines become available again,
support should be given to ongoing surveillance efforts with appropriate
laboratory techniques to identify adenoviral infections. Approximately 200
000 young persons begin U.S. military enlisted careers each year;
therefore, clinicians should consider adenovirus infection in severely ill
young persons in the military. Policymakers and pharmaceutical companies
should consider reestablishing adenovirus vaccine production.
