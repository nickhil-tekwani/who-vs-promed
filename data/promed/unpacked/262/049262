HEPATITIS B & C AND SUBDERMAL ELECTRODES (7)
============================================
I have found the information that was provided on re-usable
sub-dermal electrodes and the transmission of HBV and HCV to be
very useful. As I exhaust the possible means of transmission, I
have come across some theoretical concerns regarding the
transmission of HBV and aggressive manicure/pedicure. This
question comes as we are trying to develop Public Health guidelines
for "Salons". Much appreciated if anyone has heard of this as a
real issue or has read literature on it. Thanks again.
