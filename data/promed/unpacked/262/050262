Seven poultry farms in Rangoon's neighboring townships have been hit
by outbreaks of the H5N1 virus since February 2007 leading to the
culling of 65 812 birds, Sunday dailies reported.
According to laboratory tests, 24 samples out of 675 samples from the
affected farms were infected, while the virus was also detected in 6
samples of the dead crows out of 561 samples taken of wild birds,
reported The New Light of Myanmar.
The cullings and sample tests have been conducted in cooperation with
the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and US Agency for
International Development, between 6 Mar and 21 Apr 2007.
Restrictions on transport and sale of poultry and poultry products in
the 5 townships has since been lifted.
The government has requested the people and breeders to come forward
with information on the dead birds, to ensure bio-security and
cooperate with the department in order to be able to prevent the
recurrence of bird flu.

[An infection rate of 3.5 percent (24/675) in HPAI-affected farms
seems exceptionally low, unless the sampling was carried out during
the very early stages of the outbreak (preceding culling?).
Clarification will help. - Mod.AS]

Kuwait reports new case of bird flu in ostrich
-----------------------------------------------
Kuwait said on Sunday [22 Apr 2007] it has found a new case of the
deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu in the south of the Gulf Arab state
near the Saudi border.
"We now have 46 infected focal points after the latest finding in an
ostrich in Wafra," said health ministry spokesman Ahmed al-Shatti.
"We no longer count individual cases. We concentrate on focal points
or areas where the disease has been found, like farms, domestic cages
or pens," he added.
On 2 Apr 2007, Kuwait said the number of individual bird flu cases
found in falcons, chicken and quails was 106.
Kuwait has culled around 1.7 million birds, banned import of live
birds, closed down the country's zoo as well as poultry shops in
residential areas since the 1st case was reported this year in February 2007.
Kuwaiti news agency KUNA said earlier in April 2007 that poultry
sales have fallen around 40 percent since the outbreak of the disease.
In 2005, Kuwait reported a case of bird flu in a flamingo.

[Kuwait's last follow-up report, including a map of the recorded
outbreaks at that date, was submitted to the OIE on 14 Mar 2007; see
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=5024>.
The disease has been officially reported during 2007 from 19
countries, including the Middle-Eastern countries Saudi Arabia and
Turkey, while human cases have been reported from Egypt. However,
Egypt's last update on its animal-disease situation dates back to
March 2006. Rumors on HPAI occurrence in Iran remain to be confirmed
or otherwise. - Mod.AS]
