This is probably off the topic, but I think it's an important point. A
couple of recent submissions, one on this thread (I can't recall the other)
have implied that a well adapted pathogen will not kill its host. This is, I
feel, something of an overstatement of the case.
Pathogens often cause a very high mortality in new hosts that will
subsequently decline, but whether sufficient adaptive pressure exists to
drive mortality to zero in all cases is something I very much doubt.
Certainly, a well adapted pathogen will not kill its host before
transmission to fresh hosts can occur, but there are many examples of often
fatal but well transmitted pathogens that appear to be in equilibrium with
their host population. Even in the case of HIV (which is not in
equilibrium), the long timespan between infection and eventual death means
that virus transmission to new hosts is hardly limited at all by the very
high mortality.

[The traditional rapid lethality is of a pathogen in its non-reservoire
host, when it kills ... there is also the reverse situation when the
non-normal host is totally resistant. Here in southern Louisiana some 30% of
the adult nine-banded armadillo's are infected with Mycobacterium leprae
which does kill them but it takes about two years to do so by which time the
adult female will have had two litters of four identical young each time.
Bacillus anthracis survives by killing its host rapidly (the minimum natural
incubation period is 9 hours) because by so doing it obtains massive
multiplication and sporulation; in the right circumstances the spore can
survive to infect and kill another day and that can occasionally be delayed
for decades. Both are "well adapted". AHEAD-Mod MHJ
