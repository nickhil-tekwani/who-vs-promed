Has anyone looked into the possibility of these deaths being related
to the drinking of cobra blood/venom mix, something which is not
uncommon for tourists in that part of the world? I believe the drink
has been noted to contain a serious cardiotoxin on some occasions.

[Snake blood wine, snake bile wine, and snake venom wine are all
variations of mixing various parts of snakes, generally toxic snakes,
with rice wine. Sometimes the rice wine is poured over one or more
snakes, and this concoction is left to ferment. Drinking one of these
drinks is supposed to give the consumer stronger hair and nails,
smoother skin, nicer teeth, and a host of other positive advantages.

It also seems to be somewhat common to agitate a cobra, kill it, and
serve the heart to the honored guest or paying recipient. Allegedly,
the heart will beat for up to 20 minutes until the stomach acid of the
imbiber stills the beating heart. I cannot imagine how the heart could
continue to beat for that long, and more likely it is the adrenalin
rush of the consumer that continues for some length of time. The
agitation of the snake likely builds up adrenalin and is possibly the
source of the alleged potency of this type of drink.

Supposedly, this ritual is designed to give the consumer great
potency, and the aphrodisiacal properties allegedly last 36 to 40
hours (eat your heart out Viagra) in males and supposedly something
similar in females.

The stomach acid of the snakes is denatured, as is any protein, by
the acids within the stomach. Supposedly, only those with erosions of
the esophagus, gastric ulcers and cuts in the mouth and on the tongue
(piercings?) are subject to potential poisoning by the venom wine.

Did all of the victims have some sort of portal of entry for the
venom if they were involved in drinking this wine? Without a thorough
autopsy report to verify erosions or other breaches of the skin, this
seems an unlikely route for inducing a death from toxin. - Mod.TG]

[This just in from David E. Starling, D.V.M. Ames, Iowa, USA:

"[Case A] ate a chicken pita kebab, and [cases B &C] ate red pork
curry. Both [cases A & C -- C died] drank a passion-fruit shake. Later
at the hotel, we drank the bottled drinking water provided for us." So
no history of snake- or mushroom-derived food.
