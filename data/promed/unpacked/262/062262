SCRUB TYPHUS - DENMARK EX SOUTH AFRICA

Three 10th grade classes with a total of 50 pupils and five teachers were
on a short school trip to Durban, South Africa, at the end of October. They
spent two nights in huts, or outdoors in some cases. After returning home,
14 of the pupils developed fever, 11 had one or more characteristic small,
black cutaneous sores (eschars), and a few had a rash compatible with
typhus. The disease is a rickettsiosis (probably due to _Rickettsia
africae_) transmitted by ticks not unlike our own ticks. It so happens that
several tick bites are often found in the South African form of the
disease, while the maculopapular rash may be absent. The illness usually
produces fever and headache, but seldom serious complications. The
incubation period is about one week. Diagnosis is based on clinical and
serological findings, and treatment is with tetracycline. With the increase
in tourism to South Africa, a rising number of such cases may be expected
to be imported into Denmark. Person-to-person transmission does not occur.
