Highlights
----------
- There have been 20 206 reported cases of Ebola virus disease [EVD], with 7905 reported deaths.
- Reported case incidence is fluctuating in Guinea and decreasing in Liberia, although Liberia reported more cases in the week ending 28 Dec 2014 than in the previous week.
- There are signs that the increase in incidence has slowed in Sierra Leone. However, the west of the country is still experiencing the most intense transmission of all affected countries.
- The United Kingdom has reported its 1st confirmed case of Ebola.

- Not reported due to the high proportion of probable and suspected cases that are reclassified.
- Data not available.]

1. Countries with Widespread and Intense Transmission
-----------------------------------------------------
A total of 20 171 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD and 7890 deaths have been reported up to the end of 28 Dec 2014 by the Ministries of Health of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone (table 1). The data are reported through WHO country offices.

Taking into account the number of cases as a proportion of an affected country's population, there have been 25 reported cases and 16 reported deaths per 100 000 population in Guinea, 203 cases and 86 deaths per 100 000 population in Liberia, and 164 cases and 48 deaths per 100 000 population in Sierra Leone.

[Table 2 in source.]

A stratified analysis of cumulative confirmed and probable cases indicates that the number of cases in males and females is about the same. There have been 74 reported cases per 100 000 population in males, compared with 76 per 100 000 population in females (Table 2).

Compared with children, people aged 15 to 44 are 3 times more likely to be affected (33 reported cases per 100 000 population, compared with 96 per 100 000 population). People aged 45 and over (122 reported cases per 100 000 population) are almost 4 times more likely to be affected as children.

[3] Region: IV [intravenous] therapy in Africa
Date: Thu 1 Jan 2015

http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/02/health/ebola-doctors-are-divided-on-iv-therapy-in-africa.html


Ebola Doctors Are Divided on IV Therapy in Africa
-------------------------------------------------
Medical experts seeking to stem the Ebola epidemic are sharply divided over whether most patients in West Africa should, or can, be given intravenous hydration, a therapy that is standard [with the few Ebola patients treated in developed countries]. Some argue that more aggressive treatment with IV fluids is medically possible and a moral obligation. But others counsel caution, saying that pushing too hard would put overworked doctors and nurses in danger and that the treatment, if given carelessly, could even kill patients.

The debate comes at a crucial time in the outbreak. New infections are flattening out in most places, better-equipped field hospitals are opening, and more trained professionals are arriving. Every hospital there should have "early, liberal use of intravenous fluid and electrolyte replacement," said Dr. Robert A. Fowler, a Canadian critical care specialist who leads a WHO Ebola team.

Experts who favor aggressive rehydration point to several hospitals that claim unusually low death rates as evidence that it is effective. Skeptics say other factors may be at work. "MSF is not doing enough," said Dr. Paul Farmer, one of the founders of Partners in Health, using the French initials for Doctors Without Borders, whose staff members have worked on the front lines of Ebola outbreaks for years. "What if the fatality rate isn't the virulence of disease but the mediocrity of the medical delivery?"

Doctors Without Borders representatives strongly disagreed, saying that Dr. Farmer's assumptions about Ebola were incorrect, that intensive rehydration would probably not save as many patients as he believes, and that the WHO's position has not been proved. The group's overwhelmed doctors do what they can, officials said, but it is hard to insert needles while wearing 3 pairs of gloves and foggy goggles. IVs must be monitored, drawing virus-laden blood for tests is dangerous, and patients yank needles out -- sometimes in delirium, sometimes just to go to the toilet when no nurse is around. ... -- more

[4] USA: Ebola Aid Workers Still Avoiding New York and New Jersey, USA
Date: Thu 1 Jan 2015
Source: NPR [edited]
http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2015/01/01/374194902/ebola-aid-workers-still-avoiding-new-york-and-new-jersey


State officials in New Jersey (NJ) and New York (NY) explain the [Ebola quarantine] rules as: A health care worker who treated Ebola patients can serve his/her mandatory quarantine at home in NJ or in NY. If you don't live in those 2 states -- and you have no symptoms that suggest you might have Ebola -- you will be allowed to pass through the airport, and return to wherever you live.

But some international aid groups "don't want people to be quarantined unnecessarily," says Margaret Aguirre of International Medical Corps, based in Los Angeles [California]. Her group has been telling returning health care workers to avoid JFK [in NY] and Newark [in NJ] airports.

The International Medical Corps isn't the only aid group that's been avoiding New York and New Jersey, travel-wise. "We're having to make sure that our people coming back from Liberia don't go through those 2 states," says Franklin Graham, president of Samaritan's Purse. "We've got to bring them in some other way -- get them into Washington through Dulles [in Virginia], or Atlanta [Georgia], someplace like that."

Other states and municipalities have adopted a patchwork of regulations; many of these rules go beyond what's recommended by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC says most returning health care workers should monitor themselves for 21 days -- but they don't need to be isolated unless they start showing symptoms. ... -- more

[5] UN: Outgoing head of UN Ebola mission sums up progress in 'big battle' with outbreak
Date: Fri 2 Jan 2015
Source: UN News Centre [edited]
http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=49726


Outgoing head of the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER), Anthony Banbury today [2 Jan 2015] pointed to significant progress in tackling the outbreak since he was appointed in September last year [2014], while stressing that zero cases is the only acceptable outcome in the "big battle" with the disease.

As Mr. Banbury prepares to hand over the reins of UNMEER to Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed on Saturday [3 Jan 2015], he was able to point to the latest World Health Organization (WHO) report on the epidemic, which counted 20 206 confirmed, probable or suspected cases of Ebola and 7905 reported deaths [instead of 1.4 million as predicted in September 2014].

His last trip to review progress in the 3 most affected countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone revealed an increased number of isolation beds in all 3 countries, with 2 beds per patient in Guinea, 3.5 in Sierra Leone, and 14 in Liberia.

With support from UNMEER and other partners, all 3 countries also have capacity sufficient to isolate and treat 100 per cent of confirmed Ebola patients and enough burial teams to ensure safe and dignified burials for 100 per cent of all deaths due to the disease.

Despite the progress, Mr. Banbury said several challenges remain, including the geographical dispersion of Ebola. There was also a need to change community behaviours and reduce resistance to the massive interventions attempted. "We are engaged in a big battle with this disease," he said. "It's an insidious, invasive disease that attacks people through acts of caring and kindness. ... It's going to be extremely hard for us to bring it down to zero but that is what we will do. That is the only acceptable outcome." ... -- more

[6] Asia: Where could Ebola strike next? Scientists virus hunt in Asia
Date: Fri 2 Jan 2015
Source: NPR [edited]
http://www.npr.org/blogs/goatsandsoda/2015/01/02/371994171/where-could-ebola-strike-next-scientists-virus-hunt-in-asia


Ecologist David Hayman, then a graduate student at the University of Cambridge, spent time in the rain forest of Ghana, catching hundreds of fruit bats, to collect sera, since bats carry a huge number of viruses in their blood. When Hayman took the blood samples back to the lab, some of the sera had antibodies against Ebola Zaire. The antibodies in the bat's blood meant the animals had once been infected with Ebola Zaire or something related to it. Hayman and his colleagues published the findings in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. That was July 2012, over 2 years ago. Now, it is thought that bats likely triggered the entire Ebola epidemic in West Africa.

Ecologist Kevin Olival, at EcoHealth Alliance in New York City, while studying another viral outbreak, had found bats in Bangladesh with antibodies to something related to Ebola Zaire. Olival and his colleagues published these findings in Feb 2013. Then a few months later, another team reported evidence of the virus in China. The bats with these antibodies have a broad range, across south Asia Olival says. "These species are found all the way down into parts of Indonesia." The data suggest that Ebola Zaire, or something to which it is related, is far more widespread around the world than previously thought. "Now, there's no sign bats have infected people in Asia with Ebola Zaire. And antibody tests can't say if the virus in the bats was specifically Ebola Zaire or something related." ... -- more

[7] Africa: A history of Ebola in 24 outbreaks
Date: Mon 29 Dec 2014
Source: New York Times [edited]
http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/30/science/history-of-ebola-in-24-outbreaks.html


The continuing Ebola outbreak in West Africa has infected 8 times the number of people than all previous outbreaks combined. A review of the 2 dozen recorded human outbreaks across Africa suggests some common themes.

1976: Workers at a cotton factory in Nzara, Sudan were infected from an unknown source, possibly roosting bats. The outbreak spread to nearby towns and through a hospital. This was the earliest known outbreak of the Ebola virus, but because of delays in recognizing the outbreak it was not the 1st international response.

The Ebola reservoir is the forest: The Ebola virus lives in the deep equatorial forests of Central Africa, and can infect people who live, hunt or work in the forest or on its fringes. The Forest Region of Guinea, where the current outbreak began, had had no known outbreaks. But it is one of several areas in Africa thought to have the right combination of forest, bats, temperature and other environmental conditions to possibly harbor the Ebola virus.

Ebola moves from animals to humans: Ebola kills apes, monkeys and humans. But the virus needs a more tolerant host, probably bats, to survive over long periods. Contaminated bats can carry the virus across rivers and borders and can infect animals who touch their blood or eat fruit they have gnawed on. At least 10, and probably most, of the 24 outbreaks across Africa began with a person touching the blood or meat of an infected ape, monkey, bat or other animal killed for bush meat.

Ebola outbreaks enlarge on delayed diagnosis: Before the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa, there were 8 previous outbreaks with more than 100 cases. It took an average of 2 months for each of the 8 previous large outbreaks to be recognized and investigated. After each outbreak was announced, it took an average of 3 weeks to mount an international response. Small, contained outbreaks of Ebola are relatively easy to stop, but long delays in recognizing an outbreak allow chains of infection to continue unbroken.

Ebola travels, sometimes by road: Most Ebola outbreaks begin in remote forested areas. For the virus to leave the forest and travel long distances in humans, it must go by road or river. Where people have access to motorcycles, taxis or buses, Ebola tends to spread from village to village along roads. Roadblocks are usually thought to be ineffective, because people can bribe their way through or find alternate routes.

Ebola strikes unprepared hospitals: Hospitals and clinics are the best places to recognize Ebola. But unprepared hospitals can concentrate and amplify an outbreak. At least 11 of the 24 outbreaks have spread through hospitals or clinics, often decimating medical staff.

Ebola benefits from super-spreader events: At least 5 "super-spreader" events have been documented in the history of Ebola. These events typically involve one person infecting many others, often at a traditional burial where the body is washed and touched. Early in the current Ebola outbreak, 12 women were infected at the funeral of a traditional healer in Sierra Leone.

Ebola control is delayed by fear and distrust: Outbreaks are more difficult to fight when people in affected areas have a poor understanding of the disease or distrust authorities and medical practices.

Outbreaks are stopped by isolation, careful nursing and contact tracing: Previous Ebola outbreaks have been stopped by isolating and limiting direct physical contact with infected patients, whether they are cared for at home or in a hospital. As new patients are found, investigators try to find, track and monitor their contacts. That effort, called contact tracing, is time-consuming work. During the 1976 outbreak of Ebola in Yambuku, Zaire, surveillance teams drove to surrounding villages and interviewed 34 000 families looking for people with symptoms of infection.

Outbreaks are stopped with mobilisation of resources: Summarizing the Ebola outbreak in Yambuku, Zaire, a WHO report in 1978 said: "No more dramatic or potentially explosive epidemic of a new viral disease has occurred in the world in the past 30 years. ... No better example comes to mind to illustrate the need for national disease surveillance and the prompt solicitation of international assistance, nor of the need for the development of international resources, comprising personnel, equipment, transport, communication and finance, that can be made available in a very few days to cope with such emergencies." ... -- more
