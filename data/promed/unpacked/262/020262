In November 2014, 3 people in Orange County, California were hospitalized with a type of botulism likely contracted from injecting contaminated black tar heroin, the Health Care Agency said Wed 17 Dec 2014. All 3 adults had wound botulism, a kind of botulism caused by a potentially deadly bacterium more commonly associated with canned and preserved goods and improperly handled food. However, wound botulism is far more prevalent than foodborne botulism in California.

"We have a concern that people in the community just in general could be exposed to black tar heroin and could be at risk," Dr Matt Zahn, head of epidemiology at the Health Care Agency, said. Still, it's a rare disease, there hadn't been a case in Orange County since 2011. Statewide, there were 50 cases from 2009 to 2012.

People with wound botulism in California, where black tar heroin is prevalent, fall ill after injecting the heroin into their muscles instead of their veins. Skin popping, or IMing, short for intra-muscular, as it's called, is common among users who can't inject intravenously because their veins are scarred or because they want to avoid track marks.

That method creates abscesses, which can become infected with the bacterium that causes botulism, _Clostridium botulinum_. It grows in the abscess, releasing neurotoxins into the bloodstream, causing drooping eyelids, blurred or double vision, and, if untreated, potentially paralysis and death. It is not contagious.

Because the heroin itself is contaminated, not the needle, cleaning the skin or syringes before injections will not prevent infection. The authors of a 1998 survey published in the Journal of the American Medical Association surmised that the black tar heroin is most likely contaminated after manufacturing or during distribution, when it's "cut" or diluted, with a substance containing spores of the bacterium.

Zahn said there was no evidence that the 3 people who got sick, 2 were admitted to the intensive care unit, had purchased heroin from the same dealer. A full recovery could take weeks or months.

Wound botulism occurs when spores of _Clostridium botulinum_ contaminate a wound, germinate, and produce botulinum neurotoxin in vivo. Most of the wound botulism cases have been among injecting drug users (IDUs). Those IDUs who intentionally or accidentally inject subcutaneously or intramuscularly may be particularly vulnerable to infection.

Black tar heroin continues to be associated with clusters of wound botulism, both in the USA and in Europe. This form of heroin is a gummy black substance usually produced in makeshift factories, mostly in Mexico, adjacent to opium poppy fields (1). It is generally injected subcutaneously in a process referred to as skin popping. The local area may be unremarkable or may be necrotic or abscess forming.

The tarry nature of the drug has led to a number of diluents ("cutting" agents), which have been postulated to be the source of the _C. botulinum_ spores. In Passaro's study (1), the development of wound botulism was not affected by cleaning the skin, cleaning the injection paraphernalia, or sharing needles.

Clinicians should suspect botulism in any patient with a descending, flaccid paralysis. Botulinum antitoxin is effective in reducing the severity of symptoms for all forms of botulism if administered early in the course of the disease and should not be delayed for the results of microbiological testing.

In cases of wound botulism, antimicrobial therapy and surgical debridement are necessary to remove the organism and avoid relapse after antitoxin treatment. _C. botulinum_ is sensitive to benzyl penicillin and metronidazole.

Toxin type A (one of now 8 types of botulinum toxin) causes most cases of wound botulism in the USA. The syndrome produced by toxin type A is most severe, with more rapid progression of paralysis and a higher proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. All toxin types exert their action on the cholinergic system at the presynaptic motor-neuron terminal by blocking acetylcholine transmission across the neuromuscular junction.
