West Nile Virus-positive Birds Reported in Maine
------------------------------------------------
The State of Maine has reported the finding of West Nile virus (WNV)
in 4 dead birds collected in Androscoggin (crow), Cumberland (crow),
Franklin (sharp-shinned hawk), and York Counties (blue jay). The birds
were collected between 22 and 31 Aug 2001.
This is the first-ever detection of WNV in Maine and almost certainly
indicates local transmission of the virus. No human or equine cases of
WNV infection have yet been detected in Maine.

Second West Nile Virus-positive Bird Found in North Carolina
------------------------------------------------------------
Cabarrus County has the Charlotte area's first case of West Nile
virus, but health officials said on Mon 17 Sep 2001 that the
probability of an outbreak of human disease is low. The infected bird
is the second case of West Nile virus infection in North Carolina [in
2001 and more [may be on the way, state experts said.
The diagnosis comes about one year after the state's first case, a
crow discovered near Jordan Lake in Chatham County [in 2000.
State officials have no plans for a wide spray of insecticide in
Cabarrus, since the mosquito season is ending and mosquito
populations are declining.

First West Nile Virus-positive Birds Reported in Tennessee
----------------------------------------------------------
Yvonne Madlock, Director, Memphis and Shelby County Health
Department, announced today that the Tennessee Department of Health
laboratory in Nashville has identified through preliminary testing, 9
birds recently found in Shelby County to be positive for West Nile
virus (WNV). The birds have been sent to the Centers for Disease
Control & Prevention (CDC) laboratory in Fort Collins, Colorado for
confirmatory testing. They are the first birds to test positive for
West Nile virus in Tennessee.
No human cases of the WNV have been reported to date in Tennessee.
These birds were dead Blue Jays found in zip codes 38117 and 38119.
Memphis and Shelby County Health Department plans to increase
larviciding and surveillance activities in these zip codes. While
adulticiding ("spraying") is not as effective in controlling
mosquitoes as larvaciding, the Department will begin adulticiding in
these areas early Tuesday morning.
Since the beginning of the mosquito season, in early April 2001, the
Health Department's Vector Control Program has worked to reduce
mosquito breeding throughout Shelby County with the aggressive
elimination of mosquitoes by extensive application of larvicide to
sites of standing water that cannot be emptied or drained. Daily
monitoring of mosquitoes in the city and county has been conducted by
collecting mosquito larvae and adult mosquitoes to help the Department
to determine the distribution, density and type of mosquitoes in our
community.

Four suspected West Nile Virus-positive birds found in Kentucky
---------------------------------------------------------------
Dead birds found in Jefferson and Woodford counties apparently were
infected with West Nile virus, health officials said on Wed 19 Sep
2001.
The dead birds, a crow and 2 sparrows found in Jefferson County and a
grackle found in Woodford County, were tested at the University of
Kentucky Livestock Disease Diagnostic Laboratory. Preliminary results
indicated West Nile virus infection. Samples are being sent to a
national laboratory in Madison, Wis., for more testing. If confirmed,
it would be the second known occurrence of the virus in Kentucky. A
horse on a farm in Bourbon County was found to be infected in August
[2001 but survived.
There has been no confirmed case of the virus in a human in Kentucky.
Until this summer, West Nile virus was found mainly in the Northeast.
It has slowly made its way south and west.The disease is carried by
birds, especially crows, blue jays and birds of prey. Mosquitoes
acquire it from infected birds and can pass it along through bites to
some livestock and humans.
