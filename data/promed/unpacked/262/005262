A form of typhus with flu-like symptoms that can lead to hospitalization if left untreated is popping up in parts of Southern California, and possums are the likely culprits [opossums found in Southern California are also referred to as possums]. Cases of murine typhus, an infection spread by either flea bites or contact with flea feces, are being reported in the communities of Altadena, Los Feliz, and Pasadena and South Pasadena, which have large possum populations, said Dr Rachel Civen of the LA [Los Angeles] County Health Department, who calls it "a niche disease."

Symptoms include high fever, nausea, fatigue, and muscle weakness. 46 cases were reported in LA County in 2014, 3 in Altadena, where crews posted notices and launched a possum search. "Possums have massive proportions of fleas on them," Civen said. "Thousands of them." That makes them ideal carriers for the disease. Fleas carry the disease from rats, opossums, or feral cats, and can infect the family pet.

"It's a pretty benign disease for dogs and cats," Civen said, but the pet can infect other fleas, which then can bite and infect humans. Murine typhus symptoms are similar to flu, and can be difficult to pinpoint and diagnose. That's what happened to a 74 year old ear, nose, and throat doctor who landed in the hospital after his typhus was incorrectly diagnosed as influenza. The doctor usually walks to work at his practice in Old Town Pasadena 3 times a week. In late January 2015, the idea of walking became less appealing and he began feeling more tired than usual.

The fatigue became overwhelming. "I had a fever of about 101 deg F [38.3 deg C]," he said. Then came the night sweats and he had no appetite and stopped eating. Dehydration set in. Soon his muscles got weaker and weaker. He lost control of his bladder. A similar story was unfolding not far away at his son's house. Doctors originally diagnosed the son's illness as the flu. But both men knew it wasn't as simple as that. It was a conversation with a friend in Altadena that finally led to some answers. "He told me the health department had passed out fliers about a disease," the son said.

The fliers described symptoms similar to what both men were experiencing. The son demanded a typhus test, which came back positive. In the meantime, the father was bound for a 3-day stay at the hospital, where antimicrobial treatments started beating back the disease. The father says it took him nearly 3 weeks to recover, "though I'm still having night sweats." He also may not look at his 6 year old cocker spaniel the same way again. Even though he said with a laugh, "she's staring up at me adoringly right now."

[There are 5 classical diseases with typhus literally or figuratively in their names: epidemic typhus, Brill-Zinsser disease (recrudescent epidemic typhus), murine typhus, scrub typhus, and typhoid (so-called because it is typhus-like). The term typhus comes from the Greek, _typhein_ -- to smoke -- which may refer to the smoky or clouded mental status that patients present with.

Murine typhus, caused by _Rickettsia typhi_, is distributed widely throughout the world, especially in the warm and humid coastal environments of tropic and subtropical climes. Although clearly endemic in Hawaii, the increased number of cases this year (2014) deserves note. In the developed world, the infection is found along the eastern coasts of south Atlantic states in the USA, the Caribbean, and Pacific coasts of the south west USA as well as Hawaii. In Europe, it is distributed along the Mediterranean coast as well as the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts of Africa. It is a zoonosis in which rats function as the disease's asymptomatic reservoir, and the Oriental rat flea _Xenopsylla cheopis_ is the commonest vector. Although generally coastal in distribution, the disease may well spread away from the coast via major routes of transportation. Although rickettsia-infected flea feces being rubbed into a flea bite appears to be the major vehicle of transmission to humans, flea bites themselves and aerosolization of flea feces may transmit infection as well.

Murine typhus is a relatively mild disease. Among patients admitted to an acute care hospital with this disease, only 10 per cent require an intensive care unit setting, and only 1-4 per cent die.

Tetracyclines appear to remain the drug of choice in treatment. - Mod.LL
