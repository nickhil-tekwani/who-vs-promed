A total of 15 people became ill in 2 separate clusters in incidences
linked to drinking raw milk, state health officials say.

The 1st cluster involved 9 reported cases of _Campylobacter_
infection among residents in Weber, Davis, and Cache counties [Utah].
The other cluster involved 6 reported cases of _Salmonella_ infection
in Utah, Salt Lake, and Wasatch counties [this outbreak was posted in
ProMED-mail Salmonellosis, unpasteurized milk - USA: (UT)
20100517.1616 - Mod.LL].

All who became ill reported drinking raw, unpasteurized milk produced
at 2 licensed dairies, said Julia Hall, food-borne epidemiologist for
the Utah Department of Health. All patients have recovered.

"There are inherent risks associated with the consumption of raw milk
because of disease-causing bacteria that are commonly found in milk,
such as _Campylobacter_, _Salmonella_, _Listeria_, and _E. coli_,"
said Hall. "Even with strict state regulations in place, there is no
guarantee that raw milk is free of disease-causing bacteria."

Ropelato Dairy, in Ogden, Utah was the source of the _Campylobacter_
outbreak. Samples came back high for coliform bacteria counts,
implicating the presence of disease-causing pathogens in the milk.
Ropelato's license to sell raw milk has been suspended, said Larry
Lewis, spokesman for the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food.

Redmond Dairy, in central UT, produced raw milk for stores in Heber
City and Orem linked to the salmonellosis cluster. Samples from 5 Apr
2010 to 22 Apr 2010 came back positive for _Salmonella_, said Hall.
The dairy's St George store was not linked to the outbreak.

Raw milk, which makes up only a small niche of the state's dairy
industry, contaminated with disease-causing bacteria may not smell or
look any different from non-contaminated raw milk, and there is no
obvious way for the consumer to know if the raw milk is contaminated.

[The following is extracted from the FDA in 2004, "Got Milk? Make
Sure It's Pasteurized":

"Raw milk advocates claim that unprocessed milk is healthier because
pasteurization destroys nutrients and the enzymes necessary to absorb
calcium. It also kills beneficial bacteria and is associated with
allergies, arthritis, and other diseases, they say.

This is simply not the case, says Sheehan [John Sheehan, director of
the Food and Drug Administration's Division of Dairy and Egg Safety].
Research has shown that there is no significant difference in the
nutritional value of pasteurized and unpasteurized milk, he says. The
caseins, the major family of milk proteins, are largely unaffected,
and any modification in whey protein that might occur is barely perceptible.

"Milk is a good source of the vitamins thiamine, folate, B-12, and
riboflavin," adds Sheehan, "and pasteurization results in losses of
anywhere from zero to 10 percent for each of these, which most would
consider only a marginal reduction."

While the major nutrients are left unchanged by pasteurization,
vitamin D, which enhances the body's absorption of calcium, is added
to processed milk. Vitamin D is not found in significant levels in raw milk.

"Pasteurization will destroy some enzymes," says Barbara Ingham, PhD,
associate professor, and extension food scientist at the University
of Wisconsin-Madison. "But the enzymes that are naturally present in
milk are bovine enzymes. Our bodies don't use animal enzymes to help
metabolize calcium and other nutrients. Enzymes in the food that we
eat and drink are broken down in the human gastrointestinal tract,"
adds Ingham. "Human bodies rely on our own native enzymes to digest
and metabolize food. Most of the native enzymes of milk survive
pasteurization largely intact," says Sheehan, "including those
thought to have natural antimicrobial properties and those that
contribute to prolonging milk's shelf life." Other enzymes that
survive are thought to play a role in cheese ripening.

Ingham says that pasteurization will destroy some bacteria that may
be helpful in the fermentation of milk into products such as cheese
and yogurt, "but the benefit of destroying the harmful bacteria
vastly outweighs the supposed benefits of retaining those helpful
microorganisms. Plus, by adding the microorganisms that we need for
fermentation, we can assure a consistently high quality product."

Science has not shown a connection between drinking raw milk and
disease prevention. "The small quantities of antibodies in milk are
not absorbed in the human intestinal tract," says Ingham. "And there
is no scientific evidence that raw milk contains an anti-arthritis
factor or that it enhances resistance to other diseases."

Fans of raw milk often cite its creamy rich taste, says Szalkucki
[Tom Szalkucki, assistant director of the Wisconsin Center for Dairy
Research at the University of Wisconsin-Madison], who adds that it
may be creamier because it is not made according to the standards for
processed milk. "If you go to a grocery store and buy fluid milk,
it's been standardized for a certain percentage of fat, such as 2
percent," he says. "Raw milk is potentially creamier because it has
not been standardized and it has a higher fat content." - Mod.LL]
