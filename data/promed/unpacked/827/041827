The number of South Koreans who have died after getting flu shots has risen to 48, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) said on Saturday [24 Oct 2020], adding that the vaccines would continue to reduce the chance of having simultaneous epidemics.

The health authorities said they found no direct link between the deaths and the shots. They plan to carry on with the state-run vaccination programme to try to avoid having to fight both the flu and the coronavirus over the coming winter.

"After reviewing death cases so far, it is not the time to suspend a flu vaccination programme since vaccination is very crucial this year [2020], considering ... the COVID-19 outbreaks," KDCA Director Jeong Eun-kyung told a briefing.

Jeong said the review had shown no direct link between the flu shots and the 26 deaths that have been investigated. Some 20 initial autopsy results from the police and the National Forensic Service showed that 13 people died of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and other disorders not caused by the vaccination.

The death toll among those who have been vaccinated rose by 12 cases from a day earlier to 48 on Saturday [24 Oct 2020]. The rising deaths have caused some doctors and politicians to call for a halt to the government campaign to vaccinate about 30 million of the country's 54 million people.

While encouraging people to get flu vaccines, Jeong issued precautions to take before getting the shot, such as drinking enough water and telling healthcare workers about any underlying medical conditions. She also advised people to wait 15-30 minutes before leaving the clinic where they receive their vaccine.

"If possible, try to get the flu shot when it's warm, since there are concerns that low temperatures could affect cardiovascular disease or cerebrovascular disease," she said.

The KDCA said 9.4 million people had been inoculated as of Friday [23 Oct 2020] in the programme that began in September [2020], with 1154 cases of adverse reactions.

South Korea reported 77 new coronavirus cases as of Friday [23 Oct 2020] midnight, bringing total infections to 25 775, with 457 deaths.

[According to Kunihiko Iizuka, a Japanese media said there were a total of 25 post-flu-shot deaths in 2009-2019 (https://www.sankei.com/world/news/201024/wor2010240022-n1.html). This points to how unusual this rash of deaths is with a jump of 12 cases in one day.

Officials said that 2 of the original 13 deaths might have resulted from anaphylactic shock, a serious allergic reaction, but gave no further details.

Nine of those who originally died, all of whom had received flu shots in the past, received vaccines supplied by several different local drugmakers, officials said. (Thus it is unlikely this preparation of the vaccine itself is the cause of the high numbers of deaths.)

Possible causes of death shortly following virus vaccination include anaphylaxis, systemic infection following administration of live vaccine to immunocompromised individuals, Guillain-Barre syndrome (after inactivated influenza vaccine), viscerotropic disease or neurologic disease following yellow fever vaccination, and other examples. But these rare occurrences, albeit tragic, should not deter vaccination campaigns that prevent thousands of illnesses annually. Vaccines, which are rigorously tested, are among the safest medical products produced. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System is reviewed by CDC and the FDA. These adverse events must be balanced against the number of deaths each vaccine prevents.

According to a 13 Dec 2017 World Health Organization news release, "Up to 650 000 deaths annually are associated with respiratory diseases from seasonal influenza, according to estimates [made in 2017] by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC), the WHO, and global health partners. This marks an increase on the previous global estimate of 250 000 - 500 000, which dates from over 10 years ago and covered all influenza-related deaths, including cardiovascular disease or diabetes. The new figures of 290 000 - 650 000 deaths are based on more recent data from a larger, more diverse group of countries, including lower middle-income countries, and exclude deaths from non-respiratory diseases."

"These figures indicate the high burden of influenza and its substantial social and economic cost to the world," Dr Peter Salama, Executive Director of WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, said in the news release. "They highlight the importance of influenza prevention for seasonal epidemics, as well as preparedness for pandemics."

The report above does not state whether a parallel steep increase in deaths was seen in the general population who were not vaccinated. Further investigation is warranted. - Mod.LK
