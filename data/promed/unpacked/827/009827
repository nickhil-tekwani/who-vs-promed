The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is investigating 2 cases of scarlet fever complicated with toxic shock syndrome.

The 1st one is a fatal case involving a 14-year-old girl with good past health. She presented with on and off low-grade fever since 6 Jan 2012, associated with cough, runny nose, and malaise. The girl sought medical consultation from 3 different private clinics for 5 times from 6 to 17 Jan 2012.

Her condition did not improve and she developed rapid breathing since 17 Jan 2012 and attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital early next morning. She was admitted to Paediatric Intensive Care Unit with septic shock, pneumonia, and pleural effusion. Her condition deteriorated and she passed away later in the same day. Her pleural aspirate specimen tested positive for _Streptococcus pyogenes_ (group A).

The girl lived with her parents and a younger brother in Eastern District. Her mother and younger brother had recent upper respiratory infection symptoms. Swabs will be taken from them for further tests.

The girl used to study at a secondary school in Happy Valley and last attended school on 16 Jan 2012. There has been no report of an outbreak of respiratory illness in the school. As a precautionary measure, the school is advised to suspend class tomorrow for thorough cleansing and disinfection. She did not travel outside Hong Kong before onset of symptoms. But she travelled to Macau from 7-8 Jan 2012.

The 2nd case involves an 11-year-old boy with good past health. He presented with cough and runny nose since 8 Jan 2012 and developed fever since 13 Jan 2012. He was admitted to a private hospital on 15 Jan 2012. Group A streptococcus was isolated from his blood specimen. He was transferred to Paediatric Intensive Care Unit of Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital on 17 Jan 2012. On the same day, he also developed generalised sandpaper-like skin rash. He is now in stable condition.

He is studying in a primary school in Wan Chai District. He last attended school on 13 Jan 2012. The school will start holiday tomorrow [20 Jan 2012] and as a precautionary measure, the school is advised to carry out thorough cleansing and disinfection.

The CHP's investigation revealed that the patient has no recent travel history. His home contacts are asymptomatic. CHP's investigation into the 2 cases above continues.

A CHP spokesman explained that scarlet fever is caused by group A _Streptococcus_ bacteria and can be cured by appropriate antibiotics. The disease usually affects children between 2 to 8 years of age and presents as fever, sore throat, and rash. The rash appears over the trunk and neck and spreads to the limbs especially the armpits, elbows, and groin. The illness is usually clinically mild but can be complicated by shock, heart, and kidney diseases.

[These 2 cases of scarlet fever and toxic shock complicating _Streptococcus pyogenes_ (group A _Streptococcus_ or GAS) infection may indicate that the GAS outbreak in Hong Kong that was extensively reported by ProMED-mail last year (2011) (see previous ProMED-mail posts listed below) is ongoing.

GAS is an aerobic Gram positive organism that forms chains and is an important cause of pharyngitis and soft tissue infections. Scarlet fever is caused by strains of GAS that produce an erythrogenic exotoxin, which causes the red rash that is characteristic of the illness. Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) is caused strains that produce one or more exotoxins that that act as superantigens. Superantigens are molecules that interact with the T-cell receptor in a domain outside of the antigen recognition site. Superantigens are thus able to activate large numbers of T cells resulting in massive cytokine release that consequently causes shock and multiorgan failure.

Tissue invasiveness of _Streptococcus pyogenes_ has been attributed to several virulence factors, especially the cell wall M protein, encoded by the emm gene. Serotypes M1 and M3, in particular, have been associated with invasive infection. The serotypes of isolates involved in a prior Hong Kong outbreak were reported to be predominantly serotype M12, with smaller numbers of M1 and M2 (see ProMED-mail post Streptococcus group A, scarlet fever - China (07): (HK, MO) 20110627.1963).

Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, abbreviated as NSAIDs, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen, although not mentioned in reference to the 2 cases in the news report above, may exacerbate skin and soft tissue infections caused by GAS, and lead to necrotizing fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome (see ProMED-mail Streptococcus group A, scarlet fever - China (08): (HK, MO) 20110628.1966).

In the 2011 Hong Kong outbreak, the GAS isolates were reported to be resistant to some of the antibiotics usually used to treat this infection. However, the news release above does not report the antibiotic susceptibilities of the isolates.
