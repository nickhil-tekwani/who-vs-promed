Study says 3 H5N1 variants reached Germany
------------------------------------------
Scientists say they have found 3 distinct variants of H5N1 avian
influenza virus in wild birds in Germany, 2 of which might have been
brought in by wild birds migrating from Russia. Researchers from the
Friedrich Loeffler Institute in Insel Riems, Germany, analyzed 27
H5N1 isolates collected mostly from wild birds in widely scattered
locations in Germany in 2006 and this year [2007]. Writing in the
journal Veterinary Microbiology, they say the findings suggest that
the virus was brought into the country on 3 separate occasions -- 2
of them in early 2006 and the 3rd in 2007. The strains that appeared
in early 2006 are closely related to viruses found in southern and
central Russia, suggesting that wild birds on their winter migration
from Russia might have brought the strains to Germany, says the
report by E. Starick and colleagues.

In Germany in 2006, the report says, the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus
was found in 343 dead wild birds, a black swan in a zoo, 3 stray
cats, and a stone marten and on one turkey farm. In June and July of
this year [2007] the virus was found in 96 wild birds in scattered
areas of southeastern Germany and in one backyard goose. More
recently, the disease killed ducks on a farm in Bavaria in late
August (an outbreak not covered by this study). The researchers
collected 27 H5N1 viruses from 17 species of wild birds, the turkey
farm, one stray cat, and the stone marten, the report says.

Previous study of the H5N1 viruses found in Germany indicated they
all belonged to the strain that killed many wild waterfowl at Qinghai
Lake in northern China in April 2005, called clade 2.2, the authors
say. The new analysis of the 27 isolates showed that they fell into 3
groups that formed geographic and temporal clusters.

The viruses collected in 2006 formed 2 groups: one from northern
Germany, designated subclade 2.2.2, and one from southern Germany,
called subclade 2.2.1. The isolates gathered in 2007 formed a 3rd
type, which the authors called subclade 2.2.3, no examples of which
were found in 2006. Some members of both of the 2006 subclades were
found in central Germany, and both types were involved in the poultry
farm outbreak, the report says. In addition, one isolate of the
"northern" type (subclade 2.2.2) was found in southern Germany, and
one of the "southern" type was identified in northern Germany.

The authors write that the 3 subclades they identified match up with
3 clades described by other researchers who analyzed the complete
genomes of 71 H5N1 viruses from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa
(EMA). The northern Germany isolates fit in EMA group 2, those from
the south in EMA group 1, and the 2007 isolates in EMA group 3, the
report says.

"Our data suggest the simultaneous introduction in early 2006 of 2
closely related but distinct H5N1 variants into the wild bird
population of Germany," the report states. "The source of these
viruses and the exact time of introduction could not be identified."

But because the 2 subclades are closely related to H5N1 variants from
southern and central Russia, the authors add, "an introduction,
possibly via wild birds on winter escape from these regions, early in
2006 appears to be a highly likely scenario."

The separate subclade found in Germany in 2007 appears to represent a
"new incursion," whose sources and routes of introduction remain
unknown, the report adds.

David A. Halvorson, DVM, a veterinary pathologist and avian flu
expert at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul, commented that the
similarity between the German and Russian isolates doesn't
necessarily mean the viruses were brought to Germany by wild birds.
"What is clear is that related viruses were introduced into Germany
and they were observed in wild waterfowl before they were observed in
domestic poultry," Halvorson told CIDRAP News. "This suggests that
waterfowl may have been the source of introduction, but it doesn't
prove it. This was known before the viruses were sequenced."

Starick E, Beer M, Hoffmann B, et al. Phylogenetic analyses of highly
pathogenic avian influenza virus isolates from Germany in 2006 and
2007 suggest at least 3 separate introductions of H5N1 virus. Vet
