comment in the original report. - Mod.CP]

In the United States, there are multiple rabies virus variants
transmitted mainly among wildlife species such as raccoons, skunks,
insectivorous bats and gray foxes and accounting for about 95 percent
of the 7000 - 10 000 diagnosed cases annually. Any mammal is
susceptible to rabies including humans and domestic pets and
livestock. Cats are the leading domestic animal with rabies
outnumbering dogs 3 to one. Irrespective of rabies virus variant,
once an infection is established and clinical signs are present, the
disease is virtually always fatal.

Both the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the
respective state departments of health have participated in programs
to control raccoon rabies through an Oral Rabies Vaccine, often in
suburban and rural settings.

Vaccinating foxes has been a successful strategy to control the red
fox rabies virus variants found in Europe and Canada. An Oral Rabies
Vaccine bait is inserted within a compressed block of fishmeal and
fish oil, which is very attractive to wildlife. Dropped from planes
or distributed by land vehicles, the bait is quickly consumed often
within 5 days. Once consumed by the wild animal, antibodies will
develop within 2-3 weeks and thus contribute to herd immunity among
the population to reduce and ultimately eliminate transmission in the
locality.

The potential adverse effects of human and domestic animal contact
with baits and vaccine depends mainly upon the rabies vaccine
biologic contained in the bait. These are live virus vaccines based
on highly attenuated rabies viruses (which may result in small
numbers of vaccine-induced rabies in susceptible hosts), a
vaccinia-rabies glycoprotein recombinant virus vaccine (which in 2
humans resulted in vaccinia infections), and experimental adenovirus
recombinant vaccines.

The raccoon rabies outbreak on the Eastern coast of the United States
is one of the most intensive rabies epizootics on record. Most
persons bitten by rabid or potentially rabid raccoons or other
animals have received human rabies post-exposure prophylaxis to
prevent human rabies. Fortunately raccoon rabies has only resulted in
one known human case where the person apparently did not seek
post-exposure prophylaxis.

While raccoons, skunks, foxes and coyotes are considered high-risk
sources of exposure, bats are the most common source of infection for
people across the United States probably because their bite is quite
small and does not cause sufficient trauma for persons to seek
medical care including assessment for risk of rabies. For example,
from 1990 to 2003, there were 38 human rabies cases acquired within
the US. Of those, 2 occurred in New York State, and none occurred in
New York City. Of the 38 cases, 32 were due to bats.
