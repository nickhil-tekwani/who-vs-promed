The Greek Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KEELPNO) has warned that malaria could be making a comeback in Greece, 38 years after the country was officially deemed free of the disease.

According to KEELPNO, as daily Kathimerini reports, 40 cases of malaria were detected in Greece in the 1st 7 months of this year [2012]. In 6 of those cases, those infected had no history of travel to countries where the potentially deadly disease is still endemic. The numbers are so far similar to last year [2011], when there was a spike in September. In previous years, there had been a total of 30-50 cases recorded but almost exclusively among people who had traveled to Greece from countries where malaria is still prevalent.

KEELPNO attributed the rise in malaria cases to climate conditions, the activity of mosquitoes, and a greater influx of immigrants. This prompted the watchdog to warn of a "real prospect" of the disease re-establishing itself in Greece.

[In a report dated 13 Aug 2012, the European Centre for Disease Control states, "6 autochthonous cases of _Plasmodium vivax_ malaria have been reported from Greece since June 2012. According to the Greek authorities, active screening of neighbours and seasonal immigrants is being carried out to detect malarial infection, and vector control measures are being implemented." (see http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/press/news/Lists/News/ECDC_DispForm.aspx?List=32e43ee8%2De230%2D4424%2Da783%2D85742124029a&ID=703.)

The previous report on malaria from the Hellenic Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KEELPNO), dated 29 Jun 2012 (http://www.keelpno.gr/Portals/0/Files/English%20files/Malaria%20report%2029-6-2012.pdf), mentions one case in 2012, reported by ProMED-mail on 17 Jul 2012 (Malaria, P. vivax - Greece: autochthonous (AT) 20120717.1205005).

The 6 autochthonous cases reported by the ECDC in 2012 could have been infected in 2011. This would fit very well with a temperate zone _P. vivax_ and it is therefore very important to genotype the _P. vivax_ isolates. - Mod.EP
