HSE Warns: Measles Threat from European Outbreak
------------------------------------------------
According to the reports of doctors, one in every 5 children has been
diagnosed with measles in Ireland [Eire] this year. Also there are
reports that the chances are higher that the affected children had
visited Europe, or had been in contact with someone who had travelled
here from the continent [continental Europe] in the weeks before they
fell ill.

Thus, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HSE) is urging
parents to get their children fully vaccinated against measles
following the large outbreak of the disease in Europe. Public health
specialist Dr. Suzanne Cotter has also confirmed the 42 measles cases
that have been reported in Ireland since January [2011]. The doctor
further added that among the 42 cases, 8 cases were of children aged
one, who were too young to have been vaccinated. MMR [vaccine] shot
guards against measles, mumps and rubella, which is generally
administered to children around the age of one with a 2nd dose around
the age of 5.

"Many cases are due to travel of infected people between countries.
As there is more travel between Europe and Ireland over the summer,
there is an increased risk to Irish children and teenagers who are not
fully vaccinated against measles," Dr. Cotter said.

Possible Measles Exposure for Passengers on Flight to San Diego
---------------------------------------------------------------
Passengers on a United Airlines flight from Chicago to San Diego on
27 May 2011 may have been exposed to measles, the San Diego County
Health and Human Services Agency announced Thursday (2 Jun 2011). A
43-year-old Italian man with the highly contagious disease traveled
from Brussels, Belgium, to New York City and then to Rochester, New
York state. He then flew to Chicago and caught the aircraft bound for
San Diego, United Flight 521, according to the agency.

Suspected case of the measles in Cohasset
-----------------------------------------
There's a suspected case of the measles in Cohasset, Massachusetts.
Health officials are warning parents at a nursery school to watch for
symptoms.

As little ones show up for the afternoon session at the South Shore
Nursery School parents are hoping for news that the suspected case of
measles there does not turn out to be an actual case of measles. "They
gave us a timeframe of when the child was here," said a parent. But
school officials really did not go beyond that according to parents.

A woman wound up taking her 5-year-old boy to the pediatrician. "It's
a small school, so I think that he has been exposed but not directly,"
she said. "But we're not sure so just to play safe we went to get him
his booster shot."

So far this year there have been 17 cases of the measles in
Massachusetts, including a worker at the French consulate in Boston's
Back Bay and an employee at South Station. Recently there have been
measles cases involving young children, including 2 elementary school
kids in Brookline and a 23-month-old toddler in Boston just last
week.

Health officials say the increase in measles cases is being connected
to the measles outbreak that is going on in Europe. "It's her last
official day of school and tomorrow's graduation…I don't want her to
miss both of those so I can't just stay home and hide from it. I'm
going to hope for the best…hope that she didn't get exposed and hope
that the child that is sick gets better," said the parent.

Measles is highly contagious. Symptoms include fever, dry cough,
runny nose and a skin rash. Health officials say that right now there
are actually several suspected measles cases across the state.

Another case of measles confirmed
---------------------------------
Just 2 weeks after the state Department of Health issued an advisory
about a Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute [RPI] student who contracted
measles, the department has confirmed a 2nd case of the rare
respiratory infection, this time in a young child. The department said
Monday [30 may 2011] it would not disclose the identity or gender of
the child. Officials are looking into the possibility that the child
was at the emergency room at the same time as an RPI student who was
diagnosed with measles earlier this month.

According to the department, anyone who was at any of the following
places where the young child recently was and is not immune to measles
should contact their local health department to determine if they are
a candidate to receive preventive treatment:

- Seton Health (St. Mary's) Emergency Department on 26 May from 5
a.m. to 8:30 a.m. or 27 May from 9 p.m. to 28 May at 1 a.m.

- Albany Medical Center Hospital Emergency Department triage area on
28 May from 1 a.m. to 1 p.m.

- Seton Pediatrics or the medical building at 500 Federal St. on 24
May between 1 and 3:30 p.m.

- Seton Internal Medicine at 147 Hoosick St., Troy, on 26 May between
11 a.m. and 2 p.m.

- Price Chopper on Hoosick Street, Troy, on 26 May between 12 noon
and 3 p.m.

- Goodwill on Hoosick Street, Troy, on 26 May between 12 noon and 3
p.m.

According to the health department, the following locations were
visited by the RPI student after the student was infected:

- Samaritan Hospital Emergency Department, Troy, from 5 p.m. to 11
p.m. 12 May and 7:30 p.m. to -- 10:30 p.m. 13 May.

- Albany Medical Center Hospital Emergency Department, 8:40 p.m. 13
May, until 6 a.m. 14 May.

- RPI Campus, Troy, from 8-16 May.

- Uncle Sam's Health Food Store, Route 9, Latham, noon to 4 p.m. 12
May.

- Rite Aid Pharmacy, Burdett Avenue, Troy, 8:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. 12
May.

Measles is a highly contagious infection caused by a virus. Children
under the age of one, women who are pregnant and those with
compromised immune systems are at the highest risk of contracting
measles. Measles can be contracted by adults as well as children.

Cache County child has confirmed case of measles
------------------------------------------------
A school-age child in Cache County has measles, health officials at
the Bear River Health Department said Tuesday [31 May 2011], the 1st
confirmed case in the county in many years. Officials do not yet know
how the child caught the highly contagious virus.

It's possible the child caught measles from an undetected case
related to Salt Lake County's recent outbreak, but the exact source
may never be known, said Lloyd Berentzen, executive director of Bear
River Health Department. "The child has had no known exposure other
than being in Salt Lake during the outbreak there." About 15 people --
including unvaccinated students at the child's school, which ends
classes on Thursday [2 Jun 2011] -- have been asked to self-quarantine
for an indefinite period of time, Berentzen said.

In Salt Lake County, officials on 17 May 2011 declared a recent
9-person outbreak over, after a 28-day quarantine period concluded
with no new cases. That outbreak started with the unimmunized children
in one family who traveled to Poland to retrieve a missionary.

The child in Cache County is believed to have been exposed on 13 May
2011, an estimate based on when the child started showing symptoms,
said Berentzen. The child had not been vaccinated. Health officials
couldn't publicly announce the case until they received confirmed test
results on Monday, he said. "The family was unusually cooperative and
discovered it about as early as we could," he said. "We think the
disease had little time in the school and we're hoping we got in front
of it. But you never know."

New England Aquarium Volunteer Exposed Public to Measles
--------------------------------------------------------
The Boston Public Health Commission learned today from Vermont health
officials the volunteer was at the Aquarium's main building on 19 and
22 May 2011 after noon while contagious. Anyone who was in the main
building during those days, and do NOT know if they are immune to
measles are advised to refrain from public activity until 21 days
after the exposure.

A 17-year-old Vermont resident volunteered while contagious with
measles at the New England Aquarium exposing the public to the
airborne virus. The New England Aquarium is currently researching to
see how many people may have been exposed through attendance records.
Measles is an airborne virus that is spread person-to-person through
the air, and so far this year more measles cases have been reported
since 1996. Several cases have already been confirmed in Boston this
year.

If you have had 2 doses of the measles-containing vaccine (MMR) or
have had a blood test showing you are immune then you are viewed as
being immune to measles. If you are born in the United States before
1957 you are likely immune to measles. If you are not aware of your
immune status then you should try to locate immunization records and
monitor yourself for symptoms.

Measles symptoms usually begin 10 to 12 days after exposure to a
person with measles, but can be delayed for as long as 18 days. Early
symptoms include a high fever, runny nose, cough, and red, watery
eyes. A skin rash usually occurs 2 to 4 days later and begins on the
face, but soon spreads to other parts of the body. If you think you
have symptoms of measles, you should telephone your health care
provider.

Travellers Being Warned Against Measles
---------------------------------------
People travelling to their favourite destinations in the summer have
been cautioned against measles. Around 10 000 people have been
diagnosed with measles this year in 18 EU countries out of which, 4
have died. "All children and young people planning on travelling in
Europe should ensure they have had 2 doses of MMR [vaccine] before
they go away. France, Germany and Spain are all experiencing quite big
outbreaks of measles and there are problems elsewhere in Europe," says
Dr Brendan Mason, a consultant epidemiologist.

In the UK, 275 cases have been confirmed been January and April this
year, a number much higher than that of last year [2010] which was 33,
for the same time period.

France has declared measles epidemic officially as 5000 people have
contracted the disease in France in the 3 months from January to March
alone, which is almost equal to the total cases reported in the
country last year.

Turkey and Bulgaria have faced major outbreaks. Belgium, Germany,
Denmark, Romania, the Russian Federation, Sweden, Norway and
Switzerland have also reported more cases than they usually do.

Children between one and 4 have the highest probability of getting
measles. Vaccination is the only way it can be prevented. In every
1000 people who are affected by measles, one dies.

Measles outbreak hits Auckland
------------------------------
Auckland Regional Public Health Service's Medical Officer of Health
Dr Richard Hoskins has one confirmed measles cases with several more
possible cases under investigation this week. All are children and the
confirmed case attended the 10:50 am screening of 3D Pirates of the
Caribbean at St Lukes Cinemas on Saturday 28 May 2011. Movie goers who
attended that session may be at risk of measles infection if they have
not been immunised. Movie goers who attended that particular movie
screening should:

Check that their immunisations are up to date, If they are not you
should call your doctor to arrange catch-up. If you or your children
start to develop measles symptoms (runny nose, cough, sore eyes, fever
or red rash) up to 11 Jun2011, which is the Saturday after the long
weekend, please stay at home, limit visitors, and call your doctor to
arrange an appointment. Make sure you tell your doctor that it might
be measles before visiting.

Dr Hoskins advises: "Measles is highly infectious and makes people
very sick. Vaccination is the only protection from this potentially
serious disease. This disease spreads easily through the air,
especially from coughing and sneezing -- it is highly infectious. It
commonly causes ear infections and pneumonia, and may lead to other
serious complications and can, in some cases, be fatal."

"These latest measles cases confirm that measles is still circulating
in our communities so it's really important that children are
immunised to protect them from needless suffering.

Additional Public Health Advice:
- Check your children's immunisations are up to date and take action
if required (this information should be in your child's Plunket/Well
Child book -- or alternatively contact your general practitioner, GP,
or practice nurse)

- Prompt identification can help limit the spread of measles to
others, so if you or anyone in your care displays common symptoms such
as a red rash, runny nose, cough, sore eyes or fever, seek medical
help by contacting Healthline or your local doctor -- do this before
visiting a doctor to minimise the spread of infection

- Avoid visiting households where there are suspected or confirmed
measles cases

- If you are planning to travel abroad, strongly consider getting
vaccinated against measles before you go, as measles is prevalent in
many overseas countries.
