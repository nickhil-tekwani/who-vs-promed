A case of _Cryptococcus gattii_ meningoencephalitis was diagnosed in a previously healthy 20-year old female from the greater Montreal area who presented with a 4-week history of worsening headaches. On [1 Jul 2015], a lumbar puncture showed an opening pressure of 47 mm Hg and CSF cultures were positive for _Cryptococcus gattii_ (confirmed by molecular sequencing). She was treated with liposomal amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine as well as external ventricular derivation. An extensive immunology workup revealed no immune deficit.

The patient had no travel history outside the province of Quebec. She worked in a pet shop where she had direct contact with several animals. An extensive investigation performed by local authorities of animal feces, bird droppings, and the pet store's environment did not identify _C. gattii_.

Multi-locus sequence typing of the strain revealed that this is genotype VGIIa (ST 20), identical to the virulent and most prevalent strain of _C. gattii_ currently involved in the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia outbreaks (1-3).

_C. gattii_ is endemic to the Pacific coast of North America and some tropical countries. Infection is generally contracted through inhalation of fungus present in the environment. [In contrast] to _C. neoformans_, _C. gattii_ is not known to be endemic in the Northeast regions of Canada or the United States. It is therefore highly unusual to isolate the fungus from a patient with no travel history.

To our knowledge, this is the 1st autochthonous human case of _C. gattii_ [infection] reported in Eastern Canada. The chance of work-related infection cannot be confirmed or ruled-out with certainty in this case. Therefore, local environmental acquisition is certainly possible. _C. gattii_ was recently reported in a patient from New York State (ProMED-mail archive number: 20140503.2445206), as well as from a white-tail deer in Nova Scotia (http://www.cwhc-rcsf.ca/docs/annual_reports/2014_2015_CWHC_Annual_Report_EN.pdf). These sporadic cases might indicate the fungus is beginning to establish endemicity in the Northeast. These cases also underscore the necessity of systematically confirming _Cryptococcus_ species identification using either glycine-canavanine bromothymol (CGB) agar or molecular methods.

[ProMED-mail thanks Drs Dufresne and LeBlanc for submitting the case report above.

_Cryptococcus neoformans_ and _C. gattii_ are closely related pathogenic encapsulated fungi. 4 major serotypes (A-D) exist within the capsular polysaccharide antigen of these organisms. Serotypes A and D are associated with _C. neoformans_, while serotypes B and C are associated with _C. gattii_. _C. neoformans_ affects primarily immunocompromised, especially AIDS, patients, while _C. gattii_ causes meningoencephalitis and pulmonary infections in immunocompetent patients and animals (although it can also cause disease in immunocompromised patients) (http://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/cryptococcosis-gattii/risk-prevention.html).

The medium l-canavanine glycine bromothymol blue (CGB) agar can be used to differentiate _C. neoformans_ and _C. gattii_. Growth of _C. gattii_ on CGB agar produces a blue color, indicating the assimilation of glycine, while _C. neoformans_ fails to cause a color change (https://catalog.hardydiagnostics.com/cp_prod/Content/hugo/CGBAgar.html). However, false-positive reactions on CGB medium can be caused by isolates of other fungal species.

Genotyping can also be used to differentiate _C. gattii_ from _C. neoformans_. _C. neoformans_ has four molecular types VNI-IV and _C. gattii_ VGI-VGIV. _C. gattii_ had been thought to be a fungus that lives in the environment in mainly tropical and sub-tropical areas of the world, particularly Australia and Papua New Guinea, but also in parts of Africa, Asia, Europe, Mexico, Southern California, and South America, especially in association with certain species of Eucalyptus trees. However, since 1999, _C. gattii_ has caused disease in temperate Canada (Vancouver Island and mainland British Columbia) and the US Pacific Northwest (Oregon and Washington); a small number of people have also gotten _C. gattii_ infections in other areas of the US, particularly in the Southeast, without a history of travel to the Pacific Northwest (http://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/cryptococcosis-gattii/definition.html).

_C. gattii_ genotype VGIIa has been found to be the predominant genotype (90 percent) isolated from the Vancouver Island outbreak (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4437038/). The majority (78 percent) of _C. gattii_ isolates in the US has been found in Washington State and Oregon; 12 percent of _C. gattii_ isolates originate from California and 10 percent from other states throughout the continental US, Alaska, and Hawaii; 64 percent of _C. gattii_ isolates in the Pacific Northwest were the genotype VGIIa and of the VGIIa isolates, 97 percent of VGIIa isolates were from the Pacific Northwest; all VGIIa isolates from outside the Pacific Northwest were found to be associated with a travel history to the Pacific Northwest (http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0074737). VGIIa was the genotype of the _C. gattii_ isolated from the Quebec patient in the case report above, suspected to have acquired her infection locally.
