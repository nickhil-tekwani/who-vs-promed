There may have been a 4th case in UK coronavirus family cluster: WHO

In relation to the above post, we would like to confirm that the HPA is not currently investigating any 4th possible case associated with the UK cluster of novel coronavirus. The latest clinical update from the HPA was published on Tuesday [19 Feb 2013] http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpr/infections/respiratory.htm and the whole genome sequence of the 2nd UK case of coronavirus was published on Thursday [21 Feb 2013] http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/NovelCoronavirus2012/respPartialgeneticsequenceofnovelcoronavirus/

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Professor Nick Phin for this clarification as well as for providing URL links to the most recent information on this outbreak and viral genome sequence.

Of note, the interpretation of the sequencing of the whole genome of the novel coronavirus identified in the above cluster, referred to as England 2 CoV is stated at the above provided link: "Phylogenetic Analysis indicated that England 2 CoV clustered with England1 CoV and the virus identified in the Netherlands (EMC 2012, JX869059). The level of similarity within this cluster of novel coronaviruses was greater than 99.6 percent."

The HPA most recent report is included below:

"Novel coronavirus 2012 in the UK: situation at 19 Feb 2013
Since the 1st identification of a novel coronavirus in September 2012 [1], 4 confirmed cases had been identified in the United Kingdom (UK) by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) by [19 Feb 2013]: 2 imported cases and 2 indigenously acquired cases linked to the 2nd imported case.

"The 1st case of novel coronavirus identified in the UK was in a foreign national transferred to London for the treatment of a serious, unexplained respiratory illness in September 2012 [2]. Coronavirus testing was undertaken following the announcement that a new coronavirus had been discovered in a Saudi Arabian national with a similar illness. The patient was very unwell, requiring intensive care and extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and remains very unwell. Extensive follow up of all close contacts (household and health care) by the HPA identified a number of persons with mild respiratory illness in the 10 days following exposure but none of these contacts had novel coronavirus infection detected on respiratory sampling or serology [3].

"On [11 Feb 2013], the HPA published details of an adult UK resident (the index case), with confirmed novel coronavirus infection and influenza A infection, who had travelled to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia in the 10 days before illness onset. This individual had developed respiratory symptoms on [24 Jan 2013], prior to returning to the UK on [28 Jan 2013]. While staying with family at home in the UK, this individual's condition deteriorated and they were admitted to hospital in Birmingham, before being transferred to Manchester, where they remain in intensive care, with ECMO.

"On [6 Feb 2013], an adult household member of the case who had not recently travelled abroad -- but who had been in sustained close contact with the index case from their arrival in the UK until hospital admission -- became unwell with a febrile respiratory illness. This 3rd case, on admission to hospital in Birmingham, was confirmed to have novel coronavirus infection. Their condition worsened -- requiring intensive care and ECMO -- before the patient died on [17 Feb 2013]. This patient had an existing medical condition that may have made them more susceptible to a respiratory infection.

"On [5 Feb 2013], an adult member of the same extended family of the 2 confirmed cases -- who had not travelled abroad -- developed an influenza-like illness. The illness remained mild, not requiring hospital admission, and there has been a full recovery. A sputum sample from this case was later confirmed to contain novel coronavirus. This case had limited exposure to the index case on 3 occasions while the latter was in hospital, and had no contact with the 2nd case.

"Infection control measures around the 3 recent cases have followed UK national guidance [4] and contact tracing and follow-up is continuing for those persons who may have been in close contact with any of the 3 cases.

"Contacts in 3 main settings are being followed up:
- Aircraft: the aircraft passengers in the same row and the 2 rows in front and behind the case on a flight from Saudi Arabia to London when the 1st case had been unwell;
- Household: the family and friend household contacts of all 3 cases;
- Health care: the health care workers, patients and family and friends who were in contact with the cases in a health care setting.
- Follow-up of contacts of the 3 confirmed cases had not detected any further probable or confirmed secondary cases by [18 Feb 2013].

"The routes of transmission to humans of the novel coronavirus have not yet been fully determined, but the recent UK experience provides strong evidence of human-to-human transmission in at least some circumstances. The limited contact that one of the cases had with the index case, however, leaves open the possibility of an intermediary case within the extended family.

"The 3 recent cases in the UK represent an important opportunity to obtain more information about the characteristics of this infection in humans and risk factors for its acquisition, particularly in the light of the first ever recorded instance of apparently lower severity of illness in one of the cases, and the occurrence of dual infection in the index case.
