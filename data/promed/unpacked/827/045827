Cucurbit downy mildew was reported in an organic, commercial cucumber field in Buncombe County, North Carolina, and confirmed by Inga Meadows, Extension Plant Pathologist for Vegetables. Growers are recommended to take immediate action to protect cucurbit crops in NC. Typically, cucumbers, melons, and watermelons are more susceptible to the disease than squash and pumpkin.

Cucurbit downy mildew [CDM] was confirmed on cucumber in southern New Jersey (Cumberland County). This is the 2nd report of CDM in New Jersey this [2017] growing season. All cucumber growers in NJ are encouraged to add downy mildew specific fungicides to their weekly maintenance spray programs. All growers should scout cucumber plantings as well as all other cucurbit crops for symptoms. CDM has also been reported on cucumber in Maryland, Delaware, and Pennsylvania.

Cucurbit downy mildew has been confirmed in Eerie County (western New York state). There have also been confirmed reports from Ohio, Pennsylvania, and from Ontario, Canada. If you're planning on spraying cucumbers to control downy mildew, now is the time to do it.

[Cucurbit downy mildew (CDM) caused by the fungus-like organism (oomycete) _Pseudoperonospora cubensis_ is a devastating disease of these crops. _P. cubensis_ is found worldwide, but it is usually most damaging in tropical and subtropical areas. Different pathogen strains with variable host preferences (pathovars) seem to exist and, for example, a strain that affects cucumbers may not necessarily affect melons. By affecting the leaves and thus the photosynthetic potential of its host, downy mildew reduces yield and fruit quality and it can eventually kill the host plant. Under favourable conditions, plantings can be infected so rapidly that they appear to have been frosted.

The pathogen is an obligate parasite surviving on cultivated or wild cucurbits and volunteer crop plants, or cucurbit weeds may serve as sources of inoculum. The disease is spread by wind, rain splash, and mechanical means. Disease development can occur over a wide temperature range under conditions of high humidity. Control strategies include the use of resistant cultivars as well as applications of protectant and systemic fungicides.

In North America, new more virulent strains of CDM have been reported, for example in the US in 2007 (ProMED-mail post 20071023.3448) and in Canada in 2011 (ProMED-mail post 20110713.2115).
