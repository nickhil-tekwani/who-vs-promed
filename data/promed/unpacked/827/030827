Chilean authorities are investigating the deaths of nearly 1500
penguins. The dead birds were found on Saturday [28 Mar 2009] at
Caleta Queule, more than 1240 miles north of Antarctica. Experts from
the nearby University of Valdivia are working to determine what killed
them.

Navy Lt. Rodrigo Zambrano says experts from the nearby University of
Valdivia are working to determine what killed them. They did not know
immediately where the penguins were from.

University veterinarian Roberto Schlatter tells state television that
experts also are trying to establish the penguins' ages. It is not
unusual for some penguin species to migrate thousands of miles.

[2] 800 DEAD PENGUINS FOUND IN SOUTHERN CHILE

In just the past few days, hundreds of dead Magellanic penguins
(_Spheniscus magellanicus_) have washed ashore in Chile?s Region XI,
the daily La Tercera reported Sunday.

So far experts are in the dark about what's killing the sea birds,
more than 800 of which have been found on the beaches of Las Ni√±as and
Los Piojos near Queule.

Rodrigo Zambrano, a maritime official in Valdivia (Region XIV), said
the penguins do not appear to be poisoned in any way. He said
Magellanic penguins are periodically killed by fishing boat nets, but
never by the hundreds. 4 of the bird carcasses have been sent to
Valdivia?s Universidad Austral for testing.

Magellanic penguins are native to the waters around Chile and
Argentina. Although they are not an endangered species, they are
vulnerable to oil spills and ?- according to a penguin expert from the
University of Washington ?- climate change. Rising temperatures are
displacing fish, forcing Magellanic penguins to swim an average of 25
miles further from their nests in search of food, professor Dee
Boersma discovered. The extra "commute" is also shortening their
breeding period, she found.

starvation. We look forward to the veterinarians' report of the
findings on these birds. - Mod.TG
