The Florida Department of Health has received confirmation of the presence of enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) infection in an 8-year-old boy who resides in Escambia County, Florida. The Department advises parents, childcare workers, and healthcare professionals to be vigilant for respiratory virus infections such as enterovirus (EV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and influenza (flu).

Enterovirus D68 can cause difficulty breathing in infants and young children. Like RSV and the flu, EV-D68 is highly contagious and spreads through droplets in coughs or sneezes, or when someone touches a contaminated surface like a counter top or doorknob. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers and disinfectants have not been found to be effective against EV-D68. Frequent hand washing and the use of non-alcohol surface disinfectants are recommended. Enterovirus D68 has signs and symptoms that are similar to the common cold, influenza, or respiratory syncytial viruses. Adults and older children might have only mild signs such as a cough, stuffy nose, and low-grade fever. People with asthma, particularly children, are at increased risk for severe presentations of EV-D68 infection. In rare cases, EV infections may become serious enough to require hospitalization.

[For more information on EV-D68 in the USA, visit: http://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/outbreaks/EV-D68-outbreaks.html. A map of the distribution and density of EV-D68 cases by US state can be viewed at: http://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/outbreaks/EV-D68-activity.html. For an overview of EV-D68, see: http://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/about/EV-D68.html.

It is likely that the epidemiological picture will change during the next few weeks as the diagnosis capability increases when the updated rRT-PCR diagnostic test begins to catch up with the clinical sampling. Any relationship between EV-D68 and any specific clinical picture may then become apparent. - Mod.CP
