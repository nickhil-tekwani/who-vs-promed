Chile Says Anthrax Case Confirmed in Letter
-------------------------------------------
SANTIAGO, Chile - Chilean health authorities said on Monday they had
discovered the deadly bacteria anthrax in a letter sent from Florida to the
South American country. "The Public Health Institute has confirmed the
presence of anthrax spores in an envelope which came from abroad," Health
Minister Michelle Bachelet told a news conference. She said 13 people who
may have been exposed to the bacteria were taking antibiotics to counter
any effects but that none of them had shown signs of illness.
A government official said the envelope was addressed to what she called a
private office in Santiago and was discovered last week. It raised
suspicions because it appeared to carry a Swiss postage stamp but was
postmarked in Florida. Bachelet provided few other details on the case.
Elsewhere in Latin America, traces of anthrax were found in a mail bundle
at the U.S. Embassy in Peru in October.
