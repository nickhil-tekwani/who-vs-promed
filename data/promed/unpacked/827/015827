When the Dr Saimy Ismail says, "Until now..." it probably does NOT mean
there are now cases, as the moderator suggests. In Malaysian parlance, it
probably means "As of this moment, there are still no victims."

"Department director Dr Saimy Ismail said since 7 Mar 2000, several people
suffering from diarrhea were hospitalized. 'Until now, there have been no
victims of paralytic shellfish poisoning in the state,' he said. [His
statement, 'Until now' leads me to believe, indeed, there are now cases. -

Because verbs are not conjugated in Malaysian, they provide no information
about the sequence of events. Instead, sequence is indicated by
prepositions. These prepositions or prepositional phrases are sometimes
included by native Malaysian speakers when they translate their thoughts
into English, even though they are redundant if the verb is conjugated
correctly. In this case, "Until now," as used by Dr. Saimy, seems to be
such a redundant prepositional phrase merely intended
to indicate that there HAVE BEEN no victims. I strongly suspect Dr. Saimy
simply means, "There have been no victims of paralytic shellfish poisoning
in the state." I do not think his use of "Until now" should lead anyone to
make any inference, one way or the other, about the possible existence of
new cases.
