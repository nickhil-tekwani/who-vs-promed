The Ghana Health Service has assured no further deaths at Kumasi Academy as students undergo [treatment with] azithromycin, a broad-spectrum antibiotics medication.

[Ashanti] Regional Health Director, Dr Emmanuel Tinkorang, says every student at Kumasi Academy [KUMACA] will survive the attack of a suspected bacterial infection, which has claimed lives of at least 11 students. Over 40 students have been affected, with 19 currently on admission at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) Hospital and Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital.

The assurance comes as students and teachers undergo antibiotics medication supplied by the World Health Organization. They are expected to complete the 3-dose medication they started on [Tue 5 Dec 2017].

Nineteen students, 16 on admission at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology Hospital and 3 at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital are said to be responding to treatment. Their high body temperatures are said to have normalised after taking azithromycin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic. With these actions taken, Dr Tinkorang is full of hope that no student will die again at Kumasi Academy. "Every child will survive in this school. No child will die. I must assure you. Once you take the treatment, there would be no problem. Everybody will survive," he assured.

Dr Tinkorang was speaking on [Tue 5 Dec 2017] during a meeting with parents, students, and teachers of KUMACA to begin the antibiotic medication. The Ministry of Education announced the school would be closed down to enable health officials to carry thorough investigations and surveillance in the school.

The Health Minister, Kwaku Agyemang-Manu, has said the Kumasi Academy will not be closed down as stated earlier. The Ashanti Regional Minister, Simon Osei Mensah had told Luv News' Ohemeng Tawiah earlier that authorities were considering closing down the school on [Thu 30 Nov 2017].

Joy News' Parliamentary Correspondent, Joseph Opoku Gapko, however, reports the Health Minister as saying adequate measures are being put in place to contain the situation, which has so far cost government GHS 100 000 [about USD 22 000]. Frantic efforts are being made to ascertain the cause of deaths at the school following the outbreak of an 'unknown' illness.

So far, 4 students -- 3 boys and a girl -- have lost their lives to the illness doctors at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital have described as the 1st of its kind in Ghana. Some 18 other students are on admission, while 6 have been treated and discharged.

The female student who died yesterday [5 Dec 2017] is reported to have had a high body temperature and died after she was rushed to the hospital.

School and health authorities are undertaking a screening and treatment exercise for students. A number of students who left the school returned this morning [6 Dec 2017] to take part in the screening and treatment. They will, however, return to their various homes after school closes today and return tomorrow for teaching and learning to continue.

Already, most of the students have taken a broad-spectrum antibiotics being administered by health authorities. They suspect the cause of the deaths is a bacterial infection and they believe the antibiotics being administered will weaken it. Although the specific illness is still not known, health authorities expect each student to take the antibiotic before they go home to prevent the spread of the disease in case it is contagious. Tests are still being run and health authorities are hopeful that they will soon arrive at the real cause of the situation.

Ohemeng said the panic-stricken parents are cooperating with school and health authorities although they say there has been a lack of transparency on the issue. The recent deaths bring the total number of deaths in the school since March this year [2017] when the 'mysterious' illness broke to 11.

Ashanti Regional Minister, Simon Osei Mensah, has summoned a crisis meeting on the health situation in Kumasi Academy (KUMACA) after another student died this morning [5 Dec 2017]. The Minister is expected to meet with health officials and education authorities to explore ways to prevent more deaths in the school.

The death of a female student [Tue 5 Dec 2017] brings to 11 the total number of deaths recorded in KUMACA since March [2017]. She reportedly had increased body temperature but she died after she was rushed to a hospital.

There were reports meningitis was the cause of the deaths, but autopsy reports released on two of the bodies did not support that claim. Nhyira FM's Ohemeng Tawiah reported the examination conducted by a senior pathologist in Kumasi was not able to establish the cause of death, which further heightened the concerns of school authorities.

Already, parents and guardians have thronged the school to withdraw their wards.

But Asokore Mampong Municipal Chief Executive, Alidu Seidu, has said any parent who would want to take the ward will be required to sign a form to that effect. The situation has triggered concerns in Parliament, with lawmakers asking for Health Minister, Kwaku Agyeman Manu, to be summoned over the matter.

Asawase Member of Parliament, Muntaka Mubarak Mohammed, said he has been inundated with calls over the health situation in the school. "Fear and panic by students, by parents, and school authorities," he told his colleagues in parliament, expressing worry that the release of students to their parents will jeopardize public safety. But the Health Minister who appeared before Parliament, later [Tue 5 Dec 2017] has pleaded for more time to ascertain the cause of deaths in the school.

"As I speak the heads of public health are all in Kumasi... I will need a little bit of time to get the report," he said, adding samples taken after the postmortem have been sent to the Noguchi Memorial Institute in Accra for further examination. He said because of the delicate nature of the situation, it would be a "bit na√Øve" on his part to give timelines.

[The news report above says that the outbreak at the Kumasi Academy in Kumasi, Ghana has resulted in 4 dead students -- 3 boys and a girl; 19 other students still hospitalized; and 6 students treated and discharged. The hospitalized students are said to have had high-grade fever on admission, but we are not otherwise told the clinical manifestations of this illness, which is nevertheless thought to be bacterial infection that is now being treated with a 3-day course of azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, to which the hospitalized students are said to have responded.

Autopsies on 2 of the 4 Kumasi students who died recently are said to have ruled out meningitis, but failed to yield a cause of death. Azithromycin is now apparently being given to all students and teachers at the school, although we are not told specifically the indication for this drug.

The outbreak is said to have started in March 2017 when there were 7 deaths among students at Kumasi Academy to bring the current total to 11 fatalities (please see ProMED-mail post Meningitis - Ghana: (AH) fatal, high school students, RFI 20170407.4953952)

Kumasi Academy is a public secondary boarding school located in Asokore-Mampong, a suburb of the city of Kumasi, the capital of the Ashanti Region of Ghana (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumasi_Academy). Maps of Ghana can be seen at http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/africa/political-map-of-Ghana.gif and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=5489284,2900. The Ashanti region is located in south-central Ghana and is 3rd largest of 10 administrative regions, with a population of about 3.6 million residents in 2000, accounting for 19.1 percent of Ghana's total population (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashanti_Region).

More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML]
