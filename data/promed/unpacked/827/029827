Bacterial canker and worms threatening chestnut production in Bierzo
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A study by the Energy City Foundation (Ciuden) and the University of
Leon [UL] noted that the chestnut region of Bierzo in Leon is
threatened by the canker bacterium attacking the trees, as well as
fruit worms, with some 1.3 million trees affected. The situation
would require a phytosanitary control plan to maintain an
"acceptable" level of production this [2010] season.

The canker, the report said, is the most worrying disease and is
already present in more than 90 percent of the area affecting almost
82 percent of chestnut trees. "The current management practices of
chestnut trees seem to be the main cause of the expansion, especially
grafting and pruning. Branches are cut too much and then wounds are
not protected, which favours the spread of the disease," said Jorge Tizado, UL.

Losses of up to one million euros [USD 1.23 million] were incurred in
2009 in the region. Sweet chestnut is one of the products
characteristic for Bierzo and is part of the natural heritage of the
region. It is therefore necessary to develop an action plan to
prevent the spread of diseases, especially canker which first
appeared in the region in 1978 and was declared an agricultural
problem in 2005. 90 000 trees have been counted as killed by the disease.

[Bacterial canker of sweet chestnut (_Castanea_ species, in Europe
_C. sativa_) is caused by _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _castaneae_. The
pathogen was first identified in 1989 in Japan on _C. crenata_ and
exact taxonomy of the pathovar remains to be confirmed. Symptoms were
described to include cankers on succulent shoots resulting either in
outright bud death without sprouting, or in blight on terminal leaves
just after sprouting followed by small galls with rough surface
developing on the shoot as well as petioles and midribs of leaves and
flower clusters.

Different pathovars (strains) of _P. syringae_ can affect a wide
variety of plants and new diseases are emerging frequently. Symptoms
may include leaf specks, blights, and cankers on crops such as
tomato, bean, maize, mango, soybean, citrus, and stone fruit. The
pathogens are generally spread by water, wind, mechanical means
(including animal and human activities such as pruning), and infected
planting material. Disease management usually includes cultural
practices, crop rotation, phytosanitation to prevent spread (for
example, in the case above disinfection of pruning tools would be
vital), and use of clean planting material. Chemical control (copper
compounds, antibiotics) may be effective, but resistant strains have
emerged for some pathovars. Varieties with different levels of
resistance are available for some crops.
