The Australian Veterinary Association (AVA) wants all dog owners to be aware of a very serious infection of dogs, leptospirosis, which has been detected across NSW [New South Wales] with diagnoses on the Central Coast, Central and Northern beaches areas of Sydney and more recently NSW South Coast. The AVA is suggesting all resident and visiting dogs in these areas be vaccinated against this frequently fatal disease.

Two dogs living in the St George's Basin area of the NSW South Coast were recently diagnosed with leptospirosis, the 1st occurrence of this disease on the South Coast. Unfortunately, they were unable to be saved, because despite appropriate treatment, it is often too late to reverse the severe damage the disease causes.

This bacterial disease affects the liver and kidneys, sometimes the respiratory system and brain. Common clinical signs may include vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, jaundice, inappetence, changed frequency of urination and nosebleeds. The bacterium is most commonly spread through contact with soil, water or vegetation which has been contaminated with urine from infected animals, commonly rats and mice. In the recent outbreak, many of the infected dogs have not survived.

"Vaccination offers protection against leptospirosis," said Dr Zachary Lederhose of the Australian Veterinary Association NSW Division Committee.

"Vaccination, combined with preventing dogs swimming or playing in lakes, ponds or other sources of stagnant water (which could be contaminated) can help minimise the risk of leptospirosis infection," said Dr Michael Hayward, President of the Australian Veterinary Association ACT Division.

Please contact your local veterinarian to confirm whether your dog's vaccinations are up to date or to get more information about vaccinating your dog for a variety of deadly diseases including leptospirosis.

[Getting your dog vaccinated is critically important, but the vaccine may not be effective if it does not match the circulating serovar. It does depend on which serovars are in the vaccine and which are the cause of the problem.

"Prevention of leptospirosis via vaccination is complicated by the fact that _Leptospira interrogans_ has more than 200 subtypes causing illness in animals and people. The available vaccines protect against only a handful of the most common subtypes infecting dogs, which limits their protective value. Nevertheless, the available vaccines are effective and safe when used as directed, and many veterinarians recommend the vaccination for dogs at risk for exposure." (http://www.vetstreet.com/care/leptospirosis-vaccine-for-dogs)

"Leptospirosis is more common in areas with warm climates and high annual rainfall, but it can occur anywhere.

"Dogs are most commonly affected. Leptospirosis in cats is rare and appears to be mild, although very little is known about the disease in this species. [However, it is known cats can die from this disease, and currently there is no vaccine for cats. - Mod.TG]. Common risk factors for leptospirosis in dogs residing in the United States [and likely anywhere - Mod.TG] include exposure to or drinking from rivers, lakes, or streams; roaming on rural properties (because of exposure to potentially infected wildlife, farm animals, or water sources); exposure to wild animal or farm animal species, even if in the backyard; and contact with rodents or other dogs.[(Other exposure risks would be flood waters. Often in flooded areas, rodents, which frequently carry leptospirosis, are involved, and pets may not have clean sources of water in such disaster situations. - Mod.TG].

"Dogs can become infected and develop leptospirosis if their mucous membranes (or skin with any wound, such as a cut or scrape) come into contact with infected urine, urine-contaminated soil, water, food, or bedding; through a bite from an infected animal; by eating infected tissues or carcasses; and rarely, through breeding. It can also be passed through the placenta from the mother dog to the puppies.

"The signs of leptospirosis in dogs vary. Some infected dogs do not show any signs of illness; some have a mild and transient illness and recover spontaneously, while others develop severe illness and death.

"Signs of leptospirosis may include fever, shivering, muscle tenderness, reluctance to move, increased thirst, changes in the frequency or amount of urination, dehydration, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, lethargy, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes), or painful inflammation within the eyes. The disease can cause kidney failure with or without liver failure. Dogs may occasionally develop severe lung disease and have difficulty breathing. Leptospirosis can cause bleeding disorders, which can lead to blood-tinged vomit, urine, stool or saliva; nosebleeds; and pinpoint red spots (which may be visible on the gums and other mucous membranes or on light-colored skin). Affected dogs can also develop swollen legs (from fluid accumulation) or accumulate excess fluid in their chest or abdomen.

"Leptospirosis may be suspected based on the exposure history and signs shown by the dog, but many of these signs can also be seen with other diseases. In addition to a physical examination, your veterinarian may recommend several other tests such as blood tests, urine tests, radiographs (x-rays), and an ultrasound examination.

"Leptospirosis is generally treated with antibiotics and supportive care. When treated early and aggressively, the chances for recovery are good but there is still a risk of permanent residual kidney or liver damage.

"Currently available vaccines effectively prevent leptospirosis and protect dogs for at least 12 months. Annual vaccination is recommended for at-risk dogs. Reducing your dog's exposure to possible sources of the _leptospira_ bacteria can reduce its chances of infection.

"Although an infected pet dog presents a low risk of infection for you and your family, there is still some risk. If your dog has been diagnosed with leptospirosis, take the following precautions to protect yourself:
- administer antibiotics as prescribed by your veterinarian;
- avoid contact with your dog's urine;
- if your dog urinates in your home, quickly clean the area with a household disinfectant and wear gloves to avoid skin contact with the urine;
- encourage your dog to urinate away from standing water or areas where people or other animals will have access;
- wash your hands after handling your pet.

"If you are ill or if you have questions about leptospirosis in people, consult your physician. If you are pregnant or immunocompromised (due to medications, cancer treatment, HIV or other conditions), consult your physician for advice."

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that occurs worldwide. The disease is transmitted to humans by contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes usually with water or soil contaminated by the urine of infected animals. Carrier animals, such as rats, dogs, or cattle, are mostly asymptomatic but chronically infected with one of the several hundred serovars of pathogenic _leptospira_. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions. In carrier animals with chronic renal infections, _leptospira_ are excreted in urine for long periods or for the life of the animal. Leptospira can survive for weeks to months in warm fresh water or soil flooded with fresh water. Drinking contaminated water or food can also cause infection. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow flooding after heavy rainfall, for example, during the monsoon season (July-October).

Treatment with antibiotics (penicillin and doxycycline) can be effective, especially if started early in the disease. For very ill patients, intensive care support and intravenous (IV) antibiotics may be necessary. In a flood-affected area, leptospirosis chemoprophylaxis is 200 mg of doxycycline, once a week for those exposed to contaminated floodwater or soil (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/travel-related-infectious-diseases/leptospirosis). Each 200 mg dose provides a benefit for up to 7 days, so the dose may be repeated if high-risk conditions persist longer than this.

Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of leptospirosis, its diagnosis cannot be made confidently without laboratory confirmation. The _Leptospira_ Dip-S-Tick (DST) IgM dot-ELISA test kits (PanBio Integrated Diagnostics) can provide in-the-field testing of suspected patients (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC149700/). Confirmatory testing uses the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). Molecular assays such as DNA PCR can also be used, if available. - Mod.TG with assistance from Mod.ML
