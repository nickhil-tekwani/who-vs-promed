WJZ.COM has learned a horse at Bowie training center is showing signs
of the herpes virus that has plagued Pimlico and Laurel Park over the
past month. WJZ'S Alex DeMetrick spoke spoke to Magna officials, who
are working with the Maryland Jockey club, who confirm that the state
of Maryland has placed an investigational hold order at Barn one of
the Bowie training center.
The Maryland Department of Agriculture placed an initial hold the
this afternoon after a horse showed symptoms of equine herpesvirus
(EHV-1). Equine herpesvirus-1 (also known as "rhino"), which causes
upper respiratory infection, can also cause neurological disease.
The horse, trained by Chris Grove, had lameness after it last raced
then began showing neurologic signs late last week. After discussions
with his private veterinarian, the trainer decided to relocate his
horse to an empty barn behind the Bowie grandstand as a precautionary
measure. Grove indicated his horse was feeling energetic, "bucking
and kicking" when he walked his horse to the isolated barn. Blood
samples and nasal swabs were taken on the horse Wednesday afternoon.
Results should be available early next week. Until then none of the
29 horses in Grove's barn will be allowed to race at Laurel Park.
Grove has elected not to train any of his horses until the results of
the tests are revealed.
4 horses have been euthanized at the major Maryland tracks this year,
3 at Pimlico Race Course and one at Laurel Park . Another horse was
put down last week at a Kent County farm.
8 horses remain isolated in the Pimlico Detention Barn suffering from
various levels of the virus. Barns 5, 6, and A at Pimlico remain
under state hold orders. The Maryland Jockey Club proactively placed
the historic Baltimore oval on quarantine on 21 Jan 2006, restricting
the movement of horses. There have been no new cases of EHV-1 at
Pimlico since 19 Jan.
At Laurel Park where live racing is being conducted, Barn 9 is also
under a Hold Order. Rodney Jenkins, whose horses are stabled in that
barn, will train the 35 horses he conditions inside the barn until
the restrictions are lifted.
"Conditions at Pimlico and Laurel continue to progress in a positive
manner," said Maryland State Veterinarian Guy Hohenhaus. "Today's
news at Bowie does not change our plans to try to clear Barn 5 at
Pimlico next week after test results are returned."
There is currently no known method to reliably prevent the neurologic
form of EHV-1 infection. It is recommended to maintain appropriate
vaccination procedures in an attempt to reduce the incidence of the
respiratory form of EHV-1 infection, which may help prevent the
neurologic form. Transmission of the virus can occur via coughing or
sneezing over a distance of up to 35 feet as well as by direct
contact with infected horses, feed and equipment. Based on clinical
signs, there is no reason to believe that there is any human health risk.

WJZ.COM has learned the former trainer of the horse in question at
Bowie Training Center told Maryland Jockey Club Chief Operating
officer Lou Raffetto that he had been treating the horse for Equine
Protozoal Myeloencephalitis (EPM). Chris Grove did not know this when
claiming the horse in November 2005, and the horse has been off the
medicine since being claimed. This could be a reaction to being off
the medicine.
EPM is an infection of the central nervous system of horses. The
neurologic signs that it causes are most commonly asymmetric
incoordination (ataxia), weakness and spasticity, although they may
mimic almost any neurologic condition. Clinical signs among horses
with EPM include a wide array of symptoms that may result from
primary or secondary problems. Some of the signs cannot be
distinguished from other problems, such as lameness. Airway
abnormalities, such as laryngeal hemiplegia (paralyzed flaps), dorsal
displacement of the soft palate (snoring), or airway noise of
undetermined origin may result from protozoa infecting the nerves
which innervate the throat. Apparent lameness, particularly atypical
lameness or slight gait asymmetry of the rear limbs, is commonly
caused by EPM. Focal muscle atrophy, or even generalized muscle
atrophy or loss of condition may result. Secondary signs also occur
with neurologic disease. Upward fixation of the patella (locking up
of the stifle) is among the most common findings among horses with
neurologic disease. Another common side effect of EPM is back
soreness, which can be severe. Even typical racing injuries may
ultimately be caused by EPM, because horses which are uncoordinated
are much more likely to "take a bad step" in racing or training.
Therefore, any horse with these signs should be carefully evaluated
for the presence of neurologic disease.

Horses at Charles Town [West Virginia] Races & Slots have been
quarantined to prevent the animals from contracting equine
herpesvirus, which has surfaced in racehorses in nearby Maryland,
track officials said. The action prevents breeders from bringing
horses to the track, and no horses can leave the track to race
elsewhere and return, said John Finamore, senior vice president of
regional operations for Penn National Gaming Inc., which owns the
track. About 1500 to 2000 horses are kept at Charles Town, which is
enough to keep entries up. Track officials could not say how long the
quarantine would be in place.
3 horses at Maryland's Pimlico Race Course have been euthanized
because of the virus. The virus also was discovered at another
Maryland track, Laurel Park.
Horses coming to the Eastern Panhandle track are checked at security
gates. The quarantine is enforced using papers that must accompany
horses arriving at the track, Finamore said. "We just think it's in
the best interest of preserving the racing product," he said.
