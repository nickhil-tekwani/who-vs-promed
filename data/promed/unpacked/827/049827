WEST NILE VIRUS, BIRDS - MEXICO (YUCATAN): CORRECTION
**********************************************
A ProMED-mail post

The AP newswire report (quoted in the ProMED-mail post referenced below)
unfortunately omitted the fact that the birds were collected in 2001. We
have heard from a reliable source that they were southbound migratory birds
arriving in Mexico from the Eastern USA, where WNV was already widespread
last year, so it would not be surprising to find antibody evidence of past
infection with WNV.
Definitive neutralization test results on the specimens are still pending.
