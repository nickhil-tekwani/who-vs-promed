Hand, foot and mouth disease kills 156 in Viet Nam
--------------------------------------------------
Viet Nam authorities say an outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease
has killed 156 people, mostly children, and sickened more than 96 000
through late November 2011. An official at the Ministry of Health says
the average number of weekly cases dropped from about 3000 in
September to 2460 in November.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a travel
alert on Monday urging people visiting Viet Nam to protect themselves
from the disease by practicing "healthy personal hygiene."

This year's outbreak is a sharp contrast to recent years. Since 2008,
about 10 000 to 15 000 cases were reported per year with about 20 to
30 children dying annually. This common childhood illness typically
causes little more than a fever and rash, and most recover quickly.

[Since the end of October 2011 the number of cases of hand, foot and
mouth disease in Viet Nam has increased from 77 895 to more than 96
000 and the number of fatalities from 137 to 156. This is in contrast
to the 10 000 to 15 000 cases and 20-30 deaths reported annually since
2008. The 2011 outbreak appears to involve all 63 provinces of Viet
Nam. It is unclear from the information released so far whether the
current outbreak is a consequence of social and environmental factors,
or enhanced virulence of the causative agent, believed to be human
enterovirus 71. Are Viet Nam's neighbours similarly afflicted?
