Rabbit haemorrhagic disease [RHD] has been diagnosed during May [2018] in various locations in Israel. RHD is a deadly, highly contagious disease that affects rabbits and is caused by a calcivirus (an RNA virus).

Dead rabbits were submitted to the Kimron Veterinary Institute where necropsies, in the department of pathology, revealed multiple hemorrhages in various organs; final diagnosis was obtained in KVI's Virology Division by PCR. Further genotyping is to be applied.

The virus strain known to be circulating in Europe since 2010 is RHDV2, against which a vaccine has recently been developed, registered in France and Spain. When genotyping in Israel is completed, it will become known if this vaccine, commercially available, could be applied locally.

RHD is reportable in Israel, and is included in OIE's list of notifiable diseases. The disease has been previously reported in Israel in 1991 and 2006.

[The circular, signed by Israel's CVO/Director Veterinary Services, Dr. Michel Bellaiche, includes also extensive explanatory comments on the clinical signs, epidemiology, history, and other detailed information on RHD, as well as official instructions to the animal owners and to veterinarians, addressing the control and prevention of the disease. From now on, submission of samples for diagnosis to the KVI will be liable to payment].

[For further information on RHD, including diagnostic techniques and requirements for vaccines, subscribers are referred to OIE's Terrestrial Manual chapter 2.6.2. "Rabbit haemorrhagic disease", adopted by the General Assembly in May 2016, available at
http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.06.02_RHD.pdf.

The event has been notified to the OIE on 29 May 2018; the report has been circulated today, 30 May 2018 (see at
http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=26732).

For OIE's multi-annual RHD outbreaks map, as accumulated since Jan 2014, see https://tinyurl.com/y8fy8jgw. This map has been already updated with the new event in Israel.

As long as the etiology of the event was unknown, diagnostic services at the KVI were free of charge. The payment, required from now on, is required by Israel's government. One wonders if such payment may discourage animal owners from the continued submission of samples, with consequent decreased or lost epidemiological information on this, officially notifiable, disease. - Mod.AS
