Rabid dog is reminder to owners to vaccinate
--------------------------------------------
A dog in Barton County, Kansas, has tested positive for rabies
following a fight with a skunk 3 weeks ago. The dog had not been
vaccinated against rabies. 8 people who came in contact with the dog
are receiving rabies vaccinations as a precaution.

The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) wants to
remind everyone who owns pets and livestock to make sure their
animals are vaccinated against rabies by a veterinarian. Vaccines are
available for dogs, cats, ferrets, horses, cattle and sheep.
Vaccinated animals need to have periodic boosters of vaccine to
maintain proper protection. Some cities and counties have ordinances
that require proof of rabies vaccination for pets.

During 2009, the Kansas State Rabies Laboratory reported 78 cases of
animal rabies in Kansas. The rabid animals included 58 skunks, 5
bats, 4 dogs, 3 cats, 3 cows, and one of each of the following:
raccoon, bobcat, horse, fox and coyote.

"We often forget the importance of vaccinating our pets," said Dr.
Ingrid Garrison, state public health veterinarian. "Vaccinating
animals against rabies not only protects our pets, but our families as well."

KDHE offer these tips to prevent rabies:
* Have your veterinarian vaccinate all dogs, cats, ferrets, horses
and valuable breeding stock (cattle and sheep) against rabies.
* If bitten by an animal, seek medical attention and report the bite
to your local public health department or animal control department
immediately.
* If your animal is bitten, contact your veterinarian for advice.
* If you wake up in a room with a bat present, regardless if there is
evidence of a bite or scratch, seek medical attention. If at all
possible trap the bat for testing. Do not release the bat.
* Do not handle or feed wild animals. Never adopt wild animals or
bring them into your home.
* Do not try to nurse sick wild animals to health. Call animal
control or an animal rescue agency for assistance.
* Teach children never to handle unfamiliar animals, wild or
domestic, even if they appear friendly.

For more information about rabies, contact your veterinarian, local
health department or the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.
