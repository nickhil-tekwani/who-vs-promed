There are now 14 confirmed cases of mumps in the area and the illness has impacted students at at least 3 local schools, according to the local health unit.

Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health reported Tue 23 Jun 2015 that the volume of local mumps cases has risen and students at the Bishop Macdonell, John F. Ross and Our Lady of Lourdes high schools in Guelph are tied to the outbreak.

"Public Health continues to monitor suspect cases in other area high schools (as well)," according to a release issued by the agency. In connection with the announcement, the health unit also issued a call for area students to quickly notify their family doctors if symptoms develop. These include fever, salivary gland swelling and sensitivity, headaches and cold-like symptoms.

"We want students to fully participate in summer jobs, volunteering or school, but we also want to stop the outbreak of this potentially serious disease. Students who are off to summer jobs or volunteer opportunities should call and advise their family physician if they begin to develop symptoms, particularly if they are spending the summer around young children or someone with an underlying medical condition," said Dr. Nicola Mercer, Medical Officer of Health of Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health, in statement issued on Tuesday. "If they are attending summer school, students need to be fully vaccinated or they may be excluded from attending class if there is another confirmed case linked to that school."

The 14 confirmed cases are the 1st locally since 2010. With the cases being so far restricted to students and with the end of classes just days away, the health unit predicted in its release Tuesday that "mumps won't be on a summer holiday."

"This particular disease is spread by (respiratory) droplets," Mercer said in a telephone interview. Young people may share things like spoons, drinking straws and kisses. "These are all activities where they're sharing saliva or sharing droplets."

Where mumps is present, that presents a potential risk. Precautions aside from vaccination? "If you're sick, then you should stay home, so you don't give the disease to other people," Mercer said. "If you cough into your elbow or sneeze into your elbow, wash your hands,"
she continued. Remind others to do so, as well.

Mumps is an acute viral illness, preventable through vaccination, the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care advises. That's the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine.

"Before routine vaccination for mumps was introduced, mumps was a common infection in infants, children and young adults," the Ministry advises on its website. The illness is spread through person-to-person contact, notably coughing and sneezing that scatters infected droplets through the air. The vaccine's been available since the late 1960s. The College of Family Physicians of Ontario reported in a 2011 journal article by Dr. Scott Smith that mumps had over a decade reappeared in clusters in Canada, the U.S. and Britain.

"Outbreaks in Canada have predominantly affected adolescents and young adults, in part because these individuals are too young to have acquired natural immunity from childhood exposure but too old to have received the benefit of the 2-dose MMR vaccine," it stated.

Mumps made international headlines late in 2014 when 9 National Hockey League players became afflicted.

[The city of Guelph is a community of over 120 000 people situated in the heart of southern Ontario, just 100 km west of Toronto.

Mumps symptoms typically appear 16 to 18 days after infection, but this period can range from 12 to 25 days after infection. Mumps is best known for the swelling of the cheeks and jaw that it causes, which is a result of parotitis (inflammation of the salivary glands). Mumps also causes fever and headache. Mumps can be contagious from 7 days before and up to 5 days after the salivary glands begin to swell. Up to half of people who get mumps have very mild or no symptoms, and therefore do not know they were infected with mumps.

People who show symptoms usually recover after a week or 2, but mumps can occasionally cause serious complications. The most common complication is orchitis (swelling of the testicles) in males who have reached puberty; rarely does this lead to fertility problems. Other rare complications include encephalitis (swelling of the brain) and/or meningitis (swelling of the tissue covering the brain and spinal cord) and oophoritis (swelling of the ovaries) in females who have reached puberty; and deafness. Mumps infection during the 1st trimester of pregnancy may increase the risk of a miscarriage.

The MMR vaccine is a 3-in-1 vaccine that protects against measles, mumps and rubella (German measles). It should be given to children soon after their 1st birthday. A 2nd dose is given in combination with varicella (chicken pox), as MMRV (a 4-in-1 vaccine) at 4-6 years of age. Vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella is required by law for all children attending school in Ontario (unless exempted) (http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/public/publications/immune/mmr.aspx. - Mod.CP
