Contagious equine metritis, United Kingdom
------------------------------------------
Report type: immediate notification
Started: 9 Jun 2021
Confirmed: 9 Jun 2021
Reported: 10 Jun 2021
Reason for notification: recurrence of a listed disease
Last occurrence: 6 Apr 2020
Causal agent: _Taylorella equigenitalis_
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory
This event pertains to the whole country.

New outbreaks (1)
Outbreak location 1: West Devon, Devon, England
Started: 9 Jun 2021
Ended: ongoing
Epidemiological unit: other
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Equidae / 26 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: equine breeding premises: 23 breeding mares 3 breeding stallions 2 foals at foot.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreaks(s): introduction of new live animals
Epidemiological comments: Arab stallion imported on [22 Oct 2020]. The stallion was tested at the owner's request as a result of a tracing notification of a CEM [contagious equine metritis] positive stallion in another European country from the same provider. A positive result from a private laboratory (Axiom) initiated official sampling/ testing at the UK National Reference Laboratory. 2 further stallions at the establishment tested negative. PCR positive stallion covered 3 mares -- 2 are now in foal and will be tested and monitored. Affected animals and those under investigation are under restrictions. Weekly testing and antibiotic treatment will continue until all animals test negative on PCR. No germinal products or live animals have been exported from this establishment since the affected stallion arrived. Courtesy information will be passed on to the country of origin.

Control measures at event level
Domestic control measures applied: movement control inside the country; traceability
Domestic control measures to be applied: disinfection

Diagnostic test results

["Contagious equine metritis is an inflammatory disease of the proximal and distal reproductive tract of the mare caused by _Taylorella equigenitalis_, which usually results in temporary infertility. It is a nonsystemic infection, the effects of which are restricted to the reproductive tract of the mare.

"When present, clinical signs include endometritis, cervicitis, and vaginitis of variable severity and a slight to copious mucopurulent vaginal discharge. Recovery is uneventful, but prolonged asymptomatic or symptomatic carriage is established in a proportion of infected mares. Direct venereal contact during natural mating presents the highest risk for the transmission of _T. equigenitalis_ from a contaminated stallion or an infected mare. Direct venereal transmission can also take place by artificial insemination using infective raw, chilled, and possibly frozen semen. Indirectly, the infection may be acquired through fomite transmission, manual contamination, inadequate observance of appropriate biosecurity measures at the time of breeding and at semen collection centres.

"Stallions can become asymptomatic carriers of _T. equigenitalis_. The principal sites of colonisation by the bacterium are the urogenital membranes (urethral fossa, urethral sinus, terminal urethra, and penile sheath). The sites of persistence of _T. equigenitalis_ in the majority of carrier mares are the clitoral sinuses and fossa and infrequently the uterus. Foals born of carrier mares may also become carriers. The organism can infect equid species other than horses, such as donkeys".
