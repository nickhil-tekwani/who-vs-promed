[This posting was erroneously titled "Yellow fever - Ecuador: alert," as
the information in the newswire was about communities in Ecuador on alert
because of an outbreak of yellow fever in neighboring Colombia. We have
changed the title to "Yellow fever - Colombia (Putomayo): alert" to reflect
the true location of the outbreak.
ProMED-mail apologizes for any confusion that may have been caused by this
error. - Mod.MPP]
