A 32-year-old resident of the Kosh-Terek village, Ala-Buka district,
Jalalabad region has been taken to hospital with anthrax symptoms,
the Emergency Ministry of Kyrgyzstan reported.

At least 42 families residing in the village have also been put under
medical observation, while 3 medical teams continue door-to-door
visits and explanatory work, the ministry said.

[Late October is usually well outside the normal "anthrax season" of
hot, dry summer weather. However, this 2nd peak typically occurs when
livestock are brought down from their high altitude summer grazing
and trailed back to their communities of origin for the winter. The
grazing along these relatively narrow seasonal trails can be sparse
at this time of year, with the large numbers of stock traipsing
through. This brings these animals through areas which have had
anthrax at this time in years past, and, stressed by the distance and
lack of food, a less than average exposure can kill them. And then
the herder has to recover the hide and meat to persuade the owner
that he didn't lose the animal. Jalalabad is an oblast with frequent
outbreaks.
