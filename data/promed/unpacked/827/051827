Health Ministry unfazed by mumps
--------------------------------
There have been 3400 reported cases of the mumps since January
[2010], 2400 of them in the Jerusalem area alone -- compared to 6 to
10 cases during an ordinary year, according to National Council for
the Child Chairman Dr. Yitzhak Kadman.

Kadman asked the Health Ministry this week [19-23 Jul 2010] for an
explanation, since the mumps/measles/rubella (MMR) vaccine is
generally given to protect children from these infectious viral
disease.

Last November [2009], the Health Ministry's epidemiology department
issued a directive about mumps, saying that within the 2 months
before that date, there had been an outbreak of the disease, that 78
percent of the patients had been males aged 10 to 24 -- and that most
had occurred in haredi yeshivot [orthodox religious boarding schools
for males] in Jerusalem, Bnei Brak, Petah Tikva and Modi'in Illit.

The number of cases in kindergartens and schools has been small, Dr.
Itamar Grotto, the Ministry's Chief of Public Health, told The
Jerusalem Post on Thursday [22 Jul 2010].

"The origin of the outbreak was in haredi yeshivot in Brooklyn, New
York, and in New Jersey [see ProMED-mail references below. - Mod.CP],
but there are also reports of mumps out of Holland, England, and
Germany in recent months that had nothing to do with the haredi
community," he asserted.

"We are not worried," Grotto added. "It is under control." The number
of cases has been on the decline since March [2010]. The Ministry
urges everyone to make sure children get vaccinated with the MMR
vaccine, even though no vaccine offers 100 percent protection, and
this particular vaccine is less effective than others that protect
against childhood diseases. [This is true only of the mumps component
of the triple vaccine. - Mod.CP] Most people who get the MMR vaccine
at age one and age 6 are protected against mumps, Grotto assured.

The Ministry has sent information in recent months to the haredi
media and to rabbis and yeshivot.

[The situation in Jerusalem does not appear to be unique. Most
recently in August 2009, an outbreak of mumps originating in a summer
camp in Sullivan County, New York state, became the largest mumps
outbreak since 2006, when the United States experienced an outbreak
of mumps with 6584 reported cases. The outbreak primarily affected
members of a tradition-observant (Jewish) religious community, in
spite of a high level of vaccination (see MMWR, November 12, 2009 /
58(Dispatch); 1-4 available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm58d1112a1.htm?s_cid=mm58d1112a1_e>).
Elsewhere similar outbreaks have occurred in colleges and schools
where children and young adults may be living in close contact.

Over 4 months up to mid-January 2010 some 600 cases of mumps had been
reported in the Jerusalem district and more than 850 nationally in
Israel, the majority of whom (70 percent) have been male. Case
investigation showed that the outbreak emerged in male-attended
religious high schools and colleges (yeshivas). In view of the fact
that the number of cases since January has risen to 3400 (2400 in the
Jerusalem area) the Ministry of Health's optimism seems misplaced.
