The Ministry of Public Health issued this Thursday [8 Apr 2021] an epidemiological alert to the occurrence of 10 diphtheria cases in different parts of the country, of which 4 have been confirmed, and 6 remain under investigation.

These cases have been reported so far in 2021, until this Epidemiological Week (EW), number 14 [29 Mar-4 Apr 2021]. Of the 10 notifications, 8 deaths have been reported; the samples were sent to the Centers for the Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, confirming that all were caused by diphtheria.

The 1st findings of the notifications of the disease showed that all had incomplete vaccination schedules.

The Dominican Republic has the Expanded Immunization Program (EPI), with all its components and 1400 fixed vaccination posts distributed throughout the country, with immunizations available and free. To avoid preventable diseases, the Ministry of Health, through the Epidemiology Directorate, urges the population to go to the vaccination centers to follow up on the official vaccination scheme.

The Ministry of Public Health reported that 3 cases were female, and 7 were male between the ages of 2 to 14 years, with an average of 6 years old. The places [provinces] from where they were notified are: Peravia, [city of] Bani, (1); Bahoruco, [city of] Neyba, (1); [San Cristobal] Boruga neighborhood in [city of] San Cristobal, (2); [Monte Plata] Yamasa de Monte Plata, (4); [Santo Domingo,] [city of] Area VII Los Alcarrizos, (1) and [Santo Domingo] in [city of] Santo Domingo Norte, (1).

Among the control actions developed by the Ministry of Public Health to prevent new infections is chemoprophylaxis of close contacts and active search for susceptibles for administration of diphtheria vaccine (DT and DPT, as appropriate).

The Ministry of Public Health urges the following measures:
- The general population is requested to be up to date with the vaccination schedule in children and adults;
- For health personnel, detect and treat diphtheria cases in a timely manner, according to the protocol established by the health authorities;
- It also instructs the timely notification of cases to the National Epidemiological Surveillance System (SINAVE); and
- Administer diphtheria antitoxin on time.

The Provincial and Health Areas Directorates are carrying out additional vaccination days to increase vaccination coverage (house-to-house sweeps, follow-up of children with incomplete schedules). It urges its agencies to identify areas at risk for migrants to complete the scheme and to vaccinate other high-risk groups (health workers, migrants, adolescents between 9-15 years old).

The health agency highlights that, as in other countries, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected vaccination and other essential health services, observing a decrease in demand from the population.

In the Dominican Republic in 2020, 3 confirmed cases of diphtheria were notified to the National Epidemiological Surveillance System (SINAVE), of which no epidemiological link was documented. The 1st case was reported in epidemiological week (EW) 7 [week of 15 Feb 2021], in a 9-year-old girl, resident in the San Juan municipality, and with a history of 2 doses of vaccine. The other 2 cases are from Capotillo, National District: one in week 7, a 17-year-old male who died, and another case in week 40, a 14-year-old female, alive, both with no vaccination history.

Diphtheria is an acute bacterial disease, which mainly affects the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract (nose, tonsils, pharynx, larynx) and the skin. Asymptomatic infection is the most common result. The characteristic lesion is caused by a reaction to the potent exotoxin, which produces an adherent asymmetric grayish-white membrane surrounded by inflammation. Its signs and symptoms, which usually appear 2-5 days after exposure, can range from mild to severe.

The Dominican Republic, with a population of about 3.3 million residents, is a country located on the eastern 5/8ths of the island of Hispaniola, which it shares with Haiti, in the Greater Antilles archipelago of the Caribbean region (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Republic). The Dominican Republic is the 2nd-largest nation in the Antilles by area (after Cuba). The Dominican Republic is divided into 31 provinces, while the national capital, Santo Domingo, is contained within its own National District; a map of the provinces can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_the_Dominican_Republic.

The Dominican Republic reported to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) 3 cases, including 2 deaths, in 2020 (https://iris.paho.org/handle/10665.2/53380). However, the Dominican Republic reported 0 cases in 2018 and 2019 (https://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&view=download&category_slug=diphtheria-8968&alias=51187-6-december-2019-diphtheria-epidemiological-update-1&Itemid=270&lang=en), and only one confirmed case in 2017 (http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&Itemid=270&gid=43201).

PAHO attributed "various factors" contributing to the occurrence of diphtheria outbreaks in the Region of the Americas in 2020, including non-compliance with vaccination coverage during the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to the postponement of vaccination campaigns (https://iris.paho.org/handle/10665.2/53173).

Diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable infection caused by toxin-producing strains of _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, an aerobic Gram-positive bacillus. Toxin production occurs only when the bacillus is infected by a specific bacteriophage that carries the gene encoding the toxin. The toxin is responsible for the major complications, myocarditis (such as cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure) and neuritis (such as paralysis of the soft palate, eye muscles, limbs, and diaphragm). _C. ulcerans_ and _C. pseudotuberculosis_ can also harbor diphtheria toxin genes and cause zoonotic infection in humans.

Humans are the only reservoir of _C. diphtheriae_. Transmission of _C. diphtheriae_ can occur through respiratory droplets, direct contact with cutaneous infections, and articles soiled with discharges from the respiratory tract or skin lesions. Organisms can be shed for up to 4 weeks without antibiotics, but chronic carriers may shed organisms for 6 months or more. Effective antibiotic therapy promptly terminates shedding. The organisms can survive in dust and clothing for up to 6 months (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/dip.pdf). Shedding from cutaneous lesions can cause respiratory and cutaneous infections in contacts.

Diphtheria toxoid vaccine is available combined with tetanus toxoid, both in full-strength doses (denoted by upper case letters "DT") in pediatric formulations and in reduced-strength doses combined with a full-strength dose of tetanus toxoid (denoted by upper case T and lowercase d, "Td") in adult formulations. These are combined with acellular or whole-cell pertussis antigens in full strength pediatric formulations (DTaP, DTwP) or in reduced strength in the adolescent/adult-formulations (Tdap). In the United States, a total of 5 DTaP doses are recommended to be given to children: one dose each at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, with booster doses at ages 15-18 months, and 4-6 years (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/schedules/child-schedule.htm).

Respiratory diphtheria is treated with diphtheria antitoxin and antibiotic. Td vaccination is recommended for the patient's close contacts (that is, those who may have been exposed to respiratory secretions or who are close household contacts) if Td has not been administered within the last 5 years. These contacts should have nasal and pharyngeal specimens obtained for culture and should also be given antibiotic prophylaxis. - Mod.ML
