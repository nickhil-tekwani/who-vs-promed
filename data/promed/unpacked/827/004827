Vesicular disease suspected in Paraguay
-------------------------------------
According to the ABC Color Journal News, and the newspaper Campo
Grande News, suspicions of a vesicular disease in cattle have been
reported in Paraguay.
The reports come from small farm holders, from several places in San
Pedro Department, describing diseased animals with salivation and
lesions on gingival mucosa and hooves.
Senacsa [Servicio Nacional de Salud Animal (National Animal Health
Service, Paraguay)] has sent epidemiologists to the area to verify
the reports, and, to take samples from affected animals. Cattle of
several small farmers seem to be affected, and the lesions look like
those of FMD and IBR [infectious bovine rhinotracheitis]. The results
of lab tests are expected next week [3rd week of September 2004].
A similar report appeared in the news some weeks ago. The affected
cattle were located close to the border with Brazil. It was
considered an IBR outbreak. Nevertheless, IAGRO [Animal Health Agency
of Mato Grosso do Sul State] decided, among others measures, to
vaccinate all cattle located close to the border with Paraguay
against FMD.

[Dr. Rivera is kindly thanked for this important information.
During August 2004, IBR was suspected in Brazil in a region adjacent
to Paraguay. Interestingly, the Brazilian authorities decided to
carry out mass vaccinations in the area against FMD. Reportedly, they
decided also to form a common frontier commission with Paraguay to
monitor animal health. [see 20040905.2479].
Information on the findings of the said frontier commission, and any
additional 1st-hand information on the allegedly suspected FMD in
Paraguay, will be appreciated. - Mod.AS].
