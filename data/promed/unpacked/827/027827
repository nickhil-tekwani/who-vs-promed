Frozen Beef Burgers May Contain Dangerous Bacteria
------------------------------------------------------
Federated Co-op Limited, Saskatoon is warning consumers not to
consume Country Morning and CO-OP Gold Brand frozen Beef Burgers,
because these products may contain _E. coli_ O157:H7 bacteria.
The following suspected frozen ground beef burgers were produced on
14 Jun 2002:
Country Morning Frozen Beef Burgers, only in the 2.27 Kg. Box (20
patties at 13 grams each) with the code dates 11652, 21652, 31652,
41652, 51652, 61652, 71652,81652, and UPC 0 57316 08662 4
CO-OP Gold Frozen A Sizzler Onion and Pepper Beef Burger, 907 g, 8
patties at 113 g, with the code date 81652 and UPC 0 57316 11557 7
Federated Co-op Limited, is voluntarily recalling these products
which were distributed through CO-OP stores in Alberta, Saskatchewan,
Manitoba and Thunder Bay only.
Consumers are urged to return the recalled products to the stores
from which they were purchased for full credit. These are the only
burgers affected by this recall. The code date appears on the end
panel of each box.
There have been 2 cases of reported illness, which may be linked to
the improper cooking of this product. _E. coli_ O157:H7 may cause
life-threatening illness by producing a toxin that breaks down the
lining of the
intestines and damages the kidneys. Food contaminated with the _E.
coli_ bacteria will not look or smell spoiled. This product should
not be consumed. For food safety, Health Canada recommends that all
ground beef products should be properly handled and cooked to an
internal temperature of 160 degrees F. (70 degrees C).

Administrator of Prince Edward Island hospital says _E. coli_ hasn't spread
---------------------------
CHARLOTTETOWN (CP) -- The administrator of a PEI hospital where
several people are suspected to have contracted a deadly strain of
_E. coli_ says there haven't been further signs of the illness.
Cecil Ballard said that since 29 Oct, 2002, a total of 14 patients
and 31 staff at Hillsborough hospital have experienced symptoms of
_E. coli_ at the hospital. The official said there has been no
further cases since Wednesday, 6 Oct.
2 patients died this week, but so far there is no relation between
those deaths and _E. coli_. 2 staff have been confirmed positive for
_E. coli_. One is in hospital while the other is resting at home.
Officials said the results from cultures taken from the victims will
not be back until sometime Saturday. Meantime, staff who showed
symptoms will not be allowed back to work until all tests come back
negative.
