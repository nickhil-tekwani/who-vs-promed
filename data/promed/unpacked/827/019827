Warning follows illness of 2 Marin infants
---------------------------------------------
Marin County health officials are warning the pregnant and infirm to
avoid certain food choices, after 2 infants were sickened during
February 2004 with the bacterium _Listeria_. The babies, born on 14
and 16 Feb 2004, became ill with listeriosis shortly after birth,
triggering an investigation into potential sources for the bacteria,
said Deputy Public Health Officer Dr. Nathalie Bera. Both babies have
made a full recovery, she said.
County health officials and the state Department of Food and
Agriculture recently investigated an unidentified local market after
the mothers reported eating cheese, but a batch of soft cheese sent
to a state lab came back negative for _Listeria_. A vendor peddling
cheese from a cart in San Rafael's Canal neighborhood also fell under
suspicion, but without a sample of the cheese or access to the
vendor, a conclusive connection is difficult, health officials said.
"Where we're at right now is the state is interested in looking into
the vendor angle," said Dave Smail of the county's Environmental
Health Services division. "It's not uncommon for the state to
investigate allegations of street vending of cheese. The state is
intending to do that."
Listeria grows in soil and water and is often carried by animals.
Common food-borne culprits include meat, unpasteurized products such
as soft cheeses, and raw vegetables. The bacteria is killed when food
is cooked, but not when it is refrigerated, county health officials
said. The bacteria can cause gastrointestinal problems, fever and
flu-like symptoms, and is most dangerous for pregnant women, people
who have compromised immune systems, and small children.
County health officials have asked San Rafael police to keep a
vigilant eye on food carts, which have been the source of such
infections in the state in the past. "We're looking for any peddlers,
in particular in the Canal neighborhood," said San Rafael police Sgt.
Jonathan Bean. "Aside from a public health threat, it's a violation
for the vendors to operate without a city business license, a police
vendor permit, and the county environmental health service permit."
City spokeswoman Lydia Romero said officers will strictly enforce the
city's vendor ordinance. Only 6 or 7 such business licenses to
operate have been issued to date, she said. On average, 0 to 2 cases
per year of illness from Listeria are reported in Marin, county
health officials said.
County health authorities have alerted health care providers in the
county, urging them to advise pregnant women and people with
compromised immune systems to avoid foods that could spread the
bacteria. If they do eat such foods, common-sense food practices,
such as washing raw vegetables carefully and fully cooking meats, are
advised.

[The temporal association between the 2 neonatal infections suggests
a common source, although comparison of the 2 isolates is required.
Soft cheeses and meat cold cuts, 2 of the more common vehicles for
_L. monocytogenes_, should be avoided in high-risk groups, including
pregnant women, whether or not there are known cases. Many of the
pregnancy-related cases result in miscarriages. - Mod.LL]
