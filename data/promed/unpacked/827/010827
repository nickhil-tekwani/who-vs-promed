[I have checked the OIE records, and the latest recorded anthrax outbreaks were in 1997 and 1998; see 28 Jan 2006 Anthrax, human, livestock - Italy: background 20060128.0275. And this current outbreak, according to the OIE report, is in Italy's "toe," far from Basilicata with its sporadic outbreaks.

This outbreak started in the last week of May 2020 and was promptly confirmed by the national anthrax laboratory in Foggia on 1 Jun 2020. This was presumably followed by an investigation and a report submitted to Rome on 7 Jul 2020, which was then promptly reported to OIE in Paris. It is hoped there is more information than Rome is willing to share, although Calabria seems to be unaware of the availability of a very adequate Italian anthrax vaccine. And why was the case slaughtered? There is no need to slaughter an animal surviving anthrax if the pathogen had not killed it. Clarification is awaited from our Italian colleagues. - Mod.MHJ
