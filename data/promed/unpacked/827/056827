Papua health agency has sent a 4-strong team to Intan Jaya regency to
verify reports of malaria outbreak which is said to have killed 40
people in the highland region over the last 3 months.

Team member Paminto Widodo of the Papua Health Crisis Center said
Wednesday [9 Jun 2010] the medical workers would focus their mission
on Degesiga and Bamba villages, where the disease reportedly affected
the most. "We will examine whether the people died of malaria or other
diseases.

Malaria usually does not spread in regions located at a high altitude
with a cool temperature," Paminto said, adding that the team would
check if the people who were killed by the disease had never left the
regency.

The regional health agency has conducted fogging to prevent the
disease from spreading across the regency.

Papua legislative council member Julius Miagoni, who reported the
outbreak to the health authorities, said the fatalities resulting from
malaria were first detected in April [2010].

[Intan Jaya regency is located in Papua (formerly Irian Jaya)
province, the Indonesian western half of the island of New Guinea. The
article mentions that the 2 villages are located at an altitude which
usually excludes malaria transmission. ProMED-mail has not be able to
precisely locate the place of the outbreak. The malaria diagnosis is
not confirmed, but if it is malaria the most obvious explanation would
be that the infected persons visited areas with transmission and got
infected. ProMED-mail will be happy to post further information. -
