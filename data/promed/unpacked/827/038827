China to donate vaccine to Mongolia to combat foot and mouth disease
--------------------------------------------------------------------
China would donate 100 000 doses of vaccine to Mongolia to help fight foot
and mouth disease [FMD] in the country's east, the Mongolian government
said on Tuesday [12 Oct 2010]. Enkhbbold Miegombo, deputy prime minister
and head of the national emergency commission, said current efforts to
fight the disease were not satisfactory.

Until 1 Oct 2010, 10 counties in Dornod and Sukhbaatar provinces had
suffered outbreaks of the disease, but the count had risen to 16 on Monday
[11 Oct 2010], Mongolian officials said. The deputy prime minister said
some officials in the provinces would be held accountable for incompetence
in fighting the disease. The officials in the firing line included governor
of Sukhbaatar province, whose future would be discussed at a cabinet meeting.

Currently, 20 550 out of 31 400 livestock animals in 16 counties were
infected with FMD and 20 346 had been culled, said Orgil, chairman of
Mongolia's veterinary service and livestock breeding agency. About 2.4
million livestock animals have been vaccinated in the eastern provinces of
Mongolia.

The agency appealed to other countries and international organizations for
help and asked for FMD vaccine and other necessary products. Some countries
and international organizations have pledged to help Mongolia combat the
contagious livestock disease.

Orgil said Russia was ready to sell 600 000 doses of vaccine at an
appropriate price.

[From the above report it is not clear if the vaccine applied in Mongolia
hitherto did not provide sufficient protection, or if its available
quantities fell short of the needs for the completion of mass vaccination,
or if the performance of vaccination procedures underwent
difficulties/deficiencies; details would be helpful.

Mongolia reported on 5 May 2010 an outbreak of FMD, serotype O, which had,
reportedly, started on 21 Apr 2010. This epizootic, reportedly involving 3
foci in the east (a "defined zone within the country"), was declared as
"resolved" on 11 Aug 2010; for the reports and map, see
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9210>. On
1 Sep 2010, Mongolia reported a reoccurrence of the same serotype strain in
the east; so far, 2 new outbreaks have been reported to the OIE, the last
one on 11 Sep 2010. See the reports and a map at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9653>. A
new follow-up report is expected.

The virus responsible for the 1st 2010 epizootic in Mongolia has been
identified by ARRIAH (the All-Russian FMD reference laboratory in
Vladimir), in collaboration with WRLFMD (Pirbright, UK), as FMDV serotype
O, SEA topotype, Mya-98 lineage, which is similar to the FMDV identified
during 2010 in China (Hong Kong SAR), South Korea, Japan, and Russian
territories adjacent to China and Mongolia.

It may be assumed that the Chinese vaccine, donated to Mongolia, should
have been expected to render the desired protection against the said virus;
it will be interesting to note which vaccine strain is used by the Chinese
producer and if this vaccine has been applied in China (most probably in
dairy cattle) against the said virus strain with satisfactory protection
obtained. - Mod.AS]
