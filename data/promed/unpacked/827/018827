Viet Nam: Increased Surveillance for Suspected Avian Influenza Virus Cases
--------------------------------------------------
Epidemiologists and doctors will begin supervising suspected avian
influenza patients across the country starting on Sat 29 Jan 2005 as part
of efforts to fight the disease. Avian influenza has killed 9 out of the 10
infected patients in Viet Nam since late 2004.
Director of the Central Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology Dr Nguyen
Tran Hien said at a meeting on Wed 26 Jan 2005 that the supervision
programme will take and test phlegm samples from all patients who show
symptoms of respiratory disease. The tests will help provide timely
treatment for patients infected with avian influenza as well as help with
epidemiological investigations and vaccine production, Hien said. The
supervision effort will be conducted by the World Health Organisation, the
Central Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology and the Pasteur Institutes
from the central, southern and Tay Nguyen (Central Highlands) areas.
WHO representatives said that Tamiflu therapy is ineffective for patients
who are not infected [already] with the H5N1 influenza virus and less
effective for patients who have already been infected for 48 hours.
The Health Ministry has proposed that international organisations support
Viet Nam in building safe laboratories for medical research institutes to
prevent lab technicians from contracting infectious diseases. Deputy
Director of the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City, Tran
Tinh Hien, urged the establishment of a fund to help [support] poor avian
influenza patients. He explained that most patients are from poor rural
provinces and that treatment costs in urban areas are very high. Each
patient requires about VND 900 000 [USD 57] per day worth of tests,
respirators and antibiotics, Hien said. The hospital had paid VND 30
million [USD 1900] to one patient from Tay Ninh Province. Since the
beginning of 2005, the outbreak has spread to 27 provinces and cities and
killed nearly 700 000 poultry, reported the Animal Health Department.
The department on Wed 26 Jul 2005 issued directives for safe slaughtering
of poultry and for buying and selling the birds. Only healthy poultry are
allowed to be slaughtered. Customers should be careful to buy fresh
poultry that have been quarantined. The department also bans the slaughter
or trade of birds and fresh poultry meat at temporary markets. Birds must
be sold in hygienic and sterilised areas. The transport of poultry is only
allowed with quarantine certificates, and poultry meat must be posted with
hygiene stamps before being consumed.

Viet Nam: 5 more Suspected Cases of Avian Influenza
--------------------------------------------------
Avian influenza [virus] has infected 5 more people in Viet Nam, 2 of whom
are under treatment in Ho Chi Minh City where riot police are manning
checkpoints for poultry vehicles and authorities have issued warnings to
travel agents.
A researcher at the city's Pasteur Institute told Reuters on Fri 28 Jan
2005 that tests had confirmed the poultry virus had infected 2 girls, a
10-year-old from Long An province and a 13-year-old from Dong Thap
province. "We tested the 13-year-old girl 3 times and found the H5
component in her samples," said the laboratory researcher, referring to the
H5N1 poultry virus. Her mother died on 21 Jan 2005, also from the H5N1
virus, doctors said.
Tests on 3 men aged between 30 and 66 who are now being treated at a Hanoi
hospital, also confirmed they were infected with the poultry virus, the
Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper said, citing lab tests.
The 5 new cases bring Vietnam's total number of human infections to 16 in
the latest wave of the virus which first surfaced there in December 2003.
Of these cases, 9 have died in recent weeks. Including the 12 people who
died of bird flu in Thailand during 2004, Asia's total death toll now
stands at 41.
Officials in Ho Chi Minh City, a sprawling metropolis of 10 million people,
said riot police would now be joining market inspectors at poultry van
checkpoints set up around the city to stop the virus spreading. The city's
tourism department has also asked tour agents to stop taking visitors to
areas where the risk of poultry virus infection is high, the Saigon Giai
Phong daily said.
Most of the victims are believed to have caught the virus from infected
poultry, but doctors fear it could mutate into one that is easily passed
between people, unleashing a global human flu pandemic that could kill
millions.
[2 of these cases, the 10-year-old and 13-year-old girls, have already been
reported in previous reports from Viet Nam - see: Avian influenza, human -
East Asia (21): Viet Nam 20050127.0297. Therefore this above report (and
the 2 reports below) identify 3 (rather than 5) new cases (one of whom has
died). - Mod.CP]

Viet Nam: 3 More Avian Influenza Cases Reported
-------------------------------------------------
Viet Nam has just found 3 more people in the country's northern region to
have contracted avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection, raising the total
in the country to 16 since late December 2004.
Initial tests by the National Hygiene and Epidemiology Institute show that
samples from a 66-year-old from Hanoi city, a 30-year-old from Hung Yen
province, and a 30-year-old from Phu Tho province were positive for the
virus, the local newspaper Labor reported on Fri 28 Jan 2005.
The patients, who are receiving treatment at the Hanoi-based Tropical
Disease Institute, are all in stable condition. The 30-year-olds, who were
hospitalized on 22 Jan 2005 and 23 Jan 2005, respectively, had contact with
sick fowl. The reason for [infection] of the 66-year-old, who was admitted
to hospital on 25 Jan 2005, is under investigation.
2 local people, a 15-year-old teenager from southern Kien Giang province
and a 24-year-old woman from central Binh Dinh province, have just been
admitted to provincial hospitals after showing symptoms of high
temperature, cough, and damaged lungs. The patients are suspected to have
contracted H5N1, since they either ate chicken or traded poultry.
Among the 16 cases of avian influenza infection nationwide, 9, including 8
from the southern region and one from the northern region, have died.
However, the Ministry of Health has so far confirmed [only] 10 out of the
16 cases. The 1st case in the northern region, a 42-year-old man in Hanoi,
is set to be discharged from the Tropical Disease Institute on Fri 28 Jan 2005.
Avian influenza has stricken 27 cities and provinces nationwide, killing
and leading to the forced culling of more than 812 000 fowl, according to
the Department of Animal Health.

Viet Nam; 3 New Cases (One of whom has Died) Reported
-------------------------------------------------
Viet Nam reported another avian flu death on Fri 28 Jan 2005, bringing the
human toll to 10 over the last month, officials said. A 32-year-old man
from northern Phu Tho province [presumably the same patient referred to as
a 30-year-old above - Mod.CP] died on Thu 27 Jan 2005 after spending 5 days
in Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi, a doctor said on condition of anonymity. 2
other men, aged 66 and 30, from Hanoi and Hung Yen province, respectively,
tested positive for the H5N1 serotype of avian influenza virus and remained
in stable condition on Fri 28 Jan 2005, he said.
The man who died developed a high fever, coughing, and breathing
difficulties on 12 Jan 2005, said Nguyen Dinh Trong, Director of Phu Tho
Provincial Preventive Medicine Centre. The man's family raised poultry but
none of them has shown signs of illness, Trong said, adding there were no
avian influenza outbreaks reported among poultry in his village. Trong,
however, said the man was involved in the trade of poultry from infected
areas 6 months ago but had stopped since then, he added.

Viet Nam: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 7
----------------------------------------------
As of Fri 28 Jan 2005, WHO has received reports that laboratory tests
undertaken in Vietnam have confirmed 2 further cases of human infection
with avian influenza A (H5N1) A virus. WHO is seeking confirmation from the
Ministry of Health.
The 1st newly detected case is a 10-year-old girl from the southern
province of Long An. She developed symptoms on 13 Jan 2003, was
hospitalized on 20 Jan 2005, and is presently in critical condition. The
2nd case is a 13-year-old girl from Dong Thap Province, also in the south.
She developed symptoms on 20 Jan 2005 and was hospitalized on 22 Jan 2005.
She is also critically ill.
The child from Dong Thap Province is the daughter of a confirmed case
announced previously. Her 35-year-old mother developed symptoms on 14 Jan
2005 and died on 21 Jan 2005.
WHO understands that Vietnamese authorities are launching investigations
into this newly detected family cluster. The investigation will explore
possible sources of exposure and look for signs of illness in family
members, other close contacts, and the general community. In view of the
6-day interval between dates of symptom onset in the mother and her child,
limited human-to-human transmission, as seen during similar events in the
past, cannot be ruled out at this stage. All such clusters of cases,
closely related in place and time, require urgent investigation to
determine whether the epidemiological behaviour of the virus might be
changing to favour the onset of a pandemic.
If confirmed by the Ministry of Health, these latest 2 cases will bring the
total in Viet Nam reported since mid-December 2004 to 12. To date, 9 of
these cases have been fatal.
WHO is again emphasizing the need for family members caring for H5N1
patients to follow recommended protective measures. Since human cases of
H5N1 were first reported in January 2004, no cases have been reported in
health care workers or in professionals undertaking culling activities.
Their continued adherence to recommended protective measures is equally
important.

[Taken together, these reports indicate that since 28 Jan 2004 there have
been 39 confirmed cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection and 29
deaths in Viet Nam, plus 3 new cases still to be confirmed by WHO, one of
whom is reported to have died. A 2nd family cluster is being assessed. -
