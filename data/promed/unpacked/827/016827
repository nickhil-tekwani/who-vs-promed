Thirty people or more have reported contracting parasitic infections after a charity banquet at a restaurant in Jacksonville, FL.

A local television news outlet is reporting that people who were at an Exchange Club banquet at Cooper's Hawk Winery & Restaurant developed gastrointestinal illnesses with some having been confirmed infected by the _Cyclospora_ parasite.

"I got up to go to the bathroom and collapsed," TC, who attended the banquet, told News4Jax. "My wife called 911 and I was taken to the hospital by ambulance. TC also said he lost 12 pounds since becoming ill in mid-June.

It can take 2 days to 2 weeks after ingesting _Cyclospora_ for symptoms of the infection known as cyclosporiasis to develop, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Once a person becomes ill, it can take 2 or more weeks for initial and confirmation laboratory test results to be logged by outbreak investigators. _Cyclospora_ outbreaks are frequently linked to fresh produce such as cilantro.

Officials from the Duval County Health Department are working with the CDC on the outbreak investigation. Officials are requesting banquet attendees to fill out surveys.

Even though it's been almost a month since TC became ill, according to the television station report, he is still sick. Another outbreak victim, JJ, also said symptoms from the parasitic infection keep hanging on. "What has been so devastating about this is that there are relapses. So you think you're getting better, you feel, like 'OK. I'm alright. I'm going to eat a small meal or a piece of toast.' And maybe a day or two goes by and bam, here it comes again."

According to the CDC, symptoms of cyclosporiasis may include the following:
Watery diarrhea, which is the most common symptom; loss of appetite; weight loss; cramping; bloating; increased gas; nausea; and fatigue. Other symptoms that may occur but are less common include vomiting and a low-grade fever.

If a person becomes infected with the _Cyclospora_ parasite and is not treated, symptoms can persist for several weeks.

[Cyclosporiasis is caused by a single cell, protozoan parasite _Cyclospora cayetanensis_ (https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/cyclosporiasis/index.html). It is well known that it is spread with different lettuce products and has previously caused multi-state outbreaks in the US when products from a single manufacturer have been widely distributed.

Another branch of this same restaurant chain in Florida (Palm Beach Gardens) has just recently had 2 employees with Hepatitis A:
