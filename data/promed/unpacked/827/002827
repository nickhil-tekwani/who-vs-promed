A case of Ebola has been diagnosed in Guinea, a health agency spokesman said on Fri 2 Apr 2021, resetting a count that had begun last week to declaring the country free of the virus.

The case was detected on Thu 1 Apr 2021 in the southeastern town of Soulouta, less than 20 km (12 miles) from where the current outbreak began in February 2021. "It is still unclear if this is a contact case. Investigations are ongoing," the spokesman said.

A total of 15 people have tested positive for Ebola in the West African nation, and 9 have died since the outbreak began. It marked the 1st resurgence of the virus in Guinea since the disease's deadliest epidemic, which killed more than 11 000 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone between 2013 and 2016.

An Ebola outbreak is typically declared over once 42 days have passed following a 2nd negative test of blood samples from the last confirmed case.

Guinea began a vaccination campaign to contain the spread of the virus, which causes severe bleeding and organ failure and is spread through contact with body fluids, at the end of February 2021.

"Saddened to hear of the Ebola case reported in Guinea. We remain on high alert -- supporting Guinean health authorities' surveillance efforts and preparedness in neighbouring areas," Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization's regional head for Africa, said on Twitter.

The WHO said in March 2021 that the February 2021 resurgence is likely to have been sparked by a latent infection in the human population from the last Ebola outbreak rather than from the virus jumping the species barrier again.

[2] Guinea: new case

Medics in Guinea tracked down suspected carriers of the Ebola virus after they fled a southeastern town where the country's 1st case in nearly a month was detected, a health agency spokesman said on Fri 2 Apr 2021, resetting a count that had begun last week to declaring the country free of the virus.

The West African country's World Health Organization (WHO) representative, Georges Alfred Ki-Zerbo said the case followed a cluster of suspicious deaths in Soulouta.

"This illustrates the need for enhanced monitoring in the local region, also in other regions, to contain this new cluster as soon as possible," he said.

After the case was diagnosed, some residents initially barricaded roads into the town, denying access to response teams who were now searching for other suspected Ebola cases who had fled.

[The suspicious cases that were mentioned to have occurred prior to the fatal case serve as a red flag that, likely, there are more cases than this single one detected. Unfortunately, the identified contacts have fled the area, making contact tracing extremely difficult. Ring vaccination is the most effective way to try to capture even those who leave the immediate area, but sufficient resources are needed to accomplish it.

[3] Vaccine shortage

To date [5 Mar 2021], 18 Ebola cases have been reported in the West African nation [Guinea] (14 confirmed and 4 deaths) [15 confirmed and 9 deaths as of 3 Apr 2021. - Mod LK]; only 30 000 Ebola vaccines are available, out of a global stock of half a million.

"We are using the ring vaccination," said Dr Ibrahima Soce Fall, the Assistant Director-General of WHO responsible for emergency response, referring to the strategy that inhibits the spread of a disease by vaccinating only those most likely to be infected.

"We are vaccinating the contacts of cases, the contact of contacts, and their contacts. With this strategy we are able to control this type of outbreak. But we are going to need more vaccines," Dr Fall told journalists in Geneva on Fri 2 Apr 2021.

"If the outbreak spreads to other countries, we have limited stocks" said the Director of Strategic Health Operations at WHO, Dr. Michel Yao. He was speaking by videoconference from the town of Nzerekore in Guinea, one of the epicentres of the outbreak, which is near the border with Liberia and Cote d'Ivoire.

The last Ebola outbreak in Guinea, which started in 2014, quickly spread to neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone. By the time it was finally brought under control, it had become the deadliest Ebola outbreak since the virus was 1st detected in 1976, with some 28 000 cases and 11 000 deaths.

"There are 6 neighbouring countries to Guinea, and we conducted a self-assessment of readiness," said Gueye Abdou Salam, Regional Emergency Director of WHO's regional office for Africa, speaking from Brazzaville. "Two of the countries are not ready, and one country is on the borderline, and there are 3 countries that are more or less ready."

Having faced previous Ebola outbreaks has given health authorities a considerable advantage this time around, the experts agreed.

"It is important to learn the lessons from these outbreaks," said Dr. Georges Alfred Ki-Zerbo, the WHO Representative in Guinea, who highlighted the need to secure the trust of local communities in all the areas where vaccination campaigns were planned.

"Where we launch the vaccination campaign in Gouecke, a few km from there is the village of Wome. This is where a team of officials and responders were trapped and actually killed in the last outbreak in 2015. So, we need to take that into account when we engage with communities to make sure that we listen to them," Dr. Ki-Zerbo said.

There is broad consensus among health officials that acting quickly is a crucial factor in controlling the spread of Ebola but that preventive measures and better preparedness are also needed to protect people from a broader range of pathogens.

Dr Fall maintained that the world will face an increasing number of health epidemics, especially as human habitats encroach on forest areas.

"We are increasingly in a situation in which we have to face multiple epidemics," he said. "Countries must be enabled to respond to multiple epidemics, but especially through preventive measures."

One current challenge is that the strong focus on the COVID-19 pandemic is making it more difficult to focus global attention on the tools needed to respond to any other emerging pathogens.
