One hundred & eighty nine residents of Kachkanar, in Russia's Sverdlovsk
Region in the Urals, 90% of whom are children, have contracted an
infectious pneumonia whose origin is unknown to doctors.
The outbreak began in a number of town schools in late September [2001],
sources in the sanitary and epidemiological department of the Sverdlovsk
Region told Interfax. The disease's origin is still unknown, but it is
curable.
Epidemiologists fear that some of the infected have not been reported.
Early phases of the disease look like an average upper respiratory
infection, and patients come to see the doctor only after the symptoms
develop into a grave case of pneumonia.
Measures against epidemics are being taken in Kachkanar schools.
Bactericidal lamps are being installed, and additional instructions are
being given to school doctors.
