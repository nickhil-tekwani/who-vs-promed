I wanted to take the opportunity to comment on these recent postings because it highlights an important epidemiologic nuance about the rabies virus variants that circulate in the United States. While the greatest global burden of rabies is due to the canine strain of the virus, in the United States, the virus variant(s) that you have to deal with depends upon where you live. While it is certainly true that Pennsylvania (as well as the mid-Atlantic and New England states and some of the southeastern states) experiences a great deal of rabies in skunks, they do not have "skunk rabies"; they do not have the virus variant that is maintained in skunks as the reservoir/host species. A map of the virus variants in the United States is available here http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/resources/publications/2012-surveillance/reservoirs.html.

The distinction about virus variants is an important one for professionals that deal with rabies prevention and control because the epidemiology of the different variants is unique to that variant. I think this can actually be best seen visually using the maps that CDC produces annually and that can be viewed here http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/resources/publications/index.html under the 2012 Rabies Surveillance Maps/figures (note: the maps show very similar patterns year-to-year). What is most significant, in my opinion, is that states on the East Coast that have the raccoon variant of the virus, experience significantly more spillover of virus from raccoons into other species (including skunks, dogs, cats and foxes) than any of the other terrestrial virus variants seen in the US. This is likely due to a combination of factors such as raccoon (and skunk) population densities, raccoon natural history and behavior, human populations and perhaps the virus variant itself. Understanding the local epidemiology of your rabies virus variant is critical to evidence-based prevention and control.

Back ages ago I was a volunteer keeping the Morris Animal Foundation and some domestic ferret organizations updated on rabies policy changes in each state and territory (since all differ) and how they compared to the recommendations of the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians: http://www.nasphv.org/Documents/RabiesCompendium.pdf.

(After the CDC finished its work to see how much strains of rabies might differ in a single species) I was in regular communication with numerous State Public Health vets (a friendly and knowledgeable bunch overall) and with some rabies experts at the CDC, including the wonderful Dr. Charles Rupprecht. Back then someone, perhaps CR, perhaps Dr. Faye Sorhage, or maybe someone else, told me that a key to an animal being a wild animal vector for rabies is the ability to survive and function unusually long with the infection. Bats, skunks, and foxes certainly are well documented for doing so, but in New Jersey I was, at that time, surprised to find that the very large local groundhogs also had met the criteria for wild rabies vectors.

The State Public Health vets very often do a grand job of having useful state websites, too, by the way.

Physicians who enjoy good resources will appreciate http://www.nasphv.org/Documents/RabiesCompendium.pdf and some of their other compendia.
