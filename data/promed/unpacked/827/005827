Farmers are worried about a mystery disease spreading in chickpea
crops in the Wimmera-Mallee [mallee is a low rainfall area with small
trees and shrub vegetation - Mod.DHA].

The Department of Primary Industries [DPI Victoria] says there are
several possible causes, such as a mixture of root disease, viruses
and seasonal conditions, but there are no results yet from testing.

A farmer from Litchfield says most of his 80 hectare crop is
affected. "Going from yellow to brown, up to 50 percent more are dead
now," he said.

[A number of fungal and viral disease problems are known to affect
chickpeas in Australia. For example, in September 2009 South
Australian chickpea growers were alerted to monitor their crops for
ascochyta blight and botrytis grey mould (for media release and
disease fact sheets see links below). Ongoing breeding programmes are
set up to counteract emerging new pathogen strains. Since the problem
reported above appears to be complex and is suspected to be due to
more than one factor, reliable diagnosis is essential to design
effective control strategies.
