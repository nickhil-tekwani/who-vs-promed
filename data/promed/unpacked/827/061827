99/183 EPPO report on selected intercepted consignments
-------------------------------------------------------
The EPPO Secretariat has gathered the intercepted consignment reports for
1999 received since the previous report (EPPO RS 99/164) from the following
countries: Austria, Belgium, Czechia [Czech republic?, Estonia, France,
Finland, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal Spain,
Switzerland, United Kingdom. When a consignment has been re-exported and
the country of origin is unknown, the re-exporting country is indicated in
brackets. When the occurrence of a pest in a given country is not known to
the EPPO Secretariat, this is indicated by an asterisk (*).
The EPPO Secretariat has selected interceptions made because of the
presence of pests. Other interceptions due to prohibited commodities,
missing or invalid certificates are not indicated. It must be pointed out
that the report is only partial, as many EPPO countries have not yet sent
their interception reports.
Note: In EPPO RS 99/112, several consignments of maize from Hungary were
intercepted by Austria because of the presence of _Pantoea stewartii_ pv.
_stewartii_. The Hungarian authorities have informed the EPPO Secretariat
that this bacterium has never been observed in Hungary. In addition, maize
fields corresponding to the lots in question were found free from this
pathogen during inspections made in 1998. Seed samples were collected and
tested in
the laboratory and were all free from it.
Pest/Consignment/Type of commodity/Country of origin/Country of
