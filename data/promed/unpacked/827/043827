Ontario issues alert about four cases of atypical pneumonia
-----------------------
TORONTO, March 14 /CNW/ - Dr. Karim Kurji, on behalf of Ontario's Chief
Medical Officer of Health Dr. Colin D'Cunha, today took steps to alert
physicians, hospitals, ambulance services and public health units across
the province that there are four cases of atypical pneumonia in Toronto
that have resulted in 2 deaths.
The Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care's Public Health Division and the
Toronto Public Health Unit are working closely with 4 Toronto area
hospitals to investigate these 4 cases of atypical pneumonia which have
occurred within one family.
Public health officials are working as quickly as possible to determine the
cause of these cases.
"The public health system is following standard procedure to notify the
public about the outbreak of a potential communicable disease," Dr. Kurji
said. "We are confident that the hospitals are following all the necessary
infectious control procedures to contain and monitor the illness."
The 3 hospitals where the family members have received treatment are The
Scarborough Hospital (Grace Division), Sunnybrook and Women's
College Health Sciences Centre and Mount Sinai Hospital. One child is
currently under observation at the Hospital for Sick Children.
Two of the family members have died of symptoms related to atypical
pneumonia. The provincial coroner is investigating one of the deaths.
Further laboratory testing is being conducted at the provincial laboratory
with additional specimens being sent to the federal laboratory in Winnipeg.
Atypical pneumonia is a severe form of pneumonia that begins with fever,
fatigue, shortness of breath and cough. In some cases, it can progress to
an acute respiratory distress syndrome.

TORONTO (CP) - Two members of one Toronto family have died from atypical
pneumonia and 4 other relatives were stricken with the unusual form of a
disease that is spreading through Asia, health officials said Friday.
All 4 are in Toronto hospitals, officials said. The disease has also
emerged in British Columbia, where one person was in hospital with the
illness and another has recovered, officials said, adding the west coast
cases were not related to the Toronto cases. [Information on the suspected
case in British Columbia is very scant - Mod.MPP]
Toronto Public Health said the [index case - an adult woman] died 5 Mar
2003, and her infant son, died 13 Mar 2003.
Three members of the family recently travelled to Hong Kong, officials said
at a news conference late Friday. No details on the family were immediately
released.
"The public health system is following standard procedure to notify the
public about the outbreak of a potential communicable disease," Dr. Karim
Kurji, of the Ontario Health Ministry, said in the release.
"We are confident that the hospitals are following all the necessary
infectious control procedures to contain and monitor the illness."
Ontario's coroner was investigating one of the deaths and laboratory
testing was being conducted at the provincial laboratory with additional
specimens being sent to the federal laboratory in Winnipeg.
Health Canada was also notified.
Atypical pneumonia has been blamed for several deaths in Asia and caused
fears of an epidemic in China in recent months. [see ProMED-mail
references below in the "see also" section].
The disease is an inflammation of the lungs caused by bacteria. It is known
as "atypical" because of the symptoms that it causes, which include fever,
headache, confusion and diarrhea. It can also cause a shortness of breath
and muscular stiffness. Typical pneumonia, on the other hand, usually
causes severe coughing and a fever.
[Atypical pneumonia has usually refers to pneumonia caused by certain
bacteria -- namely, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and
Chlamydia pneumoniae. Symptoms can include chills, fevers, cough -- may be
dry or productive of phlegm, headache, muscular stiffness and aching,
breathing may be rapid, shortness of breath may be present, loss of
appetite (anorexia), malaise, confusion (especially with Legionella), rash
(especially with Mycoplasma), diarrhea (especially with Legionella) from
<http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000079.htm#Definition>.
Another definition, which includes a broader range of etiologies and refers
to a type of pneumonia that does not follow the typical signs and symptoms
of pneumonia was the older more general use of the term atypical
pneumonia. A number of different viral and bacterial agents have been
associated with this description and include Chlamydia pneumonia,
psittacosis, Mycoplasma, influenza A or B, adenovirus, and Legionella. -
Mod.MPP]
Both types of pneumonia can be treated with antibiotics. [Traditional
antibiotics have not been shown to be effective against many viral agents.
- Mod.MPP]
The World Health Organization issued a global alert about the illness on
Wednesday, saying that until more is known about the outbreaks, patients
with atypical pneumonia who may be related to the outbreaks should be
"isolated with barrier nursing techniques."
"At the same time, WHO recommends that any suspect cases be reported to
national health authorities," the warning said.
In mid-February, the Chinese government reported that 305 cases of atypical
pneumonia had killed five people in Guangdong province.

[More information on these cases would be appreciated. While not confirmed
there was some information that the suspected case mentioned in British
Columbia did have a travel history that included Hong Kong prior to the
onset of illness. There have now been suspected cases of an acute
respiratory syndrome with an associated "atypical pneumonia" reported from
China (Hong Kong, Guangdong), VietNam, Singapore, Taiwan and now
Canada. We await more information on the studies currently underway
investigating the etiology of these clusters as well as more information on
the epidemiologic studies currently underway. - Mod.MPP]
