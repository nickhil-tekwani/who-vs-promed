The Red Cross in Guinea said on Wednesday [2 Jul 2014] it had been forced to suspend operations tackling Ebola virus disease in the country's southeast after staff there were threatened by a group of men armed with knives.

The incident on Tuesday [1 Jul 2014] in Gueckedou, about 650 km (403 miles) southeast of the capital Conakry, is the latest in a series against health workers undermining efforts to help the region's weak health systems fight one of the world's deadliest diseases.

"Locals wielding knives surrounded a marked Red Cross vehicle. We've suspended operations for safety reasons," a Red Cross official in West Africa said, asking not to be named. "I imagine this won't be the last time this happens," he added. A Medicins Sans Frontieres center in nearby Macenta was attacked by youths 2 months ago after staff there were accused of bringing the disease to Guinea.

Local and foreign doctors are battling a deep-rooted fear and lack of understanding of the disease, which has driven dozens of victims to evade treatment and made it harder to track patients.

Health ministers from 11 West African states are meeting in Accra, Ghana on Wednesday and Thursday [2-3 Jul 2014] to try to coordinate the regional response to the epidemic.

When M.S. contracted the deadly Ebola virus disease [EVD] in June 2014, he was confined to a tented isolation ward at Kenema in eastern Sierra Leone. But he didn't stay there long. Suspicious of the doctors in their masks and body-length protective suits, he slipped out and fled to the capital Freetown 300 km (185 mi) away. There, he was nursed in a private home for a week before being traced by officials and hurriedly returned, weak and frightened, to the Kenema unit. M.S. was tracked down in Freetown after messages about his escape were broadcast on local radio. The nurse friend treating him believed he had typhoid and is now being monitored for EVD. His mother, who traveled with him, is still missing.

With West Africa facing the deadliest Ebola outbreak ever, with 400 dead so far [now 467], this kind of fear and mistrust is driving dozens of victims to evade treatment, frustrating foreign and local doctors trying to contain the epidemic.

Dr. Amara Jambai, Sierra Leone's director of disease prevention and control, said at least 57 suspected and confirmed EVD cases were "missing," the victims having fled or gone into hiding. "When you lose cases that way, you will not know where the next case will appear," he told Reuters.

"My biggest problem, as it stands, is getting people to accept the disease," said Sheik Umar Khan, the doctor tasked with leading the fight against Ebola in Kenema's hospital. "These escapes, emanating from fear and misunderstanding, make our work even more difficult," he added.

Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) says Ebola is "out of control," located in at least 60 places across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Guinea has rejected this warning, saying it has its epidemic under control. But the governments' reluctance to fully admit and report the scale of outbreaks can also hamper containment.

The World Health Organization has called on other West African states to prepare to tackle the disease and is co-hosting a meeting of West African health ministers in Ghana this week to try to strengthen the region's response.

For months, Sierra Leone said its own suspected cases tested negative. Then, late last month [June 2014], it confirmed EVD in its remote northeast. Since then, there have been 191 laboratory confirmed cases, including 63 deaths, with many more suspected.

Kenema, now on the frontline of Sierra Leone's fight against EVD, is located in the diamond-rich east. Attacked by rebels during the 1991-2002 civil war, it has since become a bustling regional hub, the West African nation's 3rd largest city.

Sierra Leone's 1st Ebola case was a so-called "sowei," a traditional women's leader and healer who treated the sick crossing over from Guinea, according to Dr Mohamed Vandi, the chief medical officer for Kenema district.

By tradition, only women were allowed to touch or wash her dead body, so the majority of the next cases were also women.

Sierra Leone officials have since banned traditional funerals, and the bodies of Ebola victims must now be buried by health workers clad in green protective suits and face masks.

Schools in the Kenema area are closed and travel restricted.

At the Moala checkpoint on the road to Liberia, masked health workers take the temperature of all travelers to monitor for anyone who might be carrying a fever. But many still put faith in traditional methods. At the same Moala checkpoint, police and soldiers tied herbal rope bracelets around travellers' wrists, telling them a local traditional healer had been told in a dream that doing so could ward off EVD.

Posters on walls warn of EVD symptoms, urging sufferers to go to hospital. But Sierra Leone's health system is weak; the country has the highest rate of maternal and infant deaths in the world, according to U.N. figures. The Kenema isolation unit consists of 2 tents erected just meters away from the main hospital, where 2 doctors and 2 ambulances are based to cover a district of 800 000 people. Donors and international health organizations have rushed specialized equipment to the zone, but staff complain about shortages, even of basic items like gloves.

A local population with little knowledge of the disease can be easily spooked by rumors. Vandi said stories were circulating that doctors were removing limbs of Ebola victims before burying them. Police have been deployed and last week fired tear gas at the hospital to prevent relatives from trying to retrieve bodies. Terrified by such reports, I.M., who came down with symptoms of the disease, initially fled the ambulance sent to take her to the hospital. "When I thought I had the sickness, I ran away into the bushes and hid," she told Reuters. She only emerged from hiding when the diarrhoea and vomiting became too bad to bear. She was treated and recovered.

Khan rejected MSF's statement that the disease was out of control in the region. He said more cases were coming to light because of improved official surveillance. "People are coming to terms with the fact EVD is a reality," he said. Vandi, the Kenema medical officer, said if the diamond town could beat the disease, the rest of Sierra Leone could do so.

[3] Liberia: death of expat doctor
Date: 2 Jul 2014

FrontPageAfrica has reliably learned that a foreign doctor from Uganda serving in Liberia has become the latest victim of the deadly ebolavirus that is pillaging lives in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Among the new deaths has been a man who was a surgical doctor assigned at the Redemption Hospital in New Kru Town [Monrovia]. Health authorities confirming the doctor's death referred to him as Dr. Sam and stated that he died at the John F. Kennedy Medical Center Cholera Unit where he was being treated.

Health workers in Liberia are at risk for the deadly virus, and many have expressed fear that they might come in direct contact with an Ebola virus disease [EVD] patient without even realizing it. The Ugandan doctor is the 4th death among health workers [in Liberia]. A physician assistant from the Tandapolie clinic in Caldwell was recently confirmed dead from the disease.

Mr. Tolbert Nyenswah, Assistant Minister for Curative Services at the ministry of health has called on health workers across the country to take universal precaution to protect them against the disease. "We call it the barrier netting [sic, nursing?] method; that is, you must wear gloves during examination of a patient, even if they were not an EVD patient," he told FrontPageAfrica. "What we call infection control in health facilities should be adhered to. So we are calling on health workers across the country, including private and public facilities, clinics and everywhere to ensure the highest standard and level to protect themselves."

Following the reported death of 8 persons including a health worker at the Redemption Hospital in New Kru Town in Monrovia, almost 3 weeks ago, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare is reporting 6 new cases as of 30 Jun 2014. The ministry states that out of the 6 are 2 suspected, one probable, and 3 confirmed to have the deadly virus. The Assistant Minister for Curative Services states that there are 96 cumulative (suspected, probable and confirmed) cases.

The total confirmed cases in Liberia now since the 2nd outbreak as of 30 Jun 2014 is 56 nationally, according to the ministry of health; 2 healthcare workers are reported to have died from the disease as of 30 Jun 2014, and the ministry is reporting that there are 6 new deaths, 56 deaths cumulative, and the national case fatality rate stands at 65 percent.

The ministry is also reporting that 2 persons suspected of being infected with the virus have traveled from Voinjama District in Lofa County to Monrovia and that there was no specimen collected in Voinjama as of 30 Jun 2014 because the county laboratory supervisor could not be found. The report says there are no Ebola related posters in Voinjama and that the county is in need of a vehicle for the burial team in Lofa County.

The latest update states that there is an acute shortage of thermometers for the contact tracers; confusion is brewing as to whether the contact tracers should record temperatures and that the Red Cross in Lofa is reluctant to do so as they do not want to expose the contact tracers.

There are 17 newly reported Ebola cases, 442 persons listed to have come in direct contact with people who have the disease, 256 in Montserrado, 158 in Lofa and 28 in Margibi counties, according to the ministry. The ministry states that 397 contacts were seen on 30 Jun 2014, and a total of 7 specimens were collected.

Liberia has made it a crime to shield people who are suspected of being sick from the deadly virus. President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, during a nationwide address over the weekend, pledged prosecution for anyone caught hiding suspected Ebola patients.

"Major issues confronting the response teams include, but [are] not limited to, keeping sick people in healing centers, prayer homes and other non-medical centers," said President Sirleaf. "These practices create public health hazards to families, neighborhoods and other innocent people. It is illegal under our public health law to expose the people to health hazards such as EVD. Let this warning go out: Anyone found or reported to be holding suspected EVD cases in homes or prayer houses will be prosecuted under the laws of Liberia."

Doctors Without Borders last week declared that the EVD outbreak that has affected Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea is "out of control." It states that more than 600 cases have now been reported in the region, with the patients experiencing headache, fever and internal and external bleeding. "The virus kills up to 90 percent of the people it infects, but it leaps from person to person only through contact with bodily fluids," states Doctors Without Borders [but 65 percent so far in Liberia, see above].

The death of another health worker from the deadly disease shows the risk healthcare givers are exposed to in combating the deadly virus.

[This is the 1st report of an international volunteer dying of EVD in the region, a very lamentable and avoidable occurrence.

Patients fleeing from hospitals and hiding in homes remain a major problem.

In view of attacks on health workers in Guinea, it seems as though local staff of international organizations in Guinea are in need of security.
