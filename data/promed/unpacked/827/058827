Abstract
--------
The mechanisms underlying virus emergence are rarely well understood, making the appearance of outbreaks largely unpredictable. Bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8), an arthropod-borne virus of ruminants, emerged in livestock in northern Europe in 2006, spreading to most European countries by 2009 and causing losses of billions of euros. Although the outbreak was successfully controlled through vaccination by early 2010, puzzlingly, a closely related BTV-8 strain re-emerged in France in 2015, triggering a 2nd outbreak that is still ongoing. The origin of this virus and the mechanisms underlying its re-emergence are unknown. Here, we performed phylogenetic analyses of 164 whole BTV-8 genomes sampled throughout the 2 outbreaks. We demonstrate consistent clock-like virus evolution during both epizootics but found negligible evolutionary change between them. We estimate that the ancestor of the 2nd outbreak dates from the height of the 1st outbreak in 2008. This implies that the virus had not been replicating for multiple years prior to its re-emergence in 2015. Given the absence of any known natural mechanism that could explain BTV-8 persistence over this long period without replication, we hypothesise that the 2nd outbreak could have been initiated by accidental exposure of livestock to frozen material contaminated with virus from approximately 2008. Our work highlights new targets for pathogen surveillance programmes in livestock and illustrates the power of genomic epidemiology to identify pathways of infectious disease emergence.

[The above results of phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses of BTV-8 virus samples, collected during the 1st and 2nd European outbreaks, appeared in the 'short reports' section of PLOS Biology in April 2020 (PLOS says: "Short reports offer exciting novel biological findings that may trigger new research directions"). Its concluding hypothesis suggests that the 2nd BTV-8 epizootic, which started in central France in 2015, presented a case of "frozen evolution" since it "could have been initiated by accidental exposure of livestock to frozen material contaminated with virus from approximately 2008." The 2 epizootics are presented geographically in Fig 1 - 'Emergence and re-emergence of BTV-8 in Europe' (2006 - 2018); see in the source URL; zoom in to view the individual foci.

The studies allowed the gaining insights into the mechanisms that may have enabled BTV-8 to re-emerge in France in 2015. The results, based upon phylogenetic analyses of 164 whole BTV-8 genomes sampled throughout the 2 outbreaks, have encouraged the publication of a new paper (item 2) presenting hitherto unpublished animal trials undertaken in Belgium and France in 2010. We understand that when these trials were accomplished, there was hardly any interest in their outcome as the (initial) BTV-8 epizootic was regarded resolved, and it was generally perceived, at that time, that prevailing animal-health rules would exclude frozen semen becoming a vehicle for (re)introduction of the virus. - Mod.AS]

Abstract
--------
Transmission of bluetongue (BT) virus serotype 8 (BTV-8) via artificial insemination of contaminated frozen semen from naturally infected bulls was investigated in 2 independent experiments. Healthy, BT-negative heifers were hormonally synchronized and artificially inseminated at oestrus. In total, 6 groups of 3 heifers each [totalling 18 heifers] received semen from 4 batches derived from 3 bulls naturally infected with BTV-8. Each experiment included one control heifer that was not inseminated and that remained BT negative throughout. BTV viraemia and seroconversion were determined in 8 out of 18 inseminated heifers, and BTV was isolated from 5 of these animals. These 8 heifers only displayed mild clinical signs of BT, if any at all, but 6 of them experienced pregnancy loss between weeks 4 and 8 of gestation, and 5 of them became BT PCR and antibody positive. The other 2 infected heifers gave birth at term to 2 healthy and BT-negative calves. The BT viral load varied among the semen batches used, and this had a significant impact on the infection rate, the time of onset of viraemia post artificial insemination, and the gestational stage at which pregnancy loss occurred. These results, which confirm unusual features of BTV-8 infection, should not be extrapolated to infection with other BTV strains without thorough evaluation. This study also adds weight to the hypothesis that the re-emergence of BTV-8 in France in 2015 may be attributable to the use of contaminated bovine semen.

[The 1st experiment began in March 2010 at the experimental farm of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine (University of Ghent, Belgium), during the vector-free period (when vector activity is very low). This period started in Belgium on 14 Dec 2009 and ended on 3 May 2010. Special measures were undertaken to monitor any _Culicoides_ activity. The 2nd experiment began in September 2010 at a facility of INRAE (France's National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment) in Tours, France. This was the height of the vector season, so the animals were housed in a biocontainment level 3 conditioned isolation unit.

The appearance of BTV-8 in Europe, initially in the 3-border region of Germany-Belgium-Netherlands in August 2006, was puzzling, and its origin and route of introduction are yet to be satisfactorily explained. Its recurrence, in central France, was also puzzling. ProMED published several posts addressing its assessments (archive numbers 20150915.3646112, 20160409.4149402, 20160312.4088596, 20190430.6448057). An example that subscribers may consider visiting is DEFRA (UK) "Risk assessment for Bluetongue Virus (BTV-8): risk assessment of entry into the United Kingdom - Qualitative Risk Assessment" published 6 Feb 2016. It presented 7 alternative sources of the 2015 reemergence of BTV-8 in France (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/714607/qra-BTV8-UK-160212.pdf). DEFRA's BTV-8 risk assessments are updated and published periodically; the most recent one, published on 30 Oct 2020, included the repeated advice: "Livestock owners and field vets in the UK should note that the BTV-8 strain that reemerged in northwest Europe in 2015 can be spread by trans-placental transmission to cause infection in cattle and sheep foetuses. Bluetongue should therefore be considered in the differential diagnosis when investigating poor fertility and offspring born with congenital brain malformations."

OIE's updated recommendations for importation of semen of ruminants and camelids from countries or zones free or seasonally free from bluetongue are included in OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code, article 8.3.9, and for importation from countries or zones infected with BTV, in article 8.3.10. Both are available in Chapter 8.3. - "Infection with bluetongue virus" at https://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_bluetongue.htm. The intranational trade/dissemination of semen should be spelled out in the national legislation of each country. When concerning EC members, the European Commission's regulations apply. The legal aspect is addressed in the 2021 paper. - Mod.AS
