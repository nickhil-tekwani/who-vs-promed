In a shocking case of food poisoning in Kanye, a child is said to
have died, whilst about a hundred were admitted to Kanye Seventh Day
Adventist (SDA) Hospital.

According to Kanye deputy officer commanding, superintendent Obonyeng
Kelebeng, a 9-year-old girl died last weekend [11-12 Oct 2008] after
eating food at a funeral in Selokolela, a settlement several
kilometers west of Kanye. He said that the girl was dead upon arrival
at Athlone Hospital in Lobatse.

Kanye SDA Hospital deputy matron, Keabitsa Ramantele, said that they
received patients from the settlement who were complaining of
diarrhea and vomiting last Sunday [12 Oct 2008]. She said they all
reported that they had eaten samp and meat at a funeral in Selokolela.

Ramantele said that so far they have received about 98 patients from
Selokolela. "Yesterday [15 Oct 2008] we consulted and sent back some
of them home, while we had 30 whom we hospitalized overnight," she
said. She said that because the hospital was already overcrowded,
they had to refer 13 patients, also suffering from food poisoning, to
Athlone hospital in Lobatse, which is 45 km (28 mi) from Kanye.

[The etiology of the illness here cannot be easily surmised from the
information given without an approximate incubation from the meal to
the onset of symptoms, whether fever was present or not, and how long
the illness lasted. Bacterial, viral, protozoan, enteric toxins, as
well as toxic chemicals can be considered.

Samp (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samp>) is dried corn kernels that
have been chopped until broken but not as fine as mealie-meal or
mealie rice. The coating around the kernel loosens and is removed
during the pounding and stamping process. It can be served with beef,
lamb, poultry, and in stuffings.
