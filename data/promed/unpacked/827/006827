cases of human infection in Canada and 10 deaths (an increase of 87 cases
and 3 deaths since Mon 6 Oct 2003). Saskatchewan remains the most severely

Province/No. probable cases/No. confirmed cases/No. of deaths/
Nova Scotia / 0 / 1* / 0 /
Quebec /15 / 2 / 0 /

Total 839 / 378 / 10
*Linked to travel outside of province
** 2 probable cases; death due to other causes
[The probable cases in British Columbia and Yukon, and the confirmed cases
in Nova Scotia are considered to be travel-related and not indigenous. The
2 fatal cases and one of the probable cases in Ontario are considered to be
travel-related and not indigenous cases. Since Mon 6 Oct 2003 the number of
probable or confirmed cases has increased by 71 from 1130 to 1217. In all,
78.8 percent (967/1227) of the cases and deaths in 2003 have occurred in
the prairie provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta.
In 2002, there were 416 probable or confirmed cases of human West Nile
virus infection in Canada and 21 deaths attributed to the virus. All the
deaths and most of the cases occurred in Ontario and Quebec, in contrast to
the situation in 2003 when few cases have been reported from Ontario and
Quebec, and overall considerably fewer fatalities. - Mod.CP]
Equines - cumulative data

As of Wed 15 Oct 2003, 446 presumptive or confirmed equine cases have been
reported; Nova Scotia (1), Quebec (8), Ontario (42), Manitoba (53),
Saskatchewan (162), Alberta (180).
[Since the previous update of Mon 6 Oct 2003, the number of presumptive or
confirmed equine cases of West Nile virus infection has increased by 40
(all except 2 reported from Saskatchewan and Alberta). The single equine
case reported from Nova Scotia is the first equine case from this province.

As of Wed 15 Oct 2003, 534 pools of mosquitoes have tested positive; Quebec
(88), Ontario (121), Manitoba (259), Saskatchewan (35), Alberta (31).
[This represents an increase of 17 West Nile virus-positive mosquito pools
since Mon 6 Oct 2003. In contrast to the data for other animals, the
greatest number of West Nile virus-positive mosquito pools was recorded in
the province of Manitoba (48.5 percent), whereas relatively few were found
in Saskatchewan (6.6 percent) and Alberta (5.8 percent). There have been no
extensions of range. - Mod.CP]

[The totals for Canada for 2003 so far are 12 056 birds submitted for
testing, 11 158 birds tested, and 1608 confirmed West Nile virus-positive.
In addition there were 3770 sightings of dead birds. This represents an
