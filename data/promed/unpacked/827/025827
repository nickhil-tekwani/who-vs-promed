A person has died and 9 others are in serious condition because of an
unidentified disease at Rel Village of Kailapalmandau, in Dadeldhura
district. The disease has affected many other people.
A 31-year-old woman died of the disease on the way to Nepalgunj
Medical Hospital (NMH), said Dr. Arun Budha posted at the local Team Hospital.
The local hospital suspected that the patients fell sick after eating
the meat of a wild boar. They presented symptoms of muscle pain,
fever, respiratory problems, and swelling of hands and legs.
Dr. Budha said that the Team Hospital was unable to reach any
conclusion about the disease. Some patients are in serious condition
and the number of patients is increasing every day. There are 2
doctors in the District Health Office (DHO) but only one of them is
handling the cases.
Bir Bahadur Rawal, acting officer of the DHO, said that they had
informed the Department of Health Services (DHS) about the situation.
A 2-member team of health assistants reached the area on 16 Mar 2007
and started treating the patients.
Meanwhile, in Kathmandu, Dr. Manas Kumar Benarjee, Director of the
Epidemiology and Disease Control Unit of the DHS, quoting the
villagers, said that most sick people were females and children, and
that the males did not fall sick as they drank alcohol with the meat,
while women did not. Dr. Benarjee said that the affected people
presented diarrhea, difficulty swallowing, sore throat, and
"immobility" of upper and lower lips. Among the hospitalized people,
6 are undergoing treatment at Nepalgunj Medical Hospital and 3 at
Seti Zonal Hospital at Dhangadi, he said.

[Dadeldhura district is in the west-central part of the Far Western
Region, as can be found on a map of Nepal at
<http://ncthakur.itgo.com/map04.htm>. - Mod.LL.
The symptoms of muscle pain, fever, diarrhea, respiratory problems,
and swelling of hands and legs fit well with trichinosis. Infection
with _Trichinella_ will be strongly supported if the patients have a
raise in eosinophil count. Wild boar is a typical source of infection
with _Trichinella_ worldwide. - Mod.EP]

appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
