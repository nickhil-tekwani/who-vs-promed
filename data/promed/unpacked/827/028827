Schistosoma haematobium, southern Corsica, Cavu river: new cases
----------------------------------------------------------------
ECDC reported in May 2014 on a cluster of _Schistosoma haematobium_ infection most probably acquired by swimming in the Cavu river in Corsica, France during the years 2011 to 2013 and recommended screening of all exposed persons.

Meanwhile, we performed serological testing for schistosomiasis in more than 100 exposed persons (IFT using cercarial antigen and ELISAs using egg and adult worm antigens from _S. mansoni_).

Three out of 4 members of a German family [exposed in the Cavu river] showed high antibody titers with all tests. In an 11-year-old boy vital _S. haematobium_ eggs were found in urine specimens (5-10/ml) processed by sedimentation and filtration techniques. The patient showed moderate blood eosinophila (490/microliter) and intermittent leucocyturia but no clinical symptoms suggestive of urinary schistosomiasis. Repeated parasitological investigations were negative in the other family members. All family members received a one-day treatment with praziquantel which was repeated after 4 to 6 weeks.

Exposure of this family was limited to several occasions of swimming in the Cavu river during August 2013. This report shows that significant infection with _S. haematobium_ may be acquired even with very limited exposure and that exposure risk still existed in the summer of 2013.

[ProMED thanks Dr Michael Pritsch and Professor Thomas Loscher for the above report of infection with _S. haematobium_ in the Cavu river, Corsica, France.

Other cases from the Cavu river have been reported previously (Berry A. et al. _Schistosomiasis haematobium_, Corsica, France. Emerg Infect Dis. Sep 2014; 20(9): 1595-7). In that report the authors speculate that the infection may have been introduced in 2011 or 2013 and they write that "Additional molecular investigations are being conducted to assess genetic diversity of this isolate from Corsica and the geographic origin of the introduced parasite." To our knowledge, this genetic analysis has not been published.

Another case has been reported in a 12-year-old boy from Dusseldorf, Germany also swimming in the Cavu river (Holtfreter MC et al. _Schistosoma haematobium_ infections acquired in Corsica, France, August 2013. Euro Surveill. 2014 Jun 5;19(22). pii: 20821).

We are missing information on infections in local residents and data from surveys of local residents. - Mod.EP
