Dengue fever cases rise sharply in Vietnam
------------------------------------------
HANOI: Dengue fever cases are rising sharply in Vietnam, with a 62 per cent
increase in 2001 over the previous year, local media reported on Fri 28 Dec
2001. The newspaper Tuoi Tre ["Youth", said that 39 563 people have
contracted the disease this year. So far 81 have died from dengue, a 59 per
cent increase from last year, the newspaper reported.
The newspaper gave no reason for the rise. The southern Mekong Delta region
has the highest rate of the mosquito-borne disease, the report stated. Many
farmers in the Mekong Delta use containers to store rain water and the high
humidity provides an ideal environment for mosquitoes to breed [It is
actually the still, dark water in such containers that offers the
mosquitoes optimal conditions. Â­ Mod.JW.
There is no cure or vaccine for dengue, a viral illness that causes fever,
joint pains and chills. Some strains [may cause internal bleeding and
death. [Alternately, this may be the result of a second infection by a
dengue virus of heterologous serotype. - Mod.CP. Officials at the Ministry
of Health were not available for comment.
[In contrast the Tuoi Tre newspaper reported that fewer cases of malaria
have been reported in Vietnam. In total 242 018 people have contracted
malaria this year, over 2 per cent less than last year, and 76 people have
died from disease, a 45 per cent fall.
