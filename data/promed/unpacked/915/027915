Ascochyta outbreak in highlands chickpeas
-----------------------------------------
There is another confirmed outbreak of ascochyta blight (AB) in a
Central Queensland chickpea crop located south of Emerald on the
Central Highlands. Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries
[DPI&F] senior development extension officer, Anne Shepherd, said
that while the confirmed infection of this crop is disappointing,
growers and agricultural consultants were well informed and well
positioned to provide effective ascochyta blight management advice.

Pulse Australia northern region development officer Gordon Cumming
said Central Queensland could no longer claim to be AB-free, but
remained a low risk location. The 1st reported Central region
outbreak was reported in the Dawson-Callide on 22 Aug [2008] [see
ProMED-mail post no. 20080828.2698], which currently involves 7
chickpea crops on 5 properties within the same district.

Mr Cumming said growers need to adopt suitable AB monitoring and
control strategies in the coming seasons to ensure the region remains
at low risk. "This means ensuring that all planting seed is sourced
from Central Queensland and that all seed -- especially
grower-retained -- is treated with a registered fungicide seed
dressing," Mr Cumming said.

Ms Shepherd said the industry's recommended response plan prepared in
2006 by DPI&F and Pulse Australia outlines the AB disease management
strategy and has been rigorously adopted by the involved growers.
"Growers and industry consultants are to be congratulated for their
quick response," Ms Shepherd said. She urged growers to remain
vigilant and inspect all crops that are still green for AB symptoms.

The bulk of this year's estimated 50 000-hectare (123 553-acre)
chickpea winter crop is starting to hay off, which will make
identification of the brown lesions on AB infected plants difficult.
"Any suspect or confirmed AB infected crops should be harvested last
and none of the seed should be graded in Central Queensland or
retained for future planting," Ms Shepherd said. "Particular
attention should be given to machinery hygiene during the harvest,
and equipment must be thoroughly cleaned before entering a new property."

[Ascochyta blight (AB) of chickpea is caused by the fungus _Ascochyta
rabiei_ and is considered the most important disease of chickpeas
worldwide. The pathogen attacks all aerial portions of the plant and
is specific to chickpeas. Disease development is favoured by cool,
wet conditions. Symptoms include spots and lesions on leaves, stems,
and pods, which may lead to partial wilting, or the whole shoot may
break off and the plant will die. Infected seeds are shriveled,
spotted, and discoloured.

The pathogen can survive on infected plant material for at least 2
years under dry conditions, but viability is lost rapidly in high
humidity. It is seed-borne at a high rate of 50-80 percent. Seed
transmission is the primary mode of spread both locally and
worldwide. Disease management includes cultural methods, seed
treatment, prophylactic fungicide applications, and use of varieties
with improved resistance.

_A. rabiei_ has previously caused serious losses to chickpea crops in
southern Australia. _A. lentis_ causes a similar blight in lentils
and _A. pinodes_ in peas.
