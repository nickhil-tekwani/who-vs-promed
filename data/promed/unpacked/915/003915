Hundreds of buffaloes and cows have died due to the outbreak of black quarter disease in several areas of Cholistan, The Express Tribune has learnt.

Farmers from Khairpur Tamewali, Budhwala Toba, Kokar Toba, Sathoowala Toba, and Sher Khan Toba say they have lost hundreds of animals to the disease, which they blame on the "negligence of the Cholistan Development Authority's Livestock Wing. We informed the department about the outbreak, but no veterinary teams have come to visit our farms so far. If they don't take action, we will end up losing thousands of cows and buffaloes," a farmer told The Express Tribune.

Farmers Athar Wagi and Maratab Shah said their cattle had not been vaccinated for 2 years.

Livestock Deputy Director Dr Sohail Nasir said the disease had spread because the animals were not vaccinated on time.

"The Veterinary Research Institute supplied us vaccines for livestock in October last year [2012], but they caused adverse reactions among the animals they were tested on, so we had to return them," he said. The institute has still not supplied a fresh batch of vaccines, Nasir added.

Nasir said such outbreaks usually occurred after rainy weather. "If the Veterinary Research Institute does not provide us with the vaccines, we will lose more animals to the black quarter disease," he said.

[Black quarter disease, also called blackleg, is an acute, febrile disease of cattle and sheep caused by _Clostridium chauvoei_ (feseri), characterized by crepitant emphysematous swelling, usually in the heavy muscles. It is found worldwide and is not included in OIE's list of internationally notifiable diseases. The fatality rate is high.

The affected muscle is dark red to black and dry and spongy; it has a sweetish odor and is infiltrated with small bubbles but with little edema. Field diagnoses are confirmed by laboratory demonstration of _C. chauvoei_ in affected muscle. The samples of muscle should be taken as soon after death as possible. The fluorescent antibody test for _C. chauvoei_ is rapid and reliable.

A bacterin containing _C. chauvoei_ is safe and reliable for the immunisation of both cattle and sheep. Calves should be vaccinated twice, 2 weeks apart, at 2-6 months of age; in high-risk areas, revaccination may be necessary at one year and every 5 years thereafter. When outbreaks are encountered, all susceptible cattle should be vaccinated and treated prophylactically with penicillin to prevent new cases, which may develop for up to 10 days, at which point the bacterin provides protection. In some areas, multicomponent clostridial vaccines are warranted. Treatment of clinical cases with parenteral and multiple local injections of penicillin may be attempted but is frequently unsuccessful.

Confirmation of the media reported outbreaks by the local animal health authorities is requested. - Mod.AS
