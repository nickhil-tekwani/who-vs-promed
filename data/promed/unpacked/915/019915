SMALLPOX, HUMAN REMAINS, LIKELIHOOD: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
============================================================

From: E. Vardas <VARDAS@niv.ac.za>
The National Institute for Virology and Reitfontein Infectious Diseases
Hospital in Johannesburg are facing a situation of some political and
virological concern. Unilateral decisions have been taken by some government
officials to allow low income housing projects to begin construction on the
grounds of Reitfontein hospital. The issues here are not to prevent
residential development, but rather to ensure the safety of the residents,
builders and other individuals exposed to the site, now and in the future.
To put the above statements into context, I can refer your readers to a
"Commentary" (which should be there by end of the day!) on our home page,
http://www.healthlink.org.za/niv/. In summary, the site intended for the low
cost housing is on the site of a smallpox cemetery. The last "smallpox"
burials on this land occurred in the 1950's. The land presently does not
have access to amenities such as electricity, sewage and water supplies.
These must be established before any residential development can occur. The
possibility that bodies of smallpox patients may be exhumed in the course of
this development is unfortunately very real since the records of burial
sites were not well kept. Smallpox immunisation is unavailable and if viable
smallpox is released into the non-immune population of Johannesburg (? the
world) we have a disaster on our hands. Perhaps the risks are small or
negligible, and we should not worry about this at all. I'd be interested to
know what you and your readers think.

[This question, and ones just like it, are asked all the time. The mere
mention of smallpox is enough to make any of us dyspeptic. Although the
logistics of the question differ, the answer is usually the same. However,
for a definitive opinion, we turned to Professor Frank Fenner, John Curtin
School of Medical Research, Australia National University, Canberra, the
world authority on smallpox and Chair of the WHO committee that is overseeing
the final demise of smallpox (variola major) virus. What follows is Dr.
Fenner's very prompt and generous reply (unmoderated because, while I have a
bit of nerve, I ain't stoopid. -- Mod CHC]
"I think the risks associated with the remains of smallpox patients buried
over 40 years ago are vanishingly remote. Smallpox virus was reasonably heat-
resistant (as viruses go), but the longest known survival (by about 12 years)
was the 13 years recorded for some scabs stored at room temperature in a
Dutch laboratory. This was in scabs. I assume that all the flesh on the
bodies of patients buried some 40 years ago would have gone long ago, and the
bones would certainly not harbour the virus.
Two other points:
1. Keith Dumbell, the world's greatest authority on smallpox virus, lives
in Somerset, Cape West, South Africa. His telephone number is 27 24 554 695.
2. WHO still holds some stocks of smallpox vaccine for use in emergencies.
If the "impossible" happened, vaccine should be available from Geneva
overnight."
