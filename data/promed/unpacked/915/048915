The United Nations says 13 people have died so far in an outbreak of cholera in South Sudan. The 1st case of cholera was reported in the capital, Juba, on 15 May 2014. As of Tue 20 May 2014, the number of cases was 266.

The spokesman for the UN secretary-general told reporters on Wed 21 May 2014 that humanitarian workers are trying to improve sanitation inside UN bases where thousands of civilians have taken refuge since violence erupted in December 2013. Stephane Dujarric says easing the "overcrowded" bases in cities such as Bentiu and Malakal remains a top UN priority.

Efforts to fight the cholera outbreak also include vaccinating 13 000 people so far in Bentiu.
