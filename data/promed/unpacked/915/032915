On Thursday afternoon [18 Feb 2021], Health Canada declared an outbreak of salmonellosis in 2 Atlantic provinces. The federal agency says 57 cases of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis illness were confirmed, of which 25 are in Newfoundland and Labrador, and 32 in Nova Scotia.

According to the release, these individuals became sick between late October 2020 and January 2021. 19 of them have been hospitalized, but no deaths have been reported to date. The agency says 68 per cent of those infected were female, and cases were detected in individuals aged between 2 and 98.

In October 2020, a recall was issued for eggs from Hilly Acres Farm in Nova Scotia due to possible _Salmonella_ contamination. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency says the products were distributed across Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia. "This recall was triggered by the company test results," the CFIA [Canadian Food Inspection Agency] stated in a food recall warning.

The items recalled included Farmer John Eyking, Eyking Delite, Compliments, and Nova Eggs. Hilly Acres Farm in Cape Breton began a voluntary recall of eggs due to a possible salmonellosis concern, and that's when the Canadian Food Inspection Agency got notified.

"The recalled eggs are now past their shelf-life and are no longer available for purchase," said Health Canada in a news release. "Some individuals who became sick in this outbreak reported exposure to recalled eggs; however, there are a number of recent ill individuals that do not."

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is continuing a food safety investigation and will update its food recall warnings if other high-risk products are recalled.

Here is Health Canada's advice for reducing the risk of becoming ill with salmonellosis:
- always handle raw eggs carefully and cook eggs and egg-based foods to an internal temperature of at least 74 C [165 F];
- do not eat raw or undercooked eggs;
- when purchasing eggs, choose only refrigerated eggs with clean, uncracked shells
- always wash your hands before and after you touch raw eggs;
- eggs (raw or cooked) should not be kept at room temperature for more than 2 hours;
- use pasteurized egg products instead of raw eggs when preparing foods that are not heated;
- do not taste raw dough, batter, or any other product containing raw eggs;
- microwave cooking of raw eggs is not recommended;
- sanitize countertops, cutting boards, and utensils before and after preparing eggs or egg-based foods;
- do not re-use plates, cutting boards, or utensils that have come in contact with raw eggs unless they have been thoroughly washed and sanitized;
- use paper towels to wipe kitchen surfaces, or change dishcloths daily to avoid the risk of cross-contamination and the spread of bacteria;
- do not prepare food for other people if you think you are sick with salmonellosis.

Health Canada says most people who become ill with salmonella will recover fully within a week. "It is possible for some people to be infected with the bacteria and to not get sick or show any symptoms, but to still be able to spread the infection to others," the agency said.

[Salmonellosis is often thought to be associated with cracked eggs or eggs dirty with fecal matter, a problem controlled by cleaning procedures implemented in the egg industry. It is clearly the case, however, that most of the salmonellosis outbreaks linked to eggs were associated with uncracked, disinfected grade A eggs, or foods containing such eggs. The undamaged eggs become contaminated during ovulation and thus were contaminated with the bacteria before the eggshell was formed. To avoid this, uncooked eggs should only be used as an ingredient, if pasteurized. - Mod.LL
