Malaria in Aswan, Egypt
-----------------------
Today [30 May 2014], Egypt's health ministry announced the presence of 11 cases positive for malaria in Aswan. Most of these cases now attend the clinics at Edfu Fever Hospital. Most Egyptian news reported that all of these cases came from a single village in Edfu (Al-Adwa).

[A Ministry of Health team works in the field] for disease surveillance and to evaluate the possibility of disease risk. Scientists in Egypt are interested in knowing if these cases are imported from a neighboring country or not.

A new call for a malaria control program in Egypt may be needed after the successful control program for malaria and the absence of malaria infection circulation during the last years.

[Egypt reported 179 malaria cases in 2012 (World Malaria Report 2013, http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world_malaria_report_2013/en/) but it is not reported whether they were imported or autochthonous cases.

There is still malaria in Egypt and 2 studies from 2009 highlight the focus in El-Fayoum Governorate (Faiyum Oasis). The 1st study (Dahesh SM et al: Malariometric parasitological survey in El-Fayoum Governorate, Egypt. J Egypt Soc Parasitol. 2009; 39(1): 213-25; abstract available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19530623) found 52 cases of _Plasmodium falciparum_ out of 7236 examined. In 74 percent of the parasite positive cases gametocytes were found.

The 2nd study (Dahesh SM et al: Socioeconomic and environmental factors affecting malaria infection in Fayoum Governorate, Egypt. J Egypt Soc Parasitol. 2009; 39(2): 511-23; abstract available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19795758) found that the risk of malaria infection increased with the decrease in socioeconomic status and educational level. The indoor use of 5 percent malathion did not affect the malaria infection.

Thus, the reported focus in Aswan seems to be new, and ProMED will be happy to post further information. - Mod.EP
