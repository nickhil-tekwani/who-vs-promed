With reference to the posting Q fever - Australia (02): background 20110403.1029 from the Gideon database referring to the Q fever
vaccine as being effective for 5 years, I draw your attention to the
Australian Immunisation Handbook 9th Edition which states:

"Immunity produced by the vaccine appears to be long lasting (in
excess of 5 years). Until further information becomes available,
revaccination or booster doses of the vaccine are not recommended
because of the risk of accentuated local adverse events."
