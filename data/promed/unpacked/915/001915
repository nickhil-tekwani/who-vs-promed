Last fall [2001] in more than 2 dozen elementary and middle schools
scattered across the USA [and several in Canada, according to
newswire reports at the time - Mod.MPP], groups of children started
breaking out with itchy red rashes that seemed to fade away when the
children went home -- and to pop up again when they returned to
school. It did not conform to any known pattern of viral or bacterial
illness.
The children had no other symptoms: no fever, no runny noses, no
headaches or joint pain or respiratory complaints. Moreover, they were
not passing their rashes on to parents or siblings outside school. Large
groups (a dozen here, several dozen there) came down with it
simultaneously, or within hours, rather than over the course of days or
weeks, as you would expect with person-to-person transmission of a
contagious illness. In many of the outbreaks, girls accounted for a
majority of the cases. Since neither germs nor the other likely culprit,
environmental poisons, make a habit of discriminating by sex, this was
puzzling.
Blood tests on a number of the children ruled out, in all except one
school, the virus that causes a mild rash known as Fifth disease.
Environmental investigations of the other affected schools failed to
turn up evidence of chemical or biological hazards.
The rash outbreaks started in Indiana on 4 Oct 2001. They turned up
next in northern Virginia, at Marsteller Middle School, where hazmat
[hazardous materials] crews scoured the building and found no
[chemical] explanation.
During the winter holidays, the school rashes abated, but in January
and February [2002] they turned up again.
In late February [2002] Quakertown, Pennsylvania, reported 238 cases
in 9 schools where all environmental testing had been negative.
In Oregon, it all started on 4 Feb 2002 at an Elementary School in
Medford, near the California border. Yvonne H. Chilcoat, a public
health nurse who coordinated the county's investigation, noted that of
the 67 children and 11 adults affected by it, 62 were female. Chilcoat
exchanged e-mail with a public health nurse from St. Catherines in
Ontario [Canada] who had helped investigate a rash outbreak in an
elementary school there last March [2002] and had concluded that it
was probably ''hysterical.'' But while the Ontario nurse confirmed to me
that hysteria ''was one of our hypotheses,'' it was not one, she says, that
she ever shared with the affected children or their parents -- or, indeed,
with the public at large. [Not surprisingly -- parents don't like to be told
their children are suffering from hysteria. - Mod.JW]
Then 2 weeks later [21 Feb 2002] a similar rash popped up at a very
different school, about an hour west of Portland, in Sheridan. There,
too, the rash came on abruptly and struck mainly girls. By the end of
that day, about 50 students were complaining of some kind of rash.
One parent [noted] that the rash came out only at school and went
away ''10 or 15 minutes after the girls left school.''
A resident in preventive medicine who had interviewed and examined
15 kids for the Oregon health department did not see anything unusual
or even similar in these conditions; she saw, ''early acne, dry skin and
quite a few insect bites.''
By early April 2002, the rash or something like it had turned up in 2
Massachusetts towns, South Dennis and Billerica.
There could yet be an environmental cause found, though it is highly
unlikely to be the same cause in all the schools. No one has been able
to establish links between the affected schools in any one state, let
alone across states. [The link could well have been the Internet -- has
anyone checked the chat groups during that period? There was also
extensive TV coverage of the outbreaks. - Mod.JW]
The agents of contagion may just have been the shared suspicion that
people around were falling victim to some sort of noxious substance
and the powerful sympathetic reaction to seeing other people scratch.
The skin is notoriously reactive to stress -- many people flush when
they are nervous; hives and eczema are triggered or worsened by
tension. Scratching begets more scratching, as anyone who has ever
tried to stop worrying an insect bite knows. Alfred DeMaria, an
epidemiologist with the state of Massachusetts, adds -- and nearly every
other health official I spoke with agreed -- itching, like yawning, is a
very suggestible symptom.
Wll-documented outbreaks of mass psychogenic illness do occur.
Between 1973 and 1993, there were 70 reports of mass hysteria in
medical journals; most took place in self-contained communities, like
schools, barracks and factories.
Symptoms spread by ''line of sight'' -- people get sick as they see other
people getting sick -- which is quite different from what happens with
a viral illness. Adolescents and preadolescents are particularly
susceptible, and girls are more likely to fall ill than boys. Girls'
heightened susceptibility to mass psychogenic illness need not be seen
as due to their more ''hysterical'' nature, but of their propensity to talk
among themselves about their health. Additionally, women are more
likely to seek medical attention, and presumably therefore to take note
of their own symptoms, than men.
There are several documented cases of rash as a psychogenic symptom.
In 1982, for example, 57 children at a West Virginia elementary school
experienced an outbreak of sudden itching. The rash showed up at 9:15
in the morning, when 2 fourth-graders began complaining of itchiness;
by noon, 32 students had the same symptoms.

[This New York Times article is an excellent review of the multistate/
province outbreak seen in schoolchildren over the past 8 months, with
significant background on the field of epidemic hysteria. (It is well
worth reading in full. - Mod.JW). This outbreak was reported in the
MMWR (1) with mention of an investigation still pending. To date
follow-up information on the results of the investigations has not been
published in the MMWR. ProMED-mail would appreciate further
information on the studies conducted and results/conclusions on the
part of the investigators. For interested readers, a selected bibliography
on epidemic hysteria is included below. - Mod.MPP]
