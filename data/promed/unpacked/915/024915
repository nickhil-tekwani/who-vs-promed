Lane County Public Health officials announced Monday [4 Jun 2007] they have
confirmed a 2nd case of measles in Eugene [Oregon, USA]. A 21 year old
Eugene man was treated at Sacred Heart Medical Center on 26 May 2007 with a
fever and rash after he returned from a trip to Japan. He was diagnosed
with measles.
After he arrived in Eugene on 22 May 2007, he socialized with another
Eugene man, also in his early 20s, public health officials said. The 2nd
man became infected on 28 May 2007. "They partied together the night the
1st young man arrived here from Japan," said Dr. Sarah Hendrickson with
Lane County Public Health.
Betsy Meredith, a Lane County Public Health nursing supervisor, said she
fears more people will come down with measles. "It is officially an
outbreak, because there has been transmission to at least one other
person," Meredith said. "It's indicative there has probably been
transmission to other people."
Local health authorities have been working around the clock to contact
hundreds of people who may have come into contact with the 2 men, Meredith
said. Although nurses told the 2nd man to stay at home because he could
spread the disease, he went to public places, Hendrickson said. Officials
said the man went to:
WOW Hall, last Tuesday, Brother Ali concert, 10 pm;
Jameson's Bar, last Wednesday, from midnight to 2 am;
Sushi Station, last Wednesday, between 6 and 7 pm.
"If you were at those places, please call us," Hendrickson said. "You have
been exposed to measles, and we need to know if you can get measles."
Lane County Public Health can be reached at (541) 682-4041. Those who have
been vaccinated and those who were born before 1957 are immune to measles,
Meredith said. Oregon law requires children to be vaccinated against
measles, and most children get shots by the time they're at least one year
old, Meredith said. Parents can decline for their children to be vaccinated
for religious reasons.
About 4 per cent of Lane County schoolchildren do not receive the
vaccination, Meredith said. Those who have serious diseases such as cancer
might not be able to handle the vaccine.
Officials said college students should check their immunization records
again just to be sure. University Health Center Director Tom Ryan said
roughly 400 students don't have the vaccine. He said students can check
their records at the health center. "There shouldn't be many who don't have
the vaccine, but if anyone is questioning if they're up to date, we can
certainly check for them," Ryan said.
Hendrickson said those who are infected should stay at home for at least 3
weeks after exposure. "Otherwise, these people are likely -- just as the
2nd case -- to expose a greater number of our friends and neighbors and
fellow citizens in this county to this disease," Hendrickson said. Lane
County Public Health officials said they are unsure how much the cases will
cost the department. Employees have been contacting citizens they think may
have been in contact with the 2 men.
Officials said the man who was 1st diagnosed with measles may have exposed
people at:
United Flight 6406 from San Francisco to Eugene, 22 May 2007
Shoji's Restaurant, between 5 pm and 6 pm, 22 May 2007
Safeway, 145 E 18th Avenue, in the floral department and the checkout area,
between 6 pm and 7 pm, 22 May 2007
Sundance Natural Food Store, between 6:35 pm and 6:50 pm, 27 May 2007.

[The ongoing outbreak of measles in Japan has been covered in prior
ProMED-mail posts (references below) and has been associated with
documented measles in Japanese tourists visiting Canada (see Measles -
Canada ex Japan: susp. 20070601.1766). According to the data available on
the Infectious Disease Surveillance Center of the Japanese National
Institute of Health, the weekly reports of measles cases have been
increasing with a significant rise in cases seen in weeks 19 through 21 (7
through 27 May 2007. The aforementioned graph of reported cases is
available at: <http://idsc.nih.go.jp/idwr/kanja/weeklygraph/12measles-e.html>).
Since the Americas region has made great progress towards the goal of
interruption of indigenous transmission of measles virus, importation of
measles cases remains the primary route of introduction of measles into the
region. Beginning in 2003, all reported outbreaks of measles in the
Americas have been importation related, including a major outbreak in
Mexico that began in 2003 and continued through 2004 (see
<http://www.ops-oms.org/English/ad/fch/im/Measles_NumberCases.pdf>). (The
major outbreak of measles in Venezuela in 2006 that has continued into 2007
was an importation related outbreak
<http://www.paho.org/English/DD/PIN/pr060327.htm>). According to the Pan
American Health Organization Measles and Rubella Bulletin, as of week 21 in
the Americas region there have been a total of 43 cases of measles
confirmed in the Americas region
(<http://www.paho.org/English/AD/FCH/IM/sme1321.pdf>). Of these 43 cases,
23 were in Venezuela, 7 were in Canada and 13 were in the USA. Of the cases
where information on origin of the case was known, in the USA, 8 were
classified as imported cases and 4 were classified as importation related
cases; of the Canadian cases 4 were classified as imported cases and 2 were
classified as unknown origin. Given the high amount of travel between Japan
and the Americas region, one would not be surprised to learn of other
instances of importations of measles into countries in the region now that
the summer travel season is beginning. - Mod.MPP]
