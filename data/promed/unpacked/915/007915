The Somalia Ministry of Health reported 913 new suspected cases of cholera, including 10 deaths and a case-fatality rate of 1.1 percent during the past week [6 to 12 Feb 2017]. This brings the total since the beginning of 2017 to 4026 cumulative suspected cases of cholera including 57 deaths (case-fatality rate 1.5 percent). There has been a decrease in fatalities compared to last week (case-fatality rate 1.7 percent) indicating an improvement in patient care and overall response activities in the country.

The cholera outbreak in Somalia has affected in 38 districts in 8 regions and is spreading to new villages and districts. Most of the affected districts are along the Shebelle River where the waters have dried up. The ongoing drought, subsequent water shortage and malnutrition have led to the spread of the outbreak.

Due to the prolonged conflict in the country, insecurity and accessibility are among the hindrances to cholera response operations.

[2] Cholera - South Sudan
Date: Tue 14 Feb 2017

A shortage of boats, which is a prime transport source in the region, and fuel scarcity are worsening the deadly cholera outbreak that has claimed 14 lives in crisis-torn South Sudan. The disease has spread dramatically in the Eastern Lakes state.

Health minister, Achol Marial, conceded government faced numerous challenges in addressing the outbreak, citing the presence of 1 motorboat, which is unable to cover all 28 highlands. "Lack of fuel is also affecting the motorboat operation," added Marial.

Disease outbreaks in the world's newest country have coincided with a civil war that has paralyzed the country since independence in 2011. The cholera outbreak in 2016 caused more cases and spread to more locations than in 2015.

At least 37 people died of cholera in Eastern Lakes and other 13 cases were recorded in Jonglei State, local officials announced on [Mon 13 Feb 2017]. Tong Koyom, Yirol County Commissioner in Eastern Lakes State, told Radio Tamazuj that a medical team from the state ministry of health reported that at least 37 people died of cholera in 3 counties along the River Nile.

"There are no signs of cholera cases in my county, but there are 3 areas along the River Nile where 37 people died due to cholera disease according to the state ministry of health. The areas include Adior, Shambe, and even Minkaman of Awerial County," said Tong.

Koryom pointed out that the state ministry of health had dispatched a medical team to those areas in order to carry out a campaign against cholera. For his part, Achol Marial, Minister of Information in Eastern Lakes State, confirmed that at least 14 people died of suspected cases of cholera near the River Nile last week.

Elsewhere in Jonglei State, Minister of Health in Jonglei, Dr Angok Gordon, confirmed that cholera cases were reported in swampy areas near the River Nile in greater Bor counties. However, the local official did not give more details about the matter. Meanwhile, Dr Kwai Deng Kwai, Director General at Jonglei's Ministry of Health, said they have recorded about 13 cases of cholera in the state. He further said 1 case of cholera was recorded at Panyagor Hospital and that other 12 cases are being treated at Bor Hospital. "Previously, we had more than 12 cases at Bor Hospital, but we discharged some of them in the past few days," said Kwai.

Dr Kwai explained that the 1st cases of cholera were recorded in Jalle Payam in January 2017, but the other cases were reported later in Jarweng area and Duk County.

[5] Probable cholera, fatalities - Philippines (Davao del Norte)
Date: Tue 14 Feb 2017
Source: Davao Today [edited]
http://davaotoday.com/main/human-rights/cholera-like-bacteria-found-in-ip-community-in-talaingod/


A team of biologists from the University of the Philippines [UP] conducted a fecalysis last week [week of 6 Feb 2017] in Talaingod, Davao del Norte, and found a cholera-like bacterium which was blamed to be the culprit of an outbreak that claimed lives of several Lumad [indigenous people, IP] last December 2016.

According to Dr Ruth Gamboa, Biology professor from UP Mindanao, their finding was not "conclusive" but pointed out the symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea of the disease that hit the IP community were similar to that of cholera. "The symptoms were like cholera, but it is still not conclusive for we still need additional laboratory tests," she said. The team's initial findings, Gamboa said, specifically named a water parasite to be the cause of the disease. "Initially, the parasite from their water is normal."

Gamboa added that since 2014, a total of 10 Lumad -- 2 adults and 8 children -- died due to the outbreak when they returned to their community after spending more than a year of refuge in Davao city. In sum, the outbreak already claimed 28 lives since December 2016. Of the 28, 18 were children. Those who died were several Lumad who stayed at the United Church of Christ of the Philippines -- Haran Compound.

"The water here [Davao] is chlorinated, the water in Talaingod is fresh from the spring," Gamboa said referring to what the Lumad told them about the comparison of the water from 2 different sources.
