Strawberries likely cause behind German mass food poisoning
-------------------------------------------------------------------
More than 11,000 German schoolchildren fell ill due to a deadly food poisoning outbreak, but the cause of the same was not known. It is now suspected that strawberries were the probable cause of the mass food poisoning, which led children to suffer from diarrhea and vomiting.

The news was given by the Robert Koch Institute, which has told the German authorities that they have found a link between the occurrence of the outbreak and frozen batch of strawberries.

Holger Eichele, spokesman for the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection, was delighted to inform that they have been able to solve one of the biggest hurdles in the case. "We have made a big step forward in the investigations", he further asserted.

Though majority of the patients have witnessed minor symptoms of food poisoning, like vomiting, still there are 32 people, who have suffering from serious consequences of the food poisoning and are being hospitalized.

The caterer, who supplied the food to schools and kindergarten, has announced that they will be paying the compensations to parents. Further investigations in the matter are going on and is expected that authorities concerned will soon be able to reach at a conclusion.

[This was most likely due to norovirus. Norovirus is a very contagious virus. Norovirus infection can be contracted from an infected person, contaminated food or water, or by touching contaminated surfaces. The most common symptoms of norovirus infection are diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea and/or stomach pan. Norovirus outbreaks occur throughout the year. But, over 80 percent of the outbreaks occur from November to April. Most outbreaks are caused when norovirus is spread from infected people to others. But, the virus can also spread by consuming contaminated food or water and touching things that have the virus on them. People can get norovirus illness many times during their lifetime, and outbreaks can affect people of all ages and in a variety of settings.
