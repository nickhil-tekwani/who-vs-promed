China has discovered a new H5N1 bird flu case in poultry in the
western Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the Ministry of Agriculture
(MOA) said on Wednesday [7 Jun 2006].
The case was identified after domestic poultry at a farm in
Xinjiang's Hetian County died of an unclear illness. [see map of
Hetian/Hotan at
<http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2003-04/03/content_815413.htm>].
The dead poultry were confirmed to have been infected with the bird
flu virus on Wednesday after testing at the national bird flu laboratory.
The MOA has sent expert teams to Hetian to control any possible outbreak.
An emergency mechanism has been launched and the local veterinary
departments have set up examination stations to disinfect people and
vehicles into and out of the affected area.

[2] China, control

Having learned a bitter lesson from covering up the severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in early 2003, the central
government of China now is said to be taking a more positive,
responsible attitude in dealing with avian influenza, or bird flu.
But that hasn't filtered down to the provinces.
As the market economy has taken root in China, the country has become
increasingly decentralized. Because of this, Beijing's tough orders
regarding the prevention of a bird-flu outbreak may not necessarily
be carried out at all levels. Overwhelmingly concerned with economic
growth, some local officials still tend to cover up any outbreak of
bird flu, defying Beijing's order to report new cases immediately.
Beijing has punished some local officials for their incompetence in
dealing with bird-flu outbreaks. For instance, in May it was
announced that 5 officials in Dazhu county in Sichuan province had
been sacked for of dereliction of duty because they did not report
and contain the local outbreak in time.
But during an investigative reporting trip to 3 locations in China
[Yangzhou, Chuzhou and Chenzhou], Asia Times Online found that in
rural areas, local officials and residents really don't like any
action that might expose a possible bird-flu outbreak, fearing the
damage it would do to the economy. Because of this, they hate
individuals who dare to inform authorities of any bird-flu case.
Qiao Songju, a resident of Gaoyou county in Jiangsu province,
attained a brief heroic reputation for informing authorities of a
massive bird-flu outbreak in Anhui province in October 2005. Tipped
by Qiao, the Ministry of Agriculture confirmed the outbreak of the
deadly H5N1 bird flu among geese and chicken in Liangying village of
Chuzhou city.
Qiao gained overnight fame as the first informer of a bird-flu
outbreak. But his joy did not last long. One month later, Gaoyou
police paid a midnight visit to Qiao's home and "invited" him to the
station for a "chat", which turned out to be the prologue to
detention. The next day, Qiao was arrested on suspected fraud and
blackmail activities. His arrest happened 2 days after he attempted
to report another bird flu outbreak -- this time in his own hometown.
His arrest made headlines.
Observers pointed out that the timing of Qiao's arrest suggested it
was hardly coincidental. Many believed he was being framed. The
Guangzhou-based and often outspoken South Metropolis News pointed out
Qiao's arrest took place when he was preparing to expose the bird flu
outbreak in Gaoyou.
Qiao was tried on 21 and 26 Apr 2006. The court has yet to hand down
a verdict. In China, it is rare for such a case to be tried twice
without a court ruling. Analysts said it was likely that the central
government intervened, so the case now seems to be moving to Qiao's advantage.
Near the Jiangsu provincial capital Nanjing, Gaoyou abounds in geese
and ducks. Poultry and eggs provide almost the entire gross domestic
product (GDP) to Gaoyou. For the locals, an outbreak of bird flu
there could mean the end of the world.
To the local farmers, Qiao was just a "bad guy". Because of his
tip-off, the government decided to destroy all reared poultry in the
neighborhood, but the state compensation did not suffice to cover the
colossal loss.

The latest site with the lethal H5N1 bird flu in Romania was
confirmed to be just 40 km away from the northern Bulgarian border,
in Gurgevo province.[Probably Bulgarian for the Romanian province
Giurgiu; see map at
<http://www.aboutromania.com/maps3.html> - Mod.AS]
A statement posted on a municipal website denounces earlier refusals
on the availability of the lethal virus in the area.
The site with detected infection is near the village of Balbukata,
and Romanian authorities are affirming it has been disinfected. The
settlement is under quarantine and some 800 birds were culled,
Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) informed.
