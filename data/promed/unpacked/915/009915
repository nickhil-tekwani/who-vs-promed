The Iraqi ministries of health and agriculture have decided to take measures to prevent the entry of any birds or poultry coming from the Kurdistan region. The Director of the Veterinary Laboratories in the Ministry of Agriculture, Bassim Najm Al-Adhadh, said in a statement yesterday [2 Feb 2016] that "there are no positive cases of avian influenza in the Kurdistan region, except for the only case in Dohuk poultry project and all the birds in that project, totaling 700 000 chickens, were killed."

An expert from the Ministry of Health, Kareem Abd Kadhim, said in a statement yesterday [2 Feb 2016] that "the Ministry of Agriculture has informed us that there are a number of bird flu cases in the north. Then the Higher Committee for Avian Influenza, with instructions from the Minister of Health, Adila Hamoud, and in cooperation with the other ministries, has taken the required preventive measures."

The Veterinary Department in the Ministry of Health announced that all the Iraqi governorates (except the Kurdistan region) are free of avian influenza. The department said in a statement yesterday [2 Feb 2016] that "after investigation and laboratory tests, it has been confirmed that except for the Kurdistan region, all the other Iraqi governorates are free of the avian influenza outbreak."

[The report above confirms that the outbreak of avian influenza was only recorded in a poultry project in Dohuk governorate, where 700 000 chickens were killed as a precautionary measure.

Previous reports have indicated that outbreaks of avian influenza were also recorded in Sulaymaniyah and Al-Qadisiyyah governorates. The outbreak of Al-Qadisiyyah governorate was said to be related to poultry coming from the Kurdistan region. However, according to the report above, the Veterinary Department has refuted the occurrence of any outbreak in the Iraqi governorates, other than that of Dohuk. The report does not refer to the claimed outbreak in Al-Qadisiyyah governorate.

Any additional information about the occurrence of an outbreak in Al-Qadisiyyah governorate would be highly appreciated. - Mod.NS]

[It may be assumed that this report refers to HPAI H5N1; confirmation or otherwise will be appreciated. - Mod.AS
