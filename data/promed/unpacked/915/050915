As a general matter in international health law and international human
rights law, there is no recognized specific human right to disseminate
public health information nationally or to the rest of the world.
Dissemination of public health information falls under established areas of
human rights law such as free speech. As a historical matter, WHO has
proved uninterested in human rights issues, and only really woke up to
their public health importance during the AIDS pandemic. The new Health
for All policy recently adopted by the World Health Assembly stresses the
importance of human rights in public health policies, which is a positive
development for WHO.
Now, virtually all the major international human rights treaties allow
freedom of speech to be restricted for public health reasons (as well as
other compelling public interests). (Let's assume, for analytical
purposes, that Castro thinks arresting and imprisoning Mendoza is necessary
for public health reasons -- to ensure accurate dissemination of public
health information.) It is widely recognized that to justify a restriction
on the freedom of speech, the restriction must (1) be prescribed by law,
(2) be applied in a nondiscriminatory manner, (3) relate to a compelling
public interest, and (4) be necessary to achieve the compelling public
interest, meaning that the restriction has to be proportional to the
interest sought to be protected, *and* be the least restrictive measure
possible to achieve the public interest in question.
One might argue in favor of the restriction that trade and tourist
industries can be hurt very badly if a private physician circulates
misleading or false public health information internationally. But this
argument only works with misleading or false information, not with true
information.
The historical reluctance of governments to report public health
information (which is one of the reasons the International Health
Regulations have not worked well) creates the potential for government
repression of efforts to disseminate public health information through
non-official channels.
While the Mendoza case raises important public health concerns, it also
intersects more standard international human rights discourses. As the
involvement of Amnesty International and Physicians for Human Rights in the
Mendoza case suggests, the Castro government's actions against him can be
faulted for violating recognized norms of international human rights law --
such as the right of free speech. But Castro's government has never
recognized a right of free speech.
The machinery for enforcing international human rights law is notoriously
weak. In addition, the enforcement machinery is treaty based, and Cuba is
unlikely to have joined many international human rights treaties.
This is an issue for the World Health Assembly to address, and WHO as a
whole. But I think that the best strategy is a two-pronged assault from
the international human rights angle and the public health angle. Amnesty
International and other human rights NGOs have already become involved, but
the Mendoza case should also be brought before the Inter-American
Commission on Human Rights, which has cited Castro's government for
violating human rights in the past.
In addition, WHO needs to challenge Castro formally and publicly on this
issue. The fact that it just awarded Castro a Gold Medal for Health for
All in May 1998 does not bode well for WHO taking action on this issue, or
for its handling of human rights in general.
