Deadly virus suspected of killing fish
-------------------------------------------
A deadly virus is suspected of killing a number of fish in the lake at Brocket Hall.

Shocked, a local person contacted the Welwyn Hatfield Times after his walk in the grounds of the Lemsford stately home on 1 Jun 2012 ended in upset, as he discovered "no less than 10 dead carp" floating lifeless among the lilies. The fish were sizable, at about a foot long each.

He said he had to avert his young daughter's gaze from the scene on the lake. He said: "I was shocked. My 3-year-old girl kept asking what those things in the water were. My wife and I had to divert her attention."

He added: "Not sure what could have caused such an event, but I know the River Lea feeds the lake, the staff had just been called to see them [the dead fish] by one of the members, so I suspect they must be recently dead."

It was revealed that staff at the site are dealing with a suspected outbreak of virulent koi herpes.

Kurt Schmid, general manager of Brocket Hall, said: "We are aware of the suspected case of Koi Herpes Virus (KHV) within the lake on the estate. "As this is a naturally occurring environmental circumstance, we are working with the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS) and the Environment Agency to confirm this.

"We are keeping in regular contact with CEFAS to stay informed of this situation and will assist in any way possible to resolve it."

[Koi herpesvirus disease (KHVD) is caused by a herpesvirus capable of inducing a contagious and acute viraemia in common carp (_Cyprinus carpio_) including carp ornamental varieties such as koi carp and ghost carp.

The disease is transmitted by fish to fish contact and it is also possible that the disease can spread through contaminated water, nets and other equipment. The virus is thought to be shed through faeces, and urine, and also possibly via gills and skin. KHVD may have the capacity to remain latent in its host for long periods of time before becoming active; stress is often the 'trigger' before an outbreak of the disease.

The disease was added to the OIE list in 2007.

PCR testing of archived samples in the UK confirmed that KHVD had been present there as early as 1996 (Denham, K. 2003. Koi herpesvirus in wild fish. Veterinary Record 153:507)

More information on KHVD is found in OIE Aquatic Manual chapter 2.3.6, which is available at:
