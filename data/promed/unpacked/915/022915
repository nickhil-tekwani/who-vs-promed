USDA Imposes Import Restrictions Due to BSE in Japan
------------------------
WASHINGTON, 18 Sep 2001--The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced today
that it has imposed import restrictions on Japanese ruminants and ruminant
products due to a suspected case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
These restrictions apply to prohibited product arriving in ports on or
after 10 Sep 2001.
Japan reported the suspected case of BSE to the Office International des
Epizooties (OIE), a world organization for animal health, on 10 Sep 2001.
The disease is suspected in a 5-year-old Holstein cow kept on a dairy farm
in the Chiba prefecture. Initial tests have provided some positive results.
The Japanese authorities have submitted samples to international reference
laboratories for confirmatory testing.
USDA has restricted the importation of live ruminants and ruminant products
from Japan since March of 2000 due to foot-and-mouth disease.
No case of BSE has ever been diagnosed in the United States. This action is
necessary in order to continue to safeguard American agriculture against
this deadly neurological disease of bovine animals.
USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, in cooperation with
USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service and other federal agencies, has
taken aggressive measures in BSE surveillance, prevention, education, and
preparation for response. Since 1989, APHIS has prohibited the importation
of live ruminants from all countries where BSE is known to exist in native
cattle. Other products derived from ruminants also are restricted entry
into the United States except under special conditions or under permit for
scientific or research purposes.

Since February of 2000, Japan has not been eligible to import any raw meat
products to the U.S. because of FMD. Recently, APHIS was considering
issuing a proposed rule notice to lift this ban, since it appeared that the
FMD outbreak was resolved.
In light of the current BSE issue however, all meat from ruminant animals
is ineligible for export to the U.S. It is possible that APHIS would go
forward with their proposed rule and allow meat from swine to be eligible
for import into the U.S. In [that event, pork from Japan [would become
eligible for import into the U.S. This action would not impact our overall
meat imports because historically Kobe beef is the principle meat product
from Japan.

restrictions was kindly provided by Karen Morris and Paul Resweber of USDA.
