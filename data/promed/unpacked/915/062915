culture belonged to serogroup A. The International Coordinating
Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control has
provided 1 800 000 doses of bivalent AC vaccine. The vaccination campaigns
in the affected districts are currently being implemented with the support
of WHO and partners, including the European Commission Humanitarian Aid

State. Following laboratory confirmation of _N. meningitidis_ serogroup
W135 in 2 specimens of cerebrospinal fluid, the ICG has provided 102 375
doses of trivalent ACW vaccine. A mass vaccination campaign will be
implemented this week by the Federal Ministry of Health, with support from
Medecins sans Frontieres, UNICEF and WHO.

A national task force under the chairmanship of the Federal Ministry of
Health together with WHO, UNICEF and NGOs has been established after
reports of outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis in the country.
As of 16 Mar 2006, 526 cases with 23 deaths (case fatality rate of 4.37
percent) have been reported across the country. The epidemic thresholds in
4 States (Blue Nile, Gedaref, Kassala and South Kordofan) have, so far,
been crossed. Cultures conducted at NAMRU-3, a WHO collaborating centre in
Cairo, have isolated the _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A as the
causative strain for the outbreak of meningococcal meningitis. Mass
vaccination campaigns with bivalent vaccines (A/C) are continuing in South
Kordofan as well as in Gedaref State. 2 vaccination campaigns have already
been completed in the Blue Nile and in Kassala States.
Another outbreak of meningococcal meningitis disease caused by _Neisseria
meningitidis_ serogroup W135 has been confirmed (by laboratory culture) in
the Hamadyia IDP camp in Zalingei in West Darfur and as of 10 Mar 2006, 28
cases of meningococcal meningitis disease and 1 death (case fatality rate
of 3.57 percent) have been reported to WHO through the Early Warning and
Alert Response Surveillance (EWARS) system of Darfur.
The national task force is coordinating the public health response to the
outbreak and WHO requested trivalent vaccines (ACW) from the Internal
Coordination Group (ICG) for the outbreak in Darfur. The request was
approved and the vaccines have arrived in Khartoum. The vaccination
campaign is expected to start later this week.
WHO Sudan is providing technical guidance for outbreak control and case
management of the disease in addition to drugs and other emergency supplies
for outbreak investigation.

A vaccination campaign against meningitis will start this week in western
Sudan following the confirmation of an outbreak in Hamadyia camp for
internally displaced persons in Zalinger, West Darfur, said the WHO on Sun,
19 Mar 2006.
Some 28 cases of meningitis and one death had been reported through an
early-warning system by 10 Mar 2006, WHO said in a statement. The disease
had also been reported in other regions of Sudan. As of 16 March, 526 cases
with 23 deaths had been reported countrywide, including in Blue Nile,
Gedaref, Kassala and South Kordofan States.
Mass vaccination campaigns were going on in South Kordofan and Gedaref
while 2 campaigns had been completed in Blue Nile and Kassala.
A task force chaired by the Sudanese health ministry, together with WHO,
the UN Children's Agency (UNICEF) and nongovernmental organisations is
coordinating the response to the outbreak.
In Feb 2006, WHO reported more than 100 cases of suspected meningitis,
including 15 fatalities, in 6 Sudanese states, including Khartoum, Blue
Nile, Kassala, Sennar, West Darfur and Gedaref.
Sudan is considered part of the "African meningitis belt", a group of
countries particularly vulnerable to the disease. In 2005, 3703 people were
infected in 14 Sudanese states, of whom 124 died.

Meningococcal meningitis has claimed 34 lives while 486 people have
reportedly been affected by the killer disease in the last 3 months in the
city, a senior Delhi government health official said on Tue, 21 Mar 2006.
"So far 34 people have died of symptoms similar to those of meningitis, of
which 18 cases have been confirmed," said NK Yadav, deputy municipal health
officer of Delhi.
"One person succumbed to the disease on Mon, 20 Mar 2006, and the patient
was a confirmed case," Yadav said without giving details of deaths.
"The disease has not taken the form of an epidemic and people should not
panic," Yadav said. However, he said the administration was not complacent
about the situation. "All necessary steps are being taken to curb the
disease from taking the shape of an epidemic."
Meningitis cases were reported in March 2006 from all the leading hospitals
in the capital including All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS),
Ram Manohar Lohia, Loknayak Jaiprakash, Safdarjung and Bara Hindu Rao.
From the areas under the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), the central
zone has reported 25 confirmed cases followed by Sadar Paharganj with 24
cases, Civil Lines with 20 cases and Karol Bagh with 15 cases.
Officials said the families of the patients were being advised to take
precautionary measures and antibiotics were being distributed to check the
spread of the disease.
The last major outbreak of meningitis in India was in 1985 when 6000 cases
and 800 deaths were reported across the country. In 2005, over 50 people
had succumbed to the killer brain fever.
Officials said steps were being taken to make the public aware about the
disease through hoardings [notices placed on fences?], posters and leaflets.
