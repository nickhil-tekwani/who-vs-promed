Accepted for publication 9 Jan 2004.
Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV), family Closteroviridae and
Sweet potato feathery mottle virus (SPFMV), family Potyviridae) are
whitefly- and aphid-transmitted, respectively, which in double infections
cause sweet potato virus disease (SPVD), a serious sweet potato (_Ipomoea
batatas_ Lam.) disease in Africa (2). During the past decade, sweet potato
plants showing symptoms similar to SPVD have been observed in most areas of
Spain. Nevertheless, not much information is available about the identity
of the viruses infecting this crop in Spain.
During the summer of 2002, sweet potato plants with foliar mosaic,
stunting, leaf malformation, chlorosis, and ringspot symptoms were observed
in several farms in Malaga (southern Spain) and Tenerife and Lanzarote
(Canary Islands, Spain). Vine cuttings were collected from 21 symptomatic
plants in Malaga and from 8 plants on Lanzarote and 6 on Tenerife. Scions
were grafted to the indicator hosts, Brazilian morning glory (_I. setosa_)
and _I. nil_ cv. Scarlett O'Hara. 3 weeks after graft inoculations, all
plants showed various degrees of mosaic, chlorosis, leaf malformation, and
stunting.
4 field collections (2 from Malaga, one from Tenerife, and one from
Lanzarote) with severe symptoms on _I. setosa_ were selected for whitefly
(_Bemisia tabaci_ biotype Q) transmission experiments. Acquisition and
transmission periods were 48 h. _I. setosa_ was the acquisition host, and
_I. nil_ was the transmission host. For each isolate, groups of 10
whiteflies per _I. nil_ plant were used.
All _I. nil_ plants used as transmission hosts with the 4 field collections
showed chlorosis and leaf malformation. Reverse-transcription polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on _I. setosa_ (grafted with the 4
selected field collections) and _I. nil_ plants (from the
whitefly transmission experiments) with primers for the HSP70h gene of
SPCSV. A 450-bp DNA fragment was obtained with all _I. setosa_ and _I. nil_
samples.
Sequencing of the 450-bp DNA from 2 samples from Malaga yielded a
nucleotide sequence with 98 to 99 percent similarity to the HSP70h gene of
West African SPCSV isolates. Foliar samples from _I. setosa_, originally
grafted with the 21 vine cuttings, were used for nitrocellulose membrane
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (NCM-ELISA) testing with antiserum
specific to SPFMV-RC (provided by J. Moyer, North Carolina State
University, Raleigh). Positive control was sap extract from _I. setosa_
that was infected with the common strain of SPFMV. Procedures for
NCM-ELISA-ELISA were as described (4).
NCM-ELISA testing suggested that SPFMV was present in all samples. RT-PCR
was conducted with degenerate primers POT1/POT2 (1). The nucleotide
sequence that was amplified by these 2 primers spans part of the Nlb
protein and part of the coat protein gene of potyviruses.
All samples yielded the expected 1.3-kb DNA. Sequencing of the RT-PCR
products of 2 isolates from Malaga and sequence comparisons yielded
nucleotide sequences with 97 percent similarity to 2 East African isolates
(Nam 1 and Nam 3) of SPFMV (3).
These results confirm the presence of SPCSV and SPFMV in sweet potato in Spain.

[SPVD is considered the most damaging virus disease of sweet potato in
Africa and may be the most serious disease in the crop worldwide. SPFMV is
ubiquitous, whereas SPCSV has been reported only from Africa (Nigeria,
Uganda, Kenya, Zaire), Asia (Taiwan, China, Indonesia, Philippines),
America (USA, Brazil, Argentina, Peru) and Israel. The fact that both
viruses are present in Spain indicates that SPVD can be expected to spread
in the country.
Virus research at the International Potato Center in Peru is focused on
SPVD because of its debilitating effect on resource-poor farms, especially
in sub-Saharan Africa. Unfortunately, SPFMV-resistant cultivars originating
from CIP were found to be susceptible to SPVD. Identification of genes for
resistance to both SPCSV and SPFMV is a high priority. In China, using
healthy planting materials resulted in yields that were 2-3 times greater
than SPVD-infected plants. Similar results were obtained in African trials.
