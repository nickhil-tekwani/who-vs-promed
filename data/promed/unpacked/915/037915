_Plasmodium ovale wallikeri_ in Western Lowland Gorillas and Humans, Central African Republic
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Human malaria parasites have rarely been reported from free-ranging great apes. Our study confirms the presence of the human malaria parasite _Plasmodium ovale wallikeri_ in western lowland gorillas and humans in Dzanga Sangha Protected Areas, Central African Republic, and discusses implications for malaria epidemiology.

The role of human malaria parasites in free-ranging great apes remains unclear. Several _Plasmodium_ species have been documented in gorillas, including _P. praefalciparum_, _P. adleri_, and _P. blacklocki_. The finding of _Plasmodium ovale wallikeri_ increases that list.
In this study, they report asymptomatic infections in humans and gorillas in Dzanga Sangha Protected areas. Molecular studies showed that the genetic identity of human and gorilla isolates was identical, indicating potential human-ape transmission.
This finding is of relevance to public health and gorilla conservation. Wild great apes may serve as sentinels of infectious diseases. Using the information that can be provided by feces is an excellent non-invasive tool to monitor their health.
