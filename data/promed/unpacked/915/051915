El Paso County Public Health officials Friday [26 Jun 2015] confirmed the area's 1st case of the plague this year [2015], saying a mule deer found on 19 Jun 2015 tested positive for the disease.

Officials are cautioning residents in the Pleasant Valley neighborhood, on Colorado Springs' west side, to take precautions. Notification of the positive test came Friday [26 Jun 2015].

The El Paso County case comes on the heels of at least 2 other incidents of plague in recent days; a 16-year-old high school baseball player from Poudre High School died on 8 Jun 2015 after contracting a rare strain of the disease. Also on Friday [26 Jun 2015], a parking area in Lakewood's Bear Creek Lake Park was shut down by plague connected to a prairie dog colony.

Plague is a bacterial disease transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected flea, or by handling an infected animal. Taking steps to avoid flea exposure will help prevent spread of the disease.

In humans, the symptoms of plague infection are high fever, chills, headache, extreme fatigue and tender or swollen lymph glands. If you experience these symptoms, contact your physician.

Plague is endemic in El Paso County, and precautions to prevent plague should always be taken. El Paso County's last reported human case occurred in 1991; officials said they will monitor plague activity in the neighborhood and respond as appropriate.

A parking area in Lakewood's Bear Creek Lake Park has been shut down by plague connected to a prairie dog colony. The unpaved, overflow parking lot at the park, 15 600 W. Morrison Road, has been closed the past week, according to a Lakewood media release.

Jefferson County Public Health confirmed the presence of plague in the popular park. Crews have dusted prairie dog holes in the area to kill fleas, which carry and transmit the plague, the release said.

The city is not aware of any humans who have contracted the plague from the park's prairie dog colonies.

Park visitors are urged to follow posted directions and closures, and to keep dogs on a leash and away from marked areas.

[Plague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic among rodents in the western United States. Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.

Plague is a potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections are rare but can be life-threatening. The case fatality rate of plague depends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic) and timing of initiation of antibiotic therapy; if untreated, the case fatality rate is over 50 per cent for bubonic plague and approaches 100 per cent for pneumonic plague. Rapid laboratory identification can help guide therapy.

Domestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners. Cats may serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea treatments and repellents appropriate for pets available. Some products may be suitable for dogs but not cats, or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and puppies, even resulting in fatalities.

Clinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities.

Veterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one palpating the swelling.

Another form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire this form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the respiratory infection.

You should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into your home via a pet vehicle can also transmit disease to you, the owner, or caretaker of the pet. Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in enzootic areas. Plague patients with no history of exposure to rodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected rodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea control to dog and cat owners.

Although plague is relatively rare in wild ungulates, this report (J Wildl Dis. 2008 Oct;44(4):983-7. Ocular plague (_Yersinia pestis_) in mule deer (_Odocoileus hemionus_) from Wyoming and Oregon. Edmunds DR1, Williams ES, O'Toole D, Mills KW, Boerger-Fields AM, Jaeger PT, Bildfell RJ, Dearing P, Cornish TE) describes ocular lesions associated with _Yersinia pestis_ infection in 3 free-ranging mule deer (_Odocoileus hemionus_) from Wyoming and Oregon, USA. All deer were observed antemortem and seemed to be blind. Post-mortem examination revealed gross lesions of bilateral keratoconjunctivitis and/or panophthalmitis in the 1st 2 deer, but only partial retinal detachment in the 3rd deer. Microscopically, all deer had moderate-to-severe necrotizing and fibrinopurulent endophthalmitis and varying degrees of keratoconjunctivitis with abundant intralesional coccobacilli. The lesions in the 1st (D1) and 3rd deer (D3) suggested an acute course, whereas those in the 2nd deer (D2) were subacute to chronic. _Yersinia pestis_ was isolated from ocular tissue swabs or ocular fluids of D1 and D2, and it was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry within ocular lesions of D1 and D3. Although plague does not seem to be a major cause of morbidity or mortality in free-ranging mule deer, keratoconjunctivitis or pinkeye is relatively common in these animals, and plague should be considered as a differential diagnosis in such cases, with appropriate precautions taken to protect human and animal health.
