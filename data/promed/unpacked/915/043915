Corn disease spreads to crop in north Louisiana
-----------------------------------------------
The LSU [Louisiana State University] AgCenter says a bacterial infection of corn has been confirmed in 4 northeast Louisiana parishes. That represents the farthest south that Goss's wilt has been found. And while it hasn't shown up in Mississippi and Arkansas, experts there say it's sure to happen.

AgCenter's Clayton Hollier says the discovery is surprising because Louisiana is a long way from the corn belt. He says that since 18 Jun [2013], the bacterium has been found in Louisiana's Madison, Tensas, East, and West Carroll parishes.

He says farmers whose corn has been infected should bury stalks and leaves left in their field to cut chances of a wider outbreak next year [2014]. He says planting a different crop could help, too.

[Goss's wilt (GW) and blight of maize is caused by the bacterium _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _nebraskensis_. It is a persistent and economically serious disease of susceptible maize hybrids in several states of the USA. In 2009, it was reported for the 1st time outside the US, from Canada (ProMED-mail post 20100820.2901).

The bacterium can also affect some grasses, which may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Symptoms may include systemic wilting of plants, leaf lesions, blighting and leaf necrosis, reduction of ear size, or even death of plants. Infection of leaves, stems, and roots occurs primarily through wounds (mechanical, hail, or insect damage), and plants are susceptible at all growth stages. The pathogen is seed transmitted and overwinters on crop debris and maize kernels. Disease management includes cultural practices to minimise inoculum, crop rotation, and use of resistant crop varieties.

A rapid spread of Goss's wilt in recent years (see map below) is causing concern in the US. The reasons for the increased rate of spread are still unknown, but the possibility of an emerging new strain is being considered (ProMED-mail post 20110921.2865). GW was suspected in Louisiana earlier in the cropping season (ProMED-mail post 20130709.1814416), and the report above now confirms a new southernmost distribution boundary for the disease.
