FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM / GREAT BRITAIN
(Date of last previously reported outbreak: 1981).
Emergency report
Summary of 2 faxes received on 21 and 22 Feb 2001 from Dr J.M. Scudamore,
Chief Veterinary Officer, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, London:
Report date: 22 Feb 2001.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, post-mortem and laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 19 Feb 2001.
Estimated date of first infection: 16 Feb 2001.
Date of confirmation of diagnosis: 20 Feb 2001.
Outbreaks
Location No. of outbreaks
County of Essex 3
Description of affected population:
- Outbreak No. 2001/01: clinical signs in 27 sows and 1 boar in the lairage
of an abattoir near Brentwood, Essex;
- Outbreak No. 2001/02: clinical signs in 1 bull on an 18- to 24-month-old
fattening cattle farm in the neighbourhood (1 mile) of outbreak 2001/01;
- Outbreak No. 2001/03: clinical signs in 6 cattle in a beef suckler herd
located 1 km from outbreak 2001/01.
Total number of animals in the outbreaks:
species susceptible cases deaths destroyed slaughtered
bov 231 7 0 231 0
sui 346 28 0 346 0
Diagnosis: suspicion of disease was first reported in pigs in the abattoir
(outbreak 2001/01) on 19 February 2001 and tissue samples from affected
animals were submitted to laboratory the same day.
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: Institute for Animal Health,
Pirbright, Surrey (OIE World Reference Laboratory (WRL) for foot and mouth
disease).
B. Diagnostic tests used: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), virus
typing.
C. Causal agent: FMD virus serotype O, "Pan Asian" strain.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: the origin of the virus is unknown.
B. Mode of spread: the first and the third outbreaks have direct links in
that some of the cattle on the farm (outbreak 2001/03) belong to the owner
of the abattoir (outbreak 2001/01).
C. Other epidemiological details: epidemiological investigations are under
way to identify the source of the outbreaks and to trace any animals which
may have been in contact with the affected livestock.
Control measures: in accordance with the measures foreseen in European
Council Directive 85/511/EEC:
- Stamping-out policy: all animals in outbreaks 2001/01 and 2001/02 have
been destroyed. In outbreak 2001/03 the 6 affected cattle are being killed
on the farm on 22 Feb 2001 and the remainder will be killed on 23 Feb 2001,
and arrangements are being made to dispose of the carcasses by incineration
on the farm.
- Protection and surveillance zones with a minimum radius of 3 km and 10 km
have been established around the outbreaks.

[The most important piece of information here is that the source is unknown.
Combine that fact with today's other reports indicating dispersion of the
virus outside of the zone described in this OIE report and I begin to get a
very queasy feeling in my stomach. There is a chance that this outbreak may
spin out of control and the opportunity to "stamp out" the outbreak may be
lost. Everyone should remember how quickly FMD moves through populations.
And if the Scottish case is confirmed, we have the virus from North to the
South.
I would urge everyone involved in animal health to loudly proclaim the need
for the highest levels of cooperation from farmers and the general public.
Furthermore, countries which normally have contact with UK livestock should
be vigilant. It wouldn't even hurt for the United States to increase our
surveillance given that this outbreak represents yet another FMD incursion
into virgin territory. Please see comments from FAO's Yves Cheneau in
today's posting Foot & mouth disease - UK (05) concerning the pandemic
nature of this FMD virus. - Mod.PC
