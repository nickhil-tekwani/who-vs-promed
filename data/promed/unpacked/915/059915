African swine fever virus detected in [Orenburg] province
--------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of African swine fever [ASF] was reported in
Chernorechie, Orenburg province (the Urals), reported to RIA Novosti
by a spokesperson of the Regional Bureau of Emergency Situations.

In total, 40 pigs were killed by it in the village. Following
[laboratory] analyses, it was officially confirmed as African swine
fever.

African swine fever, or Montgomery's disease, was reported for the
1st time in Africa in 1903. It is transmitted to healthy animals
following contact with sick animals, as well as through contaminated
feed, transportation, and secretions. It does not affect humans, but
it is very dangerous for pigs. There is no vaccine against this
disease, hence infected animals must be destroyed immediately.

[For the location of Chernorechie (Chernorech'ye) in the
Orenburgskaya Oblast, just north of Kazakhstan, see maps at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/RS/55/Chernorechenskoye.html>
&
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/russiaaddivisions.jpg>.
North Ossetia is area 6 and Chechnya area 8 on this map.

ASF has been spreading in the Caucasus area since mid 2007. If the
information above is officially confirmed, this means a leap of the
virus of more than 1200 km (750 mi) in the northeastern direction,
measured from its most northern reported current location, Chechnya.
Such a leap could take place either by (illegal?) movements of
infected animals or their products, or by the undetectable (or
unreported) spread of the ASF virus within the wild swine population
throughout territories northwest of the Caspian Sea, such as
Stavropol, Dagestan, Kalmykia, Astrakhan, and northeast to Kazakhstan.
Enhanced surveillance in those areas deserves to be encouraged.

Readers are referred to FAO/EMPRES (Food and Agriculture
Organisation/Emergency Prevention System) review "African swine fever
in the Caucasus" at
<http://www.fao.org/docs/eims/upload//242232/EW_caucasus_apr08.pdf>,
which includes, among others, the map (fig 2) "Swine density in
Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and the Middle East." Based upon the
discussed data, the authors concluded that the main risk of ASF
spread is to the north and east.

Official confirmation -- or otherwise -- of the current information,
is anticipated. - Mod.AS]
