The CDC reports there have now been 65 cases of Powassan virus [infections] confirmed in the US, with 5 cases in Massachusetts that have all occurred within the past 2 years. A recent study by a group of Connecticut researchers found a higher number of ticks following winters with heavy snow cover, said Rick Ostfeld, an ecologist who has been studying ticks for 2 decades at the Cary Institute for Ecosystem Studies of Millbrook, New York. "We know snow insulates," he said, "So it makes sense that it would be protective for ticks."

Precautions that minimize risk include limiting skin exposure, utilizing store bought insect repellents, and avoiding areas where tick and mosquito infestations most frequently occur. Richard Pollack, PhD, Public Health Entomologist at the Harvard School of Public Health, says "Time is of the essence" in preventing tick attachment and disease risk.

"A daily check can prevent this, so everyone in the family should be like little chimpanzees and look for them," he said. Chemical pesticides are commonly used for mosquito and tick control but there are risks to people and pets associated with the active ingredients in these products as well as the unwanted consequence of killing of non-target beneficial insects. Some of these insects help control garden pests, many are pollinators, and some, such as the dragonfly and damselfly, actually help control mosquito populations. Chemical pesticides also leave behind residue and sprays can drift off target creating a significant risk of coming into contact with non-target organisms such as children and pets.

An effective alternative is organic IC3 pest control, which is not persistent in the environment and is completely non-toxic to people and pets. It utilizes naturally occurring essential plant oils and has proven efficacy against target pests, reducing their threat by as much as 92 percent, with no adverse effects on humans, the environment, or non-target insects and wildlife. This type of treatment is a preferred method at EHS, a company focused on eco-sensitive pest solutions.

[Although the number of cases of Powassan virus infections so far in 2015 is not given in the report above, the precautions given are worth considering as with spring temperature increases in the north central and north eastern states in the USA and the southeastern Canadian provinces, the risk of exposure to Powassan viruses increases. These areas have had heavy snow cover during the winter just ended, further increasing vector tick survival and the risk of Powassan virus infection. Avoidance of tick bites is the only preventive measure that can be taken.

Mod.CP noted, "According to the ICTV (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses), Powassan virus (POWV) is a member of the genus _Flavivirus_. Specifically, it belongs to the mammalian group of tick-borne flaviviruses and is closely related to Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus. Human cases of POWV infections have been recognized in the United States, Canada, and Russia. In the United States, cases of POWV disease have been reported primarily from northeastern states and the Great Lakes region." (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20131226.2137895).
