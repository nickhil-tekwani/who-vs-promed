NIH Scientists Advance Universal Flu Vaccine
---------------------------------------------
A universal influenza vaccine -- so-called because it could
potentially provide protection from all flu strains for decades --
may become a reality because of research led by scientists from the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part
of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). In experiments with mice,
ferrets and monkeys, the investigators used a 2-step immunization
approach to elicit infection-fighting antibodies that attacked a
diverse array of influenza virus strains. Current flu vaccines do not
generate such broadly neutralizing antibodies, so they must be
re-formulated annually to match the predominant virus strains
circulating each year. (The research, led by NIAID scientist Gary J.
Nabel, M.D., Ph.D., appears online ahead of print 15 Jul 2010 in
Science Express.)

"Generating broadly neutralizing antibodies to multiple strains of
influenza in animals through vaccination is an important milestone in
the quest for a universal influenza vaccine," says NIAID Director
Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. "This significant advance lays the groundwork
for the development of a vaccine to provide long-lasting protection
against any strain of influenza. A durable and effective universal
influenza vaccine would have enormous ramifications for the control
of influenza, a disease that claims an estimated 250 000 to 500 000
lives annually, including an average of 36 000 in the United States."

In parallel experiments with mice, ferrets and monkeys, Dr. Nabel and
his colleagues 1st primed the animals' immune systems with a vaccine
made from DNA encoding the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) surface
protein. After being primed with DNA vaccine, the mice and ferrets
received a booster dose of the 2006-2007 seasonal influenza vaccine
or a vaccine made from a weakened cold virus (an adenovirus)
containing HA flu protein. Monkeys were boosted with the seasonal flu
vaccine only.

This prime-boost vaccine stimulated an immune response to the stem of
the lollipop-shaped hemagglutinin of influenza virus. Unlike HA's
head -- which mutates readily, allowing the virus to become
unrecognizable to antibodies -- the stem varies relatively little
from strain to strain. In principle, Dr. Nabel explains, antibodies
generated against the stem of HA should be able to recognize and
neutralize multiple flu strains.

Although the DNA in the priming vaccine was derived from a 1999
circulating flu virus, all the animals made antibodies capable of
neutralizing virus strains from several other years. Mice and ferrets
produced antibodies not only against virus strains dating from before
1999, including a strain that emerged in 1934, but also against
strains that emerged in 2006 and 2007.

Moreover, although the prime-boost vaccines were both made from H1
subtypes of influenza A virus, the antibodies they generated
neutralized other influenza subtypes, including H5N1 (avian
influenza) virus. This indicates that a prime-boost strategy
potentially could confer immunity to many or all subtypes of
influenza A, says Dr. Nabel.

In another set of experiments, the scientists measured how well the
prime-boost vaccine protected mice and ferrets from infection with
deadly levels of flu virus. Three weeks after receiving the boost, 20
mice were exposed to high levels of 1934 flu virus, and 80 percent
survived. Mice receiving DNA only, seasonal flu vaccine only or a
sham prime-boost vaccine all died.

The researchers saw similar results when they tested several
prime-boost combinations in ferrets, which are considered a good
animal model for predicting flu vaccine efficacy in humans. All 4
ferrets that received a DNA prime-seasonal boost were protected from
infection with a 2007 virus strain, while all 6 ferrets that received
the DNA prime-cold virus boost combination were protected from the
1934 influenza virus. Collaborators on these studies included
Terrence Tumpey, Ph.D., of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

"We are excited by these results," says Dr. Nabel. "The prime-boost
approach opens a new door to vaccinations for influenza that would be
similar to vaccination against such diseases as hepatitis, where we
vaccinate early in life and then boost immunity through occasional,
additional inoculations in adulthood."

Trials of prime-boost influenza vaccines assessing safety and ability
of the vaccine to generate immune responses are already under way in
humans, Dr. Nabel adds. The information from the new research will be
valuable in selecting candidates to move forward into large-scale
trials, he says. "We may be able to begin efficacy trials of a
broadly protective flu vaccine in 3 to 5 years."

The authors' abstract reads: "The rapid dissemination of the 2009
pandemic influenza virus underscores the need for universal influenza
vaccines that elicit protective immunity to diverse viral strains.
Here, we show that vaccination with plasmid DNA encoding H1N1
influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and boosting with seasonal vaccine or
replication-defective adenovirus 5 (rAd5) vector encoding HA
stimulated the production of broadly neutralizing influenza antibodies.

"This prime-boost combination increased neutralization of diverse
H1N1 strains from 1934 to 2007 compared to either component alone and
conferred protection against divergent H1N1 viruses in mice and
ferrets. These antibodies were directed to the conserved stem region
of HA and were also elicited in nonhuman primates.
Cross-neutralization of H1N1 subtypes elicited by this approach
provides a basis for development of a universalinfluenza vaccine for humans."

ProMED-mail does not routinely report information on vaccine
development, but the work described above has far reaching
consequences for control of influenza virus infection in humans and
animals, and for the elimination of influenza pandemics. Also the
successful application of a plasmid-based DNA vaccine has great
significance for vaccine development in general. - Mod.CP]
