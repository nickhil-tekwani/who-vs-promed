Six more people on Monday morning [3 Feb 2020] were treated and discharged following a suspected anthrax outbreak in Emityot village in Sotik, Bomet. Health executive member Joseph Sitonik said all the individuals exhibited cutaneous signs where watery wounds appeared on parts of their bodies. Sitonik said they were out of danger.

Those referred on Sunday [2 Feb 2020], he added, were also attended to and discharged. No patient is admitted to any health facility as a result of anthrax, Sitonik said. "We treated and released them after they tested positive for the disease, but we would also like to state that there are no patients admitted to hospitals since their conditions are not severe," Sitonik told journalists in his office.

The number of those who came in contact with the carcasses of the animals was 29: 4 [children] under 5 years old, 17 male adults, and 8 women. Sitonik said the number of animals that died were 7.

While calling on residents from the area to visit the nearest health facilities for a check-up, the CEC said the disease had adverse effects on humans, saying it can cause severe pneumonia.

[The previous report had 18 villagers affected and treated. With these additional 6 over the weekend, the total is now 24 people with cutaneous lesions. Whether these 24 were all included in the 29 carcass handlers is unclear, though not impossible. How the 4 children under 5 years of age came to be exposed is not described, but it could well have been through playing and coming in contact with a butchered carcass. There would have been ample spilt blood. And we now have 7 dead cattle in this village. - Mod.MHJ
