In the 1990's, the New World screwworm was detected and later eradicated in Libya.

At that time, a powder containing insecticides and antibiotics was put in the wound. The wound was covered. The treatment was successful. Personally, I also used a normal spray insecticide, once, and later local antibiotic cream (stocklon tar is the best to avoid further infestation).

For wildlife pour-on treatment, there is a machine called Scorpion that dispenses a pour-on preparation onto the animals. The machine delivers the right quantity of the product. It is sited in front of a food station so that the animal has to pass underneath the arm of the machine delivering the pour-on.

[There may be a similar instrument in the USA having a different name, but delivery systems through which an animal must pass while someone wipes them on the back or sides are common. - Mod.TG
