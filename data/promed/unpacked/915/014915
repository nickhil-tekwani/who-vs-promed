[1] Oilseed rape: phoma, light leaf spot

The 1st signs of phoma infections are appearing in oilseed rape crops
slightly later than usual this autumn [2009] across the country as a
whole. However, backward crops, particularly in the East, will be
more at risk from the disease. And bad weather during harvest in the
North means the predicted onset of phoma into crops is earlier this
year, says Dr Neal Evans, plant pathologist at Rothamsted Research.

"As you come further south into Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire
growers will be seeing 10 percent phoma leaf spotting now in their
crops, which follows a similar pattern to last year [2008]," he says.

Preliminary predictions for light leaf spot show increased levels in
crops compared with forecasts for 2008/09 in the North, East
Midlands, and West, however crops in the South West may get less
disease than last season. "Inoculum has been building up generally
over the past few seasons because of wet weather, and there is more
light leaf spot out there as a result," says Dr Evans.

"Light leaf spot is very crop specific and you can get high
infestation on one farm and no sign of it in the next. It's very
affected by, and dependent upon, rain and with the increasing pattern
of localised downpours that we seem to be getting, it can be a very
specific problem." Crops should be sprayed for light leaf spot when
25 percent of plants are affected.

[2] Maize: eyespot

For those who have already harvested their maize, Simon Pope, of
Wynnstay, is recommending they bury stubble soon to reduce eyespot
infections in next year's [2010] maize crop. Incidences of infection
in this year's maize crop are less widespread than at first feared,
says Dr Pope, but where disease took hold, yield losses of up to 80
percent were reported.

"Eyespot has been a significant problem for growers in the south west
of England but it is slowly spreading across southern England and
into South Wales," he says. "Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire have
become real hotspots for the disease with growers reporting
significant yield losses. Cold, wet seasons provide ideal conditions
for the spread of the disease." Dr Pope recommends considering this
when selecting varieties.

[Light leaf spot (LLS) of _Brassica_ species is caused by the fungus
_Pyrenopeziza brassicae_. Leaves become infected soon after sowing,
but remain symptomless until lesions appear on older leaves.
Developing pods are often infected, leading to premature ripening of
seed and pod shatter. LLS is polycyclic and survives the summer on
crop debris, volunteer oilseed rape, and vegetable brassicas. Disease
management includes varieties with decreased levels of
susceptibility, disease monitoring, and timely fungicide
applications. In the UK, LLS has caused considerable yield losses of
oilseed rape in the past and was reported in 2009 to be at its
highest level since the epidemic of 1995 (ProMED-mail post 20090226.0795).

Phoma leaf spot and stem canker (blackleg) is caused by the fungus
_Leptosphaeria maculans_. It is considered the most serious disease
of oilseed rape with a possible yield loss of 50 percent or more. It
can also affect other _Brassica_ hosts such as cabbage and turnip.
Symptoms on rape may include lesions on leaves, stems, and pods, with
stem cankers leading to premature ripening or collapse of the crop.
However, symptomless infections may also occur. The fungus is
seed-borne and is also spread by wind, splash dispersal, and infected
crop litter. It may overwinter in stubble, which is therefore often
sprayed with fungicides. Disease management includes use of clean
seed, cultural practices to minimise inoculum, fungicides, and
planting of resistant cultivars. The pathogen is extremely diverse
with new strains evolving frequently some of which have overcome
major resistance genes within certain varieties in the past.

Eyespot of maize is caused by the fungus _Kabatiella zeae_. Leaf
symptoms include lesions with a light coloured centre and a brown
margin ('eyespots'). Symptoms may include early drying out of the
leaves, shrivelling of the ears, and even kernel infections. Eyespot
can lead to considerable yield reduction and also predisposes the
host to stalk rots. Host susceptibility is highest during cold rainy
seasons. The fungus is specific to maize and can overwinter in plant
debris. Spores are dispersed by rain and wind, and the disease may be
carried over in stubbles from the previous years maize crop. Disease
management includes deep ploughing (to encourage decomposition of
crop debris), crop rotation, and fungicide treatments. Hybrid maize
lines with reduced susceptibility are available.
