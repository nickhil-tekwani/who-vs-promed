Two new cases of meningitis were recorded last week [week of 12 May 2014] in Tinghir, [Souss Massa Draa region]. The 2 patients are students at the Assou Oubassalam school. According to a statement from the Department of Health, local health authorities promptly took the necessary measures under the meningitis control program. Both children were transferred to the regional hospital in Ouarzazate [Souss Massa Draa region]. Their families have also been tested and received preventive care, and an epidemiological investigation has been carried out in the affected children's and neighboring douars [an Arabian village consisting typically of a group of tents or huts that encircle an open space]. Similarly, all students, teachers, and school staff have been tested, which revealed 2 new cases among the students. Nearly 800 persons were vaccinated against meningitis and for added efficiency, the health minister, Hussein Al Ouardi, sent a specialized team of the Epidemiology and Infectious Diseases directorate to the site, to carry out an epidemiological investigation and take, if necessary, additional measures.

To date, the 4 students who remain hospitalized are doing well. Finally, the Department of Health wishes to clarify that these are isolated cases, which are controlled.

[Large epidemics of meningococcal meningitis recur each year during the hot, dry season, between December and June in the semi-arid areas of sub-Saharan Africa, designated the WHO African meningitis belt, which extends from Ethiopia in the East, to Senegal in the West and includes Senegal, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Mali, Cote d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, Central African Republic, Sudan, South Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Eritrea (see map at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/content/yellowbook/2014/map_3-11.pdf). Serogroup A meningococcus has been the main cause of epidemic meningococcal disease in this region (http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/meningitis/whoemcbac983.pdf). However, since the introduction of the meningococcal A conjugate vaccine in countries of the African meningitis belt in 2010, the WHO noted a decrease in the number of cases of meningitis; in fact, the number of cases in 2013 was the lowest recorded during the epidemic season in the last 10 years (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_06_06_menin/en/). In addition, _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A was noted to be no longer the predominant pathogen.

We are not told the microbial etiology of the meningitis outbreak in Morocco and Morocco is not part of the African meningitis belt, but the occurrence of serogroup A meningococcus outbreaks in Morocco in 1987 and 1989 may have been provoked by the introduction of a virulent strain of serogroup A meningococcus imported by returning pilgrims. ProMED-mail would appreciate more information on this current outbreak in Morocco from knowledgeable sources.

Tinghir, with a population of 36 000 according to the 2004 census, is a city in central Morocco (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinghir). It can be located via the HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=2484797,39182. Tinghir and Ouarzazate are provinces in the Souss-Massa-Draa Region of Morocco, one of the 16 regions of Morocco (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souss-Massa-Dr√¢a). - Mod.ML]
