As I understand it (from reading a report in USA Today) that in addition to
the basil problem there has been an outbreak of Cyclosporiasis that appears
to be related to salad greens. I believe that it will become important to
note the origin of vegetables to be consumed raw so that the necessary
precautions may be taken, when there is the possibility that they have been
"fertilized" with either human or untreated animal waste. [Certainly,
coccidiosis is a huge problem worldwide in many animal species but have we
yet established any link between animal and humans infections with
cyclosporidia?- Mod pc]. I believe that there is a need for the food
industry to become cognisant of the problem. Will treatment with organic
chlorine tablets or other such "disinfectants" eliminate Cyclosporidia?
[There is some concern that chlorine may not do the job but we may need
something soon.- Mod pc]
