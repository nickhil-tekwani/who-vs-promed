The catastrophic decline of wild sea trout in northwest Scotland is largely
due to commercial salmon farming, say government scientists. The
researchers have found that sea lice, which have long infested caged
salmon, have now spread to sea trout, weakening and killing them.
The accusation is the most serious ever leveled at salmon farmers, who have
been criticised before for polluting lochs and damaging wildlife.
Both the number and weight of sea trout caught in northwest Scotland have
dropped dramatically over the past nine years. According to the Freshwater
Fisheries Laboratory in Pitlochry, annual catches by rod and line between
1989 and 1995 were only 29 per cent of those between 1952 and 1988. The
average weight of each fish caught declined from 820 grams in 1988 to 540
grams in 1993.
Now scientists from the Pitlochry laboratory and the Marine Laboratory in
Aberdeen, who advise the Scottish Office, have concluded that lice from
farmed salmon are "a major contributory factor" in the collapse.
"It's as plain as the nose on your face," one senior government scientist,
who wished to remain anonymous, told "New Scientist".
Other factors have been blamed, although none is as clear cut as sea lice.
Climate change may have been responsible for a gradual decline in the fish
throughout Europe since the 1960s, but the scientists say it cannot be
blamed for the sudden collapse of the population in northwest Scotland
since 1989. They have also ruled out overfishing, pollution, changes in
land use and droughts as major causes.
The latest evidence, which is due to be published next year, comes partly
from a genetic study by researchers at the University of St Andrews in
Fife. By differentiating between the DNA of farm and wild lice, they have
demonstrated for the first time that lice found on sea trout came from
farmed salmon.
Surveys by the Pitlochry laboratory found that sea trout from the northwest
coast were infested with four times as many lice as trout from the east
coast, where there are no salmon farms. Young sea trout spend long periods
in sea lochs near fish farms before they migrate out to sea, where
Pitlochry scientists believe they are dying in increasing numbers.
The evidence that lice from salmon are causing the decline in sea trout is
overwhelming, scientists argue. "We should act on the assumption that there
is a link," says the senior government scientist.
But the Scottish Office continues to insist that lice are not the root
cause of the decline in sea trout. "It is a combination of causes including
climate change, afforestation and acidification," says a spokeswoman.
Strangely, the fish-farming industry seems more willing to accept that
there is a problem. Lord Lindsay, chairman of the Scottish Salmon Growers'
Association, says the industry is introducing a new policy to control lice.
"I really think that lice will be confined to history in a matter of
years," he predicts.
