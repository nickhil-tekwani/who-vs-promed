Rift Valley fever has spread to Western Cape [province], with a
veterinarian presumably infected and 14 animals dead, the provincial
Departments of Agriculture and Health said on Monday [29 Mar 2010].
The man presumably got infected while conducting post-mortem
examinations on 2 dead cows, Department of Health spokeswoman Helene
Rossouw said in a statement.

Department of agriculture spokesman Wouter Kriel said the 2 Jersey
cattle died near the border of the Northern and Western Cape. 12
Merino lambs died on a farm east of Beaufort West.

"Their post mortem findings were typical for Rift Valley fever.
Samples from both these cases were found positive for Rift Valley
fever virus by the Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute on Friday [26
Mar 2010]."

Rossouw said the vet's symptoms included fever, severe headache,
muscle aches and extreme eye pain with sensitivity to light. Blood
samples had been taken to verify the cause of these symptoms. The man
was under medical supervision at home, and his condition was stable.

A total of 63 people had been confirmed infected countrywide so far.
According to the national Health Department, out of the 63, 54 cases
and 2 deaths were from the Free State. There were 4 cases in the
Eastern Cape and 5 cases in the Northern Cape.

Kriel advised sheep and cattle farmers not to let their stock graze in
wet, low-lying areas with large mosquito populations. "The use of
insecticidal and insect repellent remedies might be considered for
valuable stock. As this is a viral disease, no specific treatment is
available." Kriel said his department had ordered a further 40 000
doses of live Rift Valley fever vaccine to be used in the next weeks.

In November last year [2009], 90 000 doses of vaccine were
administered by private veterinarians in the Swartland, West Coast and
Ceres areas.
