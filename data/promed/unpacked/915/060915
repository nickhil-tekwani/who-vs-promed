Russian rear services are helping Chechens from districts cleared
of Islamic guerrillas restore to civilian life, a spokesman for the
Armed Forces Rearguard said. Military veterinarians are
vaccinating animals there at the request of local residents. No
vaccination has been held there for many years, causing great
damage to the breakaway region's economy, Alexander Kolpakov
said. Many cattle have brucellosis, which is dangerous for people,
and veterinarians are explaining eating unprocessed meat and
drinking raw milk may cause epidemics.
