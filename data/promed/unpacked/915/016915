[In the absence of an immediate official report, ProMED-mail had to base its earlier reports on the described event upon Reuters' reports. This outbreak of a low-pathogenic H5N1 in the East German state of Brandenburg (see map at the source URL) was thus initially reported as suspected with request for information and later as refuted. The current OIE report provides the official, apparently correct information. Since the species in this and other OIE reports addressing poultry/avians is unspecified (are "birds" conceived, systematically, as 'species'?!), it will be helpful to obtain from the authorities/OIE information on the affected population (according to the Reuters reports, the outbreak occurred on "a duck farm, which was carrying out its own tests").

We are grateful to Sabine Zentis for providing another, earlier source confirming the outbreak's diagnosis http://www.mugv.brandenburg.de/cms/detail.php/bb1.c.322948.de. - Mod.AS.
