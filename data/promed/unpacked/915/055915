A woman suspected of having [a] hantavirus infection, [who] was being
mechanically ventilated, has died in the Alemana Clinic. The infection
was acquired at Lago Colico in the Araucania region. The patient was a
27 year old woman, mother of 2 children, who worked as a paramedic in
the Alemana Clinic in Temuco.

Although [a] hantavirus infection still has not been confirmed by the
Public Health Institute, the 1st rapid test was positive, a fact
already communicated to the health SEREMI [Secretaria Regional
Ministerial de Salud; Regional Ministerial Secretariat] [official]
Gloria Rodriguez, who stated that they await confirmation of this
suspected case.

[The specific hantavirus involved with this suspected case of
hantavirus infection in Chile is not indicated, nor the environment
described in which the virus might have been acquired. The virus most
likely to be responsible for the case above is Andes virus, if
confirmed, with the long-tailed pygmy rice rat as its rodent host.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys
longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can
be seen at <http://www.bios.niu.edu/frayjorge/rod6.jpg>.
