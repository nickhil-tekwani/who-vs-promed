A confirmed case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has been recorded in a resident of the Proletarian District of the Rostov region. CCHF is characterized by severe intoxication, myalgia, fever up to 39-40 C [102-104 F] for 6-12 days. During the height of the infection, a hemorrhagic rash appears on the trunk and extremities accompanied by nasal, uterine, and intestinal haemorrhage. The vector is a tick, which remains infective throughout its life.

This year [2013] in the Rostov region, 403 people, including 124 children under the age of 14 years, sought treatment for tick bites. This is the highest number of recorded bites in the Rostov, Volgodonsk, Taganrog, Salsk Peschanokopsky, Semikarakorsky, Tselina, and Sal areas. According to epidemiologists, the majority of municipalities in the Rostov Region are located in areas that are natural foci of CCHF. Members of the Rostov Center for Hygiene and Epidemiology have isolated CCHF virus from ticks sampled in the Proletarian District. To protect against ticks, experts recommend marking locations in forests or parks where there are tick infestations, and visitors should wear appropriate protective clothing and use acaricides [tick pesticides] or repellents.

The 1st case of the disease this year was recorded in a village in the Cross Kotel'nikovskii area. The disease is transmitted by ticks. So far this year, 226 people, including 83 children in the Volgograd region, have sought treatment for tick bites. The disease appeared 1st in 2000. Since that time, 109 people have been affected, and 9 have died. In contrast, no cases of CCHF were recorded in the Volgograd Region last year [2012].

[These reports are indicative of the early presence of CCHF virus-infected ticks in southern Russia and the prelude to what may be serious outbreaks of CCHF disease in these regions.
