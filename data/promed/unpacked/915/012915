The [Hong Kong] Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today [5 Oct 2016] reported that the local activity of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) and acute gastroenteritis (AGE) are increasing, and again urged the public and management of institutions to maintain strict personal and environmental hygiene.

"The latest surveillance data show that activity of both diseases is increasing and may further increase in the following weeks. Members of the public should heighten vigilance," a spokesman for the CHP said.

Hand-foot-mouth disease [HFMD]
------------------------------
The number of institutional HFMD outbreaks increased from 3 (affecting 18 persons) in the week ending 3 Sep to 24 (77 persons) last week [week of 26 Sep 2016].

As of [4 Oct 2016], 14 (42 persons) had been reported this week. In the past 4 weeks, kindergartens and child care centres reported most outbreaks (69 per cent), followed by primary schools (20 per cent).

"The usual summer peak of HFMD is from May to July, with a possible smaller peak from October to December. Last year [2015], the summer peak lasted longer than usual.

Schools, institutions, and play facilities should observe our guidelines and health advice against outbreaks to better protect young children who are more prone to infections," the spokesman added.

As for enterovirus (EV) 71 infection, as of [4 Oct 2016], 22 cases (including one with severe complications) had been recorded this year. Last year [2015], 56 cases including 6 with severe complications were filed. Regarding severe paediatric EV infection other than EV71 and poliovirus, 9 cases had been detected so far this year with 8 last year.

Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is caused by viruses that belong to the _Enterovirus_ genus, including polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses.

Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is one of a large family of viruses which multiply in the human gastrointestinal tract. EV71 infection can cause illness ranging from mild through to serious with life threatening complications. Outbreaks have been reported in Asia over many years.

Spread is from person to person through contamination of hands or objects (for example, toys) with infected faeces. The virus is then taken in by the mouth. Spread also occurs by contact with the saliva, nasal mucus or sputum (phlegm) of an infected person. In people with hand-foot-mouth disease, direct contact with fluid from blisters on the infected person can also spread the virus.

Signs and symptoms
------------------
EV71 is one of many possible viruses that cause hand-foot-mouth disease [HFMD]. Not all children with EV71 infections will have HFMD, [which often is] caused by other viruses.

The symptoms of hand-foot-mouth disease are: fever, rash, tiredness, loss of appetite, ulcers or blisters in the mouth, and on the hands and feet. Often there is a sore mouth for a few days before the ulcers or blisters appear and affected young children may refuse to eat or drink.

EV71 infection usually causes only a mild illness in adults and children. However children under 5 years old, especially those under 2 years, are at higher risk of developing a severe EV71 infection.
