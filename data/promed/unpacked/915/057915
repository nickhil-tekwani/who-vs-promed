In response to the posting on 7 imported cholera cases in Japan whose
disease onset was between 20 May and 28 June 2001, I investigated those
cases. One was diagnosed only by clinical findings, while the other 6 were
confirmed by isolation of _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 from stool samples. It
should be emphasized that all of the 7 cases were diagnosed at ordinary
medical facilities, not at quarantine stations.
Among the 7 reported cases, only one was asymptomatic and seemed to be a
traveling companion of a symptomatic patient. Three were suspected of
contracting the disease in Philippines and the other 3 in Taiwan, Indonesia
(Bali), and China, respectively, with one case in which the origin was not
clear. All of the 3 cases contracted in Philippines and the case from
Taiwan were El Tor Ogawa. The one contracted in Bali was Ogawa and that
from China was Inaba, but the biotypes were not described.
We are not very surprised to know that there were 7 cases of imported
cholera during that period. As of 12 Aug 2001, this year has yielded a
total of 28 cases of cholera notified in our country, about 85 per cent of
which were imported.
In response to the statement in reference (02) above that a health check is
"mandatory for all Japanese travellers returning from an "endemic" region.
The check consists of routine examination of stool specimens or rectal
swabs collected at airports..." I propose the following. Upon arrival in
Japan, travellers returning from cholera-endemic countries as defined by
the World Health Organization are asked to fill in a document about the
presence or absence of various symptoms, including diarrhea. A traveller
who reports diarrhea is subjected to bacteriologic examination using stool
or rectal swab. In contrast, asymptomatic travellers are not usually asked
to provide those samples solely because they have returned from endemic
areas. Only in rare instances of a significant outbreak, for example in a
big tour group, may asymptomatic travellers be asked to do so; however, of
course, this is not compulsory.

[We are very grateful to Dr Kimura for this information; there is nothing
better than getting the information direct from the clinic or laboratory
concerned. Neither Indonesia nor the Philippines has reported to WHO that
they have cholera. Travellers should not be deterred from visiting those
countries, but should take appropriate precautions. - Mod.JW
