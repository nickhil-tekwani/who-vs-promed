[2] Saudi Arabia, Hajj MERS free - media report

Health Minister Adel Fakeih has declared this year's [2014] Hajj epidemic-free, as he announced that 70 people who were considered as possibly having MERS have all tested negative for the coronavirus.

"I am pleased to announce the Hajj was free of all epidemic diseases," Fakeih told reporters in Mina, as pilgrims performed the last rituals of the Hajj and began leaving the holy sites.

About 2 million Muslims from 163 countries have performed Hajj this year [2014]. The Haj drew a cross-section of humanity, from presidents to commoners, including a wounded Syrian rebel war veteran.

The health ministry employed thousands of health workers to make sure pilgrims were protected from 2 deadly viruses, Ebola and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus.

Fakeih set up a "command and control" center to direct the Hajj health operation and required every pilgrim to complete a health screening questionnaire. Passengers were monitored by thermal cameras that detect high body temperature, and 15 isolation rooms were set up to hold any suspicious cases at the airport in the city of Jeddah [Was this screening performed on both entering as well as departing Haji's?].

Saudi Arabia is the country hardest hit by MERS, which has killed 322 people in the kingdom since it 1st appeared in September 2012. The health ministry on Sunday [5 Oct 2014] reported 2 more MERS deaths, one in Riyadh and another in the mountain city of Taif, 80 km east of Makkah.

Because of the Ebola epidemic that has killed more than 3000 people in West Africa, pilgrims from the hardest-hit countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone were not allowed to perform Hajj this year [2014].

The Saudi Red Crescent Authority also declared the emergency response plan for the Hajj season a success. Prince Faisal bin Abdullah, president of Saudi Red Crescent Authority, said emergency air and ground teams responded to about 15 000 cases in the holy cities of Makkah and Madinah. The Red Crescent employed some 3600 emergency personnel, including doctors, technicians and support services, with some 536 ambulance teams scattered in the holy sites.

[With today's (6 Oct 2014) newly reported case of MERS-CoV infection in Taif, it brings the number of cases confirmed in Taif since the beginning of September 2014 to 7 including 3 deaths (case fatality rate of 42.9 percent), and the total number of MERS-CoV infections reported by Saudi Arabia to 757 including 322 deaths (case fatality rate of 42.5 percent). Of the 7 cases in Taif, 2 were in healthcare workers, 2 had a history of animal exposure (one stated to have exposure to camels), in one no exposure was mentioned, and the newly reported case today (6 Oct 2014) still has exposure history pending. One wonders what is currently going on in Taif to explain the continued occurrence of MERS-CoV cases.

In the 2nd article, there is a discussion on the efforts made to conduct surveillance for possible MERS-CoV cases (and Ebola virus disease) among Haji's. This has clearly been a massive effort on the part of the Saudi MOH to prevent an outbreak associated with a mass gathering involving approximately 2 million people. While there is mention of airport questionnaires and fever screening of Hajj attendees (Haji's), it is not clear whether the screening process was conducted just upon entry or whether the same process is being repeated upon departure. As the incubation period for MERS-CoV clinical disease can be as long as 14 days after exposure, the global "sigh of relief" that there was no MERS-CoV transmission to Hajj attendees is still pending. Hopefully that will be the case.
