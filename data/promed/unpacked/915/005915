Houghton city [Houghton county] could be facing a distemper outbreak in the raccoon population. Canine distemper is [clinically] similar to rabies. The virus is not contagious to humans. It can spread through the air to skunks, foxes, wolves, and household pets.

Houghton city police have received around 30 calls recently of raccoons showing possible signs of distemper. "Their equilibrium is off, they fall down, and they act like they're not afraid of humans. You might think they look intoxicated. So, if you see any of those signs, call your local police department, call your vet clinic or you can call the DNR [Department of Natural Resources]," says Houghton city police officer Lieutenant Nicholas Roberts.

You can protect your pets by keeping them on a leash and up to date on all vaccines.

Houghton city police strongly urge everyone to stay away from animals showing signs of distemper.

[Canine distemper spilling over into raccoons is a function of relative population densities and thus probable contact. Such outbreaks in raccoons are not uncommon and effectively thin raccoon populations. When we had such an outbreak in Baton Rouge, Louisiana a few years ago it killed 80 percent of the urban raccoons. The real problem is that raccoon rabies can be mistaken for raccoon distemper. So if you see a sick raccoon, call animal control so that they can come out, collect it, and have it tested for rabies. - Mod.MHJ
