Pakistan's prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, received a postal package containing anthrax spores 4 months ago, his spokesman said Wednesday [1 Feb 2012], adding a new dimension to the security threats faced by the country's political and military leadership.

The package was intercepted by the prime minister's security staff in October 2011, according to the spokesman, Akram Shaheedi. The Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, a government laboratory, established that the suspicious white powder it contained was anthrax spores, he said. A criminal case was filed on Tuesday [31 Jan 2012], according to an Islamabad police officer, The Associated Press reported.

Government officials gave contradictory accounts of the identity of the sender, and they offered little sense of motive. While Islamist militants have repeatedly targeted senior government officials in suicide and bomb attacks, an assassination attempt using biological weapons would be an anomaly.

Mr. Shaheedi said that law enforcement authorities had identified the sender as an associate professor at Jamshoro University in the southern province of Sindh. But he could not say whether the professor, a Ms. Zulekha, had been arrested or detained.

A senior police officer in charge of presidential security, Hakim Khan, gave a different account. He denied any knowledge of the suspect Mr. Shaheedi named, but he confirmed that a police team had been sent to Jamshoro to investigate. The packet had been sent from a small post office on the Jamshoro University campus, he said.

Mr. Khan said the case had been registered under a provision of Pakistan's penal code that deals with the act of sending poison with the intention of causing harm.

In November 2001, suspicious letters containing anthrax spores were sent to 3 private businesses, including the country's largest Urdu-language daily, Jang, in the southern port city of Karachi. No motive was ever determined.

A university professor allegedly sent a packet containing anthrax to the Pakistani prime minister's office in October 2011, his [the prime minister's] spokesman said Wednesday [1 Feb 2012], raising new security concerns in a country battling Islamist extremists.

No one was made ill by the deadly spores in the package, which was sent by a female professor who was not otherwise identified, said Akram Shaheedi, a spokesman for Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani. He added that the motive was not clear.

Shaheedi said tests at laboratories run by Pakistan's Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in Islamabad confirmed the substance in the package was anthrax. [He] said the package was received in October 2011. He did not say why the case was publicized only now.

Islamabad police officer Hakim Khan said the prime minister's office informed the force of the incident a few days ago, and a criminal case was filed on Tuesday [31 Jan 2012], a formal step in a police investigation. He said no arrests had been made yet.

Al-Qaida and other Islamic militants have carried out scores of gun and bomb attacks against the Pakistani state and Western targets in recent years. But militants have not been known to send letters or packages containing toxic material.

U.S. officials have long expressed concerns that al-Qaida and affiliated groups would like to use chemical or biological agents in attacks.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/9054412/Anthrax-parcel-sent-to-home-of-Pakistans-prime-minister.html


Police in Pakistan on Wednesday [1 Feb 2012] revealed that a parcel containing deadly anthrax powder was sent to the official residence of the country's prime minister.

While it marks the 1st time criminals have used the biological agent in an attack on a government office, letters laced with anthrax spores were sent to a mass-market Urdu newspaper and to a computer company in Karachi soon after 9/11, at the same time as scares in the US.

"We have just received the lab reports confirming it was anthrax, but we cannot say more than that at the moment," said Hakim Khan, a police officer in the government and diplomatic area of the capital, where the prime minister, Yousuf Raza Gilani, has his official residence.

A spokesman for Mr Gilani said it had been delivered in October 2011, and police were notified this week after laboratory tests were completed. "We believe the culprit was a lady professor," said Akram Shaheedi, but he declined to speculate on a motive.

Pakistan has been gripped for months by speculation that the government could be toppled by the military or the courts, and the use of a biological agent will deepen concern about the country's fragility.

The wider use of anthrax would mark a worrying turn in Pakistan, a nuclear-armed country that is battling a home-grown insurgency and where al-Qaeda leaders have long sheltered. More than 30 000 civilians and security forces have been killed in political and religious violence since 2001, many in suicide attacks carried out by the Pakistan Taliban or its affiliates.

In November 2001, Pakistani police arrested 2 men suspected of sending a letter containing anthrax to Pakistan's largest newspaper, The Daily Jang.

At the time, detectives said they did not believe anyone in Pakistan had the capacity to manufacture the deadly biological agent.

[These 3 newspapers clearly have better sources in Islamabad than the previous confused wire-reports, but the part played by the academic poster, a Ms Zulekha, remains obscure as does any purpose for such a mailing.

The 2001 Pakistani anthrax letters were covered in 2 postings: 20011024.2622 and 20011104.2729. Although 2 individuals were arrested for the 2001 mailings, their objectives, if they were involved, were never revealed nor the nature of the spores. As the Telegraph journalist comments, the detectives did not believe that there was an in-country capacity to manufacture spores at that time. Without details of any court case and the nature of the spores, that question is still there, though it is not a complex procedure. But at this time, it seems from these 3 reports that informed opinion is that this 2012 event had a domestic agenda.
