[Brucellosis caused by _B. suis_ biovar 2 differs from infection caused by biovars 1 and 3 in its host range, its distribution, and in its pathology. In general, the geographical distribution of biovar 2 has historically been in a broad range between Scandinavia and the Balkans. The prevalence in wild boars appears to be high throughout continental Europe. In recent outbreaks in Europe, wild boars have been implicated as the source of transmission of biovar 2 to outdoor reared pigs; in rare cases, such as the one recently described in Belgium (see 20120520.1139015), other domestic animals, such as bovines, may become infected.

In addition to wild boars, the European hare (_Lepus capensis_) is also considered to be a reservoir for _B. suis_ biovar 2 and has been implicated as a possible source of transmission to domestic livestock. _Brucella suis_ biovar 2 causes miliary lesions, particularly in reproductive tissues, that often become purulent. To date, biovar 2 has rarely been reported as the cause of human brucellosis. However, biovar 2 infection has been reported in 2 immuno-compromised hunters who had been extensively exposed through gutting or skinning boars or hares.

The above information is mainly derived from chapter 2.8.5 of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals, where additional information can be found; available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.08.05_PORCINE_BRUC.pdf.

The above OIE notification includes an interactive map. The infected wild boars have been sampled near the border junction with Belgium and Germany, countries known to be infected with _B.suis_. - Mod.AS
