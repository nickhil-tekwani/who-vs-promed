The Office of the State Veterinarian announced today Delaware's 4th and 5th cases of West Nile virus (WNV) found in horses in 2018. Previously, 3 cases of WNV in horses were reported in 2018, 2 in August and one in September.

The 4th case of WNV confirmed in a Delaware horse occurred in a one-year-old Standardbred mare residing in Kent County. The horse received veterinary care for loss of control of limbs and buckling over in the front limbs, which began on 11 Oct 2018. Clinical signs progressed to inability to rise, muscle twitching, and stupor. The horse was euthanized on 15 Oct 2018 due to the severity of its illness. She had not been vaccinated for WNV. New Bolton Center Clinical Pathology Laboratory reported positive WNV results on 19 Oct 2018.

The 5th infected horse is a 6-year-old Belgian mare residing in Kent County, evaluated by a veterinarian for whole body stiffness, acting sore, and abnormal mentation consisting of aggression with a date of onset of 12 Oct 2018. Diagnostic specimens were submitted to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory, which confirmed the diagnosis on 23 Oct 2018. The mare had never been previously vaccinated against WNV. She was treated supportively and her condition was improving as of 18 Oct 2018.

WNV and eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) are diseases transmitted to horses via the bites of mosquitoes. Humans can also be infected with WNV and EEE, but transmission requires a mosquito bite, and the virus cannot be directly transmitted between horses, or between horses and people. Signs of infection in horses include fever (although not always with WNV), anorexia, head pressing, depression or personality change, wobbling or staggering, weakness, blindness, convulsions, muscle spasms in the head and neck, or hind-limb weakness. If owners notice any of these signs in their horses, they should contact their veterinarian immediately. In 2017, 2 cases of WNV were confirmed in Delaware.

The Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control's (DNREC) Mosquito Control Section has seen an increase of WNV found in wild birds and sentinel chickens this year [2018] throughout the state. There has been a total of 8 EEE-positive sentinel chickens, and WNV has been detected in 66 sentinel chickens and 37 wild birds. So far in Delaware in 2018, 8 cases of WNV have been found in humans.

Even though we are nearing the end of the mosquito season, the State Veterinarian urges horse owners to contact their veterinarians as soon as possible to have horses and other equines vaccinated against WNV and EEE. Neither disease has a specific drug treatment, and EEE infections in horses are fatal in 70% to 90% of cases, and WNV in 30% of cases.

Horse owners can take several additional steps in the barn and around the farm to help protect horses from mosquito bites. Horses should be kept inside during dawn and dusk, which are peak hours for mosquito activity. Topical insect repellents labeled for use on horses may be applied. The wind generated by fans installed in horse stalls can also help deter mosquitoes. Old tires and containers should be disposed of and standing water eliminated. Water troughs or buckets should be emptied, cleaned, and refilled every 2 to 3 days if possible to remove any mosquito eggs or larvae.

For more information about WNV or EEE:
- To report suspected cases of human WNV, call the DPH Office of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at 888-295-5196.
- Animal health questions should be directed to the Delaware Department of Agriculture at 800-282-8685 (Delaware only) or 302-698-4500. Ask for the Poultry and Animal Health Section.
- Questions about the state's mosquito control program or mosquito biology should be directed to the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control's Mosquito Control Section at 302-739-9917.

The positive West Nile virus (WNV) tests keep rolling in. Another 2 more Kentucky horses have been confirmed as WNV-positive, E.S. Rusty Ford, equine operations consultant for the Kentucky State Veterinarian's Office, said in a 30 Oct 2018 statement. There are now 16 confirmed cases of WNV in Kentucky horses this year [2018]. He said the University of Kentucky's Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, in Lexington, confirmed the diagnoses Tuesday [30 Oct 2018].

The 1st horse, a 5-year-old Tennessee Walking Horse mare from Rockcastle County, developed neurologic spasticity (contracted muscles) on 24 Oct 2018, Ford said. Her condition worsened, and she eventually went down. She was euthanized. Ford said the horse had no WNV vaccination history.

The 2nd horse, a 12-year-old Tennessee Walking Horse mare from Hardin County, developed acute ataxia (incoordination) and muscle fasciculation (involuntary twitching) on 25 Oct 2018, he said. "The attending veterinarian reported today (30 Oct 2018) the patient continues to improve and [is] expected to recover," Ford said. "It is understood the patient was partially vaccinated (with an initial single dose) reportedly given around 20 Jan 2018."

In 2017, there were 16 reported cases of WNV in Kentucky horses, he told The Horse.

https://www.wspa.com/news/bird-tests-positive-for-west-nile-in-union-co-spraying-schduled/1563339421


Pesticide spraying has been scheduled for part of Union County, South Carolina, after a bird tested positive for West Nile virus. Union County Emergency Management says the bird was found at a residence in the 4800 block of Jonesville-Lockhart Highway.

Officials plan to spray pesticides in the area early next week [5 Nov 2018]. Larvicide briquettes will also be placed in storm drains and ditches. The pesticide does not pose a health risk to humans or animals, but officials say beekeepers in the area should relocate or cover their hives until spraying has been completed.

Earlier this month, Union County officials said a person tested positive for the West Nile virus in Jonesville.

On 29 Oct 2018, the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported that the Ohio Department of Agriculture (ODA) has confirmed 5 more cases of equine West Nile virus (WNV). Officials have now confirmed 48 cases of WNV in Ohio horses so far this year [2018] -- more than triple the number of cases confirmed last year [2017].

According to the ODA and EDCC, a 4-year-old Thoroughbred gelding from Cuyahoga County developed clinical signs on 7 Oct 2018. His trainer went to retrieve the horse from its stall and noticed it was lame on its right side. The track veterinarian responded and noticed that it was non-weightbearing with a fever of 102.4 deg F (39.1 deg C). The veterinarian suspected a high fracture, but the radiograph was negative. The horse's clinical signs progressed to a head tilt and muscle fasciculations (involuntary twitching) in the neck and shoulders, and eventually the horse went down. He was euthanized and brought to the ODA for a necropsy. After determining that brain tissue was negative for rabies, PCR assay at the ODA's Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, in Reynoldsburg, detected WNV nucleic acid in the horse's brain stem tissue.

A 7-year-old Quarter Horse gelding from Licking County began showing clinical signs on 4 Oct 2018. His owner noticed he was dragging his left leg, lethargic, and weakness in his hind legs. The owner also reported that he had a lack of appetite in the days prior. The veterinarian responded, found the horse down, and administered treatment. A serum sample was collected and submitted to the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service's (APHIS) National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL), in Ames, Iowa. They reported an IgM capture ELISA titer of 1:400 or greater, suggesting recent WNV exposure. The horse is alive and recovering as of 6 Oct 2018.

A 10-year-old Paint gelding from Holmes County was found down on 17 Oct 2018. The responding veterinarian found the horse was laterally recumbent (down and unable to rise) and had a temperature of 100.8 deg F (38.2 deg C). The veterinarian collected a serum sample and submitted it to the NVSL, which reported an IgM capture ELISA titer of 1:400 or greater, suggesting recent WNV exposure. The horse died on the night of 17 Oct 2018.

A 7-year-old Percheron mare from Holmes County developed clinical signs on 11 Oct 2018. The veterinarian received a call for a down, agitated horse; the veterinarian treated the horse, but it died spontaneously that night. A serum sample was collected and submitted to IDEXX Laboratories, which reported a positive IgM capture ELISA, suggesting recent WNV exposure.

A 16-year-old Paint gelding from Carroll County was found down in his pasture by his owner on 19 Oct 2018; he struggled to rise. The veterinarian responded, and the horse was down with a fever of 100 deg F (38 deg C), a heart rate of 65 beats per minute, an irregular respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, full-body muscle fasciculations, and hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound). The veterinarian treated the horse and collected a serum sample but was called back out the next day because the horse was down again. The horse was euthanized on 20 Oct 2018. The serum sample submitted to Cornell University, in Ithaca, New York, showed an IgM capture ELISA of 6.79 (3.3 or higher = positive), suggesting recent WNV exposure.

None of the horses were vaccinated against WNV. In 2017, officials confirmed 14 cases of WNV in Ohio horses, according to APHIS data.

WNV 101
West Nile virus is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Not all infected horses show clinical signs, but those that do can exhibit:
- Flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed;
- Fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculation;
- Hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound);
- Changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they're daydreaming or "just not with it";
- Occasional drowsiness;
- Propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and
- Spinal signs, including asymmetrical weakness; and
- Asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia.

WNV has no cure, although some horses can recover with supportive care. Equine mortality rates can reach 30% to 40%.

Studies have shown that vaccines can be effective WNV prevention tools. Horses vaccinated in past years need an annual booster shot, but veterinarians might recommend 2 boosters annually -- one in the spring and another in the fall -- in areas with prolonged mosquito seasons. In contrast, previously unvaccinated horses require a 2-shot vaccination series in a 3- to 6-week period. It takes several weeks for horses to develop protection against the disease following complete vaccination or booster administration.

In addition to vaccinations, owners should work to reduce mosquito population and breeding areas and limit horses' mosquito exposure by:
- Removing stagnant water sources;
- Dumping, cleaning, and refilling water buckets and troughs regularly;
- Keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times (typically early in the morning and evening); and
- Applying mosquito repellents approved for equine use.

[So many cases of horses suffering and most frequently losing the battle with this disease and either dying or being euthanized for humane reasons. How sad people are not getting the warning their horses need vaccinating. Could states, equine groups, veterinarians do a better a job of blanketing the area with flyers, public service announcements, etc. to vaccinate the horses? What about the rodeos, the play days, the dressage practices, any equine meeting putting up notices and requiring shot records prior to participating? Maybe it would help get the word out. Why are local news stories not providing information about equine disease the same way they do to vaccinate ourselves against the flu virus? Please don't say it's the money: It should be about health, for our horses, which is also about our emotional health. So please vaccinate your horses. - Mod.TG
