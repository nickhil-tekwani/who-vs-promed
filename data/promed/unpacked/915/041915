Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 22 Mar 2018
Date of confirmation of the event: 27 Mar 2018
Reason for notification: New strain of a listed disease in the country
Date of previous occurrence: 27 Apr 2017
Causal agent: Low pathogenic avian influenza [LPAI] virus
Serotype: H5N5
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1 (60): Precigne, Precigne, Sarthe
Date of start of the outbreak: 22 Mar 2018
Outbreak status: resolved 29 Mar 2018
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Birds / 13 000 / - / 0 / 13 000 / 0
Affected population: Influenza has been suspected after a fairly important mortality episode (28 percent) in premises with over 2500 turkeys, among others. The farm also had 13 000 ducks ready for gavage which did not show any signs. Both units were subjected to sampling to detect influenza, notably. The reference laboratory detected histomoniasis in those turkeys and an H5N5 AI virus of low pathogenicity in ducks that were being prepared for fattening. All birds in this backyard flock were depopulated and destroyed between 23-29 Mar 2018.

[Avian influenza viruses are divided by subtypes, based on 2 proteins found in the viruses: a hemagglutinin, or "H" protein, and a neuraminidase, or "N" protein. There are 16 H types and 9 N types yielding a total 144 possible combinations.

The H5 and H7 subtypes are of particular concern, given the ability of these 2 H-types to mutate from low pathogenic to highly pathogenic strains. These 2 H-types have been known to cause serious disease and mortality in domestic poultry http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/ai/fact-sheet/eng/1356193731667/1356193918453.

"Most AI virus strains are low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) and typically cause little or no clinical signs in infected poultry. The LPAI virus is excreted through infected birds' feces and secretions. It spreads primarily through direct contact between healthy and infected birds. It can also be spread through indirect contact with contaminated equipment and materials.

To prevent cases of LPAI, poultry producers must use special preventative measures and precautions on the farm. If LPAI is detected, farms must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. AI viruses are inactivated by heat and drying. They are also very sensitive to most disinfectants and detergents. To ensure thorough cleaning and disinfection, the area must be clear of organic material". https://tinyurl.com/y7rfdhx8

In addition to these 2 new reported events, since 2015 to date, France also continues to have 2 active events associated with LPAI H5N2 and H5N3. The situation for each of these LPAI events is as follows:

1. LPAI H5N2: event started Oct 2015; 27 outbreaks reported, and the event still continuing. See event summary and updated map: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=19299

2. LPAI H5N3: event started Dec 2015; 37 outbreaks reported, and the event still continuing. See event summary and updated map: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=19341.
