[3] 21% decline in cases
Date: Thu 25 Aug 2022 4:52 PM GMT+2

https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/who-reports-more-than-41000-cases-monkeypox-globally-2022-08-25/


The number of monkeypox cases reported globally declined by 21% last week [week of 15 Aug 2022], after a month-long trend of rising infections, the World Health Organization said on Thursday [25 Aug 2022].

The WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency in July 2022. So far, more than 41 000 cases of monkeypox and 12 deaths have been reported from 96 countries, with the majority of cases from the United States.

The decrease in case numbers may potentially signal that the outbreak is declining in the European region, according to WHO's latest epidemiological report.

"There are signs the outbreak is slowing in Europe, where a combination of effective public health measures, behavior change, and vaccination is helping to prevent transmission," WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a press briefing.

Still, nearly 2 dozen countries saw a rise in weekly case numbers with the highest increase reported in the United States. Over 34% of the current global case count is in the US.

The region of the Americas is continuing to see intense transmission and the region accounted for 60% of cases in the past month.

"In Latin America in particular, insufficient awareness or public health measures are combining with a lack of access to vaccines to fan the flames of the outbreak," Tedros said.

[4] Cases in women
Date: Thu 25 Aug 2022
Source: PAHO/WHO epidemiological update [edited]
https://www.paho.org/en/documents/epidemiological-update-monkeypox-women-26-august-2022


Between 1 Jan and 25 Aug 2022, a total of 46 048 confirmed cases, including 15 deaths, were reported from 99 Member States in all 6 World Health Organization (WHO) Regions. The 15 fatal cases were reported in Brazil (1), the Central African Republic (2), Cuba (1), Ecuador (1), Ghana (3), India (1), Nigeria (4), and Spain (2).

Of the 22 154 cases reported during 2022 for which there was information available on gender, 397 cases are among women (1.8%). The median age of this group is 30 years. The ratio of women to men in the WHO European Region is 1.2 per 100, and in the WHO Region of the Americas, it is 2.7 per 100. Of the 114 women who reported sexual orientation, 96% are heterosexual. Furthermore, sexual transmission was identified as the most likely mode of transmission among 61% of the women for whom there was available information.

[5] USA: vaccination non-compliance
Date: Fri 26 Aug 2022

https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/cdc-director-most-us-monkeypox-vaccine-shots-have-been-first-doses-2022-08-26/


Very few people who have gotten monkeypox shots in the United States have received the 2nd dose needed for full protection, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky said on Friday [26 Aug 2022].

She told a White House briefing that nearly 97% of the shots administered were 1st doses, and although many people are eligible for a 2nd dose, "very few" have been given so far.

Walensky said the CDC expected to gain more insight into the trend. Vaccine scarcity may have caused delays in 2nd shots previously but that was no longer the case, she said.

More than 207 000 doses of Bavarian Nordic's (BAVA.CO) Jynneos vaccine were given as of 23 Aug 2022 in the 19 jurisdictions reporting data to the CDC, Walensky said.

The vaccine needs to be given in 2 doses, 4 weeks apart, to be fully effective.

To expand access to the vaccine, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 9 Aug 2022 authorized giving it intradermally -- between the layers of the skin -- which would allow providers to get 5 doses from a single one-dose vial.

Bavarian Nordic has raised doubts about the safety of the method, citing a lack of evidence and the possible increased risk of reactions compared to injecting it into the muscle.

During the briefing on Friday [26 Aug 2022], officials said providers are reporting getting 4.5 to 5 doses per vial, but several experts told Reuters the figure is lower.

"The vast majority of health departments that I've talked to in the last week are feeling fortunate if they can get 4 doses out of a vial, and in some cases, 3," Dr Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota, said in an interview.

Dr Umar Shaw, secretary of health for Washington state, said on Thursday [25 Aug 2022] that many providers were getting 3 or 4 doses per vial.

Walensky confirmed that some U.S. jurisdictions were reporting a downward trend in monkeypox cases and that health officials were watching this with cautious optimism.

[6] India: heterosexual transmission

Highlights
----------
- A study showed that 3 out of 5 monkeypox cases in Delhi showed a history of heterosexual contact.
- It revealed that the other 2 cases among the 5 did not show any sexual contact.
- None of these cases showed bisexual or homosexual exposure.

Amid speculations over the contraction of monkeypox disease, a study conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) reported that 3 out of 3 monkeypox cases in Delhi showed a history of heterosexual contact.

The study, carried out by Pune's National Institute of Virology (NIV), revealed that the other 2 cases among 5 did not show any sexual contact.

"Cases 2, 3, and 5 shared the history of heterosexual contact within 21 days of onset of symptoms not under the influence of drugs or alcohol," a preliminary study has revealed.

Cases 1 and 4 had denied any sexual contact," the study stated.

It may be noted that none of these cases showed bisexual or homosexual exposure. "All the cases denied a history of same-sex contact or bisexual contact. This report describes the 5 cases of human monkeypox infection detected in India without any international travel history," the report stated.

"All the cases were mild and had a good recovery. These monkeypox cases suggest an underdiagnosed monkeypox infection in the community. This emphasizes the need for active surveillance of MPXV in a high-risk population such as men having sex with men (MSM) and female sex workers (FSW)," the report revealed.

As per the ICMR's report, no STDs (sexually transmitted diseases or infections) were identified but in one of the cases, HBV was reported (hepatitis B virus).

"The 4 cases had non-tender firm lymphadenopathy. No secondary complications or sexually transmitted infections were recorded in these cases except for HBV in one case," the ICMR's report stated.

Also, the report revealed that all the cases under study were not vaccinated against monkeypox or smallpox. Of the 5 cases, 3 were males while 2 were females, with a mean age of 31.2 years and they recorded a mild to moderate grade intermittent fever with myalgia.

The study further revealed that oral, throat, urine, or nose swabs are appropriate specimens for monkeypox diagnosis. "OPS [oropharyngeal swabs ], NPS [nasopharyngeal swabs], and urine are found to be the other appropriate specimens.

Considering the evolvement in the clinical presentation of monkeypox cases (single lesion/other symptoms without lesion/asymptomatic), OPS, NPS, and urine samples could be utilised for the MPXV diagnosis," the study revealed.
