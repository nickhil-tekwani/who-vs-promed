The Seremi de Salud [Regional Health Ministerial Secretariat] of Los Lagos has confirmed this year's [2019] 1st case of infection by hantavirus in the Chilean region.

The patient, a female employee of the Health Service of Chile, was taken to Santiago after it was confirmed that she had been infected with the virus in Epuyén, Argentina, which is located 4 hours from Palena. The woman resides in the city of Palena, in the Los Lagos Region, and remains hospitalized in the Puerto Montt Hospital since [Sat 5 Jan 2019].

"During the dawn of today [Mon 7 Jan 2019] we received the information on the blood tests of the patient from the province of Palena, that were undergone at the Universidad de Católica de Chile-- which is a certified center for the realization of this type of exams --, and it confirmed a case of [a] hantavirus [infection]," informed Marcela Cárdenas, a health officer in Los Lagos.

Hantaviruses are spread via the urine, saliva, and feces of infected rodents and [the infection] is contracted via contact with contaminated surfaces or via inhalation of contaminated air.

The most common symptoms of the virus [infection] are similar to those of influenza: fever, muscle aches, and fatigue. Other possible symptoms include headaches, dizziness, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain [and respiratory distress leading to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome]. Hantavirus [infections] are fatal in roughly 1/3rd of cases.

Those present in Chile should avoid exposure to potentially rodent-infested areas. Individuals exhibiting the aforementioned symptoms are advised to seek immediate medical treatment.

[Although the woman was hospitalized in Los Lagos region, Chile, she acquired her infection in Epuyén, Chubut province, Argentina. Epuyén is located in the Andes mountains, and the virus most likely involved, although not stated, is Andes hantavirus, which is endemic in the southern Andes. This is the beginning of the summer season there, when cases of hantavirus infection occur. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person to person and only through close physical contact, usually within the family. The most common source of the infection is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat or its excretions. The patient likely came into contact with areas inhabited by the rodent reservoir of the virus in the region.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the Sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg. - Mod.TY
