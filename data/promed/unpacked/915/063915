An epidemic of diarrhoea has killed 74 people in Pointe-Noire in
southwestern Congo, where 243 cases have been reported since November,
Radio Congo said Saturday.
Health ministry officials and local medical authorities were still trying
to determine the cause of the epidemic, the radio said, monitored across
the Congo River in Kinshasa, the capital of the neighbouring Democratic
Republic of Congo.
