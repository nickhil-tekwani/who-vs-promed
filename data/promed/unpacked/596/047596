On 10 Jul 2007, the press service of the Ministry of Extreme
Situations of Kyrgyzstan, referring to information from the Central
State Sanitary and Epidemiologic Supervision, reported that 39 cases
of malaria had been registered in Bishkek [the capital, 2005 pop.
approx. 900 000 - Mod.JW] At present, all 39 patients with malaria are
being treated in the Republican infectious diseases hospital. They are
inhabitants of the area. 21 persons live in the Bishkek districts of
Akbosogo, Kolmo and Kalys-Ordo, and 12 persons are non-residents,
according to the Ministry of Extreme Situations.

[The malaria situation in Bishkek, compared with last year [2006], has
improved. For the same period from 2006, 70 cases of malaria were
registered in Bishkek (see
<http://www.mirtv.ru/show.php?id=14800&templ=news>).
Since 2006, the project of the Global Fund to fight HIV, tuberculosis
and malaria has supported malaria control in Kyrgyzstan. Most cases
are _Plasmodium vivax_ malaria, and the main reasons for its emergence
over the last years are a reduction of preventive measures concerning
mosquito vectors, the unsatisfactory condition of irrigation systems
in rice plantations (in particular, those closely located to
settlements), and the increasing migration of the population (seasonal
workers, businessmen, immigrants, refugees, students).
_Plasmodium falciparum_ cases are seen, but most cases are imported
from other regions of Central Asia, especially from Tajikistan,
hosting more than 90 000 refugees from Afghanistan. The peak of
malaria in Kyrgyzstan was in 2002-2005, when about 3000 cases of
malaria were diagnosed annually. In 2006, the morbidity of malaria
decreased to 300 cases. - Mod.NP]
