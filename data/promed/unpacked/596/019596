Concerns about a possible tick fever outbreak in the state's north have been fuelled by the deaths of 22 cattle on a property at Quirindi earlier this month [May 2012].

This latest incident follows from a further 6 cattle deaths near Grafton in mid April 2012. While cattle tick cases are not unusual -- with estimates of between 60 and 80 cases each year -- it is rare to have an outbreak of tick fever itself, particularly in the Tamworth region, where the deaths occurred. This is especially the case given that new cattle tick infestations are down in NSW this year [2012] by 15 per cent.

The NSW [New South Wales] Department of Primary Industries (DPI) regional veterinary officer Samantha Allan said there were 390 remaining cattle on the Quirindi property, all of which were being monitored for signs of tick fever. The property has been quarantined, and the cattle will undergo a treatment program to eradicate ticks.

"Tracing of stock movements on and off the property is also being undertaken to check the source of the disease and the potential for further spread," Ms Allan said.

"Now we have this case in the Tamworth district; all cattle producers should check their stock and report any unusual ticks to the NSW DPI or the Livestock Health and Pest Authority (LHPA).

"Cattle ticks, which can spread tick fever, are more usually found on the northeast of the state, but they can occur anywhere in NSW." She said tick fever was caused by a parasite of red blood cells and that the only thing that can spread tick fever are cattle ticks.

"Signs of tick fever in cattle include fever for several days, loss of appetite, weakness, a reluctance to move, and red urine," she said. The outbreak of tick fever on another cattle property at Tynedale, north of Grafton, in April 2012 resulted in 6 cattle deaths.

Original inspections of neighbouring properties found one to be infected with tick fever, itself possibly the source of the infestation.

Queensland Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry veterinary officer with the Tick Fever Centre at Wacol Peter Rolls said tick fever outbreaks usually occur in areas where cattle ticks are endemic, such as along the eastern side of Queensland and across the north of Australia.

He said _Bos taurus_ breeds were particularly susceptible, as opposed to Brahman cattle and other _Bos indicus_ breeds, which are more resistant to tick fever.

"There were massive losses of cattle due to tick fever in the late 1800s and early 1900s," Mr Rolls said.

"A 2005 MLA (Meat and Livestock Australia) report estimated tick fever cost the northern beef industry about AUD 26 million [USD 25.7 million] per annum."

Losses close to AUD 50 000 [USD 49 350] have been estimated for some outbreaks on individual properties.

A tick fever vaccine is available for use in the endemic areas, and since 1966 (when the Tick Fever Centre was also established), more than 35 million doses of the vaccine have been supplied.

[Tick fever in NSW is likely to be a disease also known as bovine babesiosis. Although it has not been specified in this article or in several other articles, it is likely babesiosis. There is a chance it could be _Theileria_, so we will be looking for the official diagnosis of this situation.

Bovine babesiosis is caused by 2 organisms in Australia: _Babesia bovis_ and _Babesia bigemina_. Of the 2 species, _B. bovis_ is by far the most important, causing about 80 percent of outbreaks and an even higher percentage of deaths. Both _Babesia_ species are single cell organisms that develop in the red blood cells of cattle and are transmitted in Australia by the cattle tick _Boophilus microplus_.

Transmission of _B. bovis_ takes place when engorging adult female ticks pick up the infection. They pass it on to their progeny via their eggs. Larvae (or seed ticks) then pass it on in turn when feeding on another animal. _B. bigemina_ is also passed from one generation of ticks to the next. Engorging adult ticks pick up the infection, and nymphal and adult stages (not larval stages) of the next generation pass it on to other cattle.

British and European breeds are very susceptible, and mortality after infection with _Babesia_ species can be high. _Bos indicus_ breeds such as Brahman, Sahiwal and, to a lesser extent, crossbred cattle show resistance to the disease. Despite this, nearly one in 5 outbreaks of tick fever involves these breeds.

Calves from immune mothers receive temporary protection (maternal antibody) from the colostrum (1st milk), which prevents clinical disease in the short term. However, the calves may still be infected at this time. This protection lasts about 3 months and, in most cases, is followed by an age resistance that lasts until the animals are about 9 months old. Calves exposed to infection when the maternal or age resistance is high rarely show clinical symptoms but develop a solid, long-lasting immunity.

It is, therefore, possible to have both _Babesia_ organisms and cattle ticks present on a property without animal losses or clinical disease. This situation is known as endemic stability. On the other hand, cattle not exposed to babesiosis as calves will become susceptible to infection as the age resistance gradually wanes with time.

If exposed to the disease later in life, they may well develop a severe, life-threatening infection. Losses are likely when tick numbers on a property increase or when susceptible cattle are brought onto a tick-infested property. Endemic stability is less likely to develop to _B. bovis_ than to _B. bigemina_ because _B. bovis_ has lower infection rates in ticks than _B. bigemina_. Disease caused by _B. bovis_ is normally severe, and large numbers of cattle can get sick and die.

Clinical signs include: fever (higher than 40 C) for several days before other signs become obvious, loss of appetite, depression, weakness and a reluctance to move, red urine (haemoglobinuria) followed by anaemia and jaundice in the latter stages of infection, diarrhoea, abortion in cows, death within days of the onset of fever, nervous signs caused by a condition known as cerebral babesiosis.

When the nervous signs of cerebral babesiosis develop, the outcome is almost always fatal. Clinical signs include: hypersensitivity, circling, head pressing, aggression, convulsions, paralysis.

Disease caused by _B. bigemina_ is usually less severe but can develop very rapidly: anaemia occurs suddenly and severely; jaundice and death can occur with little warning; red urine is present earlier and more consistently than in _B. bovis_ infections; nervous signs are not seen.

Cattle that recover from either infection may take several weeks to regain condition but recovery is usually complete. Surviving bulls may have reduced fertility for several weeks or months. In mild infections, signs are less obvious and sometimes even difficult to detect. Calves usually show no clinical signs after infection.

The only drug available for use in the treatment of babesiosis in Australia is Imidocarb.

Note: Imidocarb has a 28-day withholding period in cattle, and restrictions apply to its use in lactating dairy cattle in Australia.

Recovery is the rule if treatment is given early in the course of the infection. If treatment is delayed, supportive therapy may be essential if the animal is to survive. This includes the use of blood transfusions, intravenous administration of fluids, good nutrition, shade, and perhaps other supportive therapies.

There are several options for the prevention of babesiosis in Australia, ranging from keeping animals tick-free and the use of Imidocarb for short-term control to vaccinating with tick fever vaccine.
