China: Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease on Increase in Beijing
--------------------------------------------------
Hand foot and mouth disease is currently spreading fast among Beijing
children. Director Zhao of the Beijing City Haidian Hospital Pediatric
Department says that since the start of winter this year, the number of
hand, foot and mouth disease patients treated at Haidian Hospital's
Pediatric Department has shown a clear increase over previous years.
During the peak period of this disease in the past, there would be one case
every 2 or 3 days. But this year there are 3 or 4 children diagnosed with
hand, foot and mouth disease each day. Expert Jin Qi of China's CDC says,
hand, foot and mouth disease appears every year in Beijing. Although the
mortality rate for patients with hand, foot and mouth disease does not
exceed 1 percent, if it leads to meningitis, at this [time] there is still
no effective medical treatment.
According to a report in "The Beijing News", a child was diagnosed by
doctors at Haidian Hospital with hand, foot and mouth disease. Conditions
in one class at his preschool are serious. Within that class there are only
3 of 4 pupils still in attendance. And within his class of 35 students,
there are already over 10 who have come down with this illness. The mother
of another infected student says that she knows of 7 parents whose children
have all caught hand, foot and mouth disease in recent days.
The report cites a teacher, who wished to remain anonymous, at the attached
preschool of China People's University, who said that a month ago the
school had children suffering from hand, foot and mouth disease. Ill
students came from 2 of the school's 20 classes. But the school did not
suspend classes at the time. Now, basically all the children who caught
this disease have returned to class.
Vice Director Jin Qi of the China CDC Institute of Virology's State Key
Laboratory of Molecular Virology and Genetic Engineering said that
following hand, foot and mouth disease outbreaks in recent years in
Singapore, Taiwan and other places, the health departments in these regions
pay relatively high attention to investigation, prevention, and viral
research of this disease. At present, China's Ministry of Health is
considering making hand, foot and mouth disease a legally reportable disease.
Hand, foot and mouth disease is a commonly occurring infectious disease
caused by an intestinal virus. Most patients are children under 5 years of
age. It can lead to fever and rashes and ulcers on the hand, foot, mouth,
and other spots. In exceptional cases it can lead to life-threatening
complications like myocarditis, acute lung edema, and aseptic meningitis.

[Various enteric viruses have been associated with hand, foot and mouth
disease outbreaks in East and South-east Asia. Enterovirus 71 is perhaps
the most frequently isolated virus. Further information on the identity of
the virus associated with this outbreak in Beijing and the concurrent
outbreak in Hong Kong would be appreciated. - Mod.CP]
