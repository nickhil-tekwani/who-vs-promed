Capillariasis in seafood kills dozens in Zambo villages
---------------------------------------------------
Health officials confirmed the capillariasis outbreak in several
villages of the town of Zamboanga del Norte where more than 70
people, including children, have reportedly died. Dr. Raymund Nadela,
municipal health officer, expressed alarm over the health situation
in some villages, saying that the capillaria worm (Capillaria
philippinensis) attack "is now an outbreak."

Based on random tests of wastes from 326 residents in the area, 81
people have been found positive for the disease, Nadela said.
Emeliano Villalon, chair of Barangay Moyo, said that since he was
elected in late October [2007], a total of 31 adults and 9 children
have died of capillariasis. Villalon said 38 others died from April
to August [2007]. But Nadela said he could not "outrightly say those
who died earlier were confirmed to have capillariasis. We labeled
them as deaths with suspected capillariasis," he said.

Nadela said the victims got the disease from eating freshwater fish
and shrimps from the nearby rivers of Siayan. "These shrimps and fish
are carrying this type of worm known as capillaria, a microscopic
worm that gets into the intestine and eats up all the nutrition of
the person," he said.

Maria Teresita dela Cruz, information officer of the Department of
Health in Western Mindanao, said some people in the province "love to
eat kinilaw and there is a particular fish from the river which they
love to eat raw with vinegar." Dela Cruz said other than Siayan town,
the health department received the same report in the village of
Femagas in Katipunan town. "But we don't have clear records as of
this moment," she said.

Virgilio Lumawas, 43, a farmer of Moyo village, survived
capillariasis but still complained of diarrhea. Nadela said patients
found with capillaria worms showed symptoms like diarrhea, extreme
abdominal pain that leads to anemia, and muscle wasting. "People
think that they have gas pains, but the pain becomes excruciating
coupled with a gurgling sound, then the patient could hardly eat or
sleep," Nadela explained.

Siayan Mayor Wilfredo Suasico said he became alarmed by the
deteriorating health situation "when I keep on signing for approval
request letters and solicitations for coffins." Since October [2007],
Suasico said, he had granted the release of funds for the purchase of
32 coffins intended for the villages of Moyo, Dinuyan, Poblacion
Lopot, Polayo, Balunukan and Baloc.

The outbreak and the hardest hit, according to Nadela, is Moyo
village where, Suasico said, a total 24 coffins were delivered last
month [October 2007]. Nadela said that aside from capillariasis, the
town was noted for the presence of lymphatic filariasis or
elephantiasis, an abnormal growth of the lymphatic nodes due to a
mosquito-borne disease that attacks the blood, and leprosy. Although
the cases of filariasis and leprosy have been taken care of since 2
years ago, Nadela still considers the diseases serious in some
villages of Siayan.

[Infected birds excrete eggs which are swallowed by fish where the
nematode develop in the muscles. Birds or man are infected by eating
raw fish (see
<http://www.dpd.cdc.gov/dpdx/HTML/Capillariasis.htm>). In man
_Capillariasis philippinensis_ penetrate the intestinal wall and
cause a severe inflammation when the larvae die. Diagnosis is based
on geographical location or visit to an endemic area, the clinical
picture with diarrhoea and abdominal pain, a high eosinophil count
and elevated total-IgE and detection of Capillaria eggs in feces.
Capillaria can be treated by mebendazole or albendazole.
