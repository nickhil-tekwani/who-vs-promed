[3] WHO: assessment summary
Date: Tue 1 Nov 2022

The World Health Organization (WHO) monkeypox emergency committee met for the 3rd time on 20 Oct 2022 to discuss the latest developments, concluding that the situation still warrants a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC).

In a statement today [1 Nov 2022] on their deliberations, the group said progress has been made, such as behavioral interventions and increasing vaccine uptake. However, they raised concerns about ongoing transmission in some regions, health inequities in a number of countries, and impacts on vulnerable populations, especially in those with HIV and in countries with weak health systems.

The group noted that since the public health emergency was declared on 23 Jul [2022], many countries responded to the outbreak, which led to interventions that have driven down cases at the global level. Ll.

However, officials said the progress reflects a mixed picture. The global risk is currently moderate but is high in the Americas. The risk declined from high to moderate in the European region, remained moderate in the African, Eastern Mediterranean, and South-East Asia regions, and remained low in the Western Pacific region.

WHO emergency committees typically meet every 3 months or more often as needed.
