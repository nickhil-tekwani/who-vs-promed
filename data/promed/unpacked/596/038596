In light of a large outbreak of the mosquito-borne viral disease, Zika fever, in the islands of French Polynesia, including Tahiti, the [US] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a travel notice on 22 Jan [2014].

According to the latest data from the French Polynesia Department of Health, there have been 361 laboratory-confirmed cases and 7156 suspected cases reported throughout the 15 islands as of 13 Jan [2014].

Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus related to yellow fever, dengue, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis viruses; however, ZIKV produces a comparatively mild disease in humans. It was 1st isolated from an infected [sentinel] rhesus monkey in the Zika Forest of Uganda in 1947.

It is relatively rare to see ZIKV outside of Africa and Asia.

The virus is transmitted to humans via mosquitoes of the genus _Aedes_.

Information regarding pathogenesis of ZIKV is scarce but mosquito-borne flaviviruses are thought to replicate initially in dendritic cells near the site of inoculation, then spread to lymph nodes and the bloodstream.

Symptoms may include headache and a maculopapular rash covering the face, neck, trunk, and upper arms, which may spread to the palms and soles. Transient fever, malaise, and back pain may also develop.

ZIKV can be diagnosed by PCR tests, which detect viral RNA, and an ELISA has been developed at the Arboviral Diagnostic and Reference Laboratory of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Ft. Collins, Colorado, USA) to detect immunoglobulin (Ig) M to ZIKV.

The federal health agency says there is currently no vaccine or medicine to prevent Zika fever. Travelers can protect themselves by preventing mosquito bites.

This includes covering exposed skin, using insect repellent that contains DEET, staying and sleeping in screened or air-conditioned rooms and using a bed net if the area where you are sleeping is exposed to the outdoors.

The mosquito that carries Zika virus can bite during the day and night, both indoors and outdoors, and often lives around buildings in urban areas.

[Zika virus transmission continues on the French Polynesian islands. The total number of Zika virus infection cases in French Polynesia has increased from 333 confirmed cases and 6630 suspected cases on 9 Jan 2014 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20140110.2165365) to 361 confirmed and 7156 suspected cases 4 days later, as of 13 Jan 2014, as reported above. As noted above, there is no vaccine available for this virus, and the only available preventive measures are mosquito vector control and avoidance of mosquito bites.
