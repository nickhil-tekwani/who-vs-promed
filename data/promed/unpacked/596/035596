Mosquito-borne disease warning for the Kimberley region
-------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health is warning residents and travellers in the Kimberley region to take precautions to avoid mosquito bites, following heavy rainfall, flooding and the 1st evidence of Kunjin virus activity this season.

Since the beginning of January [2022], large parts of the Kimberley have received above average wet-season rainfall that has resulted in flooding and an increase in mosquito-borne virus activity.

Kunjin virus has been detected for the 1st time this season, through the Department of Health's sentinel chicken surveillance program, which provides early warning of virus activity within the environment.

Department of Health Managing Scientist, Dr Abbey Potter, said Kunjin virus is transmitted to people through the bite of an infected mosquito.

"Most people infected with Kunjin virus do not develop symptoms. In rare cases, the disease can lead to nausea, drowsiness, headache, dizziness, neck stiffness, confusion and seizures. People experiencing these symptoms should seek medical advice urgently," she said.

In young children, fever might be the only early sign of infection. Parents should see their doctor or local health service if concerned. If their child experiences drowsiness, floppiness, irritability, seizures, poor feeding, or general distress they should seek medical attention urgently.

There is currently no specific treatment or vaccine for the virus. The only effective way to prevent infection is to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes.

It is important that residents and travellers to the Kimberley region take the following simple steps to avoid mosquito bites:
- avoid outdoor exposure, particularly at dawn and early evening
- wear protective (long, loose-fitting, light-coloured) clothing when outdoors
- apply an effective personal repellent containing diethyltoluamide (DEET) or picaridin evenly to all areas of exposed skin and always follow the label instructions
- ensure insect screens are installed and in good condition on houses and caravans
- use mosquito nets and mosquito-proof tents if sleeping outside
- ensure infants and children are adequately protected against mosquito bites, preferably with suitable clothing, shoes/socks, bed nets or other forms of insect screening.

[Positive sentinel chickens indicate that Kunjin virus is again being transmitted in Western Australia. Kunjin virus is endemic in Australia and human and equine infections occur there sporadically. Interestingly, there are Kunjin virus infections in equine animals across New South Wales currently. There is now a health risk for humans and equine animals in 2 states, New South Wales in the east and Western Australia in the west.

Both states have experienced unusual rainfall and flooding, with the creation of extensive mosquito breeding sites. The principal mosquito vectors for Kunjin virus are _Culex annulirostris_, _Cu. pseudovishnui_, and _Cu. squamosus_. _Aedes albopictus_ has been identified as a potential vector for Kunjin virus in Australia (see Kunjin virus - Australia (02): (NT) background 20190403.6403071).

Kunjin virus (KUN), a subtype of West Nile virus, was first isolated in Australia in 1960 from mosquitoes (_Culex annulirostris_). The virus is named for an Aboriginal clan living on the Mitchell River in Kowanyama, northern Queensland. Most cases of human infection are reported in Australia, with sporadic reports from Nepal. In Australia, Kunjin virus infection is more widely distributed than another flavivirus disease, Murray Valley encephalitis. The yearly incidence varies from 0 to 9 cases per year. - Mod.TY
