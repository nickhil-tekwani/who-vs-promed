California confirms its 4th West Nile virus (WNV) case in 2020. A San Joaquin County horse succumbed to the mosquitoborne disease. Other California cases have been confirmed in Amador, Merced, and Stanislaus counties.

On 13 Aug 2020, a San Joaquin County horse with unknown vaccination history was confirmed with WNV after presenting with neurologic signs. The 8 year old Friesian stallion was subsequently euthanized.

The day before, a 17 year old quarter horse gelding in Merced County was also confirmed positive for WNV. According to the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA), the horse, which had no vaccination history, displayed neurologic signs and subsequently died.

The state's 2nd case of 2020, an unvaccinated 2 year old quarter horse colt from Stanislaus County, was confirmed positive on 3 Aug 2020. California's index case, located in Amador County, was confirmed on 26 Jun 2020.

On 24 Aug 2020, officials at the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) confirmed the state's 5th case of West Nile virus (WNV) this year [2020]. The affected horse, an 8 year old Andalusian stallion from Riverside County, displayed onset of clinical signs on 12 Aug 2020. Signs included fever, hind limb ataxia (loss of muscle control), and proprioceptive (perception of body position) deficits in his limbs. The horse, which was unvaccinated, is recovering.

According to a CDFA statement, this is California's 5th confirmed case of WNV in 2020. Other positive horses were from Amador (1), Merced (1), San Joaquin (1), and Stanislaus (1) counties. Three of the 5 were unvaccinated, and 2 had unknown vaccination histories. Three horses have survived, 1 died, and 1 was euthanized.

About West Nile virus
---------------------
WNV transmission occurs when infected mosquitoes feed on animals, as well as humans, after having fed on infected birds.

Clinical signs of WNV in horses include:
- mild anorexia and depression;
- fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculation;
- hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound);
- changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they're daydreaming or "just not with it";
- occasional drowsiness;
- propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control);
- spinal signs, including asymmetrical weakness; and
- asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia.

WNV has no cure; however, some horses can recover with supportive care. Equine mortality rates can reach 30%-40%. The American Association of Equine Practitioners includes WNV as one of the core diseases all horses should be vaccinated against at least annually.

Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) officials have confirmed 4 Lee County horses with West Nile virus (WNV), bringing the state's total number of equine WNV cases to 5 and Lee County's to 3 [sic: details of 4 horses are given below. - Mod.SH].

On 10 Aug 2020, a 2 year old grade colt and a yearling grade colt exhibited clinical signs of WNV including fever, muscle twitching, and hind end weakness. Both horses were unvaccinated, and both are reported as affected and alive.

On 14 Aug 2020, an unvaccinated 2 year old quarter horse mare began experiencing unspecified clinical signs. She was confirmed positive on 20 Aug 2020 and is reported as recovering.

On 18 Aug 2020, an undervaccinated 5 year old quarter horse mare showed clinical signs including fever and muscle twitching. She is reported as recovering.

[West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquitoborne virus first detected in the USA in the New York City area in 1999. Since 1999, the virus has spread throughout the USA and Canada, infecting birds, humans, horses, and other animals. The virus is maintained in the wild bird population and is spread between birds by mosquitos. Birds are considered the natural reservoir for WNV since high levels of virus circulate in their bloodstream. Mosquitos acquire WNV in blood meals from infected birds and pass it on to other birds, animals, and people. Mosquitos that feed on an infected horse or human have not demonstrated the ability to ingest enough of the virus to transmit it to other animals or humans; therefore, horses and humans are considered "dead end hosts".

Clinical signs: WNV may cause a wide range of clinical illness ranging from mild "flu-like" signs to encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) that may be fatal to both humans and horses. While horses are susceptible to WNV infection, many infected horses do not develop clinical illness and recover uneventfully.

Consult a veterinarian if your horse exhibits any of the following clinical signs:
- fever
- incoordination, especially in rear limbs, causing stumbling and falling
- generalized weakness, muscle twitching, seizures or coma
- drooping lips and lip smacking, head drooping, grinding teeth
- hypersensitivity to touch or sound
- recumbency (inability to rise)

Diagnosis: Any horse displaying abnormal behavior or neurologic signs should be examined by a veterinarian to rule out neurologic diseases, such as WNV, equine herpes virus-1, equine protozoal myeloencephalopathy, eastern/western encephalomyelitis and rabies.

Blood samples should be collected by a veterinarian and sent for diagnostic testing. The WNV IgM capture ELISA test is a specific test that detects acute WNV infection in animals, is usually positive within 6 days post-infection and can remain positive for up to 2 months post-infection. A positive WNV IgM capture ELISA test is indicative of recent infection. Unexposed animals vaccinated for WNV will test negative on the WNV IgM capture ELISA test.

Treatment and prognosis: Currently, there is no specific treatment for WNV. Supportive care includes administration of anti-inflammatory drugs and intravenous fluids. Recumbent WNV-positive horses are at a higher risk of dying or requiring euthanasia. For horses exhibiting clinical signs of WNV, the case fatality rate is approximately 33%; however, many infected horses will fully recover following infection.

Prevention: Vaccination and mosquito control minimize the risk of WNV infection in horses. Although the number of WNV-infected horses has declined over the last 5 years, WNV remains an important disease in unvaccinated horses. The American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) recommends incorporation of a WNV vaccine as an annual core vaccine in equine vaccination protocols. Currently, there are 4 US Department of Agriculture (USDA)-licensed WNV vaccines available for horses in the USA. Horse owners should consult with their veterinary practitioner to ensure current WNV vaccination status of their horses.

Mosquito control: Minimizing horse exposure to mosquitoes during the peak mosquito feeding periods at dawn and dusk decreases the risk of horse exposure to WNV. Application of mosquito repellant can also effectively reduce the number of mosquito bites on horses. Mosquito control efforts to eliminate mosquito breeding sites are also important. Methods to eliminate mosquito breeding sites include:
- draining unnecessary standing water found in wheelbarrows, tires, etc.
- cleaning water containers at least weekly (such as bird baths, plant saucers)
- scheduling pasture irrigation to minimize standing water
- keeping swimming pools optimally chlorinated and draining water from pool covers
- stocking of water tanks with fish that consume mosquito larvae (Contact local mosquito control for assistance) or use mosquito "dunk" available at hardware stores.
