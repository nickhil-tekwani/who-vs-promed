The outbreak of AH7N3 influenza is on the rise and the virus has been reported to be present in 52 farms and 4 backyard farms in Guanajuato and Jalisco states. The number of [culled] birds is now 3 749 000, according to a report issued by the National Service for Agricultural and Alimentary Sanitation, Safety, and Quality (SENASICA, according to its Spanish initials).

After 5 weeks of having recognized the presence of this highly pathogenic virus in these areas of Mexico, these are the official figures for dead animals:
- 1 984 000 broilers
- 847 000 large breeders
- 918 221 laying hens

A total of 131 600 000 vaccine [doses] have been administered in farms in Jalisco, Aguascalientes, and Guanajuato, as well as in 9 additional federal entities, aiming to prevent the occurrence of this disease in long-living birds, which constitute the main source of avian production in Mexico.

So far, 117 out of 158 farms have already been inspected in Guanajuato. The virus was found to be present in 25 farms, while 2 of 195 backyard farms were declared as positive. In both cases, the facilities had been disinfected and sanitized, in order to start repopulation.

To date, 535 farms, as well as 135 backyard farms, have been evaluated in Jalisco, and the virus was detected in 27 farms and 2 backyard farms.

With the epidemiological surveillance actions that already have been taken throughout the country, according to an Emergency Decree for Animal Sanitation (DINESA, according to its Spanish initials), it has been established that the virus is confined within the sanitary barrier that has been implemented, and no A (H7N3) virus has been detected in any other area in Mexico.

According to the National Union of Poultrymen (UNA, according to its Spanish initials), financial losses are far above 400 million Pesos (32 million US Dollars).

Mexican Poultrymen assured that there will be no production gaps because of this occurrence, so there is no reason for price rises.

- Eggs cost between 30 to 32 Mexican Pesos (2.44-2.60 USD) per Kilogram
- Chicken breasts cost between 55 and 79 Mexican Pesos (4.47-6.41 USD) per Kilogram
- Chicken leg quarters cost between 40 to 55 Mexican Pesos (3.25-4.47 USD) per Kilogram

[Sadly this disease does not seem to have been reined in nearly as quickly as officials had hoped. This disease has been marching rather steadily for likely more than the 5 weeks mentioned in this report.

ProMED-mail 1st reported the suspected virus in Jalisco on 26 Jan 2013. This is now the end of March. So if the disease was suspected then, it may have gone undetected for a week prior to the time of reporting. This seems to be [much] more than 5 weeks.

It is potentially shaping up to be as ugly as last year's outbreak when the price of eggs skyrocketed. They seem to be holding better on cost of production, but without more rapid controls this fragile hold on the pricing structure may falter.
