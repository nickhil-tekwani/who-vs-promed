Bird flu leaps out of hot-zone in western Canada
---------------------------------------------------
Bird flu has skipped outside a tightly quarantined high-risk zone and has
sprung up at another farm in western Canada, health authorities said.
7 poultry farms have now been hit by the disease, which has prompted a cull
of hundreds of thousands of birds and prompted bans of Canadian poultry
exports around the world.
The latest farm to be hit was sealed off on Mon 29 Mar after tests
suggested birds there may have been infected. The Canadian Food Inspection
Agency (CFIA) said in a statement that those tests had now proved positive.
A 2nd farm in the control area, but outside the high-risk area where 6 bird
flu cases have already been confirmed, had also been quarantined, it said.
"The Agency has now confirmed avian influenza infection on 7 commercial
farms, 6 within the high-risk region, and one in the broader control area,"
the statement said. "Avian influenza has also been detected in 3 small
non-commercial flocks in the high-risk region. All birds from these
non-commercial flocks have been destroyed."
The CFIA cautioned however that the strain of H7 avian flu found in Canada
was not as dangerous as the strain which has killed 23 people and resulted
in the culling of millions of fowl in Asia.
The 1st case of the H7 avian flu was detected in February 2004 on a farm in
Abbotsford near Vancouver.
The European Union on Tue Mar 30 2004 lifted a blanket ban on poultry
imports from Canada and the United States, leaving restrictions only on
fowl from affected areas.
