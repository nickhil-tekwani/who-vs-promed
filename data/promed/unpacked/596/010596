Dozens of cattle breeders in Rastan, Houla, Tal al-Shor, Qusayr, and around the country have complained of an outbreak of lumpy skin disease (LSD) in the past 2 months, resulting in a massive cattle infestation of 60-70%. Many have died, causing heavy losses. There is no real cure for the disease except for a vaccine, which was given in an inappropriate period, the breeders said. According to veterinarians, the vaccine needed to be given in the 3rd month of the year, but laxity in its administration caused it to be taken at the end of July and the beginning of August [2019].

The breeders held the authorities responsible for the lack of awareness-raising (especially the agricultural extension) in dealing with this situation and the need to clarify the nature of the disease and how to deal with it. This made breeders easy prey to veterinarians who both worked to raise, up to fourfold, the breeders' price for veterinary medicines and gave repeated vaccines, as well as to traders whose role was to buy cows heads at low prices for fear of death or injury to healthy livestock.

The breeders pointed out that after the emergence of this disease and its spread in the region, the breeders submitted complaints, and the directorate of agriculture in Homs [Hims] tried to stop the situation. The directorate of the Department of Animal Health visited these areas and met with a group of breeders to view the infected livestock in order to characterize the disease and its treatment with medication, isolation, and hygiene, but failed to follow through, especially in regard to dealing with veterinarians who exploited the breeders' panic and raised drastically the prices of inspection and treatment.

The director of Homs Agriculture, Mohammed Nazih Al-Rifai, confirmed to Al-Watan that lumpy skin disease in cows is a contagious viral skin disease transmitted mainly by bites of flies and mosquitoes. All epidemic diseases [require] adherence to dates in order to give the animal immunity before the disease appears in it. The director pointed out that the disease is currently under control in the province.

The head of the Animal Health Department in the directorate of Agriculture Faleh Abdul Samad (for the homeland) said that in 2019 this disease has clearly re-emerged in the western region adjacent to the Orontes Basin, spreading from the south to the regions of Jabourin and Qin al-Assi in the north, and the spread was helped by the movement of cattle through the traders between regions and breeders.

In addition to the Ministry of Agriculture's lack of interest in spraying insecticides, Abdul Samad pointed to the ministry's avoidance of introducing a vaccine for fear the disease would settle in Syria, instead attempting to replace a vaccine with a double quantity of sheep pox vaccine. For cattle infected with the disease, secondary symptoms such as high temperature are treated with antibiotics and vitamins to prevent potential secondary bacterial interventions, thus raising immunity.

Abdul Samad confirmed that there are about 80 000 head of cows, according to the statistics of the agricultural directorate in Homs governorate; all the cows were vaccinated with sheep pox vaccine due to the great similarity [about 98%] between the strain that causes sheep pox and the strain causing LSD in cows. The number of cows in the areas of the Orontes Basin is about 60 000 head of cows, and the number of LSD infections among cows in those areas reached about 50%. Thus, about 30 000 heads were treated, and most of them recovered, but 5-10%, equivalent to about 3000 cows, were excluded and killed after not responding to treatment. He pointed out that this disease is causing large economic losses for meat and milk due to a significant decrease in the weight of the infected animal and a lack of milk production. In some cases, it also may cause abortion in the cows. To reduce the spread of this disease and eliminate it, the factor of transmission of infection -- insects -- must be eliminated. Therefore, it is necessary to continuously spray with insecticides. The governate has distributed pesticides to administrative units since the beginning of the summer and in appropriate quantities.

Abdul Samad confirmed that during the repeated rounds of most villages, the investigation did not notice any errors from the veterinarian extension units. The errors occurred as a result of the wrong vaccination of cows by some veterinary technicians from outside the directorate of Agriculture.

[LSD, an OIE-listed capripox virus disease of cattle, was initially suspected to be circulating in Syria in July 2012 when the disease emerged in Israel, on the Syrian border (ProMED-mail archive no. 20120728.1218484). In 2013 and 2016, Syria was suspected as the source of LSD entering Lebanon (20131109.2047088 and 20160724.4365199, respectively).

Syria's "immediate notification" to the OIE, reporting LSD, was submitted 30 Jul 2019; the start of the event indicated as 1 Jul 2019 (https://tinyurl.com/ujpcsu6). In fact, the disease must have been circulating in Syria since 2013 or even earlier; see commentary in 20190725.6585523 and OIE's global map of reported LSD outbreaks, 1 Jan 2013 - 30 Jun 2019, at https://tinyurl.com/uwhncs8 (click on Syria, zoom in to the required resolution; outbreaks are seen in Turkey, Iraq, Jordan, Israel, and Lebanon while absent in Syria).

Israel, Syria's southwestern neighbor, experienced on 30 May 2019 the recurrence of LSD, after its absence since September 2013, in the northern district bordering Syria and Lebanon. A total of 18 LSD outbreaks have been reported between 30 May and 27 Oct 2019 (see summary report to OIE with map at https://tinyurl.com/wkqrgk9). The absence of further spread was attributed to the application of mass vaccination, using the Onderstepoort, S. African Neethling live attenuated vaccine; this vaccine had been earlier found to convey, in dairy cattle, higher protection level against LSD than sheep-pox vaccines.

With temperatures falling, the 2019 LSD season is approaching its termination, regionally.

LSD is not zoonotic. - Mod.AS
