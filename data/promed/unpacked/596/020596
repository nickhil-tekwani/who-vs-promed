Avian influenza has killed a 48-year-old man in
Thailand, the country's 1st human death from the
H5N1 [avian influenza] virus in a year, Prime
Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and health officials
said on Thursday [20 Oct 2005]. Health officials
said the victim was a 48-year-old man in
Kanchanaburi province, which has recently
reported fresh outbreaks of the deadly avian
influenza strain in poultry around 100 km (60
miles) west of the capital, Bangkok.
"The 1st lab results came out negative, but we
tested it several times and confirmed that it was
positive," Thawat Suntrajarn, director general at
the Department of Disease Control told Reuters.
Thaksin and a provincial health official said the
victim appeared to have contracted the disease,
which health experts fear could mutate to unleash
a global killer flu pandemic among humans, from
eating an infected chicken. "The guy was infected
with bird flu because he took a sick chicken,
slaughtered it and then ate it," Thaksin told a
news conference. Thawat said the victim's son,
who had a history of contact with chickens, had
so far not tested positive for the disease.
The H5N1 avian influenza virus, which first
surfaced in Hong Kong in 1997, re-emerged in 2003
in South Korea, and has spread to Viet Nam,
Thailand, Laos, China, Indonesia, Cambodia,
Russia and Europe. More than 60 people have died
from the virus in Asia, including 41 in Viet Nam, the worst-affected country.
The World Health Organisation says southeast Asia
is the most likely epicentre of any possible
human pandemic, which could stem from a mutation
of the virus, making it easily transmittable
between people. Despite continued sporadic animal
infections over the last 12 months, Thailand has
not had any new human cases for a year.

Thai authorities confirmed a new human fatality
from avian influenza on Thursday [20 Oct 2005],
the 1st death in more than a year in the country
from the disease. Prime Minister Thaksin
Shinawatra told a press conference that
laboratory tests results showed H5N1 virus caused
the death of a man in western Kanchanaburi province on Wed 19 Oct 2005.
The latest case was the 13th fatality from avian
influenza in Thailand since the disease first
appeared in 2003. The last previous human death
was recorded in October 2004. Thaksin urged the
country not to panic, saying health officials had
experience in dealing with the problem. He said
authorities would order the culling of poultry in
the area of the newest outbreak.
Some 21 of the country's 76 provinces are
currently under quarantine or under close watch for the H5N1 virus.

Thailand has reported that a farmer has died from
avian influenza, the 1st victim to die in the
Southeast Asian nation in more than a year, as EU
officials take action to halt its spread in
Europe. The 48-year-old farmer was the 13th
person to die in Thailand, and takes the death
toll in Asia since 2003 to more than 60 [61 if
confirmed by WHO]. He contracted the virus after
slaughtering and eating an infected chicken.
Also in Asia, Taiwan's Council of Agriculture
said Thursday it had found birds infected with
the lethal H5N1 flu in a container smuggled from
China, the first case on the island since late
2003. Taiwanese coastguards seized the
Panama-registered cargo on 14 Oct 2005, and tests
confirmed about 1000 birds were infected with the
H5N1 virus, Reuters quoted an official as saying.
On Wed 19 Oct 2005, China's official Xinhua news
agency reported 2600 birds had been found dead of
the H5N1 strain in the country's northern
grasslands, according to The Associated Press.
The H5N1 strain, which first surfaced in Hong
Kong in 1997, re-emerged in 2003 in South Korea,
and has spread to Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, China,
Indonesia, Cambodia, Russia and Europe. Most of
the human deaths have been linked to contact with
sick birds. But experts say the virus could
re-assort or mutate into a form that can be
transmitted between humans, triggering a global pandemic.
With the bird flu virus encroaching on Europe,
health ministers from 25 EU nations are scheduled
to meet near London on Thursday [20 Oct 2005] to
talk about how to keep the virus from jumping to
humans, and how to respond if it does. Adding to
the worry is confirmation from Russia's
agriculture ministry that the deadly H5N1 strain
of the virus has been found in poultry south of
Moscow. While further tests are needed to confirm
the finding and determine whether it is the same
H5N1 strain that has decimated stocks in Asia,
the discovery in the Tula region, 200 kilometers
(125 miles) south of Moscow, would mark the 1st
time the lethal strain has appeared in European
Russia, west of the Ural Mountains. It suggests
the virus might be spreading from Siberia to the shores of the Mediterranean.
Tests confirmed the H5N1 avian influenza in a 2nd
location in Romania's eastern Danube Delta
region, a government official said Wednesday [19
Oct 2005]. Romanian authorities have killed all
farm birds in the area and finished disinfecting
the areas, including people's houses and yards.
In Brussels, a European Union official said there
is a suspicion of bird flu in Macedonia. Samples
from a dead bird were sent from Macedonia to
London for testing after a large number of birds
died in the city of Bitola near the border with
Greece, a member of Macedonia's parliament said
Tuesday. The disease has already affected birds
in at least 2 other European countries, Romania
and Greece, as well as neighboring Turkey. A ban
on poultry imports from Turkey and Romania was
introduced on 10 Oct 2005. EU officials said they
were preparing to extend a ban on imports of pet
birds and feathers from Siberia because of the
bird flu. Health officials said they will also
hold a simulation exercise of a flu pandemic by
the end of 2005 to improve preparedness.
However, the EU's disease control agency
downplayed fears of bird flu spreading to humans
on the continent. The agency gave 2 tips for
people to minimize the risk of infection: do not
touch dead or sick birds, and eat only well-cooked eggs or poultry.
Greek authorities began Wednesday the systematic
disinfection of a farm on a remote Aegean Sea
island where a lone turkey was found to be
infected with the H5N1 strain. The sample was
sent to Britain late Tuesday and the full results
are expected to be ready in about a week, though
an announcement could come sooner. EU spokesman
Philip Tod said the EU executive would send
experts to Greece to help identify the bird flu strain there.
Late on Tuesday, Bulgaria banned the imports of
live fowl, poultry products and eggs from Greece,
as well as the transportation of poultry loads
that have passed through the territories of
Turkey, Greece, and Romania. Greece has banned
the export of live birds and poultry products
from Aegean Sea islands neighboring Oinouses, and
said it would keep the measures in force until
the results from the British laboratory were known.
EU foreign ministers on Tuesday declared the
spread of bird flu from Asia into Europe a
"global threat" requiring international action.
The meeting issued a statement saying bird flu
posed a serious, global health threat if it
shifted from birds to humans and one that
required "a coordinated international reaction."
European Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou
told reporters that because the flu may be
carried by migratory birds, other European
countries could experience outbreaks. He warned
that the 25 EU member countries do not have
enough anti-viral drugs on hand to fight a human pandemic.
The World Health Organization recommends that
governments hold in reserve sufficient anti-viral
drugs to treat 25 per cent of their populations.
Kyprianou said "more than half" of the EU
countries are not yet prepared. Swiss drug maker
Roche, pressed to raise output of antiviral flu
drug Tamiflu, said it would consider allowing
rival firms and governments to produce it under
licence for emergency pandemic use. A Dutch
company said it was working on a vaccine.
Besides the human danger, countries visited by
bird flu in its various forms can face grave
economic losses. The milder H5N7 strain struck
the Netherlands in 2003, prompting slaughter of
30 million birds and losses estimated at 500 million euros [USD 600 million].

Avian influenza � situation in Thailand � update 35 20 Oct 2005
-------------------------
The Ministry of Public Health in Thailand has
today confirmed its 1st case of human infection
with H5N1 avian influenza since 8 October of last
year [2004]. The patient, a 48-year old man from
Kanchanaburi Province, developed symptoms on 13
Oct [2005], was hospitalized on 17 Oct [2005], and died on 19 Oct [2005].
Authorities have linked his infection to close
contact with diseased poultry during slaughter.
Poultry outbreaks in several Kanchanaburi
villages were reported earlier this month.
Samples from the patient will be sent for further
analysis at a WHO reference laboratory.
The man�s 7-year-old son developed respiratory
symptoms on 16 Oct [2005]. He had assisted his
father with defeathering of the diseased birds.
Test results on the child, who is presently hospitalized, are pending.
Since the start of the outbreaks in Asia,
Thailand has confirmed 18 cases, of which 13 have been fatal.

[The patient was treated for severe pneumonia and
initially tested negative for H5N1 avian
influenza virus infection, as did his 7-year-old
son, who was treated for a milder respiratory
tract infection. The son has remained
H5N1-negative, whereas the victim tested
H5N1-positive on repeat testing. The deceased
becomes the 61st fatality in East Asia, and the
1st in Thailand for more than a year.
However, this case should be regarded as a
suspected case of avian H5N1 influenza until the
diagnosis has been confirmed independently by
laboratory testing at the WHO-designated
reference laboratory in Hong Kong. - Mod.CP]
