In the last 4 years, the incidence of classical dengue and DHF in the
country has shot up 800 percent, from 6400 in 2003 to 48 000 in 2007,
said the secretary of Health Jose Angel Cordova Villalobos, who set
the National Plan for Prevention and Control of Dengue in motion.

The federal official indicated that 80 percent of this infection,
transmitted by the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_, is concentrated in the
southeast of the country, mainly in Veracruz and Chiapas.

He specified that dengue cases have increased in the country, and
that in 2007 there were outbreaks in 28 states, with 10 deaths.

Mauricio Hernandez Avila, sub secretary of prevention and health
promotion added that this year [2008] 1380 dengue cases have been
counted of which 1059 were classical dengue and 321 were DHF, which
can be fatal. Moreover, 95 percent of the cases were detected in 16
places. "There have not been any deaths so far in 2008, and the death
rate is less than one percent, which reflects the quality of the care
provided to infectious [disease cases]", he indicated.

The secretary of health said that all 4 dengue [virus] serotypes have
been detected in Mexico, which increases the possibility of DHF
outbreaks.

Statistics from the Secretariat of Health revealed that the situation
in Veracruz is critical, where during 2007, 12 000 [dengue] cases
were registered, whereas in 2006 the figure was 8000.

In recent months the problem has increased in states where [dengue]
has practically not been [previously] detected, such as Coahuila and
Nuevo Leon. In Tamaulipas during the past year [2007] 70 cases were
confirmed, 15 of them DHF.

A year ago, the Canadian government issued an alert for their
citizens to avoid visiting Cancun, Puerto Vallarta, and Acapulco due
to the high incidence of dengue. On that occasion, Cordova Villalobos
acknowledged that the situation was "worrisome" and explained that
the warning was due to a Canadian who visited Puerto Vallarta,
Jalisco, and died of dengue.

The weekly number of cases of clinically suspected dengue is still
above the epidemic threshold (about 20 cases per week). The number of
laboratory confirmed cases is constant (around 8 cases). A new
laboratory confirmed case was hospitalized during the 10th
epidemiological week [week of 9 Mar 2008].

Since the beginning of the pre-alert in mid-November [2007], it is
estimated that more than 400 people have gone to a general
practitioner physician for a syndrome compatible with dengue. During
the same period, 6 adults with severe forms [of dengue] have been
hospitalized.

Since December 2007, the [dengue virus] serotype most often
identified has been DEN-1. Nevertheless, the [virus] serotype DEN-2
also circulates.

The number of clinically suspected [dengue] cases observed in the
past few weeks has not continued to decline and remains higher than
the epidemic threshold (35 cases estimated). However, no laboratory
confirmed cases have been identified. Nor have there been any
laboratory confirmed hospitalizations since January [2008].

Since the beginning of the epidemic (2nd week of November [2007]),
there have been 1900 estimated total clinically suspected [dengue]
cases. Over the same period, the number of hospitalizations for
laboratory confirmed dengue was 17, including 12 adults (of which 8
were serious forms [of dengue]) and 5 children (with only common
[dengue] forms).

Monitoring has detected dengue [virus] serotype DEN-1 since
mid-November [2007].

So far this year [2008], 30 persons have been diagnosed with dengue
fever in the Central Borough of Chaguanas. Efforts to combat the
spread of the disease through spraying to control the carrier, _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquito, by personnel of the Chaguanas Borough Corporation
has been stymied by a shortage of the herbicide malathion.

An official at the Corporation told Newsday that spraying was done in
3 cycles with the ULV machines last month [February 2008] in places
deemed "hot spot areas", which are areas within a quarter mile radius
of where dengue cases have been found.

However, spraying has stopped due to a scarcity of the chemical.
Attempts were being made up to yesterday [11 Mar 2008] to obtain the
chemical, following which spraying will resume. This is the latest
report of an outbreak of the disease.

Chaguanas mayor Suruj Rambachan expressed deep concern over the
situation and called on the Local Government Ministry to provide
funding to not only buy malathion but also retain perifocal officers
on contract. Rambachan also revealed that he is investigating claims
that a person had died from dengue fever.

"The Borough of Chaguanas has over 35 000 houses and perifocal
officers should visit these homes once every 6 months, but we don't
have any officers at the moment. The Insect Vector Unit does not have
enough officers," Rambachan said.

He added that a barrel of malathion costs an estimated USD 7000 and 6
barrels are needed by the Corporation immediately. In January [2008],
Rambachan stated the Corporation spent USD 13 000 to purchase 2
barrels of Malathion to spray certain areas in Chaguanas to prevent
the spread of dengue.

Meanwhile, the Health Ministry's Insect Vector Unit will be embarking
on a spraying and cleaning exercise in the Freeport area in light of
reported cases of dengue fever afflicting 7 officers of the Central
Division Highway Patrol Unit based at Freeport Police station.

Over the past few months, several areas such as St Augustine,
Tunapuna, Piarco, and Port-of-Spain had to be sprayed following
reported cases of dengue. In January [2008], 11 Chinese construction
workers residing in Port-of-Spain had to be hospitalised after they
were reportedly afflicted with dengue.

Eastern Regional Health Authority CEO Ronald Tsoi-a-Fatt said there
were 2 confirmed cases of dengue fever in March [2008] from Rio
Claro. Arima Borough Corporation councillor Ricardo Bharath said: "Up
to the last time a public health meeting was held in February [2008],
there were no confirmed cases of dengue." However, the Corporation is
planning to embark on a USD 350 000 clean-up drive where they will be
focusing on spraying in Arima and environs.

Health Ministry communications specialist Jones P Madeira said there
were no unusual cases reported with "sporadic cases of dengue
reported across the country." Earlier this year [2008] chief medical
officer Rohit Doon said there were 108 confirmed dengue cases
reported in the 1st 7 weeks of the year.

[The clean-up dive, assuming that it is focused on elimination of
_Aedes aegypti_ breeding sites, is likely to be a more effective
long-term dengue virus transmission preventive measure than spraying.
Spraying will provide short-term reduction of adults, and reduce
transmission, but new adults will emerge from breeding sites that
remain.

Dengue killed one more child in Rio, according to the Municipal
Secretary of Health. A 6-year-old boy who lived in Senator Camara,
died last Sunday [9 Mar 2008], with DHF. This case brings to 20 the
number of [dengue] deaths reported in the municipality of Rio. Of
those victims, 11 were children and one an adolescent.

A case of dengue recorded in a newborn baby led the Ministry of Health
to investigate a baby who had contracted the disease through the
placenta while still in the uterus of the mother. The infant, only 5
days old, presented with rash and fever. According to doctors, the
mother of the baby did not know she had the disease [infection] at
the end of her pregnancy. The baby was discharged on Wednesday [12
Mar 2008] from the Institute Fernandes Figueira, in Botafogo. But
there are other possible causes [for this case]. Researchers from the
Oswaldo Cruz Foundation [laboratory] said that the baby may have been
bitten by the mosquito [vector]. According to the Secretariat, so far
this year [2008], 63 cases of dengue in pregnant women have been
reported.

Another case was reported was in Angra dos Reis, in the region of
Costa Verde, and this is also being investigated. According to the
state Secretariat of Health, transmission [to the fetus] via the
placenta is rare but possible. This information is in a booklet that
is being prepared by the Secretariat and will provide guidance to
physicians on the medical care of pregnant [women].

Thus far in 2008, 2 children have died of DHF and these cases are
under investigation. This is the same [number of deaths] registered
during all of 2007.

According to Evandro Melo, the director-president of the Foundation
for Health Surveillance (SVM), the deaths occurred in children aged 7
years. The cases were recorded in the 1st 2 months of the year.
According to SVM records, the children who died lived in [the capital]
Manaus and there have been no suspected cases in the interior of the
state.

The data on the disease recorded by the state Secretary of Health
will be released today [14 Mar 2008] in the summary of operation
"Impact" combating dengue. The operation started 2 weeks ago and is
being carried out in partnership with the fire department and the

The number of registered dengue cases in New Caledonia this year has
passed 200.

Despite efforts to contain the spread of the mosquito-borne disease,
the number of cases has grown 3-fold in less than 3 weeks.

Most of the cases have been found in the Noumea area.

In late February [2008] the pre-epidemic status was upgraded and
awareness campaigns were stepped up.

In 2003, as many as 20 people in New Caledonia died of dengue fever.

<http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/regions/view/20080312-124284/UPDATE-Dengue-outbreak-declared-in-Zamboanga>


The city government has declared a dengue outbreak following a sharp
increase in the number of people afflicted by the mosquito-borne
disease during the last 3 months.

Based on records from the city health office, 406 dengue cases had
been monitored from January up to 11 Mar [2008]; 2 deaths had been
recorded. Mayor Celso Lobregat said before a local health summit here
on Tuesday [11 Mar 2008] that the declaration was made on
recommendation of city health officer Dr Rodelin Agbulos.

"We are declaring a dengue fever outbreak in Zamboanga City and we
have directed the City Health Office (CHO) to source out a contingency
budget for fumigation, which is about PHP 300 000 [USD 7224],"
Lobregat said.

He called on village officials and residents to cooperate to fight the
menace. "Barangay [neighborhood] officials and the committee on health
have to be very active because this campaign cannot be done by the
City Health office alone or even efforts from City Hall or city
government officials, we need all the support from everyone," Lobregat
said.

He said among the immediate measures taken was a citywide cleanup
drive. Dengue-carrying mosquitoes lay their [eggs that hatch into]
larvae in [both] clean [and] stagnant waters.

Agbulos said the target of the cleanup drive are villages, where the
incidence of dengue was exceptionally high. Agbulos confirmed the
sharp increase in the number of dengue cases reported to the CHO
during the past weeks. He said in 2007, there were only 90 cases
monitored from January to 5 Mar, compared to the
same period this year [2008], which has 386 cases already. "It's
alarming (but) we are trying to do everything to control (the spread
of the disease)," he said.

The declaration of an outbreak was the 2nd for the city since 2005,
when dengue cases shot up to 610 over a 6-month period.

Department of Health (DOH) [Region] 7 recorded a total of 1045 dengue
cases admitted to different hospitals from 1 Jan to 1 Mar [2008].
Within these 2 months, at least 25 died of dengue fever in Central
Visayas.

The Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit (Resu) estimated the
case [fatality] rate to be about 76 percent higher than in the same
period last year [2007], when there were only 594 cases with 7 deaths
in the region.

Most of the patients were 6-10 years old, although a 5-month-old baby
was recorded as the youngest and a 74-year-old adult as the oldest
cases. Resu also recorded an equal number of male and female patients.

Cebu City still ranks 1st in the top 10 list of municipalities and
cities with a high number of dengue cases in Region 7, with its 251
cases and 10 deaths. In the same period last year [2007] , there were
only 168 cases and 2 deaths in the city.

However, according to the City Epidemiology Statistics and
Surveillance Unit, the City already documented 408 cases with 12
deaths as of 1 Mar [2008]. This is about 172 percent higher compared
to the figures from the same period last year [2007].

Last year [2007], the dengue virus hit 2107 Cebu City residents, 51
of whom died. This number was 120 percent higher than in 2006, when
only 957 cases and 27 deaths were recorded.

City Hall already recorded 234 cases in January [2008] and 174 last
month [February 2008]. In 2007, it only recorded 69 cases for January
and 81 for February.

City Hall's Anti-Dengue Task Force plans to mobilize the massive
spraying of anti-dengue chemicals in Barangay Inayawan this week in
close coordination with
the City Health Department.

Meanwhile, dengue cases in other cities in Central Visayas also
doubled. Residents are urged to help prevent it by ridding their
homes and surroundings of open receptacles where water may gather and
mosquitoes breed.

Thailand's Public Health Ministry will kick off a campaign to kill
striped mosquitoes [_Aedes aegypti_] nationwide in an attempt to
fight the alarming increase of dengue fever patients, according to
senior ministry officials.

Public health minister Chaiya Sasomsup said this year's [2008] dengue
fever outbreak in Thailand was quite worrying. From 1 Jan-8 Mar
[2008], a total of 5837 dengue fever patients were recorded
nationwide, 7 of whom died from the disease. Compared to the same
period of 2007, the number of patients this year [2008] was 77 percent
higher. The ministry has decided therefore to launch a nationwide
campaign to raise public awareness as well as to eradicate striped
mosquitoes, which carry dengue fever [virus].

Between 20-27 Mar [2008], a total of 800 000 health volunteers will
cooperate with local administration officials in conducting a
door-to-door campaign in villages to promote the eradication of the
mosquitoes and their habitats.

Director-general of Thailand's Disease Control Department, Dr Thawat
Suntrajarn, said the density of the disease had shifted from the
southern region to the central region. During the 1st 10 weeks of
this year [2008], a total of 3669 patients were found in the central
region, compared with 1105 in the southern region. In previous years,
more patients were recorded in the southern region.
