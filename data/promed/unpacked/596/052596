Panama: Death of Second Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome Patient
--------------------------------------------------
A 22-year-old patient from the community of Guanico Arriba, district of
Tonosi, died as a result of hantavirus infection on Wed 25 Sep 2002, in the
Joaquin Pablo Franco Hospital of Las Tablas. Pedro Rios, Regional Director
of Health from the province of Los Santos confirmed this yesterday,
pointing out that this was the second case of hantavirus [pulmonary
syndrome] reported in the district of Tonosi in less than 10 days. He
mentioned that in the preceding week there was a report of a 30-year-old
patient [with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome] from the community of Agua
Buena, part of Canas, who was in stable condition.
Hantaviruses are transmitted primarily through inhalation of small dried
fresh particles contaminated with feces, urine, and/or saliva of rodents.
In total, since the first identification of hantavirus infection in Panama
in 1999, there have been 38 cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
reported, of which 7 have died.
The situation in Tonosi is worrisome, because studies from the Gorgas
Memorial Institute have demonstrated an increase in the number of rodents
in this district and have detected a new species of rodent that is
contaminated with hantavirus, according to Rios.

[The hantaviruses are a diverse and numerous group of viruses belonging to
the family _Bunyaviridae_. Hantaviruses differ from other members of the
_Bunyaviridae_ in that they are not transmitted by arthropods. Certain
species are the aetiological agents of haemorrhagic fever with renal
syndrome (predominantly in the Eastern hemisphere) and others with
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (predominantly in the Western hemisphere).
The hosts of hantaviruses are primarily rodents, and the different
hantavirus species are usually associated with a single rodent species.
Human infection is incidental to virus maintenance and almost always a
dead-end, with exception of the South American _Andes virus_, which has
exhibited human-to-human transmission. The present report does not identify
the hantavirus species responsible for these cases of hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome in Panama. Previously, 2 hantaviruses have been isolated in
Panama: Choclo virus (reservoir host - _Oligoryzomys fulvescens_) and
Calabazo virus (reservoir host - _Zygodontomys brevicauda_); only the
former has been associated with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. (see :Levis
et al., Journal of Infectious Diseases 177: 529-538, 1998; and Vincent et
al., Virology 277:14-19, 2000). Further information on the identity of the
hantavirus and rodent host implicated in the current outbreak would be
welcomed. - Mod.CP]
