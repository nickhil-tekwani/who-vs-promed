A "Situation Report" on the yellow fever outbreak in Darfur jointly released by the Sudanese federal Ministry of Health and by the World Health Organisation (WHO) asserted that 171 people have died of the disease in the region as of 9 Jan [2013]. The report also indicated that 849 suspected cases of yellow fever have been reported in Darfur since 2 Sep 2012. Additionally, the case fatality rate (CFR) of the disease is suspected to be 20.1 per cent.

Information suggests that 35 out of the 64 localities of Darfur have been affected by the disease. Central Darfur is reportedly still the most affected state with 51.5 per cent of the registered cases. It is followed by North Darfur (21 per cent), West Darfur (17.4 per cent) and South Darfur (9.5 per cent).

East Darfur is not mentioned in this calculation, being allegedly the least affected state with 0.6 per cent of the diagnosed cases based on the percentage provided above.

So far, 1.1 million people have been vaccinated against yellow fever in Darfur.

The 2nd phase of the campaign covered 95 per cent of South Darfur's targeted population, 87 per cent of West Darfur, and 86 per cent of Central Darfur, the joint statement announced.

For the campaign's 3rd phase, the WHO recommends the inclusion of 2 million people residing in the following areas: Kabkabiya, Edd Elfursan (including Kabum locality), Elwihda, Shaeriya (including Yassin locality), El-Daen, Rokiro and Umm Dukhun.

"The 1st vaccine shipment of 670 400 doses is scheduled to arrive in Sudan on 14 Jan [2013], while the 2nd shipment of 702 000 doses and 3rd shipment of 827 600 doses will be delivered shortly afterwards."

A total of 1754 blood samples were collected from different zones of Sudan and sent to a virologist from Institute Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal to analyze the material. He is reportedly working at the National Public Health Laboratory in Khartoum.

[It is good to see that the 3rd phase of the yellow fever (YF) vaccination campaign is proceeding and apparently will be completed by the end of this month (January 2013). The armed conflict in North Darfur has intensified in the past 2 weeks, and several thousand people have been displaced. One hopes that this unfortunate situation does not result in spread of YF virus. Intensive, proactive surveillance throughout Darfur is necessary to verify the ministry's declaration that the outbreak has ended. Providing that level of surveillance in the areas of armed conflict will be difficult. It is curious that although the outbreak was 1st reported on 2 Sep 2012, the vaccination and vector control campaign was not launched until November 2012.
