At the beginning of October a 59-year-old woman from the northern town of
Olsztyn died from rabies after being infected by a cat, the first rabies
fatality in Poland in 14 years.
More than 200 rabies cases have been registered in animals in the
southern Polish region of Podkarpacie since the beginning of the year,
mostly in foxes, the local veterinary service reported.
Rabies cases have more than doubled from the 80 registered last year,
according to veterinarian Andrzej Kloczkowski.
To combat the disease some 10 000 doses of oral vaccine have been dropped
by plane over the area in which some 6000 foxes, the most frequent
carriers of the deadly disease, are believed to live.
