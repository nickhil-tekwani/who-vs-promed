Manufacturer Medical Packaging Technologies Inc. is expanding the product
recall initiated on 28 Feb 2001 by Chester Labs, to include additional lots
of System TLC 4 oz Mouth Rinse, product number 535-4. The recall has been
expanded to include the following lot numbers: 0049001, 0049002, 0053003,
0054004, 0055005, 0056006, 0060007, and 0131009. Chester Labs is contacting
all distributors that may have received these lot numbers. Lot number
0049001 is being recalled due to contamination with _Burkholderia cepacia_.
The product presents a serious adverse health situation, as infections from
these bacteria are difficult to treat, and can be associated with high
morbidity and mortality rates, especially in immunocompromised hospital
patients. The other lot numbers are being recalled because they do not meet
the manufacturer's product specifications.
A nationwide press release will be issued. This action is being taken with
the knowledge of the Food & Drug Administration.

individual bottle.
2. Fill out and promptly mail or fax to Chester Labs the enclosed prepaid
postcard [not included by ProMED-mail. FAX # 1-800-235-3995. Reports
indicating NO stock of these lots are just as important as positive reports
