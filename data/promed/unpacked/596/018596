There have been several reported cases of tularemia or rabbit fever, known as 'harpest' in Sweden, this summer [2019], mostly in the north and centre of the country.

The animals most likely to carry the disease are wild hares, hence the name rabbit fever, and rodents, but it can also be transferred to humans via mosquito bites and occasionally tick bites. It's also possible for the infection to be transmitted by inhaling dust or drinking water that is contaminated by urine or feces from animals with the disease, according to Swedish healthcare service 1177. The disease cannot be carried from human to human.

It is too early to measure the exact extent of the disease this year [2019], since statistics from the Public Health Agency won't be available until later. But the Swedish Veterinary Institute has warned of several findings of dead animals that had been infected with the disease, and a "suspected outbreak".

A total of 33 people in the Gavleborg region have been affected by rabbit fever since the start of July [2019], according to regional healthcare authorities. In most cases, the patients had been infected in the Ljusdal area, and one case related to a patient who became sick after cleaning out a barn.

At least 12 people have been affected by rabbit fever in the Dalarna region alone, a doctor in communicable diseases told SVT Dalarna, and he said the figure was expected to increase.

"It looks like there will be a lot of cases this year [2019], more than last year [2018]," doctor Anders Lindblom said, adding: "Not everyone [who is affected by rabbit fever] seeks medical care and reports the illness."

At least a further 5 people have confirmed cases of rabbit fever in Norrbotten too. Sweden had a large outbreak of rabbit fever in 2015, when 859 people across the country suffered from the illness, the majority of them in Norrbotten and Vasterbotten. In 2018, 107 cases were reported across Sweden, with Dalarna the most severely affected region.

Symptoms of rabbit fever typically begin with swelling or tenderness in the lymph node and a skin lesion at the site of any bite or direct contact, followed occasionally by symptoms that can include a skin rash, nausea, and headaches.

The best way to protect yourself from infection is to avoid mosquito bites as much as possible (either by using repellents, or wearing long, loose clothing when going outside between dusk and dawn), and being especially careful if you need to touch a dead animal such as a rodent or hare, using precautions such as a face mask and gloves.

[_Francisella tularensis_ subsp. _tularensis_ (Type A) is associated with lagomorphs (rabbits and hares). Wild rodents are also frequently infected, and occurrence of human cases is usually linked to these host species. _F. tularensis_ is transmitted primarily by ticks and biting flies, and is highly virulent for humans and domestic rabbits.

Tularemia is largely confined to the Northern Hemisphere and is not normally found in the tropics or the Southern Hemisphere. _F. tularensis_ subspecies _holarctica_ naturally infects several mammalian wildlife species in northern Europe, in particular, mice, rabbits, hares, beavers, voles, lemmings, and muskrats. The ticks _Dermacentor reticularis_ and _Ixodes ricinus_ are vectors for the bacterium, although previous research has suggested that mosquito bites are the most frequent route of transmission to humans in Sweden.

In addition to vector transmission, tularemia may be spread via contact with infected animals or environmental fomites by inhalation, or by ingestion of the poorly cooked flesh of infected animals or contaminated water. - Mod.PMB]

[Tularemia can be transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with, or ingestion of, infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbit) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional lymphadenitis), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially [pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage ("stadium") to the next] and transovarially [transmission of a pathogen from an organism (as a tick) to its offspring by infection of eggs in its ovary], making them efficient reservoirs and vectors. - Mod.LL
