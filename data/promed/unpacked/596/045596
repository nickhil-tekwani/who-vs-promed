Patients with scrub typhus are increasing in Bajura district in recent months. According to Bajura District Hospital, 28 cases of scrub typhus have been detected so far in the district since Asar. [Asar is the 3rd month in the Bikram Samvat, the official Nepali calendar, and coincides with 15 Jun to 16 Jul of the Western calendar (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashadh_(Nepali_calendar))].

The cases were detected after testing patients who had come to the hospital for treatment, and there is a high possibility that scrub patients are also in other health facilities of the district, informed Dr. Prakash Raj Joshi, at the district hospital.

Scrub typhus is an infectious disease caused by a parasite called chigger, primarily found in rats and mice. The mites contract the disease in their larval stage. Thus, the mites are both vectors and reservoirs of the disease.

The most common symptoms of scrub typhus, also referred to as bush typhus, are fever, headache, body ache and rashes, similar to dengue, Dr. Joshi said, while adding that Bajura is also one of the high-risk areas for scrub typhus.

The patients with scrub typhus would likely suffer from continuous fever, headache, sweating, pain in the corner of the eyes, weakness and cough. Patients will start to show rashes in their neck after contracting the disease for 5 to 7 days, which will spread to the other parts of the body, added Dr. Joshi. He urged people to wear full-sleeve clothes and boots, maintain hygiene, keep the surroundings clean and take safety measures to avoid contracting the virus. In case a person is symptomatic, one should immediately visit the health facilities.

The number of scrub typhus cases have gone up with the rise in the temperature, he added, while suggesting clearing the bushes around the houses and avoid coming in contact with rodents.

According to the statistics of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, 8 persons died of scrub typhus last year [2020] while 84 had contracted the disease. However, the number of patients has gone up since then, added doctors.

[The diagnosis of scrub typhus in Nepal has increased since the 2015 earthquake, with 101 cases of scrub typhus in 2015, 831 cases in 2016, and 1435 cases in 2017-2018. This had been attributed to people living in temporary shelters where they might have been exposed to infected chiggers (larval mites), but some of this increase may be due to enhanced surveillance for this disease.

Scrub typhus presents clinically with chills, fever, headache, muscle pain, and sometimes with a macular or maculopapular rash and an eschar at the site of the chigger bite; confirmation requires laboratory testing, usually by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, but this will require a 4-fold rise in antibody titer between acute and convalescent specimens. Results from a single acute serum sample are unreliable, as it takes 7-10 days for IgG antibody to be detectable, and antibody will be present in a high percentage of healthy people in an endemic region, like Nepal. The Weil-Felix test is unreliable (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16941792), and molecular methods like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may not be available in endemic regions. The laboratory method by which the diagnosis of scrub typhus was made in these patients is not stated.

Doxycycline is the drug of choice and it is preferred over other tetracyclines for treatment of scrub typhus; it is rarely associated with staining of teeth in children younger than 8 years (1). Macrolides, such as azithromycin, are also reported to be efficacious (2). Fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, have been reported to be clinically effective in the treatment of scrub typhus in a few patients. However, some clinical studies suggest that fluoroquinolones are not as effective in patients with scrub typhus as other antibiotics (3-5).

Bajura District, with a population of almost 135 000 residents, a part of Sudurpashchim Province, is one of the 77 districts of Nepal (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bajura_District).
