The report from China of this unusual outbreak has just been
published: Hu Wang et al: A Dog-Associated Primary Pneumonic Plague
in Qinghai Province, China. Clin Infect Dis. 2011;52: 185-190.

This was reported by ProMED in 2009 in a thread (see ProMED archives
below) that ended with the report from WHO and a comment by ProMED
that no further information regarding the patient, who was in
critical condition, was available. This paper reports that the
patient survived and that the index patient contracted pneumonic
plague after carrying his dead dog on his shoulders around his neck
for 400 meters to bury it.

It also clarifies statements in the WHO report that could have been
misunderstood to mean that plague had been transmitted from the index
case's corpse. To quote WHO:

"The 1st case was a 32-year-old male herdsman who developed fever and
hemoptysis on 26 Jul 2009. He was referred to a hospital but died en
route and was buried the following day. On 30 Jul 2009, 11 people who
had close contact with the case (mainly relatives who attended the
funeral) developed fever and cough and were all hospitalized. On 1
Aug 2009, specimens taken from all these 12 people, including the 1st
case, tested positive for plague. On 2 Aug 2009, both the 64-year-old
father-in-law of the index case and a 37-year-old male neighbor of
the 1st case (who helped to bury the corpse) also died."

The Chinese authors defined a close contact as "a person who lived
with or had face-to-face contact (within one meter) with the patient,
and a direct contact as a person who once was together with a patient
in the same room or in the same car with closed windows."

Only the 11 close contacts became infected; none of 61 direct
contacts became infected, and nobody who attended the funeral but had
not previously been a close contact became infected. They also
reported that most of the patients (6 of 11, excluding the index
case) in this outbreak developed septicemic plague complicated with
shock; 2 of 11 developed multiple organ failure, and one of 11
developed meningitis in addition to the plague pneumonia.

[What is also noteworthy regarding this cluster of pneumonic plague
is the source, a dog, that was likely infected from a marmot, the
most common reservoir in China. - Mod.LL]
