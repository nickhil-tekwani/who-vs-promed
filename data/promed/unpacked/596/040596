Anthrax causes death of a rhinoceros in a zoo of India
------------------------------------------------------
One adult male rhinoceros died yesterday [22 Jan 2008] while suffering from
anthrax. Although initial microscopical examination of different tissue
showed _Bacillus_ spp. similar to anthrax bacilli. However, other
investigations are now going on by a high-level investigation committee.
In the morning the animal showed abnormal behaviors, he ran continuously
and then died suddenly with evidences of bleedings from nose, mouth and
anus. All animals in the zoo and in a 2 km radius adjoining area are now
being vaccinated against anthrax.

Assam zoo rhino dies of possible anthrax, alert sounded
-------------------------------------------------------
A full grown rhino at a zoo here died Tuesday [22 Jan 2008] of "suspected
anthrax", forcing wildlife authorities to sound an alert and take steps to
save other animals at the sprawling facility, authorities said.
"The 30 year old male rhino died at its enclosure this morning, and based
on microscopic and clinical observations, veterinarians have said it could
be a case of suspected anthrax," Guwahati Zoo warden Narayan Mahanta told
IANS. Mahanta, however, clarified that a conclusive picture would emerge
after microbiological test reports are received after 72 hours. "We are not
taking chances and have therefore buried the rhino carcass without any
postmortem to prevent the possible spread of the disease, and have burnt
the surface of the enclosure where the animal died," Mahanta said.
Assam Forest and Environment Minister Rockybl Hussain reviewed the
situation and has decided to vaccinate all animals at the zoo in Guwahati
after taking expert advice. "The rhino was in seemingly good shape till
yesterday. We were taken by surprise when it started bleeding this morning,
a clinical sign of it being afflicted by possible anthrax," Mahanta said.
Zoo authorities have put 5 other rhinos at the premises under "close
observation".

ProMED-mail rapporteur Brent Barrett
[The case history as presented in these 2 reports is indicative and typical
of acute death from anthrax. It is listed as "suspect" until there is
confirmation. Also as it was an animal in an enclosed zoological garden one
might presume that it got infected via contaminated feed of some kind. In
which case other animals and maybe even other species in the zoo are
already at risk. Considering the popular value placed on rhino horns one
must hope that the burial site is in a secure place. Otherwise one can
confidently expect it to be disturbed, and a risk both to the
resurrectionists and to the environment around the grave.
The Great Indian Rhinoceros, _Rhinoceros unicornis_, is found in India,
Bhutan, and Nepal in wildlife sanctuaries in the sub-Himalayan belt -- in
the Brahmaputra valley in Assam (where the largest population of Rhinos
worldwide exists in Kaziranga National Park), in the Chitwan valley in
Nepal, and in lowland Bhutan. It is found in marshy lowlands. Tall grass,
thick forests, and swamps are rhino territory. The rhino spends a
significant amount of time during the day, wallowing in mud or marshy
pools. It feeds on grass, leaves, and twigs. It usually feeds in the
morning and evening and spends the hot daytime cooling off in a mud wallow.
The prehensile upper lip of the rhino helps it in feeding. The Indian
rhinoceros is an endangered species. The pressure of human populations on
the last remaining habitats of the rhinoceros, poaching for the sake of its
horn, and tiger predation of its calves are threats to its continued
survival in the wild.

Reports of anthrax in rhinos are infrequent if not rare. ProMED-mail has 2,
see below, which includes one reported retrospectively in the Gorumara
Forest area after a gaur was found to have died of the disease.
There are only 3 papers in the literature covering this disease in rhinos
and then only incidentally:
