Brucellosis finding worries cattlemen
--------------------------
BOISE, Idaho -- Red flags are in the air over recent findings of
brucellosis in a cattle herd in Fremont County. The Idaho State
Department of Agriculture's (ISDA) office of the state veterinarian
released information on 19 Apr 2002 that a small cattle herd in the
county tested positive to the contagious bacterial disease.
The disease was detected as a result of routine blood tests conducted
on cattle in the area, said Sara Braasch, executive vice president of
the Idaho Cattlemen's Association (ICA). ICA is working closely with
the state Department of Agriculture to monitor the situation.
"Because these cattle herds are very near the Greater Yellowstone,
they are tested on a routine basis for brucellosis," Braasch said.
Cattle herds in close proximity to infected wildlife are at greater
risk for contracting the disease. Wildlife species such as bison,
elk, caribou, reindeer, and wild swine can carry the disease.
Brucellosis has been confirmed in a free-ranging elk herd in the
Yellowstone area. Brucellosis is not a word cattle producers like to
hear. Idaho has fought a hard fight to eradicate a disease causing
animals to abort.
In 1983 the state mandated the vaccination of all female cattle 1
year old and younger. Several years later, as a result of the
calfhood vaccination program, Idaho was declared brucellosis-free.
In the Fremont County case, the at-risk herd has been tested
annually. Braasch said "6 beef cows were positive reactors to the
test. All had been calfhood-vaccinated, and some had been given
booster shots." The test may also have been a reaction to the live
brucellosis vaccine the cattle received. The definitive proof will be
the milk tissue test, which takes about 3 weeks before the results
are returned, Braasch said.
The ISDA is conducting an investigation that will identify and test
all herds having had contact with the quarantined herd. The intent is
to determine the extent and origin of infection.
The economic consequences of brucellosis can hugely impact the
livestock industry. Calf production is reduced in affected herds
because females typically abort their first pregnancy. Infections
reduce herd fertility, and milk production is reduced in affected
dairy herds. In addition, losing the brucellosis-free status can
affect cattle trade.
Brucellosis can affect people and is known as undulant fever in
humans. Consumers of unpasteurized milk and other dairy product made
from unpasteurized milk are at high risk for contracting the disease.
If properly cooked, meat from infected animals is not a health risk
to humans.
"Appropriate measures have been taken to isolate the apparently
affected animals so there is no cause for concern about safety of
meat and milk products produced in Idaho," said Bob Hillman, DVM,
state veterinarian.
"ICA appreciates the fact the state has moved quickly on the
situation," Braasch said. "Our markets for cattle should not be
negatively affected."
Braach said depopulation of the contaminated animals is a strong
possibility. But, she added, owners will be compensated for their
losses.

[Brucellosis in cattle is caused by _Brucella abortus_, which can
infect wildlife as well. Without eradication the state could loose
its Brucellosis-free status, which would have economic impacts on the
state. - Mod.TG
