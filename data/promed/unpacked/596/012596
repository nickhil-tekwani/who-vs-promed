The following [edited] remarks have been kindly received from Dr. M.
Letshwenyo, Veterinary Epidemiologist, the Department of Animal
Health and Production (DAHP) in Botswana. They are meant to clarify
some Botswana-related data, included in the posting "Anthrax, human,
livestock - South Africa (NW) (03)" [Mod. AS]:
1. Travellers "advised to use the Pioneer Border Post near Lobatse
until further notice" are those carrying animals or their products.
2. The free annual anthrax vaccinations are carried out in Botswana
during January-March. Hence, the next campaign is due in Jan 2003.
The animals should be fairly protected given the long history of
these vaccinations.
3. Tick control activities and procedures are not a limiting factor
for the timely performance of the annual anthrax vaccinations.
