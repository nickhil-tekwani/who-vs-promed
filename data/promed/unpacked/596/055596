[2] Outbreak and community
- Mon 15 Oct 2018. Beni, North Kivu, becomes the new epicenter of the Ebola outbreak in the east of the country
[Media Congo, in French, machine trans., edited]
https://www.mediacongo.net/article-actualite-43374_beni_devient_le_nouvel_epicentre_de_l_epidemie_de_maladie_a_virus_ebola _a_l_est_du_pays.html

The city of Beni has become the new epicenter of the Ebola outbreak declared on 1 Aug 2018 in North Kivu province of eastern DRC, given the large number of cases observed in this city since 1 Oct 2018, said the National Minister of Health, Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, during a press conference on [Sat 13 Oct 2018], in Kinshasa.

At the beginning of the epidemic, he said, the epicenter was in Mangina where the situation is currently under control. At this press conference, the Minister of Health presented the balance of the Ebola outbreak in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri, where a total of 205 cases have been reported including 170 confirmed cases and 35 probable cases, since 1 Aug 2018. Of the 170 confirmed cases, there were 95 deaths, 54 cures and 21 patients are still on treatment. He said only in Beni, a total of 77 cases including 69 confirmed cases and 8 probable cases have been recorded so far. He said that since the beginning of the epidemic, about 20 healthcare workers have contracted Ebola and 3 of them have died.

According to Minister Oly Ilunga, the large number of cases of this disease in Beni in the last 2 weeks is the result of all the community resistance to hygiene and vaccination observed in that city at the end of August and early September [2018]. He also noted the non-involvement of traditional practitioners in the response. He pointed out that during this period, the conditions for the control of an Ebola epidemic within 4-5 weeks were not met in Beni.

These conditions include case management at treatment sites, safe burial of deceased Ebola patients, identification of patient contacts, vaccination within 48 hours, and follow-up for at least 21 days, in addition to decontamination of contaminated sites. He added to [the challenges in response of the epidemic] the insecurity that prevails in this region where areas under the control of "Mai-Mai" militia are not easily accessible and the lack of human resources. Around a confirmed case of Ebola, he said, there are at least 70 contacts to follow once a day.

Community commitment and law enforcement to control the epidemic
----------------------------------------------------------------
Minister Oly Ilunga praised the behavioral change observed in Beni through the community involvement of the inhabitants in response to the epidemic. He also welcomed the recent decree of the mayor of Beni to maintain order in the city in relation to the response to the Ebola virus disease. Thus, all those who hinder the care of the Ebola patients in this city incur sanctions.

The Minister of Health announced that the Congolese government and its partners have decided to rethink and reframe the plan for the response to the epidemic by taking concerted action around each alert. There is also a focus on Beni, a city subdivided into 18 subcategories for the response. As part of the response in the area of communication, the focus is on social marketing.

- Fri 12 Oct 2018. Background: "Ebola is about human beings and trust"
[Medecins Sans Frontieres/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) interview, edited]
https://www.msf.org/ebola-about-human-beings-and-trust
[Byline: Carl Theunis]

Dr Hilde De Clerck is one of MSF's most experienced Ebola doctors and has been managing outbreaks of Ebola and similar viruses for more than 10 years. Hilde has just returned from North Kivu, in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where the latest outbreak of Ebola has proven hard to control. New drugs, which might help cure those who have contracted the virus, are available, but offering and administering these drugs, says Hilde, is not as easy as it may seem.

When we offer one of the drugs to patients, we talk about the possible benefits but clarify that we cannot guarantee the drug will work; we explain the side-effects but also the risks linked to what we don't know yet about the product. We always make sure the patient, or a family member representing him, has well understood and gives consent.

Sometimes the strength and determination of patients surprises me. I had to explain this to a woman who was very sick and tired, but she opened her eyes, sat up proudly, and signed the consent form. It was honest and I strongly believe she made a conscious decision.

It's very nice to have 5 molecules that seem promising, but we also have to be realistic. There is no scientific evidence that any of these drugs work for people with Ebola. Still, it's a good step forward. We can offer Ebola patients access to potentially lifesaving drugs while preparing for a clinical trial implementation that will hopefully determine efficacy and safety. This is how we advance. But sometimes I have a feeling that the media and even some health staff think that we now have treatment that works. It's really too early to say though.

It remains challenging to give these drugs to the patients. That's one of my main worries. Technically speaking it's not that difficult, but you need to have the capacity and the proper set-up. As it concerns products that are not yet registered, each drug must be administered and monitored following a strict protocol.

This is not so straightforward inside an Ebola treatment centre. You have to move carefully and slowly because of the protective suits you have to wear. You can't see that many patients during your time on the ward. You have to monitor the medical parameters, like temperature, of your patients, make sure they are fed, receive enough to drink, are given their symptomatic medication, and then update their medical records.

This challenge is enormous at the beginning of an epidemic, even without the administration of a new, unregistered drug. We need an army of nurses and hygiene staff -- and we first have to train them all, because most of them will have no experience with Ebola. So I actually find it pretty impressive that the drugs are now systematically offered to all patients.

I can't stress enough how crucial this honesty is. The whole Ebola response is based on mutual trust. It's about building good relationships with families and communities. Otherwise, new patients won't come forward and it becomes very hard to break the chains of transmission. So families of patients can call us at any time. We let them enter the Ebola treatment centre, show them how we take care of their loved ones and they often come to visit. If patients are too sick to walk, we bring them to the visiting zone on a stretcher. You need to be really humane and it's the small details that can make a real difference.

Getting that trust is often difficult at the beginning of an epidemic, when a lot of people die in the Ebola treatment centre. People start to assume that patients are being killed inside or at least are being helped to die. And then there are always the rumours about Westerners or other groups stealing organs or blood, or bringing the disease into the community.

Some people believe the infectious disease is caused by witchcraft. This is nothing new. The best response to this is good health promotion. You go to the people, explain to them what this disease is, how it is transmitted, how it can be managed and how it can be prevented, and be honest and humane.

If you have successful outbreak control and reduce the number of people the virus is transmitted to, then you have fewer patients to treat and can spend more time with the families. Then trust in the community will increase. Of course, if we did have a better treatment, fewer patients would die and trust would also increase.

People in this part of DRC move around a lot. It's important to understand these movements because that is how the virus moves too. We need to understand families and how they are connected; how people seek health care; how their social network functions. Understanding the people is the key to understanding Ebola. And as the Ebola outbreak moves, we have to move too. We have to be flexible. We need to be one step ahead of the outbreak.

Getting this right really depends on your personnel. You need a good health promoter and a good epidemiologist who knows Ebola well. Because it's not just about data, it's about talking with people and being genuinely interested in them. No tool can replace that.

We need to ask the right questions and be empathetic. When I fill out a case investigation form, I write all kinds of additional information around the edges. The whole sheet of paper will be covered. New tools can improve our analysis, but they have to work alongside human insight. It's all about behaviour and human beings and trust.

"I have a feeling that the media and even some health staff think that we now have treatment that works. It's really too early to say though.

[This is a wonderful interview explaining in down to earth language without case numbers and event details, the day to day experience of being on the ground, working on this Ebola outbreak. In addition to understanding the medical condition from a physician's perspective in order to treat the patient, it is also important to understand the human condition from a social science perspective and respond empathetically within the cultural context in the DRC. This discussion elucidates the development of the distrust the community feels. Without regaining that trust, resistance to healthcare workers' efforts builds and the epidemic will continue growing. The responders notably are working on this with community outreach and meetings. This is really a major challenge, and one hopes the community approach will be successful. - Mod.LK]

- Mon 15 Oct 2018. World Health Organization calls crisis meeting over deadly Ebola outbreak in DR Congo
[UN news, edited]
https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/10/1023242

World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has called an Emergency Committee meeting on the Ebola virus outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which has already claimed around 130 lives.

The WHO has assessed the national and regional risk of the current Ebola outbreak in DRC as "very high," although the global risk remains low and, so far, the UN's health watchdog has not called for any trade or travel restrictions to be imposed.

The Emergency Committee, scheduled for [Wed 17 Oct 2018] at WHO headquarters in Geneva, will decide whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern, and what recommendations should be made to manage the spread of the disease.

This outbreak, the 10th to hit the DRC over the last 4 decades, was declared in North Kivu province on 1 Aug 2018 and, based on the worsening security situation in and around the city of Beni, WHO elevated the risk from "high" to "very high" on 28 Sep 2018.

The agency identified 39 new confirmed cases reported between 1 and 11 Oct 2018, 32 of which are from Beni.

The DRC Ministry of Health, WHO, and other partners have been responding to the outbreak with teams on the ground, but WHO has warned that continuing insecurity severely affects both civilians and frontline workers, forcing the suspension of the response for several days in late September, and raising the risk that the virus will continue to spread.

More than 20 civilians in Beni were killed in the incident that provoked the suspension, which came on the heels of multiple attacks in previous weeks. It's estimated by the UN that more than a million civilians under threat from armed groups, are internally-displaced in North Kivu; around 500 000 this year [2018] alone. The eastern region is close to the border with Uganda and Rwanda.

Meanwhile, the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) reports that one month after the beginning of the school year, 80 per cent of school-aged children have returned to school in Beni and Mabalako health zones, the 2 epicentres of the Ebola outbreak. UNICEF has identified more than 1500 schools in the areas affected by the epidemic.

- Tue 16 Oct 2018. WHO weighs whether to declare global health emergency over Congo's Ebola outbreak
[The Japan Times, abridged, edited]
https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/10/16/world/science-health-world/weighs-whether-declare-global-health-emergency-congos-ebola-outbreak/#.W8UsixNKgWo

The World Health Organization said [Mon 15 Oct 2018] its experts will meet this week to determine whether an Ebola outbreak in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo constitutes a global health emergency.

"The committee will meet on 17 Oct 2018 in Geneva to ascertain whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern [PHEIC]," the statement said.

In the WHO's parlance, "a public health emergency of international concern" is an "extraordinary event" in which a disease may spread across borders and requires a vigorous international response.

The agency first invoked the emergency mechanism in 2009 when a new strain of influenza, so-called H1N1 swine flu, emerged. It was also declared twice in 2014, when polio re-emerged after the disease was nearly eradicated, and after an Ebola epidemic struck three West African countries.

Then in 2016, a global emergency was declared in response to an outbreak of the Zika virus.

Monday's [15 Oct 2018] announcement came after DRC Health Minister Oly Ilunga warned over the weekend that a 2nd wave of the Ebola virus had been confirmed in the outbreak in North Kivu, which is home to a clutch of armed groups.

He said the 2nd wave occurred as a result of community resistance to measures taken to tackle the disease, describing the outbreak as "high risk." "The situation is worrying," he said.

Fears and misconceptions about the virus have led to widespread mistrust and resistance to Ebola response workers, including those who come into communities wearing hazmat suits to orchestrate burials.

A staff member of the UN peacekeeping mission MONUSCO [UN Stabilization Mission in the DR Congo] was among the latest victims of the virus, the UN and DRC health ministry said.

[Although the Ebola outbreak has not spread beyond the borders of the DRC, it seems like a wise proactive step to declare a PHEIC (Public Health Emergency of International Concern). The situation is threatening neighboring countries and it is not clear what is the value of waiting for spread to occur. Although the global risk may be low, the regional risk is very high. - Mod.LK]
