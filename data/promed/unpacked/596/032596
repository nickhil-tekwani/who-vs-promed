Case of CCHF in a Dagestan woman confirmed
------------------------------------------
A Dagestan woman has been registered as a case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic
fever (CCHF). According to the head of the local health authority, Zoya
Magometowa, the woman was bitten by a tick in her abdominal region while
milking a cow on 16 Apr 2008. After the bite she developed a fever but did
not seek medical help immediately.

Then, 2 days later when her condition deteriorated, she sought medical
help. According to Magometowa, the initial tests for CCHF were negative and
the diagnosis was only confirmed by a 2nd test. She added that the course
of the patient's disease had been mild and the woman has now been
discharged from hospital.

[The number of regions (of Russia) that had cases of CCHF this year, 2008,
increases. The leaders in numbers are Stavrapol krai with more than 30
cases, Rostov oblast with more than 10 cases and Kalmikia, Ingushetia with
few cases (unfortunately the exact numbers are not known to us). Now
Dagestan adds to these unfavorable statistics. Warm weather and rains
create comfortable environment for ticks -- the transmitters of CCHF. There
are cases of CCHF in south Kazakhstan regions as well, particularly in
Kizilordinskaya oblast, where this infection is registered every year. - Mod.NP
