Thousands of turkeys are being treated for the symptoms of bird flu at a factory farm operated by the Bernard Matthews group.

Tests are being carried out after signs of the disease were spotted at the farm in Suffolk, which is where the food giant is based.

The Government's food and farming department Defra yesterday confirmed that its experts have detected a strain of the virus at the farm.

Any evidence of bird flu is taken extremely seriously and historically has led to major culls in order to prevent any spread of the virus. On this occasion the company claims that the 5000 turkeys involved, which are used as breeding stock, can be successfully treated with antibiotics, rather than being destroyed.

A Defra spokesman said: "We are awaiting further laboratory test results from an on-going investigation into suspect avian disease at a premises in the South East.
"The premises remains under restriction pending further results.
"Public Health England are aware and are ready to take the necessary action pending further test results.'

Bernard Matthews died in November 2010 but his company still runs 56 farms across Norfolk, Suffolk and Lincolnshire.
A company spokesman said: "On Sunday the birds were displaying symptoms of ill health, which Bernard Matthews recognised as bird flu because of previous outbreaks.
"We notified Defra, which agreed and has since ruled out the illness as being the H5 and H7 forms of the virus -- the notifiable strains which can be transferred from birds to humans.
"Prior to Defra's arrival we treated the birds with antibiotics and the birds have been getting better since."

He added: "I would like to stress -- there is no risk whatsoever to humans from this outbreak."

The Bernard Matthews company was heavily criticised in 2007 following the discovery of a strain of the H5N1 type of bird flu on a major farm and processing centre in Holton, Suffolk. An official inquiry found that the firm had failed to put right a series of health and hygiene failures that allowed the virus to spread. Squalid conditions at the farm and processing factory in Suffolk were implicated in triggering the outbreak of the virus which led to the slaughter of 159 000 young turkeys. Subsequently, hundreds of farms in East Anglia were effectively placed into quarantine and banned from moving their poultry.

[Avian influenza] has been discovered at a poultry farm in Suffolk, according to environment agency Defra [UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs].

The outbreak was confirmed at the Bernard Matthews farm after signs of the disease were spotted over the weekend [13-14 Apr 2013].

Environment agency Defra confirmed the outbreak but said initial tests were negative for the H5 and H7 strains, which are potentially lethal for humans.

However, movement restrictions are in place at the farm and further tests are due to be carried out.

A company spokesman said: "Bernard Matthews can confirm that Defra have undertaken tests for avian influenza on one of its farms following notification by the company after some birds showed signs of ill health over the weekend.

"The tests have detected the presence of an avian influenza virus, but Defra have confirmed it is not the highly pathogenic types H5 or H7.

"As a precaution, the farm remains currently under movement restrictions but these are expected to be lifted in the next few days. Bernard Matthews' other operations continue to run as normal."

The scare comes after an outbreak of the deadly H7N9 virus in China, where 16 [17] people have now died.

Some 77 [83] cases have been reported in total although no human-to-human spread of the virus has been confirmed.

A Defra spokesman said: "We are awaiting further laboratory test results from an on-going investigation into suspect avian disease at a premises in the South East. The premises remains under restriction pending further results. Public Health England are aware and are ready to take the necessary action pending further test results."

[The source of infection in the described turkeys is, most probably, wild birds. In 2007, a free-range turkey flock belonging to the same firm was found infected by HPAI H5N1, followed by eradication of the outbreak (see ProMED-mail posting 20071114.3693). In 2009, LPAI H6N1 was reported (see ProMED-mail posting 20090301.0852).

Avian influenza (AI) is caused by specified viruses that are members of the family _Orthomyxoviridae_ and placed in the genus _Influenzavirus A_. There are 3 influenza genera -- A, B, and C; only influenza A viruses are known to infect birds.

There are 16 haemagglutinin (H1-16) and 9 neuraminidase (N1-9) subtypes of influenza A virus. Any highly pathogenic avian influenza isolate (HPAI) is classified as notifiable avian influenza (NAI) virus. Although all naturally occurring virulent strains isolated to date have been either of the H5 or H7 subtype, most H5 or H7 isolates have been of low pathogenicity (LPAI). Due to the risk of a LPAI H5 or H7 subtype becoming virulent by mutation in poultry hosts, all H5 and H7 viruses -- including low-pathogenic ones -- have also been classified as NAI viruses.

According to Defra, initial tests have ruled out the H5 or H7 strains of the disease (https://www.gov.uk/government/news/avian-influenza-testing). Results of the tests to define the subtype and the pathogenicity are expected. The prescribed laboratory methods for the identification of the virus and for the determination of its pathogenicity rate are described in OIE's terrestrial manual; see at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.04_AI.pdf.

If the causative agent is found to be of low pathogenicity, the event is not regarded as notifiable. - Mod.AS
