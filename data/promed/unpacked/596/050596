Update on mumps outbreak in the Maritimes: national summary, 4 May 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Mumps cases are currently being reported in 4 Canadian provinces (Nova
Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Ontario). Mumps is an
acute viral infection of the salivary glands. Symptoms include fever,
headache, muscle ache, and swelling and tenderness of the salivary glands
at the angle of the jaw (parotid glands). Infection occurs through direct
contact with respiratory droplets from the nose or throat, through saliva,
coughing, sneezing, sharing drinks, kissing, or from contact with any
surface that has been contaminated with the mumps virus. Rarely, mumps
infection can lead to meningitis, inflammation of the testicles or ovaries,
inflammation of the pancreas, and transient or permanent hearing loss.
As of 4 May 2007, 241 confirmed cases of mumps had been reported from the 4
affected provinces.
Table: Age and sex distribution of confirmed* mumps cases reported in 4
Canadian provinces, 4 May 2007 (N=241):
Province / number / median age / percentage males
Nova Scotia / 203 / 22 / 45
New Brunswick / 34 / 21 / 44
Prince Edward Island / 1 / 18 / 100
Ontario / 3 / 29 / 100
* Confirmed cases include both laboratory-confirmed and clinical cases
(latter are epi-linked to laboratory-confirmed cases).
In Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, the majority of cases were reported from
only one or 2 public health authorities with limited activity seen
elsewhere in these provinces. About 90 per cent and 25 per cent of the
cases in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick respectively, are associated with
university settings. The viral strain in these outbreaks is identical to
the strain (genotype G) detected from the 2005-06 Nova Scotia outbreaks,
the United States' multistate outbreak in 2006, and the United Kingdom
epidemic between 2004 and 2006. The Ontario cases are all linked to cases
in the Maritimes.
Information on date of onset is known for 217 of the 241 confirmed mumps
cases reported, and is displayed as a histogram in the original text. The
remaining 24 cases are pending or missing dates of onset.
The majority of cases are occurring among university-aged individuals. The
reason for the particular susceptibility among this cohort is
multifactorial. The very social and mobile lifestyle of this age group
appears to be facilitating disease transmission and is posing barriers to
the adherence of isolation requests. Communication efforts are increasing
as the post-secondary academic year [ends] and students disperse.
Additional cases in this demographic group and possibly other jurisdictions
would not be unexpected. However, during previous outbreaks in Canada, this
has not resulted in sustained transmission or large outbreaks.
It is assumed that most people over the age of about 40 years have natural
immunity to mumps. Most people between the ages of 12 and 17 years
(depending on the province of residence) have had 2 doses of mumps vaccine
due to the introduction of a second dose of measles, mumps and rubella
(MMR) vaccine for measles control in 1996-97. This has left a susceptible
cohort of people between the approximate ages of 12 or 17 (depending on the
province or territory) and 40 years who were only eligible for one dose of
MMR vaccine and who are not assumed to have natural immunity. It is
important to note, that the age at which natural immunity to mumps can be
assumed is not known with certainty and that some individuals born prior to
1970 may still be susceptible to mumps.
The 2004 national immunization coverage survey (NICS) found that 94 per
cent of Canadian children had received single dose of the MMR vaccine by
their 2nd birthday. Coverage estimates for the 2nd dose of MMR by 7 years
of age was 79 per cent. Finally, 93 per cent of Canadians had received one
or more doses of mumps vaccine by their 17th birthday.
Public health actions
---------------------
[See Mumps, Canada (multi-province) 20070505.1459]
Due to a risk of exposure to measles, NACI currently recommends a 2nd dose
of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) for certain adults born
after 1970. This includes students at post secondary institutions and
health care workers.
