Mumps Make Comeback in Southern Nevada
--------------------------------------
There have been 6 cases of mumps reported in Clark County over the
past several weeks. This is drawing a concern from the Southern
Nevada Health District. The health department says these recent cases
prove the virus is in circulation locally.

The health district says in terms of mumps, 6 cases are more than
they would want to see in the county. Now the department is asking
people to get vaccinated if they haven't yet. And even if you have
been vaccinated, there is still a small chance you might get the virus.

"It's possible any person at any age can come down with mumps even if
you have been vaccinated," said Southern Nevada Health District
epidemiologist, Brian Labus. It's a virus that can spread fast. Labus
says his office has not seen a trend in mumps cases like this in a
while. "This is out of the ordinary, that's why were interested and
that's why we're letting the community know what's going on. This is
more than we would expect to see," said Labus.

The more visual symptom of the disease are swollen glands near the
neck. The greatest mumps epidemic was in in 1941, when children were
more prone to it. Labus says the 6 people who have come down with the
mumps vary in age and it is possible for any person at any age to
come down with the mumps.

"You really see this disease against all ages. You used to expect to
see it as a childhood disease, but it really affects age ranges from
the young to the old -- anybody can be at risk for getting the
disease," said Labus.

The disease is contagious and usually spread by breathing in the
virus after an infected person coughs or sneezes near you or by
coming in direct contact with the saliva of an infected person.

Mumps symptoms:
-- Fever of 101 F to 104 F.
-- Headache, earache, sore throat
-- Pain when swallowing
-- Tiredness
-- Muscle and joint aches
-- Poor appetite and vomiting.

If you have had mumps in the past, you are pretty much immune from
getting it again. Even if you have been vaccinated in the past, there
is still about a 5 percent chance the vaccine may not work.

Clark County is located in the southern tip of the state; see map at

Las Vegas is the principal city.


There has been a massive resurgence of mumps virus infection in
Canada in recent months, affecting principally young adults who had
not been vaccinated or had received only a single dose of mumps
vaccine as children. The victims were predominantly university and
college students and the outbreak spread across Canada from New
Brunswick the site of the 1st cases mainly through university
campuses. The outbreak is being contained by a comprehensive
revaccination campaign.

The Nevada report contains no information about the ages or
vaccination status of the 6 cases in Clark county. It would be
interesting to know if there is any link with the Canadian outbreak
through the movement of students or young adults. Further information
would be appreciated. - Mod.CP]
