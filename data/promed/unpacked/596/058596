Quebec City's large Legionnaires' disease outbreak appears to be under control, the city's public health director said Friday [7 Sep 2012]. Dr. Francois Desbiens said measures the city's public health department has taken to ensure cooling towers in the outbreak zone have been cleaned and disinfected appear to be bearing fruit.
But it is too soon to say the outbreak is over, he insisted in an interview with The Canadian Press. "At this time what we say is the outbreak is under control, because we don't have new cases with the [onset of their disease symptoms] after [29 Aug 2012]," Desbiens said. "But as there is an incubation period from 2 to 10 days and some people could have their disease (set in) 14 days or 20 days later - but this is rare -- we prefer to wait ... till we're there to be sure scientifically that the outbreak is completely terminated."

His office reported one additional case on Friday [7 Sep 2012], bringing the total to date to 176 cases. Since the outbreak began in July [2012], 11 people have died from the disease. There have only been 3 cases this [past] week, a significant slowing of the case count from earlier in the outbreak. And none of the people who have become ill started to show symptoms after [29 Aug 2012], which is why Desbiens hopes the outbreak is on the wane.

His office is also making some progress in their efforts to find the source of contagion, though that work is painfully slow. For that they can blame the bug, which grows poorly and slowly in a laboratory setting. Legionnaires' disease is caused by _Legionella_ bacteria. There are 40 species of _Legionella_ but a subtype called _Legionella pneumophila_ is generally responsible for Legionnaires' infections. Specifically, _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 is the most common cause of the disease.

And it appears to be the cause of the Quebec City outbreak as well. Samples from 9 patients show the exact same bacteria -- _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1, pulsovar A, Desbiens said. "We have 9 of the same pulsovars, so maybe we'll able to find the same pulsovar in one of our cooling towers," he said. "We're still waiting for the results to come to us from the lab." (A sample from a 10th patient revealed a different version of the bacteria, but Desbiens said that can happen. "We can have an isolated case of _Legionella_ infection [due to a different strain] inside a major outbreak.")

Desbiens said water samples were taken from all of the 129 cooling towers in the outbreak zone; some have grown _Legionella_ bacteria that can be compared against the human samples. Quebec's provincial microbiology lab in Montreal is currently working to type those environmental samples.

There remains, however, a possibility that the investigators won't be able to match the bacteria from patients to bacteria from a cooling tower. Many of the samples taken from towers have not produced bacteria. That could mean some weren't contaminated in the 1st place. But in some cases, it might be because the lab couldn't coax the bacteria to grow.

Desbiens said while he hopes his team will be able to solve the mystery, the most important thing is to stop the spread of the disease. "I'm happy to say that the outbreak is under control," he said. "I hope we'll be able to find the place [source], to explain the situation. But what is most important for me, it's that the outbreak ceases. I have to protect the health of the people from an infectious disease and it has worked. Now let's see if the lab will be able to show me where it was. It would be good to know it. But it's not essential to have it to (bring) the outbreak under control."

[For a discussion of Legionnaires' disease, see ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - UK (02): (Scotland) 20120605.1156972.

In the previous ProMED-mail post of this outbreak in Quebec City (Legionellosis - Canada (05): (QC) fatal, more cases, RFI 20120830.1273257), there were a total of 141 cases of Legionnaires' disease, including 9 fatalities. Now, there are a total of 176 cases, including 11 fatalities. No new cases have had the onset of symptoms after 29 Aug 2012, which suggested to the Quebec authorities that the outbreak may be over, because the incubation period of Legionnaires' disease (the time from exposure to the onset of symptoms) of 2 to 10 days.

We are told that specimens from 9 patients have grown _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1; all 9 organisms have the same genotype, which suggests there is a common source for at least these 9 patients.

We are awaiting the results of cultures and genotyping of isolates from perhaps additional patients and cooling towers of air-conditioning systems in large buildings in the downtown area of Quebec City that are suspected to be the source of the outbreak. 129 cooling towers in the "outbreak zone" have been cleaned, in expanding circles, since the 1st report in ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - Canada: (Quebec) fatal, cooling tower susp. 20120805.1228680. A common source can be identified if the genotype of clinical and environmental isolates match.
