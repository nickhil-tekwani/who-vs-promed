Botulism suspected in Michigan bird deaths
------------------------------------------
Dead birds are washing ashore in Antrim County, and environmental
scientists suspect botulism associated with invasive mussels is to blame.
Beachgoers recently have spotted dozens of loon and grebe carcasses
littering beaches along the eastern shore of Grand Traverse Bay. The
disease has killed thousands of birds in the Great Lakes region in recent
years.

"I walk on the beach every day, and I've seen some dead birds," Sherri
DeCamp, who lives on the bay north of Elk Rapids, told the Traverse City
Record-Eagle for a story Friday [2 Nov 2007]. "I would guess we see 4 or 5
each day, new ones."

Nearly 3000 gulls, grebes, and red-breasted mergansers turned up on beaches
along a 12 mile stretch of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore in
November 2006. They died from type E botulism, a neuromuscular disease
caused by bacteria. The birds had eaten fish that carried the toxin,
biologists said.

More than 52 000 bird deaths around the Great Lakes have been attributed to
the same botulism strain since 2002 in addition to the Sleeping Bear Dunes
birds, the US Environmental Protection Agency says.

The Michigan Department of Natural Resources collected 20 bird carcasses
this week [29 Oct - 2 Nov 2007] from the beach a couple of miles north of
Elk Rapids. They will be tested for botulism, said Tom Cooley, a biologist
with the DNR's wildlife disease laboratory.

Scientists believe zebra and quagga mussels, which invaded the Great Lakes
in the 1980s, may filter the bacteria and pass it up the food chain to fish
such as the round goby, which in turn are prey for aquatic birds. "It's an
easy way for the birds to be exposed to the bacteria," Cooley said.

[The sporulating anaerobic Gram positive bacillus _Clostridium botulinum_
elaborates 7 types of antigenically distinct neurotoxins, 4 of which affect
humans: type A, B, E, or rarely type F. Toxins types A and B are highly
poisonous proteins resistant to digestion by gastrointestinal (GI) enzymes.
About 50 per cent of foodborne [botulism] outbreaks in the USA are caused
by type A toxin, followed by types B and E.

Type C botulism occurs principally in waterfowl and other birds living in
an aquatic environment and causes tremendous losses, most notably in
waterfowl in the western US. In addition to North America, it has been
reported in birds in Europe, South Africa, Uruguay, and Australia. In the
Great Lakes region, it was first identified in 1936 in ducks on Green Bay
of Lake Michigan and in 1941 in Monroe County marshes along Lake Erie. Type
C is most often associated with limberneck paralysis in birds.

_C. botulinum_ spores are relatively heat-resistant, though high
temperatures and/or exposure to moist heat will kill the spores.

Although botulism can be difficult to manage in a scenario such as this, it
is still important to pick up the dead birds. Maggots that grow in the
carcass with harbor the botulinum toxin and when other birds consume the
maggots, a new toxicity results. So picking up the dead birds can help
control the outbreak. It will be interesting to see type of botulism the
birds have. We hope for a definitive report.
