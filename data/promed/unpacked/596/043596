Yellow fever in the Republic of the Congo
-----------------------------------------
As of 1 Apr 2009 the Ministry of Health of the Republic of the Congo
reported one case of yellow fever detected on 28 Jan 2009 by the
epidemiological surveillance system for yellow fever. The case was
initially laboratory tested at the Institut National de Recherche
Biomedical (INRB) in the Democratic Republic of Congo and
subsequently laboratory-confirmed at the Institut Pasteur of Dakar
[Senegal], the regional WHO collaborating centre for yellow fever.

The index case was a 55-year-old male farmer living in Mbama
district, Cuvette West Department. He initially presented with acute
abdominal pain and subsequently developed fever and jaundice. He was
first evaluated in health facilities in Mbama district and was then
referred to the district hospital in Ewo district.

From 23-25 Mar 2009, a yellow fever outbreak investigation team
composed of specialists from the MoH and WHO visited Mbama district.
No further cases were detected. The samples were sent for laboratory
analysis at the Institut Pasteur, Dakar and confirmed by YF
seroneutralization, a highly specific test for yellow fever.

The Republic of the Congo had previously benefited from mass
vaccination during the years 1930 to 1960. The last outbreak reported
was in 1981, and no cases have been confirmed since. The outbreak
response vaccination campaign will cover a target population of 73
011 people and has been planned for 6 May 2009.

This is the 1st ProMED-mail report of yellow fever in the Republic of
the Congo)

There is some uncertainty concerning the location of this case. The
Mbama district (cited above) is in the Pool region, and the Mbomo
district is in the Cuvette-Ouest (West) region (also stated above).
