SALT LAKE CITY -- Five more wild horses have tested positive for a deadly
virus and land managers are resigned to the likelihood they may end up
killing as many as half of the animals in one large herd to stop the virus
from spreading. The rate of infection for animals with Equine Infectious
Anemia in a herd of more than 150 horses continues at nearly 50 percent and
officials no longer expect it to get much better. The normal rate of
infection is well below 1 percent.
The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Humane Society of America are
negotiating to try to spare a number of foals that tested positive but
might not really be sick. So far, eight young horses are scheduled to be
euthanized.
Tests on nine horses gathered Tuesday showed five were infected, including
one foal. That's in keeping with the rate of infection found in 53 horses
from the same herd gathered earlier. Of those, 27 -- including seven foals
-- tested positive.
State veterinarian Mike Marshall has ordered the BLM to destroy all
infected animals by Monday at 5 p.m. That order has sparked outrage from
the Humane Society of America, which is concerned that some of the foals
may be carrying [maternal antibodies passed on by their mothers [to the
foals in the maternal colostrum ... MHJ and might not actually be sick.
Marshall acknowledged that a few of the foals may have "passive antibodies"
to the disease. "My job is to prevent disease in healthy horses," said
Marshall. "I have to ask if those one or two foals is worth the risk to all
of the healthy population."
It is expected that the roundup in the 142,000-acre Bonanza herd management
area -- where all of the sick animals have been found -- should be
completed by [next Tuesday. The area is about 140 miles southeast of Salt
Lake.

Is there any support for NOT euthanizing the infected horses and letting
natural selection build up a population of naturally immune (or at least
surviving) individuals? If the population of horses was allowed to live
and die, then would not a genetically "strong" herd be developed? In the
long run, this would take care of the problem of transmission to domestic
horses because the disease would either be absent or present at only a low
level in the wild horse population.
Isn't human intervention here circumventing the process of natural selection?

[The problem with EIA is that infected animals have a chronic viraemia and
the virus demonstrates an active mutability. My colleague Chuck Issel was
well funded because EIV was once considered an animal virus model for HIV.
The horse industry in this country is too valuable to put it at risk from
EIA. - Mod.MHJ
