With summer [2012] just around the corner, 15 people have already been detected with _Plasmodium falciparum_ and _Plasmodium vivax_, the deadliest form of malaria in Banke district.

As a result, health authorities are on high alert, with the disease likely to rise with the onset of the monsoon. People suffering from _P. falciparum_ and _P. vivax_ show symptoms of sudden fever, shivering and vomiting.

A similar rise in malaria in 2006 cost the lives of 33 people in Fattehpur, Gangapur, and Holia VDCs of the district. Health authorities in the district are planning to speed up free distribution of mosquito nets this year [2012], with the cooperation of various organisations, according to District Public Health Office Chief, Jeevan Malla. The number of malaria patients had increased last year [2011], when mosquito net distribution was not continued, he said.

Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by eukaryotic protozoans of the genus _Plasmodium_. The disease results from the multiplication of _Plasmodium_ parasites within red blood cells, causing symptoms that typically include fever and headache and, in severe cases, progressing to coma or death.
