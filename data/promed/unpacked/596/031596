Abstract
-------
Expansion of quinolone-resistant _Neisseria meningitidis_ clone ChinaCC4821-R1-C/B from sequence type (ST) 4821 clonal complex (CC4821) caused a serogroup shift from serogroup A to serogroup C invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) in China. To determine the relationship among globally distributed CC4821 meningococci, we analyzed whole-genome sequence data from 173 CC4821 meningococci isolated from 4 continents during 1972-2019. These meningococci clustered into 4 sublineages (1-4); sublineage 1 primarily comprised of IMD isolates (41/50, 82%). Most isolates from outside China (40/49, 81.6%) formed a distinct sublineage, the Europe-USA cluster, with the typical strain designation B:P1.17-6,23:F3-36:ST-3200(CC4821), harboring mutations in penicillin-binding protein 2. These data show that the quinolone-resistant clone ChinaCC4821-R1-C/B has expanded to other countries. The increasing distribution worldwide of serogroup B CC4821 raises the concern that CC4821 has the potential to cause a pandemic that would be challenging to control, despite indirect evidence that the Trumenba vaccine might afford some protection.

_Neisseria meningitidis_, a leading cause of bacterial meningitis and septicemia globally, causes approx. 1.2 million invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) cases annually and a case fatality rate of 11% (1). Meningococci are classified into 12 serogroups based on capsular polysaccharides (1); genetic relationships among isolates are defined by clonal complexes (CCs) identified by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), which are surrogates for lineages (2). The relationship among serogroups, CCs (lineages), and IMD fluctuates over time and by location, but IMD isolates are dominated by CCs known as hyperinvasive lineages, usually associated with one of the 6 disease-causing serogroups (MenA, MenB, MenC, MenW, MenX, and MenY).

In China, the national dissemination of hyperinvasive sequence type (ST) 4821 clonal complex (CC4821) meningococci led to a shift in IMD epidemiology from mostly MenA to predominantly MenC (3,4). Although no quinolone resistance was identified in CC4821 in China during 1965-1985, high-frequency resistance (79%) occurred from 2005 onward due to expansion of the quinolone-resistant clone ChinaCC4821-R1-C/B (5). Previous studies discovered that CC4821 can be divided into 2 groups, with group 1 associated with IMD (6,7). Peng et al. identified 6 strain-specific genome regions resulting from horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in isolate 053442 (8); this finding was consistent with the emergence of the ChinaCC4821-R1-C/B clone associated with multiple HGT events within genes encoding surface antigens (6), although the donors of these events were not identified.

Globally, the number of CC4821 IMD isolates has increased. At the time CC4821 was identified, isolates were confined to China (4,9); however, by June 2020, a total of 59 CC4821 isolates had been identified in 19 counties worldwide (Figure 1). Moreover, 3 IMD cases caused by quinolone-resistant CC4821 isolates were reported in Canada (n = 2) and Japan (n = 1) after 2013 (10,11); 3 other CC4821 isolates were found to colonize the anorectal tract of men who have sex with men (MSM) (12). We investigated the genomic events leading to the emergence and expansion of hyperinvasive CC4821 meningococci by describing the phylogenetic relationships among meningococci with different serogroups (MenC, MenB, MenW, and nongroupable), sources (IMD, carriage, and MSM), locations (China or other countries), and dates of isolation (1972-1978 vs. 2005-2019). We assessed genes encoding key antigens and antimicrobial resistance phenotypes, identified putative donors of HGT events unique to the epidemic and quinolone-resistant clone ChinaCC4821-R1-C/B, and characterized isolates outside of China.

Discussion
----------
The meningococci can cause IMD, leading to endemic disease in most if not all human populations. Several genotypes belonging to hyperinvasive lineages, in combination with the disease-associated capsular serogroups, can cause elevated levels of disease; some of which also possess epidemic and pandemic potential. In the past 100 years, notable epidemics and pandemics have included meningococci such as A:CC1, A:CC5, B:CC41/44, C:CC11, and W:CC11 (35). Here, we employed a genomic analysis of MenB, MenC, and MenW CC4821 isolates dating from 1972-2019 to assess their epidemic and pandemic potential. Of special concern are the expansion of the quinolone-resistant clone ChinaCC4821-R1-C/B from China to other countries; the potential possession of universal resistance to penicillin in Europe-USA cluster isolates; and the uncertainty over the potential efficacy of existing vaccines to prevent B:CC4821 diseases.

CC4821, which corresponds to lineage 44, shares several properties in common with the hyperinvasive CC11 meningococci (L11): its ability to express several serogroups, global distribution, colonization of urogenital and anorectal tracts, and separation into distinct sublineages. CC11 has caused well-documented epidemics and pandemics on several occasions, including US military outbreaks in the 1960s; Hajj-associated outbreaks in 2000s; and the global epidemics from 2010, especially outbreaks among MSM (34-38). These similar characteristics raise the concern that the CC4821 may have the potential to cause similar global pandemics.

Consistent with the presence of the epidemic CC4821 clone in countries outside of China, 6 CC4821 IMD meningococci from India, Japan, and New Zealand, isolated during 2014-2018, clustered with ChinaCC4821-R1-C/B meningococci in L44.1 (Figure 3). IMD cases caused by these 6 isolates were all found in native inhabitants (10,15,39); all 6 isolates shared similar serogroup, antibiotic, and antigen (except porA and fHbp) gene characteristics with isolates from China in this sublineage. In particular, all 6 isolates harbored the T91I mutation in GyrA, the molecular marker of quinolone resistance, compatible with their quinolone-resistant phenotype (10,15,39). These isolates also had strain-specific features, which suggested that they resulted from transmission from the ChinaCC4821-R1-C/B clone. The isolate from Japan, which had the typical molecular features of the Anhui outbreak strain (C:P1.7-2,14:F3-3:ST-4821[CC4821]) (4), became the earliest-reported quinolone-resistant meningococcus harboring ParC mutation (S87I, allele 1538) to cause IMD worldwide (10). In contrast, none of the ChinaCC4821-R1-C/B clone isolates from China had ParC mutations conferring antimicrobial resistance. The isolate from Japan was more closely related to the reference strain 053442 than were the 4 India and 1 New Zealand isolates, which had different STs, porA, fHbp, and tbpA alleles (Figure 4).

Although we did not identify a putative ancestor of the quinolone-resistant clone ChinaCC4821-R1-C/B in this study, we found 299 loci with alleles unique to this sublineage. Approximately half of these loci were associated with metabolic pathways, suggesting that divergence in metabolic genes may play a role in the emergence of epidemic meningococci. Several studies have indicated that metabolic genes can influence the pathogenesis and virulence of the meningococcus, for example by allowing alternative host resources to be exploited in invasive disseminated infections (40). Changes in the hyperinvasive A:CC5 meningococci circulating in Africa have been associated with HGT of core genes involved in metabolic processes (41). The putative donors of these unique alleles included lineages from different serogroups and dates of isolation, such as C:ST-9514 cluster, 1960s-1970s; A:CC5 and A:CC1, 1960s-1980s; B:CC32, 1960s; B:CC41/44, 1970s; and E:CC178, 1980s (Table 4). The C:ST-9514 cluster, STs that do not presently form part of a clonal complex documented in PubMLST, has ST9514 as the central ST and was predominant in MenC carriage isolates during 1965-1980 in Shanghai, China (42). Therefore, the emergence of ChinaCC4821-R1-C/B clone was perhaps associated with accumulation of these unique alleles, which accounted for the separation from other sublineages in the allele-based phylogeny (Figure 2).

In the PubMLST database, over 60% of the CC4821 isolates from outside China were MenB. Of these, 49 genomes were available in this study, including isolates from IMD (n = 15) and urogenital and rectal tracts (n = 6). Most of these genomes clustered in sublineage L44.3 and constituted a distinct cluster, the Europe-USA cluster, showing the typical strain designation: B:P1.17-6,23-x:F3-36:ST-3200(CC4821), wherein 23-x refers to 23, 23-2, and 23-6. The PorA and FetA types P1.17-6,23-x and F3-36 were only found in this cluster. The _Neisseria_ PubMLST database had no genome data for 24 CC4821 isolates from other countries (United States, Brazil, France, Czech Republic, Spain, Italy, Australia, and Viet Nam), but included PorA or FetA variants for the 24 isolates (Appendix 1 Table 5). Of these, 19 (79.2%) exhibited P1.17-6,23-x or F3-36, suggesting they might belong to the Europe-USA cluster. This cluster was distinct from the epidemic clone ChinaCC4821-R1-C/B. For example, the antigen profile characteristic of the Europe-USA cluster was P1.17-6,23-x, F3-36, PorB-3-229, fHbp-16, nhba-553, opcA-100, nspA-26, and tbpA-1333, compared with P1.7-2,14, F3-3, PorB-3-48, fHbp-498, 22 and 489, nhba-124, opcA-4, nspA-4, and tbpA-7 in the ChinaCC4821-R1-C/B clone. In addition, all the ChinaCC4821-R1-C/B isolates harbored the mutation T91I in GyrA, whereas almost all of the Europe-USA cluster isolates possessed mutations in PBP2 (F504L, A510V, I515V, H541N, and I566V). This may reflect different antibiotic selective pressures experienced by the Europe-USA and the ChinaCC4821-R1-C/B meningococci. Penicillins were the most-used antimicrobial drugs in outpatients in Europe, whereas China has the 2nd largest global increases of fluoroquinolone consumption (43,44). A high frequency (over 70%) of quinolone resistance has been reported in China since 2005 (5), whereas 65% of meningococci in Europe showed reduced susceptibility to penicillin G during 1945-2006 (45). In the 2 oldest isolates of the sublineage L44.3, Nm282 (B:P1.20,23:F3-36:ST-3200[CC4812]) was much closer to the Europe-USA cluster isolates than Nm323 (B:P1.20,23:F3-36:ST-5798[CC4821]) (Figure 5), and it seemed more likely to be the ancestor of the Europe-USA cluster isolates.

Urogenital and rectal meningococci have raised increasing public health concerns (34). In 2017, CC4821 anorectal isolates were identified in the United Kingdom (12). In this study, we identified CC4821 isolates from urethral and rectal tracts that clustered with isolates from IMD specimens and oropharyngeal carriage (Figure 5). With the exception of L44.1 isolates, most of the CC4821 isolates contained a putatively functional nitrite reductase (AniA), required for growth in anaerobic environments. The CC4821 isolates acquired quinolone resistance alleles from _N. lactamica_ and _N. subflava_ (46); the ability to grow in anaerobic environments will facilitate acquisition of gonococcal alleles, including antimicrobial resistance alleles. Such events seem to have already occurred in a sublineage of CC11, which was responsible for several IMD outbreaks and urethritis among MSM (34). They shared the same penA allele (penA327/penAXXXIV) with gonococcal bacteria and showed decreased susceptibility to 3rd-generation cephalosporins (47). Although PubMLST is the largest global repository of meningococcal genomes (over 22 000), a paucity of genomic data were available from isolates originating from the genitourinary or respiratory tract, suggesting an underestimation of the global dissemination of CC4821. Therefore, we recommend WGS for urogenital-, rectal-, and respiratory-derived meningococci if patients are exhibiting antimicrobial resistance.

CC4821 lineage 44 includes isolates from different serogroups, including MenB, MenC, and MenW. In China, MenC and MenW isolates can be prevented by vaccines, such as group A and C meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPV-AC) and MPV-ACYW, but no routinely administered vaccine is available to prevent MenB IMD (48). Two protein-based MenB vaccines, 4CMenB (Bexsero) and rLP2086 (Trumenba), have been licensed in several countries (49-50; Appendix 2 reference 51), but limited data are available on the bacterial coverage of these vaccines to CC4821 isolates directly from serum bactericidal activity assays, the Meningococcal Antigen Typing System (MATS) for Bexsero, or meningococcal antigen surface expression for Trumenba. One B:CC4821 isolate (M14-240580, UK) was reported to be tested using the MATS assay and showed no potential protection (Appendix 2 reference 52). Using systems to index complex genotypic and phenotypic data, such as the MenDeVAR Index, we predicted that approx. 60% of B:CC4821 disease-causing isolates might be prevented through vaccination with Trumenba; data are insufficient to infer Bexsero reactivity. Further testing of globally diverse meningococci is needed with these experimental assays to analyze potential vaccine impact in settings outside Europe.

In summary, we have undertaken a comprehensive genomic analysis of a hyperinvasive meningococcal CC4821 expressing MenB, MenC, and MenW with expansion from China to other global geographic locations with currently available genomic data. We identified key genomic factors and putative evolutionary changes that might have led to the emergence and persistence of the epidemic quinolone-resistant clone in China. Vaccine coverage for MenB CC4821 isolates needs further evaluation. Enhanced laboratory surveillance for CC4821 isolates from IMD cases and from oropharyngeal, urethral, and rectal carriage is needed to monitor global trends of expansion, which will be essential for local immunization policies.

[This is an important paper on the expansion of the fluoroquinolone-resistant clone ChinaCC4821-R1-C/B from China to other countries, complicated further by the clone's potential possession of resistance to penicillin in the Europe-USA cluster isolates and the uncertainty over the potential efficacy of existing vaccines to prevent serogroup B:CC4821 disease.

_Neisseria meningitidis_ show considerable genetic diversity, owing to the ability of meningococci for transformation and horizontal gene exchange, presumably with co-colonizing strains in the human nasopharynx. Gene exchange can lead to constant diversification of meningococcal populations during clonal spread. For example, invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) (meningitis and sepsis) is usually due to one of 6 (A, B, C, W, X, and Y) of the 12 meningococcal serogroups, based on the composition of their polysaccharide capsule; however, capsular switching can occur leading a clone to change from one capsular polysaccharide serogroup to another. Capsular switching enables meningococci to escape from the host's immune defenses against the original serogroup.

Molecular epidemiology has revealed that most cases of IMD are caused by only a few hypervirulent clonal complexes (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC179822/). Clonal complexes (CCs) are identified by multilocus sequence typing (MLST), which are surrogates for lineages. MLST examines DNA sequences of portions of 7 housekeeping genes, which define the sequence type (ST). ST11 (that is, CC11) has caused well-documented epidemics and pandemics, for example, the Hajj-associated outbreaks in the 2000s and outbreaks among men who have sex with men (MSM).

Sequencing genes that encode outer member proteins (for example, porins PorA and PorB and FetA, an iron-regulated outer membrane protein) are used to further characterize strains (called fine typing) to monitor epidemiological changes over time and from one geographic region to another.

Meningococci usually colonize the nasopharynx, in which case the organism is transmitted from person-to-person via droplets of respiratory secretions. However, data suggest that gene exchange allow meningococci to adapt to a urethral or rectal location (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28373547) and then be transmitted by sexual activity. Meningococci with identical genotype have been isolated from cases with urethritis/proctitis and MSM with IMD in Germany and France. However, strains that were isolated from MSM with IMD were found to have genes that facilitated survival in the blood, unlike strains that remained in the urethra or rectum. The meningococcal isolates from both MSM with IMD and urethritis were able to grow anaerobically in the presence of nitrite, as do gonococci, unlike non-MSM/urethritis meningococcal isolates. Anaerobic growth is thought to allow meningococci to survive under anaerobic and acidic pH in the urethra or rectum, leading to the clinical manifestation of urethritis/proctitis, as well as the capacity for direct sexual transmission.
