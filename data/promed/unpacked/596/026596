The number of people who have died in a cholera epidemic affecting Yemen has risen to at least 471, according to World Health Organization (WHO) figures released on [Mon 29 May 2017]. But the latest WHO bulletin covering the period from [Thu 27 April 2017], said that there was a "significant decrease" in the daily average number of cases recorded in the week up to [Sat 27 May 2017] compared to the previous 7-day period.

The epidemic began in October 2016 and grew until December 2016. It then dwindled but was never brought fully under control, and a new surge in cases began in April 2017. Yemen has been hit hard by civil war, with 19 million of its 28 million people needing humanitarian aid and many of them on the brink of famine. Fewer than half of the country's health facilities are fully functional.

WHO said on [Mon 29 May 2017] that the average daily number of cases recorded between 21 and 27 May was 2529 -- down from 3025 in the previous 7 days. The bulletin said that the total number of suspected cases stood at 51 832.

Caused by ingesting bacteria from water or food contaminated with feces, cholera usually manifests itself with sudden acute diarrhea and can kill within hours, although three quarters of infected people show no symptoms. The short incubation period means outbreaks can spread with speed, especially in places without safe water and proper sanitation, according to WHO.
