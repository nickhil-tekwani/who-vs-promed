[1] Blood clots

Irish scientists have identified how and why some COVID-19 patients can develop life-threatening blood clots. The work, led by researchers at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI), could lead to targeted therapies that prevent such clots happening in future.

The findings are published in the Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis. The scientists analysed samples from COVID-19 patients in intensive care in the Beaumont Hospital in Dublin. They found the balance between a molecule that causes clotting called the von Willebrand Factor (VWF) and its regulator, ADANTS 13, is severely disrupted in COVID patients who had elevated levels of the VWF protein.

"Our research helps provide insights into the mechanisms that cause severe blood clots in patients with COVID-19, which is critical in developing more effective treatments," said Dr Jamie O'Sullivan, the study's author and a research lecturer at the RCSI, who describes VWF as a large, sticky adhesive-like protein.

She said more research needed to be done to determine whether targets aimed at correcting the levels of ADAMTS 13 and VWF can lead to successful interventions. "It is important that we continue to develop therapies for patients with COVID-19," she added. "Vaccines will continue to be unavailable to many people throughout the world and it is important that we provide effective treatments to them and to those with breakthrough infections."

[2] USA: missed early cases

A new analysis suggests SARS-CoV-2 may have been present in parts of the USA as early as late December 2019, the New York Times reports. It notes, though, that the study's small sample size may make it difficult to distinguish true and false positives.

As they report in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, the researchers from the US National Institutes of Health's All of Us research project retrospectively tested more than 24 000 blood samples for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Of these samples, 147 had a positive result on one test and 9 of those also had a positive result on a 2nd antibody test. Seven of these 9 samples were from before there were known COVID-19 cases in participants' states, and one collected in early January 2020 in Illinois that indicates the virus may have been present there in late December 2019, as it takes about 2 weeks for antibodies to develop.

This, the Times notes, is in line with previous analyses suggesting that early cases in the USA and elsewhere may have been missed. "It helps us understand a little bit more about the geographic spread of where the virus was in those very early days of the US epidemic," lead author Keri Althoff from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health tells the Wall Street Journal.

"Abstract
"Background
With limited SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity in the US at the start of the epidemic (January - March [2020]), testing was focused on symptomatic patients with a travel history throughout February [2020], obscuring the picture of SARS-CoV-2 seeding and community transmission. We sought to identify individuals with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the early weeks of the US epidemic.

"Methods
"All of Us study participants in all 50 US states provided blood specimens during study visits from [2 Jan 2020 to 18 Mar 2020]. A participant was considered seropositive if they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies on the Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA and the EUROIMMUN SARS-CoV-2 ELISA in a sequential testing algorithm. Sensitivity and specificity of the Abbott and EUROIMMUNE ELISAs and the net sensitivity and specificity of the sequential testing algorithm were estimated with 95% confidence intervals.

"Results
'The estimated sensitivity of Abbott and EUROIMMUN was 100% (107/107 [96.6%, 100%]) and 90.7% (97/107 [83.5%, 95.4%]), respectively. The estimated specificity of Abbott and EUROIMMUN was 99.5% (995/1,000 [98.8%, 99.8%]) and 99.7% (997/1,000 [99.1%, 99.9%), respectively. The net sensitivity and specificity of our sequential testing algorithm was 90.7% (97/107 [83.5%, 95.4%]) and 100.0% (1,000/1,000 [99.6%, 100%]), respectively. Of the 24,079 study participants with blood specimens from January 2 to March 18, 2020, 9 were seropositive, 7 of whom were seropositive prior to the first confirmed case in the states of Illinois, Massachusetts, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Mississippi.

"Conclusions
"Our findings indicate SARS-CoV-2 infections weeks prior to the first recognized cases in 5 US states."

[3] Copa America
Date: Mon 14 Jun 2021

https://www.espn.com/soccer/copa-america/story/4409035/copa-america-coronavirus-cases-among-workers-at-team-hotels-in-brazil


Brazil's Ministry of Health said on Monday [14 Jun 2021] that 31 players and Copa America delegation members had tested positive for COVID-19 by Sunday [13 Jun 2021], the 1st day of the South American tournament. Another 10 cases were confirmed among employees working at hotels where the players and their delegations are staying in Brasilia, Health Minister Marcelo Queiroga told reporters.

Among the previously known cases were 2 members of the Colombia delegation, as well as 8 from Venezuela and 3 from Bolivia. Confirmation of more cases of infection came as the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) defended itself against accusations that the tournament, which was awarded to Brazil with less than 2 weeks' notice, was cobbled together at the last minute.

Speaking before their match against Chile, Argentina star Lionel Messi said the fear of contracting the virus was widespread in the squad. "It worries us because it is a risk for everyone catching COVID-19," he told reporters on Monday [14 Jun 2021]. "We try to be careful but it's not easy. These things happen. We'll try to do all we can so no one gets it but sometimes it doesn't depend solely on ourselves."

Brazil was picked after Colombia was withdrawn due to a wave of civil unrest and co-hosts Argentina pulled out because of a surge in COVID-19 cases. The oldest international tournament in the world, the Copa America final is at the Maracana stadium in Rio de Janeiro on 10 Jul 2021.

[4] Contaminated food packaging
Date: Wed 16 Jun 2021
Source: The Standard [edited]
https://www.thestandard.com.hk/sections-news-print/231225/Mutant-virus-found-on-croc-meat-packaging


The wrapping of prepackaged frozen crocodile meat in the fridge at the Tin Shui Wai home of a family hit by a highly contagious mutant variant of COVID-19 has tested positive for the coronavirus. The sample taken from the surface of the wrapping showed up as positive yesterday [15 Jun 2021] and the Centre for Food Safety was trying to trace the source.

But experts said it was likely a 17-year-old girl, who was the 1st confirmed victim, or her 20-year-old sister or their 53-year-old mother -- infected in turn with the Alpha variant first discovered in Britain -- had contaminated the Thailand-sourced meat wrapping rather than the other way round.

Health authorities on Monday [14 Jun 2021] collected more than 60 samples from the home at Shing Yu House in Tin Shing Court including 3 from the frozen compartment of the refrigerator, from a pet shop in Mong Kok and at Tak Wing Industrial Building in Tuen Mun, where the teenager had tutorials.

Only the sample on the crocodile meat came back positive. Crocodile meat is used in traditional Chinese medicine against respiratory problems like asthma and to alleviate coughing.

Government adviser David Hui Shu-cheong from Chinese University said the teenager told Center for Health Protection staff that she had sneezed into the fridge, so he believed it was likely the girl had contaminated the meat wrapping.

Infectious diseases expert Ho Pak-leung from the University of Hong Kong agreed, saying it was extremely unlikely the family had been infected by the packaging. The teenager "had a high viral load in the respiratory tract," Ho noted, "and when at home she did not wear a mask or wash her hands frequently. When she opened the fridge, she could have contaminated objects inside with her hands."

He reminded people to wash cutting boards and knives with detergent after using them to cut frozen meat and to wash their hands before touching cooked food.

Respiratory specialist Leung Chi-chiu said if samples taken from the crocodile meat inside the packaging also tested positive it would be a firm pointer, but that was a vague possibility. Leung also suggested testing staff at the Mong Kok pet shop, where the teen bought a chinchilla cat, and see whether they had antibodies.

Another government adviser, Yuen Kwok-yung from HKU, said it was too early to make a firm call on the crocodile meat and the wrapping and on any part they played in the family infections.

In May last year [2020] a group of workers who fixed labels on Marks & Spencers' prepackaged chilled food imported from Britain at Kerry Logistics' warehouse in Kwai Chung were infected with COVID-19. Authorities said at the time the chilled food could have picked up the virus on the wrapping at the production plant or during shipping. As the food was frozen there was a controlled temperature for a virus to survive.

Meanwhile, Hong Kong yesterday [15 Jun 2021] saw 2 imported cases from Indonesia, taking its tally to 11 881, including 210 deaths. But it was an 8th straight day without a local infection.

One of the Indonesia cases involved the more infectious L452R mutant strain -- also in the Delta variant first found in India. Authorities said they were moving Indonesia from the "high" to the "very high" risk category from Monday. After that travelers from the country -- vaccinated or not -- must show negative COVID-19 test results within 72 hours before a flight and undergo a 21-day quarantine upon arrival.

[It will be hard to sort out whether the patient infected the packaging by sneezing into the refrigerator, or whether it was contaminated during packaging. She was not wearing a mask or gloves and had a high viral load in her respiratory tract, so the former seems most likely. - Mod.LK]

[5] Israel: vaccine protection of unvaccinated
Date: Thu 10 Jun 2021

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01407-5


Citation: Milman O, Yelin I, Aharony N, et al. Community-level evidence for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine protection of unvaccinated individuals. Nat Med. Epub 10 Jun 2021. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01407-5

Abstract
--------
Mass vaccination has the potential to curb the current COVID-19 pandemic by protecting individuals who have been vaccinated against the disease and possibly lowering the likelihood of transmission to individuals who have not been vaccinated. The high effectiveness of the widely administered BNT162b vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech in preventing not only the disease but also infection with SARS-CoV-2 suggests a potential for a population-level effect, which is critical for disease eradication. However, this putative effect is difficult to observe, especially in light of highly fluctuating spatiotemporal epidemic dynamics. Here, by analyzing vaccination records and test results collected during the rapid vaccine rollout in a large population from 177 geographically defined communities, we find that the rates of vaccination in each community are associated with a substantial later decline in infections among a cohort of individuals aged under 16  years, who are unvaccinated. On average, for each 20  percentage points of individuals who are vaccinated in a given population, the positive test fraction for the unvaccinated population decreased approximately 2-fold. These results provide observational evidence that vaccination not only protects individuals who have been vaccinated but also provides cross-protection to unvaccinated individuals in the community.

Main
----
In this study, we identified a strong negative association between vaccination rate at the community level and the risk of infection for unvaccinated members of the community. We find that high vaccination rates were associated with lower infection rates at later time points among the unvaccinated cohort. Although the observed vaccine-associated protection of the unvaccinated population is encouraging, further studies are required to understand whether and how vaccination campaigns might support the prospect of herd immunity and disease eradication.

[There are a number of confounding factors in this study, one of the main ones being "individual behavior and public policy guidelines, including enforcement and compliance with a lockdown imposed between 8  Jan and 7  Feb  2021, might correlate with vaccination rates and also affect the infection potential of the unvaccinated group." More study is needed to clarify this and further elucidate the interesting observations made here. - Mod.LK]

Abstract
--------
Over one year after its inception, the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains difficult to control despite the availability of several excellent vaccines. Progress in controlling the pandemic is slowed by the emergence of variants that appear to be more transmissible and more resistant to antibodies (1,2 [see source URL for complete references]). Here we report on a cohort of 63 COVID-19-convalescent individuals assessed at 1.3, 6.2 and 12 months after infection, 41% of whom also received mRNA vaccines (3,4). In the absence of vaccination antibody reactivity to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, neutralizing activity and the number of RBD-specific memory B cells remain relatively stable from 6 to 12 months. Vaccination increases all components of the humoral response, and as expected, results in serum neutralizing activities against variants of concern that are comparable to or greater than neutralizing activity against the original Wuhan Hu-1 achieved by vaccination of naive individuals (2,5-8). The mechanism underlying these broad-based responses involves ongoing antibody somatic mutation, memory B cell clonal turnover, and development of monoclonal antibodies that are exceptionally resistant to SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutations, including those found in variants of concern (4,9). In addition, B cell clones expressing broad and potent antibodies are selectively retained in the repertoire over time and expand dramatically after vaccination. The data suggest that immunity in convalescent individuals will be very long lasting and that convalescent individuals who receive available mRNA vaccines will produce antibodies and memory B cells that should be protective against circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Discussion
----------
The remarkable evolution of breadth after infection and the robust enhancement of serologic responses and B cell memory achieved with mRNA vaccination suggests that convalescent individuals who are vaccinated should enjoy high levels of protection against emerging variants without a need to modify existing vaccines. If memory responses evolve in a similar manner in naive individuals that receive vaccines, additional appropriately timed boosting with available vaccines should lead to protective immunity against circulating variants.
