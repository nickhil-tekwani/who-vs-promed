The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) has confirmed
5 new human laboratory cases of Rift Valley fever (RVF). This pushes
up the number of confirmed cases to 87. Of the 87 confirmed cases, 68
cases and 4 deaths are from the Free State, 7 [cases] from the
Eastern Cape, 11 cases and 2 deaths from the Northern Cape and one
[case] from the North West province.

The Departments of Health and Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries,
supported by the South African Field Epidemiology and Training
Programme (SA-FELTP) and NICD continue to respond to the outbreak.
"Laboratory, epidemiology and surveillance interventions, health
promotion interventions, environmental health measures, and
management of confirmed cases are being prioritised," said the
Department of Health.

Direct contact with RVF-infected livestock or farms linked to
confirmed animal cases of RVF remain the main risk factor for the
infection. The human cases are farmers, veterinarians and farm
workers. Additional suspect cases are currently being tested.

Affected farms are primarily clustered within the Free State, and the
Department of Agriculture in the province has started the vaccination
of animals to contain the spread of the virus. The Eastern Cape,
Gauteng, Northern Cape and North West provinces have also reported
RVF among animals.

The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and causes termination of
gestation and deaths of young livestock. Humans become infected from
contact with infected tissues of livestock and less frequently from
mosquito bites. The department has urged people living in the
affected areas to seek medical attention at their nearest health
facilities should they have any symptoms.

[The outbreak remains centered in Free State province. The number of
human cases has increased from the 82 cases recorded on Fri 3 Apr
2010 to 87 and the number of human deaths from 5 to 6. The additional
death was recorded in Northern Cape province. The number of human
cases remains low in comparison with previous outbreaks, but the
number of deaths is unusual, since Rift Valley fever in humans is
generally a mild infection.
