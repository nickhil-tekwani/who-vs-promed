A woman on the Indonesian island of Sumatra caught the H5N1 bird flu
virus from poultry in May last year [2006] and passed it to
relatives. A new study by a US university has apparently confirmed
for the 1st time that bird flu has been transmitted from human to
human. It is the nightmare possibility that health authorities have
been fearing ever since the disease 1st appeared.
It happened in Indonesia last year [2006] and reveals the world only
narrowly avoided a global bird flu pandemic.
Researchers from the University of Washington have studied the case
of a woman on the Indonesian island of Sumatra who caught the H5N1
bird flu virus from poultry in May last year [2006].
Professor Ira Longini, who led the research, says they have confirmed
that not only did she pass the virus on to her 10-year-old nephew,
but also it was then transmitted to other relatives.
Of 8 family members who caught the disease, 7 were soon dead. "This
proves there is person-to-person transmission in this case, in that
setting, in Indonesia, northern Sumatra," he said. Professor Longini
says this shows there is a serious threat of a bird flu pandemic.
"It could happen and will happen eventually, and this simply confirms
this particular H5N1 virus is capable of person-to-person
transmission," he said.
"The other thing it says is that we need to be very vigilant to find
these clusters, to assess whether there's transmission and to stop
transmission as quickly as we can each time they arise.
"We're going to see strains of influenza that are capable of causing
pandemics arising, probably avian strains, and that will happen for
sure, there's no doubt about it."
Professor Longini says in this case, a pandemic may have been averted
because of the quick action of health authorities or, statistically
at least, it could have been luck.
He said because the sample group was so small, it was impossible to
say how fast the disease could have spread in the workplace or the
street. But he says that in the home, it was a fast mover.
"It had about a one-third chance of transmitting from person to
person due to close contact in that household setting," he said.
Other scientists say the research confirms their suspicions about the disease.
Dr Alan Hampson is a member of the World Health Organisation's (WHO)
Pandemic Taskforce and an adviser to the Australian Government on
influenza. "This study has looked at the dynamics of the spread of
the virus in the family environment in Sumatra and has come down with
the conclusion that it clearly does show person-to-person
transmission," he said. "We had already believed that that was
probably the case and we haven't had confirmation through analysis of
the viruses.
"The information relating to those viruses is information that's held
in Indonesia, so we haven't seen that, but what we do believe, from
people who have seen the information, is that that too indicated that
it was person-to-person spread and that the virus was changing as it
spread from one person to another, as we would expect it to do."
Dr Hampson says the Sumatra case could have become a pandemic. "If it
had gone further, we do know that the virus is very good at adapting,
so while on the one hand it may have to go through a number of steps,
if its passage is from one person to another, then that chance is
there," he said.

[The reference cited below provides statistical support for
human-to-human transmission of H5N1 avian influenza during an
outbreak of the virus in infected poultry in Sumatra, Indonesia.
There is no evidence for transmission beyond these secondary cases,
so the current observation remains that this virus is not readily
transmitted among humans currently. Until the sequences on these
human isolates have been compared with sequences of H5N1 viruses from
other places, it cannot be concluded that there has been a
significant mutation of the virus that facilitated human-to-human
transmission. Given the Sumatra situation, intensified surveillance
efforts to detect additional instances of human-to-human transmission
are critically important.
