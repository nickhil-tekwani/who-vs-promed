As tens of thousands of Keralites affected by last month's [August 2018] floods are busy cleaning up their slush-filled homes, a 2nd threat is haunting the state in the form of leptospirosis, commonly known as rat fever. 5 more deaths were reported due to rat fever on [Mon 3 Sep 2018], taking the toll from the disease over the past 5 days alone to more than 3 dozen.

Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that is transmitted chiefly through soil or water contaminated by the urine of the disease-carrying animals. Of those who lost their lives, [2 natives] of Ranni and Eranjikkal, Kozhikode, had been volunteers in the rescue and rehabilitation work in the aftermath of the floods. On [Sun 2 Sep 2018], as many as 10 people had lost their lives in the state due to rat fever. The development is a blow to the tourism prospects of the state, which were slowly showing signs of revival with some international tourists reaching Alappuzha for houseboat rides over the past few days.

Rat fever cases have been reported from different districts, including Kozhikode, Wayanad, Malappuram, Thrissur, Alappuzha, and Kottayam. At the Thrissur Medical College alone, over 50 persons with symptoms of the disease are undergoing treatment. In Malappuram district, nearly 50 people are under observation. The situation is reportedly most severe in Kozhikode district, where close to 100 people are under observation.

Authorities have asked all those who had walked through water -- either as victims or rescuers -- and are now showing symptoms of rat fever, like fever, headache, red eyes, and vomiting, to seek medical help at hospitals.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that occurs worldwide. The disease is transmitted to humans by contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes usually with water or soil contaminated by the urine of infected animals. Carrier animals, such as rats, dogs, or cattle, are mostly asymptomatic but chronically infected with one of the several hundred serovars of pathogenic _Leptospira_. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions. In carrier animals with chronic renal infections, leptospira are excreted in urine for long periods or for the life of the animal.

Leptospira can survive for weeks to months in warm, fresh water, or soil flooded with fresh water. Drinking contaminated water or food can also cause infection. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow flooding after heavy rainfall, for example, during the monsoon season (July-October). - Mod.ML
