Boston, MA - The Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) announced
today test results for West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance. Five birds
infected with West Nile virus were identified, 3 crows in Brookline, and 2
crows in Jamaica Plain. The birds died between 7 & 9 Aug 2000. In
addition, MDPH announced a preliminary result for a crow found dead in
Wellesley on 9 Aug 2000. The Wellesley crow is considered a laboratory
probable West Nile virus infection pending further laboratory test results.
The positive birds from Brookline were infected prior to spraying that has
been conducted in Brookline.

To date, 560 crows have been accepted for testing by the New Jersey
Department of Health and Senior Services' Public Health and Environmental
Laboratory. A total of 89 crows -- 37 found in Bergen, 19 in Middlesex, 9
in Union, 9 in Hudson, 10 in Passaic, 2 in Monmouth and 3 in Essex Counties
-- have tested positive for the presence of the
WNV. At least one crow sample has been submitted from all 21 New Jersey
counties.
A cockatiel, found in Monmouth County on 3 Jul 2000 and taken to a
veterinary hospital on Staten Island 5 Jul 2000, has tested positive for
the presence of the WNV. It is important to note that the cockatiel was
found in the wild, apparently abandoned by, or escaped from its owner and
existed out of doors for an undetermined period of time. When found, the
bird seemed to be in good condition, but became ill approximately 5 days
later and died on 16 Jul 2000. Given the limited information available, it
is not possible to determine where or when it became infected with WNV.
