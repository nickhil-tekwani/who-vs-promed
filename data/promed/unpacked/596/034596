A Catholic Bishop in North Dakota who has hepatitis A may have inadvertently exposed hundreds of people to the virus at 3 masses and a priest convention in late September and early October 2013, according to the North Dakota Department of Health (NDDH) and an Associated Press (AP) report [http://www.ndhan.gov/data/mrNews/Cass%20County%20Hepatitis%20A.pdf].

The NDPH said in a statement yesterday [23 Oct 2013] that people who received communion at the 4 events in Fargo and Jamestown might have been exposed to hepatitis A virus. The AP story said that the bishop of the Diocese of Fargo, who attended the masses and convention, contracted hepatitis from contaminated food while attending a conference in Italy in September [2013].

"The risk of people getting hepatitis A in this situation is low, but the Department of Health felt it was important for people to know about the possible exposure," NDDH Immunization Program Manager Molly Howell said in the statement. She said those who received communion at the events should be tested for hepatitis A only if they have symptoms. A diocesan spokeswoman said that the bishop has been taking time off work since 10 Oct 2013 because of his illness and has improved greatly, according to the AP story.

The NDDH statement noted that hepatitis A is found in the stool of infected persons and can spread when people do not wash their hands thoroughly after using the toilet or changing a diaper or soiled sheets. An infected person is most likely to spread the virus during the 1st 2 weeks before symptoms begin, it said.

[The Associated Press report also stated that the bishop had attended a "Bishops' School" for newly ordained bishops in Rome during September 2013 and had contracted the disease at that time. At least one other bishop in attendance at that meeting had also been diagnosed with hepatitis A virus infection. The vehicle was believed to be a batch of berries served at the school. During the past year, frozen berries have been responsible for outbreaks of hepatitis A virus infection in both Northern Europe and North America. - Mod.CP
