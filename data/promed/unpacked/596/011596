Clinically and laboratory suspected FMD: a notification to practitioners and stakeholders
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Samples received at the Kimron Veterinary Institute from FMD-suspected cattle in Rafah (Gaza strip) have been inoculated onto cell culture; clear cytopathic effect has been recorded but the PCR and ELISA tests used have not detected FMDV serotypes A or O. Therefore, the samples are suspected to be infected by an FMD virus which is not FMDV A or O.

The samples are to be urgently submitted for identification to the WRLFMD at Pirbright.

Practitioners and animal breeders are encouraged to exercise the utmost alertness. Animal transportations from the zone bordering the Gaza strip into Israel have been prohibited.

[Spread of the FMDV SAT2, circulating in Egypt since early February 2012 into the Gaza strip, is not a striking surprise. An outbreak of the FMD SAT2 virus has been reported earlier this month in El-Arish, on the north of Egypt's governorate North Sinai, about 40 km (25 miles) from Rafah which is situated on the border between Egypt and the Gaza strip (Palestinian Autonomous Territories, PAT); maps at http://healthmap.org/r/2c2N, http://www.fallingrain.com/world/GZ/00/Rafah.html and http://www.maplandia.com/gaza-strip/rafah/.

Israel has precautionarily vaccinated susceptible animals last week within a 10km (6.2mile) wide zone around the Gaza strip and along the border with North Sinai; the quantities of FMDV SAT2 vaccine available in Israel are rather limited and far from being sufficient for a general vaccination. The number of susceptible animals within the Gaza strip is estimated to be 20 000 bovine and 70 000 small ruminants. To the best of our knowledge, these animals have been vaccinated only against FMDV serotypes A, O and Asia 1 (small ruminants only A and O).

The Kimron Veterinary Institute maintains a high-security, BSL3 FMD laboratory with the current potential capacity to produce up to 180 000 cattle doses (360 000 sheep/goat doses) of FMD vaccine per week. The facility was active in (emergency vaccine) production until 2005; its immediate reactivation deserves serious consideration.

The results of the sequencing of the Egyptian FMDV SAT 2 strain are not yet publicly available on the web-site of the WRLFMD. However, the genotyping results of the recent Libyan strain, which is most probably not significantly different, have now become available (the Libyan consent to allow publication is commended). The most closely related reference viruses are SAT2/CAR/8/2005 (89.66 percent identity) and SAT2/SAU/6/2000 (AF367135) (89.64 percent identity), both belonging to topotype VII. See at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2012/WRLFMD-2012-00010%20SAT2%20Libya%202012.pdf.

Further details on the animal populations of Israel and the PAT are available in posting 20120405.1091576.

Confirmation and final identity of the suspected isolate from Rafah are anticipated with great interest. - Mod.AS.]
