We are talking about the virus H5N8, which was previously observed only in birds, warns Rospotrebnadzor. At the same time, as the head of Rospotrebnadzor, Anna Popova reported today [Tue 31 Oct 2017], Russian scientists confirmed the possibility of asymptomatic human infection with the avian influenza H5N8 virus, which was previously observed only in birds. This confirms that the virus has crossed an interspecies barrier and acquired new properties that may be potentially unsafe for humans, RIA Novosti reported referring to the head of Rospotrebnadzor Anna Popova.

However, at the same time, we found that when examining the blood sera of people who were in contact, they took care of birds in these outbreaks. Antibodies to influenza viruses and H5N1 and H5N8 were found in the blood almost without clinical occurrences, hence the interspecies transition threshold. The head of Rospotrebnadzor expressed hope that in the future this strain will not lead to negative results.

[According to Popova, for scientists this situation will be a motivation for the continuation of observations and research on avian flu. And outbreaks of influenza in birds in the very beginning of 2016 were registered in 48 countries of Asia, Africa, North America and Europe.

As mentioned in the report, Influenza A/H5N8 has been reported previously only from poultry and wildfowl from over 24 countries in Europe, and parts of Asia, Middle East and Africa, and the A(H5N8) virus has been circulating continuously in Asia since 2010 [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/11/161121170044.htm]. According to the WHO assessment 'Human infection with the A(H5N8) virus cannot be excluded, although the likelihood is low, based on the limited information obtained to date. It should be noted that human infection with A(H5N6) of related clade 2.3.4.4 has already occurred'. [http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/avian_influenza/riskassessment_AH5N8_201611/en/].

A report from November 2016 concluded 'Full genome sequencing of recent HPAI A(H5N8) viruses suggest that these viruses remain essentially bird viruses without any specific increased risk for humans. No human infections with this virus have ever been reported world-wide. ECDC's updated rapid risk assessment concludes that the risk of transmission to the general public in Europe is considered to be very low'[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/11/161121170044.htm]. However, based on the available information of other A(H5) subtype viruses, human population immunity against the recently detected A(H5N8) viruses is expected to be minimal.
Continued surveillance for all highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5) viruses will be important to monitor their occurrence and evolution. Timely sharing of representative viruses and sequence information is critical for a complete assessment of the risk posed by these viruses.
Public health advice
- Avoid contact with any birds (poultry or wild birds) or other animals that are sick or are found dead and report them to the relevant authorities.
- Wash hands properly with soap or a suitable disinfectant.
- Follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.
Russia has reported poultry outbreaks with this avian influenza virus since 2014, and this report of a human case mandates a detailed investigation in to underlying factors. - Mod.UBA
