State of emergency against coffee rust disease
----------------------------------------------
Peru has declared a state of emergency in 11 regions against the disease coffee rust (_Hemileia vastatrix_). It follows the detection of new cases in various areas across the country. The Ministry of Agriculture has issued a decree.

[Coffee leaf rust (CLR; also called orange rust) is caused by the fungus _Hemileia vastatrix_, one of the most feared pathogens of the crop. Of the 2 coffee species grown commercially, _Coffea arabica_ (arabica or highland coffee) and _C. canephora_ (robusta or lowland coffee), it affects only arabica varieties, which are usually preferred for their taste. The rust has completely destroyed coffee industries in several countries. The disease is characterised by yellow-orange powdery lesions on the underside of leaves, where it attacks through stomata, but it rarely occurs on stems or fruit. CLR can lead to complete defoliation with death of the host plant.

Fungal spores are spread by wind, rain, and mechanical means. Disease management relies mainly on multiple fungicide applications during the rainy season. Rust-resistant cultivars exist, but the crop is generally of poorer quality. More than 30 races of the fungus have been detected, making it particularly difficult to establish durable host resistance.

The emergence in Central America of a new fungal strain adapted to higher altitude conditions, which may also show additional fungicide resistances, is making CLR control in the region considerably more difficult. The new strain has also recently been identified in Mexico (ProMED-mail post 20140128.2236486). The current outbreak in the region is regarded as one of the most severe attacks of the fungus on record worldwide.

A new more aggressive leaf rust strain is also suspected to be emerging in Colombia (see ProMED-mail posts 20100526.1745, 20091008.3490, and 20090225.0773) and may also be involved in the problems reported above for Peru. Information on the strain(s) involved in an outbreak in Jamaica is still needed.
