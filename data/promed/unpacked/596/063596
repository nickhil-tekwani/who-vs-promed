Abstract
--------
An outbreak of a disease in camels with skin lesions was reported in Israel during 2016. To identify the etiological agent of this illness, we employed a multidisciplinary diagnostic approach. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of lesion material revealed the presence of an orthopox-like virus, based on its characteristic brick shape. The virus from the skin lesions successfully infected chorioallantoic membranes and induced cytopathic effect in Vero cells, which were subsequently positively stained by an orthopox-specific antibody. The definite identification of the virus was accomplished by 2 independent qPCR, one of which was developed in this study, followed by sequencing of several regions of the viral genome. The qPCR and sequencing results confirmed the presence of camelpox virus (CMLV), and indicated that it is different from the previously annotated CMLV sequence available from GenBank. This is the 1st reported case of CMLV in Israel, and the 1st description of the isolated CMLV subtype.

[Camelpox, a widespread infectious viral disease of Old World camelids, is an OIE-listed disease. New World camelids are also susceptible. It occurs throughout the camel-breeding areas of Africa, north of the equator, the Middle East and Asia, and has an important economic impact through loss of production and sometimes death. Camelpox does not occur in the feral camel population of Australia. The camelpox virus belongs to the family _Poxviridae_, subfamily _Chordopoxvirinae_, genus _Orthopoxvirus_.

The disease is characterised by fever, local or generalised pox lesions on the skin and in the mucous membranes of the mouth and respiratory tract. The clinical manifestations range from inapparent infection to mild, moderate and, less commonly, severe systemic infection and death.

The disease occurs more frequently and more severely in young animals and pregnant females. Transmission is by either direct contact between infected and susceptible animals or indirect infection via a contaminated environment. The role of insects in transmission has been suspected because the disease is often observed after rainfall. Camelpox virus is very host specific and does not infect other animals.

Zoonotic camelpox virus infection in humans associated with outbreaks in dromedary camels (_Camelus dromedaries_) was described in the north eastern region of India during 2009. This was a single incident illustrating that camelpox is of limited public health importance.

The above and additional information on camel-pox is available in OIE's Manual at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.09.02_CAMELPOX.pdf.

The paper referred to in this posting includes the following "case description and clinical signs":

"In the summer of 2016, a disease with skin manifestation was reported in camels in the southern part of Israel. Infected animals were reported in 2 herds in the Beâ€²er-Sheba district, one in the Tel-Arad region, and one in the Hebron region. Inspected herds of mainly adult females exhibited symptoms including weakness, loss of appetite, fever, abortions, and multifocal lesions on the skin [for picture, please go to the source, fig 1A-D]. During the initial stages of the disease, stiff papules were observed, while at the advanced stage became ulcerated with purulent secretion. No mortalities were reported, and the inspected animals recovered after a few weeks. There were no subsequent reports of further spread of the disease. No infections in husbandry personnel were reported. In order to identify the etiologic agent, skin samples from 8 representative camels were subjected to various diagnostic tests".

Indeed this is the 1st laboratory-confirmed camel pox event in Israel.

Previously (ref 1; Hebrew, English summary), an outbreak of camel pox was reported in January-March 1972 in Israel's southern region, Hadarom (the Negev). Mortality of 10-15 per cent was seen among young animals; the typical lesions were in line with description in the literature, involving mainly the head, abdomen and unhaired body parts (armpits). In several animals, edema of the head developed, leading in severe cases to ocular involvement and blindness. The diagnosis during this event was based upon clinical signs and gross pathology observations. The English summary said: "The infectious camel diseases observed (in the Negev) since 1949 included rabies, camel pox, FMD, salmonellosis and trypanosomiasis."

Sheep, goat, horse and camel pox are officially notifiable animal diseases in Israel.

According to Israel's report to the OIE (2016 data), the country's camel population is about 3500, practically all of them in the Negev.
