The eastern equine encephalitis virus [EEEV] has been discovered in mosquitoes for the 1st time this year [2020] in Massachusetts, health officials said.

EEEV was confirmed by the Massachusetts State Public Health Laboratory in a mosquito sample collected on 1 Jul [2020] in the town of Orange in Franklin County, officials said Friday [3 Jul 2020]. No human or animal cases of EEE have been detected so far this year [2020], officials said.

The mosquito-borne disease is a rare but a potentially deadly disease. There were 12 human cases in Massachusetts in 2019 with 6 deaths. There were also 9 cases in domestic animals.

Public Health Commissioner Monica Bharel said the state has been preparing for a resurgence of EEE. Surveillance will help health officials determine how quickly the virus might emerge this year [2020].

[Because last year (2019) was an unusually active year for EEEV transmission, with cases in humans and in horses, the report above is posted to alert people and horse owners that the virus is present again in vector mosquitoes in Massachusetts. As mentioned in many previous ProMED-mail posts, horse owners in eastern and upper midwestern states should vaccinate their animals now if they have not done so already. There is no commercially available vaccine for humans, so avoidance of mosquito bites is the only preventive measure to take.

Additional information on EEE is available on the CDC website at https://www.cdc.gov/EasternEquineEncephalitis/. - Mod.TY
