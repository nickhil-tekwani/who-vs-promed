This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (3)
Outbreak 1: Rio Iglesia, Rio Iglesias, Chepigana, Darien
Date of start of the outbreak: 25 Jun 2015
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Village
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Equidae / 23 / 7 / 2 / 0 / 0
Affected population: native animals (breed undetermined) used for work

Outbreak 2: Juancalito, Chepigana, Seteganti, Darien
Date of start of the outbreak: 25 Jun 2015
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Village
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Equidae / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0

Outbreak 3: Canglon, Pinogana Meteti, Darien
Date of start of the outbreak: 4 Aug 2015
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Village
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Equidae / 8 / 2 / 0 / 0 / 0

Summary of outbreaks: total outbreaks: 3
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Equidae / 32 / 10 / 2 / 0 / 0
Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:
Species / morbidity rate / mortality rate / case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Equidae / 31.25 / 6.25 / 20 / 6.25
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive, vectors

Epidemiological comments: Zones endemic and with cyclical occurrence of the disease where campaigns for vector control and vaccination of susceptible species are carried out. Paired tests are being made to rule out the presence of the disease after recent vaccination. Laboratory results pending. 4 animals at the Rio Iglesias outbreak tested positive for Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis [VEE] [Note: According to the OIE's database, VEE has been reported as absent, last occurrence July 2010]

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; vaccination in response to the outbreak (s); disinfection/disinfestations; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone ; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; control of vectors; no treatment of affected animals.
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Gorgas Memorial Institute for Health Studies (Regional Reference Laboratory) / Equidae / IgM-capture ELISA / 3 Sep 2015 / Positive

Future reporting:
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

The location of the outbreak can be seen on the interactive map included in the OIE report at the source URL above.

["Eastern and western equine encephalomyelitis viruses belong to the genus _Alphavirus_ of the family Togaviridae. Alternate infection of birds and mosquitoes maintain these viruses in nature. The disease occurs sporadically in horses and humans from mid-summer to late autumn. Horses and humans are tangential dead-end hosts. The disease in horses is characterised by fever, anorexia, and severe depression. In severe cases, the disease in horses progresses to hyperexcitability, blindness, ataxia, severe mental depression, recumbency, convulsions, and death. Eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) virus infection in horses is often fatal, while western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) virus can cause a subclinical or mild disease with less than 30 per cent mortality. EEE and WEE have been reported to cause disease in poultry, game birds, and ratites [large, flightless birds, ostriches, emus, etc]. Sporadic cases of EEE have been reported in cows, sheep, pigs, deer, and dogs.

EEE has been diagnosed in Quebec and Ontario in Canada, central and eastern regions of the United States of America (USA), the Caribbean Islands, Mexico, and Central and South America".

For the above and additional background information including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to OIE Terrestrial Manual 2015, Chapter 2.5.5 "Equine encephalomyelitis (Easter and Western)" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.05.05_EQUINE_ENCEPH.pdf (version adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2013).

Unfortunately human cases have also been detected in the same area where animal cases were identified (see report below)

Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito.

"EEEV is maintained in a cycle between _Culiseta melanura_ mosquitoes and avian hosts in freshwater hardwood swamps. _Cs. melanura_ is not an important vector of EEE virus to humans because it feeds almost exclusively on birds. Transmission to humans requires mosquito species capable of creating a "bridge" between infected birds and uninfected mammals such as some _Aedes_, _Coquillettidia_, and _Culex_ species.

EEEV infection in humans can result in 1 of 2 types of illness, systemic or encephalitic (EEE). Systemic infection has an abrupt onset and is characterized by chills, fever, malaise, arthralgia, and myalgia. The illness lasts 1-2 weeks; recovery is complete when there is no central nervous system involvement. In infants, the encephalitic form is characterized by abrupt onset; in older children and adults, encephalitis is manifested after a few days of systemic illness. Signs and symptoms in encephalitic patients are fever, headache, irritability, restlessness, drowsiness, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, cyanosis, convulsions, and coma.

No specific antiviral treatment for EEEV infections is available. Patients with suspected EEE should be hospitalized, appropriate serologic and other diagnostic tests ordered, and supportive treatment provided. About 1/3 of those who develop EEE die. Many of those who survive will have mild to severe permanent neurologic damage. Additional information is available at http://www.cdc.gov/EasternEquineEncephalitis/tech/factSheet.html.

It is important to note that in the epidemiological comment section of this immediate report it is indicated that "4 animals at the Rio Iglesias outbreak tested positive for Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis [VEE]". According to information found in the OIE database through 2013, VEE had been reported as absent with the last occurrence reported in July 2010 (See http://tinyurl.com/nbdhbas and http://tinyurl.com/ogfqys3). For 2014 and 2015, there are no available 6-monthly reports. It might be helpful to have more information on the occurrence of VEE in Panama, either through the submission of subsequent immediate reports, or by updating their 6-monthly reports.

Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis is an arthropod-borne inflammatory viral infection of equines and humans, resulting in mild to severe febrile and, occasionally fatal, encephalitic disease.http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.05.13_VEE.pdf.
