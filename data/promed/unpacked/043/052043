Syrian Doctors Present Evidence of New Chlorine Gas Attacks to US Congress
--------------------
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is again systematically using chemical weapons to kill, terrorize and disperse civilians in rebel-held areas - Syrian doctors and human rights activists told a U.S. congressional committee Wed [17 Jun 2015].

President Assad had denied the use of chemical weapons, saying there is no evidence. In response to earlier pressure, Assad declared that he had gotten rid of his entire stockpile of chemical weapons. But Dr. Mohamed Tennari of the Syrian-American Medical Society told members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee that the Syrian military began launching helicopter attacks using chlorine gas on 16 Mar 2015 in his hometown of Sarmin.

Tennari showed the committee disturbing video of dead and wounded children and others from that night, and told what he saw when he went to the hospital to treat the injured. "Dozens of people experienced difficulty breathing, with their eyes and throats burning, and many began secreting from the mouth," he said. "We lay people on the floor as the beds filled up. Our small field hospital became chaotic."

Tennari presented the panel a dossier of data, photos and other evidence documenting 31 separate chlorine gas attacks in Syria since March 2015. The witnesses emphasized that only the Syrian leader has the helicopters to deliver the barrel bombs with chlorine gas. Dr. Annie Sparrow of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai works in the region to train doctors, and said she has never seen anything like this. "I am a doctor, and I am very familiar with death,' she said. "But I have never seen a more obscene way to kill children."

Lawmakers, including Representative Elliot Engel, were visibly shaken by the images. "I am not usually speechless. But after watching those pictures of the children dying, I am speechless," he said. Engel said he and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce have asked the Pentagon to seriously consider leading efforts to establish a no-fly zone in Syria. Royce said such a zone would protect civilians from the deadly combination of barrel bombs and chlorine gas dropped by aircraft. "Syrians would no longer be forced to choose between staying above ground where they could be killed by the shrapnel Assad packs inside his barrel bombs or going below ground where they are more vulnerable to suffocating from chlorine gas," he said. Royce said if the United States and its regional allies would set up a no-fly zone, deciding to go to school or the market would no longer be a life-or-death decision for Syrians.

But other lawmakers, such as Democratic Representative Albio Sires, said he is reluctant to have the United States get involved in a conflict with the Syrian government. He asked why Syria's Arab neighbors don't do anything to protect suffering civilians. Asked about a no-fly zone, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, rejected the idea at a House hearing Tuesday. Power said President Barack Obama believes the risk of a direct confrontation with the Syrian military is too high.

[The descriptions of choking, burning eyes and what may be salivation can fit chlorine gas. The "secreting from their mouth" may also be from the lungs which are adversely affected by chlorine gas.

Breathing small amounts of chlorine for short periods of time adversely affects the human respiratory system. Effects differ from coughing and chest pain, to water retention in the lungs. Chlorine irritates the skin, the eyes, and the respiratory system. These effects are not likely to occur at levels of chlorine that are normally found in the environment.

Human health effects associated with breathing or otherwise consuming small amounts of chlorine over long periods of time are not known. Some studies show that some workers develop adverse effects from repeat inhalation exposure to chlorine, but others will not.

Chlorine was used during World War I as a choking (pulmonary) agent. During or immediately after exposure to dangerous concentrations of chlorine, the following signs and symptoms may develop:
- Blurred vision
- Burning pain, redness, and blisters on the skin if exposed to gas.
- Skin injuries similar to frostbite can occur if it is exposed to liquid chlorine
- Burning sensation in the nose, throat, and eyes
- Coughing
- Chest tightness
- Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. These may appear immediately if high concentrations of chlorine gas are inhaled, or they may be delayed if low concentrations of chlorine gas are inhaled.
- Fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) that may be delayed for a few hours
- Nausea and vomiting
- Watery eyes
- Wheezing

Showing these signs or symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to chlorine.

Long-term complications may occur after breathing in high concentrations of chlorine. Complications are more likely to be seen in people who develop severe health problems such as fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) following the initial exposure.

No antidote exists for chlorine exposure. Treatment consists of removing the chlorine from the body as soon as possible (generally washing the individual) and providing supportive medical care such as inhaled breathing treatments (most frequently oxygen) for wheezing in a hospital setting - Mod.TG]

[Historically, chlorine gas was used by both sides during the First World War, and was notorious for blowing back on the users. - Mod.JW
