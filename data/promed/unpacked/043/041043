Officials say that they have identified the culprit behind a massive carp die-off last month [May 2012] at Blue Springs Lake [Missouri].

According to the Missouri Department of Conservation, the koi herpesvirus (KHV) killed approximately 16 000 carp at the Jackson County lake -- or about 75 percent of the carp in the lake.

Officials say that KHV is named for koi, a fish commonly kept in aquariums and aquaculture. Koi are ornamental varieties of common carp that have been bred for varying colors and fin shapes. KHV most commonly occurs in hatchery operations with large numbers of fish.

The virus affects only the common carp species but goldfish can be carriers without showing symptoms of the virus. The virus cannot be transmitted to humans, officials said.

Fish biologists say that carp are an exotic, invasive species in Missouri, and that popular native fish such as largemouth bass, bluegill, crappie, and catfish should actually benefit due to less competition for food and less habitat destruction by carp.

Biologists say that the virus has a short incubation period, spreads rapidly from fish to fish, but is only lethal to common carp. There is no treatment for this disease. The virus is fairly well established in North America. Similar outbreaks have occurred in Michigan, New York, Indiana, California, Ontario (Canada), and Arizona.

The virus could have been introduced by someone dumping unwanted bait, koi, or goldfish into the lake, officials said.

Officials with the Department of Conservation say that the large population of carp at Blue Springs Lake, in combination with ideal water temperatures, led to the die-off.

Conservation officials say that the lake remains safe for fishing, boating, and swimming.

[Since Koi herpesvirus disease (KHD) in common carp (_Cyprinus carpio_) was detected in Israel and Germany in 1998, the disease has been reported throughout the world. The disease is transmitted by fish-to-fish contact and it is also possible that the disease can spread through contaminated water, nets, and other equipment. As other herpesvirus, KHD has the capacity to remain latent in the infected fish and become activated and cause disease when some stressors trigger it.

More information on KHD is found in OIE Aquatic Manual chapter (2009 update), which is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/2010/2.3.06_KHVD.pdf.
