FMD suspected in Erbid
----------------------
The Erbid province animal resources department manager has indicated
that foot and mouth disease (FMD) is not widespread in the province.
He has confirmed that the reported cases of FMD were only sporadic.
He also stated that the department has assigned a special task force
to monitor the sanitary situation in the province, and to isolate and
vaccinate infected herds. Also, he attributed the appearance of such
FMD cases to the movement of livestock during the Eid Aladhaa [festival].

[Details on the location and number of outbreaks in the
north-Jordanian Irbid district, as well as on the affected species,
the virulence of the disease, the vaccination/immunity status of the
infected animals, and any available information on the serotype
involved, are anticipated the earliest.

FMD displays, for reasons yet to be clarified, a seasonal pattern in
the region, starting in December and in most years peaking in April-May.

The World reference laboratory for FMD at Pirbright identified, in
December 2006, FMDV serotypes A and O in samples from Jordan. - Mod.AS]
