Ebola hemorrhagic fever in Gabon/The Republic of Congo - WHO update 10
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
As of Sun 30 Dec 2001, 30 confirmed cases (14 laboratory and 16
epidemiologically linked), including 22 deaths, have been reported. An
additional 5 suspected cases are under investigation in Gabon. All contacts
(having direct or suspected contact with the blood or other body fluids of
a case) are being closely monitored for signs or symptoms of Ebola
hemorrhagic fever for 21 days.
Currently, 182 contacts are under active follow up. We anticipate one or
more cases may develop among these contacts. Of the 30 cases, 18 were
detected in Gabon and 12 in the neighbouring villages of the Republic of
the Congo [a detailed map of the area can be accessed at the above URL).
As of Sun 30 Dec 2001, 89 contacts are being followed up in Gabon and 93 in
the Republic of the Congo. The international team is operational on both
sides of the border and is working closely in the field with the teams from
the Congolese and Gabonese Ministries of Health on outbreak control
interventions.

[Since the previous WHO report [released on Fri 28 Dec 2001, the number of
confirmed cases has increased by one (in Gabon), and the death toll has
risen from 20 to 22. The number of laboratory confirmed cases has risen
from 12 to 14. In the 3 days from Thu 27 Dec to Sun 30 Dec 2001, the number
of contacts under surveillance has fallen from 206 to 182; down 2 in Gabon
and down 22 in Republic of Congo. The single new confirmed case in Gabon
may be the case reported by AP on Sat 29 Dec 2001 (see: Ebola hemorrhagic
fever - Gabon/Congo Rep (03) 20011230.3138), who had no known contact with
previous Ebola fever patients; if so it suggests that the outbreak may be
continuing to spread. - Mod.CP
