TUBERCULOSIS, DAIRY CATTLE - USA (NORTH DAKOTA)

Tuberculosis (caused by the bacterium _Mycobacterium bovis_) has been found
in a herd of dairy cows in Morton County, North Dakota, USA.
The herd of 115 cows and 8 calves was tested for tuberculosis (TB). There
were 31 reactors based on compartive cervical reactions. The North Dakota
Agriculture Department (ND Ag Dept) is waiting on confirmation by culture
and PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction). These cattle also had positive
histopatological lesions. There are some families that reportedly drank
raw milk and are being tested. The ND Ag Dept has established a 5mile radius
around the dairy where they will test cattle at dairies and trace animals
that may have been sold or relocated.

[_Mycobacterium bovis_ can cause progressive disease in most warm-blooded
vertebrates, including man. TB can spread to man via ingestion, inhalation
and occupational exposure. It can be spread through milk. Furthermore, with
a number of reactors in a dairy it seems possible that other animals may
have had the disease and been sold or traded, consequently putting other
dairies at risk of the disease. In turn, this may put other people at risk
from occupational exposure and consumption of unpasteurized milk - Mod.TG]
