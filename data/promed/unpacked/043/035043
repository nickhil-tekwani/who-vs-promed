"Smallpox" Cases Suspected in a Village near Tando Bago (Sindh Province)
---------------------------------------------------
TANDO BAGO: The deadly disease smallpox, according to medical science has
long been eradicated from the world. The malady afflicting a 20-year old
villager and his 4-year old nephew in Qasim Magrio, a village near Tando
Bago town, seems to be [similar to] this disease. The disease afflicted them
2 weeks ago, [and they now have festering sores]. They have applied all
sorts of ointments to the wounds, as prescribed by doctors, but in vain.
They were taken to Taluka Hospital, Tando Bago, but the doctors could not
diagnose the mysterious malady. Now the condition of the patients is getting
worse. Dr Ali Ahmed Khatri the medical superintendent of Taluka Hospital,
Tando Bago, talking to The Star said that although smallpox has long since
been eradicated he could not rule out the possibility of its reappearance.
