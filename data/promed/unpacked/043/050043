Thousands of Poultry Culled in East Jakarta
-------------------------------------------
East Jakarta Municipal Administration is very serious about protecting
its citizens from the threat of the H5N1 virus of bird flu. It can be
seen from the number of poultry of various types culled by the local
husbandry and fishery agency from January until July 2010, reaching
1309.

The destroyed poultry consisted of 524 chickens, 345 ducks, and 440
pigeons. Of the number, most destroyed poultry was recorded in
Kramatjati sub-district (403), followed by Cakung (195), Cipayung
(179), Pasarrebo (130), Jatinegara (106), Pulogadung (102), Ciracas
(65), Durensawit (63), Makassar (59), and Matraman (7). In the poultry
destruction procedure, the slaughtered poultry are returned to the
owners.

In addition to culling poultry, the officers also dismantle and burn
poultry cages located within a radius of several meters from
residential areas. It is considered necessary to reassure that public
are really free from poultry. These measures are in line with Bylaw
No.4/2007 on Poultry Control and Distribution in the Jakarta area.

Head of the agency Ahmad Adnan explains that every citizen who lives
in Jakarta is banned from raising poultry within a radius of 25 meters
[82 feet] from residential areas. "Our officers will directly take
action on poultry roaming in residential areas," said Adnan, Friday
[30 Jul 2010].

Adnan said his side really hoped for public participation by reporting
their finding of roaming poultry in residential areas to the local
authorities at sub-district or urban village office. "Actually, people
already understand this regulation, as this issue has previously been
disseminated in each sub-district. So there is no more excuse from
people claiming still unknown about the regulation," he asserted.

[Indonesia and Egypt are the 2 countries where circulation of HPAI
virus H5N1 in animals, and human cases, are continuing. The disease
was officially declared endemic by the Indonesian authorities, in
September 2006. It occurs in most parts of the country.

The high number of reported outbreaks each month is partially
explained by the implementation of the participatory disease
surveillance and response (PDSR) programme that targets village-type
poultry production systems (mainly backyard) and reports evidence of
virus circulation in the village environment.

The culling, as can be seen in a photo accompanying the above media
report, is carried out by throat-cutting/bleeding of the birds.
According to the report, the slaughtered poultry are returned to their
owners, probably for home consumption; but is their possible sale to
others, and movement, controlled/prevented? The policy described may
be the outcome of financial constraints leading to lack of
compensation to owners. Such a killing method is not ideal (to say the
least) also from public health considerations. - Mod.AS]
