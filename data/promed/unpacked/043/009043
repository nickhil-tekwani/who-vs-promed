Abstract
The ability of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 to spread and contaminate is one of the determinants of the COVID-19 pandemic status. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in saliva consistently, with similar sensitivity as observed in nasopharyngeal swabs. We conducted ultrasound-guided postmortem biopsies in COVID-19 fatal cases. Samples of salivary glands (SG; Parotid, Submandibular and Minor) were obtained. We analyzed samples using RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy and histopathological analysis, to identify the SARS-CoV-2 and elucidate qualitative and quantitative viral profiles in salivary glands. The study included 13 female and 11 male patients, with a mean age of 53.12 years (range 8-83). RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2 was positive in 30 SG samples from 18 patients (60% of total SG samples and 75% of all cases). Ultrastructural analyses showed spherical 70-100 nm viral particles, consistent in size and shape with the Coronaviridae family, in the ductal lining cell cytoplasm, acinar cells, and ductal lumen of SG. There was also degeneration of organelles in infected cells and the presence of a cluster of nucleocapsids, which suggests viral replication in SG cells. Qualitative histopathological analysis showed morphologic alterations in the duct lining epithelium characterized by cytoplasmic and nuclear vacuolization, as well as nuclear pleomorphism. Acinar cells showed degenerative changes of the zymogen granules and enlarged nuclei. Ductal epithelium and serous acinar cells showed intense expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS receptors. An anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody was positive in 8 (53%) of the 15 tested cases in duct lining epithelial cells and acinar cells of major SG. Only 2 minor salivary glands were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by immunohistochemistry. Salivary glands are a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 and provide a pathophysiological background for studies that indicate the use of saliva as a diagnostic method for COVID19 and highlight this biological fluid's role in spreading the disease.

[These results support the use of saliva as a diagnostic specimen and demonstrate that saliva is a route of spread of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 appears to be replicating in the salivary glands and is not merely harbored there. Furthermore, cytopathology was evident, further demonstrating the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect and damage diverse organs and tissues. - Mod.LK]

Ref. Pathela P, Crawley A, Weiss D, et al. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 following the largest initial epidemic wave in the United States: Findings from New York City, May 13-July 21, 2020. J Infect Dis. 2021 Apr 9:jiab200. doi: 10.1093/infdis/jiab200. Epub ahead of print. PMID: 33836067.

Abstract
Background: New York City (NYC) was the U.S. epicenter of the Spring 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. We present seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and correlates of seropositivity immediately after the 1st wave.

METHODS: From a serosurvey of adult NYC residents (13 May-21 Jul 2020), we calculated the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies stratified by participant demographics, symptom history, health status, and employment industry. We used multivariable regression models to assess associations between participant characteristics and seropositivity.

RESULTS: Seroprevalence among 45 367 participants was 23.6% (95% CI, 23.2%-24.0%). High seroprevalence (over 30%) was observed among Black and Hispanic individuals, people from high poverty neighborhoods, and people in health care or essential worker industry sectors. COVID-19 symptom history was associated with seropositivity (adjusted relative risk=2.76; 95% CI, 2.65-2.88). Other risk factors included sex, age, race/ethnicity, residential area, employment sector, working outside the home, contact with a COVID-19 case, obesity, and increasing numbers of household members.

CONCLUSIONS: Based on a large serosurvey in a single U.S. jurisdiction, we estimate that just under 1/4th of NYC adults were infected in the 1st few months of the COVID-19 epidemic. Given disparities in infection risk, effective interventions for at-risk groups are needed during ongoing transmission.

[3] Israel: B.1.351 bypasses Pfizer vaccine
Date: Sat 10 Apr 2021
Source: Times of Israel [edited]
https://www.timesofisrael.com/real-world-israeli-data-shows-south-african-variant-better-at-bypassing-vaccine/


The South African variant of the coronavirus is notably more adept at "breaking through" the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine than other variants are, Israeli scientists have found, in a 1st-of-its-kind real-world study.

Israel has used the Pfizer vaccine almost exclusively to vaccinate millions of citizens, with a version by Moderna, based on similar innovative mRNA technology, used minimally.

A team from Tel Aviv University and the Clalit healthcare organization sequenced the swabs of 150 Israelis who tested positive for COVID-19 despite having been vaccinated.

In their study, the prevalence of the South African strain among vaccinated individuals who were infected despite their inoculation was 8 times higher than its prevalence in the unvaccinated infected population. Though the number of such infections among the vaccinated was relatively small, the findings indicated that this variant was far more successful in getting through vaccinated individuals' defenses than other strains.

"Based on patterns in the general population, we would have expected just one case of the South African variant, but we saw 8," Prof. Adi Stern, who headed the research, told The Times of Israel. "Obviously, this result didn't make me happy."

She said that the results show that the South African variant, compared to the original strain and the British variant, "is able to break through the vaccine's protection." However, she said that the sample size is too small to put a figure on its increased ability.

"We can say it's less effective, but more research is needed to establish exactly how much," she said.

Prof. Ran Balicer, director of research at Clalit, said the study was "very important."

"It is the 1st in the world to be based on real-world data, showing that the vaccine is less effective against the South African variant, compared to both the original virus and the British variant," he said.

Balicer added that the results call for continued vigilance against the coronavirus, including social distancing and wearing masks in indoor spaces, to prevent infection.

"These preliminary findings necessitate close continued attention to the dissemination of this strain in Israel, emphasizing the need for epidemiological monitoring and systematic sequencing, in order to contain further spread of the South African variant in Israel," he said.

The research, which has been posted online but not yet peer-reviewed, is likely to raise questions about Pfizer's own real-world study, which found that in South Africa, despite the local strain being prevalent, the vaccine was 100 percent effective [See https://www.forbes.com/sites/palashghosh/2021/04/01/pfizer-biontech-vaccine-protects-against-south-african-variant-highly-effective-against-disease-for-six-months-updated-trial-data-shows/?sh=58dd9b186ff9].

The Tel Aviv research appears to corroborate a recent study from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, which found that the vaccine response is less effective against the South African variant. It drew its conclusion by analyzing blood samples, while the new research is based on actual sequenced test results [See https://www.timesofisrael.com/pfizer-vaccine-less-effective-against-south-african-variant-israeli-study-finds/].

Stern emphasized that the South African variant remains uncommon within the vaccinated population and stressed that the study does not precisely indicate the level of protection against the variant, because its prevalence in Israel is very low, about 1% of all cases.

The study also examined the so-called British variant's ability to break through the vaccine's defenses, compared to the original strain. No difference was found in the UK variant's ability to infect fully vaccinated individuals (after 2 doses). However, it was more able to infect partially vaccinated individuals than the original.

In Israel, the massive spread of the extra-contagious British variant starting in early January 2021 -- to the point that it now accounts for more than 90% of COVID cases -- is believed to have been responsible for a major wave in the 1st months of the year [2021], slowing the exit from the pandemic.

But Stern said it may well have had a silver lining: In the battle between variants, the British one is far stronger, and may well be keeping the South African variant at bay.

"It is possible that the extensive spread of the British variant is blocking the spread of the South African variant," she said. "Because it spread so effectively, it basically didn't allow the South African variant to spread; it won the competition."

With more than half the population fully vaccinated, the pandemic is now on the decline, with new daily infections in the low hundreds.

[It is not clear why the Pfizer study results showed complete protection of the vaccine against B.1.351 variant. The Pfizer study included 800 participants in South Africa. The Israeli study reported here sequenced virus from 150 Israelis who tested positive for COVID-19 despite having been vaccinated. Perhaps the difference is that Pfizer was looking for cases (severe disease?), while the Israeli study was evaluating all individuals who tested positive, thus all cases. - Mod.LK]

[4] Thrombotic events following COVID vaccination

[A] Thrombotic thrombocytopenia following AstraZeneca COVID vaccination: role of anti-PF4 antibodies
Date: 9 Apr 2021
Source: New England Journal of Medicine [edited]
https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2104840


Citation: Greinacher A, Thiele T, Warkentin TE, et al. Thrombosis and Thrombocytopenia after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Vaccination. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2104840

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND
Several cases of unusual thrombotic events and thrombocytopenia have developed after vaccination with the recombinant adenoviral vector encoding the spike protein antigen of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (ChAdOx1 nCov-19, AstraZeneca). More data were needed on the pathogenesis of this unusual clotting disorder.

METHODS
We assessed the clinical and laboratory features of 11 patients in Germany and Austria in whom thrombosis or thrombocytopenia had developed after vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCov-19. We used a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect platelet factor 4 (PF4)-heparin antibodies and a modified (PF4-enhanced) platelet-activation test to detect platelet-activating antibodies under various reaction conditions. Included in this testing were samples from patients who had blood samples referred for investigation of vaccine-associated thrombotic events, with 28 testing positive on a screening PF4-heparin immunoassay.

RESULTS
Of the 11 original patients, 9 were women, with a median age of 36 years (range, 22 to 49). Beginning 5 to 16 days after vaccination, the patients presented with one or more thrombotic events, with the exception of one patient, who presented with fatal intracranial hemorrhage. Of the patients with one or more thrombotic events, 9 had cerebral venous thrombosis, 3 had splanchnic-vein thrombosis, 3 had pulmonary embolism, and 4 had other thromboses; of these patients, 6 died. Five patients had disseminated intravascular coagulation. None of the patients had received heparin before symptom onset. All 28 patients who tested positive for antibodies against PF4-heparin tested positive on the platelet-activation assay in the presence of PF4 independent of heparin. Platelet activation was inhibited by high levels of heparin, Fc receptor-blocking monoclonal antibody, and immune globulin (10 mg per milliliter). Additional studies with PF4 or PF4-heparin affinity purified antibodies in 2 patients confirmed PF4-dependent platelet activation.

CONCLUSIONS
Vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCov-19 can result in the rare development of immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia mediated by platelet-activating antibodies against PF4, which clinically mimics autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. (Funded by the German Research Foundation.)

SUMMARY
We report findings in 5 patients who presented with venous thrombosis and thrombocytopenia 7 to 10 days after receiving the 1st dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 adenoviral vector vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). The patients were healthcare workers who were 32 to 54 years of age. All the patients had high levels of antibodies to platelet factor 4-polyanion complexes; however, they had had no previous exposure to heparin. Because the 5 cases occurred in a population of more than 130 000 vaccinated persons, we propose that they represent a rare vaccine-related variant of spontaneous heparin-induced thrombocytopenia that we refer to as vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia.

[B] AstraZeneca vaccine and Capillary leak syndrome;
J&J vaccine and rare blood clots with low platelets
Date: 9 Apr 2021
Source: Daily Mail [edited]
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9454211/Fresh-blow-AstraZeneca-vaccine-linked-dangerous-blood-condition-Europe.html


Another potentially dangerous blood condition has been spotted in a handful of patients given the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, the EU's drug watchdog has announced.

The European Medicines Authority (EMA) said 5 cases of capillary leak syndrome had been reported in vaccinated patients on the continent.

The rare condition sees blood leak from tiny vessels into muscles and body cavities, resulting in a sudden drop in blood pressure. If left untreated, it can cause organ failure.

Data suggest the UK's regulator, the MHRA, had spotted 3 cases of capillary leak syndrome out of 20 million people given the AstraZeneca vaccine by late March 2021.

It is another blow for the British-made jab, which has been restricted for certain age groups in various countries around the world, including under-30s in Britain, after reports of rare blood clots in the brain and abdomen.

Officials insisted there is still no evidence the jab causes the blood conditions and stressed that the benefits of vaccination far outweighed the risk.

Meanwhile, the EMA revealed it is also reviewing reports of rare clots involving Johnson and Johnson's Covid vaccine, which uses the same technology as AstraZeneca's.

Four serious cases of rare blood clots with low platelets were detected in people vaccinated with the jab, one of which died.

In the US, 4 clinics have had to pause J&J vaccinations, after 8 people suffered adverse reactions in the latest crisis, coming at a site in Cummings, Georgia.

Officials did not specify what types of reactions the 8 people had to the shot, but said they were "consistent with common reactions in adults being vaccinated with any vaccine," and cited the number of cases as the trigger for the pause.

However, the 8 people who had reactions were among 425 people who got the J&J shot at that site and, ostensibly, did not have any noticeable reactions.

The same thing has happened at clinics in 3 other states this week.

J&J vaccinations have now resumed at a Colorado site that reported 11 people had had bad reactions to the one-dose vaccine, and 2 were taken to hospitals on Wednesday [7 Apr 2021], as well as at a North Carolina site where 18 people had reactions. Four were taken to hospitals.

"The reactions people experienced today were consistent with known common side effects from receiving the vaccine," Wake County officials said in a statement about the adverse reactions at PNC Arena in Raleigh.

Georgia officials said in a statement that there was a similar incident in Iowa, but no details have been released there.

The J&J jab, made by the US-firm's Belgium arm Janssen, had been earmarked by UK officials for young people because it is given as a single dose.

The vaccine has been approved in the EU and was due to be rolled out in the coming months. It is currently under review by the UK's medicines watchdog and the UK government has ordered 30 million doses.

The EMA has said that "at this stage, it is not yet clear whether there is a causal association" between either vaccines and the reported conditions.

J&J said that it was aware of the reports of blood clots and is working with regulators to assess the data and provide relevant information.

"At present, no clear, causal relationship has been established between these rare events and the Janssen Covid vaccine," the company said in a statement.

[The pair of articles from the NEJM above indicate that antibodies against platelet factor 4 induce the rare immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia that has been observed following administration of the AstraZeneca COVID vaccine. Other rare hematological events have now been reported following vaccination with the J&J COVID vaccine as well as the AstraZeneca vaccine, but it is obviously too early to say whether there is any causal relationship between them. For other coverage of these developments, see: https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/4/9/eu-regulators-reviewing-jjs-covid-vaccine-after-blood-clots, and https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/j-j-covid-19-vaccine-under-eu-review-over-blood-clots-1.538101.

Nevertheless, the benefits of vaccination clearly outweigh the potential risk of these extremely rare events. A vivid, graphical demonstration of the benefit-to-risk ratio for the AstraZeneca vaccine has been produced by the Winton Centre at the University of Cambridge, in which they compare the risk of ICU admission for COVID infection versus the risk of a blood clot possibly linked to the vaccine for different age groups and low-medium-high exposure risk.

[5] Japan: COVID variants, Osaka region

https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-japan-strain/japan-fears-covid-19-variants-are-behind-possible-fourth-wave-idUSL4N2LY0L6


Japanese health authorities are concerned that variants of the coronavirus are driving a nascent 4th wave in the pandemic with just 109 days remaining until the Tokyo Olympics.

The variants appear to be more infectious and may be resistant to vaccines, which are still not widely available in Japan. The situation is worst in Osaka, where infections hit fresh records last week, prompting the regional government to start targeted lockdown measures for one month from Monday [5 Apr 2021].

A mutant COVID-19 variant 1st discovered in Britain has taken hold in the Osaka region, spreading faster and filling up hospital beds with more serious cases than the original virus, according to Koji Wada, a government adviser on the pandemic.

"The 4th wave is going to be larger," said Wada, a professor at Tokyo's International University of Health and Welfare. "We need to start to discuss how we could utilize these targeted measures for the Tokyo area."

The British variant of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is 1.32 times more infectious than the original virus, a Japanese study has found. The study by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, which covered 803 cases of the British variant, compares with overseas studies that found the variant's infectivity is 43% to 90% higher than the original's.

The institute warned that in light of the British variant's strong infectivity, existing measures may not be enough to contain the pandemic.

The institute also found that the share of people under 18 among carriers of the British variant is larger than their share among carriers of the original virus.

Meanwhile, sample surveys conducted in Hyogo Prefecture suggested that COVID-19 variants are now responsible for more than 90% of new coronavirus cases in the prefecture, the Hyogo Prefectural Government said Thursday [8 Apr 2021].

According to the prefectural government, coronavirus variants were detected in 70, or 93.3%, of 75 people who tested positive for the coronavirus in the prefecture between 22-28 Mar 2021.

In a separate study by the city of Kobe, coronavirus variants were identified in 141, or 76.2%, of 185 new infection cases in the city in the same period, with the British variant found in 129 cases.

As over 40% of the British variant cases were not linked to earlier-known cases where variants were detected, "we have to admit a community spread of variants now," Kobe Mayor Kizo Hisamoto said.

The governor of Osaka Prefecture has warned that he may need to ask the central government to declare a state of emergency if current measures to quell the coronavirus outbreak are deemed insufficient.

The effect of stricter measures imposed earlier this month [April 2021] could start emerging in the week of 19 Apr 2021, and authorities will decide then whether an emergency declaration is needed, Gov. Hirofumi Yoshimura said in a television program late Saturday [10 Apr 2021]. If declared, measures stronger than those taken during a state of emergency earlier this year [2021] would be required, he said.

Osaka, Japan's 3rd-largest prefecture by population with 8.81 million people, is seeing a steep rise in the number of infections, exceeding that of the capital Tokyo. It registered a daily record of 918 new virus cases on Saturday [10 Apr 2021], compared with 570 in Tokyo, amid growing signs of a 4th wave of the pandemic driven by new variants.

The daily figures in Osaka have topped those of Tokyo for 12 consecutive days.

The central government on 5 Apr 2021 designated Osaka, Hyogo, and Miyagi prefectures as areas needing stricter measures to contain outbreaks. The government said on Friday [9 Apr 2021] that the quasi-state of emergency would be applied to Tokyo, Kyoto, and Okinawa prefectures from Monday [12 Apr 2021].

The National Institute of Infectious Diseases estimated that new variants were responsible for about 70% of new COVID-19 cases confirmed in Osaka and Hyogo prefectures earlier this month [April 2021], which likely pushed up a recent surge in infections. That compared with about 10% in Tokyo, Kanagawa, and Chiba prefectures, but the government is worried that there could be a spike in the greater Tokyo area as well.

[The sequential articles above, published just this past week of 5-11 Apr 2021, indicate that COVID variants are driving a surge of infections in Japan, particularly in the adjoining prefectures of Osaka and Hyogo. Japan-based ProMED Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka believes that the 1st publicly disclosed data of variants in Japan appear in an interview with Dr. Hiroshi Nishiura, professor of epidemiology at Kyoto University, that was published on 10 Apr 2021 by Yahoo News Japan from Buzz Feed Japan: https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/6aa599da8bd6be9d249ecbf0b5dc0ed0fa4253e4?page=1 (in Japanese). A table that accompanies this interview compares the number of cases of the "British strain" (presumably B.1.1.7) compared to the "conventional strain" (see https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/6aa599da8bd6be9d249ecbf0b5dc0ed0fa4253e4/images/002, in Japanese). According to Prof. Nishiura: "A state of emergency should be declared for Osaka/Hyogo. ... In Osaka, 80% of people are infected with British stocks at present. The number of infected people is increasing at a speed never seen before in Osaka. ... The number of critically ill patients who are in the (intensive care unit) or who are on artificial respiration is increasing and already occupy 90% of the critically ill beds, and if the number of patients increases at this pace, there will definitely be a flood of critically ill patients."

These comments underscore the Osaka governor's warning that he may seek a coronavirus state of emergency for the prefecture. - Mod.LXL]
