In the wake of [an outbreak of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever] in the
border areas of neighbouring Afghanistan, the Health Ministry has alerted
the health departments of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (province) and FATA about this
fatal virus [infection]. [The FATA (Federally Administered Tribal Areas)
are a group of small administrative units in the north west of Pakistan,
lying between the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the neighboring country of
Afghanistan. They comprise 7 tribal agencies and 6 smaller frontier
regions, with considerable autonomy from the rest of Pakistan. A map of the
FATA is available at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:FATA_%288%29.jpg>.

According to local sources, the deadly outbreak occurred in the Afghan
province of Helmand where Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus
infection had been confirmed in 7 people.

The Ministry had directed the provincial health authorities to remain
vigilant and collect data concerning Afghan refugees who were being treated
in various hospitals in the province, adding that the authorities had been
instructed also to send blood samples obtained from patients with suspected
CCHF to the federal capital for laboratory tests.

It has also been reported that all the public sector hospitals in the
province have been instructed to take precautionary measures to avoid the
spread of the virus. Security officials at the Torkham border [crossing]
have also been ordered to strictly monitor the movement of refugees at the
border.

CCHF is transferred to humans through tick bite or through direct contact
with blood or other infected tissues from livestock infected with the virus
[and also by nosocomial transmission in hospital. - Mod.CP]. Symptoms
include fever, aching muscles, dizziness, neck pain and stiffness,
backache, headache, sore eyes, and sensitivity to light. Other clinical
signs that may emerge include rapid heart rate, a dramatic drop in platelet
and white blood cell counts, bleeding from the upper bowel, blood in the
urine, nosebleeds, and bleeding gums. The severely ill may develop liver
and kidney failure after the 5th day of illness. In patients who recover,
improvement generally begins on the 9th or 10th day after the onset of illness.

[This report indicates that there have been 7 confirmed cases of CCHF virus
infection in the Afghan province of Helmand, which is adjacent to the
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (province) and FATA of Pakistan. An alert is in force,
and there may be CCHF cases among refugees from Helmand in hospitals in
Pakistan. It is unclear whether there have been as yet any confirmed cases
in Pakistan. Further information from the region would be welcomed.
