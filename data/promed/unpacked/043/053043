A comment
---------
The undiagnosed disease reported in the ProMED-mail post entitled
"Undiagnosed disease - Nepal: (SI) RFI 20090810.2842", sounds remarkably
like the undiagnosed condition reported via ProMED-mail and recorded in
several remote villages in Nepal back in about March or early April 2009
(can't quite recall the dates or references of the initial and at least one
follow-up post).

From memory it reportedly killed at least 16 (most from one village) and
had spread to at least 2 other nearby villages. I seem to recall that it
occurred there about 3 weeks before poultry started dying from H5N1 in
Tibet and wild birds started dying in Quinghai lakes and then in Mongolia.
At that time I don't think clinical reports included severe headaches, but
did include fever, SARI [symptoms associated with respiratory illness], and
haemorrhagic expectoration.

Could possibly have been a very aggressive influenza originally, but with
the strong headache added, now sounds a bit more like a haemorrhagic fever
of some type (as pointed out by the Moderator). A spot to watch, I believe.

[David Thomson's comments are welcomed and ProMED-mail awaits with interest
the outcome of the investigation now under way in Sindhuli District. The
ProMED-mail posts cited by David Thomson are those listed below, I believe.
There is certainly some similarity in the descriptions of the disease, but
the outbreaks occurred in different districts of Nepal. - Mod.CP]
