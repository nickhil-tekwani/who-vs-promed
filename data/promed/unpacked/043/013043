Australian salmon farmer Petuna has culled around 100 000 fish in its Macquarie Harbour [West Coast region of Tasmania] farms in response to an outbreak of pilchard orthomyxovirus (POMV).

POMV has been a reoccurring issue for Tasmania's salmon industry and has led to hundreds of thousands of fish deaths in recent years.

The cull was undertaken to prevent the spread of POMV, and was only detected in the company's juvenile stock, the firm said.

This comes after Petuna recorded a slight increase in fish mortality in November 2017, however, POMV hadn't been detected in the company's operations at that time.

Petuna's general manager of marine, Richard Miller, said all industry operators humanely culled infected fish to protect the rest of the farm if necessary.

"The Tasmanian aquaculture industry is taking the lead in initiating and funding research into understanding POMV, including vaccine development," he said.

[An orthomyxovirus of great economic impact for the salmon industry is the causal agent of infectious salmon anemia, a disease of Atlantic salmons (_Salmo salar_).

The pilchard orthomyxovirus is a newly recognized pathogen that was reported in Tasmania for the 1st time in 2012, during an outbreak in farmed salmon. - Mod.PMB
