Uganda: Marburg outbreak in Uganda contained
-------------------------------------------
Uganda has contained an outbreak of Marburg disease among gold
miners, but contacts of the 2 known cases must now make sure they
don't spread the deadly virus through sex, the World Health
Organisation said on Fri 17 Aug 2007. WHO expert Pierre Formenty said
investigators had collected hundreds of bats from the mine, which
they suspect may be a possible reservoir of the disease.
A miner died on 14 Jul 2007 and another was confirmed this week
[13-17 Aug 2007] as having survived the rare viral haemorrhagic
disease, spread through blood or other body fluids including semen.
Closely related to Ebolavirus, it kills most of its victims.
"This outbreak is contained. But we need to follow up the survivors
and (contacts) need to have safe sex in the next 3 months at least,"
Formenty told reporters by telephone. "Survivors could eject virus in
semen." He was speaking from a laboratory near Kitaka mine in the
western Kamwenge district, some 250 km (155 miles) from the capital
Kampala.
A team of 8 international experts has gathered there to research how
the virus is transmitted to humans and to try to pin down its elusive
"natural reservoir." Active surveillance of the miners and nearby
population would continue to the end of August [2007], Formenty said.
"We should stay vigilant, other outbreaks will come," he added,
noting that there had been multiple outbreaks of both Marburg and
Ebola in Africa over the past decade.
A major outbreak of Marburg occurred among gold miners in the
Democratic Republic of Congo between 1998 and 2000, causing 128
deaths among 154 cases. An outbreak in Angola in 2004-2005 killed 150
people among 163 cases, according to the WHO. There is no vaccine or
specific treatment for the disease, which causes a severe headache
and fever followed by rapid debilitation. Death can follow within 8
to 9 days.
An outbreak is contained when 2 incubation periods, or 21 days, have
passed without any contacts developing symptoms. Experts from the
WHO, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and South
Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases have been
examining some 300 fruit- and insect-eating bats trapped when leaving
the mine. But Robert Swanepoel, a South African expert who has also
worked on previous outbreaks in Congo and Angola, said: "Finding the
virus doesn't prove that a species is in fact the key to the riddle
of where the virus remains or is perpetuated. The tragedy of this
disease ... is an outbreak goes by very quickly. You are looking for
something that is no longer there."

[So far the investigation has shed little light on the source of the
outbreak virus. The WHO Weekly Epidemiological Record of Fri 17 Aug
2007
(<http://www.who.int/wer/2007/wer8233/en/index.html>) states that
interviews conducted with the mine authorities have identified one
additional suspected case and 2 individuals who were taken ill in
mid-June 2007 and have since recovered. These individuals are being
investigated as a matter of priority. All the miners under
investigation for Marburg hemorrhagic fever had been at the mine for
approximately 8 months with no movements outside the mining area
during that time. To date, there have been no reported cases among
health care workers.
The particular strain of Marburgvirus associated with this outbreak
appears to be not easily transmissible. - Mod.CP]
