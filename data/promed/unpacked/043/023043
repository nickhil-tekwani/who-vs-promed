Avian cholera hits Upper Klamath Lake duck population
-----------------------------------------------
Dozens of ducks were found dead this past week in Upper Klamath Lake
after an outbreak of avian cholera, and more dead birds are expected
over the next few weeks as spring migration season tapers off,
authorities said.
Technicians at the National Wildlife Health Center in Madison,
Wisconsin confirmed the dead ducks contained the cholera bacteria,
which is highly contagious among waterfowl but not dangerous to
people or pets, according to state and federal biologists.
The results match similar findings for an outbreak in lower Klamath
Basin marshes, where an estimated 500 birds died from cholera in
February and March 2006, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
The cholera sprouted toward the end of this year's [2006] spring
migration through the Klamath Basin, which served as a major staging
ground for an estimated 1.5 million migratory birds this year, said
Dave Mauser, wildlife biologist with the Klamath Basin National
Wildlife Refuge Complex, based in Tulelake, California.
"As outbreaks go here in the Klamath Basin, it's not that huge,"
Mauser said. "Back in the '70s, we'd lose tens of thousands of birds.
It would hit so hard and so fast that birds would literally fall out
of the sky."
Though the die-off has remained light, the outbreak has drawn more
attention because of the expectation that the avian influenza strain
known as the H5N1 virus is expected to surface among some Pacific
Flyway waterfowl later this year [2006].
Avian cholera, also known as fowl cholera, is one of the most common
diseases among wild North American waterfowl and is tracked monthly
by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
The disease is the result of infection with the bacteria, which can
kill within 6 to 12 hours after infection, according to the USGS.
Live bacteria released into the environment by dead and dying birds
can subsequently infect healthy birds. As a result, avian cholera can
spread quickly through a wetland and kill hundreds to thousands of
birds in a single outbreak.

[Avian cholera is caused by _Pasteurella multocida_. There are
several types or strains. The most common type affecting wild birds
is Type 1. In the wild, it affects primarily ducks, coots, geese,
gulls and crows. The causative agent is contained in feces and other
body secretions. Ingestion of food or water contaminated with any
infected body secretions will spread the disease. Transmission by
aerosol may occur, and the bacteria can survive up to 4 months in the soil.
Death is usually rapid, even to the point of causing infected birds
to fall out of the sky. Lethargy and convulsions may occur in sick
birds that do not die acutely.
Generally, clean up of carcasses will help prevent contamination of
the environment. - Mod.TG]
