CHIKUNGUNYA (07): NEW CALEDONIA, COMMENT

With such a dire threat from the chikungunya outbreak in New
Caledonia, local recommendations for vector control measures, prompt
diagnosis of suspected cases, and wide use of insect repellents by
febrile patients and relatives are essential to prevent an epidemic
spread of this disease.

We particularly stress the relevant use of impregnated bed nets by
febrile patients suspected of acute chikungunya virus infection.
Indeed, viremia rises to a high level in this disease (up to 10 to the
9th-10th to the 12th RNA copies/mL) and usually lasts for 7 days. The
human reservoir of the virus is very important and increases
exponentially during an outbreak.

Thus, individual use of repellents is essential but difficult to
correctly apply a few times a day for one week. Therefore, the
altruistic use of bed nets is an available complement, considering
that most infected people lie in bed or stay at home during the 1st
week [of their disease].

Any health authority confronted with either a threat or a current
outbreak of chikungunya virus infection (or any other mosquitoborne
infection) should consider this efficient but frequently ignored
public health measure.

[ProMED-mail thanks Drs Simon and Javelle for their interesting
comments. As they point out, the only effective responses to reduce
transmission are elimination of vector mosquito breeding sites and
avoidance of mosquito bites. Keeping bed nets over viremic patients
can be an important contribution for halting household transmission of
chikungunya virus. No vaccine for chikungunya virus is available
commercially.
