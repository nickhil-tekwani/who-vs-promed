The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) verified with the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) today [9 Jan 2014] a human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) affecting a woman aged 51 in Zhejiang. The case was confirmed yesterday [8 Jan 2014] and the patient is receiving medical treatment in a hospital in Hangzhou and is in serious condition.

To date, a total of 152 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been confirmed on [Mainland China]. They are in Zhejiang (53 cases), Shanghai (34 cases), Jiangsu (29 cases), Guangdong (10 cases), Jiangxi (6 cases), Fujian (5 cases), Anhui (4 cases), Henan (4 cases), Beijing (2 cases), Hunan (2 cases), Shandong (2 cases), and Hebei (one case). The CHP will follow up with the Mainland health authorities for more case details.

"Locally, enhanced disease surveillance, port health measures, and health education against avian influenza are ongoing. We will remain vigilant and maintain liaison with the World Health Organization (WHO) and relevant health authorities. Local surveillance activities will be modified upon the WHO's recommendations," a spokesman for the DH said. "All boarder control points have implemented disease prevention and control measures. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks of inbound travellers. Random temperature checks by handheld devices will also be arranged. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up investigation," the spokesman added.

Regarding health education for travellers, distribution of pamphlets, display of posters in departure and arrival halls, in-flight public announcements, environmental health inspection, and provision of regular updates to the travel industry via meetings and correspondence are all proceeding. "Travellers, especially those returning from avian influenza-affected areas and provinces with fever or respiratory symptoms, should immediately wear masks, seek medical attention, and reveal their travel history to doctors. Healthcare professionals should pay special attention to patients who might have had contact with poultry, birds, or their droppings in affected areas and provinces," the spokesman advised.

Members of the public should remain vigilant and take heed of the preventive advice against avian influenza below:
- Do not visit live poultry markets. Avoid contact with poultry, birds and their droppings. If contact has been made, thoroughly wash hands with soap;
- poultry and eggs should be thoroughly cooked before eating;
- wash hands frequently with soap, especially before touching the mouth, nose, or eyes, handling food, or eating; after going to the toilet or touching public installations or equipment (including escalator handrails, elevator control panels, and door knobs); or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing;
- cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing, hold the spit with a tissue and put it into a covered dustbin;
- avoid crowded places and contact with fever patients; and
- wear masks when respiratory symptoms develop or when taking care of fever patients.

The public may visit the CHP's avian influenza page (http://www.chp.gov.hk/en/view_content/24244.html) and website (http://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/global_statistics_avian_influenza_e.pdf) for more information on avian influenza-affected areas and provinces.

[3] Shanghai: H7N9, market risk

To prevent a recurrence of avian influenza, Shanghai will suspend live poultry trading from [31 Jan 2014], the 1st day of the Chinese New Year, to [30 Apr 2014], city media reported. The suspension will be enforced annually during this period for the next 5 years, depending on the assessments of the risk and the seasonal prevalence of avian influenza, according to a statement issued by the Shanghai Municipal Agricultural Commission and the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Commerce.

In April last year [2013], all of Shanghai's live poultry markets were shut down after 43 people died of the H7N9 avian influenza in China. The ban was lifted in June and about 110 poultry markets reopened.
