Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza In Romania Follow-up report No. 3
See also: 21 Oct 2005, 14 Oct 2005, 14 Oct 2005
Information received on 19 and 20 Oct 2005 from
Dr Gabriel Predoi, Director General, National
Sanitary Veterinary and Food Safety Authority, Bucharest:
End of previous report period: 14 Oct 2005 (see
Disease Information, 18 [42], 355, dated 21 Oct 2005).
End of this report period: 20 Oct 2005.
Precise identification of agent: highly
pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 (see details below).
Date of first confirmation of the event: 7 Oct 2005.
Date of start of the event: 4 Oct 2005.
Diagnosis (updated information):
Laboratories where diagnostic tests were
performed: Institute for Diagnostics and Animal
Health (National Reference Laboratory)
Outbreak: village of Ceamurlia-de-Jos
Birds examined: 3 ducks and 2 laying hens
Diagnostic tests used: - ELISA(1); - agar gel immunodiffusion
Date: 7 Oct. 2005
Results: positive for ducks
Laboratories where diagnostic tests were
performed: Institute for Diagnostics and Animal
Health (National Reference Laboratory)
Outbreak: villages of Maliuc and Vulturu
Birds examined: 1 swan and 1 hen
Diagnostic tests used: inoculation of SPF(1) embryonated chicken eggs
Date: 10 Oct 2005
Results: positive (virus type H5) for both birds
Laboratories where diagnostic tests were
performed: VLA Weybridge (United Kingdom) (OIE Reference Laboratory)
Outbreak: village of Ceamurlia-de-Jos
Birds examined: 1 allantoic fluid sample from
chicken and 1 allantoic fluid sample from duck
Diagnostic tests used: virological examination
Date: 16 Oct. 2005
Results: influenza A virus subtype H5N1(a)
Laboratories where diagnostic tests were
performed:VLA Weybridge (United Kingdom) (OIE Reference Laboratory)
Outbreak: villages of Maliuc and Vulturu
Birds examined:
Sample 1: allantoic fluid from a swan (ex tracheal swab).
Sample 2: allantoic fluid from a chicken (ex tracheal swab).
Diagnostic tests used: virological examination
Date: 16 Oct 2005
Results: influenza A virus subtype H5N1(b)
(a) The haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase
(NA) genes of the influenza A virus subtype H5N1
isolated from the duck are 100 percent identical
to those of the virus from the chicken. Molecular
phylogeny indicates that the NA gene of both
viruses is identical to that of the H5N1 highly
pathogenic avian influenza virus strain
A/turkey/Turkey/1/05 and therefore, as for the HA
gene, is closely related to viruses detected recently in Central Asia.
(b) The haemagglutinating agents received (both
samples 1 and 2) have been confirmed as influenza
A subtype H5N1. Both viruses contain multiple
basic amino acids at the cleavage site
(PQGERRRKKRGLF) of the haemagglutinin gene and
therefore contain a sequence consistent with
highly pathogenic avian influenza. Molecular
phylogeny indicates that the HA gene of samples 1
and 2 is most similar to that of
A/grebe/Novosibirsk/05 (99.2 percent identity)
and identity between samples 1 and 2 is 99.8
percent. The results indicate a direct
relationship with viruses detected elsewhere in
Romania, Turkey and Central Asia.
Other details/comments:
- In the Maliuc and Vulturu outbreaks,
stamping-out activities have been completed; a
total of 3562 domestic poultry were killed and their carcasses destroyed.
- The outbreak in Ceamurlia-de-Jos was
eradicated. A total of 18 626 domestic poultry
were killed and their carcasses incinerated, and
disinfection was carried out. Measures have been
taken to protect the human population.
Final report: no.
(1) ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay

[These results, although not unexpected, do
appear to substantiate that the same virus is
present not only in Turkey and Romania but in the
earlier outbreak in Central Asia. The strain
isolated from Novosibirsk was in July and the
location -- northeast of Kazakhstan -- can be as
