A disease-spreading sandfly has been plaguing the central and northern West Bank as well as the Lower Galilee in recent months, prompting calls for increased government spending to address the threat. Sandflies found in Israel and the surrounding areas often carry a parasite called leishmania, which they contract from the rock hyrax, a small desert mammal native to the Middle East and Africa. People bitten by an infected sandfly develop leishmaniasis, an illness characterized by skin ulcers and open sores at the bite site that can take up to 18 months to fully heal.

Children are particularity vulnerable to leishmaniasis, as sandflies generally tend to fly close to the ground. "It just keeps spreading, and so I think that we are in a national emergency," Professor Eli Schwartz, director of the Center for Geographic Medicine at Tel Hashomer, told Hadashot ["News", Israel TV]. "When you look at the outbreak distribution on a map, it covers about 50 per cent of Israel." Schwartz said some communities in northern and central Israel had a 30 per cent infection rate, and some area army bases were at 50 per cent.

In 2016, dozens of cases of leishmaniasis were reported in the northern West Bank, mostly in the settlement of Zufim. Locals at the time said the construction of the security barrier over the past decade led to a decrease in hyrax habitats, a charge the Defense Ministry firmly denied.

In Israel, the rock hyrax is considered an endangered species, and killing the animal, even for population control, is illegal. Efforts by the Israel Nature and Parks Authority to distance the rock hyrax from residential areas in recent years have only pushed the animals in the direction of other settlements in the area. In Nili, in the central West Bank [see map at https://tinyurl.com/y88j8fxp], an electric fence was recently built to keep the hyrax away, but local residents say the measure has not helped, and packs of hyrax are seen roaming the settlement.

The mayor of the nearby city of Modiin [seen in the above map, south of Nili] told Hadashot that the money allocated for combating leishmaniasis was insufficient. Haim Bibas said he has requested an urgent meeting with deputy health minister Yaakov Litzman and local leaders to discuss the issue. "The budgets allocated for this over the last 4 years are just not enough," he said. "We are witnessing a leishmaniasis epidemic."

In response to the report, several government agencies pledged to divert additional funds to help fight the spread of the disease, but blamed the lack of a coordinated response on one another. The Environmental Protection Ministry said it was taking the growing number of cases in Israel "very seriously", but claimed it was not allocated money in its 2019 budget for leishmaniasis treatment and prevention. The Finance Ministry denied that claim, and said it had transferred ILS 30 million [about USD 8.3 million] to fight leishmaniasis, but the agency misused the funds. "To this day, despite the time that's passed, the Environmental Protection Ministry has not managed to spend the money to deal with the problem," the treasury said, adding that the ministry had "chosen to use it for other issues." The Health Ministry also denied that leishmaniasis was reaching epidemic levels, and said data showed a decrease in the number of cases in recent years. The ministry said it was conducting epidemiological studies to monitor the spread of leishmaniasis and research better treatment options.

Rock hyrax (_Procavia capensis_) is one of the 4 living species of the order Hyracoidea. The closest living relatives to hyraxes are the modern-day elephants and sirenians. The rock hyrax is found across Africa and the Middle East, in habitats with rock crevices in which to escape from predators. For a picture, go to https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Hyrax_Family.jpg.

In Ethiopia, Israel, and Jordan, the rock hyrax has been shown to be a reservoir of the leishmaniasis parasite. Three species of _Leishmania_ are endemic in Israel. _Leishmania major_ and _L. tropica_ cause cutaneous leishmaniasis, and _L. infantum_ causes visceral leishmaniasis. Experimental evidence showed that hyraxes are competent reservoirs of _L. tropica_. A previous study in northern Israel indicated that 10 per cent of the hyraxes sampled in an area with cutaneous leishmaniasis were positive for _L. tropica_. There are no data supporting the statement by the inhabitants in Zufim that the security barrier has caused an increase in the habitat of the rock hyrax. - Mods.ARN/EP
