El Mahmoudeya Central Hospital, located in Egypt's Beheira Governorate, received on Thu 1 Oct 2020 134 people experiencing severe symptoms of food poisoning after eating at a wedding in the village of Ezbet al-Far. A number of families, including dozens of children, promptly reported to the hospital for treatment. All cases were successfully treated, according to the hospital's Director, Ashraf al-Qalfat.

Among the patients that the hospital received, many presented with no symptoms but were worried that they had contracted the illness, said Qalfat. All but 5 patients have been discharged from the hospital, and those who remain are in stable condition.

_Salmonella_ and _E. coli_ are 2 of the many commonly found food-related illnesses in Egypt. Washing food with untreated water, cross-contamination between raw and uncooked foods, and poor hand hygiene all contribute to a greater risk of spreading foodborne illness.

[No information is provided regarding the symptoms of those affected and how many people were at the event.

It can be quite helpful in suspecting an etiology to know the incubation period, what food is suspected, whether fever was present, and what symptoms were prominent (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea). As can be seen by the see also list below, not all of these clusters are due to infection.

Beheira governorate is a coastal governorate in Egypt, located in the northern part of the country in the Nile Delta. - Mod.LL
