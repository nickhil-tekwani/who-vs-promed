CDC is collaborating with public health officials in several states,
the Indian Health Service, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
to investigate an ongoing multistate outbreak of human _Salmonella
[enterica_] serotype Saintpaul infections. An epidemiologic
investigation conducted by the New Mexico and Texas Departments of
Health and the Indian Health Service using interviews comparing foods
eaten by ill and well persons has identified consumption of raw
tomatoes as the likely source of the illnesses in New Mexico and
Texas. The specific type and source of tomatoes are under
investigation; however, preliminary data suggest that large tomatoes,
including Roma and red round are the source.

Since late April 2008, 40 persons infected with _S._ Saintpaul with
the same genetic fingerprint have been identified in Texas (21
persons) and New Mexico (19 persons). The New Mexico Department of
Health is investigating 17 additional _S._ Saintpaul illnesses. These
were identified because clinical laboratories in all states send
_Salmonella_ strains from ill persons to their State public health
laboratory for characterization. Among the 38 persons who have been
interviewed, illnesses began between 23 Apr 2008 and 27 May 2008.
Patients range in age from 3 to 82 years; 48 percent are female. At
least 17 persons were hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

In addition, approximately 30 persons with _S._ Saintpaul infection
have been reported since late April [2008] in residents of Arizona,
Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, and Utah. Investigations
are underway to determine if consumption of raw tomatoes is also
associated with illness in these states.

Advice to consumers
-------------------
In New Mexico and Texas, until the source of the implicated tomatoes
is determined, persons with increased risk of severe infection,
including infants, elderly persons, and those with impaired immune
systems, should not eat raw Roma or red round tomatoes other than
those sold attached to the vine or grown at home, and persons who
want to reduce their risk of _Salmonella_ infection can avoid
consuming raw Roma or red round tomatoes other than those sold
attached to the vine or grown at home.

Avoid purchasing bruised or damaged tomatoes and discard any that
appear spoiled.

Thoroughly wash all tomatoes under running water.

Refrigerate within 2 hours or discard cut, peeled, or cooked tomatoes.

Keep tomatoes that will be consumed raw separate from raw meats, raw
seafood, and raw produce items.

Wash cutting boards, dishes, utensils, and counter tops with hot
water and soap when switching between types of food products.
