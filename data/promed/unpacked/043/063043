An outbreak of foot and mouth disease [FMD] in south Armenia has been
reported by the news agency Novosti-Armenia on Tuesday [29 May 2007].
More than 100 bovines were reportedly found affected on 27 May 2007,
of which 30 were in the town of Sisian, 60 in the village Ahlatyan,
10 in the village Shamb and 12 in the village Uyts. The State
Veterinary Inspectorate of the Ministry of Agriculture of Armenia has
already applied vaccination and indicated that the situation is under control.

[During July/August 2006, media reports from the Shirak (northwest)
region of Armenia describing a disease in bovines characterized
mainly by stomatitis and suspected to be foot and mouth disease (FMD)
have been repeatedly denied. No other etiologies have been
established, and the event remained unsolved or, at least,
un-clarified internationally. The current report is related to
southeast Armenia (Siunik); Sisian can be seen on the map at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/armenia_pol_2002.jpg>.
According to the last annual report of Armenia to the OIE, covering
2005, the disease was absent during that year. Previous reports
indicated that the last FMD outbreak in Armenia was diagnosed and
notified in 2000.
Accurate, firsthand information on the current FMD situation in
Armenia, including laboratory results on the virus type and strain,
is soon anticipated. - Mod.AS]
