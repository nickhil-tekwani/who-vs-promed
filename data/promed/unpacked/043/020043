The following summary of test results were released on 7 Sep 2000.
(1) Human testing: A 43-year old Jersey City man has tested positive for
the presence of West Nile virus (WNV). Serum and spinal fluid samples
tested positive in the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services
laboratories, and the result was verified 1 Sep 2000, by the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Additional confirmatory
test results from the CDC will be available in the next few weeks. This is
the first human case of WNV in New Jersey. The man was admitted to
Meadowlands Hospital Medical Center in Secaucus in early Aug 2000 with
symptoms consistent with WNV infection - a fever greater than 100 degrees,
muscle weakness, headache and lethargy. He has since been discharged from
the hospital and is home recovering. In total, blood and/or spinal fluid
samples from 22 residents have been or are in the process of being tested
for the presence of WNV. To date, 1 test was positive, 10 were negative and
11 are pending. These individuals either had symptoms or signs that met the
established WNV testing criteria or exhibited most of the symptoms and are
from counties where dead crows and/or mosquitoes with the virus have been
discovered.
(2) Crow, Hawk & Falcon Testing: To date, 586 birds (585 crows and a
cockatiel) found in 14 counties have tested positive for the presence of
WNV. Positive birds have been found in Bergen (143), Burlington (1), Cape
May (1), Essex (70), Gloucester (1), Hudson (51), Hunterdon (1), Mercer
(1), Middlesex (125), Monmouth (79), Morris (8), Passaic (43), Somerset (3)
and Union (59) Counties. The tests were conducted at the Department of
Health and Senior Services' lab in Trenton. A total of 1 211 crows have
been accepted for testing this year.
(3)Mosquito & House Sparrow Testing: 7 mosquito pools collected in Bergen
(5) and Middlesex (2) Counties have tested positive for the presence of
WNV. More than 1 400 mosquito pools from all 21 counties have been
collected by the Rutgers Mosquito Research and Control Unit and tested by
the Department of Health and Senior Services and/or the CDC. In addition to
mosquitoes, the CDC also analyzed blood samples taken from 541 house
sparrows collected in Bergen, Passaic and Sussex County in late July. No
sparrows with WNV were discovered in New Jersey.
(4) Sentinel Chicken Testing: Blood samples taken weekly from sentinel
chicken flocks placed in all 21 counties and tested by the New Jersey
Department of Agriculture have all tested negative for the presence of WNV
to date.
(5) Horse Testing: A Cape May County horse, euthanized 30 Aug 2000 after
becoming ill 3 days earlier, has tested positive for the presence of WNV.
The test was conducted in the New Jersey Department of Agriculture's animal
health laboratory in Trenton and was confirmed by the National Veterinary
Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa. No other horse has tested positive.

Subject: West Nile virus, bats - Request for information

From the standpoint of a veterinary pathologist, it would be interesting
to know whether there were any histologic lesions visible in these bats,
and if so what they were.
