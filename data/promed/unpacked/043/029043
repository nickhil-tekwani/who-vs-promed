England (Somerset): Norwalk-like Virus Outbreaks Affect 2 Hospitals
---------------------------------------------------------------------
More than 80 people are now affected by the outbreak of a highly
contagious virus at 2 Somerset hospitals. About 60 patients and 20
staff at Yeovil District Hospital are showing symptoms of the
airborne Norwalk-like virus, which causes sickness and diarrhea.
Martin Carter from the Dorset and Somerset Health Authority said the
virus has also spread to Verrington Community Hospital in Wincanton,
where 7 patients and 2 staff are thought to have been infected.
Mr Cater said the outbreak began last week and had spread to
Verrington through 2 patients who were transferred there from Yeovil.
"They were not showing signs of the virus when they were discharged
from Yeovil but when they arrived at the community hospital they
developed the symptoms," he said. The hospital in Yeovil is closed to
non-emergency patients but is still treating emergency admissions.
"We are satisfied that everything it is possible to do to prevent the
spread is being done," said Mr Carter.

Northern Ireland: Norwalk-like Virus Outbreaks Affect 4 Hospitals
--------------------------------------------------------------------
More then 70 patients and 11 staff in 4 Northern Ireland hospitals
are now believed to be affected by a severe stomach virus. The small
round structured virus [now more usually designated Norwalk-like
virus - Mod.CP] swept through hospitals in Northern Ireland earlier
this year. The symptoms can last for several days. The stomach virus
has recently spread to patients in Ballymena, County Antrim.
The Braid Valley hospital said 24 of its patients and 4 staff were
affected. At the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald, on the outskirts of
east Belfast, 38 patients are under observation on 2 wards, and 7
staff there are sick. The Royal Group of Hospitals in west Belfast
said 2 of its patients have been infected. At the City Hospital in
south Belfast, 9 patients have the virus and 4 beds have been closed.
Doctors said the virus was "rampant" in the community and that it was
impossible to stop it spreading into hospitals.

[Members of the virus genus "Norwalk-like viruses" (recently
redesignated as the genus _Norovirus_ by the International Committee
on Taxonomy of Viruses) often have a less well defined surface
structure than other members of the family _Caliciviridae_ when
observed by negative stain electron microscopy. Consequently, these
viruses, which are associated with epidemic gastroenteritis in humans
(sometimes described as "winter vomiting disease"), were given the
name "small round structured viruses". - Mod.CP]
