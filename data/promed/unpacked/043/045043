PARVOVIRUS, CANINE - AUSTRALIA (SYDNEY) (02)

In Australia we are taught that maternal antibody to parvovirus from
vaccinated mothers persists up to 16 weeks. Our vaccination regimen
recommendation in practice is based on a minimum of triple antigen (C3 or
DHP -- depending upon your terminology). On the basis of the range of
colostral protection from bitches of variable vaccination status, vaccine
manufacturers arrived at the commercial rationale of vaccination at 6-8,
12-14, and 16-18 weeks for primary cover.
Failure to advise owners about the 3rd primary booster here is considered
negligent (as pups from recently vaccinated bitches would be more likely to
be completely susceptible to parvovirus).
