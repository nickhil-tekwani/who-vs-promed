Anthrax in bison closes Wood Buffalo campgrounds
----------------------------------------------------------
The 2 campgrounds at Wood Buffalo National Park in the Northwest
Territories are closed for the next 2 days [27-28 Jul 2007], while
park officials burn bison carcasses infected with anthrax. A total of
6 infected bison were found in the park, including 2 on Tuesday [24
Jul 2007]. One of the animals was found near the park's Kettle Point
campground, which led staff to ask a group of campers to leave.
It's still safe for visitors to come to the park, and to the
neighbouring community of Fort Smith. Park spokesman Mike Keizer told
CBC News that the campgrounds were closed as a safety precaution.
"When there is a carcass in close proximity we're just moving them
out until we dispose of the carcass through burning and spraying the
area. Once that is done the camp will be reopened," Keizer said.
"We're not keeping them out any longer than we have to, but while
we're dealing with the actual incineration we just don't want people
nearby while you've got dry trees and forest."
Keizer warned people to stay away from any dead bison they see in the
park. Infected bison cannot pass the disease on to other bison, but
humans can be at risk if they come in contact with infected animals
or carcasses.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett
[Anthrax has been officially known to occur in the wood bison in the
Wood Bison National Park since 1963. The 1st recorded case was in
1956 when there was a case of cutaneous anthrax in a young man in
Fort Smith as a result of skinning a dead bison. It probably 1st
occurred there in the 1930s. Whether earlier is a matter of conjecture.
A few years ago in a financial crunch the park did not burn carcasses
and as a result there was a subsequent significant surge in cases in
the park and in adjoining areas. There are now proactive surveillance
flights each week during the summer and a structured response process
for rapidly and efficiently burning carcasses when found. The burn
crews can burn 3 carcasses each day ... the reader must realise that
these are not cute plains bison but monsters of 2500 pounds and it
takes 1000 pounds of coal laid between green tree trunks; the carcass
is hand winched over on to this; and then covered by cut dry timber
and lit using a couple of buckets of diesel fuel. Expert and skilled
work. -Mod.MHJ
