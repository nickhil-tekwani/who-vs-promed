Transplanted pig organs could carry deadly virus
Pig organ transplants, while offering hope of an end to a worldwide organ
shortage, carry the risk of infecting humans with new, possibly deadly
viruses, Britain's Lancet medical journal said on Friday. Pigs are reckoned
to be the most practical species to use for transplants into humans, being
the right size, easy to raise and until recently thought to be fairly free
of pathogens that could threaten transplant recipients. But British
scientists last year found that a virus -- called porcine endogenous
retrovirus (PERV) -- whose genes are found scattered throughout a pig's
genetic make-up is shed by pig kidney cells, and, in cell culture, can
infect human cells.
"The discovery sparked fears that if pig organs were used for
transplantation they could introduce new, possibly deadly disease-causing
viruses into the human population," the weekly journal said. According to
the Lancet, a German research group has now found that the PERV virus is
produced by cells from pig aortas, livers, lungs and skin as well as from
the kidneys. These are all tissues likely to be used for transplants.
However a U.S./Swedish research group, also quoted in the magazine,
reported that they had found no evidence of PERV infection in blood samples
from 10 Swedish diabetes patients who had received transplants of
insulin-producing cells from pigs.
Similarly, a third research group, said they could find no evidence of PERV
infection in two kidney-failure patients who had their blood passed through
pig kidneys. Jonathan Stoye, an expert from London's National Institute for
Medical Research, said that only with limited clinical trials, which are
awaiting regulatory approval, would it be possible to test "long-term
xenograft survival and function."
