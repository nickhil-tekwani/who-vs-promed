Contagious equine metritis, Denmark
-----------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 19 Dec 2019 from Dr. Hanne Larsen, Chief Veterinary Officer, Danish Veterinary and Food Administration, Ministry of Environment and Food, Glostrup, Denmark

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 16 Dec 2019
Date of confirmation of the event: 18 Dec 2019
Reason for notification: Recurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 31 Oct 2019
Manifestation of disease: Subclinical infection
Causal agent: _Taylorella equigenitalis_
Nature of diagnosis: Laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks: Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Vodskov, Aalborg, West [North Jutland]
Date of start of the outbreak: 16 Dec 2019
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Equidae / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: Stallion tested prior to be used for breeding, no clinical signs observed. Samples were collected on [16 Dec 2019], and _Taylorella equigenitalis_ was detected on [18 Dec 2019]. Official restrictions were imposed on the stallion on [18 Dec 2019]. The stallion was subsequently subject to antimicrobial treatment.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Equidae / 100 / 0 / 0 / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: Official restrictions have been imposed on the stallion. The official restrictions include antimicrobial treatment. The stallion must subsequently be tested negative for _T. equigenitalis_.

Control measures
Measures applied: Traceability, quarantine, vaccination permitted (if vaccine exists), treatment of affected animals (antimicrobial treatment)
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Statens Serum Institut (national laboratory) / Equidae / Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 18 Dec 2019 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

"Contagious equine metritis was 1st described in the United Kingdom (UK) in 1977, after which it was diagnosed in a number of countries worldwide. It 1st presented as disease outbreaks characterized by a mucopurulent vaginal discharge originating from inflammation of the endometrium and cervix, resulting in temporary infertility. Mares may experience more than one episode of the disease in a short period. Most mares recover uneventfully, but some may become carriers of the causal organism, _Taylorella equigenitalis_, for many months. Infection does not always adversely affect conception, and abortion due to _T. equigenitalis_ is a very rare occurrence. Many primary cases are subclinical, and a frequent indicator of infection is the mare returning in oestrus prematurely after being bred to a putative carrier stallion. Infection in a stallion is asymptomatic.

"The carrier state plays an important role in the dissemination of the bacterium. The urogenital membranes of the stallion become contaminated at coitus or by contact with fomites typically employed in semen collection. The carrier state may persist for many months or years. Most carrier mares are clitoral carriers, and poor hygienic measures when breeding may also spread the organism. Prior infection or vaccination is not fully protective, as the serum antibody only persists for a few weeks after infection, so control of infection has relied solely on prevention of transmission.

"The organism can be eliminated by treatment with antibiotics combined with antiseptic washing of the affected sites. _Taylorella equigenitalis_ is not known to infect humans, and it should be handled in the laboratory with appropriate biosafety and containment procedures as determined by biorisk analysis".
