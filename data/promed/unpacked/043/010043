LEGIONELLOSIS - CANADA (08): (QUEBEC), FATAL, COOLING TOWER

Public health authorities say they have identified the source of Quebec City's outbreak of Legionnaires' disease: an office building in the provincial capital. They say samples taken from a cooling tower in a building on St-Joseph Street in Quebec City's lower-town area match the genetic fingerprint of the strain of _Legionella_ bacteria found in patients who've been treated.

Public health officials told a news conference today [19 Sep 2012] that the tower is safe again and there's no reason for people to modify work or leisure activities. They say their conclusion is based on preliminary information released by the laboratory conducting the tests.

From the start, the source of the outbreak was suspected to have been an office cooling tower. Authorities scrambled to ensure all the towers were cleaned in the affected areas while at the same time seeking to pinpoint the actual origin.

Since the outbreak began in July 2012, 180 cases have been reported; 13 people have died.

The deadly bacteria grow in the stagnant water of cooling systems and spread in little droplets through air conditioning. While authorities haven't ruled out other buildings, they say the tower on St-Joseph Street played an important role in the outbreak in that city. Authorities say the illness has been brought under control because they have disinfected the cooling systems in more than 100 buildings in the area.

[For a discussion of Legionnaires' disease, see ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - UK (02): (Scotland) 20120605.1156972.

The numbers of total cases and fatalities have not changed since the last ProMED-mail post: there are a total of 180 cases, including 13 fatalities.

We were told in a prior ProMED-mail post on this outbreak that specimens from 9 patients have grown _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1; all 9 organisms have the same genotype, which suggested there is a common source for at least these 9 patients, and we are now told that the genotype of _Legionella pneumophila_ in samples taken from a cooling tower in a building in Quebec City's lower-town area match the genotype of the strain of _Legionella_ found in patients. However, we are not told of the relationship of the cases to this cooling tower. The effect of wind speed and direction on _Legionella_-contaminated plumes from cooling towers may influence the distribution of cases.
