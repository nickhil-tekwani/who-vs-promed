The first case of [a hantavirus infection in Vermont has been confirmed in
Washington County, the Vermont Health Department reported Friday.
The Health Department is alerting health care providers statewide of the
case and is urging all Vermonters to take precautions against becoming
infected from mouse droppings that might contain the potentially lethal
virus. Meanwhile, the Health Department is conducting an investigation of
the case centering on Washington County, including conducting interviews
with people to pinpoint the likely site of exposure, and setting traps for
mice to obtain study samples.
Confirmation of the state's first case of human infection with the virus
came from labs at the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. It is
only the second case of [a hantavirus infection in New England.
Officials would not reveal the name of the person infected, or where the
person lived or is likely to have contracted the virus, but state
Epidemiologist Peter
Galbraith said the infected patient was an adult Vermont resident who was
being treated in Vermont and appeared to be recovering fully.
Galbraith said health officials in Vermont were not shocked by the
confirmation of a hantavirus case in Vermont; he said given the steady
spread of the disease through a very common carrier species, and [given
the occurrence of cases in Pennsylvania, New York, and Rhode Island, it may
have been only a matter of time before Vermont had a first case. He could
not recall any other cases in Vermont when physicians felt the need to
order lab testing on a patient for possible hantavirus.

[The original of this article was much longer than appears above. It
contained much useful information and some misinformation. For one, the
disease is not correctly called "hantavirus". It may be "a hantavirus"
(one of many hantaviruses) that causes the disease but the disease should
be called "a hantavirus infection" or "infection with a hantavirus" or
"hantavirus pulmonary syndrome", depending on the clinical characteristics.
Of course, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is caused by any of a
number of hantaviruses.
As both _Peromyscus maniculatus_ (deer mouse) and _Peromyscus leucopus_
(white-footed mouse) are known to occur in Vermont, the etiologic agent of
this human infection in Vermont might be either Sin Nombre virus or New
York virus, associated with deer mice and white-footed mice, respectively.
As for the statement that there has been a "steady spread of the disease
through a very common carrier species, and the occurrence of cases in
Pennsylvania, New York, and Rhode Island, it may have been only a matter of
time before Vermont had a first case", this is most likely not the case.
There is no evidence that either Sin Nombre virus or New York virus has
widened its geographic distribution or that the rodent hosts of these
viruses are spreading to new areas. What is likely is that the disease is
being more widely recognized and that Vermont has finally identified one.
As I recall, the Rhode Island fatality acquired his infection on Long
Island (New York); the Pennsylvania case died of a infection caused by a
hantavirus most closely related to Sin Nombre virus.
None of the above matters clinically, of course. Vermont health officials
are initiating surveys (serological and tissue sampling) of rodents in
Washington County and the results of these studies will provide information
regarding the prevalence of the virus(es) in that area.
The article also said that "HPS can strike anyone, at any age". This may
be true but young children have not been shown to have had HPS in the U.S.
