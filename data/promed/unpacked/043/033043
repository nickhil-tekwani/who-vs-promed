Norway: outbreak of sexually transmitted hepatitis A among men
-----------------------------------------------
The Norwegian Department of Infectious Diseases has reported an outbreak of
sexually transmitted hepatitis A among gay men in the country. 150 cases
were reported in the country from 1 Jan 2004 through 18 Oct 2004, up from
52 cases during the same period in 2003. About 46 percent of the cases were
determined to be due to sexual transmission between gay men; 51 of the 69
cases among gay men were reported in Oslo.
Health officials began offering free hepatitis A vaccinations to gay men in
Oslo and Bergen this summer [2004], which some officials say has helped
slow the sexually transmitted disease's (STD's) spread. There also has been
a public health campaign in gay venues in Oslo about the STD.
Similar outbreaks of hepatitis A have been reported in Denmark, Sweden, and
the United Kingdom this year [2004]. U.K. health officials also have
reported outbreaks of the STDs shigellosis and lymphogranuloma venereum --
a rare form of chlamydia -- among gay men this year.

[Outbreaks of hepatitis A as a STD in men who have sex with men have been
increasing in number and extent in Europe since around 2000. Outbreaks have
been described in Denmark, England, and the Netherlands already this year
[2004], and behavioral risk factors and treatment protocols have been
defined. Detailed accounts of these recent outbreaks can be found in the
ProMED-mail posts listed below. - Mod.CP]
