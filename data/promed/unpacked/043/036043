Between 15 May and 3 July, 1998, more than 100 probable cases of dengue
fever have been reported from the Port Vila area of Vanuatu.
During that time, over 2,300 individuals presented to the Outpatients
Department at Vila Central Hospital (VCH) with non-malaria febrile illness,
an increase of 150% over the background incidence of fever. Some of these
individuals had an illness consistent with dengue fever (DF), while many
others had a classical influenza-like syndrome.
Of 321 serum specimens collected between 22 and 29 May from VCH outpatients
with a febrile illness, 52 tested positive to either anti-dengue IgM and/or
IgG using the the PanBio rapid immunochromatographic test; 24 of the 52
patients had a presentation consistent with classical dengue, while the
rest had undifferentiated fever. Eight specimens were confirmed by EIA
and/or PCR by the State Health Arbovirus Reference Laboratory in Brisbane,
Australia. The prevailing serotype was identified as DEN-2.
Using a clinical case definition, 107 clinically compatible cases of dengue
were diagnosed to 3 July, including 13 patients who were admitted with
illnesses clinically compatible with dengue haemorrhagic fever/dengue shock
syndrome (DHF/DSS). There have been no fatalities.
All affected individuals were resident in the greater Port Vila area.
The Vanuatu Department of Health implemented the following outbreak
response in late May:
a) Notification of regional health centres around the country.
b) Enhancement of surveillance for dengue, both at VCH and nationally.
c) Issuing of a media release, advising the public of actions to be taken
to minimise the spread of dengue and what to do in the event of a febrile
illness.
d) Emergency vector control and environmental hygiene measures in areas of
Port Vila where dengue transmission had been confirmed or where a large
number of fever cases had occurred.
e) Enhancement of vector control and environmental hygiene in other areas
of Vanuatu.
f) Workshops, conducted by SPC and VCH staff, for clinicians on the
recognition and management of DF and DHF/DSS.
g) Workshops for VCH Malaria Laboratory staff to teach malaria
microscopists to perform platelet counts at the same time as malaria
parasite examinations.
Within 2 weeks of commencement of intensive mosquito control activities,
there was a sharp reduction in the number of clinically compatible cases of
dengue presenting to VCH. Concurrent presentations for "flu-like" illness
also waned.
The most likely scenario is that concurrent outbreaks of dengue and a
respiratory virus have occurred, and that rapid implementation of vector
control, environmental and community management, assisted by the arrival of
cooler and drier weather, promptly blocked further spread of dengue.
The alternative scenario, that this was an outbreak purely of a flu-like
illness, with enhanced surveillance detecting a background, sporadic cases
of dengue, cannot be disproven. However, the number of admissions with
typical DHF suggests this is not the case.
Surveillance activities will now revert to a combination of fever
surveillance (using malaria slide negativity rates from the VCH Malaria
Laboratory), serological screening (using the PanBio rapid test), and
sentinel clinicians.

[Given that this dengue 2 virus epidemic has been occurring since at least
May and likely before that, the use of single serum IgM or IgG assays for
diagnosis will provide inaccurate diagnoses. Basing such diagnoses on such
tests in an area in which other, clinically undifferentiated, illnesses are
also occurring, these numbers cannot be considered definitive. Tony has
used the term "probable", which is correct, but more definitive testing is
required. If eight specimens were confirmed by EIA (whatever that means)
or PCR, it would be useful to know how many were tested, i.e., 8/8 or 8/?.
