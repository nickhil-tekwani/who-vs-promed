Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) and Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) have discovered chronic wasting disease (CWD) in a deer breeding facility in Limestone County. This marks the 1st positive detection of the disease in the county.

As part of a required CWD surveillance program, samples from 4 deer were detected with CWD prions by the Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory in College Station on 5 Sep [2022]. The National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa, confirmed CWD in 2 of these samples on 13 Sep [2022] and should complete testing of the other 2 samples soon.

Animal health and wildlife officials have taken action to secure the facility and identify and notify other breeding facilities that received deer from or shipped deer to this facility in the last 5 years.

"TPWD and TAHC are taking this situation very seriously," said John Silovsky, wildlife division director for TPWD. "Fortunately, these positive cases were detected early, and we have a good sample distribution across the facility. At this time, CWD appears to be contained to one pen within the facility. Animal health and wildlife officials will continue to investigate to determine the extent of the disease within the facility and mitigate risks to Texas' CWD susceptible species. Quick detection of CWD can help mitigate the disease's spread."

TPWD officials are developing surveillance zone boundaries that may include portions of Limestone, Hill, Freestone, and Navarro counties. CWD zones are an effective strategy for managing and containing the disease. Hunters in surveillance and containment zones must take harvested CWD-susceptible species to a check station or otherwise meet submission requirements. TPWD will provide additional information to landowners and hunters within the surveillance zone regarding CWD sampling locations and options to have their deer or other CWD-susceptible species tested (there is no cost to the hunter for this testing). A public meeting will be held in Limestone County prior to implementation to provide the details of the zones and CWD management.

"Surveillance is an essential part of managing CWD," said Dr. Andy Schwartz, TAHC executive director and state veterinarian. "While the disease's incubation period poses challenges, quick detection can help mitigate the disease's spread and protect cervid populations in Texas."

Testing for CWD allows wildlife biologists and animal health officials to get a clearer picture of the prevalence and distribution of the disease across Texas. Proactive monitoring improves the state's response time to a CWD detection and can greatly reduce the risk of the disease spreading further to neighboring captive and free-ranging populations.

TPWD and TAHC encourage hunters outside of established surveillance and containment zones to voluntarily submit their harvest for testing at a check station, for free, before heading home from the field. A map of TPWD check stations can be found on the TPWD website.

First recognized in 1967 in captive mule deer in Colorado, CWD has since been documented in captive and/or free-ranging deer in 30 states and 3 Canadian provinces. To date, 392 captive or free-ranging cervids -- including white-tailed deer, mule deer, red deer, and elk -- in 16 Texas counties have tested positive for CWD.

CWD is a fatal neurological disease found in certain cervids, including deer, elk, moose, and other members of the deer family. The disease is highly transmissible and can remain infectious on the landscape for several years. If left unmanaged, CWD can have long-term impacts on the native deer herd and local economies. Clinical signs may include progressive weight loss; stumbling or tremors with a lack of coordination; excessive thirst, salivation, or urination; loss of appetite; teeth grinding; abnormal head posture; and/or drooping ears. These signs may not become evident until long after animals have become infected. Therefore, testing remains the best available tool for detecting CWD at an early stage and containing it with appropriate management strategies.

To date, there is no evidence that CWD poses a risk to humans or non-cervids. However, as a precaution, the US Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization recommend not to consume meat from infected animals.

Chronic wasting disease (CWD) has been discovered in a deer breeding facility in Gillespie County. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) and Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) are collaboratively working to determine the source and extent of the 1st positive detection of the disease in this county.

After the mortality of a white-tailed deer on the premises was identified, tissue samples from the one-year-old buck were submitted by the deer breeding facility as part of a required CWD surveillance program. The samples were tested at the Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory (TVMDL) in College Station on 17 Aug [2022] and indicated the presence of CWD. The National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa, confirmed CWD in those tissue samples on 30 Aug [2022].

Immediate action has been taken to secure all deer located at the facility and plans to conduct additional CWD investigations are underway. Additionally, other breeding facilities having received deer or shipped deer to this facility during the last 5 years have been identified and placed under movement restrictions.

"Response staff are diligently working to conduct epidemiological investigations, but the nature of the disease makes definitive findings difficult to determine," said Dr. Andy Schwartz, TAHC state veterinarian. "The incubation period of CWD can span years, creating disease detection and management challenges."

Animal health and wildlife officials will investigate to determine the extent of the disease within the facility and mitigate risks to Texas' CWD susceptible species. Quick detection of CWD can help mitigate the disease's spread.

"The discovery of CWD in this breeding facility is an unfortunate situation that TPWD and TAHC take very seriously," said John Silovsky, wildlife division director for TPWD. "Both agencies will respond appropriately to this matter to protect the state's susceptible species from further disease exposure."

First recognized in 1967 in captive mule deer in Colorado, CWD has since been documented in captive and/or free-ranging deer in 30 states and 3 Canadian provinces. To date, 376 captive or free-ranging cervids -- including white-tailed deer, mule deer, red deer, and elk -- in 15 Texas counties have tested positive for CWD. For more information on previous detections visit the CWD page on the TPWD website.

With each discovery of a new CWD-positive area in the state, CWD zones are established as a strategy to manage and contain the disease. TPWD officials will be working towards delineating and establishing a new zone in Gillespie County to be implemented later this fall.

Hunters in surveillance and containment zones must meet submission requirements of harvested CWD-susceptible species. TPWD will be providing additional information to landowners and hunters in Gillespie County regarding CWD sampling locations and options to have their deer tested. Additionally, hunters outside of established surveillance and containment zones are encouraged to voluntarily submit their harvest for testing at a check station, for free, before heading home from the field. A map of TPWD check stations for all CWD zones can be found on the TPWD website.

A Wisconsin deer farm has been struck by chronic wasting disease. Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection officials say the farm in Taylor County had a 6-year-old doe test positive for CWD last fall, and the farm was immediately quarantined, meaning no live animals or whole carcasses could leave the farm.

Two hundred thirty-eight deer were depopulated. DATCP officials say 61 of them tested positive for the fatal neurological disease.

Chronic wasting disease is caused by prions affecting the brain of cervids including deer, elk, and moose.

The farm will not be permitted to have cervids for 5 years, and it must maintain fences and submit to routine inspections. The farm owner will receive federal indemnity for the depopulated animals.

This is the 5th deer farm affected by CWD in 2022. Earlier in August [2022], 20 animals were depopulated at a Waukesha County farm. Eight of those deer tested positive for CWD. In June [2022], 47 deer were depopulated at a Langlade County farm under quarantine since last year [2021], but none of them tested positive for the disease. A Walworth County farm was placed under quarantine in May [2022] after a deer tested positive for the disease. A Waukesha County farm was also placed in quarantine in February [2022] after 2 3-year-old bucks tested positive.

[ProMED posts the 1st incidence of chronic wasting disease in a county or territory. Subsequent cases are not posted. It appears this may be the 1st case in Taylor County (WI) and in Limestone and Gillespie counties, both in Texas.

Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a neurological, degenerative disease of parts of the brain.

Hunters will surely have new regulations to be aware of by the next hunting season. Some counties in Wisconsin are already familiar with CWD hunting regulations.

Generally, meat from CWD is not consumed by humans out of an abundance of caution.

The causative agent for CWD is a prion. Prions have been linked to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease. Consequently, it is believed this prion disease could have similar negative consequences.

"Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal, neurological illness occurring in North American cervids (members of the deer family), including white-tailed deer, mule deer, elk, and moose. Since its discovery in 1967, CWD has spread geographically and increased in prevalence locally. CWD is contagious; it can be transmitted freely within and among cervid populations. No treatments or vaccines are currently available.

"Chronic wasting disease is of great concern to wildlife managers. It has been detected in at least 23 states, 2 Canadian provinces, and South Korea. CWD is not known to infect livestock or humans.

"CWD is transmitted directly through animal-to-animal contact, and indirectly through contact with objects or environments contaminated with infectious material (including saliva, urine, feces, and carcasses of CWD-infected animals)."
