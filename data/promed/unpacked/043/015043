Health officials in Badakhshan province say that due to the outbreak of measles 113 children have become "casualties" of measles in the past 3 months in the province.

According to health officials, during this period more than 3400 people in the provincial center and districts have been infected with the disease.

"We had 113 casualties. The casualties were mostly in Kufaab, Nassi, Yaftal districts, and outside the center's territory," said Qari Nazir Ahmad Nizar, Badakhshan's deputy for public health.

Meanwhile, doctors said that cold, anorexia, high fever, cough, and itchy skin are the symptoms of measles.

"Most of the measles patients that come to the hospital have severe (skin issues) or have severe diarrhoea, for which we hospitalize them," said Shafiq Hamdard, the hospital's chief physician.

The outbreak of this disease has caused raised alarms among residents of Badakhshan.

"We ask the government and the World Health Organization, to make a serious decision about this disease in order to prevent its further spread," said Mohibullah Sadat, a resident of Badakhshan.

Previously, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the rapid rise of measles in Afghanistan threatens the lives and health of millions of malnourished children.

The Ministry of Public Health says that the number of children infected with measles has increased significantly this year [2022] compared to previous years.

According to ministry officials, more than 40 000 children have been infected with measles this year [2022].

"By the end of May [2022], we will have about 10 million doses of vaccine, and after May we will launch a vaccine campaign across Afghanistan to respond," said Javid Hajir, spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health.

Hajir considers the lack of a measles vaccination campaign to be one of the main reasons for the increase in the disease in the country and said that to combat the illness the ministry is launching a new measles vaccination campaign.

Based on the statistics of the Ministry of Health, the statistics of measles cases and deaths from 2018 to 2022 are as follows:
- In 2018, 29 872 patients were infected, 215 deaths
- In 2019, 4187 patients were infected, 10 deaths
- In 2020, 5234 patients were infected, 18 deaths
- In 2021, 30 333 patients were infected, 108 deaths
- And in 2022, 44 200 patients were infected, and 288 deaths.

[P] and [S] are mothers whose children have been hospitalized due to measles. "We do not have good food. I wish we had access to good food. My husband got disabled at a young age," said the mother of the sick child.

"3 days ago he had a fever. Later I noticed that red spots appeared on him. I thought that it might have been because of an allergy ... I saw in the morning that he had a high fever and his condition had worsened," said the mother of the other sick child.

Some doctors believe that the reason for the increase in this disease is the poor quality of vaccines.

"Even though people are vaccinated, they are still contracting it. The quality of vaccines should be considered in terms of how the vaccine is stored, whether it is professional or not," said Mohammad Iqbal Sadegh, chief physician of Andragandi Children's Health Hospital.

However, the Ministry of Public Health said that the World Bank has for the 1st time approved USD 150 million in humanitarian aid to Afghanistan, part of which, according to a ministry spokesman, will be allocated to fight measles.

[The number of cases is increasing every year, with nearly a 10-fold increase in cases and deaths from 2020 to 2021. A "Situation Analysis of Children and women in Afghanistan" was published in 2021 by UNICEF (https://www.unicef.org/afghanistan/media/6301/file/Summary-Situation%20Analysis.pdf) to evaluate the situation in Afghanistan. It stated:

"The neonatal and under-5 mortality rates remained high at 36 and 60 deaths respectively per 1000 live births in 2019, most of which were preventable deaths, caused mainly by preterm birth complications and infections. Immunization, which is key to reducing child mortality, registered some progress, particularly in terms of delivery scale and the number of antigens covered by the national immunization programme. However, a large part of the Afghan target population remains unprotected against life-threatening diseases. In 2018, 3 in 5 and 1 in 3 of the target population was not fully immunized against measles as well as diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis respectively (KIT Royal Tropical Institute, MoPH; NSIA, 2019).

"Lastly, the children's and women's nutritional situation is a serious cause for concern. Malnutrition was highly prevalent in 2018, with an estimated 38 percent and 5 percent of children under the age of 5 being moderately or severely stunted, and moderately or severely wasted, respectively. It is possible that these numbers do not fully capture the extent of the problem. Firstly, these estimates were significantly lower than what would be expected in light of provincial anthropometric surveys conducted in Afghanistan in 2018 (KIT Royal Tropical Institute, MoPH; NSIA, 2019). Secondly, these estimates are likely to underestimate the prevalence of malnutrition in 2021, as they do not fully capture the impacts of the 2018-2019 drought. Indeed, estimates based on more recent data (including nutrition surveys collected by the Nutrition Cluster Afghanistan in 2019) point to a fast year-over-year increase in global acute malnutrition (GAM) caseloads from 2018 to 2020."

Malnutrition will exacerbate measles infection. Action must be taken to provide nourishing food and vaccinations to the Afghan children in need. - Mod.LK
