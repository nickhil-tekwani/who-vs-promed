The Health Department of the Canary Islands has reported a total of 18
cases of salmonellosis this week and 7 of the affected are still
admitted in various hospitals in Tenerife. Following the 1st
investigations of the Health Department, infection might be linked to
a popular neighborhood cafeteria that this week has been the subject
of several visits by health inspectors. To this point, none of the
tests has concluded that this facility has caused the outbreak.

One of the affected individuals said that some of those affected ate
an a la carte dish made with chicken. The alleged meal was consumed
occurred last Friday night, 12 Aug 2011, and it was the day following
when the 1st symptoms of severe abdominal pain, fever, diarrhea, and
vomiting developed. The woman added that, "[the cafeteria] is a well
known establishment and always has customers. That particular night,
it was full. Although Ministry of Health has reported 18 cases, there
may be many more since, not all people go to the doctor."

While there are no positive results of tests to date, officials hope
to isolate the source of the salmonellosis outbreak and recall that
salmonellosis is a common condition in summer. The Health Department
stressed the importance of food and personal hygiene during the summer
months, not only in catering establishments but also when cooking at
home.

undercooked or if poor kitchen hygiene is practiced. The serotype of
