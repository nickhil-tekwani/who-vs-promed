In vitro and in vivo resistance to influenza virus neuraminidase
inhibitors
----------------------------------------------------------------------
-----
Recent in vitro studies have made it apparent that influenza virus may
be showing resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors. According to data
presented by Dr. Maria Zambon of the Public Health Laboratory Service
in London, in vitro and in vivo resistance to this new group of drugs
is increasing. Dr Zambon, a participant in the 7th Congress of the
Spanish Society of Virology, stated that the resistance phenomenon is
being generated through 2 mechanisms. Mutation of the viral
hemagglutinin, which reduces the adhesion affinity of the viral
receptor, facilitates the liberation of viral progeny and diminishes
the need for activity of the neuraminidase enzyme.
Such mutations seem also to reduce viral infectivity as they limit
binding efficiency to the point of entry. Nonetheless, it is not clear
which mutations may have clinical relevance to in vivo resistance to
neuraminidase inhibitors. Dr. Zambon explained that such [in vivo]
mutations have already been described. [They] are caused by [either] a
limitation in the activity of the catalytic enzyme, or [in its]
stability, and [are often triggered by] a reduction in [viral]
replication and virulence in vivo.
Dr. Zambon commented that the mutations in the neuraminidase enzyme
selected in vitro do not always predict those that will be observed in
vivo. [Moreover], the association between the [virus] phenotypes and
genotypes that appear during in vitro pharmacological exposure remains
unclear.
However, Dr. Zambon recognized that preclinical resistance studies in
animals and analyses [that monitor] isolates [from] human trials with
neuraminidase inhibitors suggest that resistance does not [ensue]
quickly. Therefore, she considered it necessary to develop long-term
studies in order to monitor the situation in target populations before
[the introduction of] neuraminidase inhibitors into clinical practice.
The next decade, in her judgement, will [determine] whether the
introduction of neuraminidase inhibitors will affect the evolution of
influenza virus, as they [may] generate a selective pressure [altering
hemagglutinin or neuraminidase activity].
