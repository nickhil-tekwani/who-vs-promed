Mesa County [Colorado] Public Health is investigating 8 confirmed cases of _E. coli_ in the area, that they say may be associated with the Mesa County Fair. The health department says they work closely with the fair on preventative measures, such as hand washing stations and signs at the event.

Health officials say it is not uncommon to see _E. coli_ outbreaks surrounding a fair because of the animals there. Health officials say _E. coli_ can have an incubation period of 10 days, and we now are past that threshold. That means they don't anticipate any more primary cases of the disease, but do encourage people to wash their hands to prevent it from spreading.

"Washing hands is one thing, but something people don't think is if you have a stroller, don't push it into the pen," explained Jeff Kuhr, the director of Mesa County Public Health. "Then you have contaminated wheels and you're pushing it through your house."

They are investigating the current cases to pinpoint the exact source of the disease.

[The state of Colorado can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=5243577,9201. Mesa County in western Colorado can be seen on the map at http://geology.com/county-map/colorado-county-map.gif. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ

Although not specifically stated, the fact that zoonotic spread is suggested from a county fair and the incubation appears to be long suggests strongly that this is an outbreak of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, either the prototypic O157:H7 serotype or an alternative Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_. ProMED-mail would appreciate more information about this outbreak.

Summer time fairs which contain petting zoos are a well described reservoir for human infection related to direct or indirect exposure to farm animals particularly cattle.

The CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/features/animalexhibits/) has offered this advice regarding human-livestock interactions:
"From watching calf roping at the rodeo to petting lambs at the county fair, there are many ways to explore the animal world this spring and summer. Exhibits such as petting zoos and fairs allow children of all ages to have the thrilling experience of coming face to face with animals. This interaction allows people to learn more about animals and helps to build an important human-animal bond.

"Unfortunately, many people become sick every year because of a visit to an animal exhibit. It is important to remember that animals sometimes carry germs that are harmful to humans. When people forget to wash their hands after petting an animal or bring food into an area where animals are being housed, they are at risk for becoming ill.

"If you are visiting an animal exhibit:
- use hand-washing stations;
- find out where hand-washing stations are located;
- always wash your hands after petting animals or touching the animal enclosure, especially before eating and drinking;
- running water and soap are best. Use hand gels if running water and soap are not available.

"Food and drinks:
- keep food and drinks out of animal areas;
- do not share your food with animals;
- do not eat or drink raw (unpasteurized) dairy products.

"Children:
- children younger than 5 years old need supervision;
- never allow children to put their hands or objects (for example, pacifiers) in their mouths while interacting with animals;
- hand washing should be supervised."
