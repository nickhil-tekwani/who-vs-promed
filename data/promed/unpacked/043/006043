Anthrax in animals
------------------
In a household in the village of Bocar (Household A) in the north-eastern part of the APV, [Autonomous Province of Vojvodina] one heifer died on 2 Jun 2011. This death was not recognised at the time as caused by anthrax and was not reported to the veterinary authorities. The heifer was butchered in another household (Household B) on the next day.

A routine investigation of the unexplained death of the heifer took place 4 days later, on 6 Jun 2011 by the veterinary institute and veterinary centres of the 2 districts Zrenjanin and Kikinda, as Bocar is situated on the border of these districts. The veterinary inspection detected another 2 sick animals (horse and heifer) in Household A. Samples were taken from the ear muscles of those 2 animals. The presence of _Bacillus anthracis_ was established on 7 Jun 2011 by deep isolation agar and Ascoli precipitin test [13].

In Household B, a goat died on 19 Jun 2011. The presence of _B. anthracis_ was confirmed in a tissue sample. In another village Novo Milosevo, about 10 kilometres [6 mi] away from Bocar, a sick cow was reported on 17 Jun 2011, which subsequently died on 22 Jun 2011, with microbiologically confirmed anthrax.

Clinically ill animals have fever, difficulty in breathing, with bloody discharges from natural openings in the heifer. The animals died within 2 or 3 days after beginning of symptoms. Common to all ill animals was that they were pastured in areas recently covered with high groundwater. The dead animals had not been vaccinated against anthrax.

Human cases of anthrax
----------------------
From 5 to 9 Jun 2011, cutaneous anthrax was diagnosed in 3 workers who were in contact with the 1st dead heifer during slaughter, and had not had any contact with the other sick animals. They were classified as probable cases of anthrax based on epidemiological and clinical data. Skin manifestation occurred on the patients' hands after the incubation period of 1 to 2 days [13], followed by high fever, without any other symptoms. The infection started as a pruritic papula. In 2 days the papula enlarged and formed an ulcer, about 2 cm in diameter, with typical black central crust. There was oedema of the ulcer and surrounding skin. The skin lesions were painless. The patients were treated with antibiotic therapy 15 days at home and recovered. No laboratory diagnostic tests were done on the human patients.

A further 5 persons who had been exposed to dead animals were followed up for 24 days during the incubation period, but no clinical signs and symptoms appeared. No human deaths were reported in the area in that period which that could have been due to undiagnosed anthrax. Meat from infected animals was not consumed because the carcasses were destroyed after appropriate transport. The meat from the 1st slaughtered heifer was not available for investigation and may have been used to feed pets.

Control measures
----------------
After the outbreak was reported following the death of the 2nd animal, the veterinary authorities ordered control measures:
- a ban on releasing animals from the infected pastures for the duration of the outbreak and the risk of spread (6 weeks);
- a ban on the slaughter of sick animals;
- prohibition of the use of milk and dairy products, or meat, skin, and other products, as well as the sale of animals with clinical manifestation of illness or suspected to infection;
- vaccination of cattle, sheep, goats, and Equidae;
- prohibition of butchering of dead and sick animals;
- disinfection of places where a dead animal had been kept.

The population of affected areas was encouraged to report all animal deaths to the veterinary authorities, to treat carcasses of dead animals only in accordance with the instructions of experts, to limit the number of persons present in contaminated yards, to use protective equipment in contact with the animals and to disinfect it after use, and to contact a medical service immediately in case they developed fever or skin changes. Educational material about anthrax was distributed to households in affected areas.

[It is nice to see a complete epidemiologic report on these events in Serbia. Members are encouraged to read the full report available at the source URL above, as I have not included the introduction, the conclusions, or the references in order to save space. Unfortunately I fear that if these 3 young men had not been affected, no such investigation would have been run. One has to realise that human cases of anthrax are most cost effectively prevented by preventing any and all livestock cases first, primarily by vaccination. - Mod.MHJ]
