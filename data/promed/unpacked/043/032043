[With the addition of these 8 newly confirmed cases, including 2 deaths and 3 additional deaths in previously confirmed cases, the total number of reported laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infections in Saudi Arabia is now 491 including 147 deaths. What is notable in yesterday's (11 May 2014) and today's reports from Saudi Arabia is the absence of mention of asymptomatic laboratory infections with MERS-CoV that were detected through contact screening. It is not clear as to whether there have not been additional asymptomatic contacts who are positive for MERS-CoV infection, or whether a decision was made not to report asymptomatic infections as part of the daily reports.

Of the 8 newly confirmed cases reported today, 3 were reported to have been hospitalized prior to the onset of respiratory symptoms (2 in Riyadh, 1 in AlMadinah), suggesting that transmission of the infection occurred within the healthcare environment. Another 2 cases had a history of known exposure to MERS-CoV infected individuals (both in Jeddah).

CDC announces 2nd imported case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in the United States
----------------------------------
CDC and Florida Department of Health officials are investigating the 2nd case of MERS-CoV infection in the United States. MERS-CoV, a virus relatively new to humans, was 1st reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. On [2 May 2014], CDC reported the 1st case of MERS in the United States.

[A press briefing was held on 12 May 2014; this moderator attended. The official text of the press briefing was pending at the time of preparation of this post, but in summary:

A health care worker (HCW) living and working in Saudi Arabia came to visit family in the USA. The individual flew from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia to London on 1 May 2014, connected to a flight to Boston, MA, USA then another flight from Boston, MA, USA to Atlanta, GA and another flight from Atlanta, GA to Orlando FL. The individual began feeling unwell on the initial flight from Jeddah to London, with fever, chills and cough. On 8 May 2014, the individual presented to an emergency room at a hospital in Orlando [?] Florida and was admitted to the hospital. Exact timing of implementation of isolation and infection control measures was not provided but was presented as fairly rapid. Tests were done for MERS-CoV infection (tests prepared by CDC) and were confirmed by CDC on 11 May 2014.

The individual reportedly did not travel around Florida after arriving from Saudi Arabia. Information on age, gender, and the health care facility where the individual worked in Saudi Arabia was not given. Efforts underway include contact tracing of all individuals on all flights taken by this individual (more than 500 individuals in the USA, plus more on the flight from Jeddah to London); the family and known close contacts are on home isolation until 14 days following exposure, the estimated maximum incubation period.

According to CDC, the risk to travellers and others with general community exposure to this individual is considered quite low as MERS-CoV has not been demonstrated to spread easily in the community and requires close contact for spread. It was pointed out that with the travel related exposure occurring in the 1st day or so of May 2014, individuals travelling on the same flights as this individual were approaching the maximum incubation period since exposure -- 14 days --- and most likely would have been symptomatic by now if they had been infected.

According to the CDC, the latest WHO figures on the global burden of MERS-CoV as of 12 May 2014 show that there have been 538 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection globally including 145 deaths, with Saudi Arabia reporting 450 laboratory confirmed cases including 118 deaths.

[3] Jordan, new fatality - media report
Date: 12 May 2014

A man has died in Jordan after being infected with the MERS virus, the government said Monday [12 May 2014], on the eve of a World Health Organization emergency meeting on the disease.

The latest death brings to 5 the number of fatalities in Jordan from the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus since it 1st emerged in 2012.

The man, in his 50s, worked in a private hospital and died on Saturday [10 May 2014], the health ministry said.

The announcement came after Saudi Arabia on Sunday [11 May 2014] reported that 3 new deaths from MERS had taken its death toll from the disease to 142.

MERS has now infected 483 people in the Gulf kingdom since it 1st appeared in 2012, accounting for the vast majority of the 496 cases registered worldwide.

It is considered a deadlier but less-transmissible cousin of the SARS virus that erupted in Asia in 2003, infecting 8273 people and killing nearly 800.

Like SARS, it appears to cause a lung infection, with patients suffering coughing, breathing difficulties and a temperature, but MERS differs in that it also causes rapid kidney failure.

Although most MERS infections have been in Saudi Arabia, cases have also been recorded in the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon and the United States [Greece, Malaysia, Kuwait, Yemen, UK, Germany, Tunisia, Italy].

Most cases outside Saudi Arabia involve people who had travelled to the kingdom or worked there, often as medical staff.

The UN's health agency WHO is to hold an emergency meeting Tuesday [13 May 2014] to discuss the worrying spread of MERS.

"The increase in the number of cases in different countries raises a number of questions," WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said on Friday [9 May 2014], without elaborating.

[4] Saudi Arabia, alert for camel contact - media report
Date: 11 May 2014
Source: Reuters [edited]
http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/11/us-health-saudi-camels-idUSKBN0DR06520140511


Saudi Arabia said people handling camels should wear masks and gloves to prevent spreading Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), issuing such a warning for the 1st time as cases of the potentially fatal virus neared 500 in the kingdom.

Health experts say camels are the most likely animal source of infection for the disease, which the Saudi Health Ministry said on Sunday [11 May 2014] 3 more people had caught and 4 had died from.

1st reported 2 years ago in Saudi Arabia, MERS is a coronavirus like SARS, which originated in animals and killed around 800 people worldwide after 1st appearing in China in 2002. There is no vaccine or anti-viral treatment against it.

Around a 3rd of the 483 diagnosed with MERS in Saudi Arabia have died.

Saudi Arabia is still the focal point of the outbreak, although cases have been reported in other Middle Eastern countries, in Europe, and in the United States, which had its 1st confirmed case last month [April 2014].

The link between human cases and camels -- which have a special place in Saudi society -- is the subject of extensive study among scientists abroad. But it has been relatively absent from much of the official domestic debate.

In a statement, the Agriculture Ministry advised people not to come into contact with camels unless necessary and to wash hands before and after if they did, as well as wearing face masks, state news agency SPA said on Sunday [11 May 2014].

"It is advisable to wear protective gloves, especially when dealing with births or sick or dead (camels)," it said, according to SPA. It also advised only eating cooked camel meat and to boil camel milk before consuming it. The statement urged people to report symptoms of MERS in camels immediately.

Only one of dozens of people working near an auction pen in Riyadh's camel market on Sunday [11 May 2014] was wearing a mask, and there were no signs of any official visit from the authorities, a Reuters photographer said.

Public disquiet in Saudi Arabia has grown amid rumors on social media sites about a lack of transparency from officials about the spread of the disease. The recent upsurge in reported cases is also of wider concern, not least because of the influx of visitors from around the world expected in July [2014] during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, and again during the annual Haj pilgrimage in October [2014].

In a move the Health Ministry said was aimed at countering the spread of the virus, Riyadh on Tuesday [6 May 2014] replaced the head of the King Fahd Hospital in Jeddah, where many of the new cases have been recorded.

The World Health Organization said outbreaks of MERS in the city's 2 main hospitals were partly due to breaches in its recommended infection prevention and control measures.

After a 5-day mission in Saudi Arabia, WHO also said there has been no significant change in the virus's ability to spread. Scientists say MERS does not transmit easily between people.

The Health Ministry 1st linked MERS with camels at a news conference last month [April 2014], but the Agriculture Ministry statement was the 1st official notification for those working with the animals.

Camels provide a link to an important but vanishing nomadic tradition in Saudi Arabia. They can be traded for thousands of dollars, and some are entered into races, which are popular across the Gulf region.

Traders, breeders, vets, and handlers at the main animal market in Riyadh told Reuters last month [April 2014] that authorities had given them no advice or warning about the link between camels and MERS.

[The salient instructions given by the Agricultural Ministry while reportedly aimed at individuals working with camels, is worded in such a manner that it could be interpreted as a national caution for individuals:
- avoid direct contact with camels unless necessary
- wash hands before and after if there is contact with camels
- wear face masks when having contact with camels
- wear protective gloves, especially when dealing with births or sick or dead (camels)
- eat only cooked camel meat
- boil camel milk before consuming it

These directives are aimed at reducing potential exposure to MERS-CoV infection from camels. Needless to say, there have been significant issues within the country, given the importance of camels for everyday life in the country and in the region. Camels are a livelihood for individuals; they are farmed, raced, and used for transport. Their milk, urine, and meat are consumed, oftentimes uncooked. Avoiding contact carries the implication of significant cultural change, not an easy control measure to implement by Public Health and other ministries.

If this moderator's calculations are correct, with the addition of the cases reported yesterday (11 May 2014: 3 cases, 3 deaths) and today (12 May 2014: 9 cases, 6 deaths), globally there have now been 581 laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infected individuals including 174 deaths. The difference in the numbers cited by CDC/WHO above may reflect either delayed reporting or may not include the asymptomatic infections that had been reported by Saudi Arabia earlier. - Mod.MPP
