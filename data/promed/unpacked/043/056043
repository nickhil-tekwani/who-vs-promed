OTTAWA -- La fromagerie Fritz Kaiser Inc. of Noyan, Que. is warning the
public not to consume its surface ripened soft cheese commonly know as
Empereur or Reblochon, because the product may contain the bacteria
responsible for listeriosis in humans. The soft cheese product was sold
between October 26 and 31, 1998 only at the counter of its manufacturing
plant in Noyan, Quebec in unlabelled bulk units.
Listeriosis is a potentially life-threatening illness caused by _Listeria
monocytogenes_ bacteria. Young children, the elderly, and people with
weakened immune systems are particularly at risk. Listeriosis can cause
mothers in the first three months of pregnancy to miscarry.
La fromagerie Fritz Kaiser Inc. is voluntarily recalling the cheese
product. Food contaminated with _Listeria monocytogenes_ bacteria will not
look or smell spoiled. Consumers can dispose of the product or return the
product to the plant in Noyan, Quebec for a refund. Consumers can contact
La fromagerie Fritz Kaiser Inc. for further information at (450) 294-2207.
There are no reported illnesses from this product to date.
