The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) and Ottawa County Health Department on Tuesday [14 Jul 2020] confirmed the state's first human infection with a mosquitoborne virus for 2020 as a county resident tested positive for Jamestown Canyon virus.

Jamestown Canyon virus is spread to people through bites from infected mosquitoes. Most cases occur from late spring through mid-fall. Illness can develop from a few days to 2 weeks following a mosquito bite. While most people do not become ill, initial symptoms can include fever, headache, and fatigue. In rare cases, it can cause severe disease, including infection of the brain, encephalitis, or the lining around the brain and spinal cord, meningitis.

MDHHS is releasing no further information about the resident who tested positive for confidentiality reasons.

"During the warm weather months in Michigan, there is always a risk of viruses spread by mosquitoes, including but not limited to West Nile virus and eastern equine encephalitis," said Dr Joneigh Khaldun, MDHHS chief medical executive and chief deputy director for health. "This is an important reminder to stay vigilant and protect against mosquito bites throughout the summer and into the fall."

Michigan reported its 1st 2 cases of Jamestown Canyon virus in 2018 in patients from Oakland and Menominee counties. In 2019, one case was detected in a person from Cass County. While the virus is found throughout much of the US, reports have been increasing in the upper Midwest. This likely reflects increased awareness and testing but may also be due to an increase in the presence of the virus in the environment.

The virus can be spread by many types of mosquitoes that become infected when they feed on deer or other animals that have the virus in their blood. These infected mosquitoes can then spread the virus to other animals or people through bites.

Residents can stay healthy by using simple, effective strategies to protect themselves and their families. The following steps are recommended to avoid Jamestown Canyon virus and other mosquito-borne diseases:
- Apply insect repellents that contain the active ingredient DEET, or other EPA-approved products, to exposed skin or clothing. Always follow the manufacturer's directions for use.
- Wear light-colored, long-sleeved shirts and long pants when outdoors. Apply insect repellent to clothing to help prevent bites.
- Maintain window and door screening to help keep mosquitoes outside.
- Empty water from mosquito breeding sites around the home, such as buckets, unused kiddie pools, old tires, or similar sites where mosquitoes lay eggs.

[Michigan is well within the geographic range of Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV). Transmission will continue until the first adult mosquito-killing frosts occur in October, so the public should adopt the recommendations listed above to avoid mosquito bites.

As noted in previous ProMED-mail posts, JCV was first isolated from a pool of 9 _Culiseta inornata_ mosquitoes captured in Jamestown Canyon, Colorado, in 1961 and later shown to be widely distributed in the eastern and midwestern USA. Boreal [northern] aedes and ochlerotatus mosquitoes are the primary vectors. As with the other California serogroup orthobunyaviruses, transovarial virus transmission is common, with newly emerging female mosquitoes already infected with the virus in the spring and ready to transmit it. White-tailed deer, _Odocoileus virginianus_, are the principal amplification hosts.

As Drs Charles Calisher and Paul Grimstad pointed out in ProMED-mail archive no. 20040807.2171, JCV frequently seems to be forgotten as an etiological agent of human disease. The previous report provided related references. - Mod.TY
