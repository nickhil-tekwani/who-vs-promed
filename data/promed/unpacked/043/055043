Veterinarians from Hagyard Equine Medical Center, in Lexington, Kentucky, have confirmed leptospirosis in a Kentucky Thoroughbred weanling, according to a 10 Aug 2012 post on the clinic's Facebook page.

Christopher Smith, DVM, and Nathan Slovis, DVM, Dipl ACVIM, confirmed the case. "The weanling was noted to have fever, lethargy, inappetance, and mild elevation of the kidney values noted on blood work," the statement read.

"Dr Smith is currently treating the weanling with penicillin for its kidney disease associated with leptospirosis. Diagnosis was made by convalescent serum titer."

Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease found worldwide that affects many species, including horses and people. Horses are infected when bacteria enter through the skin or mucosal membranes of the eye or mouth by contact with infected animals' blood, urine, or tissues. The infection can also occur when horses splash infected urine into their eyes or by eating hay or feed contaminated by infected urine.

If you are new to raising horses, the Breeder's Guide to Mare, Foal, and Stallion Care is a comprehensive guide that covers topics ranging from a mare's reproductive cycle to problem pregnancies to the latest trends in good stallion management to common foal problems and diseases.

Once infected, horses can experience fever, become listless, and/or go off their feed. Owners often see eyes with squinting, blinking, cloudiness, tearing, and swelling. Pregnant mares can lose their foals late in gestation. Adult horses can die of liver and/or kidney failure and might show jaundice in the latter stages of the disease.

Hagyard's post explained that leptospirosis is normally identified in the fall and early winter in Central Kentucky. "It is unusual to diagnose during the summertime," the statement read. Owners should monitor horses for signs of disease, and consult a veterinarian about leptospirosis if concerns arise.

[This article does not indicate if the veterinarians are concerned about the normal sequelae of uveitis.

Leptospirosis in horses is most commonly associated with uveitis or abortions. The disease is typically seen as a self-limiting mild fever with anorexia, although in severe forms hemolysis and vasculitis can result in petechial hemorrhages on mucosal surfaces, hemoglobinuria, anemia, icterus, conjunctival suffusion, depression, and weakness. Renal failure has been documented in foals. Recurrent uveitis (moon blindness) develops anytime from 2-8 months following the initial infection. Leptospirosis appears to be a significant cause of recurrent uveitis in horses, accounting for up to 67 per cent of the cases. Serovar Pomona and an unidentified serovar have been isolated from the aqueous humor of horses with uveitis. It is not clear whether the uveitis is due to intraocular infection or is immune-mediated. Leptospirosis is responsible for 3-4 per cent of all equine abortions annually, although flooding and other environmental catastrophes may result in abortion outbreaks. In the USA, serovar Pomona type Kennewicki appears to be the most significant cause of abortion. The prevalence of leptospirosis in horses is unknown, but serologic evidence indicates a higher incidence than is apparent clinically. In the USA, seroconversion to serovar Bratislava is reported in up to 40 per cent of horses in large population studies; horses may be a reservoir host for serovar Bratislava.

Measures for control and treatment are similar to those for cattle and pigs, but specific bacterins have not been developed for horses. Uveitis is treated symptomatically to reduce inflammation and prevent synechiae (adhesion of the iris to either the cornea or the lens).
