A spring surge is happening in cases of scarlet fever. Numbers of new infections of the contagious disease in Leicestershire have hit double figures in the space of one week this month [April 2022].

According to Public Health England data, there were 20 cases recorded in the week to 14 Apr [2022] across Leicester and Leicestershire. Eight of these alone were in Hinckley and Bosworth area.

These figures are no higher than in most areas nationwide currently. But with infections happening, it pays to know the signs to look out for.

Scarlet fever is caused by bacteria known as group A _Streptococcus_ (GAS). It is spread through close contact with people carrying the organism, often in the throat, or by touching objects and surfaces contaminated with the bacterium.

Cases occur all year round, but mainly in the spring. It was a common cause of childhood death in Victorian times. Even today, in rare cases, it can cause severe illnesses such as pneumonia, sepsis, and liver and kidney damage.

[Leicestershire is a county in the East Midlands, England, and takes its name from the city of Leicester located at its center and administered separately from the rest of the county; the county plus the city of Leicester has a total population of just over 1 million (2016 estimate), more than half of which lives in the Leicester Urban Area (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicestershire). A map showing the location of Leicestershire can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Leicestershire,+UK/@52.6849069,-1.1308291,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4877402d54957bb3:0x84398171f284af2b!8m2!3d52.772571!4d-1.2052126.

ProMED had posted multiple reports since 2013 on outbreaks of scarlet fever, a noninvasive form of group A _Streptococcus_ (GAS) disease and invasive GAS, throughout England and Wales (included in see alsos below).

One particular _emm_ type of GAS, _emm_1, had become increasingly common among isolates from both noninvasive and invasive GAS disease in England and Wales over the past several years. Whole-genome sequencing of _emm_1 identified an outbreak strain, called M1UK, that by 2016 accounted for about 84% of _emm_1 strains. M1UK was also found to produce 9 times more toxin responsible for the characteristic rash in scarlet fever (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(19)30446-3/fulltext).

Scarlet fever, caused by erythrogenic toxin-producing group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (_Streptococcus pyogenes_), usually follows streptococcal pharyngitis, but may also follow streptococcal infection of the skin or soft tissue, such as wounds, burns, the uterus (that is, puerperal scarlet fever), or the skin lesions of chickenpox. Scarlet fever typically affects children ages 5 to 15. By the age of 10 years, most people will have developed immunity to erythrogenic toxin.

Scarlet fever is highly contagious. Transmission occurs via airborne respiratory particles dispersed from infected patients by coughing or sneezing, usually in the colder winter months, or through contact with infected wounds or sores on the skin. It can rarely spread through contaminated food (http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJM196904242801702). Those who carry the bacteria in the nasopharynx or on the skin but have no symptoms are less contagious (https://phil.cdc.gov/Details.aspx?pid=10190).

Complications of scarlet fever include local spread of the streptococcal throat infection to involve regional lymph nodes, retropharyngeal tissues, middle ear, and sinuses, and immune-mediated diseases such as acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Septic complications due to spread of GAS in blood, such as meningitis, pyogenic arthritis, and endocarditis, occur rarely.

Over a century ago, scarlet fever was feared as a potentially lethal disease. Its mortality and morbidity waned, however, well before antibiotics became available. Since the advent of antibiotic therapy, the mortality rate of treated scarlet fever has been less than 1%.

The following is an abridged Public Health England report on group A streptococcal infections in England, 2021 to 2022, published 6 Apr 2022 (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/group-a-streptococcal-infections-activity-during-the-2021-to-2022-season/group-a-streptococcal-infections-report-on-seasonal-activity-in-england-2021-to-2022). The full report, including figures, table, and references, is available at the source URL:

"Scarlet fever surveillance is showing an increase in recent notification levels in line with usual seasonal pattern, also reflected in weekly GP consultation data. Notifications have been very low since March 2020, reflecting measures to curb transmission of SARS-CoV-2."

"The number of laboratory notifications of invasive group A streptococcal (iGAS) disease are below average compared to the past 4 seasons, but showing a usual seasonal increase."

"Scarlet fever
----------------
"After low levels of activity at the start of the season, scarlet fever notifications in England are increasing in line with the usual seasonal pattern (figure 1). A total of 3488 notifications of scarlet fever have been received to date this season in England (between [epidemiological or epi] week 37 of 2021 [12-18 Sep] and week 11 of 2022 [13-19 Mar] ) compared to an average of 8605 (range 787 to 15 466) for this same period in the previous 5 years.

"Weekly notification totals of 280 and 361 were recorded in the 2 most recent complete weeks (weeks 9 and 10 [27 Feb-12 Mar]). A provisional total of 333 notifications were made for week 11, with the potential for late reports to still be received.

"The last (2020 to 2021) season remained exceptionally low in numbers, with only 1791 notifications being recorded across the 12 months. This contrasts with prior seasons where higher numbers of notifications were recorded (30 768 in 2017 to 2018; 13 395 in 2018 to 2019; and 12 934 in 2019 to 2020).

"Scarlet fever notifications to date this season showed considerable variation across England, ranging between 1.5 (South West) and 12.4 (North West) per 100 000 population (Table 1). After the North West the highest observed rates were in North East (11.2), Yorkshire and the Humber (9.9), and the East Midlands (9.4) regions.

"The age distribution of scarlet fever cases notified so far for this season remains similar to previous years, with 89% being children under 10 years (median 4 years; range <1 year to 103 years).

"Invasive group A streptococcal infection [iGAS]
----------------------------------------------------
"So far this season (week 37 to 10 of the 2021 to 2022 season), there have been 505 notifications of iGAS disease reported through laboratory surveillance in England, lower than the average (1080) for the previous 5 years (range 780 to 1315: see figure 2).

"The total iGAS notifications recorded in the 2020 to 2021 season was exceptionally low at only 773, and the prior season (2019 to 2020) noted a large reduction midway through (decreasing 55% between weeks 12 and 16), coinciding with the 1st wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The total number of laboratory iGAS notifications recorded in the seasons since 2017 to 2018 showed successive decline, from 2875 in 2017to 2018, to 2234 in 2018 to 2019 and 1929 in 2019 to 2020 (figure 2).

"In the current season, the highest rates so far were reported in the North East region (1.7 per 100 000 population), followed by the Yorkshire and Humber (1.3 per 100,000) and North West (1.2 per 100,000) regions. All region except for the South West and London regions had higher rates compared to the same point last season.

"The median age of patients with iGAS infection so far this season is 53 years (range <1 year to 102 years), which is slightly lower than the range seen at this point in the preceding 4 seasons (56-57 years). Twelve percent of infections reported this season are in children (<10 years), which is within the normal range seen for the past 4 seasons (10%-14%, excluding the 2020 to 2021 season, which recorded only 4% in children).

"Analysis of reference laboratory iGAS isolate submissions indicate a diverse range of emm gene sequence types identified between January and March 2022. The results indicate the emm 89 are the most common (11% of referrals), followed by emm 108 (10%), emm 77 (9%), emm 1 and emm 12 (each 8%).

"During 2021, emm 89 was the most frequently identified (13%), followed by emm 108 (12%) then emm 66 (11%). This indicates that there has been a change in the dominant emm type and increase in the diversity in isolates being referred compared with what has been reported in pre-pandemic seasons.

"Antimicrobial susceptibility results from routine laboratory surveillance so far this season (September 2021 to February 2022) indicate erythromycin resistance in 17% of GAS sterile site isolates, higher than at the same point in the previous few seasons (7%-8%).

"An increase in tetracycline resistance has been noted this season (42%) compared to last season (40%); this continues an increasing trend in resistance over the last 5 seasons (13% at this point in the 2017 to 2018 season).

"Susceptibility testing of iGAS isolates against clindamycin demonstrated 14% resistance at this point in the season (compared with 10% last season), and isolates remained universally susceptible to penicillin.

"Discussion
------------
"The early part of the season remained low for scarlet fever notifications, compared with what was being reported pre-pandemic (2018 to 2019 season).

"A gradual increase in notifications and GP consultations for scarlet fever seen in recent weeks align with [what] would be expected at this point within the season, where peak activity typically occurs between weeks 11 and 15 (mid-March to mid-April). This contrasts with what was seen during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020 to 2021 season) where a slight increase was noted in the summer rather than the normal spring seasonal increase.

"These changes are most likely as a result of the measures implemented at that time to reduce transmission in schools and wider society, including limiting mixing and use of masks and other control measures, as well as the withdrawal of such measures (1).

"Prompt treatment of scarlet fever with antibiotics is recommended to reduce risk of possible complications and limit onward transmission. Renewed messaging to encourage contact with GP practices for patients with specific symptoms (for example, rash), should be considered. GPs and other frontline clinical staff are reminded of the increased risk of invasive disease among household contacts of scarlet fever cases (2, 3).

"The number of cases of iGAS disease notified through routine laboratory surveillance in England is slightly elevated compared with the same point last season (2020-2021), but lower than what was seen prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. There has been no notable increase in paediatric cases of iGAS; however, vigilance is warranted given the elevated levels of chickenpox co-circulating.

"Clinicians, microbiologists and HPTs should continue to be mindful of potential increases in invasive disease and maintain a high index of suspicion in relevant patients as early recognition and prompt initiation of specific and supportive therapy for patients with iGAS infection can be life-saving.

"Invasive disease isolates and superficial isolates from suspected clusters or outbreaks should be submitted to:
