Death of goats due to consumption of nitrate dissolved water: TNPCB
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The result of a study conducted by Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board
(TNPCB) has attributed mass mortality of goats at Kunnathur [near
Tirupur] during last month to consumption of nitrate dissolved water.
The incident occurred on 21 Sep 2009 when about 180 goats were killed
under mysterious circumstances.

Official sources told The Hindu on Tuesday [20 Oct 2009] that the
water samples taken from the area was 1st analysed by the District
Environmental Laboratory of TNPCB in Tirupur and its findings had
been concurred by the Advanced Environmental Laboratory of the Board
in Chennai a few days ago.

The report indicated that the samples contained nitrates much higher
than the permissible levels of 45 milligram per litre of water.

According to the sources, salts containing high nitrate content have
flowed into the open from an industrial unit situated in the region
during the rain through the storm water drain.

Official sources said that the nitrate-containing water went into the
rumen of the animals and got combined with hemoglobin in the red
blood cells to form methemoglobin.

"Since methemoglobin cannot transport oxygen efficiently to the
animal tissues, it created nitrate toxicity causing death of goats,"
TNPCB sources said.

[Nitrate can be a toxic portion of the water. However, to kill the
goats the nitrate level would need to be at least between 400 and 800
parts per million (mg per liter) of water. The article does not
provide the nitrate level of the water believed to have been consumed
by the goats. While water can contain this high a level, it may be
more likely that the forage was high in nitrates as forages can reach
these levels and much higher, much easier than water. - Mod.TG]
