Coconino County Health officials are confirming a case of the [a] Hantavirus [infection] in Northern Arizona. Officials say the case involves someone who traveled to Coconino County from outside Arizona. The person went to many places in the area and it is unknown where the person contracted the virus.

The Hantaviruses [are] transmitted to people who come in contact, or breathe infected urine, droppings or saliva from wild mice. This is the 1st confirmed case of the [a] Hantavirus [infection] in Coconino County this year [2017] and the 6th case in the county since 2007. Symptoms of the virus [infection] could include fever, headache and muscle aches. Those symptoms progress to severe difficulty in breathing. If anyone has those symptoms, contact their doctor immediately.

[This report does not indicate if the affected individual was present in Coconino county for a brief time or for several days longer than the usual incubation period as a clue to the possible location where the infection was acquired. Sporadic cases of hantavirus infections occur annually across the western USA including occasionally in Arizona. The hantavirus involved in this, and other cases in the western USA, is Sin Nombre virus. Fatalities are due to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS). HPS can be very serious, and patients developing the symptoms should seek medical attention at the earliest possible time. As the above report notes, there is no information about the circumstances nor the location under which this infection was acquired.

Infected rodents shed the virus in feces, urine and saliva. Individuals opening up cabins or storage areas that have been closed over winter or cleaning areas with signs of rodent presence should heed the precautions that the CDC recommends in order to avoid exposure to the virus (https://www.cdc.gov/rodents/cleaning/index.html).

Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are the reservoir hosts of the virus. An image of the deer mouse, _P. maniculatus_, can be seen at http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg and in the report at the above URL. - Mod.TY
