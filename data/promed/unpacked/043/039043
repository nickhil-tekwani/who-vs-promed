[Re the possibility that the West Nile-like virus was brought into the USA
by birds smuggled from Africa
*******************
"... we were seeing large numbers of African birds being smuggled out of
their homelands and 'laundered' through other countries for exportation to
the United States."
"Smuggled birds represent a significant health threat to native birds,
poultry, and people. Wild-caught parrots may carry two very contagious avian
diseases: psittacosis and exotic Newcastle disease, both of which can also
infect humans."
"Federal regulations require that all imported wild birds spend 30 days in
government-approved quarantine stations after they arrive in [the USA.
Smuggled birds bypass this vital health screening."

Federal Agents Target Illegal Bird Trade
----------------------------------------
The successsful break-up of an international smuggling ring dealing in
protected birds and other wildlife was announced today [4 June 1998 by the
U.S. Customs Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
The 3-year investigation, code-named Operation Jungle Trade, spotlights this
country's continuing pursuit of those who traffic in wild-caught birds --
species
whose plight is a major international conservation concern.
Operation Jungle Trade, which culminated yesterday with the execution of
Federal arrest and search-and-seizure warrants in Colorado, Missouri,
Tennessee, and Texas, produced 40 arrests and/or indictments and the seizure
of more than 660 exotic birds and other animals, most of them native Mexican
species that can only be exported from that country with appropriate
authorizing documents. Trade in many of these species is controlled under
the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna
and Flora (CITES), a global agreement that regulates the
importation and exportation of hundreds of animals and plants.
The smuggling ring, which operated across the U.S.-Mexico border, extended
into 9 states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and 10 other countries:
Australia, Belize, Brazil, Costa Rica, Egypt, Ghana, Honduras, New Zealand,
Panama, and South Africa.
The illegal wildlife trade is a multi-billion-dollar-a-year global
"business" that
threatens the future viability of the world's wildlife. Wild-caught birds,
including
parrots and macaws, are a prime target for this black market. Many species
are
highly prized by collectors and other people who seek exotic pets, making
them
highly profitable commodities for wildlife smugglers.
"We successfully targeted a portion of this trade with a major multi-year
international probe earlier in the decade," Clark said. "At that time, we
were seeing large numbers of African birds being smuggled out of their
homelands and 'laundered' through other countries for exportation to the
United States. Now traffic in Latin American species is a growing concern,
with much of it coming across our southern border."
"The United States is the world's largest market for wildlife and wildlife
products, but this demand cannot be met at the expense of the world's animal
and plant species," Clark said. "Operation Jungle Trade shows that the
commercial exploitation of wild birds and other protected animals will not
be tolerated."
The Wild Bird Trade . . .
DID YOU KNOW?
* The illegal wildlife trade is a highly lucrative black market that many
believe
ranks second in profits only to illegal drug traffic.
* Wild birds are a major target for wildlife profiteers.
* Because the pet trade was taking such a toll on many wild bird populations
worldwide, Congress passed the Wild Bird Conservation Act in 1992 to further
restrict trade in protected species. The Act prohibits the commercial
importation
of parrots and other CITES-listed birds unless they come from countries with
approved species management and conservation programs or approved
captive-breeding facilities, or belong to certain approved captive-bred
species.
* Before passage of this law, the United States was a major importer of
parrots
and other CITES-listed birds. According to the World Wildlife Fund, some
150,000 psittacines entered the country through *legal* trade channels in
1990.
Even with that volume of imports, smuggled birds were also believed to be
meeting a significant portion of consumer demand for these pets.
* "Bird laundering" was a common practice among wildlife smugglers earlier
in the decade and continues to be a problem for psittacine species today.
Birds are
smuggled out of countries where they are protected and into countries where
fewer restrictions exist. Export documents are secured in the second country
so
that the "laundered" birds can then be "legally" transported to other
nations.
* Many smuggled birds never make it to the marketplace. Significant
mortality rates are common even in the legal trade and birds in the hands of
smugglers often suffer a similar fate.
* Smuggled birds also represent a significant health threat to native birds,
poultry, and people. Wild-caught parrots may carry two very contagious avian
diseases: psittacosis and exotic Newcastle disease, both of which can also
infect humans.
* Federal regulations require that all imported wild birds spend 30 days in
government-approved quarantine stations after they arrive in this country.
Smuggled birds bypass this vital health screening.
