Warning on Sabah Red Tide
---------------------------
The ban on the importation of fish and shellfish from East Malaysia remains
in place as the coastal waters of Sabah, particularly Kuala Penyu area, are
still contaminated with Red Tide toxin, the Department of Fisheries,
Ministry of Industry and Primary Resources said yesterday.
Waters of Brunei Darussalam remain free of red tide, it added. As an added
precaution, the public is advised to completely remove the guts, gills and
other internal organs of fish before cooking. It is also advised to abstain
from consuming plankton-eating fish like mackerel and sardines, and
shellfish like clams, cockles and mussels of unknown origin.
