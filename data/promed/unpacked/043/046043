From: Sarah Brice <sbrice@aol.com>

My question concerning this outbreak is: Did the Salmonella - D come from
the original beef, or was it passed on by the butcher in question? Wouldn't
cooking the meat properly kill the bacteria, or is this some superstrain
that does not die under high heat exposure?
My experience in the UK is that meat is always cooked until it is well done
(i.e. no pink); however, the presentation and storage in "butcher shops" is
not always under the most healthy conditions (stored in unrefrigerated
cases all day, and in some cases, sitting in windows with direct sunlight).
Does anyone know if the butcher in question came down with Salmonella - D
himself?
