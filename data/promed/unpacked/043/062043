The Ministry of Health (MoH) says it has detected polio virus type 2 in the environment in Tamale in the Northern region of Ghana, which constitutes a public health emergency. Consequently, the ministry has detailed field investigations to identify a possible source of infection and determine the extent of geographic spread.

In a statement signed and issued by the chief director of the ministry on [Wed 10 Jul 2019], the MoH explained that the virus was detected through a routine surveillance in collaboration with the Ghana Health Service (GHS) and confirmed by the Noguchi Memorial Institute of Medical and Research Centre (NMIMR).

This, the ministry said, constitutes a public health emergency.

[According to another media report, "The type 2 strain of the polio virus was confirmed earlier this week by the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research (NMIMR) to be similar to the type that broke out in Nigeria recently" (https://www.graphic.com.gh/news/general-news/polio-resurfaces-in-tamale.html).

If confirmed to be genetically related to one of the cVDPV2s currently circulating in Nigeria, this will be further "evidence" of the widespread reach of the cVDPV outbreaks in Nigeria and the impact on other countries in Africa (and potentially outside of Africa) as seen back in 2004.

Tamale is located in the Northern region of Ghana, not sharing international borders with other countries. A map of Ghana showing administrative divisions can be found at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/ghana_map.htm.

Poliovirus weekly update, 10 Jul 2019, WHO
-----------------------
New wild poliovirus reported this week:
AFP cases: 9
Environment: 3

New cVDPV poliovirus reported this week:
AFP cases: 2
Environment: 1
Others: 1

Headlines
- A circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been confirmed in China. It is genetically linked to a VDPV2 isolated from an environmental sample from Xinjiang province, collected on [18 Apr 2018]. WHO is continuing to evaluate the situation and stands ready to support the ongoing investigation and risk assessment by national authorities.

Summary of new viruses this week:
- Pakistan: 9 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases and 3 WPV1-positive environmental samples;
- Angola: 1 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) case; and
- China: 1 cVDPV2 case.

Afghanistan
- No wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases have been reported in the past week. There are 10 WPV1 cases reported in 2019 from Afghanistan. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2018 remains 21.
- No WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week.

Pakistan
- 9 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases have been confirmed: 1 each from Jaffarabad and Killa Abdullah districts, Balochistan province, with onset of paralysis on 28 May [2019] and [9 Jun 2019]; 5 from Bannu district with onset of paralysis on [9, 11, 14, 16, and 20 Jun 2019]; and 2 from Torghar district with onset of paralysis on [13 and 17 Jun 2019], Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The total number of WPV1 cases are 41. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 remains 12.
- 3 WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week: 1 each from Gadap Town and Gulshan-e-Iqbal in Karachi district, Sindh province; and 1 from Lahore district, Punjab province. The samples were collected between [18-19 Jun 2019].

Nigeria
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 has been reported in the past week. There are 9 cVDPV2 cases reported in 2019 so far. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 remains 34.
- No positive environmental samples were reported in the past week.
- Recent confirmation of spread of 1 of the cVDPV2 outbreaks, both within Nigeria and internationally, underscores the urgent need to fill remaining vaccination gaps in the ongoing outbreak response, and to optimize the geographic extent and operational quality of mOPV2 [monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2] response.

Lake Chad basin
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported in the past week.
- In the Lake Chad region, cVDPV2 linked to the outbreak originating in Nigeria has been detected in Niger (1 case in 2019 and 10 cases in 2018) and Cameroon (1 positive environmental sample, collected on [20 Apr 2019] in Extreme Nord).
- The risk of further cVDPV2 spread across the Lake Chad subregion remains high.

Central Africa
Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo):
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo) There are 6 reported cases of cVDPV2 in 2019. The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported in 2018 is 20. DRC is currently affected by 6 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, in the provinces of Haut Katanga; Mongala; Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri; Sankuru; and Kasai (2).

Angola:
- 1 case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported this week in Angola in Kuvango district, Huila province, on 30 May 2019.
- This is the 2nd cVDPV2 outbreak in Angola this year [2019]; the earlier outbreak was detected in Lunda Norte province, for which an outbreak response is in progress (in close coordination with DRC).
- The Ministry of Health and local health authorities are undertaking a detailed investigation, and the partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) are providing support as required. A full epidemiological and virological field investigation is ongoing, including to ascertain the source and origin of the isolated virus; active surveillance is being strengthened; subnational population immunity levels are being analysed; and outbreak response is being planned.
- Given cross-border population movements, subnational immunity, and surveillance gaps, Lunda Norte province is considered at high risk for further transmission of the isolated cVDPV2. It is critical that an emergency, preventive outbreak response now be fully implemented in the province. In absence of a timely and high-quality vaccination response, there is imminent risk of further transmission of this cVDPV2, potentially leading to a significant outbreak of paralytic polio. Two preventive emergency outbreak response campaigns with mOPV2 are planned in Lunda Norte province, to be synchronized with campaigns in neighboring areas of DR Congo, to interrupt any potential cross-border circulation.

Horn of Africa
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported in the Horn of Africa.
- The current outbreak is linked to an ongoing cVDPV2 outbreak detected in the Horn of Africa in 2018, with cases reported in Somalia as well as from an environmental sample in Kenya. Separately, Somalia is also affected by a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3) outbreak.
- Somalia has reported a total of 15 cVDPV cases (8 type 2, 6 type 3, and 1 coinfection of both type 2 and type 3) since the beginning of the outbreaks. The most recent cVDPV3 virus was from an AFP case from Runingod district, Middle Shabelle province, with an onset date of paralysis on [7 Sep 2018]. Circulating VDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in 1 environmental sample in Kenya collected on [21 Mar 2018]. There is also 1 reported case of cVDPV2 in Ethiopia, linked to Somalia, with onset on 20 May 2019.

Papua New Guinea
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 remains 26.
- The most recent cVDPV1 virus was isolated from an environmental sample collected in the National Capital district on [6 Nov 2018].
- A GPEI outbreak response assessment reviewed the impact of current outbreak response and concluded that overall strong response had been implemented. Commending national and subnational public health authorities and health workers on their efforts, the assessment team underscored the need on now filling any residual subnational surveillance and immunity gaps.
- The team reviewed all aspects of the response and noted significant efforts and improvements, including on service delivery, surveillance strengthening, data analysis, cold chain/reverse cold chain refurbishment, vaccine acceptance and community engagement, health worker engagement, collaboration with neighboring Indonesia, and outreach to remote areas/communities. In particular, the group noted the strong collaboration between outbreak response and strengthening of routine immunization, including through systematic collaboration with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and highlighted that this model of working should be replicated in other outbreak settings.

Mozambique
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreak has been reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 remains 1.
- In addition to the confirmed case, the same virus was also isolated from 2 healthy community contacts, reported on [10 and 17 Dec 2018].
- The GPEI and partners are working with country counterparts to support the local public health authorities in conducting a field investigation (clinical, epidemiological, and immunological) and thorough risk assessment to discuss planning and implementation of immunization and outbreak response.

Indonesia
- No circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) cases were reported this week.
- In total, 3 genetically linked circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) isolates were detected from Papua province: a cVDPV1 from an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case, with onset of paralysis on [27 Nov 2018], and 2 cVDPV1 isolates from healthy community contacts, collected on [24 Jan 2019] and [13 Feb 2019]. This outbreak is not linked to the cVDPV1 currently affecting neighboring Papua New Guinea.
- The 2nd polio immunization response round has been extended in Papua province to give the opportunity for districts to vaccinate and protect more children. Lessons learnt from the special operations being deployed in Yahukimo district, the epi-centre of the outbreak, have been shared with other high-risk districts with hard-to-reach populations. These districts attended a meeting in Jayapura on [21 Jun 2019] chaired by the Papua Provincial Health Office (PHO). The meeting has re-energized local health authorities who have signed a declaration of commitment to increase coverage and release local funds to support enhanced operations.
- To support these districts in the coming weeks, PHO, WHO, UNICEF, and PAEI have developed a joint monitoring plan with senior consultants and staff identified and tasked to provide direct support to each district. A health centre analysis of Puskesmas with the largest numbers of unvaccinated children is being used to target this additional support most efficiently, ensuring as well that functional cold-chain equipment is in place.
- The Coordinating Ministry for Human Development and Cultural Affairs met [27 Jun 2019] in Jakarta with the Ministry of Health, the Home Affairs Ministry, the President's Office, military and police representatives, WHO, UNICEF, ITAGI, and other stakeholders to discuss progress towards implementing Indonesia's polio outbreak response. A number of important recommendations have been agreed upon, which will help address remaining bottlenecks and widen support for quality operations.

Iran
- In total, 3 WPV1-positive environmental samples have been reported in 2019, all from Sistan and Balochistan province. The isolated viruses have been detected in environmental samples only, and genetic sequencing confirms they are linked to WPV1 circulating in Karachi, Pakistan.
- The Ministry of Health and local health authorities are undertaking a detailed investigation, and the partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) are on standby to provide support as required. An immediate risk assessment suggests that this event has limited public health implications, given Iran's very high levels of routine immunization coverage and strong disease surveillance. However, this event further underlines the risk of international spread of WPV1 from Pakistan/Afghanistan.

China
- A circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been confirmed in China. The virus was isolated from stool specimens of an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case from Liangshan Yi Autonomous prefecture, Sichuan province, with onset of paralysis on [25 Apr 2019], and is genetically linked to a VDPV2 isolated from an environmental sample from Xinjiang province, collected on [18 Apr 2018]. More information will be shared as it becomes available.
- China continues to maintain strong routine immunization coverage, with both IPV and bivalent OPV reaching more than 95% nationwide, and strong poliovirus surveillance including through environmental surveillance.

[The global total number of WPV1-associated AFP cases reported since 1 Jan 2019 is now officially at 51, with 41 cases reported from Pakistan and 10 reported from Afghanistan. The positive WPV1 environmental samples found in Iran, while not viewed as a global threat, are a reminder that the WPV1 is travelling outside of Pakistan and Afghanistan, and if it should arrive in an area with pockets of non-vaccinated individuals, the situation will be ripe for having outbreaks of WPV1 out of the 3 identified endemic countries (Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan).

Perusing the media reports, there are areas around the world vocalizing concern regarding polio as their vaccination coverages have been falling. See "Polio fears as vaccination rates plunge across southeast Queensland [Australia]" (https://thewest.com.au/news/qld/polio-fears-as-vaccination-rates-plunge-across-southeast-queensland-ng-fb4c1b624084806423954fbeec6bdf98) and "Vaccination rates for babies in Surrey 'well below safe levels'" (https://www.eagleradio.co.uk/news/local-news/2912218/vaccination-rates-for-babies-in-surrey-well-below-safe-levels/).

There are now 15 countries (including China, and 16 if one includes Ghana) that have had documentation of poliovirus circulation in the past 12 months either through positive AFP cases or positive environmental samples. See section [3] below for a discussion on the impact and possible outcomes. Please read section [3] below for an interpretation of the impact and ramifications of this.

[3] Polio eradication challenges - Science Magazine

[doi:10.1126/science.aay6925]

The global initiative to eradicate polio is badly stuck, battling the virus on 2 fronts. New figures show the wild poliovirus remains entrenched in Afghanistan and in Pakistan, its other holdout, where cases are surging. In Africa, meanwhile, the vaccine itself is spawning virulent strains. The leaders of the world's biggest public health program are now admitting that success is not just around the corner and are intensively debating how to break the impasse.

"The biggest problem for me for a long time was recognizing that we truly have a problem, and business as usual will not get us to the finish line," says Roland Sutter, who leads polio research at the World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva, Switzerland, where the polio eradication effort is based.

"The rose-tinted glasses are off," adds longtime program spokesperson Oliver Rosenbauer of WHO. "Now, really tough questions are openly being asked, questions that even 12 months ago no one asked."

The program, which has spent USD 16 billion over 30 years, had planned to eradicate polio from Pakistan and Afghanistan this year [2019] (only the latest of many deadlines). Instead, almost 4 times as many cases have occurred there so far this year [2019] than in the same period in 2018. At 51, the total number of cases may still seem low, but only about one in every 200 people infected with the virus develops paralysis, meaning thousands have been infected. The virus is circulating widely: a strain from Karachi, Pakistan, has popped up in Iran. Adding to the worries, the spike occurred in the low season, when viral transmission subsides, a harbinger of worse to come in the 2nd half of the year [2019].

Pakistan and Afghanistan are considered one epidemiologic block, with the virus flowing freely across the border. The main problem in both countries is that the massive vaccination campaigns held every few months are still not reaching every child.

In Pakistan, national elections in July 2018 distracted government officials, and the quality of the vaccination campaigns slipped. Meanwhile, the poor, neglected communities where the polio virus lurks are increasingly refusing the vaccine. Lacking running water, sanitation, and basic health services, people face far more immediate health threats than the now-slim chance of contracting polio, and they don't understand why vaccinators arrive with only polio drops. Since the government began several years ago to jail parents who do not comply, the opposition has gone underground, with parents hiding their children or using fake finger markings to pretend they have been vaccinated.

Still no end in sight
Polio cases caused by the wild virus, which is still circulating in Afghanistan and Pakistan, are up compared with the same period last year [2018]. Meanwhile, vaccine-derived outbreaks pose a continuing problem, primarily in Africa. [There is an excellent map showing the locations of cases/isolates during 2018-2019 at the source URL. - Mod.MPP]

Exacerbating the situation is a vitriolic disinformation campaign on social media, says virologist Mark Pallansch of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, one of the partner agencies in the initiative. Deadly attacks on polio vaccinators and their police escorts are on the rise. Still, if Pakistan's government makes eradication a national priority and puts money behind it, Sutter says, "There is a fighting chance" of success.

In Afghanistan, ongoing conflict has kept vaccinators out of broad swaths of the country. The Taliban has banned polio vaccination in some places; in others, local leaders have prohibited door-to-door polio drives. One of their concerns is that outsiders might gather information that could enable the United States to target drone strikes, some in the program say. "Polio eradication is collateral damage to the peace talks," says WHO's Michel Zaffran, who heads the global initiative. Afghanistan has not yet seen a spike in cases this year [2019], but one is inevitable if vaccinators can't reach large numbers of children, says WHO's Chris Maher, who has been leading eradication operations in the region. Still, the program has dealt with conflict before, says Jay Wenger of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in Seattle, Washington, another partner in the eradication effort: "In Syria and Nigeria we found ways to get good enough vaccine coverage to stop the virus."

In Africa, the wild poliovirus appears to be gone, but the vaccine-derived viruses circulating there are just as dangerous. These strains arise when the weakened live virus used in the oral polio vaccine (OPV) mutates and regains its virulence. In rare instances, where a population's immunity is low, they can spread just like the wild virus. Last year [2018], vaccine-derived viruses paralyzed 105 children worldwide; the wild virus just 33.

To prevent outbreaks of vaccine-derived virus, WHO has declared that once the wild virus is gone, countries must stop all use of OPV. As a 1st step, in April 2016 all countries switched from the trivalent version of OPV -- which covers all 3 types of polio virus -- to a bivalent one, which lacks the type 2 component. (Wild type 2 virus is the only one that has been eradicated.)

The program's scientific advisers knew some vaccine-derived type 2 virus would linger in the 1st few years after the switch, sparking outbreaks. But modeling suggested the program could quickly squelch them -- without starting new ones -- with the judicious use of a new live vaccine, monovalent OPV2 (mOPV2), which is effective against only type 2. It's akin to fighting fire with fire; the gamble was that mOPV2 would not spawn new outbreaks of its own. (An alternative exists, the killed or inactivated polio vaccine, which can't revert but simply isn't powerful enough to quash an outbreak.)

The switch worked, except in Africa, where type 2 vaccine-derived outbreaks have been more frequent and much harder to stop than the models projected; they are now smoldering in 7 countries. By using mOPV2, "We have now created more new emergences of the virus than we have stopped," Pallansch says. In Nigeria, where 43 cases have been detected since 2018, type 2 virus has spread from the north to the densely populated port city of Lagos; it has also entered neighboring Niger. The Democratic Republic of the Congo has seen 26 cases. And the situation is deteriorating, a key WHO committee concluded on 29 May [2019].

Meanwhile, the program has already used nearly 260 million doses of mOPV2. "We are down to less than 10 million doses for the whole planet, and that is not enough," says Pallansch, who chairs a committee advising WHO's director-general on the vaccine's use. "No one thought it was possible that we would use that amount." And as a result of the 2016 vaccine switch, an increasing number of children lack immunity to the type 2 virus, setting the stage for an explosive outbreak. That puts the program in a bind. "We have no choice but to keep using" the monovalent vaccine, Zaffran says. "It is all we've got. We have to live with the risk until we have a technical solution."

Two are on the horizon. A novel OPV2, genetically engineered to reduce its chances of reversion dramatically, has passed a phase I clinical trial, supported by the Gates Foundation. "It looks as good as it can now," Wenger says. The earliest it could possibly be available for use, however, is 2020. Further out is a new inactivated vaccine powerful enough to end outbreaks. "The race is on," Sutter says, "and it is very hard for me to predict which will win."

Nor will he predict when polio will be gone for good. Optimistic projections, he says, are "just setting the program up for failure."

[The above article is an excellent discussion on what has been going on. Unfortunately, I am not as confident that the WPV1 is no longer circulating in Africa. There are still areas in northern Nigeria with extreme civil unrest, and where there exist pockets of unvaccinated individuals. In 2016, there was an outbreak of WPV1 identified in Borno state, with a virus that was genetically related to a virus that was last identified as circulating in 2011. Interpretation: a below-the-radarscope circulation of the WPV1 continued in the northern state of Nigeria. Further confirmation of the existing pockets of susceptibles in northern Nigeria is currently seen by the multiple outbreaks of cVDPV2 in Nigeria, a sign of pockets of susceptibles.

And the number of countries with documented circulation of VDPVs continues to grow this year (2019), signaling the impact of decreasing vaccination coverages in multiple countries. When we 1st launched the polio eradication effort in the Americas region in 1985, it was a simpler time, with warring factions that put down their arms to permit national and subnational vaccination campaigns to interrupt transmission of the WPV in their countries, with the last case of WPV confirmed in 1991 in Peru. The world political scene has markedly changed since then, and children's health is now being held hostage to political gains: a very sorry state of affairs. In addition, there has been an explosion of anti-vaccination information using social media, so that areas without civil unrest are refusing vaccinations of children based on erroneous information, adding to the sorry state of affairs. - Mod.MPP]
