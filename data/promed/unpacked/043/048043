Large number of dead carp reported at Kensington Metropark
----------------------------------------------------------
A large number of carp have died at Kent Lake in Kensington
Metropark. Kensington is part of the Huron-Clinton Metropark system
and park patrons and local listeners have reported seeing large
numbers of dead carp floating in the water and all over the shores.

Officials tell WHMI that they are working with the Michigan
Department of Natural Resources on the issue. Communication specialist
Denise Semion says the fish kill could be from spawning stress and a
rapid rise in water temperature or from other causes, such as a virus
that affects mostly carp. Semion says they will be meeting with the
DNR and will provide more information once that happens but in the
meantime, visitors may see dead carp in the lake.

[The summer temperatures have caused the water temperatures to rise
above the comfort level of fish that are stressed due to spawning.

Koi herpesvirus (KHV), also known as cyprinid herpesvirus-3 or
CyHV-3, is a highly contagious viral disease capable of causing
significant morbidity and mortality in common carp (_Cyprinus
carpio_). In many countries, the common carp is a food fish and also
has been selectively bred for the ornamental fish industry, where it
is known as koi.

The most significant sign of KHV is the sudden appearance of mass
mortality within 1 and 2 days of initial infection. Aside from mass
mortality, the other common signs are white patches or necrosis of the
gills. Other clinical signs are sunken eyes, bleeding gills, and
secondary bacterial infection or parasite infestation.

The article does not provide much information, with the exception
that carp seem to be the only species involved. A necropsy of some
fish with appropriate laboratory testing would help determine the
cause of the dead carp. - Mod.TG
