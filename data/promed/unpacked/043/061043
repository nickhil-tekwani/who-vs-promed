Tamaulipas state, on the west coast of Mexico and bordering Texas has reported 3407 typhoid fever infections since the beginning of 2021, according to a Expreso.press report Friday [24 Sep 2021]. This puts Tamaulipas at the top of cases reported in any one state, closely followed by Sinaloa state (3381).

Typhoid fever, caused by the bacterium [_Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi], is a life-threatening bacterial infection. Typhoid fever is still common in the developing world, where it affects about 21 million people annually. _S._ Typhi lives only in humans. Persons with typhoid fever can have the organism in their bloodstream as well as intestinal tract. In addition, a small number of persons, called carriers, recover from typhoid fever but continue to carry the bacterium. Both ill persons and carriers shed _S._ Typhi in their feces.

You can get typhoid fever if you eat food or drink beverages that have been handled by a person who is shedding _S._ Typhi or if sewage contaminated with the bacterium gets into the water you use for drinking or washing food. Therefore, typhoid fever is more common in areas of the world where handwashing is less frequent and water is likely to be contaminated with sewage.

[The primary report (https://expreso.press/2021/09/24/afecta-a-tamaulipecos-casos-de-tifoidea/; in Spanish) does not enumerate the number of illnesses in other states.

Typhoid fever, so-called enteric fever, caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi, has a totally different presentation from that of the commoner kinds of salmonellosis.

Epidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the more commonly seen types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive. The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louse-borne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas, typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus.

The classic food-related cluster of _S. enterica_ serotype Typhi in the USA occurred related to a summer house in the (still) wealthy suburb of New York City of Oyster Bay, Long Island, in August 1906. This was the still infamous cluster associated with Mary Mallon, "Typhoid Mary," an Irish immigrant who was both a food preparer and a typhoid bacillus carrier.

Some strains of the organism have become quite antimicrobial resistant, particularly ones linked to Pakistan (refer to the 'See Also' section below). - Mod.LL
