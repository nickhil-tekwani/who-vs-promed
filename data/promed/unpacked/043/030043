Investigation of a New Diagnosis of Multidrug-Resistant, Dual-Tropic
HIV-1 Infection, New York City, 2005
-----------------------------------------------
In December 2004, infection with a strain of multidrug-resistant
(MDR), dual-tropic [virus with capacity to use both CCR5 and CXCR4
co-receptors for attachment and entry into CD4 lymphocytes - Mod.CP]
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 was newly diagnosed in a man
aged 46 years in New York City (NYC). The man (i.e., the index
patient) had no history of antiretroviral treatment and reported
having sex with multiple named and anonymous male partners, using
crystal methamphetamine, and engaging in unprotected insertive and
receptive anal intercourse. He had rapid progression to acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) after experiencing signs and
symptoms of acute HIV infection. The case was reported to the New
York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYCDOH) in late
January 2005 and has been described previously (1).
This report describes the public health investigation of the index
patient's reported contacts and a review of viral genetic sequencing
(genotype) results from other HIV-infected patients in the NYC region
to estimate the prevalence of this strain of HIV. The investigation,
conducted by NYCDOH, Connecticut Department of Public Health, Aaron
Diamond AIDS Research Center, New York State Department of Health,
and CDC, identified 3 other patients with similar risk factors who
engaged in high-risk sexual activity at the same time and in the same
venues as the index patient and who were infected with a
genotypically homologous strain of HIV. The findings demonstrate the
usefulness of population-based reporting of HIV genotyping data to
identify exact matches of new HIV mutations associated with drug
resistance and to determine their characteristics and public health
importance. The findings also demonstrate the continued risk for HIV
transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM) through high-risk
behaviors and the need to find effective methods to prevent HIV
transmission in this population.
Case Report
---------
The index patient had tested negative for HIV infection in May 2003
and reported no history of treatment with antiretroviral drugs
(ARVs). In early November 2004, he experienced onset of persistent
fever, fatigue, and pharyngitis. In mid-December 2004, he tested
positive for HIV-1 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and
Western blot. The patient's HIV infection progressed rapidly to AIDS
during a period of 4 to 20 months (1); his exact date of infection
was unknown. His CD4 T lymphocyte count decreased from 80 cells/uL on
29 Dec 2004, to 28 cells/uL on 19 Jan 2005. His plasma HIV RNA levels
ranged from 100 000 to 650 000 copies/mL during January 2005 (2).
Genotypic analysis of the viral polymerase (pol) gene predicted that
the patient's virus was resistant to most agents in 3 classes of
ARVs: nucleoside or nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase
inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and
protease inhibitors. Phenotypic drug-resistance testing indicated
that the strain was susceptible to enfuvirtide and efavirenz. The
virus was subtype B; the viral population was relatively homogeneous,
with an average intrasample diversity for the p17 and V3 regions
ranging from 0.4 percent to 1.7 percent. The virus was dual tropic
and had replication capacity 36 percent greater than wild-type HIV
strains. The patient tested negative for all known genetic
host-susceptibility factors associated with rapid AIDS progression
(e.g., presence of D32 homo- or heterozygosity, HLA A-B-C
homozygosity, or specific Class I and Class II alleles) (2,3).
Contact Investigation
-----------------
After the case was reported to NYCDOH, the index patient provided the
names and contact information for 14 sex partners during a standard,
voluntary, confidential interview. The named partners were contacted
by NYCDOH in February 2005 and were offered HIV testing. Ten of the
14 named partners had been reported previously to the NYCDOH HIV/AIDS
registry as seropositive. Eight of these 10 partners either had a
recent blood test for HIV genotype (i.e., within one year of the
index diagnosis) or consented to a new blood draw for genotyping.
Chart review indicated that all 10 named partners were clinically
stable, and none had a genotype matching that of the index patient.
Of the 4 partners who had not been previously reported to NYCDOH, one
could not be reached despite multiple attempts; the 3 others all
either reported a recent negative HIV test or refused testing.
Laboratory Reporting
----------------
In response to this case, on 11 Feb 2005, NYCDOH requested that all
physicians and laboratories in NYC report patients with newly
diagnosed MDR HIV-1 and rapidly progressive disease. Laboratories
conducting genotypic drug-resistance testing were asked to report all
genotypes identified during the period 1 Jun 2005 to 3 Jun 2005 that
exhibited resistance to 4 or more nucleoside/nucleotide analogue
reverse transcriptase inhibitors, one or more non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors, or 4 or more protease inhibitors. In
response, laboratories reported 189 MDR genotypes, representing 134
persons, of whom 121 had medical records available for review in NYC.
An attempt to match each person to those in the HIV/AIDS registry
confirmed that 116 persons had diagnoses of HIV infection before 1
Jan 2000; 5 had infections diagnosed during 2000-2004. Two of these
patients (with infections diagnosed in 2001 and 2003, respectively)
had no record of ARV therapy in their charts; 2 others were on ARV
therapy before the MDR HIV-1 genotype was identified in the index
patient in December 2004.
During the period 11 Feb to 30 Jun 2005, health-care providers were
encouraged to perform genotyping on all patients who tested newly HIV
positive and to report by telephone any patients with newly diagnosed
MDR HIV-1 infection who had never been treated with ARVs.
In the period February-March 2005, the 28 laboratories conducting HIV
genotyping on NYC residents were asked to match the pol genotype of
the index patient against the nucleotide sequences in their sequence
databases. The index patient's pol genotype also was matched against
sequence libraries at CDC, the New York State Department of Health
Wadsworth Center, 3 large commercial laboratories in the United
States, 2 laboratories in Canada, and one in Europe. Three male
patients, one in Connecticut and 2 in NYC, had nucleotide sequences
with >95 percent homology to the index patient's pol sequence. The 3
patients with matching genotypes were interviewed either by their
primary-care providers or by NYCDOH. Information from the interviews
indicated a strong likelihood that the index patient and Connecticut
patient had been sex partners. Although none of the 3 patients with
matching genotypes identified each other or the index patient by
name, all reported engaging in sexual activity at the same events or
venues or at similar events attended by the index patient during the
preceding 2 years. Both the Connecticut patient and the index patient
described a sex partner attending at least one of these events who
resembled the other in terms of general appearance, occupation, and
serostatus (self-reported). All 3 men with genotypes that matched the
index patient's genotype were clinically stable on ARV regimens at
the time of their interviews. Sufficient data were not available to
determine the rate of disease progression before diagnosis of HIV
infection or initiation of ARV therapy in any of the 3 patients with
matching genotypes.
Sequencing
--------
Confirmatory sequencing of pol and additional portions of the genome
was conducted by 3 independent laboratories on new blood samples from
the index patient and the 3 patients with matching genotypes. This
testing confirmed the pol homology of the viruses and homology of
other genomic regions. However, because of the incomplete
epidemiologic information, a definite chain of transmission among
these 4 genotypically related cases could not be established.

MMWR Editorial Note
-------------------
This report describes the public health investigation surrounding a
previously reported case of MDR HIV-1 infection (1). The
investigation was conducted to identify contacts of the index
patient, to offer HIV testing and partner notification, and to search
for other persons with diagnosed HIV infection who shared the index
patient's HIV genotype. Data obtained from interviews, laboratory
matching, and supplemental laboratory testing identified only 3
persons as infected with strains of HIV similar to that of the index
patient. As of 21 Jul 2006, the index patient and 2 of the patients
with matching genotypes were clinically stable and responding to
ARVs. The 3rd patient with a matching genotype was clinically stable
and responding to ARVs through April 2005 but has since been lost to
follow-up; he had not been matched to the New York City Death
Registry as of 30 Jun 2006.
Investigators were not able to determine exactly when or how, during
the period May 2003 to December 2004, the index patient was infected,
whether transmission of the HIV strain to the index patient was
direct from one of the 3 patients with matching genotypes or indirect
(i.e., passed through an unknown intermediate person), or whether the
index patient's viral genotype was from a single viral infection or
from recombination or superinfection. The index patient had multiple
partners, many anonymous, during the period in which he became
infected. The cluster of 3 patients with matching genotypes
represents only cases detected through laboratory matching and only
through 30 Jun 2005. At least 6400 HIV-infected MSM in NYC have never
been tested for HIV, and many other persons with diagnosed HIV
infection have never had genotyping. Therefore, the actual prevalence
of this or a similar MDR HIV genotype in NYC is unknown.
The index patient's HIV infection progressed to AIDS in <20 months;
the median period for transition to AIDS without treatment is 8 to 10
years (4). Available laboratory and medical records data were not
sufficient to establish whether this viral genotype was associated
with rapid progression to AIDS. Accelerated progression to AIDS and
transmission of MDR HIV-1 have been reported previously, although not
with this combination of high-level resistance and rapid progression
(5,6). Newly diagnosed MDR HIV in a sexually active MSM who had never
received ARV treatment raises several public health concerns.
Approximately 70 percent of the named partners of the index patient
had HIV infection, and the majority had other recent sexually
transmitted disease infections, indicating substantial potential for
transmission of HIV and possibly also MDR HIV. The findings in this
report, along with increasing syphilis rates, continuing gonorrhea
transmission, and the emergence of lymphogranuloma venereum in
HIV-positive MSM, reflect a resurgence of unsafe sex among MSM. This
behavior also has been associated with increasing use of methamphetamine (7).
The genotype data collected by NYCDOH indicated a low prevalence of
MDR genotypes among persons who had not been treated with ARVs and
who had HIV infections diagnosed during the period 1 Jun 2004 to 30
Jun 2005. Drug-resistant HIV compromises the effectiveness of
standard ARV regimens and can limit the treatment options available
to persons with newly diagnosed HIV infection (6). Therefore, CDC has
provided funding to 4 city and 17 state health departments to conduct
drug-resistance surveillance on remnant sera obtained from all
patients with newly diagnosed HIV infection (8). Provisional data
from these areas indicate that as many as 15 percent of these
patients are infected with an HIV strain that has mutations
associated with resistance to ARVs, and 3.2 percent have mutations
associated with resistance to 2 or more classes of such medications.
Case reports such as the one described here and results from
surveillance of newly diagnosed, drug-resistant HIV infections
contributed to recent changes in HIV-1 treatment guidelines issued by
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (9). These
guidelines now recommend performing drug-resistance testing before
initiation of therapy in patients who have never received ARV
treatment. To reduce HIV-associated morbidity and mortality in the
United States, public health officials should intensify measures to
improve early diagnosis, partner notification, and prevention
counseling for persons (particularly MSM) who are HIV positive and
should conduct population-based genotype surveillance to monitor the
emergence of unusual strains of HIV, particularly those with
mutations associated with ARV resistance (8,10).

[The isolation in New York City in late 2004 of a unique variant of
HIV exhibiting resistance to all 3 classes of anti-retroviral drugs,
combined with an enhanced progression to AIDS, from an individual who
had never received treatment with anti-retroviral drugs was
unexpected and alarming. Either this individual had the misfortune to
be infected with a rare spontaneous HIV mutant resistant to all 3
classes of anti-retroviral drugs or the extensive use of
anti-retroviral drugs in the community may have generated this
unwelcome triple drug-resistant variant. It was feared that an
outbreak of HIV infection and AIDS not amenable to treatment with
currently available drugs might be in the offing.
The MMWR report describes the outcome of an exhaustive program of
contact tracing and HIV genotyping to explore the question of the
origin and transmissibility of this multiple drug resistant strain of
HIV. Data obtained from interviews, laboratory matching, and
supplemental laboratory testing identified only 3 persons in the New
York area as infected with strains of HIV similar to that of the
index patient. These 3 were putative contacts of the index case. As
of 21 Jul 2006, the index patient and 2 of the patients with matching
genotypes were clinically stable and responding to ARVs.
These data do not elucidate the origin of the triple drug-resistant
strain, nor whether the index patient's viral genotype was from a
single viral infection or a consequence of recombination or
superinfection. They do indicate, however, that this HIV variant does
not appear to be endowed with enhanced transmissibility.
Nonetheless, ongoing surveys of a wider section of sexually active
males indicate that as many as 15 percent of patients are infected
with an HIV strain that has mutations associated with resistance to
anti-retroviral drugs and that 3.2 percent have mutations associated
with resistance to 2 or more classes of such agents. - Mod.CP]
