[For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2016, Chapter 2.3.14 "Newcastle disease" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.14_NEWCASTLE_DIS.pdf from which the following commentary is quoted:

"Newcastle disease (ND) is caused by virulent strains of avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1) serotype of the genus _Avulavirus_ belonging to the subfamily _Paramyxovirinae_, family _Paramyxoviridae_. The paramyxoviruses isolated from avian species have been classified by serological testing and phylogenetic analysis into 10 subtypes designated APMV-1 to APMV-10; ND virus (NDV) has been designated APMV-1.

"One of the most characteristic properties of different strains of NDV has been their great variation in pathogenicity for chickens. Strains of NDV have been grouped into 5 pathotypes on the basis of the clinical signs seen in infected chickens. These are:
1. Viscerotropic velogenic: a highly pathogenic form in which haemorrhagic intestinal lesions are frequently seen;
2. Neurotropic velogenic: a form that presents with high mortality, usually following respiratory and nervous signs;
3. Mesogenic: a form that presents with respiratory signs, occasional nervous signs, but low mortality;
4. Lentogenic or respiratory: a form that presents with mild or subclinical respiratory infection;
5. Asymptomatic: a form that usually consists of a subclinical enteric infection.

NDV is a human pathogen and the most common sign of infection in humans is conjunctivitis that develops within 24 hours of NDV exposure to the eye. Reported infections have been non-life threatening and usually not debilitating for more than a day or 2. The most frequently reported and best-substantiated clinical signs in human infections have been eye infections, usually consisting of unilateral or bilateral reddening, excessive lachrymation [flow of tears], oedema [excess fluid] of the eyelids, conjunctivitis and sub-conjunctival haemorrhage. Although the effect on the eye may be quite severe, infections are usually transient and the cornea is not affected. There is no evidence of human-to-human spread."

Romania has previously reported Newcastle disease, most recently in November 2015 and in April 2016 in the Province of Prahova.
