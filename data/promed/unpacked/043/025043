Public Health Response to a Rabid Dog in an Animal Shelter -- North
Dakota and Minnesota, 2010
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On 31 Mar 2010 the North Dakota Department of Health (NDDoH) was
notified by a local public health department that a stray dog found
in rural Minnesota and housed during 9-20 Mar 2010 in a North Dakota
animal shelter had been found to have rabies. NDDoH, along with the
local public health department, the North Dakota Board of Animal
Health (BOAH), the Minnesota Board of Animal Health, and the
Minnesota Department of Health, immediately began an investigation to
identify persons requiring rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and
to prevent further rabies transmission.

This report summarizes the public health investigation, which used
animal shelter records and public notification to identify possible
human and animal contacts of the rabid dog. Among 32 persons who
might have been exposed to the rabid dog at the shelter, 21 persons,
including 9 shelter employees and one volunteer, received PEP. In
accordance with 2009 Compendium of Animal Rabies Prevention and
Control guidance (1), the 25 dogs in the shelter with the rabid dog
were euthanized. Among 25 other dogs without an up-to-date rabies
vaccination that were adopted or claimed from the shelter and might
have been exposed, 11 were euthanized, 13 were isolated for 6 months
in their owners' homes, and one was unintentionally killed.

No additional cases of rabies in dogs or humans had been identified
as of December 2010. This event supports consideration of
pre-exposure vaccination of animal shelter employees and highlights
the continued importance of routine rabies vaccination of domestic animals.

On 9 Mar 2010, 2 stray dogs found by a sheriff's deputy in Marshall
County, Minnesota, were brought to an animal shelter in Grand Forks,
North Dakota. Marshall County is a rural area of Minnesota, and Grand
Forks offers the closest animal shelter. In accordance with animal
shelter protocol and city ordinance, the dogs were isolated from
other animals in the shelter for 5 days. During this time, the dogs
were observed for signs of disease or behavioral abnormalities. Dog A
was fearful of shelter staff members and dependent on dog B, which
was dominant, aggressive, and larger than dog A. On 15 Mar 2010,
after the 5 days of isolation, the 2 dogs were transferred to the
area holding the general shelter population and made available for
adoption. Because of its dominant and aggressive temperament,
however, dog B was deemed unsuitable for adoption and euthanized on
19 Mar 2010.

On 20 Mar 2010, dog A was placed with a foster family in North
Dakota. Then, 5 days later, the dog was vomiting and had loss of
balance. On 27 Mar 2010, the family returned the dog to the shelter,
where it was examined by a veterinarian, who noted hyperesthesia,
tremors, ataxia, and dilated pupils. Because the differential
diagnosis included canine distemper and rabies, the dog was
euthanized the same day, and the brain was sent to the state
veterinary diagnostic laboratory for testing. 3 days later, the
laboratory reported that a fluorescent antibody test was positive for
rabies virus. CDC confirmed the result and characterized the virus as
a North Central skunk rabies virus variant.

The animal shelter that housed the rabid dog takes in approximately
35--40 animals per week and can house up to 125 animals. The shelter
is operated by the local humane society and also serves as the city
pound, under a contract with Grand Forks. Dogs are kept in kennels
constructed with concrete walls to minimize contact between dogs.
Dogs are taken out of the kennels on leashes, and employees and
volunteers are instructed to prevent contact between dogs. However,
shelter employees could not verify that this policy was strictly
followed while dogs A and B were at the shelter.

Employees, volunteers, and visitors to the animal shelter could have
been exposed to rabies during 9-20 Mar 2010 while either dog was in
the shelter. Dog B was presumed to be rabid, based on the close
relationship with dog A and the possibility that they both were
exposed to rabies virus at the same time. In addition, anyone in
contact with dog A while it was with the foster family during 20-27
March 2010 also was at risk.

A review of employee records and volunteer logs identified 32 persons
who might have been exposed to the dogs at the shelter. 9 animal
shelter employees and one volunteer received PEP. 11 other persons
received PEP, including the 5 members of dog A's foster family and
one neighbor child, 3 members of the family who found dogs A and B in
Minnesota, and 2 children who visited the shelter. In total, 21
persons received PEP. Of the 15 persons whose exposures were
documented, all were licked by one of the dogs, and 5 had open wounds
on their hands. As of December 2010, no contacts had developed rabies.

The 2nd phase of the public health investigation involved identifying
animal contacts of the dogs. Although the shelter's animal handling
policies likely minimized contact among dogs, muzzle-to- muzzle
contact could not be ruled out; therefore, BOAH and NDDoH recommended
that all dogs present in the shelter from 9-20 Mar 2010 be
euthanized. All 25 dogs remaining in the shelter were euthanized.
Adoption and claimed pet records were used to identify 37 other dogs
that had been in the shelter during 9-20 Mar 2010, including 31 in
North Dakota, 5 in Minnesota, and one in Michigan. Among those dogs,
12 were up-to-date on rabies vaccination, including one in Minnesota
and one in Michigan. Of the 25 dogs without documented rabies
vaccination, the owners of 11 opted to euthanize them, and the owners
of 13 decided to confine their dogs for 6 months of observation. One
dog in North Dakota was unintentionally killed before a decision was
made. All euthanized dogs tested negative for rabies. No additional
cases of rabid animals related to possible shelter exposure had been
identified as of December 2010.

MMWR Editorial Note:
--------------------
The case described in this report demonstrates the risk for rabies
virus transmission from domestic animals and the importance of
vaccination and stray animal control programs in decreasing that
risk. In the United States, such programs have succeeded in
eliminating the canine rabies virus variant and decreased the number
of laboratory-confirmed cases of rabies in dogs from 6949 in 1947 to
75 in 2008 (1,2). Nevertheless, reintroduction of the canine rabies
virus variant remains a threat, as illustrated by the importation of
a rabid dog from Iraq in 2008 (3). In addition, rabies virus in
indigenous wildlife reservoirs throughout the United States can be
transmitted to unprotected domestic animals, as probably occurred in
the case described in this report.

Vaccination and animal control programs are the best strategies to
protect against rabies and the resulting public health consequences.
Rabid domestic animals have the potential to affect public health
resources substantially. For example, the total cost to respond to a
single rabid dog in California in 1980 was estimated to be USD 105
790 (4). A similar situation in 1994 involving a single rabid kitten
purchased from a pet store led to a total of 665 persons receiving
PEP at an estimated overall cost of USD 1.5 million (5). The
identification of a rabid animal in any such public setting should
prompt an immediate response to investigate potential exposures and
institute prevention and control efforts to protect the health of the public.

Rabies virus is transmitted by bites from a rabid animal or by saliva
or other potentially infectious material (e.g., neural tissue) that
is introduced into fresh, open cuts in skin or onto mucous membranes
(6,7). Activities such as petting an animal; contact with the blood,
urine, or feces of an animal; or contact of saliva with intact skin
are not exposures and therefore do not require PEP (6,7).

Development of a standardized risk assessment with strict application
of these exposure definitions might decrease the number of persons
receiving PEP in any rabies exposure situation, including this one,
in which all exposures of persons receiving PEP were not documented
fully. In addition, pre-exposure prophylaxis for animal shelter
workers or other persons whose activities bring them into frequent
contact with potentially infected animals should be considered, in
accordance with Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
recommendations (6).

Pre-exposure prophylaxis consists of 3 doses of vaccine administered
on days 0, 7, and 21 or 28 (6,7). Although the initial cost can be a
concern, pre-exposure prophylaxis decreases costs for PEP after a
subsequent exposure by obviating the need for rabies immunoglobulin,
reducing the number of vaccine doses from 4 to 2, and decreasing the
number of visits to a health-care provider. Pre-exposure prophylaxis
also might help protect persons from unrecognized exposures or offer
partial immunity when PEP is delayed.

Several measures should be instituted in animal shelters and other
public settings where humans are exposed to animals to decrease the
risk for rabies virus transmission and to facilitate the
epidemiologic investigation of identified cases. 1st, all domestic
animals should be vaccinated against rabies, in accordance with
guidelines (1,8). 2nd, animals without documentation of vaccination
against rabies should be kept separate from the public, wildlife, and
other animals to prevent transmission of the virus (5,8).

In this case, 36 dogs had to be euthanized because employees and
volunteers might not have consistently followed the shelter's policy
of preventing muzzle-to-muzzle contact between dogs. 3rd, each
facility should maintain adequate records, including rabies
vaccination certificates, animal source documentation, and adoption
and sales records, to facilitate the investigation of any possible
exposures. Strict adherence to these recommendations will protect
humans from exposures and also can protect animals involved with an
exposure from being euthanized.

[In the United States, canine rabies elimination was achieved through
implementation of dog vaccination and licensing, and stray dog
control (see: Rabies, canine - USA: eliminated 20070912.3013). What
is lacking is enforcement of vaccination of all susceptible domestic
(companion) animals to prevent the re-introduction of rabies into the
domestic animal population via the viruses still endemic in wildlife
in the United States. Canines are at risk of rabies disease
irrespective of the origin of the infecting rabies virus. In the
situation described in the above report, the outbreak was initiated
by a North Central skunk rabies virus.

This report describes the epidemiologic investigation and public
health response to a rabid dog identified in an animal shelter and
the associated administration of post-exposure prophylaxis to 21
persons and euthanization of 36 dogs. Animal shelters should ensure
that adopted animals are vaccinated against rabies, consider
pre-exposure prophylaxis for employees and volunteers, and prevent
contact between unvaccinated animals to decrease the risk for rabies
virus transmission. - Mod.CP]
