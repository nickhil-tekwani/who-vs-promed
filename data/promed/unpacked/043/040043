Healthcare experts in Bangalore are on red alert due to a chikungunya
outbreak in the city, according to the Directorate of Health and
Family Welfare. In spite of the efforts of the Health Department to
eradicate the mosquitoes, which spread the disease, at the source,
the mosquitoes continue to breed, leading to long queues of patient's
suffering from the disease.
Chikungunya fever is a viral disease transmitted to humans by the
bite of an infected mosquito (_Aedes aegypti_, the yellow fever
mosquito). This mosquito is a household-container breeder and
aggressive daytime biter.
Chikungunya is a debilitating illness, most often characterized by
fever, headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, muscle pain, rash, and joint pain.
The incubation period (time from infection to illness) can be 2-12
days, but is usually 3-7 days. "Silent" chikungunya infections
(infections without illness) do occur, but how commonly this happens
is not yet known.
Acute chikungunya fever typically lasts a few days to a couple of
weeks, but as with dengue, some patients have prolonged fatigue
lasting several weeks. Additionally, some patients have reported
incapacitating joint pain, or arthritis, which may last for weeks or
months. The prolonged joint pain associated with chikungunya is not
typical of dengue. The infection is thought to confer life-long immunity.
No deaths, neuroinvasive cases, or hemorrhagic cases related to
chikungunya infection have been conclusively documented in the
scientific literature.
Treatment is symptomatic and includes rest, fluids, and drugs to
relieve symptoms of fever and aching, like ibuprofen. Aspirin should
be avoided during the acute stages of the illness.
The best way to avoid infection is to prevent mosquito bites, as
there is no vaccine or preventive drug available to treat the
infection. Preventive measures like use of insect repellents, getting
rid of mosquito breeding sites by emptying standing water, and having
secure screens on windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out can help
prevent the disease.
The Director of Health and Family Welfare, Dr. M.G. Prasad said the
disease continues to spread because of the long storage of drinking
water by residents. "We are told that the supply of water is only
once every 2 days, and many residents prefer to store water in huge
containers. The water is stored for weeks together. This can become a
fine breeding ground for mosquitoes. The situation is similar in the
districts," he added.

Bangalore is in the center of the southern tip.
Chikungunya cases are spreading across parts of India. ProMED will be
interested in receiving information about the numbers of cases in
Bangalore and the success that local health officials have in
reducing _Aedes_ breeding sites. - Mod.TY]
[Bangalore is the "Silicon Valley" of India, accounting for 35
percent of India's software exports. With a population of 6 million,
it is the 3rd largest city of India, and has clearly outgrown its
infrastructure. We overnighted there in May this year in the center
of the city, and in the middle of a tremendous thuinderstorm the
power went out. Until an uninterrupted piped water supply can be
assured, the city will continue to suffer unnecessarily from dengue &
chikungunya. - Mod.JW]
