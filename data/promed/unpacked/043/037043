More than 1000 north Queensland residents are at risk of a deadly form of
dengue fever after a new outbreak of the virus in Cairns.
Cairns City Council began fumigating every house along the city's Esplanade
- the waterfront area where people are believed to be most at risk. Health
authorities also declared a dengue fever watch from Mackay to the Torres
Strait.
Thirteen confirmed or suspected cases have been recorded since Wednesday.
Health authorities fear the disease could be spreading quickly because it
was first reported by staff at a backpackers' hostel.
Tropical Public Health Unit entomologist Scott Ritchie said most of the
hostel workers and guests had been traced but the whereabouts of some were
still unknown.
A spokesman said the latest outbreak was caused by a new variety of dengue-3
virus. "That concerns us greatly because the last one was type 2. When you
get people being infected sequentially by two different strains they can
develop dengue haemorrhagic fever," he said.
Most people [recover from dengue with no sequelae, but those who develop
haemorrhagic fever suffer serious illness and can die.
"What we have done to control this is declare a dengue watch over urban
north Queensland from Mackay to Torres Strait.
We've also declared a dengue warning area over part of Cairns, which means
people should be aware the disease is right there and happening now.
The warning covers an area bordered by the world-famous Cairns waterfront,
one of the busiest streets in the city, and extending toward the
international airport.
A major television, radio and newspaper public awareness campaign also will
be launched to fight the outbreak.
A spokesman for Mayor Tom Pyne said the council had immediately gone on full
alert and that the city is fumigating every building and house along The
Esplanade. They are also asking residents to take action themselves.
In 1992-1993, 750 people were struck down in Townsville and Charters Towers
in Queensland's worst dengue episode.
The spokesman said recent warm and moist conditions in Cairns were ideal for
an outbreak.

[I take it that the "1,000 north Queensland residents ... at risk of a
deadly form of dengue fever" is meant to indicate those people who were
infected during the 1992-93 epidemic and who might now be in danger of
acquiring a second dengue infection and therefore be at risk of developing
dengue hemorrhagic fever. If that is a correct read of the report, that
eventuality is not likely because most of those infected in the 1992-93
epidemic were adults. Nonetheless, this is a potentially serious situation
in which north Queensland, as are so many parts of the world, is becoming
hyperendemic for dengue.
This report reflects the obvious concern of local authorities. The Cairns
area is a tourist destination and this is not only the end of spring there
but the pre-Christmas season as well. People flock to north Queensland from
throughout Australia as well as from overseas, visiting from Mackay and
Townsville south of Cairns to the Cape York peninsula to the north and the
Great Barrier Reef islands. I am certain that the local authorities
including Scott Ritchie, the staff at James Cook University in Townsville,
and John Mackenzie and his staff at the University of Queensland will keep
us apprised of the situation as it develops. -- Mod CHC
