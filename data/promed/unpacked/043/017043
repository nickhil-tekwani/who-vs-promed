Since the beginning of 2017, the Texas Department of State Health Services says it has seen more than 400 reported cases of flea-borne typhus, the highest in the past 16 years. Due to the increase in the number of cases across the state, the state agency is reminding people to take precautions to prevent contracting the disease. Flea-borne typhus, also known as murine typhus, is a bacterial infection that most commonly occurs when infected flea feces are scratched into the site of the flea bite or another break in the skin. Fleas are infected when they bite animals, such as rodents, opossums and cats, that can maintain and transmit the bacteria. Rat and cat fleas are the primary vectors.

In 2017, the increased typhus activity has been reported in the Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston areas. In 2016, the state recorded 364 cases.

The state is also requesting health care professionals keep an eye out for patients who have a fever have one or more of the following: headache, myalgia, anorexia, rash, nausea/vomiting, thrombocytopenia, or any hepatic transaminase elevation.

Early symptoms of flea-borne typhus develop within 14 days of contact with infected fleas and include headache, fever, nausea and body aches. Five or 6 days after the initial symptoms, a rash that starts on the trunk of the body and spreads to the arms and legs may occur. Flea-borne typhus is easily treated with certain antimicrobials, and people will not get it again after they recover.

Precautions to prevent flea-borne typhus:
- Keep yards clean so that rodents, opossums and stray cats cannot live there by removing any brush or trash, keeping the grass mowed and keeping firewood off the ground.
- Do not leave pet food out at night as this attracts other animals.
- Prevent rodents from living in houses.
- Treat for fleas with a commercial flea control product before beginning rodent control in houses or yards. Fleas will search for new hosts when rodents die.
- Control the fleas on pets regularly. Ask a veterinarian about flea control products that are safe to use on pets.
- Wear gloves and insect repellent when handling sick or dead animals.
- Use insect repellent when hunting, camping or engaging in any other outdoor activities.

[There are 5 classical diseases with typhus literally or figuratively in their names: epidemic typhus, Brill-Zinsser disease (recrudescent epidemic typhus), murine typhus, scrub typhus, and typhoid (so-called because it is typhus-like). The term typhus comes from the Greek, _typhein_ -- to smoke -- which may refer to the smoky or clouded mental status that patients present with.

Murine typhus, caused by _Rickettsia typhi_, is distributed widely throughout the world, especially in the warm and humid coastal environments of tropic and subtropical climes. In the developed world, the infection is found in the Caribbean, and in the USA most of the cases are reported from Texas (where the geographic distribution has increased), in southern California and Hawaii. In Europe, it is distributed along the Mediterranean coast as well as the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts of Africa. It is a zoonosis in which rats function as the disease's asymptomatic reservoir, and the Oriental rat flea _Xenopsylla cheopis_ is the commonest vector. Although generally coastal in distribution, the disease may well spread away from the coast via major routes of transportation. Although rickettsia-infected flea feces being rubbed into a flea bite appears to be the major vehicle of transmission to humans, flea bites themselves and aerosolization of flea feces may transmit infection as well.

Murine typhus is a relatively mild disease. Among patients admitted to an acute care hospital with this disease, only 10 percent require an intensive care unit setting, and only 1-4 percent die.

Tetracyclines appear to remain the drug of choice in treatment. - Mod.LL
