PIG EPIDEMIC IN WAMENA,177 DEAD
Wamena, Kompas Online
One hundred and seventy-seven residents of the remote villages of
Brome and Ndugwa in Wamena, Jayawijaya (Irian Jaya) have died after
being struck by a fatal pig epidemic. Information delays prevented a
medical team from attending to the sick earlier.
Regent of Jayawijaya JB Wenas told Kompas and Suara Pembaruan at the
Wamena airport on Monday (26/2) that reports about the epidemic
affecting 120 people from Brome were received three days ago. A
medical team, dispatched by Jayawijaya authorities, were now in Brome
located near the Papua New Guinea border.
News from Ndugwa only arrived on Monday (26/2). On Tuesday morning a
medical team will fly to the region by a Mission Aviation Fellowship
helicopter.
According to Wenas, the pig epidemic had once struck the people of the
town of Wamena. Symptoms of the epidemic include breathing
disturbances, followed by vomiting blood, followed by death.
Wenas said if reports had come out earlier then the local authorities
could have been faster to take action. "The delay may have been caused
because the couriers feared leaving the village because of the hostage
case," he said in relation to the ongoing hostage case in the region.
"It may also have been because of the difficult terrain," he added.*
