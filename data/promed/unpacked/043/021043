Outbreak of _Salmonella_ infections linked to Hy-Vee Spring Pasta Salad
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Since the last update on 18 Jul 2018, 58 ill people have been added to this investigation. This includes 6 people who have been infected with a strain of _Salmonella enterica_ subspecies IIIb, and 2 people infected with this strain and with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Sandiego at the same time.

As of 30 Jul 2018, 79 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ Sandiego (71 people), _S. enterica_ subspecies IIIb (6 people), or both (2 people) have been reported from 9 states.

State / ill people
------------------
Illinois / 2
Iowa / 26
Kansas / 2
Minnesota / 20
Missouri / 3
Nebraska / 9
North Dakota / 1
South Dakota / 15
Tennessee / 1
-----------------
Total / 79

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 21 Jun 2018 to 15 Jul 2018. Ill people range in age from 1 year to 89, with a median age of 47. Among ill people, 67 percent are female. Out of 74 people with information available, 18 (24 percent) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Illnesses that occurred after 8 Jul 2018, might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks.

State and local health officials continue to interview ill people and ask questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. 47 (80 percent) of 59 people interviewed reported eating Spring Pasta Salad from Hy-Vee grocery stores in Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Nebraska, and South Dakota. The ill people in North Dakota and Tennessee traveled to states where Hy-Vee grocery stores are located.

This investigation is ongoing, and CDC will provide updates when more information is available.

[The specific mode of contamination of the pasta salad and which ingredient is involved has not been elucidated as yet. That some of the contamination is due to _Salmonella enterica_ subspecies IIIb may be a useful hint as this category is not as common as a human pathogen.

The following statement is this regard is extracted from Brenner FW, Villar RG, Angulo FJ, Tauxe R, Swaminathan B: _Salmonella_ nomenclature. J Clin Microbiol 2000; 38(7): 2465-67 (http://jcm.asm.org/content/38/7/2465.long):

"The majority (59 percent) of the 2463 _Salmonella_ serotypes belong to _S. enterica_ subsp. I (_S. enterica_ subsp. _enterica_). Within _S. enterica_ subsp. I, the most common O-antigen serogroups are A, B, C1, C2, D, and E. Strains in these serogroups cause approximately 99 percent of _Salmonella_ infections in humans and warm-blooded animals. Serotypes in _S. enterica_ subspecies II (_S. enterica_ subsp. _salamae_), IIIa (_S. enterica_ subsp. _arizonae_), IIIb (_S. enterica_ subsp. _diarizonae_), IV (_S. enterica_ subsp. _houtenae_), VI (_S. enterica_ subsp. _indica_), and V (_S. bongori_) are usually isolated from cold-blooded animals and the environment but rarely from humans." - Mod.LL
