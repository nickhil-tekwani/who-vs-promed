4th case of anthrax has been recorded in the West Georgia
---------------------------------------------------------
The severe form of anthrax was found in Rodinaury village, Zestafonsky
district; 2 persons were admitted to the Infectious Diseases
Department of the hospital in Zestafony several days ago when their
health condition sharply became worse. The patients received treatment
in time and now their lives are safe.

The source of the infection was sick cattle. This is the 4th case of
anthrax in west Georgia during the last month. All patients are alive.

[According to the National centre of disease control and medical
statistics of Georgia, 18 cases of anthrax have been recorded already
this year (2008). Last year [2007] 42 cases were reported; see:
<http://www.day.az/news/georgia/125324.html>.

The population of Georgia is about 4.5 million inhabitants. This
amount of anthrax cases shows a high level of morbidity for such small
country - Mod.NP]

[The news report is a mite confused as it has a headline on the 4th
case and then refers to 2 people being hospitalised, presumably the
3rd and 4th individuals to be diagnosed. Georgia rarely reports more
than 6 bovine outbreaks in any one year, and only a smattering of
outbreaks in sheep, goats and horses, but it has widespread human
cases throughout the country: 51 (1999), 29 (2000), 26 (2001), 15
(2002), 27 (2003), 45 (2004), 19 (2005), 38 (2006), & 42 (2007). This
reflects a general failure of veterinary public health, government
veterinary services, and of public health. - Mod.MHJ]
