An 11-year-old local girl has caught brucellosis -- the 1st case recorded in Macau in 25 years, according to a statement by the Health Bureau (SSM). She presented symptoms associated with febrile disease, including a fever, a mouth ulcer, a rash, and elbow pain. She sought treatment at the public hospital several times, as her fever would not subside. Blood tests later confirmed the diagnosis of brucellosis. SSM said that the 11-year-old girl had not visited any rural areas, nor had she been in contact with any animals other than a neighbor's dog. Information provided by the girl's family also showed that she had not drunk any unpasteurized milk products. SSM said that it is not yet able to confirm how the child contracted the disease.

[ProMED-mail would appreciate additional information about this case as it is not specifically stated what blood tests confirmed the diagnosis of brucellosis.

A serological diagnosis can be a false positive one as reported many times including CDC: Public health consequences of a false-positive laboratory test result for Brucella--Florida, Georgia, and Michigan, 2005; CDC. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2008; 57(22): 603-5; http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5722a3.htm:

Abstract
--------
Human brucellosis, a nationally notifiable disease, is uncommon in the United States. Most human cases have occurred in returned travelers or immigrants from regions where brucellosis is endemic, or were acquired domestically from eating illegally imported, unpasteurized fresh cheeses. In January 2005, a woman aged 35 years who lived in Nassau County, Florida, received a diagnosis of brucellosis, based on results of a _Brucella_ immunoglobulin M (IgM) enzyme immunoassay (EIA) performed in a commercial laboratory using analyte specific reagents (ASRs); this diagnosis prompted an investigation of dairy products in 2 other states. Subsequent confirmatory antibody testing by _Brucella_ microagglutination test (BMAT) performed at CDC on the patient's serum was negative. The case did not meet the CDC/Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists' (CSTE) definition for a probable or confirmed brucellosis case, and the initial EIA result was determined to be a false positive. This report summarizes the case history, laboratory findings, and public health investigations. CDC recommends that _Brucella_ serology testing only be performed using tests cleared or approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or validated under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) and shown to reliably detect the presence of _Brucella_ infection. Results from these tests should be considered supportive evidence for recent infection only and interpreted in the context of a clinically compatible illness and exposure history. EIA is not considered a confirmatory _Brucella_ antibody test; positive screening test results should be confirmed by _Brucella_-specific agglutination (that is, BMAT or standard tube agglutination test) methods.

In parallel, misidentification of the organism can occur in rapid bacterial identification systems as documented in Barham WB, Church P, Brown JE, Paparello S: Misidentification of _Brucella_ species with use of rapid bacterial identification systems. Clin Infect Dis. 1993; 17(6): 1068-9, and elsewhere.

Furthermore, in addition to the classical species of _Brucella_, _melitensis_, _suis_, and _abortus_, _B. canis_ can be transmitted to humans as reported in Lucero NE, Escobar GI, Ayala SM, Jacob N: Diagnosis of human brucellosis caused by Brucella canis. J Med Microbiol. 2005; 54 (Pt 5): 457-61; http://jmm.sgmjournals.org/content/journal/jmm/10.1099/jmm.0.45927-0#tab2.

Abstract
--------
The transmission of _Brucella canis_ to man commonly occurs through contact with infected dogs or their secretions, or through direct laboratory exposure. The disease is underdiagnosed due to a general lack of serological testing facilities and misconceptions concerning its prevalence. This report shows the potential use of an indirect ELISA (IELISA) for the diagnosis of human brucellosis caused by _B. canis_ in a population of patients negative by smooth-_Brucella_ antigen tests but positive by rapid slide agglutination test (RSAT). 110 sera from asymptomatic people found negative by tests using smooth _B. abortus_ antigen and by RSAT showed an IELISA specificity of 100 percent when a cut-off value of 27 percent positivity was selected. For 17 sera from patients with positive _B. canis_ culture or in close contact with culture-positive dogs, the IELISA sensitivity was 100 percent with the same cut-off value. The positive patients presented clinical symptoms similar to brucellosis caused by other species of _Brucella_ and some of them received antibiotic treatment and made good progress. Using this cut-off value, we studied 35 patients with negative blood cultures but positive RSATs, and IELISA detected 18 as positive; of the 17 IELISA-negative, 2 were RSAT-positive at dilution 1:2 and 15 were weakly positive with pure serum. These samples were probably from patients at an early stage of infection or indicate false-positive results. No cross-reaction was observed among the sera from 9 cases with a diagnosis other than brucellosis, but cross-reactivity was evident in sera from patients infected with smooth-_Brucella_ species. Since routine brucellosis diagnosis does not include _B. canis_ investigation, infection with this species may be more widespread than is currently suspected. The RSAT could be a suitable screening test for the diagnosis of _B. canis_ human brucellosis, and a supplementary technique, such as IELISA, performed on all positive RSAT samples that were negative by _B. abortus_ antigen could ensure diagnostic specificity and confirm the diagnosis. - Mod.LL]
