The Rhode Island Department of Health is warning of a botulism risk with products sold by a Cranston store.

The Health Department is telling consumers to avoid juices, smoothies and sea moss gel from Health is Wealth Nutrition Center, which is located at 1674 Cranston Street. No health issues have been associated with the products, but the Health Department is nevertheless telling consumers to throw them out.

Botulism is a rare but potentially fatal illness caused by a toxin that attacks the body's nerves, according to the CDC. The Health Department says it issued the warning because of the potential for processing, storage, and control issues with the products. Inadequate processing allows for the survival of the toxin that can cause botulism, according to the Health Department.

Sea Moss juice comes in blackberry, fruit punch, soursop guanabana, strawberry, passion fruit, pineapple, mango, guava guayaba, and tamarind, among others. Symptoms of botulism include weakness, dizziness, double vision and trouble speaking, swallowing, or breathing, according to the Health Department. Anyone with those symptoms should seek medical care.

The Health Department provided the following descriptions of the products:

- Health is Wealth Sea Moss Drink. The juice is sold in a variety of flavors including but not limited to Blackberry, Fruit Punch, Soursop/Guanabana, Strawberry, Passion Fruit, Pineapple, Mango, Guava Guayaba, and Tamarind. These products are sold in 12oz and 16oz containers.

- Health is Wealth Sea Moss Smoothie. The smoothie is sold in a variety of flavors including but not limited to Pina Colada, Peanut Punch, Soursop/Guanabana, Cinnamon Vanilla, and Mango. These products are sold in 12oz and 16oz containers.

- Health is Wealth Sea Moss Gel. The gel is sold in a variety of flavors including Sea Moss, Bladderwrack, Aloe Vera Gel, Sea Moss Bladderwrack Gel, and Sea Moss Gel. These products are sold in 16 oz containers.

- Health is Wealth Sea Moss Protein Shakes. The shakes are sold in a variety of flavors including but not limited to Peanut and Cinnamon. These products are sold in 12oz and 16oz containers.

Botulism can cause death due to respiratory failure, although survival rates have improved dramatically because of the development of antitoxin and modern medical care, according to the CDC. 50 years ago, death rates from botulism were 50%. Now, fewer than 5 of every 100 people with botulism die, the CDC says.

[_Chondrus crispus_ (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondrus_crispus) -- commonly called Irish moss or carrageen moss (Irish carraigin, "little rock") -- is a species of red algae which grows abundantly along the rocky parts of the Atlantic coast of Europe and North America. In its fresh condition, this protist is soft and cartilaginous, varying in color from a greenish-yellow, through red, to a dark purple or purplish-brown. The principal constituent is a mucilaginous body, made of the polysaccharide carrageenan, which constitutes 55% of its dry weight. The organism also consists of nearly 10% dry weight protein and about 15% dry weight mineral matter and is rich in iodine and sulfur. When softened in water, it has a sea-like odor, and because of the abundant cell wall polysaccharides, it will form a jelly when boiled, containing from 20 to 100 times its weight of water.

It is not specifically stated that all of the mentioned products actually contain the processed sea moss, but the name is contained in each product.

Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures that could, but do not necessarily, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
