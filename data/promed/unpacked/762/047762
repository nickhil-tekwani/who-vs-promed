Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: an ongoing comprehensive epidemiological investigation is being conducted by State Departments of Agriculture and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) officials. Update as of 27 Feb 2013
- The CEM [contagious equine metritis] positive mare breeding activities have been limited, with all recent breeding to a 20-year-old Lusitano stallion in California, both by artificial insemination (AI) and live cover. That stallion, which was imported to the United States in 2003, has been found positive at the NVSL [National Veterinary Services Laboratory ] for _T. equigenitalis_, and his isolate matches the index mare's isolate on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).
- The positive mare and stallion are in the process of completing treatment and testing protocols.
- In addition to the index mare, 11 other horses (10 stallions, 1 mare) have been identified as having possible exposure to the positive stallion. All exposed horses will be tested for _T. equigenitalis_ according to established protocols.
- The epidemiological and diagnostic investigation conducted to date finds no relationship between the positive mare and any previous US cases of CEM.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; no vaccination; treatment of affected animals (all testing and treatment protocols are being done following federal, international, and expert guidance and requirements).
Measures to be applied: no other measures
