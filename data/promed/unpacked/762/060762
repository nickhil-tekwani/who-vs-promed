Pneumonia outbreak hits bighorn sheep
-------------------------------------
Wildlife officials say pneumonia has been confirmed in another bighorn
sheep population in west-central Montana. The Montana Fish, Wildlife and
Parks (FWP) says the respiratory disease was found in 5 sheep in the
Skalkaho population east of Hamilton. An FWP biologist has observed about
100 sheep in the population and shot 8 that showed signs of having
pneumonia. Samples from 5 of them were collected for further analysis.

Wildlife officials are expected to spend the next couple of days evaluating
the extent of the potential outbreak and deciding the best response.

Recent pneumonia outbreaks affected bighorn sheep populations in the East
Fork of the Bitterroot late last fall [2009] and herds in the Bonner area
and Lower and Upper Rock Creek in January and February [2010].

Bighorn sheep usually die within a few weeks of contracting the disease.

[_Mannheimia haemolytica_ (formerly _Pasteurella haemolytica_) and
_Pasteurella multocida_ are the commonest bacterial causes of pneumonia in
sheep. Most sheep affected display some degree of anorexia, some evidence
of labored breathing, and loss of weight.

While culling of sick animals may seem extreme, this particular disease
runs through bighorn sheep with disastrous results so it may be the way to
save the larger portion of the herd.

If samples from any of the bighorn sheep have been sent for testing, we
would appreciate knowing the outcome of the bacterial cultures.

While heat and summer time can be as stressful to these creatures as the
cold, it still seems early in the year to be finding this disease.
