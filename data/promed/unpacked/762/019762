Idaho: first probable human case of West Nile virus infection
-------------------------------------------------------------
State laboratory results have identified Idahos first probable human case
of West Nile virus infection acquired within Idahos borders. The man works
with a Twin Falls County farm; his only known exposure to the virus came
when he worked with sick alligators later determined to be carrying the
virus. The man, in his 40s, has completely recovered from the infection and
poses no health threat to other Idaho residents. Lab tests conducted at the
Idaho Department of Health and Welfares Bureau of Laboratories were
positive for West Nile virus. The state is waiting for confirmation of its
test results by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
"We are very glad to report that this gentleman is well. The symptoms he
experienced were very mild," said Dr Christine Hahn, state epidemiologist
with the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. "We do not believe the
public is at any increased risk for infection with the virus. In fact,
recent freezing temperatures all but eliminate any risk of exposure to
mosquitoes that might be carrying the virus until next spring."
Health officials have not determined how the man picked up the virus. He
does not recall being bitten by mosquitoes, by far the most common way in
which humans pick up the disease. However, his recent work involved using
bare hands to handle ill juvenile alligators that later were identified as
carrying the virus. The alligators were being raised at a local exotic
animal farm. The juvenile alligators he handled were part of a shipment of
1000 alligators imported from Florida in September. The animals were
imported legally and were housed in an enclosed, secure building. They
became ill almost immediately on arrival, according to the farmer. Hundreds
of the alligators died before a connection to West Nile virus was made.
Officials from the departments of Health and Welfare, Agriculture and South
Central District Health are working with the farm operator to assure public
safety. The farmer voluntarily had the remaining alligators humanely
destroyed and safely disposed of, under guidance from the wildlife section
of the Idaho Department of Agriculture. Following recommendations from
South Central District Health officials, the farmer also has disinfected
the enclosed building where the infected alligators were being raised.
"Aquatic life in other parts of the farm are not exhibiting any symptoms of
the virus. Again, there appears to be no increased risk to the general
public," Hahn said. "The owner of the alligators acted very responsibly. We
believe there is no threat of the virus spreading to the general
population," Hahn added. "And, with the recent freezing temperatures, the
threat of the virus being spread by mosquitoes is over for the year."
Six others who work at the farm also were tested for the infection.
Specimens drawn from all 6 came back negative for West Nile. About 20 per
cent of people who are infected with West Nile virus have symptoms of the
infection, which can include headaches, body aches, and mild fever. Less
than one per cent of people infected develop a serious illness from the
viral infection. "We have known for some time that West Nile was coming,"
Hahn said. "Counting Idaho, the virus has been found in 46 states now,
including our neighboring states of Montana, Wyoming, Utah, and Nevada.
And, we can expect that it will reappear in Idaho next year."
Throughout the spring, summer and early fall, Idaho surveyed mosquito
populations for the virus, and tested dead magpies, crows and jays
submitted through District Health departments. No mosquitoes ­- let alone
infected mosquitoes ­- were found at the farm last week. No infected
mosquitoes were found during the spring or summer when ongoing surveillance
was conducted within 10 miles of the farms location. West Nile virus has a
high mortality rate among these birds, and most states have discovered the
virus in their states through dead bird testing. Testing of mosquitoes and
birds will resume in the spring.
