Algae blooms a growing problem
Don't touch the water, cottage country warned
------------------
The campground was immaculate and the beach freshly raked, but on a perfect
summer morning this week, Camping Kirkland was practically deserted. The
shimmering waters of Missisquoi Bay, owner Christa Baertschi advised
potential campers, were toxic.
With its name borrowed from the Italian city of canals and romance,
Venise-en-Quebec used to be a destination of choice for Quebec vacationers.
But the appearance in recent years of toxin-producing algae in the bay at
the northern end of Lake Champlain -- as well as the related deaths of
several dogs, and warnings to avoid "all direct contact" with the water --
has scared away all but the bravest swimmers. As government-ordered beach
closings come earlier every summer, a town built on tourism is wondering
how long it can survive.
"It's a natural resource, the lake," Ms. Baertschi said. "It should be here
for generations to come. If they don't find a solution soon, the lake is
going to end up being a swamp."
Scientists say the blue-green algae choking Missisquoi Bay are turning up
increasingly in lakes across North America. Environment Canada has
identified the algae as "a growing threat to water quality in Canada and
around the world." Hamilton Harbour and Bay of Quinte on Lake Ontario face
serious algae problems, as does Lake Winnipeg.
The algae bloom when warm surface temperatures and calm conditions combine
with an abundance of phosphorus in the water from fertilizer or human
waste. The organisms produce toxins that can cause serious health effects
in humans and can kill dogs. The Vermont Department of Health reported 2
dogs died in 2002 after swallowing algae -- one on the Canadian side of
Missisquoi Bay and one on the American side. That followed several
algae-related dog deaths in Lake Champlain in 1999 and 2000.
Gregory Boyer, a biochemist at the State University of New York in Syracuse
who is studying the algae problem in Lake Champlain, said in one case, a
Labrador retriever was dead within an hour of being exposed to the algae.
He said the situation in the lake, which is surrounded by intensive
farming, appears to be worsening.
Quebec is working with Vermont and New York state, which also borders Lake
Champlain, to find ways of reducing the pollution flowing into the lake. An
agreement signed last year between Quebec and Vermont specified 60 percent
of the phosphorus entering the bay is from Vermont sources and 40 percent
is from Quebec. It calls for a gradual reduction of that input, largely
through controls in farming practices and sewage treatment, but the full
impact will not be felt until 2016.
Michel Jobin, an aide to Thomas Mulcair, Quebec's Environment Minister,
said the new Liberal government intends to make Missisquoi Bay a priority.
But he said there are no immediate solutions. "It is a problem that has
persisted for many years, and it will not be solved in a few weeks," he said.
Dr. Boyer's forecast was also gloomy. He said the best way to reduce the
risk to humans in the short term is to improve the identification of algae
blooms so they can be avoided.
"The toxic species is established, and it's likely going to be here for a
long time," he said. "It's like zebra mussels or loosestrife or dandelions:
Once it's established, it's hard to get rid of."
It is not exactly good for business, but sharing these sobering facts is
part of operating a beach in Venise-en-Quebec these days. As required by
the public-health authorities who closed the beach on 25 Jul 2003, Ms.
Baertschi has staff posted at the entrance to distribute pamphlets about
the algae.
"Avoid all direct contact with the water, e.g., swimming and aquatic
activities (note that a wet suit will not protect the skin)," the document
advises. "Do not drink the water and do not use it to prepare or cook food
(boiling the water will not eliminate the toxins) .... Avoid consuming fish
or other aquatic species taken from the affected area. Do not let animals
drink water or bathe in it."
How does one know if he has been exposed? Stomach ache, diarrhea, vomiting,
and nausea are some of the symptoms. Also possible are irritation of the
skin, nose, throat and eyes, and -- "more rarely" -- liver damage and
nervous system damage.
This is the third straight summer provincial authorities have closed the
beaches after detecting high levels of microcystin, the toxin produced by
the algae. In the past, Venise-en-Quebec business people were reluctant to
make a fuss, fearful they would only further tarnish their town's name by
drawing attention to the pollution. But now they are starting to realize
staying silent is accomplishing nothing.
Murray Charlton, an Environment Canada research scientist in Hamilton, said
Canadians should not be complacent about the quality of their water. He
began noticing the blue-green algae blooms reappearing in Hamilton Harbour
in 1999 after more than a decade's absence.
"I feel, personally, that people should be concerned about this and we
should be making plans about how to deal with this instead of just saying,
let's get used to it," he said. "There are more and more people living
around these bodies of water and, we can't keep doing the same things we
did 40 years ago."

[Many species of cyanobacteria produce populations that are toxic to humans
and animals. Blue- green pond scums have been linked to the poisoning of
cattle and dogs, and occasionally people. Some species of cyanobacteria
appear to be non-toxic and are harvested as a food source. It is therefore
not recommended that wild populations be gathered and eaten without some
knowledge of the organisms involved. Cyanobacteria may cause other problems
as well; a species of _Lyngbya_ is responsible for one of the skin
irritations commonly known as "swimmer's itch."
Toxic algae can produce a number of different toxins, some capable of
killing animals within a very short time. Toxic blooms should be taken
seriously and public health warning heeded. - Mod.TG]
