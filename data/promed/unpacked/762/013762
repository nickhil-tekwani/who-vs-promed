Plant Dis. 86:1404, 2002; published on-line as D-2002-1015-01N, 2002.
Accepted for publication 30 September 2002.
In April 2001, reduced leaf size, leaf curling, yellowing symptoms, and
reduced yield were observed in tomato (_Lycopersicon esculentum_ ) plants
in the southwestern (Toliary, Morondava, Miandrivazo) and northern
(Antsiranana) regions of Madagascar. Symptoms were similar to those caused
by Tomato yellow leaf curl begomovirus (TYLCV).
Large populations of _Bemisia tabaci_ (Gennadius) were observed colonizing
tomato, other crops, and weeds. Leaf samples were collected from tomato
plants from 14 sites located in northern, central, and southern Madagascar.
2 plant samples collected near Antsiranana, 1 sample near Morondava, and 1
sample near Toliary were positive in TAS-ELISA using a begomovirus-specific
antibody (ADGEN, Nellies Gates, Auchincruive, Scotland, UK).
A 500-bp product was amplified and cloned (2) from 2 leaf samples collected
near Toliary and 1 near Morondava using a pair of degenerate primers that
awere expected to amplify a region of the A component of begomoviruses
between the intergenic conserved nonanucleotide sequence and the first 200
nucleotides of the coat protein ORF.
Sequences corresponding to the 2 Toliary samples (GenBank Accession Nos.
[GBAN] AJ422123 and AJ422124) and the Morondava sample (GBAN AJ422125)
showed the most significant alignments (NCBI, BLAST) with begomoviruses,
Tobacco leaf curl virus (Zimbabwe) (GBAN AF 350330) and Tomato leaf curl
virus (Tanzania) (GBAN U73498) with 76 to 77 percent nucleotide identity
(Clustal method, MegAlign, DNASTAR, London) and South African cassava
mosaic viruses (SACMV GBAN AJ422132 and AF155806) and East African cassava
mosaic viruses (Malawi) (GBAN AJ006459 and AJ006460) with 74 to 75.5
percent nucleotide identity.
The low nucleotide identity suggests that the Madagascar tomato begomovirus
is a new species. Since the core region of the coat protein gene is a
molecular marker for provisional classification of begomoviruses (1), this
region was amplified for the Morondava isolate with degenerate primers. The
519nt core fragment obtained showed the most significant alignments with
SACMV (GBAN AF329227), Cassava geminivirus (Mozambique) (GBAN AF329240),
and with TYLCV (GBAN AB014346 and AF105975) with 81 to 82 percent
nucleotide identity.
According to current taxonomic criteria (4), the Madagascar begomovirus,
provisionally named Tomato yellow leaf curl Morondava virus (TYLCMV), is
new and related to begomoviruses from southern Africa and to TYLCV. Tomato
yellow leaf curl disease was previously described in Madagascar by Reckhaus
(3) who presumed that it was caused by TYLCV. However, TYLCV was not
detected in the TYLCMV-infected samples that were assayed.

[It is not unexpected that a new tomato infecting begomovirus should
appear. The interactions between begomoviruses, their whitefly vectors and
host plants are ideal for evolution of new viral species. The fact that
symptoms induced by the Madagascar virus and TYLCV in tomato are similar
means that appropriate diagnostic methods will have to be used to
distinguish the two viruses. -Mod.DH]
