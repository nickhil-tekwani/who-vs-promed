Q FEVER, HUMAN, SHEEP, VACCINE - GERMANY: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

In a section of the State of Hesse in the middle of Germany (in the counties
Lahn-Dill, Waldeck Frankenberg, & Marburg Biedenkopf) we have had several
outbreaks of Q fever. Around 100 people have been symptomatically infected
in every outbreak during recent years. In the outbreak that is still
ongoing, a 35-year-old has died, one person now has a chronic infection, and
about 40 people have been hospitalised with pneumonia, hepatitis, or
endocarditis. As of today, a total of 72 cases have been registered.
I am in urgent need of information about vaccination programmes for sheep,
to reduce the risk of Q fever infection for humans in this endemic region.
In this region there is a large sheep population of about 50 000. All the
outbreaks could be linked to infected sheep. There is a high percentage of
sheep that have tested serologically positive (about 30 percent).
The normal measures alone [seem not to have reduced] the risk (we have
ordered in-house lambings, adequate disposal of the placenta and of other
contaminated materials, and controlled movement of sheep). We have an
ongoing study about ticks; it appears that in that region _Dermacentor
marginalis_ is not present.
We are currently considering the possibility of vaccinating the sheep. Hence
my question:
Does anybody have experience with the vaccine (there is one in France) and
vaccination of sheep, and does anybody know whether vaccination of sheep
that have tested serologically positive is a problem?

[Inactivated vaccines against Q fever have been used to vaccinate sheep,
goats, & cattle in several countries. The sheep vaccine may be combined with
other antigens, particularly with chlamydial antigen, to provide a
polyvalent vaccine, since the aetiological agent, _Coxiella burnetii_, is
known to induce abortions. Details on the vaccine, its manufacture,
testing, and use may be found in OIE's Manual of standards Diagnostic Tests
and Vaccines 2000, Chapter X.3:
<http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00113.htm>
The vaccination protocol usually consists of one subcutaneous injection in a
non-pregnant animal, preferably 15 days before insemination or mating. In a
heavily infected environment, a second inoculation may be given a month
later. In general, the clinical efficacy of vaccination has been recognised,
but it is less effective in preventing excretion of the organism in milk
(Durand J.L.,1993. La fievre Q. Epidemiologie et prophylaxie humaine et
animale. Bull. Soc. Vet. Prat. de France, 77, 269-297). Vaccination failure
has been observed among sheep and goats. In an infected environment, annual
revaccination is recommended.
The correlation between positive serology in sheep and clinical cases in
humans is not always an indication of an aetiological connection. Milk-borne
infection is also a factor to be considered.
Readers with recent experience on the issue, especially regarding
commercially available vaccines, are welcome to send their comments. -
