Potatoes cultivated in Kalikot district, Karnali province [prev. Province 6] have been destroyed by late blight disease. All potato plants on farms of more than one hectare have been completely destroyed, but others were unaffected. Local agriculture officers carried out diagnosis and monitoring. They said that fungicides were not used correctly and have started the procedures to control the disease.

[Late blight of potato (PLB) and tomato is caused by the fungus-like organism (oomycete) _Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100% crop loss. The pathogen can also affect some other solanaceous crops. In potato, it affects leaves as well as tubers; in tomato, it causes lesions and rotting of leaves, stems, and fruits. The disease is favoured by cool, moist conditions. It can spread rapidly within a crop and destroy it within a few days. Under favourable conditions, epidemics in tomatoes may be even more rapid than in potatoes.

The pathogen is spread by plant material (including potato seed tubers, tomato transplants, plant debris, volunteer crop plants), mechanical means (including human and insect activities), wind, and water. Disease management requires an integrated approach and may include removal of pathogen reservoirs, crop rotation, preventative fungicide treatments of planting material, as well as fungicide sprays of crops. Farm-saved or uncertified seed tubers have often been reported as sources of PLB outbreaks. Certified clean planting stock and management strategies for fungicide resistance of the pathogen are considered vital to control late blight outbreaks. Commercial crop cultivars vary in susceptibility to late blight. Development of resistant cultivars is being counteracted by the adaptability of the pathogen.

Late blight is considered an increasing problem worldwide. Considerable variation in aggressiveness between different pathogen strains has been observed, but more virulent strains are emerging frequently. The presence of both A1 and A2 mating types of the pathogen increases the chances of strains with additional fungicide resistances and increased yield losses developing. In Europe, regional differences in pathogen population diversity no longer exist; increasingly virulent strains have been reported to emerge mainly on potato (see previous ProMED posts in the archives), but recently also on tomato (ProMED post 20180611.5850443).
