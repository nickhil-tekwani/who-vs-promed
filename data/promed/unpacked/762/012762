2 Australian travelers who have recently returned to Brisbane from
Sibu Island off the east coast of Malaysia have been diagnosed with
chikungunya virus infection. Dr. Susan Vlack from Moreton Bay Public
Health Unit said that the 56-year-old woman and her 53-year-old male
companion fell ill within 5 days of arriving in Sibu, Johor province
for a holiday. Both were exposed to mosquito bites and contracted
similar symptoms of fever, joint pain and rash. The diagnosis of both
cases was confirmed by a real-time TaqMan RT-PCR assay developed at
the Public Health Virology Laboratory, QHFSS, Coopers Plains,
Brisbane. A microsphere immunoassay also developed in the same
laboratory detected specific anti-chikungunya IgM antibodies in the
serum of the female patient.

Viral RNA recovered from patient serum was further analyzed by RT-PCR
and nucleotide sequencing. Results indicate that the partial E1 gene
sequence obtained from the imported Malaysian strain was 100 percent
homologous with previous Indian and Italian 2007 imported strains and
contained one nucleotide difference compared to 2006 strains from
Mauritius and Reunion Island.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Pyke for this report confirming chikungunya virus
transmission on Sibu Island and providing information on the
relationship of the virus acquired by the travelers to chikungunya
virus isolates from other locations. This is another illustration of
how rapid international transportation can move infected individuals
to distant sites. Sibu Island is off the coast of Johor state,
peninsular Malaysia. Johor state has reported chikungunya cases
earlier this year (2008) (see ProMED archive no. 20080628.1992). As a
resort destination, Sibu Island may be adversely affected by a
chikungunya outbreak, should it intensify.
