Three "illegal pigs" [see comment], of the 170 slaughtered at the end of November [2021] in the Talana countryside as part of the actions to combat African swine fever (ASF) ordered by the project unit, were found to be seropositive -- small numbers, especially if compared to the latest killings that did not register cases of serological and virological positivity, but enough to decree the existence of an outbreak.

"The official status" -- declares Antonio Montisci, director of the regional service of public veterinary health and food safety -- "will arrive today [10 Dec 2021] on the basis of the provisions of the European regulation of last April [2021], much more restrictive than the previous one. The new provisions provide that in the presence of 2 seropositive animals, an outbreak is declared."

This news will not affect the report of the inspectors of Brussels who visited Sardinia from 9 to 19 Nov 2021 for an audit on what has been done in recent years to eradicate the disease that has afflicted the Sardinian pig sector for 43 years.

The European delegation, led by the Greek Milos Junos and called to draw up a report, acknowledged that the activities recently carried out in Sardinia have drastically reduced the number of illegal free-ranging pigs -- considered by experts to be the transmission belt of the virus between the wild population and domestic pigs. They reiterated the necessity to complete the actions to permanently eliminate the residual populations of such illegal pigs.

It is clear, therefore, that the presence of seropositive specimens in the heart of the red zone, between Ogliastra and Nuorese, cannot be underestimated and must lead to keeping one's guard up with the continuation of measures aimed at eradicating ASF.

The goal of lifting trade restrictions on meat and pork products seems close at hand, also by virtue of the fact that the last outbreak found in a farm dates back to 2018, in a farm of Mamoiada. The project's application is being continued.

[Talana is a town and commune in the province of Nuoro, east Sardinia, Italy (see map at <tinyurl.com/bdfm8772>).

ASF arrived in the south of Sardinia in 1978, probably due to administration of introduced contaminated swill. ASF virus genotype I, the last remnant of a large epidemical wave that affected Europe and America from '50 to '90s, is still circulating in an endemic area in the central-east part of the island. The disease has hampered the development of a modern pig farming in Sardinia.

Illegal free-ranging pigs, to which the above media report relates, are animals kept permanently outdoors, not fenced, with unlimited access to fields, pastures, forest or woodlands, without buildings or shelters, without an official and clearly defined ownership or registration in the National Italian Database (BDN).

Italy's most recent EC presentation on the ASF situation and control activities in Sardinia (July 2021) is available at https://ec.europa.eu/food/system/files/2021-07/reg-com_ahw_20210713_asf_ita.pdf. - Mod.AS
