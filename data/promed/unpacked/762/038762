>>I believe in a later extension to the study (but can't recall the
reference), those who had become infected in this earlier phase then could
only be infected subsequently by exposure to higher doses, supporting the
widely held view that infection or exposure to oocysts imparts a degree of
immunity or at least resistance to further infection. <<

Healthy adults are susceptible to infection with small numbers of
_Cryptosporidium parvum_ oocysts, resulting in self-limited infection. We
investigated if infection of humans with _C. parvum_ is protective 1 year
after primary exposure. At 1 year after a primary challenge with 30 to 10(6)
oocysts, 19 healthy immunocompetent adults were rechallenged with 500
oocysts and monitored for the development of infection and/or illness.
Oocyst excretion was quantitated by direct immunofluorescence with a C.
parvum-specific monoclonal antibody, and anti-C. parvum antibodies in serum
were detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Fewer subjects shed
oocysts after the second exposure (3 of 19; 16%) than after the first
exposure (12 of 19; 63%) (P <
0.005). Although the rates of diarrhea were comparable after each of the two
exposures, the clinical severity as determined by the mean number of
unformed stools passed was lower after reexposure (11.25 versus 8.62; P <
0.05). The number of anti-Cryptosporidium immunoglobulin G and A
seroconversions increased after secondary exposure. However, the _C. parvum_
serum antibody response did not correlate with the presence or absence of
infection.

infectivity of Cryptosporidium parvum in healthy volunteers, N Engl J Med
1995 Mar 30;332(13):855-859
University of Texas Medical School, Houston.
BACKGROUND. Small numbers of _Cryptosporidium parvum_ oocysts can
contaminate even treated drinking water, and ingestion of oocysts can cause
diarrheal disease in normal as well as immunocompromised hosts. Since the
number of organisms necessary to cause infection in humans is unknown, we
performed a study to determine the infective dose of the parasite in healthy
adults.
METHODS. After providing informed consent, 29 healthy volunteers without
evidence of previous C. parvum infection, as determined by the absence of
anti - cryptosporidium - specific antibodies, were given a single dose of 30
to 1 million _C. parvum_ oocysts obtained from a calf. They were then
monitored for oocyst excretion and clinical illness for eight weeks.
Household contacts were monitored for secondary spread.
RESULTS. Of the 16 subjects who received an intended dose of 300 or more
oocysts, 14 (88 percent) became infected. After a dose of 30 oocysts, one of
five subjects (20 percent) became infected, whereas at a dose of 1000 or
more oocysts, seven of seven became infected. The median infective dose,
calculated by linear regression, was 132 oocysts. Of the 18 subjects who
excreted oocysts after the challenge dose, 11 had enteric symptoms and 7 (39
percent) had clinical cryptosporidiosis, consisting of diarrhea plus at
least one other enteric symptom. All recovered, and there were no secondary
cases of diarrhea among household contacts.
CONCLUSIONS. In healthy adults with no serologic evidence of past infection
with _C. parvum_, a low dose of _C. parvum_ oocysts is sufficient to cause
infection.
