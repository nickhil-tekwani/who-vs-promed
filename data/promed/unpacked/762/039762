U.S. Says Anthrax Found at Kazakhstan Facility
----------------------------------------------
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - American inspectors found anthrax at a Soviet-era
biological weapons facility in Kazakhstan during a routine inspection this
week, a U.S. official said on Friday. "It was a routine inspection under
the joint threat reduction program. None of them contracted the disease.
They are taking their medicine," said the official, who asked not to be
identified. The inspectors, working under government agreements meant to
decrease the threat of proliferation of biological weapons, carry out their
work fully protected so they are not in any danger, he said.
U.S. Defense officials said the United States has helped fund a
threat-reduction program at Kazakhstan's Vozroshdeniye Island in the Aral
Sea where the Soviet Union had a bioweapons station and reportedly
experimented with anthrax. Experts fear that some of the anthrax made in
former Soviet facilities may have found its way to criminals or extremist
groups.
It was not immediately known whether this week's inspection, which was
arranged some time ago, took place at Vozroshdeniye Island. The U.S.
official said the anthrax was found in the last 3 days.
A report on the Russian Interfax news agency last summer said that said a
dozen people had been treated in hospital with anthrax in Kazakhstan, but
gave few details.

[There was a major Soviet anthrax brewing plant in Kazakhstan during the
Biopreparat programme that was separate and well distant from the testing
facility on Vozroshdeniye Island, where a very large volume of
bioweapon-fill was dumped with a modicum of disinfectant. ProMED-mail has
had regular reports of human anthrax cases in Kazakhstan, which are mostly
in southern Kazakhstan, distant from the above facilities. - Mod.MHJ
