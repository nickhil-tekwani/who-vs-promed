[1] Latest morbidity and mortality
Date: Thu 25 Nov 2010

The death toll from Haiti's cholera epidemic rose to 1523 on Thursday [25
Nov 2010], up from 1415 over 2 days, officials said. The outbreak has sent
27 933 people into hospitals for treatment in just over a month.

To date, 140 have died of the virulent diarrheal disease in the destroyed
capital of Port-au-Prince, where more than a million people are living in
sprawling tent cities since a January 2010 earthquake. Officials fear the
disease could spread quickly there because residents have little access to
proper sanitation.

Cholera in Haiti
----------------
As of 20 Nov 2010, the Haitian Ministry of Public Health and Population
(MSPP) had reported 60 240 cumulative cholera cases including 1415 deaths
at the national level. The case fatality rate in hospitals at the national
level is 2.3 per cent, with 67 per cent of the deaths occurring at health
services level and 33 per cent at community level.

In Port-au-Prince and metropolitan area (Carrefour, Cite Soleil, Delmas,
Kenscoff, Petion Ville, Tabarre, and Croix des Bouquets), 5778 cases,
including 95 deaths have been reported.

On 19 Nov 2010, the Ministry of Health of the Dominican Republic reported 2
cases tested positive for cholera. One person is hospitalized and the other
is receiving treatment at his residence in the province of Santo Domingo.

WHO/PAHO and partners, including the GOARN (Global Outbreak Alert and
Response Network) continue to support the Haitian MSPP in the response to
the outbreak. Civil unrest since 15 Nov 2010 has slowed down several
activities, including delivery of supplies for prevention and treatment of
patients, particularly in the Northern city of Cap Haitian. Trainings on
cholera treatment and initiatives to chlorinate water for 300 000 people
had to be postponed.

The National Cholera Response Plan identifies the need to urgently scale-up
Oral Rehydration Centres at the community level to provide services to
non-life threatening cases and serve as a contact point for referring non
severe patients to Cholera Treatment Units (CTUs) and severe patients to
Cholera Treatment Centres (CTCs). The plan states the essential need to
scale-up CTUs, which are attached to or near existing health centres, to
provide essential treatment and triage patients with severe symptoms to
CTCs. Nationwide, CTCs with a total capacity of 2830 beds have been
established in Haiti.

WHO does not recommend restrictions to international travel or trade due to
the cholera outbreak in Haiti. For further information, please refer to the
"WHO statement relating to international travel and trade to and from
countries experiencing outbreaks of cholera" below.
