Respiratory Illness Kills 11 in Sudan
---------------------------------------------------
At least 11 people in central Sudan have died, and more than 16 000
have been hospitalized with a respiratory illness doctors link to an
annual locust invasion, the country's official news agency said Sat,
1 Nov 2003.
The peak was reported a week ago when some 500 cases were admitted to
a hospital in Medani, Sudan's second-largest city, 112 miles south of
Khartoum.
"The cases of asthma increased as of 22 Oct 2003 in an average that
exceeded the normal rate, a matter we considered an epidemic for
patients suffering from asthma," the local government said in a
statement carried by the news agency.
This is the first such outbreak of respiratory illness in the area.
A spokesman for the World Health Organization, Dick Thompson, told
The Associated Press that infectious disease experts at the
Geneva-based U.N. health agency were unaware of the outbreak, but
said the occurrence of such a "toxic event" could not be ruled out.
Abdel Moneim Hassan Khalifa, an agricultural official in the Medani
area, was quoted in the Sat 1 Nov 2003 al-Rai al-Amm newspaper as
saying the illness is linked to a hormone released by the dark-red
locusts during mating season -- which "has a strong effect on people
with asthma."
The committee has provided medication, oxygen, and equipment for
patients. The area has been sprayed with insecticide since last week,
and the numbers of deaths and infections have dropped, the statement
said.

[The posting calls the episodes 'lung eczema,' which is most likely
allergic asthma. The outbreak seems quite large to be due to asthma
in sensitized individuals, but the endemicity of the locust in this
area makes the large cluster possible. The following 2 abstracts
illustrate, however, the allergic potential of locusts and their
source of the allergens:
Burge PS, Edge G, O'Brien IM, et al: Occupational asthma in a
research centre breeding locusts. Clin Allergy 1980;10:355-63.
Abstract:
The prevalence of work-related asthma, rhinitis and urticaria was
measured in a scientific establishment working with locusts. 26
percent of those handling the locust in the research centre had
work-related wheeze or breathlessness, and one-third had work-related
rhinitis and urticaria. Work-related symptoms were uncommon in
scientists exposed to locusts in the field, and in other employees at
the centre. Antigens were prepared from the locusts, _Schistocerca
gregaria_ (the desert locust) and _Locusta migratoria_ (the migratory
locust), as well as the moth, _Chilo partellus_, which was also bred
at the centre. Skin prick testing with the locust antigens showed
positive reactions in 55 percent of the atopic workers at the centre,
but were also present in 43 percent of unexposed atopic workers. In
this latter group there was a correlation between positive reaction
to locust and dermatophagoides antigens. Atopic workers handling the
locusts developed occupational asthma more often and more quickly
than similarly exposed non-atopic workers. IgG and IgE antibodies to
the locust antigens were found to correlate significantly with both
the degree of exposure and the presence of disease.
Tee RD, Gordon DJ, Hawkins ER, et al: Occupational allergy to
locusts: an investigation of the sources of the allergen. J Allergy
Clin Immunol 1988;81:517-25.
Abstract:
Allergic symptoms occur commonly in subjects working closely with
locusts and are associated with specific IgE antibody. Extracts of
intact locusts (_Schistocerca gregaria_ and _Locusta migratoria_)
were used to identify specific IgE antibody, to define the major
allergens of the locust and their sources, and to estimate
aeroallergen concentration in the working environment. With
questionnaire, skin prick tests, and specific IgE measurements, 35
individuals, working in a research center, were surveyed. Of the 15
currently exposed individuals, contact with locusts provoked asthma,
rhinitis, and contact urticaria in 5, rhinitis and urticaria in 3,
and rhinitis alone in 1 individual. Symptoms provoked by locusts and
skin test reactions to locust extracts were associated with specific
IgE antibody in the serum. The "immunoblot" technique demonstrated
the presence of multiple allergens in the locust extracts of
approximately 68, 66, 54, 43, 37, 29, and 18 K daltons molecular
weight. Locust antigen was identified in the atmosphere by means of
an immunochemical method involving elution of high-volume air-sampler
filters exposed in the locust breeding room and analysis of eluate
allergen content by RAST-inhibition assays. Logit transformation of
RAST-inhibition lines demonstrated that the filter extract shared a
common slope with the locust extract and with an extract of locust
gut. This gut extract also shared a common slope with extracts of
locust feces and peritrophic membrane. The major source of allergen
appears to be the peritrophic membrane that is present in the gut and
is excreted surrounding the feces.
ProMED-mail would welcome additional information concerning this
outbreak. - Mod.LL]
