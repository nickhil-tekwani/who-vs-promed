The chief of the Health Ministry's disease management center says the
cause of the disease that has claimed 7 lives [in Sistan and
Baluchestan province], in southeast Iran, is still unknown.
Mohammad-Mehdi Guya told Iran's Fars news agency that at this point
in time the cause of the disease was still unknown to authorities
[and that he would be traveling to the region to monitor the situation.]
The deadly disease has claimed the lives of 7 people in Khash and
Sarvan. Guya noted that the symptoms of the disease, which include
fever, sore throat, inflammation of the lymph glands, and general
pain, could be the symptoms of a series of different illnesses, but
emphasized that [both] cholera and the H5N1 bird flu virus have been ruled out.

[A fatal disease with a symptom complex associated with fever, sore
throat, lymph node swelling, and myalgia is certainly not likely to
be cholera or H5N1 influenza. With 7 deaths, it is important to know
how many cases occurred overall to assess a case-fatality rate (CFR).
A CFR of 1 percent would suggest different diagnoses than a CFR of
close to 100 percent. Among diseases to be considered would be Group
A streptococcal disease and oropharyngeal tularemia as lower CFR
diseases and pharyngeal plague and gastrointestinal anthrax involving
the throat as high CFR ones.
Sistan-Baluchestan province is located in extreme southeastern Iran
as can be seen on the map at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistan_and_Baluchistan_Province>. The
province comprises 2 sections, Sistan in the north and Baluchestan in
the south. The combined Sistan and Baluchestan province today
accounts for one of the driest regions of Iran. - Mod.LL]
