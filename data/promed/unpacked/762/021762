Abstract
--------
Several vaccine candidates to protect against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have entered or will soon enter large-scale, phase 3, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials. To facilitate harmonized evaluation and comparison of the efficacy of these vaccines, a general set of clinical endpoints is proposed, along with considerations to guide the selection of the primary endpoints on the basis of clinical and statistical reasoning. The plausibility that vaccine protection against symptomatic COVID-19 could be accompanied by a shift toward more SARS-CoV-2 infections that are asymptomatic is highlighted, as well as the potential implications of such a shift.

We address 4 salient issues on study endpoints in COVID-19 vaccine efficacy trials. First, we propose a general set of clinical endpoints to facilitate a harmonized evaluation and comparison of the efficacy of vaccine candidates, overall and across relevant subgroups.
Second, we consider the pros and cons of various endpoints for use as primary endpoints.
Third, we recommend adequate follow-up of all participants to enable enhanced sensitivity regarding effects on severe COVID-19 as well as assessment of the longer-term vaccine effect on the set of endpoints, including an assessment of durability of protection.
Fourth, we recommend including asymptomatic infection as a study endpoint, given that vaccine protection against COVID-19 could be accompanied by a shift toward more asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, a plausible outcome if the vaccine does not confer sterilizing immunity.

Longer-term follow-up as defined earlier would also provide important information on duration of the vaccine effect on each of the endpoints.

Conclusion
----------
A primary endpoint should be clinically meaningful (27), sensitive, and specific. A simple designation, such as reducing COVID-19 disease severity, seems uncomplicated, but it masks potential interpretability and misclassification concerns. The COVID-19, severe COVID-19, and BOD [burden of disease] endpoints depend on sets of prescribed symptoms, and myriad definitions could be used to specify these sets. Although the FDA recommends defining the COVID-19 endpoint as virologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection accompanied by 1 or more of 11 symptoms, trialists have latitude to select particular symptoms and severities needed to trigger virologic testing. It is important to define a common COVID-19 endpoint that can be used consistently across trials, both for interpretation of results and for facilitation of meta-analyses of trials.

Because several candidate COVID-19 vaccines are entering phase 3 testing, it is important to adopt a standard set of clinical endpoints for vaccine efficacy evaluation across all of the trials to provide uniform, comprehensive evaluations of benefit and risk, and to support pooling data for analyses of immunologic surrogate endpoints. We have proposed a core set of primary and secondary clinical endpoints. The designation of endpoints as primary versus secondary may differ by vaccine candidate because some may have a greater preevaluation probability of blocking SARS-CoV-2 acquisition, which could justify including infection as a primary endpoint. Regardless, we propose that COVID-19 and severe COVID-19 should be important standalone clinical endpoints to assess in every vaccine efficacy trial, with adequate follow-up of all participants to accumulate meaningful data for assessment of longer-term protection against both endpoints, especially severe COVID-19, which needs greater endpoint counts for a reliable quantification of vaccine efficacy. Moreover, we have noted reasons for considering the BOD [burden of disease] endpoint as a (dual) primary or key secondary endpoint if the vaccine candidate is expected to work best against severe COVID-19 and at an intermediate level against nonsevere COVID-19. In such scenarios, the BOD endpoint will provide improved power relative to COVID-19, although this gain may be offset by a potential detriment in clinical interpretability associated with this composite endpoint. Finally, given that a desired, vaccine-induced decrease in the incidence of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections may be accompanied by a shift toward more asymptomatic infections, we recommend including the ability to evaluate vaccine efficacy against the asymptomatic infection endpoint in trial designs.

[This paper addresses a very important issue, namely the establishment and standardization of a set of clinical endpoints in order to be able to compare efficacy of vaccines being tested. The authors discuss post-vaccination infection with SARS-CoV-2 and disease (COVID-19), both non-severe and severe, as well as asymptomatic. Burden of disease (BOD) is also an important measure of efficacy. It is more difficult to standardize as it cannot be expressed as a "percentage reduction in the risk for becoming an endpoint "case". It is not clear how to quantitate the BOD, that is, how would the score relate to the corresponding increment in clinical significance?

It is unlikely that a vaccine will lead to sterilizing immunity, but a "vaccine that protects against disease and confers limited protection against infection would still provide great clinical benefit and overall utility." Serologic assays will need to be conducted to evaluate whether protection against infection has occurred. Antibody produced in response to natural infection as compared to the vaccine can be distinguished by serologic assays which "accurately detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibodies elicited by naturally acquired infection but not by SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-based vaccination, providing the technology required to enable evaluation of efficacy against the infection endpoint."

The vaccine may drive the disease spectrum towards asymptomatic infection. It is not clear what the consequence of this will be since if viral shedding occurs in asymptomatic cases and the virus is transmissible; this may increase the spread of virus in the population. On the other hand, if asymptomatic individuals are not infectious, the vaccine will be successful in decreasing the BOD and virus transmission.

The need for longer term follow-up (1 year) of the immunized individuals is raised by the authors. This is critical because of the question of waning immunity. But waning antibody may not be synonymous with waning immunity. Even in the case of diminished levels of detectable antibody, memory B cells and T cells may provide protection should an individual become infected. Longer term studies will be informative on waning vaccine efficacy against a clinical endpoint, and they will allow determination of antibody dependent disease enhancement.

The paper, available at the source URL above, is recommended reading for a full discussion of this issue of standardization of criteria for vaccine evaluation. - Mod.LK]

[2] Winter impact on transmission
Date: Wed 21 Oct 2020

COVID-19's wintry mix: As we move indoors, dry air will help the coronavirus spread
It's not just the cold, it's the humidity.

Winter in the northern United States will soon drive even the most diehard outdoor diners and backyard socializers indoors, bringing with them heightened risk for contracting and spreading COVID-19. The worry is not just that people might mingle more closely inside, but that the air they breathe will make the virus more dangerous. Cold, dry air facilitates the spread of the coronavirus, and the social distancing that helped outside won't be as effective indoors, scientists said.

"I do worry about this pandemic potentially getting worse this winter," Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at the Yale School of Medicine, told STAT. "All the same kind of concerns that usually apply to other respiratory infections are the same with this virus."

The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 will thrive this winter for 3 reasons: dropping temperatures, diving relative humidity, and drier respiratory tracts. When the weather turns cold, air gets drier. And turning on the heat dries both the air and the tissues lining the airways, impairing how well mucus removes debris and invaders like SARS-CoV-2.

Studies show significantly more infections happen and spread when the relative humidity falls from between 40% and 60% -- a range typical in warmer weather -- to 20%. That research draws from past outbreaks of flu and MERS, which is caused by another coronavirus. More recent case reports from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic's early days in China and Seattle conclude the same thing: The virus stays stable longer and finds purchase on receptors in our airways better when the relative humidity sits at a wintry 20%. That's one reason why we catch more colds and flu in cold weather.

Limiting the number of people in a confined space, wearing a mask, and ensuring good ventilation can help reduce the risk of infection indoors. But still, the viral particles from an infected person are unlikely to just blow away, as they might outside on a windy day. Consequently, the admonition for people to stay 6 feet [2 m] apart may not be adequate in offices, schools, restaurants, and other indoor spaces, some scientists said. Even when social distancing outdoors, "6 feet is not magic," Iwasaki said.

Martin Bazant, professor of chemical engineering and mathematics at MIT, urges people to think "beyond 6 feet," which is how he and his colleague John Bush titled their paper posted to the preprint server medRxiv last month (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.26.20182824v1; see reference below). "It was recognized early on that so-called superspreading events, which invariably occur indoors among persons separated by more than 6 feet, can only be explained by airborne transmission," he said in an interview.

Models for indoor air assume that pathogens like the SARS-CoV-2 virus are distributed uniformly throughout indoor rooms. "In such well-mixed spaces, one is no safer from airborne pathogens at 60 feet than 6 feet," Bazant and Bush wrote.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued conflicting guidance. In September [2020], the agency changed the information on its website about airborne transmission of COVID-19, first saying it could be spread beyond 6 feet through droplets or small particles in aerosols produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, sings, talks, or breathes. 3 days later, CDC removed information about aerosols and distances greater than 6 feet, saying a draft guidance had been mistakenly posted.

A CDC scientific brief posted [5 Oct 2020] (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/scientific-brief-sars-cov-2.html) held to the 6-foot standard: "Available data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has spread more like most other common respiratory viruses, primarily through respiratory droplet transmission within a short range (such as less than 6 feet)." The agency also said it found no evidence of routine, rapid spread to people far away or who enter a space hours after an infectious person was there.

"Unfortunately, 10 months into the pandemic, public health agencies are still reluctant to acknowledge airborne transmission, let alone question the 6-foot rule. Official guidelines still focus on large-drop transmission in coughs and sneezes, where 6 feet is an arbitrary distance for those droplets to settle to the floor," Bazant said. "Aerosol transmission was previously implicated in the spread of SARS and measles with less evidence than we have now for COVID-19, so I am hopeful that change will come soon, as the scientific consensus grows."

Bazant and Bush, an expert on respiratory fluid mechanics, have created a guideline to gauge the risk of airborne transmission that takes into account factors such as exposure time, room size, ventilation, and human activity. They designed a spreadsheet and online app (http://web.mit.edu/bazant/www/COVID-19/) intended to be simple enough for public health agencies to endorse and the public to use. "Depending on ventilation, mask use, air filtration, and other variables, any indoor space may carry either low or high risk of transmission," Bazant said.

Local regulations may govern ventilation in public places, but they don't go far enough in the view of Yale's Iwasaki. She and others are urging the World Health Organization to add relative humidity to indoor-air standards for such public places as schools and nursing homes. "It's really to take action by setting the standard from 40-60% humidity because that's the optimal humidity for health and respiratory infection prevention," she said about the online petition.

Pending such a move, there's always the mask option indoors. Masks are more effective than ventilation or air filtration because they filter aerosols and large drops at their source, as a person emits them. That means either more people can safely be in a room together or they can safely spend more time there, compared to a space that has only ventilation or air filtration.

Hospital intensive care units typically have negative air pressure ventilation -- forcing out internal air -- to protect their extremely ill patients, but that's not necessarily the case for beds on regular floors, Iwasaki said, putting patients at risk.

Two other scientists have appealed to the medical community and public health bodies to provide more guidance about precautions for indoor spaces. "Handwashing and social distancing are appropriate but, in our view, insufficient to provide protection from virus-carrying respiratory microdroplets released into the air by infected people," Linda Morawska of Queensland University of Technology and Donald Milton of the University of Maryland School of Public Health wrote in Clinical Infectious Diseases (https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798).

"This problem is especially acute in indoor or enclosed environments, particularly those that are crowded and have inadequate ventilation relative to the number of occupants and extended exposure periods." Iwasaki advises people to buy humidifiers for their homes if they can. She has always told her children to bundle up with scarves over their noses when they go out in the winter, and she herself, back when she used to travel, always wore a mask on an airplane. She had 3 reasons: to prevent viruses from reaching her mouth and nose, to keep them warm, and to keep them moist.

"We don't know where this is going to end up -- we haven't had a year with it yet," she said about the pandemic. "I think we have to be extra cautious going into the winter."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Abstract
---------
"The revival of the global economy is being predicated on the Six-Foot Rule, a guideline that offers little protection from pathogen-bearing droplets sufficiently small to be continuously mixed through an indoor space. The importance of indoor, airborne transmission of COVID-19 is now widely recognized; nevertheless, no quantitative measures have been proposed to protect against it. In this article, we build upon models of airborne disease transmission in order to derive a safety guideline that would impose a precise upper bound on the cumulative exposure time, the product of the number of occupants, and their time in an enclosed space. We demonstrate the manner in which this bound depends on the ventilation rate and dimensions of the room; the breathing rate, respiratory activity, and face-mask use of its occupants; and the infectiousness of the respiratory aerosols, a disease-specific parameter that we estimate from available data. Case studies are presented, implications for contact tracing considered, and appropriate caveats enumerated."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On [11 Aug 2020], a confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a male correctional facility employee (correctional officer) aged 20 years was reported to the Vermont Department of Health (VDH). On [28 Jul 2020], the correctional officer had multiple brief encounters with 6 incarcerated or detained persons (IDPs)* while their SARS-CoV-2 test results were pending. The 6 asymptomatic IDPs arrived from an out-of-state correctional facility on [28 Jul 2020] and were housed in a quarantine unit. In accordance with Vermont Department of Corrections (VDOC) policy for state prisons, nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from the 6 IDPs on their arrival date and tested for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, at the Vermont Department of Health Laboratory, using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). On [29 Jul 2020], all 6 IDPs received positive test results. VDH and VDOC conducted a contact tracing investigation** and used video surveillance footage to determine that the correctional officer did not meet VDH's definition of close contact (that is, being within 6 feet [2 m] of infectious persons for greater than or equal to 15 consecutive minutes)***,****; therefore, he continued to work. At the end of his shift on [4 Aug 2020], he experienced loss of smell and taste, myalgia, runny nose, cough, shortness of breath, headache, loss of appetite, and gastrointestinal symptoms; beginning [5 Aug 2020], he stayed home from work. An [5 Aug 2020] nasopharyngeal specimen tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time RT-PCR at a commercial laboratory was reported as positive on [11 Aug 2020]; the correctional officer identified 2 contacts outside of work, neither of whom developed COVID-19. On [28 Jul 2020], 7 days preceding his illness onset, the correctional officer had multiple brief exposures to 6 IDPs who later tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; available data suggest that at least one of the asymptomatic IDPs transmitted SARS-CoV-2 during these brief encounters.

Subsequently, VDH and facility staff members reviewed [28 Jul 2020] quarantine unit video surveillance footage and standard correctional officer shift duty responsibilities to approximate the frequency and duration of interactions between the correctional officer and infectious IDPs during the work shift (Table: Description, frequency, and duration of close (within 6 ft) interactions between the ill correctional facility employee and six infectious incarcerated or detained persons (IDPs) while their SARS-CoV-2 test results were pending -- Vermont, [28 Jul 2020]* available at the source URL above). Although the correctional officer never spent 15 consecutive minutes within 6 feet of an IDP with COVID-19, numerous brief (approximately 1-minute) encounters that cumulatively exceeded 15 minutes did occur. During his 8-hour shift on [28 Jul 2020], the correctional officer was within 6 feet of an infectious IDP an estimated 22 times while the cell door was open, for an estimated 17 total minutes of cumulative exposure. IDPs wore microfiber cloth masks during most interactions with the correctional officer that occurred outside a cell; however, during several encounters in a cell doorway or in the recreation room, IDPs did not wear masks. During all interactions, the correctional officer wore a microfiber cloth mask, gown, and eye protection (goggles). The correctional officer wore gloves during most interactions. The correctional officer's cumulative exposure time is an informed estimate; additional interactions might have occurred that were missed during this investigation.

The correctional officer reported no other known close contact exposures to persons with COVID-19 outside work and no travel outside Vermont during the 14 days preceding illness onset. COVID-19 cumulative incidence in his county of residence and where the correctional facility is located was relatively low at the time of the investigation (20 cases per 100 000 persons), suggesting that his most likely exposures occurred in the correctional facility through multiple brief encounters (not initially considered to meet VDH's definition of close contact exposure) with IDPs who later received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result.

Among 7 employees with exposures to the infectious IDPs that did meet the VDH close contact definition, one person received a positive test result. Among 13 employees (including the correctional officer) with exposures to the infectious IDPs that did not meet the VDH close contact definition during contact tracing, only the correctional officer received a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result.

Data are limited to precisely define "close contact"; however, 15 minutes of close exposure is used as an operational definition for contact tracing investigations in many settings. Additional factors to consider when defining close contact include proximity, the duration of exposure, whether the infected person has symptoms, whether the infected person was likely to generate respiratory aerosols, and environmental factors such as adequacy of ventilation and crowding. A primary purpose of contact tracing is to identify persons with higher risk exposures and therefore higher probabilities of developing infection, which can guide decisions on quarantining and work restrictions. Although the initial assessment did not suggest that the officer had close contact exposures, detailed review of video footage identified that the cumulative duration of exposures exceeded 15 minutes. In correctional settings, frequent encounters of less than or equal to 6 feet between IDPs and facility staff members are necessary; public health officials should consider transmission-risk implications of cumulative exposure time within such settings.

[This MMWR report is an excellent segue from the report in section [2] above re winter's impact on disease transmission, adding more concerns/cautions to keep in mind with indoor exposures.

That being said, the CDC definition of a close contact has been changed to reflect what may have occurred in the incident above.

"Someone who was within 6 feet [2 m] of an infected person for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period* starting from 2 days before illness onset (or, for asymptomatic patients, 2 days prior to test specimen collection) until the time the patient is isolated.

* Individual exposures added together over a 24-hour period (for example, three 5-minute exposures for a total of 15 minutes). Data are limited, making it difficult to precisely define "close contact;" however, 15 cumulative minutes of exposure at a distance of 6 feet or less can be used as an operational definition for contact investigation. Factors to consider when defining close contact include proximity (closer distance likely increases exposure risk), the duration of exposure (longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk), whether the infected individual has symptoms (the period around onset of symptoms is associated with the highest levels of viral shedding), if the infected person was likely to generate respiratory aerosols (for example, was coughing, singing, shouting), and other environmental factors (crowding, adequacy of ventilation, whether exposure was indoors or outdoors). Because the general public has not received training on proper selection and use of respiratory PPE, such as an N95, the determination of close contact should generally be made irrespective of whether the contact was wearing respiratory PPE. At this time, differential determination of close contact for those using fabric face coverings is not recommended." (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/appendix.html#contact).

As I've said previously, every time we think we have "mastered" the SARS-CoV-2 and its presentation as COVID-19, the virus throws us another curve ball and shows us there is more to learn. - Mod.MPP]

- The Americas region reported 30.3% of daily case numbers and 45.5% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 19.0 million cases. The USA maintains its dominance, followed by Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Canada.

- The European region reported 45.7% of daily case numbers and 27.6% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 8.5 million. Countries not reporting cases today (22 Oct 2020) include Kazakhstan and Sweden. The UK is dominant, followed by France, Spain, Russia, Italy, Czech Republic, Germany, Poland, Netherlands, Ukraine, Switzerland, Romania, Portugal, Austria, Armenia, Slovakia, Hungary, and Turkey. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours include Georgia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Israel, and Ireland.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.8% of daily case numbers and 9.4% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 2.8 million cases. Iran is dominant, followed by Iraq, Morocco, Jordan, UAE, Tunisia, and Lebanon. Kuwait, Libya, Pakistan, and the Palestinian Authority each reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000 while Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen did not report any cases in the last 24 hours.

- The African region reported 1.1% of daily case numbers and 2.2% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.27 million cases. South Africa is dominant, followed by Ethiopia, Kenya, Angola, Algeria, Uganda, Mozambique, and Cabo Verde.

- The Western Pacific region reported 0.85% of daily case numbers and 1.2% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.69 million cases. As previously, the Philippines maintains its dominance, followed by Malaysia, Japan, French Polynesia, South Korea, Guam, and China.

- The South East Asia region reported 16.2% of the daily newly reported cases and 14.0% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 8.6 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Nepal, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.

Impression: There are now 24 countries in the European reporting more than 1000 new cases in 24 hours and 8 countries reporting more than 10 000 cases. The Americas region combined with the European region account for more than 3/4 of daily reported cases and almost ¾ of the global reported deaths in the past 24 hours.

[India and the USA are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India in the 2nd position in terms of cumulative case counts. In the past 24 hours, the USA (76 832) India (54 482) have maintained their dominance. A global total of 6322 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (21-22 Oct 2020).

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (18 countries) include the USA, India, Spain (43 880), France (41 622), Brazil (31 985), UK (21 238), Argentina (16 325), Italy (16 078), Russia (15 971), Czech Republic (14 150), Germany (12 519), Poland (12 107), Netherlands (9271), Colombia (8570), Ukraine (7053), Mexico (6612), Iran (5471), and Switzerland (5256). 12 countries reported more than 10 000 cases in the past 24 hours, 8 of which were in the European region. A total of 47 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 24 of the 47 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 9 were from the Americas region, 6 were from the Eastern Mediterranean region and 5 were from the South East Asia region.
