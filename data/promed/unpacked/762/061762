Kentucky officials say 3 deaths have now been reported in a hepatitis A outbreak in 6 counties. The number was released [Fri 20 Apr 2018], along with a total number of cases of 352, through last [Sat 14 Apr 2018]. The state Department of Public Health recommends hepatitis A vaccinations for children older than 1 year and adults living in Jefferson, Bullitt, Hardin, Greenup, Carter and Boyd counties.

Public Health Acting Commissioner Jeffrey Howard said in a news release that it is safe to travel to Kentucky and attend the [5 May 2018] Kentucky Derby. He said the CDC hasn't issued any travel restrictions or made any vaccination recommendations for travelers.

The Indiana State Department of Health said this week that residents should be vaccinated and protect themselves from hepatitis A when traveling to states experiencing outbreaks.

[3 deaths in 352 reported outbreak cases corresponds to a case fatality rate of under 1 percent; substantially lower than the larger outbreaks in southern California and southeastern Michigan. Certainly these outbreaks and parallel ones in other states such as the Utah outbreak have been concentrated in certain cohort groups such as the homeless and illicit drug users but cases have been reported in essentially all of these outbreaks in food handlers, which certainly has the potential to then spread to visitors including to the Derby or whatever in different states. Breaking the chain of transmission through food handlers requires HAV immunization of all food handlers which is not mandated. - Mod.LL]

The Kanawha-Charleston Health Department says that the recent cases of hepatitis A in Kanawha and Putnam counties are linked to an ongoing, multi-state hepatitis A outbreak. More than 20 cases of hepatitis A have been confirmed in Kanawha and Putnam counties since January 2018. Prior to this outbreak, Janet Briscoe, KCHD's director of epidemiology, called hepatitis A cases rare in the area.

KCHD says the specimens they submitted to the CDC match a specific genotype identified in the California and Kentucky outbreaks. They add that the multistate outbreak, for the most part, is occurring in people who use illicit drugs and who may be homeless or without a permanent residence. The disease spread may also be attributed to the lack of access to proper hygiene or sanitation.

KCHD officials are urging people with risk factors including the homeless and/or people who use injection and non-injection drugs, to get vaccinated. Anyone with ongoing, close contact with high-risk populations should consider vaccination.

Since [1 Jan 2017], the Utah Public Health has identified 243 confirmed cases of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection; many among persons who are homeless and/or using illicit drugs. Several cases have been linked by investigation and/or viral sequencing to a national outbreak of hepatitis A involving cases in California and Arizona. Hospitalization rates of less than 40 percent have been described in previous hepatitis A outbreaks; however, other jurisdictions associated with this outbreak are reporting case hospitalization rates approaching 70 percent. The high rate of hospitalization may be a result of cases having underlying illnesses (e.g., alcoholism), or a higher rate of hepatitis comorbidities (e.g., hepatitis B or C). In response to the outbreak, public health officials have been working to identify cases and contacts, provide education, and ensure opportunities for vaccination of close contacts to cases and vulnerable populations.

Hepatitis A is usually spread through having oral contact with items contaminated with hepatitis A, for example, through ingesting food or drinks contaminated by infected feces. Some people do not develop symptoms, even if infected. If symptoms occur, they usually appear anywhere from 2-6 weeks after exposure. Symptoms usually develop over a period of several days, and may include jaundice (the yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes), abdominal pain, nausea or diarrhea. Hepatitis A vaccination is the best way to prevent hepatitis A infection.

[It is interesting that so far in Utah there have been only 2 deaths (case fatality rate under 1 percent) whereas the large outbreaks in southern California and southeastern Michigan reported case fatality rates of 3-4 percent. The hospitalization rate in Utah while high is also substantially below the 70-80 percent rate in those other outbreaks.
