The finding of avian reovirus in dead corvids is not new. In 2002,
avian reovirus was isolated at the Animal Health Diagnostic Center at
Cornell from dead crows in the Washington DC area as well as the New
York City area. Given that this was in the midst of intense West Nile
virus (WNV) surveillance, no immediacy was placed on characterizing
the virus and no data were available to indicate the number of crows
that died in these outbreaks.
Attempts to localize the virus in infected tissue were not
successful, as reagents for this virus were not available. A recent
report (Huhtamo et al, Emerg Infect Dis 13:1967) described a similar
situation in Finland with the isolation of a reovirus from a corvid
in 2002.
Sequence analysis of the isolate supports consideration of this virus
a being a new species of avian reovirus. In all likelihood, the virus
from North America will belong to this same group, and sequence
analyses of the 2002 isolates are in progress to ascertain their
similarity.

[We are grateful for Dr. Dubovi's update on the status of this
reovirus. We will look forward to the sequencing results and how they
relate to other cases.
One cannot help but speculate that reoviruses have been present in
corvid populations in many geographic locations probably for a long
time. Since the West Nile virus outbreak in North America has
focused attention on corvids, it will be interesting to see whether
there will be increased detection of reoviruses in corvid populations
as a by-product of WNV surveillance. There are, without a doubt,
banks of bird sera collected for WNV studies, especially from crows
and jays, that might be tested for reovirus antibody. The need to
differentiate reovirus from WNV bird mortality during WNV
surveillance might justify the expense of reovirus serology and
sequencing. - Mods.TG/TMY]
