Health minister R. Ashok is planning to hold a meeting with his
counterparts from chikungunya-hit states to form a border task force
to contain transmission of the disease. "We are taking all efforts to
contain the disease. We need to coordinate with all bordering states
to reduce the density of mosquitoes."
The minister will also write to Union health minister Anbumani
Ramadoss seeking assistance. Earlier, Ashok chaired a meeting of
ministers, MLAs, MLCs, the mayor, corporate officials and officials
from the health department and civic agencies seeking suggestions on
how to combat chikungunya.
"We should involve voluntary organizations and create an awareness
program like we did for pulse polio. With the onset of the monsoon,
it's very important for the BMP to be on red alert." The suggestions
included eradication of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes at the source and
active fogging measures. The health centers, MLAs said, should be
equipped with allopathic and Indian medicines.
While health commissioner Basavaraju said involvement of voluntary
organizations in creating awareness and early identification should
be done, there were others who suggested involvement of nursing
students to spread awareness.

[It has proved extraordinarily difficult to control _Ae. aegypti_
through community action aimed at getting citizens to eliminate
breeding sites, except in Cuba -- and even there, the mosquito has
returned after many years absence. It will be very interesting to see
whether the efforts in Bangalore yield measurable results in
eliminating or reducing larval habitats in and around homes. - Mod.TY/JW]
