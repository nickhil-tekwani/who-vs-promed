Young people in Tayside have been hit with an outbreak of syphilis. NHS [National Health Service] Tayside has seen a surge in cases of the sexually transmitted infection among heterosexual people aged 15 to 25.

The number of cases currently stands at about 20 -- compared to a usual 3 or 4 -- and those affected pass on the disease to partners in unprotected sex about 50 percent of the time, leading to fears the problem could escalate. The health board has launched an investigation into potential sources of the outbreak, as well as increasing clinic hours for testing. And young people have been urged to get themselves tested in a bid to stop the spread of the disease.

Dr Graham Leslie, a consultant at NHS Tayside's Sexual and Reproductive Health Centre, said: "We have seen an increase in cases of syphilis, and a large proportion of the increase has been in a young heterosexual population, which is unusual. Usually in Tayside we might expect a handful, and this year [2013] we have had 3 or 4 times what we would normally. Over summer we saw a small number of cases that seemed slightly unusual. From autumn onwards, we have suddenly seen more and we are trying to deal with that now. We have seen it across Tayside and from a public health point of view the longer we take to pick up people who might be infected, the more who are affected. Whenever we see an increased number of cases we want to know where they came from and what we could be doing, so we look closely at the cases -- that is ongoing at the moment. We haven't pinpointed where it came in and we may not be able to."

If left untreated, syphilis can cause permanent damage to the brain, the nervous system, and also the heart. Symptoms, which include ulcers, disappear but the infection stays. The longer someone goes untreated the worse the syphilis can become. A simple blood test is all that is needed to diagnose it, while treatment is usually a course of antibiotics.

Dr Leslie said: "We have increased clinical capacity at the sexual health clinic and given easier access to testing. Information has gone out to other health professionals, such as GPs."

Young people are also being targeted for advice at The Corner Health, Information and Peer-led Services for Young People at Shore Terrace in Dundee. Fiona McGrath, who is a health services link leader at the centre, said: "We want to let as many people know so that they can continue to take care of their sexual health. The Corner is a really good 1st point of contact."

If you'd like to know more, visit http://www.cool2talk.org or http://www.sexualhealthtayside.org, or the Need Tay Know app. For information or testing, people can also visit The Corner 6 afternoons a week or the Linc clinic at Ninewells on Mondays and Thursdays between 4pm-6pm.

[The news release above reports a large increase in the number of cases of syphilis (50 cases) reported so far this year (2013), compared to the usual number reported annually (3 to 4 cases) in Tayside region, Scotland. Although not specified in the news release, presumably the cases are contagious forms of syphilis (primary, secondary, and early latent syphilis). With a population of about 400 000, the incidence rate for syphilis in 2013 in Tayside is 12.5 per 100 000, in contrast to the incidence rate of 5.8 per 100 000 population in 2012 for Scotland as a whole (http://www.hps.scot.nhs.uk/ewr/redirect.aspx?id=55318) and 5.6 per 100 000 population for England in 2011 (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20224). The Tayside cases are said to be occurring among heterosexual people aged 15-25 years of age. Some of this increase could be due to an increase in STI (sexually transmitted infections) screening, but the news release suggests that ongoing high levels of unsafe sexual behavior more likely are behind the rise in syphilis seen among these young people.

We are told these cases are occurring "across Tayside", but not told if any clusters of cases are occurring in any specific locales. For example, Tayside includes the cities of Perth and Dundee. The city of Dundee, the regional urban center, within 1 hour's drive for 400 000 people, has a significantly greater proportion of 20-24 year olds, being mainly students from across the UK and international locations who are attending the University of Dundee, the University of Abertay, and Dundee College (http://www.thpc.scot.nhs.uk/PDFs/HProtection/Tayside%20Joint%20Health%20Protection%20Plan%20v12%2027.05.10.pdf). We are not told if any of the cases of syphilis are occurring among these university students or are within their social network.

In contrast to the syphilis outbreak in Tayside in 2013 that is occurring among heterosexuals, the Health Protection Agency/Scotland reported that for Scotland as a whole 80 percent of the 205 cases of infectious syphilis in 2012 continue to occur among men who have sex with men (MSM) (http://www.hps.scot.nhs.uk/ewr/article.aspx). Only around 40 cases per year (37 in 2012) are acquired heterosexually.

Similarly, in England syphilis continues to be predominantly seen in MSM, with 75 percent (1955/2622) of the male cases being in this group in 2011. Almost a third (620/1955) of MSM diagnosed with syphilis had previously been diagnosed with HIV infection (Savage EJ, Marsh K, Duffell S, et al: Rapid increase in gonorrhoea and syphilis diagnoses in England in 2011. Euro Surveill. 2012; 17(29): pii=20224. Available at http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20224).

Tayside had been an administrative region in the eastern central lowlands of Scotland. In 1996, it was divided into the council areas of Perth and Kinross, Angus, and the City of Dundee; however, Tayside continues to have a joint health board.
