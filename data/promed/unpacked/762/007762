Minnesota officials are investigating a _Salmonella_ outbreak among patrons of a juice bar. Health officials believe additional people likely are part of the outbreak. A specific source from Nekter Juice Bar in Woodbury, MN, has not yet been pinpointed, but the Minnesota Health Department is reporting that all confirmed patients have infections from a specific variant of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Paratyphi B, meaning they were most likely sickened by the same source.

"Since many (patients with) salmonellosis do not seek healthcare and get tested, the number of ill people that are part of this outbreak is likely to be larger than the number of cases identified," health officials said. ". . . people who have symptoms of salmonellosis, but who have not yet sought healthcare, (need) to mention this outbreak to their provider if they seek healthcare."

As of today [9 Oct 2020], the investigators continue to interview patients in their attempts to identify a specific food or drink that was contaminated with the _Salmonella_. The outbreak patients became ill between 27 Aug 2020 and 21 Sep 2020. 2 cases have been hospitalized. All are recovering, according to state health officials.

"The investigation to date has found that the cases consumed a variety of menu items -- juices, smoothies, or bowls -- from NekterJuice Bar in Woodbury from mid-August to 20 Sep 2020. It is possible that infections in people who became ill after visiting the establishment more recently have not yet been detected," according to the state health department.

Nekter Juice Bar in Woodbury has cleaned, sanitized, and restocked ingredients, the health department reported.

Approximately 700-1000 _Salmonella_ infections are reported each year in Minnesota.
