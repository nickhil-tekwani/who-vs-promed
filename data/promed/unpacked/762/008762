Iris yellow spot virus on Onion in New Mexico

Onions are an important crop for New Mexico, with 7700 acres (3116
ha) harvested in the state in 2003 (3). In 2002, onions of several
cultivars were first noticed with diamond-shaped chlorotic or
bleached lesions on seed stalks or leaves, typical of those reported
for Iris yellow spot virus (IYSV). A more widespread survey of
breeding stocks and commercial onion fields revealed similar symptoms
on thrips-infested onions in Dona Ana and Rio Arriba counties.
Incidence of disease symptoms ranged from less than 0.5 to nearly 30 percent.

Symptomatic leaves were assayed for the presence of IYSV using
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Agdia, Elkhart, IN) and
antisera acquired from Agdia. Symptomatic leaves from breeding and
commercial fields tested positive for IYSV. The virus was transmitted
by _Thrips tabaci_ from symptomatic onions to 3 onion cvs. New
Mex Mesa, New Mex Vado, and New Mex Cryspy in growth chamber tests.

All 3 cultivars showed symptoms of IYSV and tested positive for the
disease using ELISA. However, New Mex Vado and New Mex Cryspy
cultivars each showed 24 percent infection (4 infected plants of 17
tested) compared with 59 percent infection (10 infected plants of 17
tested) for New Mex Mesa, suggesting that not all cultivars are
equally susceptible to the virus.

To our knowledge, this is the 1st report in onions in New Mexico of
IYSV, which has also been reported in the western United States in
Idaho, Oregon, Colorado, and Washington (1,2,4).

[Iris yellow spot tospovirus (IYSV) is transmitted by onion thrips (_Thrips
tabaci_) and has been reported from over 50 countries worldwide. Recommended
disease management options include removal of culled onions so as to reduce
sources of infection, reduction of plant stressors so that the crop has
sufficient soil and fertility, reduction of soil compaction and irrigation
stresses, and management of thrips populations by appropriate chemical
insecticides. Natural enemies, including predaceous mites, minute pirate
bugs, and lacewings, are often found feeding on thrips. These beneficial
insects are very susceptible to insecticidal sprays, however, and are thus
unlikely to be effective in biological control of insects in fields treated
with insecticides.
