The press service of the Republican Ministry of Emergencies reports
that a person died from skin anthrax in the village of Barpi. The
doctors report that the cause of death was progressive cardiac and
circulatory failure.

According to preliminary information, there are 4 people in the same
hospital with anthrax, and one of them died. The conditions of the 3
other patients are rated as mild. Specimens have been taken for
laboratory tests.

Additionally, there are 6 other patients in the city hospital at
Kochkorati. There were 475 contact persons, including 276 children,
around these cases. All are now under medical observation.

[There are thousands of anthrax burial grounds in the Republic, and
most of them are in the Chuyskiy, Jalalabad and Oshskiy regions. The
exact locations of most of them are unknown. There were 23 human
anthrax cases during the last year (2007), which is 1.3 times higher
than during 2006. - Mod.NP]

A total of 4 anthrax disease cases were officially registered in Osh
city on 10 Jul 2008, Jalallidin Gaybulin, the director of the
Republican Quarantine and Specially Dangerous Infection Centre, told
Trend News.

A total of 5 people were hospitalized on suspicion of anthrax in
Suzakski region, and one of these patients, a 78-year-old pensioner
and resident of Barp village council and Achi District, was
hospitalized with a provisional diagnosis of "skin anthrax on the
back surface of the left hand" on 9 Jul 2008. The patient died of
cardiovascular deficiency at 6:30 AM on 10 Jul 2008, despite measures
taken by medical workers. A diagnosis of anthrax is still being confirmed.

At present, anti-epidemic measures taken in regions where anthrax
diseases were registered are under the control of the government.

[These 2 accounts appear to relate to the same circumstances, but the
1st emphasizes cases in the oblast of Jalalabad and the 2nd in Osh.
Logically, there are 2 simultaneous outbreaks involving 4, 5, or 6
persons in the 2 neighboring oblasts. Both oblasts are notorious for
the frequency of livestock and human cases of anthrax, and part of
the problem is the severity of the situation in the enclosed
adjoining region of eastern Uzbekistan and the continuity of the 2
agricultural systems there. In spite of NP's remarks, the locations
of just under half the outbreaks in the past 50 years in Kyrgyzstan
are known and plotted, and a total of 1180 sites are registered; see
20071227.4154. This is thanks to the hard and excellent work of Dr.
Asankadyr Junushov and his staff in Bishkek. In spite of logistical
problems in the country, he has raised the national awareness of
anthrax and thus improved reporting and diagnosis.
