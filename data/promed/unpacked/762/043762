Alarm in Masindi District Over Ebola Fever Deaths
--------------------------------------------------
KAMPALA: Over 30 panic-stricken patients have fled Kiryandongo Hospital,
Masindi district, following the outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in the
area. Of the 73 patients admitted for different ailments, 33 had left the
hospital without permission, fearing to contract Ebola fever.
Ebola hemorrhagic fever was imported from Gulu to Masindi by a woman who
[absconded from Lacor hospital, where she had been admitted over a stomach
ailment. Ebola fever has killed 4 people in Masindi, all members of the
same family [i.e. the woman who fled from Lacor Hospital and her
relatives. The Masindi family of over 60 people kept the dead bodies for 3
days before burial. This family was of Kenyan origin. However, no new
deaths or cases were reported yesterday.
Dr. Henry Luwaga, the District Director of Health Services, said scouts in
Kiryandongo had identified some suspected cases. The chairman of the
District Ebola Task Force, Mr. John Majara, said the Ebola Treatment Centre
lacked water and sanitation facilities. But the chairman of the National
Ebola Task Force, Dr. Sam Okware, said bore-hole drilling facilities would
arrive at Kiryandongo Hospital today. Majara said 10 graves had been
prepared at the hospital for emergency, and a team has been trained on safe
burial. Health workers and experts from WHO, the US Centers for Disease
Control, and Medecins Sans Frontieres are monitoring another 150 people in
Kigumba who might have contracted Ebola at the funerals. Okware commented
that "in Gulu and Mbarara, the control is going on well but unfortunately
the outbreak in Masindi is giving us a lot of problems. Kigumba is a very
complex area. It has many nationalities and it is a very deprived area
without facilities and infrastructure."
Meanwhile, 7 Kenyans who participated in the burial of the Masindi Ebola
victims have returned to their country, triggering fears that they may have
contracted the deadly virus. [They are now under observation. - Mod.CP
