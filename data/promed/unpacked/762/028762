["Newcastle disease (ND) is caused by virulent strains of avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1) serotype of the genus _Avulavirus_ belonging to the subfamily _Paramyxovirinae_, family _Paramyxoviridae_.

"One of the most characteristic properties of different strains of ND virus (NDV) has been their great variation in pathogenicity for chickens. Strains of NDV have been grouped into five pathotypes on the basis of the clinical signs seen in infected chickens. These are:
1. Viscerotropic velogenic: a highly pathogenic form in which haemorrhagic intestinal lesions are frequently seen;
2. Neurotropic velogenic: a form that presents with high mortality, usually following respiratory and nervous signs;
3. Mesogenic: a form that presents with respiratory signs, occasional nervous signs, but low mortality;
4. Lentogenic or respiratory: a form that presents with mild or subclinical respiratory infection;
5. Asymptomatic: a form that usually consists of a subclinical enteric infection.

"The vast majority of bird species appear to be susceptible to infection with APMV-1 of both high and low virulence for chickens, although the clinical signs seen in infected birds vary widely and are dependent on factors such as: the virus, host species, age of host, infection with other organisms, environmental stress and immune status. In some circumstances infection with the extremely virulent viruses may result in sudden high mortality with comparatively few clinical signs. Thus, the clinical signs are variable and influenced by other factors so that none can be regarded as pathognomonic.

"The broad variation in virulence and clinical signs necessitates the careful definition of what constitutes ND for the purposes of trade, control measures and policies."

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, and references please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2013, Chapter 2.3.14 Newcastle disease (version adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2012); http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.14_NEWCASTLE_DIS.pdf

"Morbidity and mortality rates vary greatly depending on the virulence of the strain and susceptibility of the host. Lentogenic and mesogenic viruses usually kill few birds; in poultry, the mortality rate is approximately 10 percent for mesogenic strains and negligible with lentogenic strains. Concurrent illnesses may increase the severity of illness and result in a higher death rate. In contrast, velogenic isolates have morbidity and mortality rates up to 100 percent in unvaccinated chickens. The onset of disease is usually rapid, and the virus often spreads quickly, particularly in group-housed flocks. Some isolates can affect young birds more severely. Vaccinated poultry tend to have milder infections. In one epidemic mainly affecting vaccinated chickens, flock mortality rates were 30 percent to 90 percent."
(http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/newcastle_disease.pdf)

"NDV is a human pathogen and the most common sign of infection in humans is conjunctivitis that develops within 24 hours of NDV exposure to the eye. Reported infections have been non-life threatening and usually not debilitating for more than a day or two. The most frequently reported and best-substantiated clinical signs in human infections have been eye infections, usually consisting of unilateral or bilateral reddening, excessive lachrymation, edema of the eyelids, conjunctivitis and sub-conjunctival haemorrhage. Although the effect on the eye may be quite severe, infections are usually transient and the cornea is not affected. There is no evidence of human-to-human spread."
