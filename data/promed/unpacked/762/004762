The federal government has imposed a quarantine zone around a St. Catharines, Ont., farm where a strain of bird flu was discovered.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) said in a news release it has established an "Avian Influenza Control Zone" to control the movement of animals, products and equipment in the area to minimize the spread of the disease. "The boundary of the Avian Influenza Control Zone covers a 3-km radius from the single premises confirmed to be infected with avian influenza, located near St. Catharines, Ont.," the news release reads. "All premises located within this zone will be placed under quarantine; however, only the initial infected premises has confirmed positive for avian influenza. The agency is monitoring all premises within the zone for any signs of disease."

The agency said last week that the virus was found in 12-week-old ducks on the commercial farm, and more testing will be done to confirm which strain is present, though it is connected to the H5N2 strain. The CFIA also said 14 000 ducks will be killed in an effort to stop the spread of the virus, which is highly contagious.

Even so, the CFIA says there's no reason to be afraid. "Avian influenza does not pose a risk to food safety when poultry and poultry products are properly handled and cooked," the agency said. "Avian influenza rarely affects humans that do not have consistent contact with infected birds." The CFIA says the avian control zone is part of an "internationally accepted practice" so trade can continue in areas of the country that aren't infected.

[The described event was officially reported to the OIE on 8 Jul 2016; the "immediate notification", including an interactive map, is available at http://tinyurl.com/h7atoj9.

The report included the following epidemiological comment:

"On 4 Jul 2016, 30 birds from a domestic duck farm were sampled as part of an export surveillance testing for avian influenza and were submitted to the National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease (NCFAD). The ducks were clinically healthy. Total RNA was extracted from 30 swab samples; 15 tested positive for influenza A matrix, and 13 for H5 using real time RT-PCR assays [real-time reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction]. The neuraminidase was typed as N2 using short N-typing conventional RT-PCR assay. The sequence of hemagglutinin cleavage site motif is consistent with LPAI viruses of H5 subtype. Top matches of the sequenced 426 bp RT-PCR product are North American wild bird origin LPAI viruses of H5 subtype". - Mod.AS
