While yellow leaf curl is making headlines, there is another
tomato-damaging disease of greater concern for the industry right now. It's
called spotted wilt, a virus spread by an insect called a thrips which
measures about an eighth- to a quarter-inch in length, said UC [University
of California] Davis plant pathologist Robert Gilbertson. "This virus, in
the last 2 years, has increased in its frequency in tomatoes, especially in
Fresno, Merced, and Kings counties," said Gilbertson.
The virus causes plants to wilt and turn a bronze color, with the plant's
veins turning black before tissue begins to die, Gilbertson said. Young
plants will die from the virus, while fruits on older plants develop rings.
Ross Siragusa, president and chief executive officer of the California
Tomato Growers Association, said spotted wilt has caused "considerable
economic damage" for some farmers, with one grower losing 500 acres (202.3
hectares) of tomatoes within the last few years. Because it's already done
damage, spotted wilt is a bigger concern than yellow leaf curl for state
tomato growers, Siragusa said.
Gilbertson said the California Tomato Research Institute is working with UC
Cooperative Extension to look at early detection and new tomato varieties
to control spotted wilt. The disease can be managed, Gilbertson said, with
a combination of early detection, a spray program and virus management.
Gilbertson added that California's system of disease management has worked
"very well," as researchers and farm advisors work closely together.

[_Tomato spotted wilt virus_ (TSWV; genus _Tospovirus_, family
_Bunyaviridae_) has one of the broadest host ranges among plant viruses and
has had a serious impact on many crop species worldwide causing up to 100
per cent yield loss in some instances. Diseases attributed to TSWV were 1st
reported in Australia about 1915. It is one of the few plant viruses with a
host range that includes dicots and monocots. Weed species can serve as
pathogen reservoirs.
TSWV is transmitted by various species of thrips, including the western
flower thrips (_Frankliniella occidentalis_), the onion thrips (_Thrips
tabaci_), and the chilli thrips (_Scirtothrips dorsalis_). The virus needs
to be acquired during the nymph stage by feeding on infected plants, which
will retain the ability to transmit it for the remainder of their lives.
The virus multiplies in the vector insects but cannot be passed on from
infected females through the eggs. TSWV is not seed transmitted but
transmission by mechanical means has been reported.
New tospoviruses are being found frequently. They represent the only genus
in the family of _Bunyaviridae_ that infect plants. Natural resistance
appears to be rare amongst their plant hosts, but they infect the insect
vectors without causing any symptoms. Scientists are discussing the
possibility that tospoviruses may have evolved from an insect virus that
acquired additional genetic information via recombination, either from a
plant or from another plant virus, enabling the new virus to infect plants.
For more information on tospoviruses see the recent ProMED-mail post
