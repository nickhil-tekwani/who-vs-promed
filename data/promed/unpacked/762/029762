------------------------------------------------------------------
I would like to reply to the moderator's comments regarding the
_Salmonella_ outbreak in the town of Alamosa, Colorado. Currently,
the only bacterium that has been isolated in this outbreak has been
_Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhimurium. However, the Colorado
Department of Public Health and Environment is still investigating
the possibility of other contaminants at this time.

We have also confirmed the source of the outbreak as Alamosa's
municipal water system. As per Monday's [24 Mar 2008] press release
on the City of Alamosa website, 5 of 6 water samples tested positive
for _Salmonella_ by PCR [polymerase chain reaction]. Please see the
link below.
