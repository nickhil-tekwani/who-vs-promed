There has been a confirmed outbreak of African swine fever [ASF] in pig farms in Nekede, Imo state, Nigeria.

Thousands of pigs have been lost due to this disease in the affected farms. The clinical signs include high body temperature above 41 C [105 F], reddish rashes, and a high mortality rate. Younger pigs are mostly affected.

The disease was confirmed by the Nigeria Veterinary Research Institute (NVRI) to be ASF. The disease is spreading fast to other pig farms in the state.

[ProMED thanks the EpiCore Global Surveillance Project member for the comment.

According to the official periodical reports of Nigeria to the OIE obtained since 2005, ASF has been present in all years excluding 2011. In 2015, 2016, and the 1st semester of 2017 (semi-annual report), the disease was reportedly present, but no quantitative data were presented.

Some additional information on ASF circulation in Nigeria can be found in Ref 1.
