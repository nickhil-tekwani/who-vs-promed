[The precise etiology of the infectious hemorrhagic fever is not
stated. It is presumed from the frequency of cases, low mortality,
and predominantly rural economy of the Inner Mongolian Autonomous
Region that the illness referred to in this report is the
rodent-transmitted disease known as hemorrhagic fever with renal
syndrome, and not the more serious Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever.
Further information would be appreciated. - Mod.CP]
