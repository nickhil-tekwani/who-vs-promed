Outbreak of _Cyclospora_ Infections in the Midwestern USA Linked to Bagged Salad Mix
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the FDA are investigating a multistate outbreak of _Cyclospora_ infections linked to bagged salad mix containing carrots, red cabbage, and iceberg lettuce purchased at ALDI, Hy-Vee, and Jewel-Osco stores in Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Minnesota, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wisconsin.

Advice to Consumers, Restaurants, Retailers, and Suppliers/Distributors
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
CDC has important advice for consumers and retailers in Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin:

Do not eat, sell, or serve:
- Recalled ALDI Little Salad Bar brand Garden Salad sold in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin
- Recalled Hy-Vee brand 12-ounce bagged Garden Salad sold in Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Minnesota, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wisconsin
- Recalled Jewel-Osco Signature Farms brand 12-ounce bagged Garden Salad sold in Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa

Check your home for any of these recalled salads. Throw any remaining salad away, even if some of it has been eaten and no one has gotten sick.

If you live in Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin and don't know whether the bagged garden salad blend you have in your home is one of these recalled salads, do not eat it. Throw it away.

Take action if you have symptoms of a _Cyclospora_ infection:
- Talk to your healthcare provider.
- Write down what you ate in the 2 weeks before you started to get sick.
- Report your illness to the health department.
- Assist public health investigators by answering questions about your illness.

Investigation Details
---------------------
On [20 Jun 2020], Hy-Vee and Jewel-Osco issued recalls for bagged salad products sold in several Midwestern states. Hy-Vee recalled Hy-Vee brand 12-ounce bagged Garden Salad produced by Fresh Express. This product was sold in Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Minnesota, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. Jewel-Osco, in cooperation with Fresh Express, recalled Signature Farms brand 12-ounce bagged Garden Salad sold in Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa. On [22 Jun 2020], ALDI recalled 12-ounce bagged Little Salad Bar Garden Salad sold in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin.

As of [22 Jun 2020], a total of 122 people with laboratory-confirmed _Cyclospora_ infections associated with this outbreak have been reported from 7 states: Illinois (30), Iowa (54), Kansas (1), Minnesota (13), Missouri (7) Nebraska (8), and Wisconsin (9).

Illnesses started on dates ranging from [11 May 2020] to [15 Jun 2020]. Ill people range in age from 16 to 92 years with a median age of 63 and 45% are female. Of 118 people with available information, 19 people (16%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Illnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 4 to 6 weeks. If the number of cases reported by CDC is different from the number reported by state or local health officials, data reported by local jurisdictions should be considered the most up to date. Any differences may be due to the timing of the reporting and website updates.

There are typically multiple clusters of _Cyclospora_ infections that occur each summer. CDC is working to determine if other recent cases of Cyclospora infection are linked to contaminated ingredients in these bagged salad mixes. This investigation is ongoing.

[Cyclosporiasis (https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/cyclosporiasis/) is an intestinal illness caused by the microscopic parasite _Cyclospora cayetanensis_. People can become infected with _Cyclospora_ by consuming food or water contaminated with the parasite. People living or traveling in countries where cyclosporiasis is endemic may be at increased risk of infection. Infected people shed unsporulated (non-infective; immature) _C. cayetanensis_ oocysts in their stool; immature oocysts usually require at least 1-2 weeks under favorable laboratory conditions to sporulate and become infective.

Symptoms of cyclosporiasis begin an average of 7 days (range, 2 days to 2 weeks or longer) after ingestion of sporulated oocysts (the infective form of the parasite).

Symptoms of cyclosporiasis may include the following:
- watery diarrhea (most common)
- loss of appetite
- weight loss
- cramping
- bloating
- increased gas
- nausea
- fatigue

Other symptoms that may occur but are less common include the following:
- vomiting
- low-grade fever

If a person ill from cyclosporiasis is not treated, symptoms can persist for several weeks to a month or more. Some symptoms, such as diarrhea, can return; and some symptoms, such as fatigue, may continue after the gastrointestinal symptoms have gone away. The infection usually is not life-threatening. Some infected persons do not have any symptoms, particularly persons from areas where cyclosporiasis is endemic, such as tropical and subtropical regions. - Mod.LL
