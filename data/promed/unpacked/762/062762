The continuing viral influenza epidemic in Jumla and nearby districts has
claimed dozens more lives, taking the total death toll thus far reported to
194, according to various despatches by [Post reporters in the field. By
far the biggest toll reported is in Jumla district where six more deaths
were reported. The toll in Jumla now stands at 121 confirmed deaths due to
viral influenza.
Reports of substantial numbers of deaths have also been pouring in from
Kalikot disitrict. The jump in death toll in recent days is due to
still-arriving reports from remote districts. Communication in these parts
of the country is difficult, often taking days of treks from a village to
reach the district headquarters.
Meanwhile, a team of doctors who reached Jumla [on 10 Mar 1999 is
continuing their frantic efforts to stem the influenza tide. Though medical
supplies have already reached Jumla, the quantity is insufficient and is not
expected to last more than a week, doctors say.
Health officials have already sent to Kathmandu blood samples and throat
swabs of victims to identify the strain of the killer influenza virus.
