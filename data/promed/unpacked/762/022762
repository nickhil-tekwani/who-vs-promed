STREPTOCOCCUS SUIS, HUMAN INFECTION - UK (YORKSHIRE):
REQUEST FOR INFO
********************************

Date: Fri 1 Oct 1999 22:18:23 +0100
From: Martin Schweiger <germbuster@schwefam.demon.co.uk>

A 30 year old male farm labourer, who had his spleen removed 3 years ago,
died from septicaemia on Fri 27 Aug 1999. _Streptococcus suis_ type 14 was
isolated from a blood culture. The same organism had been identified in the
pigs.
I am employed by Leeds Health Authority. It is my responsibility to
investigate and take
steps to prevent any more cases. I am the source of the information, but
collaborating with a number of other agencies to document what has happened.
I would be very interested to know of any other septicaemias (fatal or
otherwise) associated with _Streptococcus suis_ type 14. I would hope that
through ProMED I can get a feel of how rare this type of event is.
