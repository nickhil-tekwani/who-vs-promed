Turkey confirms return of bird flu in chickens
-----------------------------------------------
Turkey's agriculture ministry confirmed on Thu 8 Feb 2007 an outbreak
of bird flu in the southeast of the country, just over a year after
the H5N1 strain of the disease killed 4 children in the region. The
ministry said in a statement bird flu had been found on Thursday in
the village of Bogazkoy in the Batman province. The ministry said it
believed wild birds had spread the disease. "We have put under
quarantine an area of 3 square km," Batman Governor Haluk Imga told
Reuters. "We will cull nearly 1500 chickens, ducks and turkeys in
that area. A 25-man team is carrying out this work." Private
broadcaster CNN Turk quoted Imga as saying there was no evidence of
the disease spreading to the human population.
Veterinary experts were making tests to determine whether the virus
was the deadly H5N1 strain.
Last year [2006], the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed 4
deaths in Turkey from H5N1, all of them children from the town of
Dogubayazit near the Iranian border in Turkey's impoverished east.
Eight other Turks tested positive for the H5N1 strain but recovered,
according to WHO data. More than 160 people worldwide have died of
the virus since 2003.
Experts believe migratory birds originally brought the virus to
Turkey and Europe from Asia and Russia, infecting domestic poultry.
Turkish authorities culled more than 1.3 million birds during the
2006 outbreaks. Bird flu is cited as one of the factors behind a 7
percent drop in Turkish tourism revenues in 2006 from the previous year.

The bird flu outbreak at a farm in Suffolk may be linked to imports
from the firm's plant in Hungary, the government has said. The
pathogenic H5N1 strain was found on a Hungarian geese farm in January
2007. Deputy Chief Vet Fred Landeg said a possible route of infection
was from imported "poultry products."
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said
preliminary scientific tests showed the 2 viruses "may well be
identical. Defra, the Food Standards Agency and the Health Protection
Agency are investigating the possibility of a link between the
Hungarian outbreaks, poultry meat from Hungary and the introduction
of disease in the farm in Suffolk," it added.
The company also has a division in Sarvar, Hungary. Defra said [the
farm company] was temporarily suspending the movement of poultry
products between the 2 outlets until the investigation is complete.
In a statement, [the farm company] said it continues to work closely
with Defra in its investigation. "We are cooperating fully, and, as a
precautionary measure, we have volunteered to cease any movements to
and from Hungary," it said. "We want to reassure consumers that [our]
products are perfectly safe to eat."

Contaminated food "caused UK bird flu outbreak"
-----------------------------------------------
A consignment of dead turkeys from the [Suffolk's farm's company]
plant in Hungary, where there have been recent outbreaks of bird flu,
could be the source of the disease's outbreak in Britain last week,
The Observer can reveal. The firm's Suffolk plant now lies at the
centre of a major investigation by government officials who no longer
believe that Britain's 1st outbreak of bird flu was spread by wild
birds. The government, which has known about the contaminated meat
since Monday [5 Feb 2007], put out a statement tonight [8 Feb 2007]
in response to The Observer story. The Observer can reveal that a
consignment of turkeys, which had been partly processed, traveled by
lorry from the Hungarian plant and arrived in the UK a few days
before 27 Jan 2007, the date when farm workers began to notice the
1st signs of illness in the turkey chicks at the farm near Holton, Suffolk.
A Whitehall source said there were concerns about the bio-security at
the processing plant, which lies adjacent to the Holton farm, where
the infected birds were found. Officials from the Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) are looking at
allegations that scraps of meat are sometimes left lying around the
floor of the plant and are scavenged by rats and wild birds, creating
a possible route for infection.
Defra was aware last Monday [5 Feb 2007] that a consignment of meat
had been taken into the plant, but it was not revealed to the public.
The environment secretary, David Miliband, made no mention of it when
he made a statement to the House of Commons that day. Nor was it
revealed by Lord Rooker, the agriculture minister, in the Lords
earlier today [8 Feb 2007]. Lord Rooker confirmed that there had been
no importation of chicks or eggs into Britain, but did not mention
the possibility that carcasses had been transported into the plant.
British health officials also told the European Union last Tuesday
they did not believe there was a link between the outbreak of bird
flu at the farm and 2 recent cases in Hungary, where [the farm's
company] also has poultry interests.
A Defra spokesman said last night [7 Feb 2007]: "The government is
developing its investigation into what might have caused the outbreak
of avian influenza in the Suffolk poultry farm, following preliminary
scientific tests showing the viruses in Suffolk and recent outbreaks
in Hungary may well be identical. Along with a number of other
hypotheses, Defra, the Food Standards Agency and the Health
Protection Agency are investigating the possibility of a link between
the Hungarian outbreaks, poultry meat from Hungary and the
introduction of disease in the farm in Suffolk. The investigation
will include arrangements at the company's adjacent plant for food
processing. Scientific advice remains that the risk to human health
is negligible, and Food Standards Agency advice remains the same,
that properly cooked poultry is safe to eat."
Deputy Chief Vet, Fred Landeg said: "Our investigations have shown
that one possible route of infection is poultry product imported from
Hungary. It is important that this is investigated thoroughly, along
with all the other possible routes. We are working in partnership
with the Food Standards Agency and the Health Protection Agency to
carry out a thorough investigation. We are also working in close
contact with the Hungarian authorities and the European Commission.
The company involved have voluntarily agreed to temporarily suspend
the movement of poultry products between their outlets in the UK and
Hungary until the investigation is complete."
The British and Hungarian outbreaks, the 1st in Europe for more than
6 months, occurred within days of one another. Officials in Brussels
said no wild birds had been discovered bearing the virus, despite
widespread monitoring.
The Observer understands that the information about the meat
consignment was considered by Defra officials to be "commercially
confidential," and a decision was initially taken not to put it into
the public domain.
The government confirmed earlier this week that the strain of the
H5N1 virus, which was identified in one turkey shed the previous
Friday [2 Feb 2007], was the same strain found last month [January
2007] in Hungary, where an outbreak among geese on a farm prompted
the slaughter of thousands of birds. A flock of 3000 geese on the
infected farm near Szentes in southern Hungary was destroyed last
month after they were found to have H5N1. The virus 1st appeared in
the country in February last year [2006] in wild geese, swans and
domestic poultry.
Defra has continued to investigate the movement of people and animals
on and off the farm, including any links the farm may have had with
Hungary, where there have been a series of outbreaks in the last
month and where [the farm company] owns Saga Foods, the country's
largest poultry company. His plant in Sarvar lies 165 miles from the
recent outbreak in the south of the country, in Sventes.
Last Monday [5 Feb 2007], Miliband ruled out claims that the outbreak
of bird flu could have been caused by chicks imported from Hungary.
"In respect of the chicks, they all came from within this country, so
there is no Hungarian connection. The fact is the factory involved in
the Hungarian outbreak is not a factory [belonging to the farm
company involved in the Suffolk outbreak]."

From: Joe Dudley <jdudley@eaicorp.com>

The fact that animal industry workers in Hungary, Romania and several
other Eastern European countries with endemic livestock disease
issues (notably CSF and now probably bird flu) are now free to move
around as migrant workers in the EC livestock and poultry industries
is a new dynamic that the EU as well as the UK needs to confront.
Based on what I remember from a presentation at the Avian Flu
symposium in Cambridge last April [2006], a model developed from H7N7
outbreaks in the Netherlands would predict that the date of the
actual initial index infection case in this outbreak should have been
about 10-14 days prior to the onset of this observable non-background
mortality (if it started from a single case).
Noticeable and exponential mortality increases in this model
developed at between 2 weeks to 3 weeks after initial disease
infection, as I recall. 1st infection takes 2 days to present, this
case infects 2 [cases] 2 days later, these 2 each infect 2 more etc.
Truly unmistakable catastrophic mortality kicks in at just about 2
weeks after infection of the index case in the flock.
The paper should be published in the symposium proceedings in an
upcoming Avian Diseases issue.

[If the Guardian/Observer is correct about the arrival of the partly
processed Hungarian turkeys on 27 Jan 2007 at the nearby processing
plant, this would possibly rule out that shipment as the probable
cause, as Movement Restrictions were imposed on 1 Feb 2007. But if
there was one shipment from Hungary, there could well have been
earlier ones in January 2007. To get from the processing plant to a
turkey house is another obstacle, but one should never rule out dirty boots.
Other questions arise: Has Defra implemented appropriate
surveillance, especially given that the government vets were unable
to identify this disease on clinical inspection? Was the
"contaminated food" distributed to any other sites? What route did
the lorry (or lorries?) take, and have other locations and countries
been alerted? Is withholding this information (or failing to alert a
suspicion on an un-named premises) because Defra considered it
"commercially confidential" consistent with their duty of care to
livestock, livestock keepers and the general public? - Mod.MHJ]

Transfer of turkeys from Hungary examined in British bird flu outbreak inquiry
-------------------------------------------
Scientists are investigating whether a bird flu outbreak at a British
poultry farm was caused by a consignment of dead turkeys imported
from Hungary, government officials said Thursday [8 Feb 2007]. The
Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it is
examining the transfer of partly processed birds from a Hungarian
plant to a farm in Holton, about 130 miles (210 km) northeast of
London, owned by [a company that is] Europe's biggest turkey producer.
A department spokeswoman said the 2 plants were linked but could not
confirm whether the Hungarian facility was owned by [the same farm
company involved in the Suffolk outbreak]. "Around 38 tons of partly
processed turkeys are transported from a linked Hungarian plant to
the Suffolk farm each week," said the spokeswoman, on customary
condition of anonymity in line with policy. "Investigations have
ruled out the transfer of the HN51 virus by workers traveling between
Hungary and Britain." The spokeswoman said the company had agreed to
temporarily suspend imports from Hungary.
She said that signs of H5N1 had been found in birds housed in 3 other
turkey sheds at the Holton farm, following the initial discovery of
the virus. "Results so far have confirmed the presence of the virus
in 4 out of 22 turkey sheds," the spokeswoman said.

[Considering the amount of foot-traffic on any poultry farm, this
finding that other houses contained infected birds is to be expected.
This reaffirms the wisdom of total culling when faced with this
virus. - Mod.MHJ]

[These 2 OIE reports contain a couple of interesting pieces of
information. In the Pakistan outbreak, there are an unusually wide
variety of bird species involved, including parakeets, and it would
be beneficial to have more information on the relative distribution
of species, attack rate by species etc. on the outbreak farm at Lohar
Banda. Of course, some of these birds might have higher commercial
value than typical backyard poultry and may therefore be associated
with more movement off the farm before the outbreak but, hopefully,
not after the outbreak was in full swing.
The statistics given on the UK outbreak are a little disquieting
because they mean that all the birds in the affected house were
culled but that 95 percent of the birds on the farm complex remained.
However, this must be a reporting artifact, as today's report
indicates all 159 000 birds have now been culled. See Avian influenza
