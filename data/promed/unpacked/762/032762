In Oregon rabies is also found mostly in bats. Silver-Hair and Big brown
bats seem to be the natural carriers of rabies rather than the Mexican Free
tailed (not a species found in the Northwest as far as I know).
I have consulted with University experts about bats in Oregon and Northwest
US. There are approximately 16 species in this area, less than half migrate
south for the winter and the rest hibernate. Of those bats that migrate,
most do not migrate very far and certainly not all the way down to Mexico.
In Oregon 9-11% of the bats tested (human and animal exposures) are
positive for rabies. This may translate into 1% of the bat population being
positive for rabies, but it is only an estimate.
