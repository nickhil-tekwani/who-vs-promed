BTV-8 -- South Africa
---------------------
In the ongoing debate on the origin of the European BTV 8, we would like to
make the following comments.
From our molecular studies on the S2 sequences of the BTV vaccine and
reference strains (manuscript in preparation) we can confirm what was said
earlier by Professor Mertens about the relatedness of the BTV 8 vaccine and
reference strains. They have almost identical S2 nucleotide sequence and
the dsRNA and amplified genome PAGE profiles are also almost identical.
In a recent study we partially sequenced VP2 segments of 130 South African
BTV isolates (multiple serotypes) from 1986 to 2003. Several of these are
BTV 8 isolates. Therefore we have some sequence information on "western"
BTV 8 isolates.
Following the news of the European outbreak we have prepared our BTV 8
virus isolates as well as some bovine isolates from 1996. Some cattle
isolates are BTV serotype 8. We will be amplifying the complete genomes of
these isolates shortly and sequencing selected segments for comparison to
the European strains.
If we can initiate cooperation or if the BTV strain from Europe is made
available to our BTV OIE Reference Centre, we can compare it with the South
African isolates.
