Possible Methanol Poisoning in Kenya
------------------------------------
Residents of 3 city slums woke up yesterday morning to dead bodies lying
all over the place. People had collapsed on the paths or corridors to
their houses. Some died as they answered calls of nature, and others died
in their seats or beds.
They had all consumed an unknown and illicit drink, an intoxicant, in many
of the watering holes [pubs] dotting the Mukuru wa Kayaba, Mukuru Kwa
Njenga and Sinai slums in Industrial Area and on the Nairobi River.
A cup of the demon drink was said to cost Sh 10 [approximately 15 cents
US], which is why it has been dubbed "10 by 10" or "10 10." Some survivors
had lost their eyesight;
others were hysterical and many were disoriented.
The survivors did not know what had happened and incoherently talked of the
drink before either collapsing or being rushed to nearby clinics or the
Kenyatta National Hospital.
By 1:00 PM, the hospital had physically established 16 people died in
Mukuru Kwa Njenga, 14 people in Mukuru Kayaba, one in Mukuru Kware, 3 in
Sinai slums, and the toll was rising.
A team of senior Government officials, police, and medical experts led by
the Nairobi provincial Commissioner, Mr. Cyrus Maina, visited the area.
Maina said a provincial team to mobilize and educate slum dwellers about
the dangers of the possibly lethal chemical in the brew was an absolute
necessity.
Preliminary investigations established those who were discovered dead
yesterday morning are said to have consumed the illicit liquor on Tuesday
afternoon. Most of the victims suffered blindness moments before they died,
with their hands folded into fists and their eyes sunken. [This is probably
evidence of photophobia, or sensitivity to light. - Mod.TG]
The brew is said to be diluted with water to fill a 30-liter jerrican and
served to clients.
Police vehicles and other volunteers ferried bodies to the City Mortuary
while the survivors were rushed to Kenyatta National Hospital for the
better part of the day.

Kenya: Death Toll from Illegal Brew Rises to 51
-----------------------------------------------
The number of people dead after drinking illegal spirits in the Kenyan
capital Nairobi rose to 51 on Thursday, with many more losing their sight,
police said.
Police spokesman Peter Kimanthi said the latest tally showed 51 people had
died and another 174 people were in hospital after consuming the illicit
brew, known locally as chang'aa, on Tuesday.
Twelve women have been arrested for selling the spirit, although Kimanthi
said
police had not yet located its source. "We think it was brewed at some
place other than Nairobi," he said. "We are looking for that brewing place,
wherever it is."
Kenyatta National Hospital was crammed with the victims of the brew on
Thursday, many of them blind, some writhing in pain. Over 20 people died in
the hospital on Wednesday, medical officials said, while more victims
continued to arrive on Thursday morning from slum areas all over the capital.
Nairobi's slums are packed with shebeens (illegal drinking parlors) mainly
run by elderly widows who compete for customers with the intensity of their
brew. Problems arise when pure alcohol or other chemicals are added to the
concoctions to give them an extra kick.
"We think it (the fatal brew) contained methanol, which is outlawed in this
country - it is a poison," said Dr. Richard Muga, director of medical
services in Kenya's health ministry. "If you take it, the first thing that
happens is it compromises your respiratory system...you go blind, and then
you die in 6 to 8 hours."
There have been several other instances of mass deaths from consumption of
laced chang'aa in recent years, and newspapers urged the government to
clamp down on the industry, or at least legalize and monitor it.
"It is significant [that though] these brews are drunk in the open, most
provincial administrators and police officers have been turning a blind eye
to the menace," the Daily Nation News said in an editorial. "The only
solution to this menace is to allow the brewing and consumption of
traditional liquors...and to insist the drinks be brewed in controlled
environments so the quality can be constantly monitored," it said.
Traditional spirits are very popular in Kenya because they are powerful and
cheap, although they were officially banned in the 1970s.

Death toll from fatal Kenyan brew rises to nearly 100
-----------------------------------------------------
Nearly 100 people have died in Kenya after drinking a fatally contaminated
illegal
brew, and another 400 people are hospitalized, some suffering from
blindness, Kenyan police said on Friday.

[Methanol (wood alcohol) is produced from the destructive distillation of
wood. Epidemics of methanol toxicity have resulted from the consumption of
methanol-contaminated whiskey. The formation of 2 toxic metabolites,
formaldehyde and formic acid, causes methanol poisoning. The elimination
rate depends upon the the folate pool. In primates it is generally small
and consequently primates (including humans) are more sensitive to methanol
toxicity than other animals.
Methanol is widely available in formulations including antifreeze,
windshield washer fluid, Sterno canned heat, shellacs, various paints,
paint removers, varnishes, duplicating fluids, and gasoline additives.
Fatalities have been reported after ingestion of 15 ml or 3 teaspoons of a
40 percent solution, although 30 ml is generally considered a minimal
lethal dose. With aggressive medical care it is possible to survive the
ingestion of 500-600 ml. However, consumption of as little as 10 ml may
cause blindness, with the amount varying with the individual.
Methanol is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and peak levels
occur generally within 30-90 minutes. It is distributed into tissues, so
concentrations in the vitreous humor and optic nerve are high. The highest
concentrations are found in the kidney, liver and gastrointestinal tract,
with smaller concentrations in the brain, muscle and adipose tissues.
Methanol is oxidized 10 times more slowly than ethanol. Consequently there
is a longer elimination half-life.
Onset of symptoms varies between 40 minutes and 72 hours
post-ingestion. Co-ingestion with alcohol will delay the appearance of
symptoms, but the absence of symptoms does not exclude serious toxicity.
The usual latent period is 12-24 hours.
Clinical signs may include headache, vertigo, lethargy and confusion, which
are common in mild to moderate ethanol intoxications. Coma and convulsions
appear in severe cases, probably as a result of cerebral edema. Methanol
produces little to no euphoria, unlike ethanol.
Blurred vision, decreased visual acuity, and photophobia (sensitivity to
light) are common complaints. Constricted visual fields, fixed and dilated
pupils, retinal edema and hyperemia of the optic disk are common clinical
findings. Prompt initial therapy is necessary to reverse symptoms, though
visual defects have persisted in up to 25 percent of severe cases.
Methanol is a mucosal irritant and may produce nausea, vomiting and
abdominal pain, not unlike large doses of ethanol.
Early in the clinical course, gut decontamination with ipecac or lavage may
be indicated. However, if the methanol is mixed with ethanol, these
patients may not realize something is out of the ordinary until it is too
late for this type of treatment to be helpful.
Intravenous administration of ethanol in a 10 percent dextrose solution may
be helpful. As ethanol prolongs the elimination half-life of methanol, the
treatment may take several days and the patient should be hospitalized.
Dialysis may be necessary to prevent kidney failure as well. - Mod.TG]
