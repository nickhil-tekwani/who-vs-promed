West Nile virus, horses - France, September 2004
-------------------------------------------
On 16 Sep 2004, the French Food Safety Agency (which, in collaboration with
the Ministry of Agriculture, is responsible for equine West Nile virus
surveillance in France) reported 2 cases of West Nile virus-associated
encephalitis among horses living in the Camargue (a Mediterranean region of
France). 10 other suspected equine encephalitis cases are currently under
investigation, thus suggesting [West Nile] virus activity in this area. As
stated by the French authorities, no autochthonous human cases have
presently been detected in France, by the national West Nile virus
surveillance system, in 2004.
According to the national West Nile virus surveillance plan, additional
public health measures have been announced, involving blood-transfusion
safety measures, equine surveillance reinforcement, and mosquito species
surveillance and testing for West Nile virus.
After the human and equine outbreak in Camargue in 1962 - 1965, neither
human nor equine cases were detected until 2000. In 2000, 76 equine cases
were identified in Camargue. In 2003, 7 human cases and 4 equine cases were
detected in the Var (another Mediterranean region of France).
