Over 150 people in South Sudan have died from kala-azar [visceral leishmaniasis], a disease transmitted through sand fly bites, the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in a report.

Kala-azar is endemic in remote areas of northern Jonglei and southern Upper Nile states, where communities are exposed to insect bites as they often sleep without mosquito nets, the report noted.

"The kala-azar rate continued to rise, with 315 cases and 10 deaths during the last week, and a cumulative 4939 cases and 152 deaths since January [2015]," it added.

Out of 1614 cases registered in the same period in 2013, only 45 people reportedly died implying this year's [2015] outbreak, mainly exacerbated by the ongoing conflict, shows a significant surge in kala-azar cases.

Meanwhile, the medical charity, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said it continued to provide medical assistance to clinics treating kala-azar patients in Lankien [Jonglei], where most of the deaths occurred.

Last week [week of 19 Oct 2015], 300 people affected by kala-azar were reportedly admitted in its clinic in Lankien while 800 others receive treatment daily. "The up-tick in kala-azar cases is likely related to conflict related displacement, as non-immune populations move into endemic areas," said OCHA.

[ProMED-mail has reported repeatedly on visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in South Sudan, which is probably the most endemic area for this infection in the world. For background comments on VL, please refer to ProMED-mail posting "Leishmaniasis, visceral - South Sudan (02) 20141006.2836861" from 6 Oct 2014.

The incidence apparently continues to increase underlying that control measures, especially vector control, are not working in a situation of civil unrest. The long incubation time and treatment with side effects leading to defaults before cure, contribute to a probably increasing human reservoir. The contributions of HIV and malnutrition are unknown. - Mod.EP]
