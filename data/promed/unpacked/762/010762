[Since Fri 6 Aug 2010] 3 elderly people have died of encephalitis and
several others [have been admitted to] hospital, with doctors suspecting
that they may have been infected by the West Nile virus. A 79 year old
patient, who also suffered from heart and diabetes problems, died on Sunday
[8 Aug 2010] of encephalitis and 2 elderly women died on Friday [6 Aug 2010].

Doctors in this northern Greek city [Thessaloniki] say that, of the 22
patients treated since Friday [6 Aug 2010], 7 remain in hospital with 2
"strongly suspected" to have the West Nile virus, which is commonly spread
by mosquitoes. Results of lab tests are expected on Monday [9 Aug 2010].

Many people with the West Nile virus [infection] never get sick, but a few
develop meningitis or encephalitis and can die from the disease.

[It will be of considerable interest to know if the laboratory results
confirm West Nile virus infection in these cases. It is not clear if these
include the encephalitis cases in Greek Central Macedonia reported on 6 Aug
2010 by Dr Dimitrios Zonios (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20100806.2672).
Thessaloniki is part of that larger geographic area. As pointed out by
Mod.TY in that post, West Nile virus (WNV) transmission has been occurring
within the past 4 months in the Mediterranean Basin -- west of Greece in
Italy and south east of Greece in Israel. So it is not surprising that
transmission has been found in Greece as well. It would be of interest also
to know if laboratory tests for Toscana virus infection are being included
for these cases. Toscana virus is being recognized increasingly as an
etiological agent for encephalitis in Europe, although not reported as
occurring as far east as Greece. Toscana virus is an arthropod-borne virus
which is transmitted to humans by _Phlebotomus_ spp sandflies (see
ProMED-mail archive no. 20100802.2587).
