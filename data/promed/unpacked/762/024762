The H5N1 strain of avian influenza virus, clade 2.3.2.1C, which has been prevalent in Viet Nam's northern regions, was discovered for the 1st time in a number of dead ducks in southern Dong Nai province, about 1120 km [about 696 miles] from capital Hanoi, local media reported Friday [7 Mar 2014].

State-run Viet Nam News Agency quoted an official from Dong Nai province's Animal Health Department as reporting that results were confirmed after a sample from the birds tested positive for the virus.

Previously, the A/H5N1 strain, clade 1.1, was found in affected poultry sold at many markets across Viet Nam, with the availability rate up to 6 percent in 2013.

From late 2013 and particularly in the 1st 2 months of 2014, the A/H5N1 strain, clade 2.3.2.1.C, has penetrated into southern regions, along with clade 1.1. To date [7 Mar 2014], 8 out of 13 cities and provinces in southern Mekong delta were reported to be struck with avian flu outbreaks.

Dong Nai province is home to the largest number of poultry raised nationwide, with over 12 million. It is also located at the gateway of Ho Chi Minh City, the key economic hub in the south. As such, the transportation of poultry products is more likely to trigger the outbreak of bird flu, according to the local animal health department.

Currently, only 10 percent of the poultry in Dong Nai has been vaccinated against the A/H5N1 strain of the virus. Earlier, the province detected 2 bird flu cases in Trang Bom and Cam My districts.

The latest statistics from the National Steering Committee on Bird Flu Prevention and Control revealed that the H5N1 virus hit 23 provinces and cities across Viet Nam, with over 80 000 infected poultry culled. A total of 2 Vietnamese died from the virus so far this year [2014], one in southern Binh Phuoc and the other in Dong Thap provinces.

[Since the start of the reoccurring HPAI H5N1 epizootic in Viet Nam (early October 2013), a total of 37 new outbreaks, affecting chicken and duck farms, have been reported to the OIE. Their updated summary, including an interactive map showing the virus spread throughout the entire country, is available at http://tinyurl.com/pngnrqw. The most recent 2 follow-up reports have been submitted on 10 Mar 2014 (follow-up report No 12, addressing one outbreak in Dong Nai province), and on 11 Mar 2014 (follow-up report No 13, addressing 2 outbreaks in Quang Nam and Ha Giang provinces). Unfortunately, the species of the affected "birds" is not given. The submission of 2 follow-up reports in 2 consecutive days might reflect an upsurge of the disease incidence beyond the anticipated seasonal rise.

A strain of H5N1 HPAI virus (clade 1 virus) probably entered Viet Nam sometime in 2003. It was widespread by early 2004, when reported to the OIE affecting poultry throughout the country. While clade 1.1 viruses persisted in southern regions since, during the recent 2-3 years, 3 genetically distinct subgroups of clade 2.3.2.1 have been found in northern and central Viet Nam, with clade 2.3.2.1C recently spreading southwards. This virus strain demonstrates higher pathogenic risk.

Since June 2012, a decline in protection against the 2.3.2.1C viruses by H5N1 poultry vaccines used in Viet Nam was observed (Ref 1). For additional information on Viet Nam's H5N1 vaccination problem, also addressing clades 2.3.2.1A and 2.3.2.1B, see references.
