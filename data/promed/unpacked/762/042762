From: Claudio Maierovitch Pessanha Henriques <claudiomph@uol.com.br>

I have been in Roraima two weeks ago and got the information that
although two of the cases became sick in Boa Vista, both had come from
forest areas recently, where they must have been infected. There is a
big concern because transmission concentrates in an area near the
frontier with Guyana and there is not a reaction of health authorities
of this latter country by providing imediate immunization in critical
areas of risk.
