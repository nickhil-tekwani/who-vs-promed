E. coli suspected now in 27 NC cases
-----------------------------------
A command center has been opened to coordinate the investigation into an
_E. coli_ O157 outbreak, as the number of suspected cases in North Carolina
rose to 27. Of that number, health officials say 18 cases are confirmed.
Officials say the strongest lead they have as to the source of the outbreak
is a petting zoo at the NC State Fair. 14 of the cases have links to the
state fair, and one is linked to the Cleveland County fair. But, health
officials say they're still not entirely sure of the source.

[As has been emphasized in the past, aggressive hand washing is always
required after children have visited a petting zoo. This moderator was a
visitor to the North Carolina state fair this year [2004], along with his
18-month-old granddaughter, and can assure ProMED-mail readers that there
was ample signage at the petting zoo emphasizing the need for hand washing,
and, easily available materials to accomplish this important goal. My
granddaughter has remained well despite a fair amount of time in the
petting zoo. - Mod.LL]
