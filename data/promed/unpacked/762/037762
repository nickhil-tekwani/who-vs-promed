The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said today (5 Jan 2016) that a dead great egret found in Diamond Hill, Wong Tai Sin, was confirmed to be H5N6 positive after laboratory testing.

The dead bird was found and collected from a non-public area near Spring Hill in the Nan Lian Garden, Diamond Hill, Wong Tai Sin, last Thursday (31 Dec 2016). The great egret is a common resident of Hong Kong and some are winter visitors.

The spokesman said cleaning and disinfection have been stepped up at the venue, adding that there are no poultry farms within 3 km of where the dead bird was found.

In view of the case, the AFCD has phoned poultry farmers to remind them to strengthen precautionary and biosecurity measures against avian influenza. Letters have been issued to farmers, pet bird shop owners and licence holders of pet poultry and racing pigeons reminding them that proper precautions must be taken.

The spokesman said the department would conduct frequent inspections of poultry farms and the wholesale market to ensure that proper precautions against avian influenza have been implemented. The department will continue its wild bird monitoring and surveillance.

"People should avoid contact with wild birds and live poultry and their droppings. They should clean their hands thoroughly after coming into contact with them. The public can call 1823 for follow-up if they come across suspicious, sick or dead birds, including the carcasses of wild birds and poultry," the spokesman said.

The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) will continue to be vigilant over imported live poultry as well as live poultry stalls. It will also remind stall operators to maintain good hygiene.

The Department of Health will keep up with its health education to remind the public to maintain strict personal and environmental hygiene to prevent avian influenza.

The AFCD, the FEHD, the Customs and Excise Department and the Police will strive to deter the illegal import of poultry and birds into Hong Kong to minimise the risk of avian influenza outbreaks caused by imported poultry and birds that have not gone through inspection and quarantine.

All relevant government departments will continue to be highly vigilant and strictly enforce preventive measures against avian influenza. Health advice is available from the "H5N1 Health Advice" page on the AFCD website at www.afcd.gov.hk .

[Highly pathogenic avian influenza subtype H5N6 has been reported since 2014 in poultry in mainland China, Laos and Viet Nam.

The 1st human infection with (A)H5N6 avian influenza virus was reported from central China (Sichuan province) on 4 May 2014; the patient died. Local media had reported his sickness on 23 Apr 2014. The regional Ministry of Agriculture published on 4 May 2014 a report indicating that the poultry holding of the patient had been under veterinary investigation since 23 Apr 2014 and that on 3 May 2014, the reference laboratory isolated avian influenza virus subtype H5N6 from the samples. This information was officially notified to the OIE on 5 May 2014, designating the causative agent as (LPAI) H5N6 of low pathogenicity for poultry; this complied also with the recorded clinical picture (apparent morbidity rate 0.07 percent). However, following further investigations by the OIE reference laboratory for avian influenza in Harbin, the strain was confirmed as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N6. The previous immediate notification to the OIE was, therefore, accordingly amended.

On 7 May 2014, the veterinary services of Laos notified the OIE about an outbreak of HPAI H5N6 which had taken place almost 2 months earlier, starting on 13 Mar 2014. No data on the clinical observations were provided, but the notification included the following epidemiological information:
"1. Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: introduction of new live animals
2. Epidemiological comments: samples from this outbreak have now been tested at the Australian Animal Health Laboratory. Sequencing analysis of original samples (post-mortem tissues) from both chickens and ducks shows that these are H5N6 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, with the highly pathogenic HA cleavage site sequence motif, PLRERRRKR*GLF. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene sequence indicates that the HA is derived from the Asian H5N1 clade 2.3.4 HA lineage; however, they clustered with 'variant' (reassortant) clade 2.3.4 H5 HPAI viruses from China of various NA subtypes. Follow-up sequencing of virus isolates from these samples confirms these findings. Full genome sequencing has been completed."

In July 2014, Viet Nam reported to the OIE that avian influenza isolates from 2 earlier outbreaks, in April and June 2014, had caused an apparent morbidity rate of 50 percent. The notification included the following epidemiological comments: "This is a new strain detected from outbreak surveillance activities. The initial result was positive for H5 but negative for N1. Therefore, further testing was needed, and the final result was only available in July 2014 (N6 positive). All poultry in affected flocks were destroyed immediately when poultry showing clinical signs of HPAI were detected. Samples were taken from surrounding poultry flocks. All were negative for avian influenza."

The described events in the 3 countries underline the great importance of early submission of samples from suspected AI cases to local and reference laboratories.

The surveillance and reporting policy as well as the transparency of the public and animal health agencies of Hong Kong are exemplary.

ProMED-mail included the following comment in post 20140925.2805654: "It remains to be established how a new AI strain has been found to be circulating in the 3 neighbouring countries almost simultaneously. Most likely, the virus spread (wherefrom?) by live poultry along the intensive trade routes known to prevail in the region. However, other potential routes, such as wild birds, deserve to be attended to as well by the investigators". The Hong Kong findings may be supportive of suspected role of wild birds in HPAI H5N6 epidemiology, - Mod.AS
