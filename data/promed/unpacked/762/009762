Susceptibility of African Elephant to Foot and Mouth Dis.: RFI
--------------------------------------------
A recent ProMED-mail posting included information from a Reuters report
(V2000 #270) about the likelihood of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD)
infections in wildlife in the current FMD outbreak in South Africa. In the
last sentence it states the elephants would not be affected. It is clear
the Asian elephant is quite susceptible to FMD and the disease can cause
very severe lameness. I wonder could someone clarify the matter of
susceptibility of the African elephant for the sake of accuracy in the
ProMED-mail record?

Foot and Mouth Disease in African Elephants
---------------------------------------------
With regards to FMD in the African elephant, it would appear this species
is highly resistant to the SAT group of FMD viruses. I base this statement
on the following observations and research findings:
1) In the Kruger National Park, all the buffalo herds are endemically
infected with all 3 SAT strains of FMD. While regular short-term clinical
epizootics of the disease occur in sympatric cloven-hoofed game in the park
(impala, greater kudu, bushbuck, nyala, warthog and giraffe), FMD has
never been diagnosed in the elephant. Between 1968 and 1994,
thousands of elephant carcasses were inspected for the presence of FMD
lesions during culling operations - with negative results. Furthermore,
FMD has never been diagnosed or reported in free-ranging elephant anywhere
in Africa, and in most conservation areas, they share range with
endemically-infected buffalo.
2) Random serological testing of thousands of elephant in several African
countries failed to detect any antibodies to FMD.
3) Experimental needle infection of elephant calves with FMD virus resulted
in severe oral and foot lesions, but the disease failed to transmit to
in-contact controls. The clinical signs in these elephants and those
recorded in Asian elephants are severe and would not easily go unnoticed.
4) Elephant calves housed with acutely-infected cattle failed to become
infected and did not even sero-convert. The only report in the literature
of African elephant ever becoming infected with FMD came from Italy (1970),
where clinical disease occurred in a group of 15 circus elephants and Type
A virus was isolated. There is some doubt as to whether this was in fact
an African elephant, because 30 years ago, most circus elephants were of
the Asian species. However, it may be that African elephant are
susceptible to the exotic European and/or Asian types of FMD viruses.
The current outbreak in Kwazulu/Natal in South Africa is caused by type O
virus, which is alien to South Africa, and should therefore be considered a
"wild card." However, Type O has become endemic in buffalo populations in
some East African countries, and no infection of elephants has been recorded.
I hope these comments may shed some light on the topic and assist current
discussions.
