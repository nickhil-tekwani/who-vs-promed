[1] Maryland - cat, human exposure

The Prince George's County Health Department is alerting residents about a recent rabies exposure in Riverdale Park. On or around 3 Apr 2020, a stray cat scratched a person near the 5800 block of 67th Ave in Riverdale Park. The stray cat is described as an orange tabby, domestic short hair.

The Maryland Department of Health confirmed the cat tested positive for rabies on 8 Apr 2020. The victim exposed to the rabid cat has begun rabies post-exposure treatment. As a precaution, additional stray cats found in the area will be taken in for testing. [Testing an animal means euthanasia for the animal as the brain is what is tested, a good reason to microchip your cat so it is not counted as a stray and can be returned to you. Hopefully, when the alleged stray cat is caught they are being scanned for a microchip so it can be returned to the owner. - Mod.TG]

Due to the risk of rabies exposure, the Health Department asks for help in identifying any persons who may have had contact with the confirmed rabid cat or additional stray cats in the area. If you know of any persons or animals possibly having had contact with the above cat between 22 Mar 2020 and 3 Apr 2020, contact the Prince George's County Health Department.

[3] New York - bat, human exposure

A 2nd bat, this one retrieved from a room in Oneonta where 4 people were sleeping, tested positive for rabies today [1 May 2020], the county Health Department (DOH) announced.

The bat was captured and sent for rabies testing; the people exposed were started on post-exposure treatment.

This is the 2nd local rabies alert: On 14 Apr 2020 a skunk tested positive in the Town of Hartwick.

"Rabies is considered 100 percent fatal once symptoms appear," the announcement said. "It is 100 percent preventable if post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) treatment is started before symptoms and the schedule is adhered to."

According to the DOH, it receives more calls at this time of year of bats in homes because young bats are just starting to fly and can get into homes through narrow gaps in screens, windows and doors, any holes as small as a dime.

A bat found in a home should be tested if it comes into contact with a person, is found in a room with a sleeping person or unattended child, is found close to a child outdoors, or is found in a room with someone under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or someone with a sensory or mental impairment.

Call the health department if you need more information.

[In all 3 cases listed here, the individual is getting post exposure prophylaxis. This is critical to the survival of the person exposed.

Two of these news articles are from the same county, yet there is no mention in either article of any rabies clinic or advice to vaccinate your pets, even if you believe they are indoor-only animals. There are countless stories of a fox or rabid cat or dog racing through a door and biting other indoor animals and their owners. A little bit of digging on the Otsego county websites and a rabies clinic schedule was found at: https://www.otsegocounty.com/2020%20Clinic%20Schedule%20flyer.pdf.

All veterinarians give rabies shots. Regardless of your location, please be sure your animal is appropriately vaccinated against rabies, and your animal can be microchipped at the same time, helping ensure your pet is returned to you if it slips its collar or bolts out the door.

If you should be bitten by an animal, thoroughly wash the wound and seek medical attention. The animal may need to be reported to animal control. If the animal is determined to be rabid, please seek the appropriate post exposure prophylaxis treatment. It must be done within a prescribed amount of time, so do not delay as this is a deadly disease. - Mod.TG
