Norovirus confirmed in BC oysters
---------------------------------
The BC [British Columbia] Centre for Disease Control has confirmed
that an outbreak of illness related to eating uncooked Pacific Coast
oysters is being caused by norovirus [infection].

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency [CFIA] is warning about eating raw
oysters harvested from Effingham Inlet on Vancouver island. The
affected oysters have been traced to a section of Effingham Inlet on
the west coast of Vancouver Island. The oysters were harvested between
7 Sep 2010 and 21 Sep 2010.

A health hazard alert by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency has been
expanded to include oysters from Evening Cove Oysters Processing of
Nanaimo, BC. Other processors already listed in the alert include
Albion Fisheries of Victoria, Albion Fisheries of Vancouver, Pacific
Rim Shellfish of Vancouver, and Sea World Fisheries of Vancouver.

The Centre for Disease Control reports that at least 3 clusters of
illness in the Vancouver area are related to eating uncooked oysters
from Effingham Inlet. Contaminated oysters were traced to a section of
Effingham Inlet, on Vancouver Island.

The number of people who have come down with gastrointestinal ailments
is not being disclosed. Health officials say symptoms that include
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach cramps usually occurred within
48 hours of consuming raw oysters, and lasted a couple of days.

Oysters feed by filtering large amounts of water through their gills.
When the water is contaminated with norovirus, the virus can build up
in the flesh of the oyster. Norovirus -- which can spread from person
to person as well as through tainted food or in water contaminated by
feces -- is a common cause of gastroenteritis, but is rarely fatal.
The virus is killed by cooking.
