In most animal bite cases, patients are administered human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG) injection. However, most hospitals as well as medical stores in the city [Nagpur] don't have this in stock. Administrators say the shortage is a pan-India phenomenon caused by low production of HRIG. This is all the more worrying as India accounts for the largest number of rabies deaths in the world.

In the period between April 2014 and March 2015, more than 6000 people in the city were bitten by dogs. In the 3 months since, almost 2000 people have been bitten. Most victims prefer going to government hospitals, all of which have a well functioning rabies clinic. However, none of the public sector hospitals in the city, neither those run by state government nor those run by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), stock HRIG.

"Medical stores don't stock them because of low demand. Since most victims of animal bites don't go to private practitioners, and government hospitals have their own stock of drugs and injections, even if we stock them, these injections expire before we can sell them. Being expensive, it is risky for retailers to stock them only to be wasted," said Jagannath Shinde, president of the Maharashtra State Chemist and Distributor's Association. [But see comment below].

An official from Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) responsible for procurement of medicines said that their order for HRIG had remained unfulfilled since months. "Our rate card only permits us to buy the injection from one company called Bharat Serum. It has been months since we last sent them an order for HRIG. We heard the company had stopped producing the injections but no such communication has been made to us," he said.

Another doctor at the rabies clinic in a government hospital said shortage of HRIG must not be based on the number of victims. "Not all of them require immunoglobulin. It is only needed in wounds described as Class III, a categorization based on several factors including type of wound, site, number of wounds, depth and type of animal responsible for the bite," he said. He did say the high number of deaths due to rabies was sad, as although the disease is 100 percent fatal, it is also 100 percent preventable.

A study by Global Alliance for Rabies Control's Partners for Rabies Prevention Group released earlier this year [2015] said there were over 20 000 rabies related human deaths annually in India. It also said the number of dogs vaccinated in the country was much lower than even those in sub-Saharan African countries.

A fatal shortage
-----------
Rabies immunoglobulin: Human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG) is administered to patients bitten by dogs or other wild animals. It is indicated for all people having Class III wounds. It contains antibodies that a patient with severe bite requires immediately before the body can produce antibodies of its own.

HRIB is recommended in case of being bitten by a rabid dog, in unvaccinated victims of dog bites, with bites on sensitive areas like joints, very deep wounds, and bites inflicted by wild animals or rodents. In absence, the patient is unable to produce antibodies to fight the rabies virus, which is fatal.

Dog-bite cases in the city:
--------------------
April 2014-March 2015: 6403
April 2015-June 2015: 1971

[CDC characterises rabies exposure as follows http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/exposure/type.html:

"What type of exposure occurred?
------------------------
Rabies is transmitted only when the virus is introduced into a bite wound, open cuts in skin, or onto mucous membranes such as the mouth or eyes.

Other factors to consider when evaluating a potential rabies exposure include the natural occurrence in the area, the biting animal's history and current health status (e.g., abnormal behavior, signs of illness), and the potential for the animal to be exposed to rabies (e.g., presence of an unexplained wound or history of exposure to a rabid animal).

A currently vaccinated dog, cat, or ferret is unlikely to become infected with rabies.

When an exposure has occurred, the likelihood of rabies infection varies with the nature and extent of that exposure. Under most circumstances, 2 categories of exposure -- bite and nonbite -- should be considered.

Bite
--
Any penetration of the skin by teeth constitutes a bite exposure. All bites, regardless of body site, represent a potential risk of rabies transmission, but that risk varies with the species of biting animal, the anatomic site of the bite, and the severity of the wound. Bites by some animals, such as bats, can inflict minor injury and thus be difficult to detect.

Was the bite from a provoked or an unprovoked attack? Bites inflicted on a person attempting to feed or handle an apparently healthy animal should generally be regarded as provoked. If it was an unprovoked attack, that's more likely to indicate that the animal is rabid.

Nonbite
-----
The contamination of open wounds, abrasions, mucous membranes, or theoretically, scratches (potentially contaminated with infectious material from a rabid animal) constitutes a nonbite exposure. Nonbite exposures from terrestrial animals rarely cause rabies. However, occasional reports of rabies transmission by nonbite exposures suggest that such exposures should be evaluated for possible post-exposure prophylaxis administration.

Other contact by itself, such as petting a rabid animal and contact with blood, urine, or feces of a rabid animal, does not constitute an exposure and is not an indication for post-exposure vaccination."

This report echoes a similar one of Kerala in January of this year (2015) and very probably reflects a notional concern; see 20141219.3042512. It is a worrying and concerning problem for the Nagpur. In the relative absence of HRIG, a partial solution would be to increase the dog vaccination, which would reduce the potential number of rabid biting dogs and the need for human treatment. Members are advised to read Merritt Clifton's comments in 20150211.3160288.

Nagpur is deep inside the state of Maharashtra; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagpur. It is the 2nd capital and the 3rd largest city of the Indian state of Maharashtra after Mumbai and Pune. It is the 9th largest urban agglomeration in India and the largest city in Vidarbha. Nagpur got a boost when it was selected in the MIHAN project, but still it lacks in industrial development when compared to other rich regions in Maharashtra, including the green belt of Pune and Nashik along with Aurangabad city. - Mod.MHJ]
