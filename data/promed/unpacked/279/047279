[In 2010, Mozambique submitted an immediate notification report on foot and mouth disease (FMD). In this event, 11 outbreaks were reported involving FMD serotype SAT-2. The event was resolved on 30 Jun 2011 (see final report at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000011481_20130516_181313.pdf).

The event summary and map are available at http://tinyurl.com/llzlofz.

Although many species of cloven-hoofed wildlife may become infected, African buffaloes (_Syncerus caffer_) are the only wildlife species which plays a significant role in the epidemiology of FMD. Spillover of infection into livestock occurs periodically. See http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.05_FMD.pdf and http://tinyurl.com/klauszb.
