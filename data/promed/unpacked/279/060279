White nose syndrome [WNS], a fungal disease that has killed millions of bats in the eastern United States since it was 1st detected in 2006, continues its deadly spread in North Carolina. During winter bat surveys in January and February [2017], biologists with the NC Wildlife Resources Commission and NC State Parks, documented the 1st case of WNS in Stokes County, which marks the farthest east record of WNS in North Carolina and the 1st record of visible WNS in the Piedmont.

Historically, biologists had conducted most bat surveys in the western part of the state because that is where the most bat hibernacula (caves and mines) are found. However, this winter, biologists expanded the survey range to include hibernacula across the state.

In the Stokes County hibernaculum, they found 4 tricolored bats with visible signs of WNS -- a whitish, fuzzy fungus growing on their noses, wings and ears. The only other documentation of WNS outside of the mountains in North Carolina was a site in Stanly County that tested positive for the WNS fungus in 2015. However, during subsequent surveys in 2016 and 2017, biologists found no bats exhibiting the telltale signs of WNS. Just to be certain the Stanly County site was WNS free, they took swabs from bats this year [2017] and submitted them for testing. Results, which came back this week [week of Sun 21 may 2017], indicate WNS was present only in the bats from Stokes County.

While the results provided a bit of good news in an otherwise bleak situation, biologists continued to see low numbers of bats in all the caves and mines they surveyed in western North Carolina, indicating that the large declines in bat populations have already occurred, according to mammalogist Katherine Caldwell. "What we're seeing now at these sites is WNS' devastating aftermath," Caldwell said. "Most sites we surveyed in western North Carolina had over 90 per cent declines in bat populations from their pre-WNS counts, with some declines as high as 99 per cent."

While the steep declines of bat populations in western North Carolina are dismaying, the surveys did reveal a bit of good news: bats in the Piedmont and Coastal Plain were faring better than their western counterparts. "While we don't have as much data on sites in the Piedmont and Coastal Plain, we did document the highest number of bats at 2 of the sites that we have been monitoring for the past 4 years," Caldwell said. "Even better, we found a cave in Onslow County that had 8 hibernating tri-colored bats, all of which appeared to be WNS free. Caves are relatively unknown in the Coastal Plain so it was real treat to be able to survey this cave."

Biologists 1st detected WNS in North Carolina in February 2011, in a bat from Avery County. Since that time, the disease has been found in 10 counties in western North Carolina, though WNS is likely present throughout the mountains based on bat decline data. WNS has been found in 8 bat species, but the largest population declines have occurred in 4 species -- northern long-eared, little brown, tricolored, and Indiana bat. The other 4 species affected by WNS are big brown, gray, eastern small-footed, and southeastern bat. Why some bat species are hit harder by WNS than others is still a mystery to biologists, but several hypotheses are currently being tested.

"We know that this fungus only grows in a narrow temperature range, between 41-56 degrees Fahrenheit [5-13 degrees Celsius], in high-humidity conditions like those of a cave/mine so only cave hibernators are at risk," Caldwell said. "But some species that hibernate in caves are not affected even though they hibernate in caves where other species have the disease. As the disease continues to spread west across the continent, other species could be affected. We really just don't know at this point."

Neither the disease nor the fungus that causes it has been detected in any of the so-called tree roosting bats, which typically roost individually in or on trees in the warmer months and either migrate south for the winter or remain in the area, hibernating individually outside of caves. The disease has not been detected in the 2 species of big-eared bats that occur in North Carolina, including the federally endangered Virginia big-eared bat.

While WNS has a deadly effect on bats, it does not affect people -- at least not directly. Indirectly, however, it can have a huge impact on humans by reducing the number of bats in North American ecosystems. "Bats in these ecosystems are insectivorous and may consume their body weight in insects in a single night," Caldwell said. "Many insects eaten by bats are crop and forest pests." The US Geological Service estimates that loss of bats in North America could lead to agricultural losses exceeding USD 3.7 billion annually.

Biologists will continue their long-term monitoring efforts of bats in North Carolina, concentrating their efforts on caves and mines in the Piedmont and Coastal Plain. But first they need to find hibernacula to survey -- a task that is easier said than done, according to Caldwell.
