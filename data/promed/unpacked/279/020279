Thailand: 3rd Suspected Human Case of Avian Influenza Reported
-----------------------------------------------
A 19-year-old chicken farm worker in Uthai Thani province who buried
dead birds without wearing proper protection has been put under
hospital surveillance and is suspected of being the 3rd person
infected with avian influenza in Thailand in the past 2 weeks, after
a 2nd man was confirmed to have died of the disease in the same
province over the weekend.
According to caretaker Health Minister Phinij Jarusombat, who
inspected bird flu-infected areas in Uthai Thani province yesterday
[6 Aug 2006], the latest victim fell sick last Thursday [3 Aug 2006]
and was admitted to Uthai Thani provincial hospital on Saturday. The
results of tests to verify whether the unidentified man is actually
infected with the deadly H5N1 virus are expected to be known today [7
Aug 2006].
Phinij said the man, who was working on a chicken farm with 20 000
birds in Uthai Thani's Muang district, might have contracted the
disease after burying dead birds late last month [July 2006] while
not wearing protective gear. The Minister said he had given strict
instructions to about 800 000 public health volunteers throughout the
country to inform villagers to exercise extreme caution when handling
dead birds. "Villagers should not handle dead birds. But if they have
to, they must wear rubber gloves or several layers of plastic bags,
and they must absolutely not eat any sick or dead birds," Phinij said.
Starting today [7 Aug 2006], the Ministry will also launch a national
cleanliness campaign that encourages people to wash their hands
frequently. The 3rd suspected human case came after the Minister
confirmed on Saturday [5 Aug 2006] that a 27-year-old man who died
last Thursday [3 Aug 2006] in Uthai Thani's Sawang Arom district had
succumbed to the H5N1 virus, making him the 2nd person to have died
of the disease this year [2006]. The 1st case was reported in Phichit
province on 26 Jul 2006.
Public Health Permanent Secretary Dr. Prat Boonyawongvirot said that
in the light of the latest outbreak in Uthai Thani, the provincial
hospital there has now been equipped with special facilities to
handle suspected bird flu patients and test for the virus. He added
that public health volunteers had been instructed to monitor the
symptoms of any unwell villagers and report their findings every
morning.
Dr. Prat added that the Ministry would no longer issue daily
reports on suspected patients who are under medical surveillance as
there are too many of them, and the list of names changes daily. He
said the Ministry will only issue announcements when bird flu or
serious human influenza cases are confirmed.
Meanwhile, the Director-general of the Disease Control Department,
Dr. Thawat Suntrajarn, said Bangkok-based medical experts met with
provincial doctors yesterday [6 Aug 2006] and mapped out plans to
speed up the handling of suspected human bird-flu cases. Patients
suffering from fever and cough who are known to have handled sick or
dead birds will be given oseltamivir phosphate, a generic version of
Roche Pharmaceuticals' Tamiflu that is now being produced locally,
even if initial tests are negative, he said. According to Dr. Thawat,
80 people, mainly Uthai Thani provincial hospital staff or villagers
living in the vicinity of the 2nd victim, are currently undergoing 14
days of medical surveillance after receiving the local version of
Tamiflu.

[The announcement by the Thai Ministry of Health (MOH) that it will
no longer give daily reports of numbers of individuals under
observation is an important development. The number of so-called
suspected cases has fluctuated wildly from none on 1 Aug 2006 to 3944
on 6 Aug 2006, possibly due to an increasing prevalence of ordinary
(seasonal) human influenza in the country. This number has been a
field day for irresponsible sensationalists. The more realistic
number are cases confirmed by Thai MOH testing. The case described
above falls into this category and ranks as a valid suspected case.
The Thai MOH has equipped all areas with rapid influenza tests so
there can be rapid confirmation of H5N1 avian influenza cases, and
their backup confirmatory testing for H5N1 takes less than a day
later, including the transportation to a lab that can do the H5N1
testing. The Thai MOH is being transparent about H5N1 activity in
humans, but there may still be a delay on the veterinary side due to
local logistical problems rather than national policy.
