[Crayfish fungal plague, fatal to many crayfish species, has affected many European countries. It is caused by a fungus _Aphanomyces astaci_ that was brought into Europe by the introduction of _Procambarus clarkii_, a freshwater crayfish species from Louisiana, USA, which is naturally infected by this pathogen although it does not develop clinical disease.

The white-clawed crayfish, or European freshwater crayfish (_Austropotamobius pallipes_), is an endangered species. For a picture, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austropotamobius_pallipes#/media/File:Austropotamobius_pallipes.jpg.

For detailed information about the disease caused by this fungus, see http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/current/chapitre_aphanomyces_astaci.pdf. - Mod.PMB
