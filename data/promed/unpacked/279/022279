Two deer from a hunting ranch in Waupaca County have tested positive for chronic wasting disease.

The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection says one of the bucks was killed by a hunter, and the other was euthanized because of an injury. Neither one showed signs of CWD when it was alive. The animals, ages 2 and 3, were among 40 deer reported to be on Hunt's End East's 84-acre ranch.

Both deer were sampled and sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa, which found CWD in the deer. DATCP rules require farm-raised deer and elk to be tested after they are killed.

State veterinarian Paul McGraw put the ranch, as well as 2 others that are owned by the same people, under quarantine. That means deer can move between the ranches and to slaughter, but nowhere else. Hunts will still be allowed on the ranches, because DATCP believes properly handled dead deer leaving the ranches are safe.

DATCP's Animal Health Division plans an investigation to examine the deer's history and trace deer movements to see whether other herds have been exposed to the CWD-positive deer.

[It is difficult to tell whether this an expansion of the disease.

According to the Wisconsin map http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/wildlifehabitat/documents/surveillanceplan.pdf, there was a 10-mile surveillance around an area with captive cervids in the same county. Chronic wasting disease has been found in both captive and wild cervids. - Mod.TG
