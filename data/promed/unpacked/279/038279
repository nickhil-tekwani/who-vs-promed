Cattle disease ravages Western Province
----------------------------------------
Farmers in Western Province have in the last 4 days lost a large number of
cattle to a suspected contaminated vaccine used to combat contagious bovine
pleuropneumonia (CBPP). Western Province minister, Simasiku Namakando,
confirmed the loss of many head of cattle in an interview from Mongu yesterday.
Mr Namakando, who described the matter as a crisis, said a team of
veterinary officers was yesterday dispatched to the area to investigate the
cause of the deaths. He said that, while the vaccination programme was
going on smoothly in other parts of the province, he was concerned at the
losses of cattle in the Mulobezi area. "The situation is worrying because
farmers in Sichili village area in Sesheke district have continued to lose
cattle in large numbers, but we have since sent a team of doctors on a
fact-finding mission in the area," he said.
Mr Simasiku said that the result of the deaths would be ascertained only
after the veterinary officers had reported their findings. He said
agriculture minister Mundia Sikatana had already been to the affected area.
When contacted, Mr Sikatana said he had received the reports, but there was
insufficient evidence on the matter to confirm whether the cause of the
death was the vaccine or something [else].
The minister also reiterated that the government would prosecute farmers
who disobeyed the cattle movement ban currently in force. He said the
outbreaks of cattle diseases in Southern Province had mostly been the
result of unlawful movement of cattle from various areas.

[While recent cases in Zambia have been reported in the Southern Province
(see ref 20040331.0882 and Zambia's notification to the Office
International des Epizooties (OIE) of 8 Apr 2004,
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_50.HTM#Sec5>), the above allegedly
vaccine-related losses come from the Western Province. The suspected role
of contaminated vaccine in the cattle losses needs to be substantiated by
thorough epidemiological and laboratory investigations. If the same
batch(es) of the CBPP vaccine have been used in other areas without
deleterious effects, other causes should not be ruled out.
Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) is a disease of cattle caused by
_Mycoplasma mycoides_ subsp. _mycoides_ SC (small colony), bovine biotype.
According to OIE's "Manual of standards, Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines
2000", Chapter 2.1.6., only one strain is recommended for preparing CBPP
vaccines: strain T1/44, a naturally mild strain isolated in 1951 by Sheriff
& Piercy in Tanzania. The 44th egg-passage is sufficiently attenuated to
protect cattle without post-vaccination severe reactions. Post-vaccination
reactions may occur at the inoculation site. Cattle breeds should be
assessed for their sensitivity before mass vaccination. Further details,
including safety testing requirements, are to be seen at
<http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00027.htm>. - Mod.AS].
