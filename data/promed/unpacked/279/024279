A total of 9 animals from 3 different farms have been sent to the [Finnish]
National Veterinary and Food Research Institute (EELA) for necropsy.
According to their history, the blue foxes had shown signs of unsteady
movement, hind leg paralysis developing to a complete paralysis, and finally
death.
The total number of affected farms is about 50-60 with all having the same
feed source. The estimated number of affected animals is about 20 000 with
about 25 percent mortality so far. Fewer minks have been affected. Most of
the minks have been vaccinated with botulinum toxoid. The silver foxes have
remained healthy. Thus there appears to be a species difference in terms of
susceptibility between the blue fox and silver fox. They have been
developed from 2 different species, the arctic fox and red fox,
respectively.
There were no specific macroscopic findings from the necropsies. Samples for
bacteriology, virology, histology, and toxicology were taken. Currently,
botulism is considered the most likely cause for the outbreak. Preliminary
results of toxicological testing are expected later this week.
