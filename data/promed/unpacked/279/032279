2004/167 1st report of Pepino mosaic potexvirus in Hungary
----------------------------------------
In spring 2004, Pepino mosaic potexvirus (PepMV - EPPO Alert List) was
detected in a glasshouse of tomatoes in central Hungary. PepMV was detected
on the basis of symptoms, transmission to tomato seedlings and serological
tests (ELISA with specific antisera for PepMV). This is the 1st report of
Pepino mosaic potexvirus in Hungary. Studies are being done to characterize
the Hungarian isolate of PepMV.

[It is no surprise that PepMV has appeared in Hungary. PepMV is extremely
infectious, and I suspect that infected tomato transplants or
PepMV-contaminated tomato seed were used at the production site. As part of
my research mandate at Agriculture & Agri-Food Canada, I tested seeds of
several popular Hungarian tomato cultivars that had been imported to
British Columbia for planting in the Richmond area, and most of them were
contaminated with PepMV. 1st detected in pepino (_Solanum muricatum_)
growing along the coastal regions of Peru in 1980, it was identified in
1999 as the causal agent of a severe tomato disease in commercial
greenhouses in the Netherlands and has been reported as a serious problem
in greenhouse tomatoes throughout Europe, Canada, and the United States.
Disease management depends on use of virus-free seed and transplants, and
non-infested equipment. To minimize the risk of spread and carryover of
PepMV in greenhouses where the disease already occurs, it is essential to
maintain strict hygiene at all stages of crop production and thorough
clean-up procedures between crops.
