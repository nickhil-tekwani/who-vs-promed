Report type: Immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 6 Mar 2019
Date of confirmation of the event: 10 Mar 2019
Reason for notification: Recurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 18 Apr 2018
Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease
Causal agent: Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H7N3
Nature of diagnosis: Laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Acolman, Mexico
Date of start of the outbreak: 6 Mar 201918
Outbreak status: Resolved 22 Mar 2019
Epidemiological unit: Backyard
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Birds / 150 / 150 / 150 / 0 / 0
Affected population: A backyard with 150 native birds; it was detected following high mortality and clinical signs suggesting the disease (cyanosis, edema and swelling on the crest and barbels and sudden death).

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Birds / 100 / 100 / 100 / 100
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Comments: Carcasses of the birds were disposed of according to health standards within the affected premises, and the premises were cleaned, washed and disinfected. Surveillance of the premises located around the outbreak is ongoing, and there has been no evidence of sick or dead birds. It should be noted that the State of Mexico has a low prevalence health status; accordingly, vaccination against the avian influenza virus H7N3 can be applied, as previously authorized by SENASICA.

Control measures
Measures applied: Movement control inside the country; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: SENASICA Level 3 Biosecurity Laboratory (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Birds / Intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) test / 10 Mar 2019 / Positive
Birds / Virus isolation / 8 Mar 2019 / Positive
Birds / Virus sequencing / 22 Mar 2019 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[In February 2018, Mexico reported an event of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in which serotype H7N3 was also identified. A total of 4 outbreaks were reported. The outbreaks were located in the states of Guanajuato and Queretaro. The event was declared resolved on [18 Apr 2018]. The comments made in the epidemiological section in Mexico's final report note that "In the 4 outbreaks reported in 2018, all birds were killed and disposed of, carcasses, by-products and waste were officially disposed of, and the facilities were cleaned and disinfected. The quarantines in force were lifted when, through sentinelization, was checked that the virus was not circulating. The virus isolated in the premises in Irapuato, Guanajuato, showed an IVPI of 2.95, while the one in Pedro Escobedo, Queretaro, showed an IVPI of 2.86. The last quarantine to be lifted was that of the affected premises in San Felipe, Guanajuato, due to the fact that the sampling from sentinel birds obtained a suspicious result for the virus. The birds were therefore disposed of on 31 May [2018] and measures against the outbreak were re-implemented (disposal of carcasses and waste, cleaning, washing and disinfection of facilities, sentinelization). Sampling of the 2nd sentinelization was negative, demonstrating the absence of the virus, and the restrictions were lifted on 13 Sep [2018]. In accordance with Article 10.4.4 of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code and since the 3-month period without outbreaks have elapsed, this event is considered closed. Epidemiological surveillance continues at local and national levels" (see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=28427).
