Brote de Carbunco /Jovita-Cordoba-Argentina
-------------------------------------------
An estancia in Jovita, Province of Cordoba, has suffered a severe
outbreak of anthrax involving 35 dead/170 hybrid cattle as well as in
3 farm dogs being clinically affected; one dog has died. The cattle
had not been vaccinated as the area is not known for anthrax. All the
dead animal manifested extravasations of blood from their natural
orifices. To date the carcasses have yet to be disposed of but it is
planned to handle them in the traditional 'Tapado Controlado' manner.

[The Argentine 'Tapado Controlado' involves covering the carcass with
agricultural lime; then placing a thick plastic tarp over it, weighed
down around the whole margin; and left to decompose for 9 months when
the bones and any remaining tissues are removed and burnt or buried.

In the US there are a number of states which practice carcass
composting. Apparently "in animal composting, the carcass is placed in
an above-ground bin and covered with wooden material similar to chips,
which has microorganisms that eat the carcass and generate heat. That
both sterilizes and speeds up decomposition. Complex chains of smelly
gases break down so no smell is emitted -- only water in the form of
steam. There also is some carbon dioxide emitted and a hint of
ammonia. The end result is used as fertilizer." See:

I have requested details from Cornell Waste Management Institute in
Ithaca, N.Y., but have yet to get a reply as to safety concerns if one
were to compost anthrax carcasses.

The disease is sporadic in Cordoba Province with outbreaks reported
in 2004, 2006 (3), and 2008 (1). - Mod.MHJ]
