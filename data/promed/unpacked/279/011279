The _E. coli_ [O157] outbreak linked to raw milk from a farm near Wilsonville expanded Tue 17 Apr 2012, with state health officials reporting more illnesses and another child hospitalized with kidney failure.

At least 18 people who consumed milk from Foundation Farm have developed gastro-intestinal symptoms, said Dr Katrina Hedberg, state epidemiologist. So far, 4 of them, including a 1-year-old, have been hospitalized with hemolytic-uremic syndrome, a kind of acute kidney failure. "These kids are very ill," she said.

That bad news followed official confirmation linking Foundation Farm to the outbreak. Lab tests turned up _E. coli_ O157:H7 in the farm's milk and in environmental samples collected at the property last week [week of 9 Apr 2012]. "The lab results confirmed what we already knew," she said. "We are not surprised."

This is Oregon's 6th raw milk outbreak since 1993 and comes on the heels of another _E. coli_ outbreak in Missouri linked to unpasteurized milk.

The tests, conducted at a lab near Seattle that specializes in foodborne illnesses, found _E. coli_ O157:H7 in manure samples from the farm. They also turned up in rectal swabs from 2 of 4 cows. But the most telling sign of all: They were in the milk.

Harmful bacteria are not usually widespread in a product. To find it, epidemiologists have to test a contaminated sample. In this case, that means catching it in a few drops of milk. "The fact that it was found in the milk itself shows that it was probably contaminated at a high level," Hedberg said.

Retail sales of raw cow's milk were banned by the Oregon Legislature in 1999 following 4 illness outbreaks between 1993 and 1997. But sales at small farms with no more than 2 lactating cows are allowed, provided they don't advertise.

Foundation Farm sold raw milk to 48 families through a program in which they bought shares in a herd. Herd-share programs in Oregon are not regulated. "We know they exist, and we know that for people who want access to raw milk that's an option for them," said Bruce Pokarney, spokesman for the state Department of Agriculture.

Jim Krahn, executive director of the Oregon Dairy Farmers Association, estimates there are 40 to 50 cow-share programs in Oregon. He said they sprung up in response to the state's ban on raw cow milk sales as a way to circumvent the law.

He said all dairy producers, large and small, fight bacterial contamination. They clean cow's teats before milking but, he said, there is always a risk of bacteria from the hair on the udders getting into the milking device when it's put in place. Then the milk has to be cooled down immediately to prevent any bacteria from multiplying. Many small farms can't afford expensive refrigeration equipment, he said.

[The number of cases in this outbreak has grown substantially and isolation of the pathogen has been made from the dairy farm environment, from the cows and from the milk itself. This essentially preventable vehicle for _E. coli_ O157:H7 continues to occur as currently manifest by outbreaks in Oregon and in Missouri.

Unpasteurized dairy products are well known sources of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ as well as a large selection of other pathogenic microbes including zoonotic organisms such as _Brucella abortus_, _B. melitensis_, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ species, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ species, _Yersinia_ species, and _Coxiella burnetii_. Pathogenic microbes also include non-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_ Typhi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ species, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from _Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A. - Mod.LL
