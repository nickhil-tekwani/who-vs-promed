The Florida Department of Health in Levy County (DOH-Levy) today [8 Mar 2018] issued a mosquito-borne illness alert for Levy County. A case of eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] has been confirmed in a flock of Emus in the Bronson area, and there is a heightened concern residents could become ill.

EEE is spread to horses and humans [and emus] by infected mosquitoes, including several _Culex_ species and _Culiseta melanura_.

Symptoms of EEE disease often appear 4 to 10 days after someone is bitten by an infected mosquito.

EEE is a more serious disease than West Nile virus (WNV) and carries a high mortality rate for those who contract the serious encephalitis form of the illness. Symptoms may include high fever, severe headache, stiff neck, and sore throat. There is no specific treatment for the disease, which can lead to seizures and coma.

DOH-Levy continues to advise the public to remain diligent in their personal mosquito protection efforts by remembering to "Drain and Cover."

DRAIN standing water to stop mosquitoes from multiplying.
- Drain water from garbage cans, house gutters, buckets, pool covers, coolers, toys, flower pots or any other containers where sprinkler or rain water has collected.
- Discard old tires, drums, bottles, cans, pots and pans, broken appliances and other items that aren't being used.
- Empty and clean birdbaths and pet's water bowls at least once or twice a week
- Protect boats and vehicles from rain with tarps that don't accumulate water.
- Maintain swimming pools in good condition and appropriately chlorinated. Empty plastic swimming pools when not in use.
-
COVER skin with clothing or repellent.
- Clothing - Wear shoes, socks, and long pants and long-sleeves. This type of protection may be necessary for people who must work in areas where mosquitoes are present.
- Repellent - Apply mosquito repellent to bare skin and clothing.
- Always use repellents according to the label. Repellents with DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, and IR3535 are effective.
- Use mosquito netting to protect children younger than 2 months old.

COVER doors and windows with screens to keep mosquitoes out of your house.
- Repair broken screening on windows, doors, porches, and patios.

State health officials said Friday [9 Mar 2018] that 2 horses in Levy County and one in Marion County have tested positive for EEE.

Wesley Asbell, a health department official who covers Levy, Dixie and Gilchrist Counties, said he received confirmation of the Levy horses' test results on Thursday [8 Mark 2018].

"I guess we've just got an early virus circulating," he said.

EEE is mosquito-borne virus 1st recognized in humans in 1938. It cycles between mosquitoes and birds in freshwater and swampy areas and is capable of infecting mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles. The disease is 80 to 90 percent fatal in horses and 30 to 45 percent fatal in humans. Symptoms develop 3 to 10 days after the bite of an infected mosquito. The state averages more than 60 reported cases of the virus [in horses] and 1 to 2 human cases annually.

Health officials encourage basic precautions to help limit exposure to the virus, including wearing long pants and long-sleeved shirts outdoors, using mosquito spray, and draining standing water that could attract or breed mosquitoes.

A flock of emus also have been infected with EEE in the Bronson area.

[Neither of these articles mentioned that horse owners should vaccinate, and vaccinate now if it has not already been done. Generally, vaccination is recommended prior to the mosquito (vector) season, so Florida appears to behind on recommending vaccinations. EEE is often combined with vaccinations for western equine encephalitis (WEE) and for West Nile virus (WNV).

This is very early in the year to have confirmed cases and could be a bad year for these mosquito-borne viruses. Please vaccinate your animals.

According the American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) https://aaep.org/guidelines/vaccination-guidelines/core-vaccination-guidelines/easternwestern-equine-encephalomyelitis:

"Adult horses previously vaccinated against EEE/WEE: Annual revaccination must be completed prior to vector season in the spring. In animals of high risk or with limited immunity, more frequent vaccination or appropriately timed vaccination is recommended in order to induce protective immunity during periods of likely exposure. In areas where mosquitoes are active year-round, many veterinarians elect to vaccinate horses at 4- to 6-month intervals to ensure uniform protection throughout the year, although this practice is not specifically recommended by manufacturers of vaccines.

Adult horses, previously unvaccinated against EEE/WEE or of unknown vaccinal history: Administer a primary series of 2 doses with a 4 to 6 week interval between doses. Revaccinate prior to the onset of the next vector season and annually thereafter.

Pregnant mares, previously vaccinated against EEE/WEE: Vaccinate 4 to 6 weeks before foaling.

Pregnant mares, unvaccinated or having unknown vaccinal history: Immediately begin a 2-dose primary series with a 4-week interval between doses. Booster at 4 to 6 weeks before foaling or prior to the onset of the next vector season--whichever occurs 1st.

Foals of mares vaccinated against EEE/WEE in the pre-partum period: Administer a primary 3-dose series beginning at 4 to 6 months of age. A 4 to 6 week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses is recommended. The 3rd dose should be administered at 10 to 12 months of age prior to the onset of the next mosquito season.

In the southeastern U.S., due to earlier seasonal disease risk, vaccination may be started at 2 to 3 months of age. When initiating vaccinations in younger foals, a series of 4 primary doses should be administered, with a 4-week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses and between the 2nd and 3rd doses. The 4th dose should be administered at 10 to 12 months of age prior to the onset of the next mosquito season.

Foals of unvaccinated mares or having unknown vaccinal history: Administer a primary series of 3 doses with a 4-week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses and an 8-week interval between the 2nd and 3rd doses. If the primary series is initiated during the mosquito vector season, an interval of 3 to 4 weeks between the 2nd and 3rd doses is preferable to the above described interval of 8 weeks.

NOTE: Foals in the Southeastern USA - The primary vaccination series should be initiated at 3 months of age due to early seasonal vector presence.

Horses having been naturally infected and recovered: Recovered horses likely develop lifelong immunity. Consider revaccination only if the immune status of the animal changes the risk of susceptibility to infection. Examples of these conditions would include the long-term use of corticosteroids and equine pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID)". - Mod.TG
