Hundreds of people were taken to hospital after contracting a skin
disease during lead up events for the Boryeong Mud Festival in [South]
Korea. Some 200 out of 1500 participants suffered skin inflammations
while they were undergoing mud baths in the South Korean city.

In one case, some 50 students of a grade school complained of
dermatitis symptoms. A number foreign tourists, including American GIs
[soldiers], also suffered from dermatitis.

The Boryeong Mud Festival, on the banks of Daecheon Stream, has become
an international event, attracting visitors from throughout the world.
The town fathers and mothers discovered that the mud is more lucrative
as a tourist attraction than using the muddy fields for agriculture.
As a result they set up mud baths, mud slides and competitions
including mud wrestling and escaping a mud prison. The economy
generated from the festival supports the many hotels and restaurants
along the waterway. The festival is a free-for-all in the mud-covered
city, held this year, from 11-19 Jul 20099.

Thousands of holidaymakers have been enjoying the Boryeong Mud
Festival on the country's western coast, shrugging off news that
hundreds of children developed skin trouble in pre-opening events. The
regional health agency has yet to determine the exact cause of the
skin inflammations suffered by about 230 children after participating
in the pre-events between 4-5 Jul 2009.

Research is being conducted on samples of mud, water and other
substances, with results expected as early as Tuesday [14 Jul 2009].

"For now, we presume it's because of some contaminated water coming
from Daecheon Stream and an unhygienic environment downtown," a
festival organizer told The Korea Times Sunday [12 Jul 2009]. The
official insisted the mud itself was safe and the festival was going
ahead on Daecheon Beach as scheduled. "We are using cleaner water and
strengthening all sanitary steps so tourists don't have to worry about
it."

Some children are still being treated with several symptoms, including
itching and rashes, most of them are elementary school students who
were on a field trip. The pre-events took place on the embankment of
Daecheon Stream in Boryeong City, South Chungcheong Province, to
promote the official mud festival at the beach. Opened in 1998, it has
been one of the most popular seasonal events in the region.

[The etiology or etiologies of these presumed skin infections is not
yet reported. A 2002 outbreak of cutaenous infection caused by
_Aeromonas hydrophila_ (1) occurred in 26 of about 100 persons in
southwest Western Australia who participated in a mud football game.
The field had been inundated with water from an adjacent river and the
organism was isolated from the river as well. The investigators could
identify only one other report of a cluster of skin infections linked
to mud exposure. In this report (2), several Enterobacteriaceae
including _Enterobacter_ and _Citrobacter_ were isolated from college
students with a pustular dermatitis following mud wrestling, a process
that the authors called _dermatitis palaestrae limosae_ (dermatitis of
muddy wrestling).

The cause of the present cluster may well be a Gram-negative bacillus
as well. Melioidosis (a systemic infection caused by _Burkholderia
pseudomallei_) is endemic in parts of southeastern Asia and northern
Australia but the 1st case in Korea was not reported until 2005 (3)
and should not present as just a cluster of cutaneous cases as here.

Other systemic infections have been reported to have been spread
through contaminated mud. As examples, campylobacteriosis has occurred
associated with cyclists exposed during a race (4,5) and _E. coli_
O157 has occurred during a music festival (6), all 3 linked to
contaminated mud.

Finally, there is a formal infection called mud fever, a disease of
horses causing irritation and dermatitis in the lower limbs of horses.
Often caused by a mixture of bacteria, typically _Dermatophilus
congolensis_, and _Staphylococcus_ spp., mud fever can also be caused
by fungal organisms (dermatophytes). Photosensitization, chorioptic
mange mites, contact dermatitis and other conditions also contribute
to some cases. This condition is often called scratches or dew
poisoning, but is also known as pastern dermatitis, grease heel, or
greasy heel (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mud_fever>).

Boryeong (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boryeong>) in South
Chungcheong Province, South Korea, is known around Korea for its
beaches, particularly Daecheon Beach, and its annual mud festival
around July, Boryeong Mud Festival. The city's beach-mud is widely
touted for its cosmetic properties. The province (Ch'ungCh'ong Nam-do)
