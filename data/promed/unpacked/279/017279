Krüger National Park management warns about malaria. Recently reported cases of malaria in Mpumalangas Ehlanzeni District Municipality led to the park management cautioning visitors to take the necessary precautionary measures.

One day ago [Wed 11 Oct 2017] several malaria cases were recently reported in Krüger National Park including the southern part of the park. Park management hence cautions visitors to take the necessary precautionary measures, like using prophylaxes or vaccinations and to avoid exposing the skin whilst outside in the evenings.

Communications and marketing general manager William Mabasa says the active malaria season started in October, with March and April the highest risk periods. "Visitors who contract malaria after visiting the park should immediately report it to our doctors in Skukuza to assist the recording and identifying of affected areas."

He also advised visitors to consult resident medical doctors in Skukuza for information and advice prior to their visit to the Park.

They can be reached on +27 13 735 5638.

[The latest advice from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases, Pretoria, from the [Thu 12 Oct 2017] state that: "The Kruger National Park management would like to advise visitors to the Park about the risk of malaria and precautionary measures to be taken. Although there is some risk throughout the year, the annual high malaria season (September to May) has started, and above-average numbers of cases have been reported from areas surrounding the Park in the Limpopo and Mpumalanga provinces. This has resulted in concerns about a modest increase in the risk to Park staff and visitors". See: http://www.nicd.ac.za/index.php/malaria-advisory-for-visitors-to-the-kruger-national-park/.
This is the Krüger National Park border with Mozambique where there is malaria and there is a small risk as stated in the rainy season. - Mod.EP
