A well-known watercolor artist, died last week [week of 16 Dec 2013] of Powassan virus [infection] after being bitten by a tick in early November [2013]. Her daughter said the virus was particularly virulent, with her 73-year-old mother quickly getting weaker, vomiting, developing a high fever and meningitis, lapsing into delirium, becoming paralyzed, and requiring a ventilator to breathe. "She just kept getting sicker and sicker," the artist's daughter said, and her mother died at Maine Medical Center on 18 Dec 2013. Powassan virus infection is fatal in about 10 percent of the cases, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, but only 50 cases have been reported in the US in the last 10 years, and doctors and hospitals are not required to report the illness to federal authorities. Maine had 3 cases between 1999 and 2001, said Sheila Pinette, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

The virus is commonly passed through bites by woodchuck ticks, which feed on small mammals and rodents. But Charles Lubelczyk, a biologist with Maine Medical Center Research Institute's Vector-borne Disease Laboratory in Scarborough [Maine], said that [this mechanism of transmission is characteristic of only one strain of Powassan virus], and a 2nd strain is passed by deer ticks, which are much more common in Maine and often bite humans. "The problem is it's getting in deer ticks and deer ticks are much more abundant and bite people all the time," he said. The 2nd strain "is something of a game-changer" that could lead to people getting the Powassan virus much more common, he said. "People have to really work to come in contact with woodchuck ticks," while it's fairly common to pick up a deer tick on a walk in the woods, said Dr Erin Staples, a medical epidemiologist with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Researchers have so far detected no difference in the symptoms that develop from the 2 strains, according to Staples. She said the development of a strain carried by deer ticks, combined with a campaign to encourage doctors to test for Powassan, means that reports of the virus are likely to jump in the next few years. Lyme disease, which is also usually passed by deer ticks, can be treated with antibiotics. But since Powassan is a virus, there's no cure and doctors can just hope to control the symptoms. The virus often leads to encephalitis and meningitis.

Lubelczyk said deer ticks are active into the fall, and [the victim] went to an emergency room to get a tick removed from her shoulder on 9 Nov 2013]. She started developing symptoms a day later, her daughter said.

Woodchuck ticks are most active in the summer, Lubelczyk said, and most bites by these [arachnids] occur in June, July, and August, making it unlikely that the artist was bitten by one of those ticks. She developed the typical "bull's-eye" rash common in Lyme disease, which is passed by deer ticks, but [the artist's daughter] said doctors aren't sure if the victim had both Lyme disease and the Powassan virus. Lubelczyk said tests on deer and moose indicate that the virus is present in them throughout much of the state. Although the animals don't actually get sick from the virus, he said, they're part of the transmission chain that goes through ticks to humans. He said state researchers plan to increase their surveillance of ticks next year [2014] to determine if the 2nd strain has spread to more deer ticks, particularly in the midcoast area. Pinette said her office also plans to keep a close eye on the virus and she hopes to make it a requirement that doctors report cases to the state as part of an effort to track the spread of Powassan. She said greater awareness by doctors could also lead many to test for Powassan when they would otherwise assume a patient had contracted Lyme disease.

[Human Powassan (POW) virus infections have been recognized in the United States, Canada, and Russia. In the United States, cases of POW virus disease have been reported primarily from north eastern states and the Great Lakes region. These cases occur primarily in the late spring, early summer, and mid-fall, when ticks are most active.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (http://www.cdc.gov/powassan/): Powassan (POW) virus is transmitted to humans by infected ticks. About 50 cases of POW virus disease were reported in the United States over the past 10 years. Most cases have occurred in the Northeast and Great Lakes region. Signs and symptoms of infection can include fever, headache, vomiting, weakness, confusion, seizures, and memory loss. Long-term neurological problems may occur. There is no specific treatment, but people with severe POW virus illnesses often need to be hospitalized to receive respiratory support, intravenous fluids, or medications.

Reports of Powassan virus infection seem to have been more frequent in the current year (2013), and this report argues that this may perhaps be a consequence of greater prevalence of a strain of the virus adapted to transmission by deer ticks. - Mod.CP
