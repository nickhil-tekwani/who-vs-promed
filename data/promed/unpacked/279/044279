Melioidosis (_Burkholderia pseudomallei_ infection) is rarely imported to
the UK from endemic areas. I am aware of only 9 new cases diagnosed by
culture in England between 1988 and 1997. Four of these patients were
likely to have acquired their infections in the Indian subcontinent, which
suggests that the disease is more common there than is generally believed.
Since the beginning of 1998, another 5 new cases have been diagnosed in
England. Three of these were associated with Bangladesh, and two had only
recently returned from trips there.
Obviously one should not draw conclusions from such small numbers, but I
wonder whether the recent rains and flooding have led to an increase in
cases of melioidosis in Bangladesh and would be interested if anyone has
any further information.
