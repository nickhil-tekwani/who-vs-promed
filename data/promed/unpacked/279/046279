There have been 7 new outbreaks of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza in the country.

According to follow-up report no 2 to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), dated 29 Apr 2015, the veterinary authority in Burkina Faso reports 7 new outbreaks of H5N1 [highly pathogenic avian influenza] on poultry farms, all starting on 19 Apr 2015.

Most of the affected farms were in the provinces of Kadiogo (5) and Poni (1), which have reported previous outbreaks, but Bazega in central Burkina Faso now has its 1st cases.

Of the 18 264 bird affected, 16 009 died and 2255 were slaughtered.
The presence of the H5N1 subtype of the virus has been confirmed.

[Since the start of the current HPAI H5N1 epizootic in Burkina Faso, in early February 2015 (initially reported to the OIE 1 Apr 2015), a total of 18 outbreaks, in 6 provinces, have been reported to the OIE. This includes the 7 new outbreaks covered in follow-up report no. 2, submitted on 30 Apr 2015, and available (with an interactive map) at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=17625.

The epizootic continues it spread in Nigeria and has spread to Niger as well. The virus spreading in the 3 countries is considered to be caused by a novel clade of the A(H5N1) virus, specifically clade 2.3.2.1c, which, according to a recent 'ahead of print' paper (see reference below), most likely entered Nigeria in December 2014. The authors further indicate that the identification of genetic clustering between the strains from Nigeria and the HPAI A(H5N1) viruses originally identified in Asia, suggests an unknown epidemiologic link between these regions, probably associated with human activities, migratory bird movements, or both. They further state that this virus is an intersubtype reassortant which has already caused infection in humans, underlining the urgent need for its complete characterization in terms of virulence and host range.

A map showing all 18 outbreaks in Burkina Faso is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=17455.
