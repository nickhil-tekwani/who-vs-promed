The chief veterinary officer at the Ministry of Agriculture and Food in
Kishinev has reported to the OIE Moldavia's first outbreak of CSF since
March 1996. There are 4,827 susceptible pigs in a fattening station of the
Padish-Chadyr Company, Chadyr-Lunga district in the southeastern section of
the country. The initial fatality rate was high, with only 18 out of 520
pigs surviving in one of the facility's buildings. The situation is now
stable after modified stamping-out, quarantine and control of animal
movement with the country.
The final diagnosis, done by the All-Russian Research Institute, was
classical swine fever triggered by coumarin-initiated immunosuppression of
animals vaccinated against swine fever.

[The only way I can imagine coumarin getting into pigs is through rat
poison, and even whether this mode of immunosuppression is correct
(discussion with my colleagues has failed to reveal confirmation of coumarin
immunosuppression nor was it found in the usual textbooks) coumarin would
have to have been in the feed to cause this high a mortality. - Mod.MHJ]
