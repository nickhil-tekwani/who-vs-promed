With the numbers continuing to climb in the current cyclospora outbreak, with federal health authorities reporting about 284 cases as of this writing, the investigation continues into the source of the outbreak and whether the cases are all related among the several states.

New Jersey joins the outbreak map, becoming the 9th state to report a case to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), according to an update from 24 Jul 2013.

Iowa, Nebraska, Texas, Wisconsin, Georgia, Connecticut, Illinois, and Kansas join the Garden State [New Jersey] in this outbreak. The vast majority of cases are still being reported from the 3 midwestern states of Iowa, Nebraska, and Texas.

Iowa alone accounts for 134 cases, or nearly half. Last Saturday, Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) medical director and state epidemiologist, Dr Patricia Quinlisk said in an interview on Dispatch Radio that the likely source of the outbreak, at least in her state, was fresh vegetables, based on extensive interviews with patients sickened with the parasite.

Concerning prevention of cyclosporiasis, CDC says: "On the basis of the currently available information, avoiding food or water that may have been contaminated with feces is the best way to prevent cyclosporiasis. Treatment with chlorine or iodine is unlikely to kill cyclospora oocysts. No vaccine for cyclosporiasis is available."

Cyclospora sickened about 1000 people in the mid to late 1990s across North America due to contaminated raspberries from Guatemala. Numerous additional outbreaks have been reported since.
