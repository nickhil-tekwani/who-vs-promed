Since the end of January 2018, the State Serum Institute has investigated a disease outbreak of hepatitis caused by hepatitis A virus infections, according to FÃ¸devarestyrelsen (computer translated).

The outbreak thus far includes 14 patients, 7 women and 7 men aged 17-79 years. Patients have become ill from December 2017 onwards. Patients are residents throughout the country and 13 have been hospitalized.

Virus from 7 of the patients has been typed as type 3A, and for the time being, genetic studies have shown that 4 of these are identical, which supports the suspicion of a common source of infection. It is still expected that more patients will come, as about 4 weeks from eating the contaminated dates until you get sick with hepatitis A.

To investigate the source of infection for the outbreak, the State Serum Institute has conducted extensive interviews with the patients and made a case-control study. During the initial interviews, dates, as several of the patients indicated to have eaten, were suspected.

The dates are described by most patients as ones purchased in Rema1000. The dates were recalled on [Tue 6 Feb 2018].
