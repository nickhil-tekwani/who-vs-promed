[ProMED-mail reported on this story in ProMED-mail post 20100716.2373
stating it was Idaho, because the source report was from Idaho. The
body of water in question, Long Lake, is actually in Washington
State. - Mod.TG]

Washington state Ecology and Fish and Wildlife officials say the
recent die-off of hundreds of carp in Long Lake near Spokane may be a
natural occurrence. State health authorities say it's not a human
health emergency.

Ecology experts have ruled out toxic substances as a cause and say
the problem is not low oxygen levels in the 24-mile reservoir on the
Spokane River.

Fish and Wildlife fish biologist Chris Donley says the carp may have
died because of spawning stress and water temperature fluctuations. A
fish pathologist examined a dead carp this week but could not
determine a cause of death. More lab tests are pending.

State officials say the carcasses should decompose in a couple of
weeks. Or they suggest lakeshore homeowners can bury the fish if they
want to get rid of the smell more quickly.

[While the die-off may be a natural occurrence possibly linked to
heat and low oxygen levels in the water, the mess may only have just
started. The rotting carcasses can set up a most unpleasant smell for
residents, but also, those carcasses are the prefect medium for
_Clostridium botulinum_. The flies will move in and lay eggs. Then,
the maggots will hatch and will contain the botulism, which the birds
will eat, and then they will die. The problem will get worse if the
fish are not picked up. - Mod.TG]
