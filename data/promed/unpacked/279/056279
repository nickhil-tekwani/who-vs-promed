Hepatitis A Associated with Consumption of Frozen Strawberries -- Michigan,
March 1997:
In March 1997, a total of 153 cases of hepatitis A were reported in Calhoun
County, Michigan (1990 population: 136,000); 151 case-patients have been
students or staff of schools in four different school districts.
Investigation by public health officials has not implicated a single event,
foodhandler, or contaminated water as a source for the outbreak. However,
most case-patients ate lunch in schools, and preliminary analysis of both a
case-control and cohort study conducted in two different school districts
established a strong association between illness and consumption of food
items containing frozen strawberries. This report presents the preliminary
findings of the ongoing out-break investigation.
The strawberries associated with illness were reportedly from Mexico; a
company in southern California processed, packed, and froze the strawberries
in 30-pound containers for commercial use and then distributed the
strawberries to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)-sponsored school lunch
programs. In addition, multiple packing sizes were distributed to other
commercial customers. Thirteen lots of frozen strawberries, processed on
three dates in April and May 1996 and shipped to Michigan in early December,
were available for use in school lunch programs in Calhoun County during the
potential exposure periods for the case-patients.
The investigation has not determined whether transmission was limited to a
portion of the 13 lots, or the source of the contamination....
Postexposure prophylaxis with immune globulin (IG) should be offered only to
persons who consumed frozen strawberries from the suspected lots through
school lunch programs within 14 days of their exposure. Because of the
limited supply of IG nationwide, these criteria for administration of IG
should be strictly applied. Health-care providers and public health
departments should be alert to any increase in the incidence of hepatitis A
and should investigate cases rapidly.
Hepatitis A cases suspected to be associated with the consumption of frozen
straw-berries should be reported promptly to local or state health
departments, and CDC's Hepatitis Branch, Division of Viral and Rickettsial
Diseases, National Center for Infectious Diseases should be notified

The strawberries in question were served to many students in the Kalamazoo
County schools over the past three months, although it appears that most
were served during February - around Valentine's day. So we believe that
most of those who ate strawberries would have become ill by now, if in fact
the strawberries that were received here were contaminated. There were some
significant problems involved here.
The first was that there was no record keeping as far as we can tell, as to
which schools received which lot, so it is not known which lot(s) were sent
to the schools which experienced disease. All that was known was the lots
which went out at the same time and one or more of those is linked to the
outbreak. So we had a list of 13 lots, any one (or more) may have contained
the contaminated berries. Additionally, for us, and I suspect for many, the
association was made between the strawberries and the outbreak on Easter
weekend, during the spring break for many of the schools. So contacting
first school officials to try and identify if and when the strawberries were
eaten was quite a task, and then getting the message out to parents,
students and staff about the need for immunization. For this we used
primarily the media to get the message out, supplemented with posters in
grocery stores, etc, and also word of mouth. We had just 48 hours after
receiving initial notification of the association to get clinics in place.
