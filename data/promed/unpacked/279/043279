[With the newly confirmed case and 2 newly reported fatalities, the total number of MERS-CoV infected individuals reported by South Korea is now 181 including 31 deaths, for a reported case fatality rate of 17.1 percent. The newly confirmed case is a 4th generation case, having been the physician caring for a 3rd generation case. The period of exposure is the latest period of exposure reported in this outbreak (11-15 Jun 2015), suggesting that breaks in infection control procedures are periodically occurring. We do not know if his contact patient (no. 135) is one of the patients that was in unstable condition and required intubation -- a procedure that carries a high risk of exposure to pulmonary viruses based on experiences with SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome - coronavirus) back in 2002/2003.

The number of reported recoveries is now at 81 (representing 44.8 percent of cases), with 7 newly reported recoveries in the past 24 hours.

Epidemiological investigation of MERS-CoV spread in a single hospital in South Korea, May to June 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: HY Park, EJ Lee, YW Ryu, Y Kim, H Kim, H Lee, SJ Yi
Gyeonggi Infectious Disease Control Center, Seongnam, Gyeonggi, Republic of Korea
Gyeonggi Infectious Disease Control Center Epidemic Intelligence Service, Seongnam, Gyeonggi, Republic of Korea]

In this report, we describe 37 MERS-CoV infection cases (1 primary, 25 secondary, 11 tertiary cases) in a single hospital in South Korea. The median incubation period was 6 days (95 percent CI [confidence interval]: 4-7 days) and the duration between suspected symptom onset and laboratory confirmation was 6.5 days (95 percent CI: 4-9). While incubation period was 2 days longer, the duration from suspected symptom onset to confirmation was shorter in tertiary compared with secondary infections.

Background
----------
The 1st case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in South Korea was reported on 20 May 2015 [1]. As [of] [24 Jun 2015] the outbreak is ongoing, with 179 incident cases across a dozen affected hospitals [2,3]. After developing symptoms on 11 May [2015], the primary case visited several hospitals, and during his admission to Hospital B in Pyeongtaek between [15 and 17 May 2015] [1], 11 other patients, 11 relatives and visitors, and 2 healthcare workers were directly infected [1-11]. Hospital B was closed on 29 May [2015], and since then, the number of new cases has gradually declined. As [of] 24 Jun [2015], 18 days have passed since the last case was laboratory-confirmed in this hospital. As MERS-CoV transmission has not yet ceased fully, data from a single institution able to end the local epidemic may provide some useful information on incubation period and infectious period of the ongoing MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea.

Results of case review
----------------------
The primary case visited 5 hospitals (1 in Chungnam province, 2 in Gyeonggi province, and 2 in Seoul), including Hospital B. A total of 36 patients, later identified as suspected MERS cases, were transferred from Hospital B to 9 hospitals (4 in Gyeonggi province, 2 in Seoul, 2 in Daejeon, and 1 in Jeonbuk province).

The description of each incident case is shown in the Table [Table: Description of incident MERS cases in Hospital B, Pyeongtaek, South Korea, May-June 2015 (n=37), available at http://www.eurosurveillance.org/images/dynamic/EE/V20N25/Yi-tab.png]. There were 37 cases in total, the mean age was 51.7 years (range 24-79), and 21 cases were male. 20 cases were patients admitted to Hospital B, 12 were relatives of patients, 3 were hospital staff who managed the patients, and one was an unrelated visitor. Five of the 6 fatal cases were patients with high-risk underlying comorbidities, and death occurred within 2-23 days after suspected symptom onset; the case fatality rate was calculated as 16.2 percent. 25 patients were infected by the MERS-CoV during the admission of the primary case between 15 to 17 May [2015], and 11 others were classified as tentative tertiary infection, i.e. their exposure to MERS-CoV was not related to the spatiotemporal patterns of the primary case (Figure 1 [Cases of MERS-CoV infection by date, Hospital B, Pyeongtaek, South Korea, May-June 2015 (n=37) available at: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/images/dynamic/EE/V20N25/Yi-fig1.png]).

The incubation period (that is, number of days between last exposure to a MERS case, to date of suspected symptom onset) for the outbreak in Hospital B ranged between 2 to 15 days, with a median of 6 days (95 percent confidence interval (CI): 4-7 days) after the last exposure. When separated by infection order, medians for the incubation period were 4 (95 percent CI: 4-6) and 6 days (95 percent CI: 6-8) for secondary and tertiary infection, respectively (Figure 2*). The number of days between suspected symptom onset and laboratory confirmation for all cases ranged from 0 to 15, with a median of 6.5 days (95 percent CI: 4-9). Upon separation by infection order, medians were 9 (95 percent CI: 8-11) and 4 days (95 percent CI: 3-6) for secondary and tertiary infection, respectively (Figure 3**).

Discussion and conclusion
-------------------------
The district hospital under study is the 1st single institution in South Korea that reported an almost full course of epidemic progress with a transmission chain of MERS-CoV infections from a primary case to tertiary cases over 6 districts. We discovered a prolonged incubation period and shortened symptom-to-laboratory confirmation duration in tertiary infections compared with secondary infections. The prodromal period was defined as the duration between the suspected symptom onset and the peak of fever (greater than 38.5 deg C [101.3 deg F]). As we consider the prodromal period to be longer in tertiary infections, the length of the incubation period may have been overestimated (more than 14 days).

Initially, information on the travel history of the primary case was missing, and since MERS had not been encountered in South Korea before, this medium-scale local hospital was unaware of the MERS-CoV infection in progress until 3 days after the primary case was discharged. Thus isolation and protection measures were delayed; this, in combination with other environmental factors (such as, relative/healthcare worker sleeping in the same room with patients, insufficient air-conditioning, moving of patients to other rooms/wards, etc.) and an unexpected high infectivity of patients with rapidly deteriorating pneumonia, resulted in a high number of secondary and tertiary cases [14].

The shortened duration of symptom-to-laboratory confirmation in tertiary cases may reflect the disease recognition and consecutive earlier testing. However, explanations for a longer incubation period in tertiary infections, compared with secondary infections, require further investigations.

Even though based on small numbers, important implications of our results may apply, predominantly to the current medical delivery system in South Korea. In this system, there are frequent patient transfers between outpatient clinics, outpatient and inpatient general hospital departments, as well as highly specialised hospitals. When healthcare providers are not informed that there have been MERS cases in a hospital from where a patient has been transferred, they will be unable to take adequate measures for infection prevention. This may result in additional transmission. Concurrent delay of contact tracing and isolation may lead to substantial exposure to infection in other medical institutions and even in communities. At the same time, as tertiary infections show longer median incubation period compared with secondary infections (i.e. more time is available before infected cases at tertiary level are distinguished by their symptoms), active identification of contacts and their appropriate management would facilitate earlier infection control, and increase the opportunity for preventing tertiary infections.

Thus, we would like to suggest that any effective prevention measure should include an exhaustive review of information on incident cases, especially on their contacts, at an as early as possible stage. With cumulating experience on MERS cases and their contacts and shorter duration of symptom-to-laboratory confirmation, we hope the end of the ongoing epidemic in South Korea can soon be brought to an end. The MERS-CoV outbreak can be declared ended in South Korea when a 28-day-period (2 incubation periods) has elapsed after the last laboratory-confirmed case.

Preliminary epidemiological assessment of MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea, May to June 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------

South Korea is experiencing the largest outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections outside the Arabian Peninsula. Up to [19 Jun 2015], there have been 166 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 24 deaths, 30 recovered individuals discharged from hospital, and 112 still remaining in hospital [1]. The aim of our study was to conduct a preliminary epidemiological assessment of the MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea in order to further describe and update key epidemiological determinants of MERS-CoV outbreaks.

We estimated that the mean incubation period was 6.7 days and the mean serial interval 12.6 days. We found it unlikely that infectiousness precedes symptom onset. Based on currently available data, we predict an overall case fatality risk of 21 percent (95 percent credible interval: 14-31).

Primary case
------------
The ongoing outbreak in South Korea began when the primary case developed respiratory illness on 11 May [2015] after returning on 4 May [2015] from Bahrain ([18 Apr 2015-2 May 2015]) via Qatar ([2-3 May 2015]). Further epidemiological investigation showed that the primary case had also travelled to the United Arab Emirates ([29-30 Apr 2015]) and Saudi Arabia ([1-2 May 2015]) during their stay in Bahrain [2]. Feeling unwell after returning to South Korea, the primary case visited a local clinic (Hospital A) in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi province on [12, 14, and 15 Apr 2015] and was hospitalised in Hospital B from [15 to 17 Apr 2015]. However, this patient did not initially report their recent travel in the Middle East. Upon discharge from Hospital B, the patient visited another clinic (Hospital C) and was admitted to a general hospital (Hospital D) in Seoul on 17 May [2015], where the patient was later diagnosed with MERS-CoV on 20 May [2015]. Since then, the patient has been isolated and treated in another hospital designated by the Korean government to treat MERS patients.

Statistical analysis

[available at source URL above]

Outbreak description
--------------------
The number of laboratory-confirmed cases increased rapidly until [7 Jun 2015], when 23 cases were confirmed on a single day but appears to have subsided since then (Figure 1A*). Figure 1B* shows the epidemic curve by date of illness onset for 110 cases with available data. It should be recognised that while the outbreak has not yet ended, our preliminary assessment shows that the epidemic to date may have peaked on [1 Jun 2015] when 15 cases reported illness onset. Median age of the 166 cases was 56 years, 101 of 166 (61 percent) were male, and 30 of 166 (18 percent) were healthcare personnel (Table 1**).

Transmission chains
------------------
Figure 2*** shows a summary sketch of the transmission chain (additional material [see Note below] showing the detailed chains is available at http://sph.hku.hk/bcowling/eurosurveillance2015appendix.zip). 119 cases were identified by Korea CDC as having had contact with a confirmed case in the period before their illness onset, and 3 of these cases had contact with more than one confirmed case. A total of 27 secondary cases in a single hospital have been traced back to the primary case (excluding 6 cases with an unclear linkage), and 2 of these, cases 14 and 16, led the 2nd wave of the outbreak by infecting at least 73 and 24 tertiary cases, respectively, following the initial outbreak generated by the primary case in Hospital B (Figure 2). In particular, case 14 infected at least 70 cases between 27 and 29 May [2015] while being treated in the emergency room in Hospital D, one of the 5 largest hospitals located in Seoul with 3980 healthcare professionals and more than 8000 outpatient visits per day [12]. According to the press conference given at Hospital D on [7 Jun 2015], at least 893 patients and visitors were potentially exposed to the virus during this period [13], which explains a significant increase in the number of cases confirmed and notified between [6 and 11 Jun 2015]. Since [12 Jun 2015], when the 1st 4th-generation case was confirmed, 10 more potential 4th-generation cases have been reported. Because of the marked heterogeneity in transmissibility, with the vast majority of cases associated with just these 3 superspreading events in the nosocomial setting, it would be misleading to summarily characterise the transmissibility of the virus in this ongoing outbreak with a single average value of the reproductive number [14]. The mean serial interval was 12 to 13 days in each of 4 epidemiological clusters associated with cases 1, 14, 15, and 16.

Epidemiological parameters
--------------------------
[Full discussion available at source URL above.]

The mean duration of illness onset to laboratory confirmation was 8.1 days for cases with illness onset before [28 May 2015], and substantially shorter (mean: 4.4 days) for cases with illness onset after that date (Figure 3C****).

Presymptomatic infectiousness
-----------------------------
[Full discussion available at source URL above.]

It appeared that a small number of cases might have been infected before their infectors became symptomatic. Furthermore, cases 37 and 39 were epidemiologically linked to multiple confirmed cases.

[... Hence, there was no evidence that infectiousness preceded symptom onset.]

Severity of infections
----------------------
Up to [19 Jun 2015], 24 cases have died while 30 have recovered and been discharged; the other 112 cases remain in hospital and 16 are in critical condition. Among the 24 fatal cases to date, none of which were in healthcare workers, the median age was 68.5 years (range: 49-83 years). We predicted the final CFR to be 21 percent (95 percent CrI [credible interval]: 14-31), allowing for the uncertain outcomes of cases that remained in hospital on the date of analysis.

Comparative epidemiology of MERS and SARS
-----------------------------------------
Table 2***** compares key features of the MERS outbreak in South Korea with the features of MERS epidemiology in previous outbreaks in other countries as well as the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [7,9,11,15-18]. In all MERS outbreaks, current and previous, men were more likely to be cases than women, and the mean age of the cases was around 56 years. There was a marked similarity in the incubation periods and serial intervals and in the case fatality risk.

Discussion
----------
MERS is a relatively new disease, with the 1st confirmed case reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 [2,3]. Globally, a total of 1321 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 466 deaths, have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) to date, of which more than 1000 occurred in Saudi Arabia [2,4]. One of the major challenges in countering the spread of MERS-CoV is the limited understanding of the transmissibility and transmission patterns of the virus, in part because MERS-CoV is a novel pathogen and the experience to date remains mostly confined to cases in Saudi Arabia [4]. However, the outbreak of MERS-CoV in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in 2014 highlighted an increased transmissibility for secondary human-to-human transmission in healthcare settings [5].

Our findings confirm that the epidemiology of MERS in South Korea is similar to that observed in the Middle East [7] and in fact closely resembles that of the 2002-3 outbreak of SARS [17]. The epidemic thus far has undergone 4 generations of infection events (Figure 2) arising from delayed recognition of the primary patient who sought care at multiple healthcare facilities before finally being diagnosed and isolated. The Korean outbreak is remarkable in that 148 of 166 transmission events (89 percent), or 125 of 166 (75 percent) if those who were epidemiologically linked to a cluster but not any infector are excluded, can be attributed to just 3 clusters of nosocomial superspreading events (Figure 2). Importantly, there has not been any evidence of community transmission thus far.

Given that (i) there is no known zoonotic reservoir of MERS-CoV in South Korea, (ii) the probability of further foreign importation of infected cases appears to be low because very few MERS cases have been identified outside of the Middle East to date and (iii) infectiousness is unlikely to precede symptom onset, the key to controlling the present epidemic remains prompt recognition and isolation of further cases through rigorous contact tracing and close medical surveillance of those quarantined. This also applies to other outbreaks of MERS that may occur in the future. We estimated that the incubation period had a 95th percentile of 12.1 days, which supports the quarantine period of 2 weeks currently recommended by public health authorities.

Previous studies based on several outbreaks in the Arabian Peninsula estimated the basic reproductive number (R0) to be between 0.6 and 0.8 overall [6,7,19,20], although with apparent heterogeneity leading to sporadic outbreaks in which R0 exceeded 1 [21]. In our analysis described here we felt that it would not be appropriate to estimate an average reproductive number because of the heterogeneity in transmissibility associated with the 3 superspreading events. However, it is clear that apart from those 3 events, the MERS-CoV had low transmissibility in this outbreak.

The CFR of 21 percent (95 percent CrI: 14-31) estimated here is substantially lower than the overall CFR in a previous analysis of cases most of whom were from the Middle East (444/1,163; 38 percent) [2], but the same as the CFR reported by Cauchemez et al for secondary cases excluding sporadic cases identified after presenting with serious disease (21 percent) [7], and very similar to the CFR of SARS in Hong Kong in 2003 (Table 2*****) [17]. While our estimate of the CFR accounts for uncertainty in the final outcomes of patients that remain in hospital, it is challenging to have accurate estimates of the CFR early in the course of an outbreak [10,22]. If the CFR in this outbreak remained below 25 percent once the final outcome for all cases has been ascertained, it would indicate a lower severity of MERS-CoV than in some previous and contemporary reports. A lower CFR would be consistent with the much lower severity observed among secondary cases in the Middle East that were identified through contact tracing, presumably owing to a combination of earlier supportive treatment and/or a lower infective dose and/or lower clinical severity due to other host factors [23]. Greater severity in the sporadic cases could be an artifact of surveillance biased towards infections associated with serious illnesses. Consistent with previous reports, older age was associated with greater risk of severe disease [15,24,25]. We did not have data on underlying medical conditions, but it is known from other outbreaks of MERS that a history of chronic disease is another risk factor for disease progression and mortality [11,15,25,26].

Our epidemiological characterisation relied on the assumption that the transmission network as ascertained by the MoH was accurate. Specifically, the network essentially comprised secondary cases of 3 superspreading events (namely infections caused by case 1, 14 and 16). The serial interval and incubation period of the secondary cases generated by these 3 superspreading events were similar, which supports the validity of the network ascertained by the MoH. Nonetheless, infected people with apparently longer incubation periods in the data might have been tertiary instead of secondary cases, in which case we would have overestimated the incubation period. On the other hand, because the outbreak in South Korea is still ongoing and driven by superspreading events, cases with very long incubation periods and/or long serial intervals may not have been identified yet and we may have underestimated the incubation period and serial interval distributions.

This outbreak demonstrates the potential for clusters of emerging infectious diseases to have very substantial societal and economic impact. In South Korea with a population of 50 million, 166 cases of MERS caused major reductions in tourism, nationwide school closures, and some preliminary forecasts for a growth in annual gross domestic product reduced by at least 0.1 percent [27]. As this outbreak appears to be coming to an end, focus of public health authorities may shift from the immediate control efforts towards a detailed investigation of the mechanisms and causes that led to the superspreading events. The parallels with superspreading events driving the spread of SARS in 2003 in Hong Kong and Singapore emphasise the importance of understanding these events and of determining the measures that could be taken to reduce the risk of similar incidents happening in the future.

[Again, an impressive set of analyses on the ongoing (and hopefully winding down) outbreak in South Korea. Our collective thanks to the South Koreans and Eurosurveillance for making this available to us so rapidly. It is interesting to see the comparison between the South Korean outbreak and the SARS outbreak from 2002-2003 -- suggesting (not surprisingly) that these 2 different coronaviruses seem to be behaving in very similar epidemiologic patterns, with the superspreading events being key events for rapid outbreaks.

I highly recommend reading the original article at the source URL and looking at the figures and tables. Figure 2 is an impressive representation of the 3 superspreading events, showing how they were responsible for the overwhelming majority of cases reported as of the date of these analyses. For a more in-depth statistical analysis of the superspreading events, I highly recommend reading Kucharski AJ, Althaus CL: The role of superspreading in Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) transmission. Euro Surveill. 2015; 20(25): pii=21167; available at http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=21167. The authors mention they found ".....substantial potential for superspreading; even though it is likely that R0 is less than 1 overall, our analysis indicates that cluster sizes of over 150 cases are not unexpected for MERS-CoV infection."

The discussion suggesting the variance in case fatality rates observed in South Korea versus those seen in the Middle East -- "Greater severity in the sporadic cases could be an artifact of surveillance biased towards infections associated with serious illnesses," is something we have mentioned before. - Mod.MPP]

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Republic of Korea 23 Jun 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Between [20 and 23 Jun 2015], the National IHR Focal Point of the Republic of Korea notified WHO of 9 additional confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) alongside 3 additional deaths.

Additional information on the outbreak in Korea
-----------------------------------------------
To date, a total of 175 MERS-CoV cases, including 27 deaths, have been reported. One of the 175 cases is the case that was confirmed in China and also notified by the National IHR Focal Point of China.

The median age of the cases is 56 years old (ranging from 16 to 87 years old). The majority of cases are men (60 percent). 23 cases (13 percent) are health care professionals. To date, all cases (excluding the index case) have been linked to a single chain of transmission and are associated with health care facilities.

Detailed information concerning MERS-CoV cases in the Republic of Korea can be found in a separate document (see related links [available at source URL above]).

Public health response
----------------------
The government of the Republic of Korea continues to implement intense case and contact management activities. As of [23 Jun 2015], 2805 contacts are being monitored while a total of 10 718 contacts have been released. The downward trend of reported MERS-CoV cases seems to indicate that the containment measures put in place by the national health authorities of Korea are beginning to work.

Global situation
----------------
Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1348 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 479 related deaths.

[At the bottom of the page is the following statement: "Disease Outbreak News concerning MERS-CoV in the Republic of Korea will be published on a bi-weekly basis (on Tuesdays and Fridays). Due to the magnitude of the current outbreak, DONs will focus on describing the evolution of the outbreak and epidemiological trends, instead of focusing on individual case details." -- this update appeared on the WHO website after Tuesday this week. - Mod.MPP]
