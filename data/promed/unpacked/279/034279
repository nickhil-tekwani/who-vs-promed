Horses to be examined for equine infectious anaemia
---------------------------------------------------
Horses in North Rhine-Westphalia [NRW] and Rhineland-Palatinate have been found, during August 2012, infected by equine infectious anaemia (EIA) (see 20120821.1255129). The source of infection was a horse from a clinic kept as a blood donor. All horses in direct contact with the blood donor were investigated immediately -- approximately 600 animals, which all tested negative for EIA so far.

As infection can go undetected for a long time, the authorities have now decided to examine all horses that had contact in any way with the donor horse during the period from September 2009 to June 2012. This extensive investigation affects 2039 horses. This effort is necessary, on the one hand to find the possible source of infection in the clinic horse, and on the other hand to exclude the possibility that horses got infected at the veterinary hospital.

The majority of the 2039 horses are from NRW and Rhineland-Palatinate. Other horses are from other (German) Lander [states] as well as from EU Member States (e.g., Belgium and the Netherlands). 9 more horses from 3rd countries (Switzerland, Russia, USA, Saudi Arabia, Qatar) are affected.

Horse owners in NRW are asked for support and cooperation, as the investigation is the only way to protect the equine population.

The local veterinary authorities in the counties and cities have received lists with names of the affected horse owners. They will contact the owners to have blood sampled from their horses. The samples will be tested in NRW by the Chemical and Veterinary Research Office-Emscher-Lippe (CVUA Munster) for antibodies to the virus.

Infectious anaemia (of equines) is a notifiable disease. If confirmed, compulsory control measures are introduced and the source of infection has to be identified.

This viral disease is transmitted primarily through blood transmission -- horseflies or other biting insects can acquire the virus during blood feeding and then infect other animals. The transfer of the virus from one horse to another is rarely observed in Germany. The infection is usually passed in pasture because horse flies do not fly into buildings or stables and flies are usually controlled inside the buildings.

Usually no clinical disease is obvious immediately after infection, which occurs slowly without visible signs. Therefore, a horse can carry the infection for several years without being noticed. In particular stress (e.g., other diseases, re-housing, changes of ownership, work pressure) leads to virus replication and to the 1st signs of clinical disease, mainly fatigue, apathy, loss of appetite and eventually the onset of anaemia. Fever, marked anaemia and edema on the abdomen and legs will only be experienced in the advanced stages of infection.

[EIA is caused by a lentivirus (_Retroviridae_). Though not a zoonosis, its epidemiology resembles HIV in humans and this has enhanced research into the disease. Since the pathogen has not been shown to multiply in insects, infected equids appear to be the only reservoir of the virus. Iatrogenic transmission via hypodermic needles and tattoo equipment is well-known. Infection by the injection of blood plasma, as described above, should not surprise and deserves the attention and precaution of equine practitioners.
