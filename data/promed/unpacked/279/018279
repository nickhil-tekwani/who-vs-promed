At the request of the Fiji Ministry of Health, we are submitting to PACNET
this report of a case of cholera, for the information of PACNET readers.

Cholera in Fiji
Submitted by the Fiji Ministry of Health, P.O. Box 2223, Suva, Fiji
Dr. Asinate Boladuadua
On 30 July 1999, the New Zealand Ministry of Health reported an imported
case of cholera to WHO and to the Fiji Ministry of Health. _Vibrio
cholerae_ O1 El Tor subtype Ogawa had been confirmed in a 26 year old New
Zealand male who had visited a small off-shore reef island in Fiji as a
tourist in June 1999. He had experienced onset of symptoms on day four of
his visit. A similar New Zealand case, possibly acquired at the same Fiji
island resort, was investigated by the Fiji Ministry of Health eight months
earlier. No other cases were found at that time.
Following the latter report, the Fiji Ministry of Health launched a
thorough investigation, in collaboration with WHO. No further cholera cases
have been detected, but the investigators did find evidence of faecal
contamination of the island's fresh water source (i.e., the groundwater
lens) and of the salt water intake for a desalination facility purchased by
the resort a few years earlier. Water samples from boreholes that draw from
the groundwater lens have revealed the presence of _Vibrio
parahaemolyticus_, _V. mimicus_ O36, and _V. cholerae_ O19. _Vibrio
cholerae_ O1 has not been found in the water samples taken.
The island's drinking water is separately obtained from a rainwater
catchment system, supplemented by barged water from outside the island, and
supplied to guest rooms in plastic jugs. All water sources (borehole,
desalinator, rain catchment, and barged water) are chlorinated before
distribution. Although the borehole and desalinated water is not intended
for drinking, investigators considered it likely that the infections had
occurred either by consumption of foods contaminated in the kitchen with
inadequately treated borehole water, or by inadvertent consumption of the
water itself when free residual chlorine was absent.
Revised chlorination procedures are currently in place to provide added
protection in the short term for residents and visitors, and warning signs
have been posted in the rooms. Other measures are underway to provide a
long-term solution on the affected island. There is no evidence to suggest
that a problem exists in Fiji beyond this small resort island, and Fiji's
water supply is generally considered safe.
