A group of farmers said that due to a mysterious disease most of the
fruit orchards, especially the plum and peaches, in Bagh Banan, Ormar
and different districts of Malakand Division [Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa
(formerly North-West Frontier) Province] had suffered huge financial
loss but the government has yet to conduct research to control the
disease.

Fruit orchards in district Peshawar [Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (formerly
North-West Frontier) Province] have been hit by a mysterious disease
leaving the plants dry, inflicting heavy financial losses on the
farmers of the area. The disease had particularly hit plum and peach
orchards. Farmers said that the matter has been brought to the notice
of the department of agriculture, but no official has been to the area
so far.

[It is not clear whether the 2 items report different problems,
whether there is confusion about the location, or whether this is a
large scale outbreak. Both plum and peach belong to genus _Prunus_
(stone fruit) and have most pathogens in common.

Leaf curl, which has been reported in 2009 from the region
(ProMED-mail post 20090518.1860), is unlikely to lead to such severe
symptoms but can make affected trees more vulnerable to other
pathogens. In 2007, _Plum pox virus_ was reported in northern Pakistan
(ProMED-mail post 20070903.2893), which can lead to shoot dieback, but
a range of other pathogens may also cause symptoms that can be
described as "drying" of trees.
