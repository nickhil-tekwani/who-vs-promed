RESPIRATORY ILLNESS - NEPAL (DOLAKHA) (02)

The symptoms, although scant in presentation, do make it sound like the
illness could be chemical in nature. If it were leishmaniasis, Japanese
encephalitis, Nipah, SARS, or Avian influenza, etc., the numbers of cases
would be much lower in the same time frame, and the spread would be much
further.
I think that the symptom of giddiness would suggest aerosol chemical
intoxication. It would be interesting to note what businesses are upwind
of the illness outbreak area.

[The number and ages of people involved are rather suggestive of an
aerosolized chemical. The clinical signs/symptoms make one think of BZ, the
abbreviation given to 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate. It is considered to be an
incapacitating agent and has some properties similar to LSD. BZ and
aerosolized LSD result in lethargy, giddiness, and fever; it is their
protein content that produces the fever. Things like phosgene, chlorine,
cyanide, etc., almost never produce a fever.
There may also be tachycardia and elevated blood pressure. The patients may
prefer a cooler environment, and physostigmine treatment may need to be
repeated over several days as well as diazepam, should the patient
experience seizures.
The article does not mention mydriasis or blurred vision or whether the
patient is dry and flushed or has cold sweating extremities. With the
signs/symptoms listed in the article, BZ may be a logical possibility, and
if so, then over the next day or 2 signs/symptoms will resolve. - Mod.TG]
