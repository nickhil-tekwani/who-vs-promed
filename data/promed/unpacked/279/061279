Schistosmiasis outbreak in safari camp
--------------------------
GeoSentinel, the global surveillance program of the International
Society of Travel Medicine, wishes to report on an ongoing
significant point source outbreak of acute travel-related
schistosomiasis apparently localized to an artificial swimming pond
at a small tented camp hotel near to Lake Eyasi, Tanzania.
As the small man-made pool seems heavily contaminated, there may be
still undiagnosed returned travelers out there worldwide either with
non-specific illnesses of unknown origin or without symptoms. Once
diagnosed a simple course of praziquantel will cure most infections.

From Eli Schwartz, MD (ISR Geosentinel Site):
28 Israelis in 2 separate groups went on a safari trip to Tanzania.
They spent 1 day (in April 2007) at the Kisima Ngeda tented lodge
near Lake Eyasi which itself is salt water (schistosomiais is not
possible in salt water). The freshwater pond at the hotel has
vegetation and according to the ill travelers also snails. Except for
3 people, everyone swam in the pond for 0.5-1 hour only once. No one
had other freshwater exposure during the trip and none had previous
travel to Africa except for 2 Israeli guides.
The first case came to our emergency room about 4 weeks after return
with several days of fever, urticaria, and later cough and
eosinophilia was documented. A clinical diagnosis of acute
schistosomiasis was made and the rest of the group was investigated.
23/25 people who swam in the pool are infected by serology. Serology
was confirmed by the US CDC, and western blot shows S. mansoni mostly
but also 2 patients are positive for both S. mansoni and S. hematobium.
17/23 (74 percent) are symptomatic. According to the 2 guides (who
both were severely ill), they had several previous visits to the
hotel over a number of years with no problems. There is another
family of 6 people who visited the hotel 1 week earlier, 3 of whom
are similarly ill who are currently under investigation.

Prof. Dr. Frank von Sonnenburg (MUC GeoSentinel Site at the
University of Munich) reports:
A journalist was seen in Munich in March 2007 after a 2 month Africa
trip. She had a high fever at one point during travel which was
treated with routine antibiotics after a negative malaria smear. When
she presented to us she was clinically healthy but had an
eosinophilia of 17 percent and many eggs of Schistosoma mansoni on
rectal scrapings. She recalls no other fresh water exposure during
the trip except at the pool at the Kisima Ngeda camp. We are
presently investigating exposure histories in several of the
abnormally large number of German travelers to Tanzania presenting in
Munich in the past few weeks.
A review of the hotel website indicates that the camp is located on a
former farm and that the toilets drain into some sort of septic
system. One wonders if there is a flaw in the design of the drainage system.
The lesson is likely that there is really no safe fresh water in
Africa and that the advice of most travel medicine advisors to avoid
any fresh water exposure in Africa is sound. It is hard to track
acute changes in some environmental factor, perhaps in this case, a
new drainage pattern for fecal waste. The safari camp has been
contacted and we understand they have now ceased all bathing activity
in the artificial pool.
GeoSentinel advises clinicians to consider schistosomiasis in ill
travelers from Tanzania especially those with an eosinophilia. Any
traveler with exposure that may be linked to this focal outbreak
should be screened with serology for schistosomiasis even if
clinically well and with no abnormalities in other blood tests.
GeoSentinel would appreciate hearing of further suspected cases so as
to be able to prepare comprehensive documentation for formal publication.

[Outbreaks of schistosomiasis in tourists exposed to the same
infected water source have been reported before (see, for instance:
Fuller et al. Schistosomiasis in Omo National Park of southwest
Ethiopia. Am J Trop Med Hyg 1979;28:526-30; Harries et al.
Schistosomiasis in expatriates returning to Britain from the tropics:
a controlled study. Lancet 1986;i:86-8; Schwartz E et al. Schistosome
infection among river rafters on Omo River, Ethiopia. J Travel Med
2005;12:3-8; Meltzer E et al. Schistosomiasis among travelers: new
aspects of an old disease. Emerg Infect Dis 2006;12:1696-700).
Most infections will be asymptomatic, but can be found by detecting
Schistosoma-specific antibodies supported in some cases by
eosinophilia and an elevated total IgE level. Specific antibodies may
take some months to develop, which mean that antibody tests performed
a few weeks after return should if negative be repeated after at
least 2 months. - Mod.EP]
