A Comment
---------
I have just seen the ProMED-mail post on this subject [see ref. below] and I
wish to make the following comment.
It is true that cellular blood prod
ucts (i.e., red cells and platelets) still can infect recipients if the blood
donor donates shortly after infection, before antibodies are present. That is
why certain countries have introduced PCR [testing] for hepatitis C virus,
and possibly human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Even with PCR, protection
cannot be 100 percent [certain] [1]. Pathogen inactivation of cellular blood
products is under development. Products used for pathogen inactivation
interfere with nucleic acids of the pathogen and might also interfere with
nucleic acids in the blood recipient, thus possibly becoming mutagenic and
carcinogenic. As residual infectivity of cellular blood products in developed
countries is very low, the net benefit of pathogen-inactivated blood products
is difficult to prove.
It is highly unlikely that 6400 blood donors in Japan donated whole blood
during the early phase of infection. It is more likely that the plasma of
some infectious donations entered a plasma pool from which 6400 plasma
derivatives (e.g., albumin, coagulation factors, and immunoglobulins) were
produced [or that plasma from 6400 donors was pooled to produce those
derivatives. - Mod.JW]. Production processes of plasma derivatives normally
contain highly efficacious virus inactivation procedures. I am not aware of
break-through infections of hepatitis C virus or HIV through virus-
inactivated plasma derivatives during the last 8 years, and I would be very
interested to learn further details.
