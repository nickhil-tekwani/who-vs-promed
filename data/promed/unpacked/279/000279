Farmers in Sirajganj district [Rajshahi division] are worried of getting poor yield of [rice] crops due to blast attack, according to the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE). Some 20 000 hectares [about 49 420 acres] have been affected by the disease in the last 3 days.

DAE cancelled the leave of all staff in affected [areas] for bringing the situation under control as well as to protect the paddy fields from the attack.

DAE said farmers did not put fertiliser in a proper way. Besides, the hot temperature in daylight and fall of the same at night has pushed up the epidemic. [They] advised the farmers to spray medicines.

[Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Pyricularia oryzae_ (previously _Magnaporthe oryzae_). It is one of the most destructive diseases of the crop worldwide, with potential yield losses of more than 50 per cent. Symptoms include lesions on all parts of the shoot, as well as stem rot and panicle blight. When nodes are infected, all plant parts above the infection die and yield losses are severe. When infection occurs at the seedling or tillering stages, plants are often completely killed; infection late in the growth cycle generally leads to less severe damage. Depending on which plant parts are affected, the disease may manifest itself as leaf, collar, node, or neck blast. More than 50 species of grasses and sedges can be affected by related pathogens, but most strains isolated from rice can only infect a limited number of cultivars.

The fungus also causes wheat blast (for example, see ProMED-mail posts 20170306.4883233 and 20170123.4784298). Although the pathogens are currently classified as the same species, the wheat blast pathogen is a distinct population (referred to as _P. oryzae_ Triticum population) and does not cause disease in rice.

Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by climatic conditions, including high humidity. The disease is also favoured by high nitrogen levels (for example from fertilizers, as mentioned above). The fungus is spread by infected plant debris, mechanical means (including insect activity), water and wind. Disease management may include fungicides and cultural practices but relies mainly on resistant varieties. However, the fungus is highly variable and this favours the emergence of new strains with increased virulence. Use of certified clean seed is essential, and farm saved seed poses a high risk of carry-over of the fungus to subsequent crops.
