An elk found dead on a Swift Current, Sask., ranch this winter was infected
with chronic wasting disease (CWD).
George Luterbach, animal health program manager at the Canadian Food
Inspection Agency in Winnipeg, said the cause of death was confirmed March
10.
The remaining 64 elk in the herd have been under quarantine since the
death. None are displaying symptoms of the disease.
CWD is a progressive fatal disease of the nervous system of cervids,
including elk, mule deer and white-tailed deer. It is a transmissible
spongiform encephalopathy (TSE), as are scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in
humans. The cause is unknown and there is no live animal test, treatment or
vaccine.
Luterbach said the animal died at the same ranch where another elk died [of
CWD in 1998. At that time, several others identified as high-risk were
destroyed. He said the most recent death was not a relative of the first
infected animal, but was a herd mate.
"It does raise the possibility there had been disease transmission from the
particular farm," he said. "There is no known risk to humans, although
there are other diseases that are, and from that perspective we are taking
a cautious approach."
No animals have been sold from the farm, but animals have been purchased
and brought there. "That of course is part of the investigation," Luterbach
said.
This brings to 3 the number of cases found in Saskatchewan elk herds. The
first animal died near Sedley in 1996 and the entire herd was destroyed.
The animal had been imported from the United States and lived in Canada for
7 years. In the 1998 case, the mother of the infected animal had come from
the U.S. Lloyd Spencer, past-president of the Saskatchewan Elk Breeders
Association, said elk producers are confident the inspection agency is
properly handling the situation. He said producers are concerned, but noted
3 cases out of more than 20 000 elk in the province is an extremely low
number.
"Canada probably has a reputation of being the most health conscious and
reliable supplier of food in the world," Spencer said. "There is no place
where we take more drastic measures to eradicate disease. It will be dealt
with appropriately."
