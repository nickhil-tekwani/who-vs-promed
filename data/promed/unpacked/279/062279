[MERS in animals is not included in OIE list of reportable diseases. Following the initial information on human infection with a new corona virus coined as MERS-CoV ("Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus"), and suspected animal origin of the human infections, OIE published in July 2013 a press release (Q&A) in which the following was included:
- "If information from public health investigations identifies a possible animal source, OIE will support further joint investigations.
- "OIE member countries would be obliged to report a confirmed case of MERS-CoV in animals to OIE as an emerging disease in accordance with article 1.1.3 of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code. If MERS-CoV was identified in an animal, this would not necessarily mean that the animal is a source of human infection. Detailed investigations would then be needed to understand the relationship between any animal cases and human cases, and whether a finding in animals would be significant for human infection".

Following the said OIE announcement, Qatar became the 1st member-country which submitted to the OIE, in Nov 2013, an "Immediate notification" report on MERS infection in camelidae (20131129.2082115). This was followed by Oman (May 2014), Iran (Oct 2014), Saudi Arabia (Feb 2016) and Jordan (Aug 2016).

The summarized data which the OIE received from Saudi Arabia since the start of the reporting in late January 2016, is the following:
Total outbreaks: 17 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Camelidae / 757 / 111 / 0 / 0 / 0
(details of all 8 reports and a map of the 17 'outbreaks', at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000028831_20181203_163932.pdf.

The above follow-up report states that the described outbreak had "no zoonotic impact", which means that no related human health issue was observed. It may thus be assumed that:
1. Clinical signs were seen in the dromedaries herd involved, or
2. The animals (which age?) did not show suspected clinical signs of MERS but were sampled due to a different reason, such as tests required for export purposes, or applied within an active surveillance. - Mod.AS]
