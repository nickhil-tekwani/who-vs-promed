A recent case of paralytic shellfish poisoning [PSP] is being investigated on Gravina Island [near Ketchikan]. A woman was hospitalized for suspected PSP on 28 May 2013, after consuming cockles and clams harvested on the island. Symptoms within a few minutes of eating included numbness in the lips, followed by tingling in the fingers and toes, and increasing numbness from her feet to her knees. The patient has since been released from the hospital.

Lab results from the shellfish returned with incredibly high toxin levels. A mixture of the leftover clams and cockles returned a test result of 3409 microg/100 g (3409 parts per million/per 100 grams of weight). A 2nd sample was tested at 3148 microg/100 g. These are some of the highest saxitoxin levels ever recorded in Alaska shellfish. Anything above 80 microg/100 g is considered toxic.

The Alaska Department of Health reminds the public that shellfish poisoning, or PSP, is an ever-present danger in locally harvested shellfish, including clams, mussels, cockles, and oysters. PSP can cause a tingling sensation in your lips and fingertips, followed by numbing of your arms and legs, and in some cases can lead to death. Anyone experiencing these symptoms should seek immediate medical care. Remember, PSP cannot be cooked or cleaned out of shellfish, but commercially grown shellfish is tested and considered safe.

[Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) (http://aquaticpath.umd.edu/toxalg/psp.html) is a significant problem on both the east and west coasts of the USA. Caused by several closely related species in the genus _Alexandrium_, PSP toxins are responsible for persistent problems due to their accumulation in filter feeding shellfish, but they also move through the food chain, affecting zooplankton, fish larvae, adult fish, and even birds and marine mammals. On the east coast, PSP is a serious and recurrent problem from Maine to Massachusetts. Connecticut, Long Island (New York), and New Jersey occasionally experience the toxin at low levels, but these areas seem to define the southern extreme of this organism's geographic distribution. On the west coast, PSP is a recurrent annual problem along the coasts of northern California, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska. Overall, PSP affects more coastline than any other harmful algal bloom problem.

It is likely that seasonally recurring outbreaks of PSP are linked to the existence of a dormant cyst stage in the _Alexandrium_ life history. This strategy allows the species to deposit dormant cells in sediments where they survive through harsh winter conditions and then germinate to initiate new outbreaks in subsequent years. Prior to 1972, for example, PSP was restricted to the far eastern sections of Maine ("down east") near the Canadian border. That year, however, a massive red tide causing high levels of toxicity in those areas for the 1st time recorded in history. Virtually every year since that event, this region has experienced PSP outbreaks, a result of the successful colonization of the area by _Alexandrium_ spp. A similar expansion, with subsequent recurring outbreaks of _Alexandrium_, occurred in the Puget Sound region of Washington in the late 1970s an area with no prior history of shellfish poisoning. Long-term climatic variability, which affects temperature, upwelling, and currents or allows cysts to survive in areas where they did not before, may be factors in such range extensions.

Shellfish that have caused this disease include mussels, cockles, clams, scallops, oysters, crabs, and lobsters. Symptoms begin anywhere from 15 minutes to 10 hours after eating the contaminated shellfish, although usually within 2 hours. Symptoms are generally mild, and begin with numbness or tingling of the face, arms, and legs. This is followed by headache, dizziness, nausea, and muscular incoordination. Patients sometimes describe a floating sensation. In cases of severe poisoning, muscle paralysis and respiratory failure occur, and in these cases death may occur in 2 to 25 hours.
