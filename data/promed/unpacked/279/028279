The British Columbia [BC] government is sending an inspector to a Vancouver Island fish processing plant after video emerged showing bloody discharge being dumped into seawater near Campbell River.

Videographer Tavish Campbell captured blood and fish parts from the plant being released directly into the water in November [2019]. He also collected samples, which were tested by the Atlantic Veterinary College and came back positive for piscine orthoreovirus (PRV).

"It's devastating," Campbell said in an interview with CTV News. "Part of me is disappointed, part of me is angry, but mainly I'm just scared for our wild salmon."

The highly contagious virus is found in farmed salmon, like those at the Brown's Bay plant where Campbell filmed, and isn't considered harmful to humans. Some scientists say the virus hurts wild salmon, while others say the strain found in BC presents a low risk to the fish.

Two years ago, Campbell raised the same issue. While the federal government oversees aquaculture, BC hands out permits and regulates what can be discharged.

An emailed statement from the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change states: "The ministry is sending an inspector to the site next week [8-14 Dec 2019] to ensure compliance as we take the matter of a healthy aquatic environment for wild salmon and other aquatic life very seriously."

The statement went on to say while PRV may be detected, testing doesn't show if it is active. It also notes changes have been introduced to include "stronger controls including the requirement to treat the discharge so that pathogens, such as PRV, don't have a negative impact on the environment."

It's unclear how that can be regulated if tests can't say if PRV is viable or not.

The company in the video, Brown's Bay Packing, commissioned a CAD 1.5 million [about USD 1.14 million] water treatment system after the province strengthened controls around what can be dumped in the water.

Campbell says he's looking for action from the federal government. "There certainly is a solution to this, and that solution is to transition these open-net pens salmon farms onto land."

The Liberals promised to make that transition happen by 2025 during the federal election campaign. Scientists from Ottawa continue to study PRV and its impact on fish.

"Salmon are linked to everything that I love about this coast," Campbell said.

[The 1st cases of heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI), were registered in 1999 in the Hitra/Freya area of Norway. Since then, there has been an increasing number of outbreaks along the Norwegian coast, and it was also reported in the UK and in Chile (see archive no. 20111013.3068). Later on, the piscine reovirus (PRV) was established as the causative agent. PRV has been common among wild and farmed salmonids in British Columbia, western Canada, since 1987. A study conducted in that region (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfd.12285/full) documented presence of infected fish without heart lesions, which supports the hypothesis that fish can have high levels of PRV without HSMI, consistent with the high incidence of PRV in some wild Atlantic salmon in Norway with few heart lesions. Further studies are needed to evaluate the significance of this virus in local wild fish populations. - Mod.PMB
