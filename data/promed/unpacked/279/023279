By the way are sure it is JE you are dealing with in the first place?

[A. I do not know this person or his/her name but s/he has access to a
Malaysian Government e-mail address, so I guess it is legitimate.
B. All we know about the JE outbreak in India is the press report we
received from Dr. Markon.
C. E-mail is a difficult medium and I cannot fathom whether the question
asked by Azahar is a serious one or one sent tongue-in-cheek.
D. In either event, it is a legitimate question. When ProMED-mail receives
reports about this or that infectious disease episode it is rare that
anyone sends laboratory test results as well. All we receive are summaries
such as "There have been 67 cases of X disease". Unless, as Hamlet said of
Polonius "You shall nose him as you go upstairs to the lobby", we sense
something odd or note the illogic in a report (Nipah virus purported to be
JE in Malaysia, West Nile virus purported to be St. Louis encephalitis in
New York, 10 000 sheep dying of bluetongue in three months in south India,
etc.), all we can do is report what we hear/read.
E. Finally, does anyone have definitive information as to the exact
diagnosis of the cases being reported as JE in India? That is, has there
been laboratory confirmation or have all the diagnoses been made on
clinical grounds? - Mod.CHC
