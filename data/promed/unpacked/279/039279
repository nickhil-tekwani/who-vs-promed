Emergency measures are being implemented to halt a measles outbreak.
Health chiefs in London have ordered NHS [National Health Service]
trusts to offer MMR [mumps, measles and rubella] jabs in quick
succession amid a surge in measles. There have been over 200 cases in
southeast London in the 1st 5 months of this year [2008]. It comes
after a record 1000 were recorded nationally in 2007.

The Health Protection Agency said it hoped that offering the 2 jabs
within months instead of 2 years apart would help stem the rise.
Similar steps were taken when there was a high concentration of cases
in north London last year [2007].

Measles [virus] is a highly infectious virus. It starts with a fever
and conjunctivitis before a rash develops. The rash often lasts about
a week, and other complications can include pneumonia and diarrhea.
The MMR jab is used to immunise children against the disease. Before
the triple vaccine was introduced in the late 1980s, there were 20
deaths a year on average in the UK. But since the early 1990s, there
has just been one in total.

It is not known exactly what has caused the rise in cases, but
take-up of MMR [vaccine] has struggled to recover from being linked
to autism in the 1990s. At least 95 percent of children need to have
the triple-jab to create herd immunity to stop the disease spreading,
but London in particular has struggled to reach that. About 3/4th of
children across London have had the 1st jab, which is given to babies
at 13 months of age. The 2nd jab, offered to capture the one in 10
who do not get immunity by the 1st vaccination, is normally given
before children start school.

But the Health Protection Agency has told the 6 trusts in southeast
London -- Lewisham, Lambeth, Southwark, Bexley, Bromley and Greenwich
-- to give the 2nd jab one to 3 months after the 1st.

HPA disease control expert Diana McInnes said: "The increase in
measles cases is of concern, and we know that large numbers of
children are still not fully protected. In southeast London, we are
encouraging parents to give [permission for] the 2nd MMR [to be
administered] between one to 3 months after the 1st dose to protect
their children. Children's immune systems have a huge capacity, and
overloading them with the vaccination is not an issue. Our main focus
is to remind people that they need 2 doses of the MMR vaccine to be
fully protected."

Health officials in Lewisham, which has had some of the highest rates
of infection, are running special clinics to get every child under 5
immunised. Parents of children between 5 and 16 who have not had the
2nd jab are also being urged to go to their GP to get the jab. A
Lewisham PCT spokesman warned: "The disease is still spreading,
particularly among school-age children."

It remains to be seen whether voluntary exhortation will be
sufficient to contain the increase in measles in the districts of
South London where vaccine uptake is low. - Mod.CP]
