Workers exposed to anthrax; Live samples sent to Children's Hospital
Oakland by mistake
-----------------------------------------------
At least 6 researchers working on an anthrax vaccine at Children's
Hospital Oakland Research Institute were exposed to the dangerous
live agent, possibly due to a shipping mix-up, officials said
Thursday. The workers -- including a lead researcher, 2 lab
technicians and an animal handler -- handled the live anthrax
bacterium. Several other researchers were also present. None has
shown signs of illness, and 7 are now on the antibiotic Cipro as a
precautionary measure. The incident poses no risk to any other staff,
the surrounding community or Children's Hospital, which is about one
mile from the research facility, state health officials said.
"All the proper procedures are being followed here," said Dr. Richard
Jackson, public health officer for the state Department of Health
Services, which is investigating. [I am sure that the DHS follows
proper procedures. - Mod.MHJ]
The institute's researchers believed they were working with a dead
sample of the anthrax bacterium, but were inadvertently shipped live
anthrax by their supplier, Southern Research Institute of Frederick,
MD, hospital officials said. Children's Hospital Oakland Research
Institute is not authorized to handle live anthrax. The sealed liquid
agent was shipped via FedEx, double-boxed, about 3 months ago to
Oakland, officials said.
Researchers began injecting what they thought was dead anthrax [bacilli or
spores; 'anthrax' is the disease - Mod.MHJ] into mice 28 May 2004. Over that
weekend, 10 mice died in separate cages, and animal handlers placed the mice
in a freezer. It was not brought to the immediate attention of lead
researchers that all the mice in the 1st experiment had died.
Last Friday, another batch of mice was inoculated with the deadly
agent. On Monday, those mice, too, were dead, and the lead researcher
obtained cultures from the cavity of a dead mouse. By Wednesday, the
researchers discovered the anthrax organism growing [in] the
abdominal cavity of the dead mouse.
"From there, the investigations continued at a rapid pace," said Dr.
Ann Petru, a pediatric infectious disease expert at the institution.
The institute contacted the state Department of Health Services and
the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which
launched their own investigations. Agents from the Federal Bureau of
Investigation's bioterror unit transported the infected dead mice to
the state's laboratory in Richmond on Wednesday afternoon, where
evidence of the live bacterium was confirmed.
Samples have been sent to the CDC in Atlanta for further testing,
Jackson said. Nasal samples from the lab workers are also being
evaluated, with results expected next week, Petru said. CDC
spokeswoman Rhonda Smith said how the live agent was accidentally
sent to Children's Hospital is under investigation. "We're working
with the California Department of Health Services, the shipping and
receiving institutions and the FBI to determine what happened and how
we can prevent it from happening again," Smith said.
Southern Research Institute's Thomas Voss, who is in charge of the
institute's emerging infectious disease program, said the company is
investigating what happened. He said it's unclear whether the
institute did ship live anthrax to Oakland. Voss said the institute's
hot labs in Frederick and Birmingham, Ala., handle most "select
agents" listed with the CDC, and that they are one of 350 entities
registered to handle live anthrax. He said the institute rarely ships
out the agents. "We receive agents on a routine basis," Voss said.
"But on our end, we ship very infrequently. I can't even recall
shipping live agents."
Dr. Frederick Murphy, a microbiologist at University of California,
Davis, said such mixups are extremely rare. "It's much more serious
than it used to be," Murphy said. "There's all kinds of protocols in
place to prevent these mistakes." Namely, deadly live bacteria
require extensive permits to ship and are typically handled by
couriers. The agents would be encased in a safe-like container to
prevent tampering or any exposure.
Edward Hammond, director of the Sunshine Project, a watchdog group on
biological weapons research, said with so many federal funds pouring into
biodefense research, there should be more controls in place. "This hospital
clearly did not have the ambition [sic -- ability? capacity?] to handle such
agents," Hammond said.
Neighbors of the institute, located on Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, are
wondering the same thing. "When (the institute) opened, they told us they
would be researching meningitis, but they never talked about anthrax," said
Bob Brokyl, a North Oakland activist. Brokyl noted that a senior center is
housed in the same building as the institute, which is surrounded by a
working-class neighborhood. "I'm really angry and nervous because ... {T]hey
said they would never have anything dangerous there. The great children's
hospitals of our country are where a lot of the most incredible research is
done -- major research in infectious disease," he said.

[We need reports like this on a Friday afternoon to lighten the week. It is
hard to work out what they were trying to do by injecting mice with a dead
product. My one suspicion, if they knew what they were up to, would be to
develop antibodies to the spore exosporium. Michelle Mock at the Pasteur
Institute, Paris, has nicely shown that if you mix dead spores with PA
[protective antigen] you get enhanced immunity. Sterne vaccine is pathogenic
for mice at certain doses but can be used safely at lower doses. Plus it is
available and certainly cheaper than whatever they got from SRI, which might
well have been intended to be dead Sterne anyway. From their nasal swabbing
to the pointless prescription of Cipro, institutional spin, and the certainty
of official visits from CDC, there is enough to satisfy anyone's need for
schadenfreude and superiority. With the unbelievable sums of money flowing
around the US in response to the perceived BT threats, it is a wonder that we
have not had more reports of institutional embarrassment like this. Before
the letters of 2001 there were probably only about a dozen US institutes
working with _B. anthracis_; now apparently there are 350. Are we better off?
Enjoy your weekend. Thanks also to Philip Henika and Paul Cheek for sending
reports on this event. - Mod.MHJ]
