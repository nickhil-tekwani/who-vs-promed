An outbreak of cholera has killed 5 people in the Angolan province of Uige, which has been plagued by an outbreak of the disease since last week, government officials said. According to the governor of the Uíge province, Mpinda Simão, in addition to a malaria outbreak, the province now faces cases of cholera, already confirmed by the health authorities. "In addition to malaria, the cholera epidemic has arisen. At first, we were not sure; the technicians did their work; we received confirmation that the cases of diarrhea that we have here in the province are linked to cholera," said Mpinda Simão in statements issued by Angolan public radio.

The secretary of state for public health, José Vieira Dias da Cunha, who went to that northern province of Angola to assess the situation, said that there is a need for improvement in basic sanitation and distribution of drinking water to avoid these situations. "It is very important that we all know that cholera is a disease that has a lot to do with environmental sanitation and the distribution of drinking water. If these 2 issues are properly resolved, it is difficult for a population to contract this type of disease," he stressed.

The cholera epidemic is affecting the 3 main neighborhoods of the city of Uíge, according to health authorities.

Cholera cases have now reached 2000 in Zambia's capital Lusaka, health authorities said on Mon 1 Jan 2018. Stanslous Ngosa, head of communications and external relations at the Ministry of Health, said 42 people have died since the outbreak of the waterborne disease in October 2017. He said cumulative cases were now close to 2000, a situation that has forced authorities to come up with stringent measures to curb the rising cases. The ministry, he said, has since banned large public gatherings such as weddings and musicals, banned street vending until further notice, while all markets should remain closed to facilitate extensive cleanups in a bid to contain the spread of cholera.

On Fri 29 Dec 2017, President Edgar Lungu ordered the defense wings to get involved in curbing the further spread of the disease, a move that saw the soldiers conducting a clean-up exercise in the central business district and a sprawling flea market on Sun 31 Dec 2017. The Zambian leader, who inspected the cleaning exercise, urged civic leaders in the city to stay vigilant and work hard to halt the further spread of the disease.

The waterborne disease, which initially broke out in 2 densely populated slums in the city, has since spread to low density areas.

In the DRC, health minister Oly Ilunga is deploring a new cholera outbreak in Kinshasa. Since 27 Nov 2017, 123 cases and 10 deaths have been reported, according to official figures. The health minister, however, argued that Kinshasa is not endemic for cholera and that everything is being done to contain the epidemic.

Cases of this cholera epidemic have been reported since 27 Nov 2017 in the Camp Luka district west of the city of Kinshasa. According to minister of health Oly Ilunga, these cases were imported from neighboring Kongo Central Province. "This man [the 1st recorded case in Kinshasa] stayed in Kimpese in Kongo Central [a Congo DR province formerly called Bas-Congo - Mod.LL] before going to Kinshasa. The alert was given immediately, and the provincial health division immediately took the lead to launch the response," he said.

Since January 2017, Kinshasa has experienced 444 cases and 38 deaths. According to the minister of health, this outbreak declared since November 2017 has no connection with previous cases of cholera reported in the capital. "The cases they had in early 2017 in April/May at Camp Kokolo were actually imported cases from the Equator," said Oly Ilunga.

According to the minister, the Kinshasa health system is equipped and ready to contain this epidemic. "This is not the 1st time that the province of Kinshasa is facing a cholera outbreak, and our teams in the provincial division are equipped to carry out the response against this disease," he said. Oly Ilunga also requested the involvement of the press to sensitize the public to respect basic hygiene measures.

[4] Cholera - Kenya (Meru County)

Three people have died and more than 20 admitted in various hospitals following a cholera outbreak in Tigania West, Meru County. Dozens of those affected were admitted at Ruiri Health Centre, Chaaria Mission Hospital, Meru Level Five Hospital and Isiolo hospital, while many more face the risk owing to denial and poor response by authorities in the region.

"We have tried calling for help to find out what the disease is, because we have lost people, and we are wondering what is going on because people are dying from the hospital, some from their homes, and we would like the government to intervene," said a Lairang'i resident. Although county officials try to downplay the outbreak, most of the cases have exhibited cholera symptoms.

Meru County Health CEC [County Executive Committee member] Dr Eunice Kobia has since denied the reports, further assuring area residents that health personnel and public officer teams have been dispatched to the affected areas to monitor the situation. Kobia further cautioned people against consuming foods being sold by the roadside by unlicensed vendors.

Locals now want the government to scale up medical emergency responses to mitigate possible spread of the epidemic. About 336 cases of cholera were treated since June 2017, forcing the government to close several hotels to contain the situation.

Health officials in Busia County are on high alert following an outbreak of cholera that has claimed 5 lives.

20 people are receiving treatment at the Teso North Sub County referral hospital, Kocholya. The patients, who had been exhibiting vomiting and diarrhea symptoms, are believed to have contracted the deadly bacterial disease after consuming food at a party engagement in Uganda before crossing back to the country. They were complaining of stomach pains, vomiting, and diarrhea.

According to medical officials in the area, more than 29 people with similar cases had been treated, with the outbreak expected to escalate due to deficient sanitation and lack of access to clean drinking water in the area.

Teso North Sub County public health officer Dr Kelvin Tangara says 4 cases tested positive for cholera.

[6] Cholera - Somalia
Date: Sun 24 Dec 2017

Data from the Ministry of Health in Somalia suggest that the cholera outbreak reported in 2017 in the country is gradually levelling off. The number of cholera cases and deaths have significantly decreased in recent months, and no deaths were recorded from August up to November 2017. The number of cases reported during the month of November is the lowest in 2017.

Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal infection caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. The majority of infected individuals develop moderate to mild symptoms, whereas a minority develop acute watery diarrhea, which can lead to death within hours if left untreated. Cholera is an endemic disease in Somalia.

The current surge of cholera cases began in November 2016 when the country was reeling from a severe drought. As the coverage of the early warning surveillance system is limited in the country owing to inaccessibility and other security concerns, the cholera data reported from Somalia so far may have been an underestimation of what actually plausibly occurred.

Between January 2017 and November 2017, a total of 78 784 cholera cases including 1159 associated deaths (case fatality rate [CFR] 1.47 per cent) were reported across 52 districts of the country. A majority of the cases and deaths occurred in April 2017. There is a remarkable decrease in the reported cases and number of deaths after the month of August 2017 (see graph [for graph and table, see original URL. - Mod.LL]). Moreover, fewer districts have been reporting cases in the month of November 2017 compared to previous months (see table). This reported decline might have been attributed to the use of oral cholera vaccine in Somalia to prevent and contain the outbreak.

The country implemented the 1st oral cholera vaccination (OCV) campaigns in which at least 1 015 406 people aged one year and above were targeted for vaccination with 2 doses administered at least 2 weeks apart in 9 hotspots of central and southern regions of Somalia. To establish the performance of the campaign, OCV coverage surveys were also conducted to determine the OCV coverage in phase 1 and phase II implementations. Approximately 92.7 per cent coverage for the 2 doses of OCV was achieved during phase 1 while during phase II, the coverage for 2 doses of OCV was 94.1per cent. The oral vaccination campaign was preceded by extensive social mobilization efforts to inform the community of the benefits, availability and necessity of the vaccine.

These efforts have led to successful containment of the outbreak. Despite the declining trend of cholera in the country, surveillance and response efforts should continue in all hot spots. Vigilance must be continued to sustain the progress achieved in controlling the outbreak.

Coordination and collaboration between all agencies and local communities should continue.

[7] Cholera - India (Karnataka State)

http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2017/dec/31/bengaluru-two-workers-die-of-cholera-30-hospitalised-1740863.html


Two construction laborers died and about 30 others were taken ill after consuming water which was allegedly contaminated, at a construction site at Varthur in the city. The incident occurred on Fri 29 Dec 2017 but came to light only on the next day after several of them were rushed to a hospital. Police said the workers complained of severe diarrhea and nausea after having water at the Sobha Dream Acres site on Balagere Road, where they are camped.

While a 20 year old was brought dead to the hospital after a severe bout of diarrhea, another laborer, whose identity is yet to be established, died at the hospital. The realty firm issued a statement saying: "We have taken quick steps on one hand to investigate the matter and, on the other, to get the affected workmen treated. We are monitoring the situation closely."

Dr Sanjiv Lewin, chief of medical services at St John's Medical College and Hospital confirmed that 2 laborers died due to cholera. He said that the laborers were found to have _Vibrio cholerae_ infection, a serious bacterial infection that is caused by the contamination of water due to fecal matter.

[Karnataka is a state in the south western region of India. It was formed on 1 Nov 1956, with the passage of the States Reorganization Act. Originally known as the State of Mysore, it was renamed Karnataka in 1973. Only a small part of the state corresponds to the Carnatic region. The capital and largest city is Bangalore (Bengaluru). It can be seen on maps at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka and Karnataka State, India https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=5533961,307.

The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
