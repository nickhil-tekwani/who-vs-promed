Marine toxin infects 8 more people
-------------------------
The number of people falling ill from a marine toxin rose by 8 yesterday,
and the government said it is considering changing the law to allow more
tests on some imported fish.
In the past 3 days, 53 people have been sickened by ciguatoxin -- a poison
that occurs naturally in some tropical fish. All have been released from
hospital.
The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department said it is considering
amending the law to test more imported reef fish for the toxin. Department
director Gregory Leung said suppliers currently provide small quantities of
reef fish for testing by the government. He said the government is
considering changing the law to increase the number of tests made on
imported fish.
He did not say whether the planned changes would mean that testing would be
made compulsory. But Leung said it was difficult to determine whether fish
had been caught within the territory's marine boundaries.
"We need to consider measures to monitor the catching and loading of the fish."
One fish supplier in Kwun Tong voluntarily destroyed 2000 _Plectropomus
areolatus_ and recalled about 6 tonnes of the fish from retailers after
suspicions were raised that stocks were contaminated.
Leung urged members of the public to avoid eating big reef fish altogether.
Previously they were merely warned to avoid eating the internal organs of
fish -- the toxin usually accumulates in the liver and gonads.
People were also told to avoid drinking alcohol or eating nuts together
with the fish, because the combination can exacerbate the effects of the
poisoning.
The main symptoms of ciguatera fish poisoning are numbness of the mouth and
limbs, vomiting, diarrhoea, hot and cold flushes, and aching joints and
muscles. Members of the public must seek medical attention if they suspect
they have seafood poisoning.
While symptoms usually subside after a few days, in severe cases the
neurological symptoms can persist for months or even years. In some cases,
infected patients can suffer relapses years after their recovery. Relapses
are associated with major changes to diet or alcohol consumption.
There is a low incidence of death from ciguatera fish poisoning. Death is
usually from respiratory and cardiovascular failure.

Public advised to be cautious of ciguatera fish poisoning
---------------------------------
The Department of Health today (29 Mar 2004) advised the public to be extra
cautious of eating large coral reef fish, particularly those weighing over
2 catties [one catty = approx. 1.3 lbs or 600 g], as they may contain
ciguatoxin, which may cause food poisoning.
The advice followed 7 food poisoning cases, affecting a total of 30
persons, suspected to be caused by fish containing ciguatoxin in the last 2
days. These people aged between 6 and 74 years, developed symptoms of
ciguatoxin poisoning after eating coral reef fish including areolated coral
grouper and leopard coral grouper. All of them are in stable condition,
including 14 in hospitals.
A spokesman for the Department said ciguatera fish poisoning is not
uncommon in tropical areas. This is mainly associated with the consumption
of big coral reef fish that have accumulated the toxin in their bodies, in
particular internal organs, through eating small fish that consume toxic
algae in areas with coral reefs.
The larger fish is therefore more likely to carry higher amounts of the
toxin. However, one cannot readily tell from the appearance of the fish
whether it contains the toxin. Though less common, the chance of toxin
accumulating in smaller fish cannot be ruled out.
People affected may show symptoms of numbness of the mouth and the limbs,
vomiting, diarrhoea, reversal of sensation of cold and heat, and pains of
the joints and muscles.
He said that most persons affected by ciguatoxin will recover without
long-term health effects. However, if excessive toxin is consumed, the
circulatory and nervous systems will be affected.
"The toxin cannot be destroyed by cooking", the spokesman said.
To prevent ciguatera fish poisoning, the spokesman advised that the
following should be observed:
- Avoid consuming large coral reef fish; the bigger the fish, the higher
the risk of ciguatera poisoning.
- Avoid eating the internal organs -- especially liver and gonads -- of
big coral reef fish, because the toxin tends to accumulate there;
- Eat only a small quantity of coral reef fish at any one meal;
- Do not consume coral reef fish together with alcoholic beverages and
nuts; and
- Seek medical care when symptoms appear.

[Background information on ciguatera poisoning can be found at the FDA
Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition website:
<http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/chap36.html>
"Ciguatera is a form of human poisoning caused by the consumption of
subtropical and tropical marine finfish which have accumulated naturally
occurring toxins through their diet. The toxins are known to originate from
several dinoflagellate (algae) species that are common to ciguatera endemic
regions in the lower latitudes.
Manifestations of ciguatera in humans usually involves a combination of
gastrointestinal, neurological, and cardiovascular disorders. Symptoms
defined within these general categories vary with the geographic origin of
toxic fish.
Clinical testing procedures are not presently available for the diagnosis
of ciguatera in humans. Diagnosis is based entirely on symptomatology and
recent dietary history. An enzyme immunoassay (EIA) designed to detect
toxic fish in field situations is under evaluation by the Association of
Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) and may provide some measure of
protection to the public in the future.
Marine finfish most commonly implicated in ciguatera fish poisoning include
the groupers, barracudas, snappers, jacks, mackerel, and triggerfish. Many
other species of warm-water fishes harbor ciguatera toxins. The occurrence
of toxic fish is sporadic, and not all fish of a given species or from a
given locality will be toxic."
In the newswire article, the fish mentioned, _Plectropomus areolatus_, is
commonly known as the Squaretail Coral Grouper. - Mod.MPP]
