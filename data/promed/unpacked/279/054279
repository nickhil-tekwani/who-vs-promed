The occurrence of cases of bovine rabies in Agua Buena [Tamasopo municipality, San Luis Potosi state] generated alarm among farmers. More than 10 cases have been reported during the last weeks, and this situation is dangerous, since it may result in an outbreak that could put humans at risk, said a local inhabitant of this area.

He said the outbreak is increasing, placing at risk the local farmers. If not controlled on time, rabies may affect all cattle in the area and cause high mortality rates in animals. For this reason, local farmers requested support from health and sanitation authorities to implement a barrier and control this problem that has already affected more than 10 animals.

He also mentioned that this condition is dangerous for humans, since, if a person has an open wound, he/she may acquire the disease, and [if the post-exposure vaccine is not administered, will inevitably die]. For these reasons, it is important to pay attention to this problem that is affecting not only farmers, but which may affect the general population.

[The article does not state that the rabies is from a bat, but it seems quite likely. Specifically it may be a vampire bat, and this may be paralytic rabies.

Bat rabies is dangerous to people as well. However bovines infected with rabies may be a danger to the animal owner or veterinarian. These are large animals compared to a human. They can inflict pain and damage on a human easily and even more so when they may be afflicted with a disease.

The virus causing bovine paralytic rabies is transmitted by _Desmodus rotundus_, the most common vampire bat in the tropics and sub-tropics in the Americas. An image of _Desmodus rotundus_ can be accessed at http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/common-vampire-bat.html.
