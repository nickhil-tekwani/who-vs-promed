Dr E. J. Threlfall and colleagues reported, in a Research Letter in this
week's Lancet, that about 15% of salmonella infections in the UK are caused
by strains resistant to at least four antibiotics. They added that the
organism is also developing resistance to other drugs.
Infection with multidrug-resistant _Salmonella typhimurium_ DT 104, the
second most common _Salmonella_ in human beings, was first recorded in 1990
in the UK, and in 1997 in the USA. About 95% of isolates are multidrug
resistant, and the resistant organism is now widespread in cattle and human
beings in both countries. This could have serious consequences in
immunosuppressed groups of patients. In a report from the USA, 13% of cases
had a more serious illness, with bloodstream invasion. _Salmonella_
poisoning can cause death, particularly in very young and elderly patients.
Hospital
treatment is often necessary. Dr. Threlfall and colleagues conclude that
the choice of drugs for physicians, if antibiotic treatment is needed, is
becoming limited.
