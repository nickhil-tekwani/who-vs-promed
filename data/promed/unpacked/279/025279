An old virus that shares similar symptoms to dengue fever had resurfaced in Cambodia in recent months and was a leading factor in this year's sharp spike in deaths attributed to dengue, health officials said yesterday [14 May 2012]. [But CHIKV normally has a much lower CFR (case fatality rate) than dengue. - Mod.JW]

Last seen in Cambodia in the early 1990s, the chikungunya, or CHIKV, virus had re-emerged in Cambodia over the past 6-9 months, World Health Organization epidemiologist Steven Bjorge said. "It's been moving through India, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand; now it appears it has reached Cambodia," he said.

Although a completely different virus, it is often confused with dengue, as the symptoms are similar and the species of the mosquito is the same, he said. However, dengue symptoms tended to be more severe, with people potentially dying from them, unlike CHIKV. "The problem is that with those viruses, there is no drug to stop the symptoms, likewise there is no vaccine. The only thing we have left is to protect against mosquitoes," he said.

_Aedes_ mosquitoes [_Aedes aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ in SE Asia], which transmit the viruses, tended to breed in man-made containers, he said, adding that putting larvicide or guppy fish in pools of water and cleaning up small piles of trash would be a good way of guarding against them.

Char Meng Chuor, director of the National Center for Parasitology, Entomology and Malaria Control, said the similarity of the viruses and the rise in CHIKV cases had partly contributed to a 3-fold increase in dengue numbers. There were 2579 cases, with 14 deaths, more than the 1st 18 weeks of the year [2012] -- an increase of 353 per cent if compared to the same period last year.

Other reasons for the increase in reported dengue cases included more rainfall and this year being the climax of a 5-year cycle that tends to see more deaths, he added. Health officials have distributed 90 tonnes of Abate, a chemical used to kill [mosquito] larvae, and will distribute 180 tonnes during the rainy season.

[Unfortunately, no indication is given about the proportion of the 2579 cases mentioned above that are due to dengue and to chikungunya virus infections, nor the basis on which the presence of chikungunya virus infections was determined. Chikungunya virus is endemic in Southeast Asia, and tends to appear in sporadic outbreaks there. Although this is the 1st ProMED-mail report of chikungunya virus infections in Cambodia, outbreaks have been reported in neighboring Thailand (see ProMED-mail archive number 20090515.1818).

Dengue viruses are flaviviruses and chikungunya virus is an alphavirus, so there is no serological cross-reactivity between them, although their clinical symptoms are very similar. Although the case fatality rate of chikungunya virus infections is extremely low or nil, they produce acute arthralgia that may persist weeks or even months after the acute phase of the illness, and may be incapacitating. - Mod.TY
