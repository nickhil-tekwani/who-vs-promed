Egypt: 5 million infected with hepatitis C virus
-----------------------------------------------
At least 5 million people in Egypt are infected with the hepatitis C
virus (HCV), a new committee formed by the country's government to
tackle the disease has stated. It added that action must be taken now
to combat rising mortality.
"The annual infection rate is more than 70 000 new cases, of which at
least 35 000 would have chronic hepatitis C," said Dr. Manal
el-Sayed, Professor of Pediatrics at Cairo's Ain Shams University and
member of the National Hepatitis Committee, which is currently
formulating an action plan to fight the disease.
Hepatitis C virus is a lethal virus which can cause liver cirrhosis
and cancer. Egypt has one of the highest prevalence rates of the
virus in the world, say specialists. An estimated 10-15 percent of
the population, some 8-10 million people, are carrying hepatitis C
virus antibodies, meaning that they either have or at one time had
the virus. Five million of those are actively infected, according to
government figures. No vaccine is available for HCV although it can
be treated with a combination of drugs if detected early enough.
Egypt's very high prevalence of HCV is largely the legacy of
government campaigns prior to 1980 to treat rural populations for
schistosomiasis (or bilharzia), a water-borne disease which at one
time was endemic in Egypt. The treatment campaigns, which involved
repeated injections, did not follow rigorous hygiene standards and as
such spread blood-borne HCV throughout the population.
As it may take up to 30 years for a patient to display symptoms of
HCV infection or for the disease to become active, the full extent of
the problem has only recently become known. "The main risk factor,
according to all the studies done in Egypt, is treatment in the past
for schistosomiasis," said Dr. Amr Kandeel, Director of the
Communicable Disease Department at the Egyptian Ministry of Health
and Population. "At that time, the Ministry treated people in the
villages without using disposable syringes," he added.
In addition to cases among the older population, new infections are
still being recorded, due to poor medical practices and behavioral
factors. Deaths from liver disease are, therefore, expected to
increase in Egypt within the next 20 years. "If we consider that by
the year 2020 we are going to have so many patients who are having
liver failure and liver cancer, treating them now is more effective
than leaving them to that outcome," said el-Sayed.
Egypt's hepatitis committee is now making plans to prevent and treat
hepatitis C. Treatment of HCV is usually done with a drug called
Interferon [interferon-alpha?]. However, the most typical type of HCV
in Egypt has about a 40 percent resistance to the drug. Although
research is ongoing, no more effective treatment is yet available.
Nevertheless, the committee has succeeded in brokering a deal with
the manufacturers of Interferon to supply the drug to Ministry of
Health hospitals for 1/3rd of the usual price, and treatment under
the committee's program has begun in selected centers.
Even with the cost of Interferon reduced, the financial burden of
Egypt's HCV problem is huge. The committee estimates that of the 5
million people actively infected with the virus, around one million
currently need treatment. A year's treatment for a person with signs
of liver damage from HCV costs around LE 25 000 (about USD 4500), a
sum few can afford.
In January this year [2007], the committee began fundraising
activities with the help of NGOs [non-governmental organizations] and
international organizations including USAID [United States Agency for
International Development], the World Health Organization and UNICEF.
The committee hopes to be able to provide free treatment to those most in need.
"We would also like to appeal to the international community to help
with this campaign by whatever means possible," said el-Sayed. Due to
the cost and difficulty of treating chronic HCV patients, promoting
awareness to prevent the disease, and detecting those infected before
they develop liver damage are critical factors. "We are going to
promote screening for high-risk populations, including healthcare
professionals who are at risk from needle injuries, and those who are
undergoing repeated blood transfusion treatment," said el-Sayed. The
hepatitis committee has stressed the need for good infection control
programs in hospitals and among healthcare professionals to stem the
transmission of the virus. The Egyptian Ministry of Health is
cooperating through its National Infection Control Program, which
began in 2003.
Those at risk of new HCV infections in Egypt are not just those in
medical contact with existing patients, however. The children and
relatives of individuals affected during the schistosomiasis campaign
are also a high-risk group, as widespread behavioral practices --
such as the re-use of syringes, sharing of toothbrushes and even
circumcision -- all increase the risk of contracting blood-borne
viruses such as HIV and Hepatitis C. And although the circumcision of
girls is officially banned in Egypt, the practice still continues,
placing girls who are being circumcised at a very high risk of
contracting HCV. "Sometimes there is a sort of celebration for mass
circumcision in certain communities. Girls are at a higher risk,
because it is a very bloody procedure. However, female circumcision
has dramatically decreased, with more awareness and a ban by law,"
said el-Sayed.
As part of its Unite for Children, Unite Against Aids campaign,
UNICEF Egypt has also been trying to raise awareness of the more
common dangers of contracting HCV. Changing people's behavior and
attitudes toward blood safety is key, according to Wessam el-Beih,
UNICEF's Unite Against Aids Egypt coordinator.

[It remains to be seen whether interferon treatment alone will have a
significant effect on chronic hepatitis C virus infection in Egyptian
patients. Sequence comparison between isolates of hepatitis C virus
(HCV) indicated that HCV can be classified into a series of distinct
genotypes, and genotype 4a is the most prevalent hepatitis C
virus-genotype (85 percent) in Egypt (see, for example: J Egypt
Public Health Assoc. 1998;73(1-2):41-55). Only 21 percent of Egyptian
patients responded to interferon treatment. It may be necessary to
combine interferon and ribavirin (an RNA virus replication inhibitor)
treatment to have any appreciable effect on chronic hepatitis C
infections in Egypt. - Mod.CP]
