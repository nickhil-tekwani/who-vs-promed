City [Chennai, Tamil Nadu state] doctors are seeing an increasing number of patients with scrub typhus, a fever usually seen in rural areas. From a diseases caused by mites, prevalent during winter, it is now seen all through the year, say doctors.

Infectious diseases specialist Dr V Ramasubramanian says 1 in every 10 febrile patients is found to have scrub typhus. "It is a very treatable condition, provided the patient comes in early. We are now seeing people even from posh areas within the city," he says. The lack of affordable testing facilities for the illness is a dampener for early diagnosis, he points out.

Caused by the bite of larval mites that are found in shrubs and other grass-like vegetation in the countryside, scrub typhus has symptoms like leptospirosis and typhoid -- body temperature above 103 degrees Fahrenheit, chills, diarrhoea, gastro-intestinal trouble, and sometimes difficulty in breathing, says Dr S Balasubramanian, joint director (epidemics) at the directorate of public health.

"What sets the illness apart is the tiny dark bite mark on the skin, known as eschar. As the mites stick on clothing when people brush past bushes or sandy areas, the ticks generally bite those areas where the contact of the skin to the dress is the most, like the waist, or the groin," he says. These mites are found on the skin of animals like buffaloes, cows and dogs and they spread to humans after they fall off and come in contact with human skin.

Infectious diseases specialist at Global Hospital Dr Subramanian Swaminathan says while it is essential that anybody with a fever persistent for more than 2 days should consult a physician, it is important that clinicians also look out for signs of scrub typhus after ruling out other bacterial fevers. "Scrub typhus mimics several other ailments like brain infection, pneumonia and lung infections. So it is important that doctors read the symptoms right and look for the eschar," he said.

Dr Balasubramanian warned that the fever, if untreated for more than 10 days, could cause severe complications like swelling of the lungs, brain encephalitis, renal failure or even heart problems.

While the incidence of the fever is generally high during winter, scrub typhus is prevalent all through the year now, said Dr Swaminathan who sees at least 5 cases a month. "It is a very treatable condition, provided the patient comes in early. They are put on inexpensive antibiotic doxycycline and recover quickly after the course," says the doctor.
