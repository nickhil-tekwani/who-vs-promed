Likely low-path bird flu found in West Virginia -- USDA
-------------------------------------------------------
Turkeys at a farm in West Virginia (WV) have tested positive for what
government officials believe is a low-pathogenic strain of the bird
flu virus, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said late on
Sunday [1 Apr 2007].
Preliminary tests indicated the turkeys had a low pathogenic H5N2
avian influenza virus. USDA officials said they can say "for certain"
it's not the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus (HPAI) that has spread
through birds in Asia, Europe, and Africa.
A spokesman with the West Virginia Department of Agriculture would
not identify the farm but said it was located in Pendleton County in
the east-central part of the state [see map at

"Every indication is that the virus is consistent with low pathogenic
strains of avian influenza, or LPAI, which are commonly found in
birds and typically cause only minor sickness or no noticeable
symptoms," USDA Chief Veterinarian John Clifford said in a statement.
He added the detection in West Virginia should not "significantly
impact" exports of U.S. poultry.
The samples were collected by an industry group as part of a routine
before slaughter, USDA said. The birds showed no sign of illness or
mortality. The samples were collected on Friday [30 Mar 2007] from a
flock of about 25 000 birds that will now be destroyed to prevent the
virus from mutating and spreading.
A low-pathogenic strain, which produces less disease and mortality in
birds than does a high-pathogenic version, poses no threat to humans.
In an effort to monitor for bird flu, USDA and the Department of
Interior worked with states to collect more than 100 000 wild bird
samples in 2006. The testing program detected a low pathogenic bird
flu strain in 6 states.
The latest highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu strain in Asia, Europe,
and Africa is known to have killed at least 169 people and forced
hundreds of millions of birds to be destroyed.

[In Feb 2004, an outbreak of H5N2 was diagnosed in a chicken farm in
Gonzalez County, State of Texas; USDA confirmed that the H5N2 strain
was highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). On 1 Apr 2004, the USDA
informed the Office International des Epizooties (OIE -- World Animal
Health Organization) about the completion of the eradication of the
said outbreak, indicating that all States, Territories, and regions
in the United States were free of HPAI.
Reportedly, the current outbreak in turkeys is caused by an avian
influenza virus, subtype H5, which is "likely to be" of low
pathogenicity. According OIE's International Health Code chapter
2.7.12, this is a case of Notifiable Avian Influenza (NAI), defined
as "an infection of poultry caused by any influenza A virus of the H5
or H7 subtypes or by any AI virus with an intravenous pathogenicity
index (IVPI) greater than 1.2 (or as an alternative at least 75
percent mortality".
NAI viruses can be divided into highly pathogenic notifiable avian
influenza (HPNAI) and low pathogenicity notifiable avian influenza
(LPNAI). The latter are all influenza A viruses of H5 and H7 subtype
that are not HPNAI viruses. Pending upon final laboratory results,
the current outbreak in Virginia seems to be LPNAI.
For further details on the possible national and international
implications of LPNAI occurrence (which are, obviously, of less
severity than those related to HPNAI), refer to
