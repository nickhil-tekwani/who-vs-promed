More than 2 dozen boys were reportedly taken to hospitals in Rockland County, the Catskills, and Brooklyn after they apparently suffered food poisoning while returning from a trip to Ukraine. The boys, all in their upper teens, were nauseous, vomiting, and feverish, among other reactions, after landing at an unidentified New York City airport, responders said. They apparently had been eating tuna sandwiches before their flight and began feeling ill during the journey, according to unconfirmed reports.

The Vishnitzer Chassidim groups had all traveled together to visit Mezibuz [Ukraine], The Yeshiva World reported. Rockland Hatzolah set up a command setup at its Monsey garage after at least 8 boys were reported sick. Another boy, from Vishnitz Yeshiva in Kiamesha Lake, Sullivan County, also reportedly was hospitalized.

In Brooklyn, NY, 18 boys from Yeshiva Bochrim were dropped off by a school bus at the Boro Park Hatzolah garage on 14th Avenue, where a mass casualty incident was reported, The Yeshiva World reported. The borough teens were taken to Maimonides, Lutheran, Methodist, and Cobble Hill hospitals, responders said.

[It appears that the vehicles for transmission of the illnesses were pre-made tuna sandwiches. It is not entirely clear what the incubation period between ingestion of the sandwich and the onset of symptoms but it was certainly likely to be less than a day. A short incubation foodborne illness primarily with vomiting is suggestive of staphylococcal enterotoxin-associated illness where foods are not adequately handled and _Staphylococcus aureus_ is allowed to grow and produce toxin. A toxin dose of less than 1.0 microgram in contaminated food will produce symptoms of staphylococcal intoxication. This toxin level is reached when _S. aureus_ populations exceed 100 000 per gram.

Foods that are frequently incriminated in staphylococcal food poisoning include meat and meat products; poultry and egg products; salads such as egg, tuna, chicken, potato, and macaroni; bakery products such as cream-filled pastries, cream pies, and chocolate eclairs; sandwich fillings; and milk and dairy products. Foods that require considerable handling during preparation, and that are kept at slightly elevated temperatures after preparation, are frequently involved in staphylococcal food poisoning.

Those affected were all members of an Orthodox Jewish group visiting an important religious site. Mezibuz or Mezhbizh (also spelled as Medzibuz, Mezbuz, Mez'buz, and in various other ways, transcribed from various Yiddish dialects) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mezhbizh] is the name of the town of Medzhybizh in the present Ukraine which is significant as both the source of a Hasidic dynasty that bears its name and as a symbolic name for the roots of Hasidism. The Mezhbizh dynasty served as the earliest "trunk" of Hasidic Judaism, led by the Baal Shem Tov and his direct descendants. - Mod.LL
