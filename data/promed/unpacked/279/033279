Parents in Devon are being sent home a letter warning of an ongoing outbreak of measles. Public Health England (PHE) have confirmed there have been 71 cases in the South West this year [2018] following an increase in cases throughout England and Europe. So far the local measles cases have centred on Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire. It means unimmunised individuals will be at a real increased risk of contracting the infection.

In the letter parents are being asked for their support in raising awareness of measles and to get their children vaccinated with the MMR [measles, mumps and rubella] vaccine. Among the Devon schools to have sent the letter out is Torquay Grammar School, but PHE have confirmed there have been no reported cases of measles recently in the Torbay or Devon area. There have been no confirmed cases in Devon this year [2018].

A spokesperson for PHE said: "The letters have been issued to provide information about the increase in cases across the UK and Europe to make people aware of symptoms, especially if they are travelling this summer, to check their vaccination status, and ensure they are up to date with their MMR vaccination. It also states the importance of exclusion if people suspect that they have measles - for example, not attending nursery, school, work, large events etc if you are symptomatic. We also advise to contact health services ahead if you are planning to attend GP practices etc so not to potentially infect others if you do have symptoms."

An outbreak of measles has killed dozens of infants and children in Romania, with 200 new cases reported each week. Doctors say the surge in the disease is fueled by low rates of vaccination. Some celebrities have waged media campaigns warning of the perils of immunization, while superstitions such as keeping the vaccine-preventable disease at bay with cabbage juice or not cleaning the house have also exasperated doctors. Some doctors complain they don't have sufficient stocks of vaccines.

Alexandru Rafila, chief of a laboratory at the Matei Bals National Institute for Infectious Diseases in Bucharest, told The Associated Press this week the highly contagious disease spread quicker because millions of Romanians work abroad, exposing themselves to different strains of the virus and then returning home. He said the disease first appeared in a community of Roma in north western Romania in 2016. He said the strain of disease was alien to Romania but often found in Italy.

Some 13 700 people in Romania have contracted measles since the epidemic began in 2016, and 55 have died, of whom only one had been immunized, according to the National Center for the Supervision and Control of Transmissible Diseases. The World Health Organization recommends a 95 per cent level of vaccination; Romania has one of the lowest European rates -- less than 84 per cent. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said the number of measles cases across the continent tripled last year [2017], with Romania, Ukraine and Italy the worst affected.

Doctors like Rafila are also up against celebrities like Olivia Steer, a television personality who has publicly promoted an anti-vaccine stance. "Unfortunately there is an appetite for anything sensational," Rafila said. "People opposed to vaccination are promoted (in the media) in a way which is, shall we say, unethical." Steer declined to speak about her views to the AP.

Research published 20 years ago that linked the vaccine to autism has been discredited, but the scare has made some people wary, Romanian doctors told the AP. In Chitila, a small town just north of Bucharest, Daniela Stefanescu, a pediatrician, was vaccinating babies against measles and other viruses this week. The vaccine provides immunity against measles, mumps and German measles and is administered to 1 year olds with a 2nd dose a few years later. Stefanescu said the high number of deaths from measles made people who were initially skeptical about getting the jab reconsider: "Some of them said 'let me think about it. Maybe I'll have it.'" ...

AHS [Alberta Health Service] has issued a public warning after a case of measles was confirmed in an individual who visited several public areas in Banff at the end of May. "We have a lab-confirmed case of measles in an adult male in Calgary zone, actually lives and works in Banff, that was reported to us on the weekend and we are doing our public health follow-up of anyone that might have been exposed to that individual," said Dr Judy MacDonald, medical officer of health, Calgary Zone. AHS says people who were in the locations listed [at the URL above] at the specified times may have been exposed.

"The concerning thing about this case is there is no history of travel so measles must have come to him in Banff, which is not impossible because we know that measles is doing very well in other parts of the world and so anyone that comes from a measles area to visit could bring measles here," said Dr MacDonald. "Well, this individual contracted it somewhere where they'd been. They hadn't been travelling, they'd just been working, just in Banff so that's what can happen and that's why it's so important, maybe not just focus on that but, to point out to people that measles could be in their family. Just from those exposures, from people travelling and bringing it here."

Officials say people who visited the affected areas during the time periods stated may be at risk of contracting measles if they were born after 1970 and have not had 2 doses of measles vaccine.

"That's the whole point about measles, it does spread very quickly and the best way to protect you is to be immunized and so we've got the potential for people to have been exposed and we could be seeing more cases," MacDonald added. "Measles can be deadly, certainly, especially in young children and older individuals. Sometimes, measles may not result in complete recovery; you may have some lasting complications and unfortunately it does cause death."

A 6 month old child died at the pediatric hospital José Manuel de los Ríos the afternoon of last [Mon 4 Jun 2018]. The child entered the pediatric intensive care unit of the health center [Sat 2 Jun 2018] with respiratory complications and suspected measles.

Efecto Cocuyo understands that the baby died from septic shock resulting from bilateral pneumonia. The baby was born in Trujillo state and his family is resident in the Andean region. It is believed that the respiratory complications were secondary to measles because the child arrived with red spots on the skin, but doctors indicated that it was not possible to confirm the diagnosis of measles because the symptoms were "residual": the exanthema (rash) was disappearing. Nor were specimens taken to make the confirmatory tests.

This would be the 4th death due to measles in José Manuel de los Ríos in one year. The 1st to die was a 1 year old girl from Catia, who died on [8 Feb 2018]. She developed pneumonia, the commonest cause of death associated with measles in infants. Two other deaths, both in children of nursing age [presumably infancy. - Mod.SH] were recorded early in May, one on Sat 5 May 2018 and another on Mon 7 May 2018. The patients were treated in the emergency and in the pediatric intensive care unit of the hospital and presented with respiratory complications.

According to the latest epidemiological bulletin of the Pan American Health Organization, released on [Fri 8 May 2018], the agency reported 2 deaths from measles and 1631 confirmed cases of viral infection in Venezuela since mid-2017.

Measles broke out at Monglenphai and K Sinai village which are located close to Churachandpur district headquarters on [Tue 5 Jun 2018], informed a source. Even though it is said that the outbreak is confined within the 2 villages, the Churachandpur chief medical officer (CMO) today [Fri 8 Jun 2018] submitted a report to the health department.

A 4year old girl died at K Sinai village due to measles in the night of [Tue 5 Jun 2018]. K Sinai village is located about 3 to 4 km [approx 1.8 to 2.5 mi] away from Churachandpur District Hospital. Measles outbreak has also been reported at Monglenphai village under Leisang PHSC of Samulamlan Block.

Dr Jam Thianlal, district family welfare officer [DFWO], Churachandpur issued an outbreak notification on [Wed 6 Jun 2018]. After they were informed about the outbreak by officials of the health department, officials of WHO went to the 2 villages and collected blood samples. They have sent the blood samples to the WHO accredited laboratory located at Guwahati. Medical teams have been sent to both villages to vaccinate children against measles and rubella who missed such vaccination camps held earlier.

Meanwhile, additional director, FWS [family welfare service? - Mod.SH] and state observer (Churachandpur district) of the measles-rubella campaign Dr Th Somorendra Singh rushed to the villages today [Fri 8 Jun 2018] to collect a report of the outbreak at the instruction of the state immunisation officer (SIO). He said that the outbreak was due to resistance by the villagers to the vaccination campaign.

DFWO, Churachandpur has sent measles outbreak report in the district to the director of Health and Family Welfare today [Fri 8 Jun 2018] besides holding an awareness campaign at vulnerable locations since yesterday [Thu 7 Jun 2018]. At the same time, a team comprised of staff from the District Surveillance Office, DFWO and ASHA [? - Mod.SH] Monglenphai collected and sent for laboratory examinations, blood samples and throat swabs of the victims.

Dr Jam Thianlal said, "The victims (of these 2 villages) are found to be resistant families to vaccination during the 2 rounds of Outreach Sessions and 1 round of school session held earlier." Dr Jam Thianlal cautioned that the outbreak can continue since there are some villages which resisted MR vaccination and awareness campaign which was launched in the district since March this year [2018]. He urged all concerned to vaccinate their children aged between 9 months and 15 years, against measles and rubella at the district immunisation office or any nearest public health clinics, which can be done every day.

If all children are vaccinated, the disease would be prevented and the case might be eliminated in the entire state within 2 years, the DWFO said. Dr Th Somorendra Singh urged the people not to panic but vaccinate their children at the earliest.
