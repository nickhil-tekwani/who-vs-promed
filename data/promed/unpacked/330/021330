CWD confirmed in Johnson County
-------------------------------
Chronic wasting disease (CWD), a neurological disease lethal to deer, has
been confirmed in Johnson County, according to officials from the Wyoming
Game and Fish Department. Game and Fish officials have been obtaining
samples for CWD testing this season at meat lockers in Buffalo and Kaycee.

Hank Edwards, pathobiologist at the Wyoming Game and Fish Wildlife Disease
Laboratory in Laramie, Wyoming, said that as of 22 Oct 2009, 2 mule deer
from an area near Ucross had been confirmed positive for CWD. "It is early
in the testing," Edwards said, adding that more work still needs to be done
before the status of CWD in Wyoming can be assessed.

About 2000 samples have been tested and the lab is only about halfway
complete with the CWD testing in Wyoming. The agency expects more animals
to be confirmed positive, especially in the southeastern part of the state.

In September [2009], CWD was discovered in another mule deer buck on the
east side of the Big Horn Mountains in Shell. Last year [2008], 2 buck mule
deer tested positive for CWD near Lake DeSmet and Kaycee. Out of the 4070
deer, elk, and moose that were sampled last year, 125 cases of CWD were
confirmed in Wyoming: 95 mule deer, 14 white-tailed deer, 15 elk and one moose.

[The season for hunting/testing/confirming of CWD in many states has just
begun. This disease has taken on a low level endemic type of activity that
presently shows no signs of dying out. Hopefully more research regarding
the nature of this transmissible spongiform encephalopathy and possible
cures will be investigated. - Mod.TG
