Singapore Halts Dutch Poultry Imports Over Bird Flu
-----------------------------------------------------
Singapore has suspended all imports of poultry and birds from the
Netherlands after bird flu was discovered there, the city state said.
"We have received a report that there is a positive diagnosis of avian
influenza in the Netherlands," the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of
Singapore (AVA) said in a statement.
"To prevent the disease from entering Singapore, AVA is taking
precautionary measures to temporarily suspend the imports of all poultry
and birds from the Netherlands with immediate effect. Singapore is free
from bird flu," it said.
The island imported 447 tonnes of chicken meat from the Netherlands in
2003, which was valued at SGD 850 550 [USD 502 986] and constituted 0.26
percent of total poultry consumption, AVA said. It imported 2066 live
ornamental birds from the Netherlands during 2003 valued at SGD 103 390
[USD 61 141], it said.

A poultry farm culled in Liempde
--------------------------------
The Ministry of Agriculture has announced Monday that during the week-end,
the stamping-out of all poultry in a farm located at Liempde, province of
North-Brabant, was carried out. Antibodies against "fowl-plague" (avian
influenza) were detected in ducks present on the farm; these ducks,
similarly to the ones culled last week in Lopik (Utrecht), were imported.
They were detected by the Ministry's investigation of trade routes. The
culling on Saturday involved 99 birds: 34 ducks, 35 chickens, 3 turkeys, 3
geese, and 24 doves.
Following the detection of antibodies against the mild form of avian
influenza last week in Utrecht, birds on 6 other holdings have undergone
testing. On Thursday, about 1000 birds (ducks, chickens, and doves) were
culled in a holding in Steenbergen (North Brabant). According to the
spokeswoman of the Ministry, 4 other holdings were found negative.
The farm in Liempde is the 4th holding in the Netherlands where animals
have been recently culled following the detection of antibodies against
avian influenza. Previous to Lopik and Steenbergen, an earlier culling was
carried out on a farm in Uithuizermeeden (Groningen). These are
precautionary measures: the Ministry is trying to prevent a mild variant
becoming a highly pathogenic one.

[As previously posted, in the 1st case -- in Groningen, involving
free-range chickens -- Avian influenza (AI) subtype H7 was (serologically)
detected. In the later 3 cases, involving (imported) ducks, AI subtype H5
was detected.
Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is an OIE list A disease, which
should be internationally reported immediately upon suspicion or
confirmation. Since the current cases in the Netherlands are reportedly of
"low pathogenicity", these cases are not HPAI and their immediate reporting
is not required.
More than 4 years ago, in 2000, the EC's Scientific Committee on Animal
Health and Animal Welfare (SCAHAW) recommended that the following
definition of AI be applied to diagnostic procedures for confirmation and
differential diagnosis:
"'Avian influenza' means an infection of poultry caused by any influenza A
virus which has an intravenous pathogenicity index in 6-weeks-old chickens
greater than 1.2 or any infection with influenza A viruses of H5 or H7
subtype".
A similar definition has been proposed by the OIE to its member countries.
If adopted, the discovery of H5 and H7 subtypes in serological surveys --
whatever their pathogenicity index -- will require reporting to the OIE. It
is likely that economic impact would be involved.

Avian Influenza for Eradication Purposes?" - D.J.Alexander, Avian Diseases
