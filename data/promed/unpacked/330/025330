[2] Vaccination of pregnant monkeys

Curbing congenital Zika virus infection
---------------------------------------
The impact on a developing fetus is one of the most pressing concerns for developing vaccines or treatments for Zika virus. To assess fetal protection, Van Rompay et al immunized nonhuman primates with a DNA vaccine before conception and then performed multiple Zika virus challenges in the first few months of pregnancy. Compared to unvaccinated controls, vaccinated animals had reduced viremia in terms of both magnitude and duration. Early fetal loss and fetal pathology was accordingly reduced. These results show that Zika virus vaccines given to women of childbearing age may help prevent damaging sequelae in offspring.

Abstract
--------
Zika virus (ZIKV) infection of pregnant women is associated with congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) and no vaccine is available, although several are being tested in clinical trials. We tested the efficacy of ZIKV DNA vaccine VRC5283 in a rhesus macaque model of congenital ZIKV infection. Most animal vaccine experiments have a set pathogen exposure several weeks or months after vaccination. In the real world, people encounter pathogens years or decades after vaccination, or may be repeatedly exposed if the virus is endemic. To more accurately mimic how this vaccine would be used, we immunized macaques before conception and then exposed them repeatedly to ZIKV during early and mid-gestation. In comparison to unimmunized animals, vaccinated animals had a significant reduction in peak magnitude and duration of maternal viremia, early fetal loss, fetal infection, and placental and fetal brain pathology. Vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody titers on the day of 1st ZIKV exposure were negatively associated with the magnitude of maternal viremia, and the absence of prolonged viremia was associated with better fetal outcomes. These data support further clinical development of ZIKV vaccine strategies to protect against negative fetal outcomes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Zika virus (ZIKV), a recently emerged member of the flavivirus family, forms replication compartments at the ER [endoplasmic reticulum] during its lifecycle. The proteins that are responsible for the biogenesis of replication compartments are not well defined. Here, we show that Zika nonstructural protein 1 (NS1)-induced ER remodeling is essential for viral replication. NS1 expressed in the ER lumen induced ER perinuclear aggregation with an ultrastructure resembling that of the replication compartment. Data from model membrane system indicated that the membrane-binding and membrane-remodeling properties of NS1 depend on its hydrophobic insertion into the membrane. These findings demonstrate that NS1 plays a crucial role in flavivirus replication compartment formation by remodeling the ER structure.

[4] USA (NY): antenatal infection

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Objective:
To evaluate whether antenatal Zika virus infection is associated with risk of having a small-for-gestational-age (SGA) neonate, risk of preterm birth, and lower mean birth weight of term neonates.

Methods:
For this retrospective observational study, we linked birth record data for women who delivered liveborn singleton neonates in New York City in 2016 to data for pregnant women with Zika virus infection reported to the New York City Health Department. We restricted the analysis to nonsmoking, nonwhite women and adjusted for maternal characteristics. Among women with antenatal Zika virus infection, we used modified Poisson regression to assess risks of having an SGA neonate and of delivering preterm, and linear regression to assess the association of infection with mean birth weight of term neonates.

Results:
Of 116 034 deliveries of singleton neonates in New York City in 2016, 251 (0.2%) were to women with antenatal Zika virus infection. A higher percentage of women with Zika virus infection delivered an SGA neonate compared with those without (11.2% vs 5.8%; adjusted relative risk [RR] 1.8; 95% CI 1.3-2.6). There was no difference in preterm birth prevalence for women with and without Zika virus infection (adjusted RR 1.0; 95% CI 0.69-1.6). Mean birth weight of term neonates born to women with Zika virus infection was 47 g less (95% I -105 to 11 g); this difference was not statistically significant in crude or adjusted analyses.

Conclusion:
For a cohort of New York City women, antenatal Zika virus infection was associated with an increased risk of having an SGA neonate, but not preterm birth or lower mean birth weight of term neonates. This supports a putative association between Zika virus infection during pregnancy and SGA.

[5] Maternal nutrition and CZS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy is associated with a spectrum of developmental impairments known as congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). The prevalence of this syndrome varies across ZIKV endemic regions, suggesting that its occurrence could depend on cofactors. Here, we evaluate the relevance of protein malnutrition for the emergence of CZS. Epidemiological data from the ZIKV outbreak in the Americas suggest a relationship between undernutrition and cases of microcephaly. To experimentally examine this relationship, we use immunocompetent pregnant mice, which were subjected to protein malnutrition and infected with a Brazilian ZIKV strain. We found that the combination of protein restriction and ZIKV infection leads to severe alterations of placental structure and embryonic body growth, with offspring displaying a reduction in neurogenesis and postnatal brain size. RNA-seq analysis reveals gene expression deregulation required for brain development in infected low-protein progeny. These results suggest that maternal protein malnutrition increases susceptibility to CZS.

[It would be interesting to see if protein restriction of Zika virus infected non-human primates has the same severe alteration of placental structure. If it does, it would be worthwhile to see if women who are protein malnourished are more prone to having CZS infants than women who are not. This mouse model suggests that a study of the nutritional status of pregnant women in areas of Zika virus transmission would be worthwhile. - Mod.TY]
