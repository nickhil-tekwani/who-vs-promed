Russia: 2 Fatal Human Rabies Cases in Chechnya
----------------------------------------------
2 fatal cases of rabies have been registered in the Shali district of Chechnya.
The 1st victim was born in 1989 and was a resident of Shali city. The 2nd was a
child born in 2000, a resident of Noviye Atagi village. Both were bitten by
stray dogs.
Both were admitted to the city hospital, where their wounds were cleansed and
they received anti-tetanus [sic] vaccine, however these measures did not save
their lives. [Tetanus vaccine protects against tetanus from dog-bites but does
not protect against rabies. - Mod.JW]
A team, headed by the deputy chief of Shali area administration, has been
organized to identify and eliminate the focus of infection.
According to Usam Bakayev, Chief Epidemiologist of the Ministry of Health of
the Chechnya Republic, the epidemiological situation in Chechnya is quite
alarming. According to a statement from him, in July 2004 3 fatal cases of
[human] rabies were recorded in the Nadterechniy rayon.ï¿½
"We are trying to liquidate infection", he assured the media. [How? By
vaccinating or shooting stray dogs? - Mod.JW]

[Chechnya is located in the south of the European part of Russia, in the
central part of the northern slope of the Caucasus Range. The population of the
Republic numbered 862 000 inhabitants in an 1997 census. The main city is
Grozny with a population of 210 000 inhabitants - Mods.NP/CP]
[Provision of post-exposure prophylaxis would seem to be the immediate
priority, followed by vaccination of the domestic dog population. - Mod.CP]
