Rabies kills 9 children in Huambo
---------------------------------
At least 9 children aged between 5 and 7 years died in the province of
Huambo, in the past 9 months as a result of bites from suspected rabid
dogs, compared with only 15 cases recorded previously the region.

Speaking on Friday [7 Oct 2011] to the press, the Provincial Director
of the Department of Veterinary Services in Huambo, Teresa Berta,
revealed that the process of vaccination campaign against rabies
continues in order to immunize more than 30 000 animals including
dogs, cats and monkeys. The official expressed concern over the
increase in deaths from bites by suspected rabid dogs, mainly in the
municipalities of Huambo, Tchicala-Tcholohanga, Caala and
Londuimbali.

[It is unclear from the statement by the Director of Veterinary
Services how the vaccination of dogs, cats and monkeys is being
managed. Is oral recombinant rabies vaccine in bait being employed, or
does the campaign depend on capture and immunisation of domestic
animals?

The number of human fatalities is alarming and suggests that
post-exposure prophylaxis is not readily available for children in
Huambo province, and that free-ranging dogs are the main source of the
virus in the province.
