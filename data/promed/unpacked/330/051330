A female patient, who has been undergoing treatment at the Shifa
International Hospital after being suspected as a patient with
Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), has been confirmed positive
for the infection by the National Institute of Health (NIH).

The female patient who belongs to Village Toot, Dhoke Golguppa of
Tehsil Pindigheb, Attock [district, Punjab province] was brought to
the Holy Family Hospital [HFH], Rawalpindi, on 14 Sep 2010 with
high-grade fever and continued, uncontrolled nasal and throat
bleeding, while bleeding from her skin and rectum was also reported.
The patient, aged 35, had earlier undergone treatment at a private
hospital in her native town for 2 days, but her fever did not subside.

The HFH, after suspecting the female patient to be a case of CCHF,
sent her blood sample to the NIH, Islamabad, which declared the
patient positive for the infection on Mon 20 Sep 2010. "At HFH, blood
transfusions were administered to the patient, but she was not
improving significantly," said the patient's brother while talking to
The News on Tue 21 Sep 2010. "One of our acquaintances advised us to
take her to Shifa International Hospital." He added that they took
the patient to Shifa International Hospital on 16 Sep 2010, where she
is now improving. "We have gone beyond our limits and have spent
nearly Rs 0.2 million [USD 2350] so far on treatment of the patient,
who has 2 daughters and 2 sons."

The mortality rate for hemorrhagic fevers [such as CCHF] ranges from
50 to 90 per cent. Persons with [such infections] experience
headache, high fever, muscle pain and vomiting along with internal
and external bleeding. According to the NIH guidelines, CCHF is
caused by a nairovirus (family _Bunyaviridae_) transmitted to humans
by the bite of _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or by direct contact with blood
of an infected animal or human. CCHF was 1st described in Crimea in
1944 and identified in 1956 in the Congo. Nearly 300 confirmed cases
of CCHF have so far been reported in Pakistan from 1976 to 2003. The
disease was 1st reported in Pakistan in 1976, but the number of cases
has shown a dramatic rise since 2000.

The News has learnt that the victim, who has been undergoing
treatment in the Intensive Care unit of Shifa International Hospital
in strict isolation, is improving. When she was taken to Shifa
International Hospital, she was bleeding from the nose, mouth and
rectum and had bruises on her skin. Her haemoglobin level had dropped
to 5 from 14. At Shifa hospital, she has been given blood and
platelets along with treatment, and now she is improving, said Fateh
Khan. He said, however, that treatment costs from Rs 30 000 to Rs 35
000 [USD 350-400] per day, and the family is not in a position of
retaining treatment at Shifa Hospital. "We want to shift the patient
to some public sector hospital like the Pakistan Institute of Medical
Sciences (PIMS), Islamabad, but it seems difficult, keeping in view
the condition of the patient" [At the time of this report, the
funding of the patient's further treatment had not been resolved. - Mod.CP].

CCHF is a highly infectious disease. It is relevant that nearly 7
years back, a female doctor of Holy Family Hospital died after
developing CCHF while treating a CCHF patient. Earlier, some 3
decades back, a renowned health professional in the city also died of
the infection while trying to treat a CCHF patient.

[The circumstances whereby the patient became infected are not
stated, but she resided in a rural area of Pakistan and could have
been exposed to infected ticks or had contact with the blood of
infected animals. Further information on the background to this case
and the outcome of her treatment would be welcomed.
