CDC confirms hantavirus killed Ellensburg officer
-------------------------------------------------
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has
confirmed that an Ellensburg, Washington, police sergeant died from [a]
hantavirus [infection].

Local health officials are still investigating how the officer may have
contracted the virus. The officer's death was the 2nd hantavirus infection
in Washington in August [2008] and the 1st death this year [2008]. State
health officials say a Bellingham resident whose name has not been released
was also treated for [a] hantavirus [infection].

The virus spreads through contact with mouse saliva, urine or droppings. On
average, 1 to 5 cases of the virus are reported in Washington annually. Of
35 confirmed state cases since 1993, 11 people have died.

There is still no information about which hantavirus was involved in this
case, although Sin Nombre virus is the most probable etiological agent. A
