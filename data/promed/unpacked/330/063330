There is a major epidemic of the mosquito-borne chikungunya virus in Tonga, with more than 10 000 people affected. It's the 1st time Tonga has seen an outbreak of the virus, which causes acute fever and joint pain.

[The interview from Radio Australia follows]:
Presenter: Catherine Graue
Speaker: Dr Siale Akau'ola, director, Ministry of Health, Tonga

AKAU'OLA: It's a major outbreak, as you have rightly mentioned; this is the 1st time for Tonga to have chikungunya in the country. It has been going on for at least a month now, but I think we feel that we are at its peak now. I think we are plateauing off, and we are hopeful that it will start to go down within the coming few weeks.

GRAUE: Now health authorities across the Pacific have warned about such an outbreak with chikungunya, but also dengue fever increasing incidence rates in recent months. Is that what you believe this has come from elsewhere in the region?

AKAU'OLA: Yes, absolutely. As you've probably heard, there are outbreaks in other Pacific Islands, and I believe this will the 1st in the South Pacific area. So with the frequent trips between islands, I'm sure it must have come from one of the other islands.

GRAUE: And you say that it's probably at its peak at the moment, so it [has] spread quite [a bit], I understand. Is it causing any serious concerns that obviously leave patients with acute fever and joint pain, but no deaths from chikungunya [virus infections] at this stage?

AKAU'OLA: Yes, that's what we believe. Actually, we have 2 deaths, 2 children who died, but we believe they were from dengue fever, because we had confirmed a handful of cases positive for dengue a couple of weeks ago, and the clinical presentations of those 2 kids were more towards dengue hemorrhagic fever rather than chikungunya. So with the thousands of people who have been presenting with chikungunya-like illnesses, we feel that we also have dengue, but at a much lower level.

GRAUE: Are you concerned, though, about the potential for that? We've seen particularly Fiji really experiencing and struggling with extremely high numbers of people fronting with dengue fever.

AKAU'OLA: Absolutely, we assuming, although we have confirmed a few cases with quick laboratory testing, it needs to be referred to an overseas referral laboratory for serology testing. So it has been referred. We're still waiting for results.

Most of the tests done so far have been negative, but we're still sending some samples for dengue, although the only confirmed lab tests were for chikungunya.

GRAUE: Now with 3000 people at the moment known to have been affected by chikungunya, are you able to cope with this? I understand that you are seeking some help from the World Health Organisation to kind of manage the outbreak. What are you doing, and what more help do you require?

AKAU'OLA: Actually, it's more than 3000; I believe it's probably more than 10 000. I think it's a credit to our staff at the ANE in the various hospitals in the country. They've been flat out for the last couple of weeks. We have rotated some of our clinicians from other parts of the hospital into the ANE to look after these people, but as mentioned. I mean with 10 000 plus cases, 2 deaths. I think it's not too bad for us.

From our point of view, I think we are managing. As mentioned, I think we're quite hopeful with the epidemic at its peak.

I think one of the issues that kind of diverted our attention was the recovery; perhaps you heard that Ha'aapi and the central part of Tongatapu are still recovering from that hurricane, so some our efforts have been diverted to that island. But clearly with the quick spread, it means that the mosquitoes are still around, so we're trying to encourage people to do the cleanup, spray for the vector, and keep safe, sleep in mosquito nets so that they're not bitten by the mosquito.

GRAUE: So you are confident that you have both the required number and adequate number of medical staff and resources, medication, etc. to deal with what you are saying are quite huge numbers of people that are being affected by this virus?

AKAU'OLA: Oh yes, for the time being, we are fine. I think we are managing, although we are struggling a little bit, but we have asked for technical assistance from WHO; they have provided it for Ha'aapi, because they are the vulnerable group. They've provided a strengthening of surveillance for outbreaks and especially for vector-borne diseases, but for the main island, I think we are managing OK.

[ProMED thanks David Hawman for submitting this report. This report was also sent in by Corr.SB from HealthMap Alerts.

Chikungunya virus has been moving around the Pacific. The most recent ProMED report previously was from Yap in Micronesia, where over 1000 people were infected (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20140114.2171369).

In 2011, there were reports of chikungunya virus infections in New Caledonia. In that outbreak in New Caledonia (ProMED-mail archive no 20110511.1446), Dr. Myrielle Dupont-Rouzeyrol and colleagues stated: "In New Caledonia, the putative vector of CHIKV is _Aedes aegypti_ since _Ae. albopictus_ has never been described there. ... Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that this viral isolate belongs to the Asia lineage, which corroborates the Indonesian origin of the imported cases," (ProMED-mail archive no 20110226.0631).

However, this Tonga outbreak is the 1st report from the South Pacific. It would be interesting to know whether the genetic lineage of this Tonga chikungunya virus is similar to that of New Caledonia. The concern expressed by Dr Siale Akau'ola, Director, Ministry of Health, Tonga in the above interview about the virus being moved around the Pacific islands is on target.

Mod.CP provided a good summary of the virus and the disease it causes in the initial report (ProMED-mail archive no 20131114.2055640).

[2] New Caledonia ex Tonga

The government of New Caledonia announced today [15 Apr 2014] that a new imported case of chikungunya [fever] has been identified, considering that the virus has not circulated since last October [2013].

We thought we had a little respite from chikungunya [virus]. But the virus, transmitted by day only by the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_, was back in operation in New Caledonia after several months of calm since it had stopped since last October [2013].

This time, the 1st imported case of chikungunya in 2014 comes directly from Tonga. One should recognize that several epidemics are currently raging in the Pacific, including in Tonga, Papua New Guinea, or the Federated States of Micronesia.

This is the 3rd epidemic in New Caledonia, already hit by chikungunya in 2011 and in 2013, coming at that time from Indonesia.

The government of New Caledonia recommends that travelers returning from these countries protect themselves from bites through the daily use of effective repellents and report any headaches, joint pain or fever to their physician as soon as the 1st symptoms appear.

[It would not be surprising if chikungunya virus appears in other Pacific islands, or from islands where the virus is being transmitted currently to the mainland in the Americas. ProMED will appreciate receiving additional reports from New Caledonia if further cases appear there.
