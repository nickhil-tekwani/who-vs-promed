One more case of Congo virus [has been] reported in Karachi as a young boy was diagnosed with the disease after being admitted at a hospital in Nazimabad area, ARY News reported on Sunday [18 Aug 2019]. Doctors confirmed that the 17 year old boy, named as [QS] who is [a] resident of Sohrab Goth and worked at a dairy farm, was diagnosed with Congo virus during the initial medical examination tests.

It is pertinent to mention here that the 1st case of Congo virus was reported on [11 Feb 2019] in the metropolis as a woman, [TF], [who] had been brought to Jinnah Hospital in critical condition.

In 2018, at least 16 deaths were reported in Karachi from the life-threatening virus, and 41 patients -- mainly from Quetta, Balochistan -- were diagnosed with it.

Earlier on [25 Jul 2019], a Congo virus alert had been issued for the metropolis, stipulating precautionary instructions for all those people who visit cattle farms. The alert was issued by Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) to hospitals, directing the management to adopt special precautions for a Congo-affected patient. The letter of the KMC further asked hospitals to establish special wards for Congo patients, and run awareness campaigns about the virus through banners and posters.

The disease is caused when a tick attaches itself to the skin of cattle, and when that infected tick or animal comes in contact with people, the highly contagious virus is transmitted into the human body and the person falls ill. This disease has a 40% to 50% mortality rate. The initial symptoms of Congo fever include headache, high fever, rashes, back pain, joint pain, stomach pain and vomiting.

Precautions: people should wear light-colored and airy clothes while going to cattle farms. Use of mask and gloves is also recommended while touching animals.

A 70 year old man from District Naushehro Feroz died due to Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) at a private hospital in Karachi a couple of days back, while a 25 year old patient is battling for life at another private hospital of the city, health officials said on [Fri 16 Aug 2019].

"[GA], 70, a resident of District Naushehro Feroz, Sindh died at Liaquat National Hospital Karachi within 4 hours of his arrival at the private hospital due to complications of Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) on [13 Aug 2019]," an official of the Sindh health department told The News.

The official maintained that with the death of the elderly man, the number of deaths due to the deadly tickborne disease had risen to 10 in the current year [2019] so far. He added that 4 of the deaths occurred in the first 2 weeks of August 2019 due to increased interaction between humans and cattle on the occasion of Eid-ul-Azha.

Officials said another person, aged 25 and identified as [SA], a resident of North Nazimabad, was battling for life at the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, after he tested positive for the fever. They said the young man had visited the cattle market on a number of occasions prior to Eid-ul-Azha for buying a cow and might have contracted the disease after coming into contact with an animal having deadly ticks attached to its body.

"The patient was admitted to the health facility on [14 Aug 2019], and he has been undergoing treatment for the deadly viral disease at the moment," the officials said. Health department officials maintained that, so far, 18 patients had tested positive for CCHF in Karachi, of whom 10 succumbed to the complications of the disease, while 8 managed to survive.

Experts say CCHF is a lethal viral infection that is transmitted to humans from animals, especially cattle and livestock. Patients are kept in isolation wards to prevent other patients, doctors and paramedics from contracting the viral infection. Mortality is around 40%, especially when patients are brought late to tertiary-care health facilities.

Three people -- a 15 year old boy from the Malir area of Karachi, [FI], [ZS], a 29 year old resident of Organi Town, and a 68 year old person, [HDM] -- died back to back in Karachi last week due to CCHF after their interaction with sacrificial animals on the eve of Eid-ul Azha.

Officials of the health department said they had established a surveillance system and isolation wards at all tertiary hospitals and district levels, and they were also providing health awareness about personal protective equipment, ribavirin and other medication to clinicians.

"Capacity-building of healthcare workers in terms of surveillance, diagnosis and case management is also being done while we are conducting health education campaigns and media campaigns in Karachi and other parts of Sindh," an official of the department said, adding that they had distributed infection prevention and control material to slaughterhouses.

The health department officials further said illegal slaughterhouses might be shut down by public health officials to prevent workers from contracting the lethal disease.

A patient suspected to have Congo fever passed away at Quetta's Fatima Jinnah Hospital on Tuesday [20 Aug 2019]. The patient, identified as 19 year old [AS] from Satellite Town, was brought to the hospital in a deteriorating state. His blood samples were sent to Karachi for investigation. However, he passed away before the results came.

According to Dr Sadiq, the Congo ward in-charge at Fatima Jinnah General and Chest Hospital, there is one woman currently admitted on suspicion of the disease. The doctor added that the woman has shown no outward signs of the fever.

A report published earlier in the day stated that the death toll of the disease in the country had reached 13.

[The last report mentions a suspected case of CCHF who subsequently died, and the laboratory confirmation is still pending. No history of contact with animals is mentioned though. Balochistan province of Pakistan is endemic for CCHF, and many cases travel to neighboring Sindh province for diagnosis and treatment.

In absence of an effective vaccine, taking measures to prevent exposure to the virus is the key to preventing tick-to-human, animal-to-human, and human-to-human transmission in the community. WHO recommendations to prevent CCHF are available at http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs208/en/. - Mod.UBA
