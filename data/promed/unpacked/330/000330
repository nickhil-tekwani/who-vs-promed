Six people died from malaria and 2643 positive cases were recorded in the Zambezi region this year [2020].

Regional health director Agnes Mwillima told The Namibian they monitor malaria cases weekly and during the same time last year [2019] they had only recorded 261 positive cases and one death. This is an indication that the cases have increased drastically, she said.

"The cause of the increase in malaria cases might be because the climate in the region is conducive for mosquitoes to breed throughout the year.

"Recent studies have also shown that mosquitoes are biting people outdoors too. The most affected people are agricultural workers, cattle herders, nomadic communities, and those sleeping in open structures," she explained.

Mwillima urged community members to protect themselves by using mosquito repellents, wearing long sleeved shirts, and covering their lower-limbs while outside and also allow the indoor residual spraying teams access to their houses.

The World Malaria report released yesterday has indicated that there were 229 million cases of malaria in 2019 compared to 228 million cases in 2018. The estimated number of malaria deaths in the world stood at 409 000 in 2019, compared with 405 000 in 2018.

The WHO African Region continues to carry a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden. In 2019, the region experienced 94% of all malaria cases and deaths. In the same year, 6 countries accounted for approximately half of all malaria deaths worldwide: Nigeria (23%), the Democratic Republic of Congo (11%), Tanzania (5%), Burkina Faso, Mozambique, and Niger (4%) each.

Children under 5 years of age are the most vulnerable group affected by malaria; in 2019 they accounted for 67% (274 000) of all malaria deaths worldwide.

[According to the WHO World Malaria Report 2020 (https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240015791) there is no malaria in the majority of the country. Cases are located mainly in the northern provinces of Kwambo and Zambesi (both the previous Caprivi Strip) bordering Angola. In the Zambesi region, the annual incidence was 10-50 cases per 1000 population (Annex 2A, p. 146). The coverage with insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) is not provided. Namibia reported 39 800 suspected cases in 2010, 209 000 in 2015, and 313 000 in 2019. Diagnostics is mainly performed by rapid diagnostic tests, of which 295 367 were done in 2019 with 3416 being positive. The same year, 511 microscopies were performed, with 301 found positive (Annex 3, p. 223). - Mod.EP
