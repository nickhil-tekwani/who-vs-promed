Abstract
Background
Despite the known circulation of West Nile virus (WNV) and Usutu virus (USUV) in Slovakia, no formal entomological surveillance programme has been established there thus far.

Aim
To conduct contemporaneous surveillance of WNV and USUV in different areas of Slovakia and to assess the geographical spread of these viruses through mosquito vectors. The 1st autochthonous human WNV infection in the country is also described.

Methods
Mosquitoes were trapped in 4 Slovak territorial units in 2018 and 2019. Species were characterised morphologically and mosquito pools screened for WNV and USUV by real-time reverse-transcription PCRs. In pools with any of the 2 viruses detected, presence of [_Culex] pipiens_ complex group mosquitoes was verified using molecular approaches.

Results
Altogether, 421 pools containing in total 4508 mosquitoes were screened. [Of these,] 3 pools tested positive for WNV and 16 for USUV. USUV was more prevalent than WNV, with a broader spectrum of vectors, and was detected over a longer period (June-October vs August for WNV). The main vectors of both viruses were _Culex pipiens_ sensu lato. Importantly, WNV and USUV were identified in a highly urbanised area of Bratislava city, Slovakia's capital city. Moreover, in early September 2019, a patient, who had been bitten by mosquitoes in southwestern Slovakia and who had not travelled abroad, was laboratory confirmed with WNV infection.

Conclusion
The entomological survey results and case report increase current understanding of the WNV and USUV situation in Slovakia. They underline the importance of vector surveillance to assess public health risks posed by these viruses.

[It is not surprising that both Usutu and West Niles viruses have been found in their mosquito vectors in Slovakia. There have been sporadic cases of Usutu virus infection in humans and wild birds in a wide geographic area in Central and southern Europe (https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/ese.14.50.19446-en).

Seroprevalence studies and retrospective investigations in Italy suggested that the prevalence of USUV infection in humans could be higher than WNV infection (estimated to range between 0.3% and 3%) in areas where both viruses co-circulate (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jmv.25230).

Interestingly, more Usutu virus isolates were made in mosquitoes in the above study than West Nile virus isolates. Both USUV and WNV are flaviruses. Since both viruses were detected, the above report underscores the need to be able to differentiate Usutu virus from WNV in any human cases that might occur. - Mod.TY
