Seven women in western England may have been infected with the human form
of mad cow disease (new variant Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease, nvCJD) while
giving birth, but it is wrong to warn them because they would only "worry,"
a regional health authority said on Monday.
Instruments used last year in a Caesarean section on a woman who was later
found to be suffering from nvCJD, were repeatedly reused after the October
birth. It is now believed the germ [prion agent can survive the
sterilization of surgical instruments.
The woman's baby has since been found to suffer from a neurological
condition, sparking fears she may be the first British child to inherit the
illness from its mother.
"They (the instruments) had been used 7 times," West Midlands Director of
Health Dr. Rod Griffiths told BBC radio. "We know who the patients are, but
no (we haven't got in touch with them) because ethically it's not at all
clear whether that's the right thing to do," he said. Any risk was
"vanishingly small."
Griffiths said the fact there was as yet no clear proof CJD could survive
sterilization on the instruments -- used between 26 October 1999 and 29
January 2000 -- meant it would be irresponsible to warn the women who may
potentially have contracted it.
"If...I say to you, you may have been exposed to a germ, we don't know
whether there was any left on the kit or not, it might be enough to give
you the disease it might not, because we've no idea what the effective dose
is," he said, "It doesn't seem to me to be the sensible thing to do."
"Once I've told you, you can forget getting life insurance and you can
worry about it for the rest of your life. Of course it may never affect you
at all," he added.
While the hospital has not been named for legal reasons, Griffiths said
General Practitioners (GPs) in the West Midlands had been told they can
tell patients who fear they have been infected as long as they ask first.
"I don't want to tell people unless they ask, because if they ask it's a
quite different game. But if I go out and give the bad news it ruins their
lives, when it need not," he said.
Scientists say nvCJD is caused by eating meat from cows infected with the
fatal brain-wasting illness bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad
cow disease.
Statistics show 9 people died last year from the nvCJD, which occurs when a
brain protein called a prion changes and folds in an unusual way.
