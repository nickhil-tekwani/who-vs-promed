[1] White mold - Ohio

Major white mold outbreak in Ohio soybeans
------------------------------------------
Rainy weather and cooler-than-normal summer temperatures have
resulted in a white mold outbreak in soybeans throughout parts of
Ohio. It's the 1st major outbreak of the disease in the state in
nearly a decade.

Anne Dorrance, Ohio State University, said that the disease is
affecting soybean fields mainly throughout southern and northeast
Ohio -- areas of the state that have been receiving the most
consistent rainfall. The good news is that it takes a lot of disease
to affect yields.

"Studies out of Iowa State have shown that it takes about 10 percent
infection, heavily scattered throughout a field, before you begin
seeing a yield reduction," said Dorrance. "Right now, the infection
is just in pockets throughout fields. If we start seeing infection in
50 out of 100 plants, then we may be looking at upwards of 20 percent
to 25 percent yield loss."

For producers facing fields with visible symptoms, little can be done
to stop the infection. Specialists do not recommend applying fungicides.

[2] Root and stem rots, sudden death syndrome - Ohio

The Southwest Corn Growers Field day was a great event. One of the
big topics being discussed by everyone was the fact there was a lot
of soybean disease showing up, especially in areas that have gotten
lots of rain the past month.

According to Anne Dorrance, Ohio State University Plant Pathologist,
sclerotinia stem rot [white mold], early season sudden death
syndrome, brown stem rot, phytophthora root and stem rot, and
diaporthe stem canker are all making early appearances throughout Ohio.

For all of these diseases soil drainage is playing a role in how
severe the disease is but also choosing varieties with high levels of
resistance will greatly reduce losses.

On [15 Aug 2009], soybean rust was reported in 9 new counties in
Mississippi, all in commercial soybean fields. Soybean rust could no
longer be detected in Texas. On [13 Aug 2009], soybean rust was
reported in Tensas County, Louisiana on soybean, and in Suwannee
County, Florida on kudzu [an alternative host]. In 2009, soybean rust
has been found in 7 states and 54 counties in United States, and in 2
states and 5 municipalities in Mexico.

[White mold, or sclerotinia stem rot, of soybean is caused by
_Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_. This fungus is one of the most
nonspecific and successful of plant pathogens with around 400 known
hosts. Symptoms vary on different hosts. White mold has progressed
from a sporadic disease to an annual threat to soybean production in the US.

Sudden death syndrome (SDS) of soybean is caused in North America by
the fungus _Fusarium virguliforme_ with reported yield losses of more
than 80 percent, depending on variety and timing of infection.

Phytophthora root and stem rot of soybean is caused by _Phytophthora
sojae_, and brown stem rot by _Cadophora gregata_ (previously
_Phialophora gregata_).

Stem cankers (including Northern and Southern stem canker) are caused
by different varieties of the fungus _Diaporthe phaseolorum_ and have
been widely recognised as an important disease of soybeans causing high losses.

Asian rust (also called soybean rust, leaf rust) is caused by the
fungus _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ and can result in yield losses of
soybean crops of up to 70 percent.
