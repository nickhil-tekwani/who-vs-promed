We have an epidemic in our hospital [in Delhi] and we have no clue as to
the causative organism. Since October [1997] we have noticed an outbreak of
arthritis in newborns who are underweight (1.5 - 2.0 kg ). Most have been
in the nursery for some time - 13 days to 40 days. All have received IV
fluids and antibiotics during their stay and have had symptoms of gastric
intolerance. Of these 18 definite cases of arthritis have been seen so
far. The joints involved have been hip and knee joints.
Some have been aspirated, while some have been operated and the aspirate
has not shown any growth on routine culture. Some have, however, shown slow
growing _Candida_ sp. in aspirate and in blood culture. Some have also
grown _Staphylococcus aureus_ on repeat cultures. Most have responded to
vancomycin and amphotericin B. One child died.
When the initial outbreak was noticed we closed down the nursery,
fumigated, and did all measures to disinfect the place and also took
cultures from all staff personnel entering the nursery. Once the epidemic
seemed under control we reopened the nursery. For one or two weeks
everything seemed fine, then we started getting cases again. This time the
difference was that some doctors also started with symptoms of effusion in
knee joints. So far 4 doctors and 2 staff nurses have been affected. All
have some joint related symptom or effusion.
No one is sure how to link all the cases to one organism and no one is sure
about what is the solution.
Do you think you could talk to or pass this information to some colleague
of yours who might be interested in the problem. If you want I can send you
details of all the cases.
All of us are worried because so far we do not know the aetiology. What do
you think? I shall appreciate an early reply.
