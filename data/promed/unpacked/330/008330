Although there is no equivalent sugar cane variety available, Co 0238, which increased the average yield by 33% in Uttar Pradesh, is likely to be phased out due to a new strain of red rot in the state. Co 0238 covered 82% of cane area in UP. Some processing mills already achieved as much as 40% replacement with Co 0118 in the current sowing season by persuading farmers.

Triveni sugar producers aim to ramp up their diversification with a varietal substitution programme to reduce dependence on Co 0238 and mitigate risks to farmers. They are focussing on propagation of Co 0118, Co 98014, CoLk 94184, and CoJ 85; new varieties like Co 15023 and CoS 13235 are being explored.

A former director of the Tamil Nadu sugar cane breeding institute suggests that continuation of Co 0238 for a few more years may be possible under strict disease management practices, particularly in areas where red rot threat is minimal, until good alternative varieties become available.

[Red rot disease of sugar cane is caused by the fungus _Colletotrichum falcatum_ (previously _Glomerella tucumanensis_). It is one of the oldest known diseases of the crop occurring in most cane-growing countries but continues to be a threat in a number of regions. Early symptoms are difficult to recognise; they may include discolouration, red streaks on midribs, leaf lesions, drooping of young leaves, and withering of stalks. Symptoms expand until all stalks of the plant die; they collapse within 4 to 8 days. Affected stalks show an internal dull red discolouration interrupted by occasional white patches characteristic of the disease; they may also contain large cavities. Seed pieces may rot completely. Symptoms are highly variable depending on the host variety and environmental conditions. In tolerant varieties, the infection remains largely confined to the internodes.

Several pathogenic strains of the fungus have been reported from many countries. Climatic factors affect both the spread and severity of red rot. The disease is favoured by excessive soil moisture, drought, and low temperatures. In addition, the nutritional state of the host may affect fungal growth. The pathogen can be spread by wind, rain, irrigation water, infected planting material, and crop debris. Spores may survive in the soil to infect planted seed pieces. Hosts other than sugar cane are not considered important inoculum sources.

Disease management may include use of clean planting material, phytosanitation, and cultural methods. Quarantine measures must be applied to prevent movement of infected cane setts to new areas. Hot water or fungicide treatments can be applied to setts before planting, but foliar fungicides have proven ineffective. The use of resistant varieties is the most effective method of control. Host factors determining resistance to red rot are not fully understood, but breeding programmes using intergeneric and interspecific crosses of _Saccharum_ spp. are being used to develop economically viable red-rot-resistant or tolerant varieties. Research on biocontrol agents is also being undertaken.

In India, red rot has caused extensive damage in the past and was responsible for the elimination of many elite sugar cane varieties. Co 0238 was developed by ICAR (Indian Council of Agricultural Research) and has been rated as 'moderately resistant' to prevalent races of _C. falcatum_, based on experimental trials. It is being praised as the 'wonder variety' due to increased cane yield and higher sugar content of crops. The variety is currently widely grown in several Indian states.

The fungus has also been reported as a cause of anthracnose of maize, and it can also affect sorghum.
