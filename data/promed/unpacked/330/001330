Farmers warned of new aggressive potato blight
----------------------------------------------
Irish scientists have warned farmers to be on alert for a new
aggressive strain of potato blight called "Pink 6".

Stephen Kildea of Teagasc, the [national] agriculture and food
development authority, said the new strain could not be properly
controlled by some existing chemicals on the market. "The new strain
has been previously found in potato crops in Donegal but so far this
year [200], despite a number of blight warnings from the
Meteorological Service, there have been no reports of it," he said.
Mr Kildea said scientists here did not yet know where it had come
from but were more interested in where it was going to spread.

He predicted there could be less blight in Ireland this year [2010]
because of the dryer weather. "Our best advice to farmers is to keep
spraying as blight can be kept in check that way but when it is
impossible to spray because of wet weather, major problems arise," he
said.

[Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus-like organism
_Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 percent crop loss. The
pathogen can also affect tomato and some other solanaceous crops. PLB
is spread by plant material (including potato seed tubers), wind, and
water. Disease management generally relies on fungicide treatments of
seed tubers and crops. Seed tuber certification schemes have been set
up in many countries and are an important part of PLB management.
Considerable variation in aggressiveness between different pathogen
strains has been observed, but more virulent strains are emerging
frequently.

Where both A1 and A2 mating types of the pathogen are present,
reproduction occurs sexually as well as asexually increasing the
chances of strains with additional fungicide resistances and
increased yield losses to develop. A new particularly aggressive A2
strain (Blue 13) with resistances to some widely used fungicides is
spreading in the UK (ProMED-mail post 20090406.1332), and has
recently been reported from Ireland (ProMED-mail post 20100212.0505).
Pink 6 is an A1 strain which seems to have emerged in the UK in 2009.

It has been reported that regional differences in pathogen population
diversity no longer exist in Europe where strains like A2-Blue13 and
A1-Pink6 are now dominating. Clean planting stock and management
strategies for fungicide resistance of the pathogen are considered
vital to control PLB outbreaks in the future.
