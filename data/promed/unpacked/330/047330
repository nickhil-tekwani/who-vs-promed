I have heard rumours of this being seen in northern Kenya (Samburu area) in
an occasional animal in the past two years. These rumours have not been
substantiated by sightings by veterinarians or KWS [Kenya Wildlife Service
personnel to my knowledge. I will ask Daphne Sheldrick and a colleague at
KWS Veterinary Services about this sometime next week...

Regarding the above condition, this is the first time we are hearing of it.
I and a colleague interested in wildlife research visited the Department
of Wildlife Chief Research Officer as soon as I received your message. He
had no knowledge of the condition so far but he is going to the field in an
area neighbouring Namibia and Botswana and will look out for this
condition. We also feel that especially the lower Zambezi area should show
the condition whether it is of infectious or plant toxic origin as the
elephants cross to and from between Zimbabwe and Zambia and the plant life
is similar.
We wish we had the resources to make a quick check ourselves! I will keep
you posted should we receive any useful information from our colleagues in
Wildlife.

Has any thought been put into the area of toxic poisoning from infectious
against such as botulinum toxin? Just a possibility that should be
considered since the toxin is known to cause paralysis.

[I am always reluctant to double guess guys in the field, especially when
they have been working on a condition for a number of years. Could some of
our Zimbabwe members share their knowledge of this condition with us? If it
is due to a selenium deficiency, why is only the trunk apparently affected?
Surely in "white muscle" disease the whole-body striated musculature is
affected? There should be parallel observations in grazing wild ruminants
in affected areas, though predators will cull them efficiently. Has a
similar condition been noted in nearby traditional or commercial livestock
herds? - Mod.MHJ
