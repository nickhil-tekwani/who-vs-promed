[Lumpy skin disease (LSD) has been known to be endemic in Egypt for decades. "In May 1988, LSD was recognized clinically in the Suez governorate of Egypt, where it was thought to have arrived at the local quarantine station with cattle imported from Africa. The disease spread locally in the summer of 1988 and apparently overwintered with little or no manifestation of clinical disease. It reappeared in the summer of 1989 and, in a period of 5 to 6 months, spread to 22 of the 26 governorates of Egypt. A rapid reaction to the problem led to the vaccination of nearly 2 million cattle with a sheep pox vaccine. Morbidity in this epizootic was low, being 2 percent of the whole cattle population. Approximately 1449 animals died" (see FAO's http://tinyurl.com/o3xud59 and commentary on ProMED-mail archive number 20131026.2021627).

Egypt has applied its mass annual LSD vaccinations policy, in bovines, continuously since then. Probably, Egypt's later immediate LSD notifications are submitted when exacerbations of the (otherwise low gear, quiescent) disease occur.

According to the information provided by OIE's WAHID database, the disease has been reported by Egypt as "infection/infestation in one or more zones" in their 2012 annual report (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Animalsituation) and in their last 6-monthly report (January to June 2013) (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist).

Information obtained from OIE's WAHID database indicates that in their latest 6-month report, Egypt reported one outbreak in April 2013 located in Shamal Sina governorate. During 2012, 2 outbreaks were reported in Dumyat governorate (one in August and the other in October; http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail).

The following information was obtained from an FAO document called "Emergence of lumpy skin disease in the Eastern Mediterranean Basin countries." EMPRES WATCH, Vol. 29, November 2013. Rome. http://www.fao.org/docrep/019/aq706e/aq706e.pdf:

"LSD was 1st reported in Africa, where it crippled the production potential of cattle and compromised vulnerable livelihoods on the continent. LSD moved beyond Africa in 1989 when Israel confirmed its 1st LSD outbreak. In subsequent years Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Yemen and the West Bank also reported LSD incursion. Lebanon and Jordan joined LSD affected countries in 2012 and 2013, and most recently Turkey reported the disease in October 2013 [Turkey has reported 5 outbreaks since October 2013 - Mod.CRD].

"There is a risk that LSD will (or has already) become endemic in some countries in the Middle East. Although LSD has not been reported in the Syrian Arab Republic -- most likely due to the current armed conflict -- the disease probably travelled through the Syrian Arab Republic to Turkey. LSD may also be in Iraq [Iraq officially reported 12 outbreaks of the disease to the OIE in November 2013; see ProMED-mail archive number 20131128.2079065 - Mod.CRD]. Furthermore, the situation raises concerns that the disease may continue spreading: i) north and west from Turkey into Europe and the Caucasus; and ii) east to Central and South Asia.

"LSD shows significant potential for major socio-economic impacts should it continue spreading: i) throughout newly affected countries; and ii) into their LSD free neighbours. This is especially alarming given the area's substantial livestock population. Turkey maintains over 11.3 million head of cattle. Iraq, Lebanon and the Syrian Arab Republic maintain 2.8 million head, and the Islamic Republic of Iran maintains for approximately 8.5 million head. Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia combined maintain 4 million head. At-risk countries include the Russian Federation to the north, and Bulgaria and Greece to the west. This is in line with the spread of other significant transboundary animal diseases (e.g., African swine fever, foot-and-mouth disease, sheep pox and goat pox) in the region. Moreover, capripoxviruses could be considered emerging disease threats because of global climate change and alterations to the trade patterns of animals and animal products."
