2000/028 Studies on the epidemiology of tomato yellow leaf curl begomovirus
in Spain
Tomato yellow leaf curl begomovirus (TYLCV - EPPO A2 quarantine pest) was
first reported in Spain in 1992 (EPPO RS 93/026). Since then, it has spread
to the main vegetable-producing regions of southern and south-eastern Spain
where it is a limiting factor for tomato production during summer and
autumn (up to 100% losses can be reached). So far, TYLCV-Sr isolates were
involved in outbreaks, but more recently in the same regions, abnormally
severe outbreaks are observed and are associated with TYLCV-Is. Studies
have been carried out on the possible factors responsible for this
displacement: competition between TYLCV-Sr and TYLCV-Is in tomato plants,
transmission by local biotypes (B and Q) of _Bemisia tabaci_, and presence
in weeds or other crops. Results showed that there is apparently no
competition between TYLCV-Sr and TYLCV-Is in tomato plants. TYLCV-Is is
more efficiently transmitted by the local biotypes of _B. tabaci_ than
TYLCV-Sr. Concerning weeds, both types of isolates are rarely found in wild
plants growing around tomato fields. But _Datura stramonium_ and _Solanum
nigrum_ may be possible reservoirs for the virus. More significantly, it
was found that bean (_Phaseolus vulgaris_) is a host plant of TYLCV-Is but
not of TYLCV-Sr. Bean is often cultivated between tomato crops and can act
as a reservoir for the virus. The authors concluded that the cultivation of
bean which can host TYLCV-Is between tomato crops and the efficiency of
local biotypes of _B. tabaci_ to transmit TYLCV-Is are probably two factors
responsible for the displacement of TYLCV-Sr by TYLCV-Is in Spain.

[According to the authors, the Sr isolate of TYLCV was originally isolated
from tomato in Sardinia, Italy and has subsequently spread to southern and
southeastern Spain. Tomato production in the region constitutes 30% of the
total production in Spain. This report is a excellent example of the
dynamics involved in viral competition in field conditions. - Mod.DH
