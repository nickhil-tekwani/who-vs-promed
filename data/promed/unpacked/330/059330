Ref: West Nile virus vector _Culex modestus_ established in southern England.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Authors: N. Golding, MA Nunn, JM Medlock, BPurse, AGC Vaux and SM Schafer.

Abstract (provisional)
Background: The risk posed to the United Kingdom by West Nile virus (WNV) has previously been considered low, due to the absence or scarcity of the main _Culex_ sp. bridge vectors. The mosquito _Culex modestus_ is widespread in southern Europe, where it acts as the principal bridge vector of WNV. This species was not previously thought to be present in the United Kingdom.

Findings: Mosquito larval surveys carried out in 2010 identified substantial populations of _Cx. modestus_ at 2 sites in marshland in southeast England. Host-seeking-adult traps placed at a 3rd site indicate that the relative seasonal abundance of _Cx. modestus_ peaks in early August. DNA barcoding of these specimens from the United Kingdom and material from southern France confirmed the morphological identification.

Conclusions: _Cx. modestus_ appears to be established in the North Kent Marshes, possibly as the result of a recent introduction. The addition of this species to the United Kingdom's mosquito fauna may increase the risk posed to the United Kingdom by WNV.

[ProMED thanks Nick Golding for sending in the above scientific report on the finding of _Cx. modestus_ in the UK. Scientific literature is preferable to reports in the popular press. As the authors point out, the role of this species as a bridge vector may prove to be a key factor in transmission of WN virus in the UK should the virus become established there. The authors finding of _Cx modestus_ was in 2010. It would be of interest to know if the geographic range of this species has changed since that time.
