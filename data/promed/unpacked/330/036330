The WA Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) is working with growers to contain the spread of potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd), following confirmation of 2 recent detections in tomato and capsicum crops north of Perth. DPIRD is undertaking delimiting surveillance in production areas.

Growers have been asked to monitor their crops. Symptoms could easily be confused with nutrient deficiency or toxicity, spray damage, insect damage, or plant viruses. DPIRD is assisting growers to implement meticulous on-farm hygiene measures to limit spread. PSTVd has been detected in tomato, capsicum, and chilli since 2007, but so far never in potato growing areas of the State.

[_Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (PSTVd; type member of genus _Pospiviroid_) is an important pathogen of solanaceous crops. Yield losses can be up to 65 percent in potato and up to 50 percent in tomato. Symptoms in potato may include spindly shoots; stunting of plants; severely distorted tubers (spindles); and delayed sprouting. In tomatoes, symptoms include leaf chlorosis and distortion; shortening of internodes; stunting of plants; and absence of flowers. Capsicum plants often display only mild symptoms. Solanaceous ornamentals are often symptomless. All varieties of tomato and potato appear to be susceptible, but mild strains causing latent infections in some host cultivars exist.

PSTVd is seed transmitted in potato and tomato at a rate of up to 100 percent, depending on the host cultivar. Tomato seed is considered an international quarantine risk (ProMED post 20140122.2222560); the viroid was shown to be present in the embryo and endosperm (see link below). Spread occurs also via infected plants or vegetative plant parts (potato seed tubers, tomato explants, tissue cultures), pollen, mechanical means, and plant-to-plant contact. PSTVd is exceptionally stable and can persist in dried sap or plant residue for considerable time. Only in the presence of _Potato leafroll virus_ can PSTVd also be transmitted by an aphid vector (_Myzus persicae_). The presence of PSTVd (and other pospiviroids) in symptomless weedy hosts has been reported from several areas, including Australia (ProMED post 20161206.4678068).

Due to the multiple potential transmission routes and the large number of host species, both epidemiology and control of PSTVd are complicated. Disease management relies mainly on removal of infected plants and other sources of inoculum, phytosanitary procedures, as well as use of certified PSTVd-free seed and other planting material. Pospiviroids are considered an emerging phytosanitary threat worldwide because of their potential effects on a number of very important crops and the high risk of incursions via commercial imports.
