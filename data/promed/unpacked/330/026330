In case you are conducting a poll regarding the European Communicable
Disease Network, I am in favor of a central agency similar to the CDC. I
have no doubt that the national surveillance centers are doing their
best, but I am not convinced that a) standards are equally high in all
member states and that b) communication between all these agencies can
be rapid and effective. What is needed is not just another institution
on the Union level, but a strong central European agency that can
provide comprehensive surveillance, and coordinate cross-border
outbreaks of communicable diseases that become more frequent and likely
as the integration of the common market progresses and the Union
expands.
Regrettably a decision of the European Parliament -- elected by all
European citizens -- does not mean anything if the comission does not
give their placet. If there are opposing views, the Commission
usually wins the day...
