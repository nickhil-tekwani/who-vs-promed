Summary
-------
A total of 132 new confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported in the week to 1 Mar [2015], an increase on the previous week (99 new cases). Liberia reported no new confirmed cases this week, the 1st time since the week of 26 May 2014. The weekly number of confirmed cases has increased in both Sierra Leone and Guinea. Transmission remains widespread in Sierra Leone, which reported new confirmed cases in 8 districts during the week to 1 Mar [2015]. In Guinea, Forecariah and Conakry reported a marked increase in case numbers compared with the previous week.

Guinea reported 51 new confirmed cases in the week to 1 Mar [2015], compared with 35 cases the previous week. Cases continue to arise from unknown sources with only 49 per cent of cases arising from registered contacts. Seven prefectures reported new cases, with the largest number of new confirmed cases reported from 3 neighbouring western prefectures: Conakry (17 cases), Coyah (5 cases), and Forecariah (23 cases). Macenta also reported 2 new confirmed cases, a district that has not reported a confirmed case for 4 weeks. Low levels of transmission continue in the eastern prefecture of Lola (1 new case), bordering Cote d'Ivoire.

Sierra Leone reported 81 new confirmed cases from 8 districts in the week to 1 Mar [2015]. A previously reported cluster of cases in the Aberdeen fishing community of the capital, Freetown, has seeded outbreaks in other districts, notably Bombali which reported 22 new confirmed cases. There were 26 new confirmed cases in Freetown and 16 new cases in Port Loko over the same period.

Liberia has reported no new confirmed cases this week. Contacts from the last known chain of transmission, in the St Paul's Bridge district of Monrovia, are being monitored. In the week to 1 Mar [2015], 277 samples were tested for EVD nationwide, no new test results were positive.

The number of confirmed EVD deaths occurring in the community in Guinea and Sierra Leone remains high, suggesting that the need for early isolation and treatment is not yet understood, accepted or acted upon. In Guinea in the week to 1 Mar [2015] over half (53 per cent: 17 out of 32) of reported confirmed deaths occurred in the community, an increase from 42 per cent the previous week (9 out of 21). In Sierra Leone, 16 per cent of confirmed EVD deaths occurred in the community in the week to 1 Mar [2015], compared with 21 per cent the previous week.

Unsafe burials continue to occur, with 16 reports of unsafe burials in both Guinea and Sierra Leone, respectively, during the weeks to 1 Mar [2015] and to 22 Feb [2015].

Laboratories in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone processed 270, 277 and 1531 samples, respectively, in the week to 1 Mar [2015].

Mindful of the risk of cross border transmission, delegations from Guinea, Mali and Senegal met on 25-26 Feb 2015 and agreed to strengthen cross-border cooperation in case management (including the sharing of laboratory resources), community-based surveillance, risk communication and information sharing, and screening at border crossings.

In the week to 1 Mar [2015], 1 new health worker infection was reported Guinea, bringing the total of health worker infections reported across the 3 most-affected countries since the start of the outbreak to 839, with 491 deaths.

[4] Liberia: Last Ebola patient
Date: Wed 4 Mar 2015

http://en.starafrica.com/news/liberia-to-discharge-last-ebola-patient-thursday.html


Liberia to discharge last Ebola patient Thursday [5 Mar 2015]
-------------------------------------------------------------
The head of Liberia's Ebola Incident Management System [IMS], assistant health minister Tolbert Nyenswah, has said that Liberia will on Thursday [5 Mar 2015] discharge its last Ebola patient from the Chinese Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) in the Paynesville suburb of Monrovia. "There will be a discharge ceremony of the lone live confirmed Ebola case..." Nyenswah told reporters at the Information Ministry daily Ebola press conference in Monrovia on Wednesday [4 Mar 2015].

According to Nyenswah, the discharge of the lone case would indicate that the country is gradually moving towards its countdown that could possibly signify the end of the crisis, if citizens resist complacency. Quoting statistics from the IMS, he, however, noted that there are 102 Ebola contacts across the country, with nearly all of the ETUs nearing emptiness.

"13 of the 15 counties have completed more than 2 of their incubation periods without a single trace of any new case, which means, that most political sub-divisions of the county, except Montserrado and Margibi Counties, have gone 28 days or more without a confirmed case," he said. He stressed the need for residents to resist complacency as the country is close to defeating the Ebola virus disease. "We must remain on the alert by complying with all of the preventive measures," he said.

Last week, deputy information minister Isaac Jackson disclosed that there were 2 confirmed cases of Ebola in the 19 ETUs across the country.

[According to the New York Times [edited], 5 Mar 2015 (http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/06/world/africa/last-ebola-patient-in-liberia-beatrice-yardolo-discharged-from-treatment.html), "If no new cases emerge, the epidemic in Liberia will be considered over officially on 4 Apr [2015], or 42 days after the last known infection. The 42-day marker is twice the longest incubation period for Ebola, 21 days.

Liberia has suffered the highest number of deaths during the epidemic, with 4117 recorded victims, according to the World Health Organization. More than 9800 people have died in total." ...

Nonetheless, an exciting and hopeful headline; but for Liberia to remain free of Ebola, it will require vigilance and strict adherence to proper public health protocol as well as maintenance of the health care system, both challenging. - Mod.LK]

[5] Ebola blood test problems

Ebola blood test problems using wrong tubes in Guinea centers
-------------------------------------------------------------
There were mistakes in dealing with Ebola blood tests in Jan-Feb 2015 which led to the release of at least 4 positive patients, 2 of whom later died, Guinea's anti-Ebola coordinator and other health officials said. The mistakes occurred at 2 different treatment centers. Dr Sakoba Keita, Guinea's anti-Ebola coordinator, confirmed the mistake had occurred. "This error was detected and the order was immediately given to withdraw the [incorrect] tubes and to find the patients in order to test them again," Keita said.

Health officials said the mistakes occurred when staff placed blood samples in the wrong test tubes, and took place in Coyah, where Cuban medics are supporting a government-run center, and in Conakry, where medical charity Medicins Sans Frontieres [MSF] runs a center at the Donka hospital complex. Patients were discharged from the centers in western Guinea, one of the biggest remaining Ebola hot spots in the region, after the test results came back negative. At least 6 patients were later found to be Ebola-positive when further tests were carried out, and 2 of them died, the officials said.

MSF said it discovered on 6 Feb 2015 that blood samples from 43 patients taken from its Donka center had been placed in tubes containing the blood-thinning drug heparin in green tubes, while those for Ebola are in red or purple. The World Health Organization (WHO) said staff taking samples had run out of the correct tubes and instead used the heparin tubes, without reporting it. When discovered, "MSF took the incident very seriously and immediately replaced the tubes and opened an investigation," said Rosa Crestani, MSF's emergency program coordinator. 3 of those tested were later discovered to be Ebola positive and recovered, she said. No one who came in contact with the trio contracted the disease.

At the Coyah center, Guinea's busiest Ebola facility, which is also supported by staff from the African Union, the samples of 9 people were accidentally placed in tubes also containing heparin, said another health official. The official said that after initially being found to be Ebola negative, 3 of the 9 later tested positive, of whom 2 died. No further cases among contacts of the 3 Ebola patients released from Coyah have been identified, he said.

WHO said the mistake was not detected in the Donka laboratory, which tested both sets of samples, where technicians had received a "huge amount of samples". The laboratory is run by Guinea and supported by the Institut Pasteur de Dakar -- a foundation created in 2009 by a statute signed between Senegal and France's Institut Pasteur.

Dr Dan Kelly, founder of the Wellbody Alliance providing healthcare in Sierra Leone, said it was not unusual for centers to run out of test tubes, but procedures existed. "Stock outs happen. What you are supposed to do is wait for the right colored tubes to arrive," he said. ...

[A number of questions are raised by this report, such as why did the labs themselves not immediately notify the director/manager of the lab as well as the testing lab to let them know there was a misuse of the tubes as indicated by color code? And one would have thought the testing lab would have noticed the problem since the tubes they received to test for virus would have had the wrong color. What brought this oversight to attention? It is concerning that similar problems occurred in 2 labs.

If the issue was a shortage of the correct tubes, it is important that this supply chain problem is addressed immediately. It is equally important that laboratory personnel be trained to understand the correct use of the different tubes, so that when there is a shortage, appropriate action is taken. - Roger Feldman & Mod.LK]

Trials involve the identification of a newly diagnosed Ebola case and the tracing of all his/her contacts. Contacts are vaccinated if they give their consent. "The objectives of the trial are 2-fold: to assess if the vaccine protects the contacts who were vaccinated and if vaccinating the contacts will create a buffer -- or ring -- of protected individuals around the index case to prevent further spread of the infection"]

[In September 2014, a 44-year-old physician, while working in a Sierra Leone Ebola treatment facility, experienced a needle-stick injury; 43 hours later, after flying to the United States, he received an experimental Ebola vaccine (rVSV-ZEBOV). Subsequently, he did not develop Ebola, and there were strong immune responses after the vaccination]

[See L Lai; R Davey; A Beck, et al. Emergency postexposure vaccination with vesicular stomatitis virus-vectored Ebola vaccine after needlestick. JAMA. 2015; Preliminary communication. http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2195001: "The vaccine used was rVSV-ZEBOV, also called VSV [Delta] G-ZEBOV, (Public Health Agency Canada and NewLink Genetics Inc), a replicating, attenuated, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (serotype Indiana) whose surface glycoprotein gene was replaced by the Zaire Ebola virus glycoprotein gene (Kikwit strain). This vaccine has entered a clinical trial for the prevention of Ebola in West Africa -- see item above regarding rVSV-ZEBOV."

From http://www.doctorslounge.com/index.php/news/pb/53534 Health Net [edited]: Thomas Geisbert, PhD, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, and also the author of an editorial accompanying the new study, said that "the article reinforces the need for fast-acting single-injection preventive vaccines to control and manage outbreaks." If proven safe and effective in humans, the single-dose shot "would have great utility for things like vaccinating health care workers and 1st responders, say, right before you put them on an airplane to go into the hot zone." -- Mod.LK]
