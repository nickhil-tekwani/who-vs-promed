The Philadelphia Health Department is investigating a 4th possible
case of meningococcal meningitis at the University of Pennsylvania,
officials said Monday [16 Feb 2009]. The university would not comment
on the investigation but did release a statement saying the 3
students who were hospitalized with the disease last week are showing
improvement.

Two additional students who are from the same social circle were
hospitalized over the weekend with flu-like symptoms. Their
conditions are also improving, officials said. Doctors have been
closely monitoring their conditions to ensure they did not in fact
contract meningitis.

Penn officials believe the disease has been spread through the
university's Greek [fraternity/sorority] system. As a precaution, all
on and off-campus parties were shut down this past weekend.

Meningitis is spread through close, prolonged contact like sharing
toothbrushes or utensils, kissing, or sexual contact. University
officials say it is not uncommon for more than one case to pop up on
campuses. Early symptoms of infection include fever, severe headache,
stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, rash, lethargy and sensitivity to bright light.

More than 2100 students have received preventive antibiotics since
the 1st report of a meningitis outbreak was released.

[Each year, up to 3000 people in the USA develop meningococcal
disease. The annual incidence generally ranges from 0.5 to 1.1 cases
per 100 000. The incidence peaks in late winter and early spring.
Most cases are sporadic; less than 2 percent occur in outbreaks
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5407a1.htm>.
Outbreaks tend to occur in semi-closed communities, such military
recruit camps, college dormitories, schools, and day-care centers.
Community-based outbreaks in towns, cities, and counties may also
occur among persons who are not close contacts of each other and who
do not share a common affiliation.

Although the incidence of meningococcal disease in general is highest
in children less than 2 years of age
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5407a1.htm>,
more cases arise among the 5 to 19-year-old group during epidemics
than during non-epidemic periods. Currently, serogroups B, C and Y
cause the majority of infections in the USA; serogroup A is rare in
the USA, and W-135 causes a very small proportion of infections;
serogroup B is the most common serogroup in infants, while serogroup
Y causes the majority of cases in those aged 65 years and older
<http://www.nfid.org/pdf/meningitis/FINALChanging_Epidemiology_of_Meningococcal_Disease.pdf>.

An outbreak of meningococcal disease is defined as the occurrence of
3 or more confirmed or probable cases during a period of less than or
equal to 3 months, resulting in a primary disease attack rate of at
least 10 cases per 100 000 persons, which is approximately 10-fold
greater than the normal occurrence
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm>.

Chemoprophylaxis is given to appropriate contacts whose risk for
acquiring meningococcal disease is 500-800 times greater than among
the total population
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm>.
Close contacts of patients are household members, day care center
contacts, and persons directly exposed to the patient's oral
secretions. Administering chemoprophylaxis to persons who are not
close contacts of patients usually is not recommended. Neither
oropharyngeal nor nasopharyngeal cultures for _N. meningitidis_ are
useful in deciding who should receive chemoprophylaxis.

In an outbreak, the population at risk should be vaccinated with the
meningococcal vaccine appropriate for the serogroup causing the
outbreak as soon as possible after an outbreak has been declared
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm>.
Mass immunization campaigns are labor-intensive and costly.
Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccines do not protect very young
children, do not protect unvaccinated population groups, and only
provide protection for up to 3 years. As a result, repetitive
meningitis outbreak responses can deplete a country's scarce health
care finances with comparably little impact. A preventive strategy
based on conjugate vaccines could have a significantly larger and
more enduring impact.

A quadrivalent A, C, Y and W-135 conjugate vaccine was licensed in
the United States in January 2005. The meningococcal conjugate
vaccines induce a T-cell-dependent response, resulting in an improved
immune response in infants, providing long-lasting immunity and
preventing nasopharyngeal carriage of _N. meningitidis_ and thus
reducing bacterial transmission of this microorganism
<http://www.nfid.org/pdf/publications/meningococcalepid.pdf>.
The CDC in any case now recommends the meningococcal conjugate
vaccination for college students and any persons aged 11 to 18 years,
military recruits, microbiologists who are routinely exposed to
isolates of _N. meningitidis_, persons who travel to Mecca during the
annual Hajj or to countries in which _N. meningitidis_ is
hyperendemic or epidemic, particularly if contact with the local
population will be prolonged, persons who have terminal complement
component deficiencies, and persons who have anatomic or functional asplenia

Dr. Caroline Johnson, Director of the Division of Disease Control for
the Philadelphia Department of Public Health reports: That the 3
culture-confirmed cases were caused by meningococcus serogroup B, for
which there is no effective vaccine; that the 3 isolates were
ciprofloxacin-susceptible (ciprofloxacin-resistant meningococcal
isolates have been reported in the past, see ProMED-mail Meningitis,
meningococcal, drug resistant - USA (MN, ND) 20080215.0601); and that
the population at risk is the student population of about 3000
involved in the campus fraternity/sorority system. The attack rate of
3 confirmed cases and one case that is probable in 3000 is over the
outbreak threshold of 10 per 100 000. Dr. Johnson also reports that
the fraternity/sorority campus population was given preventive
ciprofloxacin and that 99 percent of University of Pennsylvania
students were vaccinated against meningococcal disease prior to
admission, but serogroup B disease, unfortunately, is not vaccine-preventable.
