The number of people infected with the potentially deadly _E. coli_ O157 bacterium has risen to 19, health experts have said. 2 people had to be hospitalized in July [2016] after being infected with the bacterium, which was linked to a cheese manufacturer in South Lanarkshire.

Health Protection Scotland said all 19 victims were recovering at home. The 1st cases were detected between 2 and 15 Jul 2016 and were linked to Dunsyre blue cheese, which is made with unpasteurized milk. Manufacturer Errington Cheese, based in Carnwath, recalled about 180 kg of the cheese as a precaution.

Founder Humphrey Errington said: "As a responsible company, we took the voluntary decision to recall the 2 batches of cheese which they were concerned about."

[Although not mentioned in this post, at least 2 cases have been reported in England as well, as noted in a previous post.

Unpasteurized milk and other dairy products are well known sources of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, either O157 or non-O157, as well as a large selection of other pathogenic microbes including zoonotic organisms such as:

_Brucella abortus_,
_Brucella melitensis_,
_Mycobacterium bovis_,
_Salmonella_ species,
_Listeria monocytogenes_,
_Campylobacter_ species,
_Yersinia_ species, and
_Coxiella burnetii_.

Pathogenic microbes also include non-zoonotic organisms such as:
_Streptococcus pyogenes_,
_Salmonella_ Typhi,
_Corynebacterium diphtheriae_,
_Shigella_ species,
_Salmonella_ Paratyphi A,
_Salmonella_ Paratyphi B,
enterotoxins from _Staphylococcus aureus_, and
hepatitis A.
