Suspected Human Case of Mad Cow Disease in Russia
-------------------------------------------------
MURMANSK: The suspected death here of a 29-year-old man from
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) could be the first Russian case linked to
mad cow disease, medical authorities said on Monday 4 Dec 2000. The victim,
a merchant seaman from Murmansk in northern Russia, [may have] died from
the human form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), also known as
[(new) variant CJD] or "mad cow disease", a senior medical official said.
The Murmansk Region's Chief Medical Officer, Andrei Cherniyev, stated that
"It is not the first case of CJD in Russia. This brain-wasting disease [is
not invariably associated with the consumption of beef carrying the BSE
agent]. But the [significance] of this particular case is the relative
youth of the victim, because the average age of people who have died from
[the sporadic or inherited forms of CJD] is much older." A spokesperson for
the Murmansk region's Epidemiological Centre, Svetlana Chemakina, also
cautioned that the victim's death did not necessarily signify that BSE had
infected Russian cattle herds. "Even if one accepts the hypothesis that
death was caused by eating contaminated food products, one would have to
take into account the fact the victim was a sailor and therefore could have
acquired the (new) variant form of CJD by consuming contaminated meat while
abroad." Both officials emphasized that it was impossible to confirm that
the death was linked to mad cow disease.
Russia's Ministry of Agriculture announced last week that it was monitoring
recent cases of BSE reported in Poland and Germany but had yet to make any
decision on banning beef imports from those countries. Russia has already
banned beef imports from Britain and Portugal, as well as from certain
parts of France and Ireland.

[This appears to be the first reference to the occurrence of BSE in cattle
in Poland. An earlier ProMED-mail post on 7 Nov 2000, BSE - Belgium: first
case (02), reported that the cow identified as Belgium's first case of "mad
cow" disease was used in a 1200-ton batch of animal feed, some of which has
been exported to Poland. However, since the average incubation period of
BSE in cattle is about 5 years, any current cases would be the result of
earlier exposure. - Mod.CP]
