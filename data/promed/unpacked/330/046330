A Comment on the Vector Status of _Culex sitiens_
-----------------------------------------------
I wish to respond to a statement in the ProMED-mail post entitled:
"Japanese encephalitis - China (Hong Kong) (04) 20041102.2972": "Noting
that there is concern about whether mangroves found at the seashore in the
area were a breeding ground of the Japanese encephalitis virus vector, Mr
Yuen said salted water is not the natural habitat for _Culex
tritaeniorhynchus_. "The recorded local _Culex_ species that breeds in
salted water is _Culex sitiens_, which is not a vector for transmission of
Japanese encephalitis," he said.
My response to this statement is as follows. _Culex sitiens_ definitely
should be considered to be a potential vector of Japanese encephalitis
virus. Isolates have been obtained from this species in Malaysia
(Vythilingam et al., 1994) and Northern Taiwan (Weng et al., 1999).
Malaysian and Australian _Cx. sitiens_ strains were able to transmit the
virus in laboratory-based vector competence experiments (Vythilingam et
al., 2002; van den Hurk et al., 2003). Furthermore, high rates of pig
feeding have been reported from _Cx. sitiens_ in Malaysia (Vythilingam et
al., 1994). Finally, _Cx. sitiens_ is a member of the _Cx. sitiens_
subgroup, which includes _Culex annulirostris_, the primary vector of
Japanese encephalitis virus in Australia (Mackenzie et al., 2002).

[As Dr van den Hurk says, _Culex sitiens_ is a salt water species. In
contrast, the larval habitats of _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_, the most
important vector of JE, are freshwater collections, this species being
extremely common in rice fields throughout much of Asia. It is not very
surprising that _Cx. sitiens_ is a potential vector of JE, as it has been
demonstrated that the virus can infect at least 25 mosquito species, most
being in the genus _Culex_, but also others in the genera _Aedes_,
_Mansonia_, _Armigeres_, and _Anopheles_. - Mod.MS]
