Russia: Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome, Sverdlovsk Region
---------------------------------------------------
In total, 125 cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS)
were registered in the Sverdlovsk region in 2004. The morbidity of
HFRS in 2004 was 2.63 percent among 100 000 inhabitants, 21 times
higher than 2003, and 8 times higher than the median level of
morbidity over a period of several years.
Cases of HFRS were registered in the city of Ekaterinburg and in 8
districts of the region. The Krasnoufimsky district was the most
[severely affected], with 97 cases of HFRS diagnosed, 50 times higher
than the average level of morbidity in the whole of the Sverdlovsk
region.
An epidemiological investigation established that about 30 percent of
all persons affected had drunk unboiled water, whereas the other 70
percent were infected from the environment, where wild animals are
the main source of infection. An increase in the number and activity
of small mammals suggests that the Sverdlovsk region will remain a
centre of HFRS.
