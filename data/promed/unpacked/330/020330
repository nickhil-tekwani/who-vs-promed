Six people have contracted bovine tuberculosis in an outbreak in Birmingham
which has killed one man. Three are thought to have picked up the infection
at a bar and nightclub, 2 had visited the same venue and one was acquainted
with others infected.
Most of those who were affected suffered from other diseases. The Health
Protection Agency (HPA) said measures were taken to halt the spread of the
infection and there was no continuing public health risk.
New DNA investigation techniques showed all 6 cases were linked either by
person-to-person spread or by being infected by a common source. The source
of the outbreak is thought to have been a man who drank untreated,
unpasteurized milk.
Professor Peter Hawkey, from the Regional Centre for Mycobacteriology at
Birmingham Heartlands Hospital which made the discovery, said the 6 were
connected by a "complex social web." All were young people, with an average
age of 32, and were known to go to nightclubs or pubs; 2 were found to be a
couple.
Prof Hawkey said most cases of TB are usually found in people in their 60s
and 70s but said people using pubs and clubs in the Birmingham area should
not be concerned.
"The risk is tiny," he said. "But the health message is that anyone who
experiences persistent weight loss with night sweats, tiredness and a cough
should seek medical attention as it is just possible they might have TB."
The last case was reported in February 2006 and it is thought the outbreak
is over, said BBC Midlands Today science and environment correspondent
David Gregory. The outbreak was first thought to be a blip in the TB
figures because the rate of infection was more than the amount expected for
cases of bovine tuberculosis.
The HPA investigation was launched after one case was reported in 2004, 4
in 2005 and one at the beginning of 2006. It said on average 3 cases a year
are reported in the West Midlands.

[This report confirms that DNA fingerprinting has linked the 6 cases
epidemiologically and gives the timing of diagnosis of each case, spread
over 3 calendar years. Despite the seemingly wide time spread of the
diagnoses, this is certainly consistent with exposure of each case to the
index case over a short period of time.
The timeline of events for the development of active tuberculosis, bovine
or otherwise, consists of:
1 - initial significant inhalational exposure to droplets containing viable
mycobacteria;
2 - over 6-8 weeks after exposure, replication of the organism at the
primary lung focus and silent spread to foci in other organs;
3 - at 6-8 weeks after exposure, development of competent cell-mediated
immunity (measurable as a positive tuberculin reaction) with granulomatous
inflammation to prevent further spread (latent tuberculosis infection, LTBI);
4 - at 1-2 years after exposure, about 5 per cent of this population
(assuming no cases with profound immunosuppression) with LTBI will develop
(reactivate) tuberculosis, usually in the lungs, within 2 years (the 6
cases here although the first might be the index case). Another 5 per cent
will develop active disease later in life. With HIV disease, exposed
individuals can reactivate as frequently as 10 per cent per year as
compared to 10 per cent per lifetime (Abter EIM, Schaening O, Barbour RL,
Lutwick LI. Tuberculosis in the adult. In: Lutwick LI (ed). Tuberculosis: a
clinical handbook. London: Chapman & Hall, 1995: pp54-101).
Therefore, based on these estimates in people without profound
immunosuppression, it is possible that as many as 100-120 people developed
latent bovine tuberculosis after exposure to the index case. Of these
people, 90 per cent will remain as latent infection but another 5-6 people
will reactivate later in their lives. If there is a significant number of
immuno-incompetent individuals, the number of reactivations could be much
higher. The outbreak, therefore, may well be far from over. - Mod.LL]
