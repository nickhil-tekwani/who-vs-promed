A total of 10 cases of meningococcal infection have been registered in
Kaliningrad oblast in the past 4 months. Rospotrebnadzor [Russian Federal
Agency for Protection of Customer Rights and Human Welfare] media services
have reported that there were half as many cases last year [2009] during
the same period of time.

All cases were children from Kaliningrad and Svetly, Zelenogradskiy,
Krasnoznamenskiy, and Gvardeyskiy rayons [rayon is a type of administrative
unit]. A 15 year old schoolgirl from Kaliningrad died from meningitis on 15
Apr 2010. Rospotrebnadzor reported that the cause of her death was severe
fulminating meningococcal infection and that infection control measures
have been taken.

[There are 2-20 000 meningococcal nasopharyngitis and carrier cases
(localized forms) for each case of generalized meningococcal infection.
This ratio is as high as 45-50 000 to one in big cities. The increase of
morbidity in generalized forms of meningococcal infection requires
serogroup A and B vaccination of all susceptible children, teenagers, and
adults. Children and teenagers from preschools, schools, and boarding
schools are at special risk. - Mod.NP

_Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of meningococcal disease, is
transmitted from person to person via droplets of respiratory secretions
mostly from asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers of the microorganism. It
is estimated that between 10 and 25 per cent of the population carry _N.
meningitidis_ at any given time, and the carriage rate may be much higher
in epidemic situations. Close and prolonged contact (such as kissing,
sneezing, and coughing on someone, living in close quarters or dormitories
(military recruits, students), sharing eating or drinking utensils, etc)
facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period for
meningococcal meningitis is 4 days, ranging between 2 and 10 days
(<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/>). Outbreaks tend to
occur in semi-closed communities, such military recruit camps, college
dormitories, schools, and day-care centers. Community-based outbreaks in
towns, cities, and counties may also occur among persons who are not close
contacts of each other and who do not share a common affiliation.

An outbreak of meningococcal disease is defined as the occurrence of 3 or
more confirmed or probable cases during a period of less than or equal to 3
months, resulting in a primary disease attack rate of at least 10 cases per
100 000 persons, which is about 10-20 times greater than the normal
occurrence (for calculation of attack rates see
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm>). Chemoprophylaxis
is given to appropriate contacts whose risk for acquiring meningococcal
disease is 500-800 times greater than among the total population
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm>). Close contacts
of patients are household members, day-care center contacts, and persons
directly exposed to the patient's oral secretions. Administering
chemoprophylaxis to persons who are not close contacts of patients usually
is not recommended. Neither oropharyngeal nor nasopharyngeal cultures for
_N. meningitidis_ are useful in deciding who should receive chemoprophylaxis.

In an outbreak, the population at risk should be vaccinated with the
meningococcal vaccine appropriate for the serogroup causing the outbreak as
soon as possible after an outbreak has been declared
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm>). Mass
immunization campaigns are labor-intensive and costly. Meningococcal
polysaccharide vaccines do not protect very young children, do not protect
unvaccinated population groups, and only provide protection for up to 3
years. As a result, repetitive meningitis outbreak responses can deplete a
country's scarce health care finances with comparably little impact.

A preventive strategy based on conjugate vaccines could have a
significantly larger and more enduring impact. A quadrivalent A, C, Y, and
W135 conjugate vaccine was licensed in the United States in January 2005.
The meningococcal conjugate vaccines induce a T-cell-dependent response,
resulting in an improved immune response in infants, providing long-lasting
immunity and preventing nasopharyngeal carriage of _N. meningitidis_ and
thus reducing bacterial transmission of this microorganism
(<http://www.nfid.org/pdf/publications/meningococcalepid.pdf>).

Kaliningrad Oblast, the northern part of the former East Prussia, is a
federal district of Russia situated between Poland and Lithuania on the
Baltic coast and is geographically separated from the rest of Russia. It
has a population of 955 281 (2002 census)
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaliningrad_Oblast>). The combined
population of Kaliningrad, Svetly, Zelenogradskiy, Krasnoznamenskiy, and
Gvardeyskiy rayons is about 500 000 (<http://www.statoids.com/yru.html>).
The attack rate of 10 cases in 500 000 people is below the outbreak
threshold for meningococcal disease of 10 per 100 000.
