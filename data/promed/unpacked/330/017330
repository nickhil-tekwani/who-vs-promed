The 2nd Congo virus case of the year [2014] recently surfaced in the city [Karachi, Sindh province]. Luckily, the patient is said to be in a stable condition, The Express Tribune learnt on Monday [8 Sep 2014].

The patient who is admitted in the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) is a 17-year-old student and a resident of Shah Faisal Colony.

The family, who could not afford the cost of private medical care, had taken the boy to a charitable hospital in Korangi in a critical condition. Sources said that the boy was referred to the JPMC as the administration had told the family that there was no bed available for him. The hospital administration had suspected that the boy was suffering from the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever and referred him to the JPMC on 4 Sep [2014].

The laboratory tests, which were sent to the Aga Khan University Hospital, confirmed on 6 Sep [2014] that the patient had contracted the Congo virus.

Weeks after the 1st case was reported in the city, the provincial health authorities have failed to take adequate measures to stop the virus from spreading.

The history of the latest patient shows that he used to play in a ground located near a cattle pen. The healthcare providers believe that the boy was infected during his visits to the cattle pen.

According to Dr Seemin Jamali, the joint executive director of the JPMC and the in-charge of its accidents and emergency ward, the boy was brought to the hospital in a very critical condition, adding that there was blood in his urine and vomit. "Yes, he is a positive Congo virus case," Dr Jamali confirmed to The Express Tribune. She said that the boy is being kept in the isolation ward, adding that all precautionary measures are being taken.

Despite the high mortality rate, Dr Jamali seemed confident that the boy will survive. "He is in stable condition and is gradually recovering," she added. This is the 1st case in one of the city's biggest health facilities where a patient with Congo virus is said to be in stable condition.

Earlier, a 24-year-old man, the city's 1st case of the year, died in a private hospital in the 4th week of August [2014]. Kashif was a resident of Gulberg town, Federal B Area, Union Council No. 1.

The man was a butcher by profession. The city's top health officials had convened meetings and claimed that they had issued warnings to slaughterhouses and cattle pen owners regarding the virus. They also claimed that all precautionary measures were being adopted so that more cases could be avoided.

Health officials of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation also conducted a survey of 2000 houses around he man's house to check for possible threats of the virus being present in the area.

Health care providers fear that the situation seems very critical as 2 cases have surfaced within 15 days and thousands of animals are being brought to the city every day.

[There have been sporadic cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in various parts of Pakistan this year (2014). CCHF virus is a tick-borne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_. The boy's exposure may have been via tick bite that could have occurred while he was near the cattle pens. The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities also occurs, which is why the above patient was placed in an isolation ward in the hospital. The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.
