Area gardeners asked to be vigilant against potato virus [fungus - Mod.JAD]
-----------------
In an effort to avoid another outbreak of late blight disease in Mat-Su
[Matanuska-Susitna valley area, in south-central Alaska], potato fields,
the state Division of Agriculture has asked home gardeners and commercial
growers to observe the late blight quarantines during the spring planting
season.
Late last summer, a series of blight infestations hit many Mat-Su fields,
destroying one farmer's entire crop and taking considerable portions of others.
Late blight is a wind-borne water mold that has been discovered 3 times in
Alaska since 1995. The disease first infects potato plant leaves and then
quickly works its way into the actual potatoes (tubers) and turns them into
a slimy mush. Late blight was responsible for the 19th century potato
famine in Ireland.
It is not known where the late blight came [during the summer of 2005], but
Division of Agriculture director Larry DeVilbiss said Friday that it likely
started from a virus strain carried by infected tomatoes.
DeVilbiss said growers can help the state avoid another outbreak by using
Alaska-grown certified seed potatoes, buying tomato plants grown in Alaska
from seed, and not planting potatoes purchased for consumption.
"By educating themselves and planting responsibly, Alaska growers can
prevent the spread of this disease," he stated in a press release.
Statewide, potatoes are a $3.5 million industry for Alaska, with about 7700
tons produced on about 840 acres. DeVilbiss said 3/4 of those potatoes are
grown in the Mat-Su area.
One concern of the state is the export market value of Alaska seed
potatoes. Up until summer 2005, Alaska potatoes had a fairly strong
reputation for being blight-free, which meant other states and countries
around the world were interested in using Alaska potatoes to combat blight
infestations.
DeVilbiss said he believes vigilance in monitoring future crops will help
maintain Alaska's reputation for clean potatoes.
"I don't think this will have a drastic effect as long as we can
demonstrate this is a disease that is still coming from the outside," he
said, while adding that right now it is still unknown as to where the most
recent outbreak originated.

[2] Potato late blight, low yields - Bangladesh

Potato production in Nilphamari in 2006 would be around half of 2005's
quantity and at least 30 per cent space in clod storages will remain empty,
sources said.
The production has been the lowest in 5 years due to massive attack by
'late blight' disease in plants, Agriculture Extension Department (AED)
officials said. The situation is the same in all the eight districts in
greater Rangpur and Dinajpur, they said.
The slump in production has already hit markets. The wholesale price is Tk
700- 800 [USD 10-12] per 84 kg bag against last year's Tk 350-300 [USD
4-5]. In the retain market, potato is sold at arong Tk 10 [USD 0.15] per kg
against Tk 4-5 [USD 0.07] last year. The prices will soar further, traders
and cold storage owners said.
The cold storage [facilities] are also facing [a] potato crisis. Immature
potatoes collected from lands are rotting.
Farmers cultivated potato on 16 495 hectors of land in Nilphamari, which is
1475 [hectares] more than that during 2005.
Immediately after sowing, farmers faced a severe blow when it rained
heavily in the later half of October. Farmers in most areas in Nilphamari
prepared lands again and sowed seeds. But when plants matured, it was late.
Most potato fields were attacked with 'late blight' a wild virus [fungus
-Mod.JAD] that destroys plants in 3-4 days.
AED Plant protection specialist Ahamed Reza in Nilphamari said as plants
turn yellowish and die within 3-4 days, most potatoes under the ground
remain immature. After collection, immature potatoes start rotting within
15 days and cannot be preserved.
AED officials said 2005's production of potato was around 14 tonnes per
hectare, which came down to around 7 tonnes in 2006.
Managing Director of Mukta Cold Storage in Jaldhaka, Sayed Ali, said at
least 30 per cent of his cold storage will remain empty this year as
farmers ad traders are not giving reservation orders. He said immature
potatoes collected from lands would rot in cold storage within a short time.

[The crop plant potato (_Solanum tuberosum_) develops symptoms of the
disease late blight when infected by the fungus _Phytophthora infestans_.
Late blight is the most important disease of potato in Bangladesh and it is
considered to be the major limiting factor to increasing potato production.
It occurs every year with varying intensities. Damage due to late blight is
frequently high in Bangladesh. This article notes that the most recent
season's losses (2005/2006) in one part of the country have been the worst
there for 5 years and yields appear to have approached only 50 percent of
what can be harvested in a normal year. Heavy rains in the later half of
October 2005 are considered a factor that could help explain the current
disease intensity. The other article describes the concerns about late
blight in Alaska, USA, a region where potatoes are grown for seed in the
general absence of the pathogen. The concern that an infestation in 2005
(note see also:) could lead to lo!
cal sources of inoculum which could threaten the Alaska seed potato
industry is at the heart of the article. Different problems in 2 parts of
the world are yet another reminder of how damaging this disease can be on a
worldwide basis.
