Health officials in New Mexico are worried about the spread of hepatitis A. "Currently we have 13 acute laboratory-confirmed cases of hepatitis A in Bernalillo County. The vast majority are in the city of Albuquerque," said Dr Chad Smelser, deputy state epidemiologist with the New Mexico Department of Health. And that's just in a 2-month span. That's a big concern considering New Mexico typically only sees about 10 cases of the liver infection a year.

"The high-risk factors for this outbreak are people who inject drugs, and the vast majority of those who have been found are homeless," Dr Smelser said. Because of that, doctors believe that means the numbers are likely higher. It also makes the virus much more difficult to control.

"Part of the reason is that these populations are difficult to get vaccinated, and the virus can be shed before you have symptoms, so you can spread it before you even know you're ill," Dr Smelser said. While most people will typically feel sick for a few weeks and recover without liver damage, those who are older or with other underlying illnesses can get very sick. "In fact, all 13 of our cases were hospitalized," he added.

That's why harm-reduction teams are out in full force right now, visiting homeless shelters and immunizing. "And the city of Albuquerque has even put handwashing stations out in areas where homeless people are known to congregate," Dr Smelser said. [Health officials] are hoping to stop the spread of hepatitis A before the virus gets out of hand. "We don't have an exact prediction, however, in other states and areas that have had similar outbreaks. Some of these outbreaks have gone on for quite some time," Dr Smelser said.

Reported cases of hepatitis A are spiking in southern Arizona. There were just 5 cases in 2017 in Pima County. This year, in 2018, health officials have seen 22 cases.

"Right now, we're very concerned, because we're seeing an increase in the number of cases in our homeless and our populations that use illicit drugs," Pima County health deputy director Paula Mandel said. "Someone is shedding the virus through their stool, and they go to the bathroom. They may not wash their hands very well, so then they go out, they touch an object, they prepare the food, they share a drink," said Mandel. "Then another person is exposed."

Washing hands is crucial in preventing infection. Officials said the number one line of defense is the hepatitis A vaccine. It is available for adults and children over the age of one.

"We're also trying to vaccinate that population that we feel is at high risk -- the homeless and illicit drug users -- by providing the vaccine to community partners and encouraging vaccinations at locations that are comfortable for those individuals," said Mandel.
