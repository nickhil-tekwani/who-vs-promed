At least 32 people have died since late August [2016] in an epidemic of Rift Valley fever in the western Niger region of Tahoua, the country's health ministry said [Thu 17 Nov 2016].

A ministry statement read on national radio said 230 people had been infected with the fever-causing viral disease that mainly affects animals but also humans, "unfortunately including 32 deaths."

The mortality rate had fallen from 50 percent 3 months ago to 14 percent due to a government information campaign urging people to bury animal carcasses and handle contaminated animals with care and avoid drinking raw milk.

Symptoms include fever, headaches, and stomach pain in people, while in livestock, common symptoms are fever and bleeding.

[The Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak continues in the Tahoua region. The case count has increased from 98 cases with 28 deaths on 10 Oct 2016 to 230 cases with 32 deaths reported above. Again, it seems odd that no RVF cases in livestock are mentioned in either the report above or in the previous post.

As mentioned earlier, Mod.CRD's excellent comment stated, "Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a peracute or acute zoonotic disease of domestic ruminants. The virus is confined to the African continent and Arabian Peninsula. It is caused by a single serotype of a mosquito-borne virus of the _Bunyaviridae_ family (genus _Phlebovirus_). The disease occurs in climatic conditions favouring the breeding of mosquito vectors and is characterised by abortion, neonatal mortality, and liver damage. The disease is most severe in sheep, goats, and cattle. Older non-pregnant animals, although susceptible to infection, are more resistant to clinical disease. There is considerable variation in the susceptibility to RVF of animals of different species. Camels usually have an inapparent infection with RVF virus (RVFV), but sudden mortality, neonatal mortality, and abortion occur and abortion rates can be as high as in cattle. Humans are susceptible to RVFV and are infected through contact with infected animal material (body fluids or tissues) or through bites from infected mosquitoes."
