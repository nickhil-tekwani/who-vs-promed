[African swine fever (ASF) is a serious viral disease of pigs reported
in sub-Saharan African countries; the disease is also present in
several other world regions. A detailed account of the disease is
given in the previous ProMED mail posting of 4 Dec 2008 (archive no.
20081204.3812).

According to the OIE report above, the last outbreak in Mbeya region
occurred in 2004, however in the country as a whole the disease has
also been reported in 2005 and 2008. The disease is of economic
importance to pig farmers in this particular part of the country,
hence its control is highly important.

The location of the outbreak can be seen on the map included in the
OIE report at the source URL above. The HealthMap/ProMED-mail
interactive map of Tanzania can be seen at

Authorities in Moyo District have banned transportation of pigs out of
the district following an outbreak of African swine fever. The
authorities have also banned the sale of pork in the district.
According to the acting district veterinary officer, Dr Richard Akule,
the ban is aimed at reducing further spread, especially from Southern
Sudan and also from neighbouring districts.

Dr Akule said some people have started drying the condemned meat in
some of the villages. "I know pigs are a source of livelihood to many
so others could not report such cases to us, we found others smoking
the condemned meat," he said. A farmer in Kendi village who has lost 5
of his pigs, says his revenue income would be reduced. "5 pigs are a
lot because piggery is my major source of income. I think government
should help us to vaccinate the animals," [he] said. So far, at least
150 pigs have reportedly died following the outbreak of the disease a
week ago.

The disease is ravaging 8 villages in Moyo Sub-county and Moyo Town
Council. African swine fever is a highly contagious disease that is
normally fatal especially in pigs. It is transmitted through direct
contact with infected animals. Symptoms of the disease include fever,
inactivity, and loss of appetite. The abdomen and ventral chest may
present blue and red discoloration.

Depression, loss of appetite, vomiting, and uncoordinated movement are
some of the signs and symptoms that infected pigs will show. Dr Akule
advised farmers to monitor their animals for symptoms and inform
authorities on time.

At the moment, the movement of pigs, pork, and other pig products
from, to, and within the district is prohibited until further notice.
Similar quarantine was imposed in the district in June this year
[2010] and only lifted after the disease burden had subsided.

[ProMED-mail is reposting from its regional list (ProMED-EAFR
Anglophone Africa)a report on African swine fever (ASF) in Tanzania.
At the same time, there is information on an outbreak of ASF in
Uganda. ASF outbreaks occur regularly in the countries surrounding
Tanzania. Since 2009, ASF has been reported to the OIE WAHID database
as occurring Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Democratic Republic of Congo,
Zambia, Burundi, and even Madagascar. So, with the exception of Kenya,
all the countries surrounding Tanzania have seen this disease
regularly. Of course, West Africa also suffers substantially from this
disease.

When the disease has the potential to be explosive and cause many
deaths in pigs and when pigs are a major economic sustaining force in
the community and the source of a good livelihood for individual
farmers, it is critically important to control the disease. Thus, a
regional approach to establishing prevalence, disease distribution,
and economic impact might in be a good 1st step in combating this
disease over the long haul. In the short term, early reporting to
authorities and compliance with stop movement order is critical to
control the difficult and ongoing impact of the virus. - Mod.PC]
