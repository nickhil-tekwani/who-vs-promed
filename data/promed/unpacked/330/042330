Influenza update 134 [20 May 2011]
----------------------------------
Summary
-------
- The influenza season is largely finished in the temperate countries
of the northern hemisphere with transmission now either undetectable
or at very low levels in most areas.

- A few tropical countries are experiencing low grade transmission
including the Dominican Republic, Venezuela (influenza A(H1N1)2009),
and Jamaica (influenza type B) in the Americas; and Rwanda (influenza
A(H3N2) and Madagascar (influenza type B) in Sub-Saharan Africa.

- The influenza season has not yet started in the temperate countries
of the southern hemisphere. Australia has reported a small increase in
reports of influenza-like illness, however actual detections of
influenza virus have decreased in most jurisdictions in recent weeks,
including in the northern tropical states.

- A summary review of the northern hemisphere 2010/11 winter
influenza season will be published in the World Health Organization's
Weekly Epidemiological Report on 26 May 2011.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
North America

Influenza activity in both USA and Canada has now largely returned to
baseline levels. Rates of influenza-like illness, reports of influenza
related deaths, and influenza related hospitalizations all continue to
decrease in both countries, though some localized activity persists in
the Canadian provinces of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. The percentage
of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza virus is low,
5 percent in Canada and less than 2 percent in the USA, and are
predominantly influenza type B.

Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East

Influenza activity across Europe and northern Africa has also
returned to very low levels. Consultations for influenza-like illness
(ILI) and acute respiratory infection (ARI) are at very low levels in
Europe and half of countries reported no influenza activity. Only 2
percent and 4 percent of respiratory samples tested positive for
influenza from sentinel ILI and severe acute respiratory infection
(SARI) cases, respectively, in Europe. Little or no influenza activity
is being detected in reporting countries of North Africa and the
Middle East. Of the small numbers of viruses being detected in Europe,
North Africa, and the Middle East, influenza type B is the most common
type.

[Eastern] Asia

No notable influenza activity is being reported from Mongolia,
northern China, the Republic of Korea, or Japan. Rates of ILI and
detections of influenza viruses are all quite low; 3 percent of all
outpatient visits were due to ILI in northern China, which is below
that observed in the previous 3 seasons. Most influenza viruses
detected in the area are influenza type B (all 12 viruses in northern
China and 60 percent of 415 viruses in Japan).

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
Very little influenza activity is being reported across the tropical
regions. In the Americas, the Dominican Republic has been reporting
low numbers of influenza A(H1N1)2009 for the last 5 weeks. Jamaica has
also experienced low numbers of persistent influenza type B
transmission for several weeks, though in both of these countries
numbers have recently decreased. Previously noted influenza
A(H1N1)2009 circulation in Venezuela peaked in late March [2011] and
has now returned to very low levels. Several countries in the tropical
areas of Central and South America are now reporting an increase of
respiratory infection activity related to respiratory syncytial virus
transmission. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the previously reported
transmission of influenza A(H1N1)2009 and influenza type B in Ghana
and Kenya is subsiding. Rwanda has experienced recent active
transmission of influenza A(H3N2) over the past 10 to 12 weeks and
Madagascar reports persisting transmission of primarily influenza type
B with fewer numbers of H3N2. In tropical areas of Asia, very low
numbers of influenza viruses are being reported with below baseline
rates of ILI, where these data are available.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
[Southern hemisphere circulation of influenza viruses (snapshot)
http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/2011_05_20_influenza_southern_hemisphere_circulation_main.pdf]

The influenza season has not yet started in the temperate countries
of the southern hemisphere. Australia, which had previously observed
higher than expected numbers of influenza virus detections, most
notably in the northern states of Queensland and the Northern
Territories, reports that detections of virus have been decreasing in
most jurisdictions in recent weeks. ILI reports in Australia have
increased slightly but are still low. The majority of virus detections
in Australia over the summer have been H3N2, though in the past one
week H1N1 (2009) and influenza type B have become relatively more
common.

Source of data
--------------
The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide
and publishes an update every 2 weeks. The updates are based on
available epidemiological and virological data sources, including
FluNet (reported by the Global Influenza Surveillance Network) and
influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member States.
Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and quality of
data available at the time when the update is developed.

The current situation remains that the northern hemisphere winter
influenza epidemic is now virtually over, and the southern hemisphere
epidemic has yet to begin. - Mod.CP]
