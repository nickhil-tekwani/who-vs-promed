Gastroenteritis Epidemic Hits ACT [Australian Capital Territory - Canberra]
---------------------------------
One woman has died and another 200 people have contracted gastroenteritis
in the worst epidemic of the illness in the ACT for 2 decades. ACT Health
stepped in to manage the epidemic late last week when 2 nursing homes
reported multiple cases. Those 2 homes, St Andrew's in Hughes and Morling
Lodge in Red Hill, were advised to ensure that there were no visitors to
their residents in an effort to contain the disease.
The woman who died was a resident at Morling Lodge in her eighties.
Canberra Hospital also has 2 wards affected, an oncology ward and a
geriatric ward. That outbreak has been contained. Elective surgery was
cancelled for last Friday and yesterday but is scheduled to go ahead today.
The Chief Health Officer for ACT Health, Dr Paul Dugdale, said his
organization immediately stepped in to examine hygiene procedures at the
institutions where the outbreaks began. The chief executive of Baptist
Community Services, New South Wales and ACT, which owns Morling Lodge, June
Heinrich, said the woman who died was already frail when she contracted the
disease. She also said staff at the nursing home had immediately
implemented changes recommended by ACT Health. Morling Lodge has been badly
affected, with 58 residents, out of a possible 90, and 42 staff members
contracting the disease. Gaps in staffing because of the epidemic had to be
filled by those already employed by the nursing home since agencies were
reluctant to send in casuals who risked being exposed to the virus.
The manager of St Andrew's, Stan Sismey, said 75 of the residents had
contracted the disease but most were now recovering and there were no new
cases yesterday.
Dr Dugdale said that Norwalk-like virus had been positively identified in
at least 2 cases. ACT Health has issued a warning that the epidemic might
spread to other hospitals, nursing homes, residential and day-care
facilities and to private homes.

[During 2002 Norwalk-like virus infection has been associated with
outbreaks of "winter vomiting illness " among staff and patients in
hospitals in the UK. This report suggests that a similar phenomenon may be
an accompaniment to winter in the southern hemisphere. - Mod.CP]
