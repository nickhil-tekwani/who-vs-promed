Ukraine will launch a comprehensive probe into reports in the German
media that traces of dioxin were found in Ukrainian corn exports to
Germany via Holland, a senior official said in Kiev on Tuesday [11 May 2010].

"Investigations would be carried out, despite the fact that Germany
has not yet made any formal charges," Ukrainian Agriculture minister
Mykola Prysyazhnyuk was quoted by the Interfax-Ukraine news agency as
saying at a news briefing. "There are only media reports, nothing
else, but we will initiate an investigation in any case," Prysyazhnyuk said.

According to Germany's international broadcaster Deutsche Welle,
millions of eggs were pulled from German Rewe and Lidl supermarket
chains for showing traces of dioxin, which had apparently originated
in the chicken fodder.

The German Consumer Rights Protection Association said Ukrainian
fodder corn had been supplied to farms in at least 9 German states.

Prysyazhnyuk said the Ukrainian government had already held a special
meeting to tackle the issue and that it "would take all necessary
steps to ensure the media allegations were dropped."

"We will conduct an investigation because this (allegation) affects
our country's image," Prysyazhnyuk added.

[One has to applaud the Ukrainian authorities for taking the media
reports seriously and performing a due-diligence investigation before
any charges are made.

The chemical name for dioxin is: 2,3,7,8- tetrachlorodibenzo para
dioxin (TCDD). The name 'dioxins' is often used for the family of
structurally and chemically related polychlorinated dibenzo para
dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs). Certain
dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) with similar toxic
properties are also included under the term "dioxins". Some 419 types
of dioxin-related compounds have been identified but only about 30 of
these are considered to have significant toxicity, with TCDD being
the most toxic.

Sources of dioxin contamination
------------------------------
Dioxins are mainly by products of industrial processes but can also
result from natural processes, such as volcanic eruptions and forest
fires. Dioxins are unwanted by products of a wide range of
manufacturing processes including smelting, chlorine bleaching of
paper pulp, and the manufacturing of some herbicides and pesticides.
In terms of dioxin release into the environment, waste incinerators
(solid waste and hospital waste) are often the worst culprits, due to
incomplete burning.

Although formation of dioxins is local, environmental distribution is
global. Dioxins are found throughout the world in practically all
media. The highest levels of these compounds are found in some soils,
sediments, and food, especially dairy products, meat, fish and
shellfish. Very low levels are found in plants, water, and air.

Extensive stores of PCB-based waste industrial oils, many with high
levels of PCDFs, exist throughout the world. Long-term storage and
improper disposal of this material may result in dioxin release into
the environment and the contamination of human and animal food
supplies. PCB-based waste is not easily disposed of without
contamination of the environment and human populations. Such material
needs to be treated as hazardous waste and are best destroyed by high
temperature incineration.

Given the location of the Ukraine and the eggs, one wonders how much
effect the recent volcano ash may have played a role in contaminating
a number of things.
