A local executive from Davao del Norte province in Mindanao region has called on the national government to help small holder banana growers to address the onslaught of Panama disease. The disease has reached alarming levels, forcing farmers to shift to maize. The situation is endangering the long-term viability of banana as high value and export commodity.

The banana industry in the province is on the brink of dying, because the problem has not yet been thoroughly addressed. The official asked the government to establish a research centre to study Panama disease.

[Panama disease of banana (PD, also called fungal or fusarium wilt) is caused by the soil-borne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ (previously f. sp. _cubense_). Symptoms include yellowing, wilting, and streaking of pseudostems; affected plants die rapidly. The pathogen is spread by infected planting material, mechanical means (including human and insect activities), soil, and water.

Disease management for PD is difficult and mostly relies on phytosanitation for pathogen exclusion. The fungus can survive in the soil for decades; consequently, crop rotation with non-hosts is not likely to control the disease effectively. No effective chemical or cultural control measures are available. Integrated approaches have been developed (ProMED post 20090419.1483), which may include cultural practices, certified clean planting material, and biocontrol agents such as _Trichoderma_ species (for example, ProMED post 20160317.4102576 and see link below). Breeding programmes and molecular techniques are being used to develop crop cultivars with increased resistance or tolerance to the different fungal strains. Constant vigilance is required in areas where the fungus is present to prevent flare-ups and recognise emerging new strains.

Several races of the pathogen exist, varying in host range. Cavendish banana varieties (cultivars within the _Musa_ AAA group, see links below) replaced the original eating varieties (such as Gros Michel) because they are resistant to the original fungal strain. They include most of the current commercial eating bananas. Cavendish-affecting strains, such as temperate (subtropical) and tropical races 4 (TR4), as well as a new strain of race 1 (ProMED posts 20210105.8075029, 20101223.4510), have emerged since from Asia and Oceania.

TR4 has now been reported in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and more recently also the Americas (ProMED posts 20190820.6630576). TR4 is of great concern worldwide; development of TR4-resistant cultivars has become a top priority for many national banana industries (see previous ProMED posts in the archives).

In the Philippines, PD was first reported in 1920 from northern and central areas. It was confirmed in commercial Cavendish in the mid 1970s in southern Mindanao, which probably indicates the arrival of TR4 (see ProMED post 20111014.3072). _Musa_ crops in the country are also affected by the viral bunchy top disease (e.g., ProMED post 20191215.6842101).
