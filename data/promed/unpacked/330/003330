The mysterious viral outbreak in western Uganda's Bundibugyo district has
been contained, Dr Sam Okware, the health ministry's commissioner of health
services, has confirmed. The disease has symptoms similar to Marburg
[hemorrhagic] fever. "There are no more infections, and deaths have
reduced. The patients are also recovering quickly. The viral attack has
been contained, and we hope there will be no more deaths," Dr. Okware said.
By press time, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United
States had not yet determined what the disease was, after analyzing the 20
blood samples Uganda's health ministry sent them.

One more person died of the virus last week. This raises the death toll to
14 people over the last 3 months. "There is a likelihood that it might be
Rift Valley fever, typhus fever or leptospirosis, which comes from contact
with rodents [that is, endemic typhus and leptospirosis only]," Dr Okware
explained. He said that if it is Rift Valley fever there is need for
greater care. "This disease is very infectious, since it is transmitted by
mosquitoes from animal to animal and from animals to man."

Dr Okware said the viral outbreak had been clustered into 3 groups. The 1st
he said comprised a family who may have eaten an infected goat. All the 15
family members were infected, and 4 of them, including a boy, died. The 2nd
involved a patient admitted to the labor ward in Kikyo Health Centre who in
due course infected 5 other people with the virus. Four of them died days
later. Okware said the 3rd group was infected after handling the bodies of
the victims without any protective gear. Six of the 20 who were infected died.

According to the team from Bundibugyo, the disease is in 12 villages of the
district.

[The cause of this outbreak of lethal disease remains obscure. A viral
causation is still favored, but there is little supporting evidence. None
of the locally proposed diagnoses seem appropriate. The outcome of
laboratory investigation at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
in Atlanta is awaited.
