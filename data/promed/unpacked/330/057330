From the reserve fund of the government of the Saratov region, RUB 10 million [USD 134 000] will be allocated for emergency vaccination of farm animals in connection with the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in the Orenburg region and Kazakhstan. The corresponding order was given on 12 Jan [2022] by the governor of the Saratov Region, Valery Radaev.

According to the deputy chairman of the regional government Roman Kovalsky, an outbreak of FMD was detected in the Orenburg region, where the disease, presumably, came from neighboring Kazakhstan. In this regard, the import of livestock products from the Orenburg region was banned in the Saratov region. Veterinary posts have been set up on the border roads.

The Ministry of Agriculture of the region was instructed to work with the federal center on further purchases of the vaccine.

"The Saratov region is a border area; we constantly face risks of [livestock] diseases. We need to more actively work with the population. Residents of border areas should be aware of the threat of the spread of FMD, about how dangerous this disease is. We will find funds as soon as possible to start vaccination of animals as soon as possible," said Valery Radaev.

IA Regnum recalls that infectious cattle disease [see comment] was detected in the Alga district of the Aktobe region of Kazakhstan at the end of November 2021.

[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for his above submission as well as for the following media sources, presented with their abridged information:

1. https://tass.ru/ekonomika/13409173 (dated 12 Jan 2022):
Belarus introduced a ban on the import of livestock from the Orenburg region and Kazakhstan.
The import of meat, meat products, raw materials, and hunting trophies is also prohibited.

2. https://tvrain.ru/news/v_rossiju_zapretili_vvozit_moloko_i_mjaso_iz_kazahstana-545633/?from=rss (dated 12 Jan 2022):
Russia's Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Supervision (Rosselkhoznadzor) announced a ban on the import of the following items from Kazakhstan:
a. Live animals susceptible to FMD, their skins and wool, not heat-treated feed, and used equipment for keeping and slaughtering animals;
b. Milk and dairy products that have not been subjected to heat treatment (which guarantees the destruction of the FMD virus);
c. Raw meat and meat products.
The decision, published on the website of the department, is explained by the spread of the FMD virus in Kazakhstan.

Kazakhstan's last OIE report of FMD outbreak dates back to 2013. Its FMD situation during the following years has been visited in several RFI postings of ProMED (2016, 2017, 2021).

The event referred to in the Regnum report "in the Alga district of the Aktobe region of Kazakhstan at the end of November 2021" was covered in ProMED post 20211121.8699810. Aktobe borders Russia's Saratov oblast (province), in the southeastern section of European Russia, Lower Volga area.

In the past, the FMD serotypes reported from Kazakhstan were O and A. - Mod.AS
