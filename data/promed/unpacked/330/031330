Synopsis of National Public Radio Broadcast on the Marburg Fever Outbreak
-------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) says Marburg Virus has sickened 140
people in Angola and killed 132, most of them young children. International
health organizations are rushing personnel and equipment to the war-ravaged
country to stem the epidemic. Still, WHO experts told National Public Radio
(NPR)'s Richard Knox that they expect the Marburg toll to get much larger.
Marburg hemorrhagic fever isn't as much feared as its cousin Ebola
hemorrhagic fever. But in fact, they're hard to tell apart. [Clinically
they are associated with similar disease symptoms, but the 2 viruses do not
cross-react antigenically and are easily distinguishable by serology and
RT-PCR assay. - Mod.CP]. In both cases, victims bleed to death, often from
every orifice and every organ. Few infections are as deadly. That's why the
WHO, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Health Canada and
the medical aid group MSF (Medecins sans Frontieres) are rushing to Angola.
Dr. Mike Ryan is managing WHO's response from Geneva. He said that: "The
cases counted so far don't include victims who died outside hospitals. Some
WHO experts expect a doubling of the current toll. That would make this
Angolan outbreak the largest Marburg epidemic ever...and larger than almost
any Ebola [hemorrhagic fever] outbreak. International workers and
protective gear are just arriving." So Ryan said also that it will take
time to show results. "We're going to see further waves. Even with the best
of interventions, you're going to see at least 2 waves of transmission
before you start to gain control of the problem."
So far most Marburg cases have been in a northern province called Uige. But
there are reports of cases across Angola's border with the Democratic
Republic of Congo. Dr. Pierre Formenty, the WHO's top Marburg expert, is
struck by how widely the virus has already spread. Dr. Formenty stated
that: "It is the 1st time we have geographically speaking so large an
outbreak of Marburg fever. We have cases not just in Uige city itself but
in different cities around Uige, up to 20 to 40 kilometres away. The
outbreak probably started last October [2004]. Many people got infected in
hospitals." Dr. Formenty thinks sloppy injection practices explain why most
victims are below age 5. Doctors often give medicine to young children by
injection rather than by mouth.
The biggest fear is that Marburg will begin spreading from person to person
in Angolan cities. There have been cases in the provincial capital of Uige,
a city of 200 000. And 3 people have died in Luanda, a coastal city of more
than three million that is Angola's capital. Luanda has several other
possible cases. But Dr. Formenty said the known and suspected victims came
from Uige -- and didn't contract Marburg fever in Luanda. Formenty stated
that: "Today we have no evidence of transmission within Luanda. We have
evidence of people who have escaped Uige to die in Luanda, yes. ...but we
have no secondary transmission in Luanda or in any other city. Finding and
isolating Marburg cases in a big city is hard enough. Tracing people they
might have infected is daunting. That's why Angolan and WHO officials are
trying to dampen panic, which could cause people to flee from Uige to the
capital...and bring the virus with them."
Dr. Christa Kitz, who is coordinating the work of Medicins sans Frontieres
in Luanda, stated that: "In Luanda it's still a little bit calm but we are
hearing from Uige province that health-care workers are fleeing hospitals,
that they are not returning to work, and also that the population is trying
to run away from the area. In Luanda city there is no real panic reaction
yet but the fear grows every day."

Suspected Marburg Hemorrhagic Fever Cases Hospitalized in Italy
-------------------------------------------------
Italian hospital staff have put 9 patients in isolation, suspected of
contact with the Marburg virus, an Ebola-like [disease] which has broken
out in Angola, a World Health Organisation spokesperson has said.
"9 people who were in contact with an ill person were isolated in an
Italian hospital," Ms Chaib said, without giving details of in which town
or what nationality the possible victims were, or if they were ill.
Last week, an Italian paediatrician died of haemorrhagic fever in Angola,
according to Medici con Africa, the relief organization for which she
worked. The WHO was unable to say whether the 9 patients in Italy had been
in touch with this woman.
The WHO ruled out 2 other suspected cases reported in Portugal earlier this
week following medical tests.

Angola: Marburg Hemorrhagic Fever Spreading: Death Toll Reaches 142
-------------------------------------------------
The death toll from Marburg virus had reached 142 in the Angolan province
of Uige alone, the province's governor Antonio Bento Kangulo said on Fri 1
Apr 2005, after the disease reached the country's 4th province. The
governor said a total of 150 cases of the disease had been registered in
the northern province [of Uige], which has been the epicentre of the
outbreak. "From the beginning up to the last 24 hours we have a total of
150 cases, including 142 dead," the governor said in an interview with
private radio Luanda Antena Comercial.
Earlier the southern African country's health ministry said Marburg virus
had reached a 4th province in Angola, bringing the disease closer to the
capital. According to the last official toll for the country overall given
by the health ministry and World Health Organisation, 130 people had been
killed by the virus in the country by 31 Mar 2005, with 137 cases registered.
The Marburg outbreak has claimed a record number of lives, overtaking the
earlier peak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola's neighbour.
