_Dirofilaria repens_ infections in humans are increasing in Belarus
------------------------------------------------------------------
In 2013, 21 cases of dirofilariasis were recorded in the country. The helminths develop and move around in the human body causing pain and inflammation, said Andrey Vedernikov, physician and parasitic diseases specialist of the Republican Center of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Public Health. "Until the middle of the 1990s, dirofilariasis was not registered in Belarus. Now the disease is not exotic for us," said the specialist. In order to prevent [the disease] the doctor advised people to protect themselves from mosquito bites.

The infection is caused when the filarial nematode _Dirofilaria repens_ infects the human body. The natural reservoir is cats and dogs and the infection is transmitted to humans through mosquitoes. The incubation period is up to a year. During this time the larva grows up to 15-20 centimetres [6-8 in] in length. A key clinical sign is its ability to move under the skin, where it can move up to 15 centimetres a day. The eyes are favorite place of localization of the larvae.

[A recent paper reviewed the situation of _Dirofilaria repens_ in Russia (Ermakova LA, Nagorny SA, Krivorotova EY, et al. _Dirofilaria repens_ in the Russian Federation: current epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment from a federal reference center perspective. Int J Infect Dis. 2014; pii: S1201-9712(14)01445-3; http://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(14)01445-3/fulltext.)

The epidemiology is believed to be the same in Belarus.

Dirofilaria repens has also been described from Northern Germany (Czajka C, Becker N, Joest H, et al. Stable transmission of _Dirofilaria repens_ nematodes, northern Germany. Emerg Infect Dis. 2014; 20(2): 328-31; <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3901495/) and from the Balkans (Vichova B, Miterpakova M, Iglodyova A. Molecular detection of co-infections with _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ and/or _Babesia canis canis_ in _Dirofilaria_-positive dogs from Slovakia. Vet Parasitol. 2014. pii: S0304-4017(14)00064-8; abstract available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24630708. - Mod.EP
