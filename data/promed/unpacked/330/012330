H5N1 HPAI virus has been identified from these birds, and HA0 cleavage sequencing demonstrated its high pathogenicity.

The cleaning and disinfection of the environment and facilities were completed on 7 Jul 2012. All staff in contact with the birds have been under monitoring of the Health Authority for 10 days and found healthy.

According to the OIE Terrestrial Code, this event does not affect the free status of H5N1 HPAI in Chinese Taipei.

[This is an extremely good example of the important public health work done by port inspection officials. One can only imagine how these birds were being smuggled into Taiwan and how they were found. Unfortunately, the welfare of these smuggled birds was probably not a high priority for the smugglers, but another, absolutely key question is what kind of potential human contacts ensued because these HPAI H5N1 birds were subjected to smuggling.

Also, smuggled birds are not the only concern when it comes to protection of human and animal health. Meats and other foods that can cause foot and mouth disease or African swine fever are always a big concern. The movement of smuggled bushmeat has global ecosystem health implications as well as the potential to aid the emergence of a novel virus, as Nathan Wolfe's work has indicated.

So, when budget cutters around the world want to sharpen their respective axes, they should think carefully of how to preserve a viable, effective system and what it costs to do so.

For those who have further interest in this vital subject, the Institute of Medicine's (IOM) report from the US National Academies is available.
