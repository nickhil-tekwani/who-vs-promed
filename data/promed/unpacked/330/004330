What everyone was afraid of happened: Xylella fastidiosa has emerged in the Netherlands. An inspector from the Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA) found the contaminated Coffea plant in an office building in Noordwijkerhout [South Holland province].

Nurseries had been concerned for some time. The question was not whether the bacteria would appear, but when. They have taken all necessary precautions and are very careful doing business with southern European countries. The nursery sector should above all remain alert, risks are too great to want to do business cheaply.

The dreaded bacterium has been spreading in Europe for some time now. Recently, it was also found in a trading company in Belgium [ProMED-mail post 20181022.6105629].

[_Xylella fastidiosa_ (Xf) clogs the xylem of plants leading to wilting, necrosis and often death. It causes many serious crop diseases such as Pierce's disease of grapevine; leaf scorch of coffee, almond and olive; peach phony disease; plum leaf scald; citrus variegated chlorosis; lucerne dwarf; leaf scorch of a range of other woody species. Latent infections of wild species as potential pathogen reservoirs have also been reported. Several subspecies of Xf have been proposed and more research is needed to determine their host range and risks to crops. Initially, all strains of _Xylella_ had been classified into a single species, but a second species in the genus, _X. taiwanensis_, has recently been reported as the cause of a pear leaf scorch (see ProMED-mail post 20181022.6105629).

Xf is spread by xylem-feeding insects, but also by grafting and with infected plant material. It is not seed borne. Moist conditions favour the vectors and therefore Xf-associated diseases. Disease management is difficult due to the large numbers of hosts and vectors and may include use of clean planting and grafting material, as well as vector control. Both the bacterium and its main vectors are of serious quarantine concern.

Xf had previously been reported mainly from the Americas. In 2013, it was reported in olives from Italy (ProMED-mail posts 20131101.2033095, 20140820.2708739 & 20140424.2425497). That outbreak was thought to represent the first appearance of Xf in the European region due to imports of contaminated plant material. However, the detection of multiple subspecies in a diversity of hosts, including some asymptomatic ornamentals acting as reservoir host, subsequently suggested that some Xf strains had to have been present in the region for a considerable amount of time, in order to be able to affect a multitude of local hosts. Xf is currently considered the most serious phytosanitary threat to European grape and fruit production and the pathogen has been added to the A1 quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

According to the photo supplied with the story above, the coffee plant with Xf symptoms is a mature pot plant with well developed symptoms which would suggest that the infection occurred some time ago. However, it seems highly unlikely that Xf was present at the seedling stage of this large plant, or the plant would have died in the meantime. Therefore, the source of the infection may be local and remains to be determined urgently because Xf may already have been in the country previous to this detection. An unidentified source may exist posing a risk of further Xf infections.
