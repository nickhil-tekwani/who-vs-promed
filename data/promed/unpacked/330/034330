[*****With the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito (the vector for yellow fever and dengue viruses) rampant in Florida and spreading in California, and dengue introduced into Florida with autochthonous cases occurring in the state (see ProMED archives below), there is an obvious risk of the re-introduction of yellow fever to the USA by an infected traveler arriving from an endemic zone in South America or Africa. - Mod.JW
