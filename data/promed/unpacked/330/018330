[Remarkably, no clinical cases of the disease were reported from outbreak No 1; the decision to regard it an outbreak leading to culling of the entire population may have been based upon detection of the virus on the premises of this farm and not from dead birds.

The summary of the S. Korean HPAI H5N6 event which started on [Fri 17 Nov 2017], as of [Thu 11 Jan 2018], is the following:

Total outbreaks = 14 (Submitted)
Species/ Susceptible/ Cases/ Deaths/ Killed and disposed of/ Slaughtered
Birds/ 433 936/ 1219/ 359/ 433 577/ 0

The above data, with a respective map, are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000025671_20180111_164951.pdf.

According to the detailed control measures as communicated above, vaccination against HPAI H5N6 is "prohibited" in S. Korea. However, subscribers' attention is drawn to 2 recent press releases issued in late December 2017 by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Livestock Food and Feed, at https://tinyurl.com/ybrpaaz2 and at https://tinyurl.com/y7zur7lp.

These press releases seem to address the government's plan to build a "AI Antigen Bank stockpile and emergency vaccination system" and to prepare for emergencies of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by HPAI clade H5 virus strains. The press releases addressing this interesting topic, heralding some possible change in S. Korea's non-vaccination policy, have been published in Korean only; as soon as a reliable English translation becomes available, ProMED-mail will include it in a due post.
