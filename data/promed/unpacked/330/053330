KUALA LUMPUR -- Some 70,000 people living near pig farms in seven states
are at risk if there is an outbreak of viral encephalitis in their areas.
This is based on an initial report on a survey conducted to identify the
areas and people at risk, said Health Minister Datuk Chua Jui Meng.
Among the preventive steps being undertaken by the ministry are fogging and
educating residents about the disease, a report in The Sun newspaper said.

Datuk Chua said he would ask the members of the Federation of Livestock
Farmers' Association to pay for vaccination for their workers and farm
inhabitants, adding that the ministry will take care of high-risk groups
outside the farms. Each state had been told to initiate its own programme.
"The Cabinet has recently approved an additional allocation for the
purchase of the vaccine against viral encephalitis." He added that the
amount would be worked out between the ministry and the Treasury.
