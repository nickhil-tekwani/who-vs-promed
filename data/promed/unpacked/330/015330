A plant disease affecting tomatoes and capsicums has been detected in some farms, said the National Food Safety Office (ONSSA). They say that this disease has been present in several regions of the world since 2014. To limit the repercussions, ONSSA stresses the importance of biosecurity measures. Farms and nurseries have been alerted to the disease and were informed about measures to be taken in case of confirmation of its presence on their premises.

All plant seeds are subjected to laboratory analysis to ensure freedom from seed-transmitted diseases before import to the country. Investigations are underway to trace the origins of the infected seeds.

[A large number of pathogens causing diseases of solanaceous crops have been reported from the region. They include several begomoviruses of the leaf curl and yellow leaf curl clades (for example, ProMED post 20181012.6086559); seed-transmitted tombamoviruses such as _Tomato brown rugose fruit virus_ (for example, ProMED post 20200507.7307615); as well as _Candidatus_ Liberibacter solanacearum (for example, ProMED post 20190213.6311149). Tomato seeds are traded widely and are known to pose a risk for spreading viruses and other pathogens internationally (for example, ProMED post 20140122.2222560).

The report above seems to imply the identification of a pathogen, as well as a connection of the outbreak with infected seed. However, no further details are given on a potential pathogen identity. It is equally unclear what evidence these statements are based on or how reliable they may be. While the quarantine screening of imported seeds apparently carried by Morocco is vital for any country, for most pathogens, reliable molecular diagnosis is needed for identification and to be able to design suitable management strategies for farmers.
