Preliminary tests indicate that 13 more cattle from a western Wyoming
herd may be infected with brucellosis, dampening hopes that the
disease may be contained to a single herd.

"We still have very high hopes that we'll maintain this to one herd
and not lose our free status, but that's probably just a prayer right
now if you want the truth," Jim Schwartz, director of the Wyoming
Livestock Board, said Friday [20 Jun 2008].

The state has conducted preliminary blood tests on 327 cattle
belonging to a rancher near Daniel in Sublette County, assistant
state veterinarian Jim Logan said. Two cattle from the rancher's
separate purebred Angus herd were determined earlier this month [June
2008] to have the disease, which can cause pregnant cows to abort
their young. The remaining 250 or so Angus cattle will be tested next
week, Logan said. Once the entire herd is tested, the state will
begin testing surrounding herds belonging to other ranchers.

While the state has confirmed the presence of brucellosis, the
federal government was still conducting tests to make the
confirmation official.

Wyoming is in danger of losing its brucellosis-free status if the
disease is found in another herd or if the Daniel rancher declines to
slaughter his entire herd.

Schwartz said it's "fairly high," but not alarming to have 15 cattle
in the herd test positive for brucellosis. "It's really a fairly
clean herd but we do have more than just the 2 that were initially
found," he said.

He noted that wild elk herds commonly have 30 percent infection rates
and some bison herds have had up to 70 percent infection rates.

The cattle from the Daniel area herd have been quarantined.

Schwartz said the latest case of brucellosis infection has ranchers
in western Wyoming concerned. "There's a lot of nervousness," he
said. "It's going to have huge implications on our industry."

If the state loses its brucellosis-free status, Wyoming would have to
impose costly testing requirements for all cattle in the state that
are sold or moved to another state.

Schwartz said the brucellosis issue adds to the frustration of many
ranchers already dealing with wolf and grizzly bear issues. "They
kind of question why they stay in business," he said.
