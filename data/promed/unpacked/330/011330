Japanese agricultural officials confirmed Saturday [13 Jan 2007] that
the virulent H5N1 bird flu virus caused the deaths of thousands of
chickens at a poultry farm in southern Japan this week, Kyodo news
agency reported.
At least 2400 chickens have died since Wednesday [10 Jan 2007] at a
farm in the town of Kiyotake in Miyazaki prefecture (state), and
prefectural officials were conducting bird flu tests.
The final results confirmed that the deaths were linked to the H5N1
strain of the virus, Kyodo said.
Miyazaki and Agricultural Ministry officials said the report could
not be confirmed immediately [see comment].
There has been one confirmed human case involving the H5N1 virus in
Japan, but no reported human deaths. Japan's most recent outbreak
occurred in Kyoto in 2004. Japan has had several outbreaks of bird
flu viruses that are not harmful to humans since then.
On Friday, the government set up a task force and ordered 20 poultry
farms within a 10-km (6.2-mile) radius of the affected operator to
halt shipments of eggs and chickens for the time being, said Toru
Inoue, another prefectural official.
The Agriculture Ministry also ordered a nationwide inspection of
poultry farms to detect any signs of sick birds, and environment
officials began a national survey to look into the possibility that a
bird flu virus might have been brought by migratory birds from other
parts of Asia.
The latest poultry deaths occurred at a farm with 12 000 breeding and
egg-laying chickens.
Inoue said officials were to take further epidemic prevention
procedures if the test confirms bird flu at the farm, including
destroying the remaining birds.
Miyazaki, about 900 kilometers (560 miles) southwest of Tokyo, is the
nation's largest poultry producing region.

[From the above newswire it apparently appears that Kyodo's
reported confirmation of H5N1 in the Miyazaki outbreak is not (yet?)
supported by official sources. It will help if official confirmation
-- or otherwise -- becomes available.
From the following URL, which includes a map: " The town of
Kiyotake, located in the southern center of Miyazaki Prefecture,
borders the city of Miyazaki on the North, East, and South, and the
town of Tano on the West." It is on Kyushu, the southernmost island
in Japan. <http://www.town.kiyotake.miyazaki.jp/english/profile/index.html>
