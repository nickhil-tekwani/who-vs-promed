AMERICAN PHYTOPATHOLOGICAL SOCIETY (APS)

The American Phytopathological Society (APS) is an international scientific
organization that promotes the study of plant diseases and their control
through publications, meetings, symposia, workshops, and the World Wide
Web. APS advances modern concepts in plant health management in
agricultural, urban and forest settings.
The Society was founded in 1908 and has grown from 130 charter members to
over 5,000 plant pathologists and scientists worldwide, with 30% of the
membership outside of the United States.
APS members speak collectively through Society officers on important issues
affecting plant pathology and closely related fields. The society is
governed by the APS Council that focuses on the internal affairs of the
Society as well as professional and scientific concerns. The Council
supervises the work of subject matter standing committees including:
bacteriology; biochemistry, physiology, and molecular biology; biological
control; chemical control; diagnosticians; diseases of ornamental plants
and turf grasses, environmental quality and plant health; epidemiology;
exobiology and space phytopathology; forest pathology; genetics; integrated
pest management; mycology; mycorrhizae; nematology; plant disease
detection; plant disease losses; post-harvest pathology and mycotoxicology;
seed pathology; soil microbiology and root diseases; tropical plant
pathology and virology.
APS publishes 3 specialized Journals. _Phytopathology_ is the most widely
read international research journal of applied plant pathology and the
most-cited source in botany core journals. Each volume groups papers under
subject matter categories. _Plant Disease_ is the respected international
journal of plant pathology for rapid reporting of research, new disease and
epidemics, fungicides and nematicides, and new products and equipment.
_Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions_ (MPMI) presents original research on
the molecular biology and molecular genetics of pathological, symbiotic and
associative interactions of microbes with plants.
APS Press Books and Slides APS Press publishes key reference books, field
guides, laboratory manuals, and other titles to include Compendium of Plant
Disease Series, Symposium Series, Biological and Cultural Tests, and
Phytopathological Classics. Both hard copy and electronic versions are
available for some items as are CD-Rom disks. APSnet consolidates
information relevant to the profession into one convenient source located
at http://www.scisoc.org/.
Membership surveys also indicate a strong need for APS to become involved
with public policy issues, ranging from funding for agricultural research
to regulatory issues to increasing the awareness of the public, policy
makers and scientific organizations about the science of plant pathology.
The Office of Public Affairs and Education (OPAE) is an outreach program,
created by the APS council, in 1996. OPAE's mission is to educate the
public about plant health, plant diseases and associated microorganisms and
strengthen advocacy for science-based public policy. OPAE coordinates
interactions with other scientific and professional organizations to
increase media coverage of plant health issues in order to demonstrate the
value of plant pathology to society.
THE INTERNATIONAL COMPONENT OF APS

About 10 years ago, APS established The Office of International Programs
(OIP) to give direction and focus to some of the international activities
of the Society. Specific objectives of OIP are to: provide coordination of
APS international activities; promote collaboration among plant
pathologists and other scientists of all nationalities; and facilitate
teaching, research, and extension with the aim of increasing agricultural
production through improved plant health, especially in developing
countries. Reports on OIP activities are given periodically in the APS
newsletter. Also, an ever-expanding display by OIP is prominent at the APS
annual meeting. The emphasis on OIP has been on plant pathology issues in
developing countries, but any topic in international plant pathology is
appropriate for action by the office. Those interested in making
suggestions or participating in OIP programs should contact the current
director, Dr. Luis Sequeira <lzs@plantpath.wisc.edu>
