An entire hamlet near here is eerily emptying out day by day due to a
rabies scare. Villagers say they cannot take any chances as 2 dozen
farm animals have died, and no medical assistance has reached them in 10 days.

Bara Bhangal, which has the state's remotest polling station, is
located in Kangra district [see map at <http://healthmap.org/r/00-H>]
at an altitude of over 2800 metres and is not accessible by road.
While officials are yet to confirm whether the disease is spreading
there, the village of 400 people is running scared and migrating
despite snow-laden pathways.

"More than 12 cattle and an equal number of sheep have died due to
rabies. A large number of animals have symptoms of the disease.
Despite repeated requests to the administration, no veterinarian team
has been deputed to the village so far," said Kanchana Devi, head of
the gram panchayat of the village.

She along with other villagers have migrated to Bir in Baijnath
subdistrict, near Palampur town, some 250 km from the state capital Shimla.

"After trudging more than 75 km, we managed to reach Bir in 3 days.
Most of the areas are under a thick blanket of snow (following heavy
snowfall)," she said.

According to her, 4 people who are still stuck in the village have
reported symptoms of the disease.

Sheep and cattle rearing is the main occupation of the people, who are nomads.

Akshay Jasrotia, a member of the Kangra Zila Parishad, who is taking
up their cause with the administration, said the situation is quite
grim. "Since the satellite telephone installed in the village is not
working, it's difficult to get the exact information. The people who
have migrated say the situation is quite grim there. We are
requesting the government to airlift a team of veterinarians and
doctors to the village to treat both animals and humans," he said.

He said since most trekking routes leading to Bara Bhangal are out of
bounds due to snow, the helicopter is the only mode of transportation
to reach there. Bara Bhangal is also accessible through the Thamsar
Pass, located at an attitude of 4700 metres.

Kangra Additional District Magistrate Sandeep Kumar told IANS that a
team of doctors was sent to the village last week, but it returned
mid-way due to harsh climatic conditions.

"A 2nd team was sent from another route in Chamba district 2 days
ago. But so far, we have not been able to establish contact with
them. If the team again fails to reach, then we will arrange a
helicopter for them," he said.

On the spread of rabies, he said: "From initial reports, it seems
that animals had died due to rabies. However, there is no official
confirmation regarding the spread of the disease in humans. So far,
80 people have migrated to Bir. But this is their annual practice. We
have vaccinated both the humans and the livestock. We have not
noticed any symptoms of rabies," he said.

Bara Bhangal is part of the Dhauladhar Wildlife Sanctuary, which is
spread over 944 sq km at an altitude above 3000 metres.

[The above newswire is confused and confusing. Animals, such as sheep
and cattle, which may have been bitten by rabid animals such as dogs
or fauna (foxes?), will show the typical rabies clinical signs at
least 10 days to several weeks after their exposure. Since the
clinical signs observed are not included in the report, it is
difficult to check the validity of the published diagnosis.

The description of the disease in humans is rather strange. People
who remained in the village are not likely to get infected just
because of their location. Rabies is not transmitted by aerosols or
casual contact; a bite, or at least close contact of infected
material (e.g. saliva) with non-intact skin are necessary to infect.
Information on the disease in animals and humans is requested. - Mod.AS]
