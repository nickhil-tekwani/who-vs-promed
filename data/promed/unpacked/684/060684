Elephant Dies After Herpes Virus Treatment
-------------------------------------
A young elephant died early Saturday [1 Dec 2007]
after being treated for a herpes virus at
Springfield's [MO] Dickerson Park Zoo.

On Thursday [29 Nov 2007], keepers noticed early
symptoms of the elephant herpes virus on the
16-month-old Asian elephant calf, named Nisha.
The symptoms included a lesion on the roof of
Nisha's mouth and discoloration of her tongue.

Nisha received an aggressive treatment of an
anti-viral drug in combination with antibiotics and a drug to reduce swelling.

Zoo officials said the elephant herpes virus is usually fatal within 5 days.

Group Claims Zoo Number 1 Hotspot for Elephant Herpes
----------------------------------------------------
Zoo officials say their elephants are well cared
for and well loved. "They probably spend more
time with these elephants than they do their
families," says Melinda Arnold, spokesperson for
the zoo. However, zoo officials are getting no
love from an animal rights group based in
California, called In Defense of Animals (IDA).
This week, the animal group called the Dickerson
Park Zoo the hot spot for herpes transmission --
the same virus believed to have killed 16-month
old Nisha just a few days ago. "We think that
Dickerson Park Zoo is example number one of the
reason zoos in general must place a moratorium on
all breeding of Asian elephants and severe
restrictions on the transfer of Asian elephants
between zoos," says Suzanne Roy, with IDA.

"They are an anti-zoo organization," says Arnold.
Arnold also says that the keepers follow
guidelines by the Association of Zoos and
Aquariums when it comes to elephant breeding.

Both the zoo and the animal rights group say they
want the best for the elephants, but they're
looking at one set of numbers very differently.
Since the early 1990s, 6 elephants were born to
the elephants housed at the zoo, 5 of them came
down with the herpes virus, and 4 of them died.

"Given the rate of infection and death of the
young elephants born there, it's hard to deny
that they're contaminated and have a problem with the virus," says Roy.

But zoo officials say the group is
misinterpreting the numbers. "The animal
extremists would have you believe that we are
somehow more vulnerable to the virus, some of
that is because we've had more births here," says
Arnold. "We've had more who are in that very
vulnerable age category." Zoo officials say the
most vulnerable elephants to contract herpes are
younger than 3 years old. They say the numbers
are being misinterpreted because they have had
several calves. Zoo officials are also quick to
point out that herpes has been found in the wild.

Meanwhile, the group is calling for the zoo to stop breeding.

Elephant breeding under fire
-----------------------------------------------
Animal rights activists called Woodland Park
Zoo's elephant breeding program "reckless" and
"irresponsible," and demanded Tuesday [4 Dec
2007] that zoo leaders abandon plans to
artificially inseminate an elephant next month
[January 2008]. The group wants to stop the
insemination of Chai until a treatment or cure is
found for herpes, the virus that killed the
elephant's 6-year-old offspring, Hansa, in June
[2007]. "It is just common sense. You have a
contaminated facility. There is a very, very good
chance you will have another death," Catherine
Doyle from In Defense of Animals told zoo board
members. "It is unconscionable for the zoo to
risk subjecting another young elephant to this
fatal disease and putting Chai through the
anguish of watching another baby die a terrible
death." The activists also are asking the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service not to extend a permit
to the zoo that allows it to import the semen
from Canada. "It is a lethal combination. They
are playing Russian roulette with the offspring," Doyle said.

Woodland Park zookeepers are hoping to inseminate
Chai, 29, an Asian elephant, next month with
sperm from an Asian bull elephant named Rex that
lives at African Lion Safari in Ontario, Canada.
A total of 2 elephants have died from elephant
herpesvirus there. It would be the 5th
insemination attempt since Hansa was born in November 2000.

Zoo leaders responded swiftly Tuesday [4 Dec
2007], noting that they are committed to the
elephant breeding program, and have seen no
scientific evidence that has persuaded them to
change their plans. "There is always a risk in
everything," Deputy Director Bruce Bohmke said.
"If you have one death, that doesn't make it more
likely that you will have another."

While the activists accused the zoo of wanting
another baby elephant to attract more visitors
and increase revenue, Bohmke said breeding
programs are important to give zoo visitors an
appreciation for the animals, teach them about
their endangered environments and motivate them
to donate to conservation efforts. "The idea of
not breeding elephants doesn't make sense. Let's
work on the problem. The only way we can answer
these questions is through breeding and research," Bohmke said.

Nancy Hawkes, Woodland Park general curator, said
the herpes virus is never found in semen, which
is tested before use. She said there has never
been a correlation made between one herpes death
at a zoo and a 2nd death. The highly fatal
Elephant Endotheliotropic Herpesvirus has caused
more than 20 percent of the elephant deaths in
North America in the past 2 decades. "That is the
problem. We want to be part of the solution," Hawkes said.

Hansa was the 1st elephant born in Washington.
After years of unsuccessful artificial
insemination, she was conceived after her mother,
Chai, was sent to Dickerson Park Zoo in Missouri
to mate with an elephant named Onyx. Hansa
started looking sick less than 2 weeks before she
died. Zoo officials sent blood and fecal samples
to laboratories hoping to find the cause of her
illness. Weeks after the elephant's death, it was
confirmed the herpes virus was the cause, but it
was a version of the virus that hadn't been seen
before and wasn't recognized in earlier tests.

Animal activists draw a link between elephants
that have visited the Missouri zoo and the virus.
"Elephants who spent time at Dickerson Park Zoo
were potentially at risk of becoming (virus)
carriers," according to the In Defense of Animals
report given to zoo board members.

But Laura Richman, a veterinary pathologist at
the National Zoo in Washington, DC, a leading
expert on elephant herpes virus, uncovered the
strain that killed Hansa. Although it was unknown
by scientists, it has been in elephant
populations for millions of years, she said. The
virus can't be detected in healthy elephants,
only when they get sick. "Hansa would have gotten
it from another elephant," Richman said. Hansa
had not left Woodland Park Zoo since she was
born, which suggests the virus was passed from
one of the zoo's other elephants, either her
mother, Chai, or Watoto or Bamboo. Richman said
there is no way to know if another baby elephant
at Woodland Park would die from the virus. "We
don't know why one animal gets sick and not
another, that is why we are studying it," Richman
said. "They are exposed to the same secretions,
the same elephants." Richman said she encourages
the zoo to continue its breeding program.

"Their program is no different than breeding in
the wild," she said. "Even In Defense of Animals
would support keeping the elephant population on
Earth. If they want breeding to halt in zoos
because of the virus, it means they support
stopping breeding in the wild too, because this virus also occurs in the wild."

[However ProMED-mail Rapporteur Joe Dudley
commented as follows: The statement in the 3d
article that the "elephant herpes virus occurs in
the wild" is somewhat disingenuous, as this virus
originates from African elephants, not Asian
elephants, and has been introduced to captive
populations only through keeping these 2 species
together in captive environments. It is usually a
relatively harmless chronic infection in immune
African elephants but is lethal for Asian
elephants. There may also be a 2nd strain,
supposed to be lethal for African elephants. Joe
wrote his University of Alaska doctoral
dissertation on elephant foraging ecology based
on his research in Zimbabwe during 1993-98 and
has published extensively on African elephants. Relevant herpes virus links:

If ever there was an exhibit with an awe factor
at the Houston Zoo, it would have to be the
elephants. Mac, the newest attraction, is now
just over a year old. Cute, sure. But there's
something else about these elephants that isn't
readily apparent ­- something which, in the
future, may or may not become a problem. "It's
latent. Some animals manifest it. Others live for
a long time with it, like our bull elephant and
our female," Zoo Director Rick Barongi said. "It"
is a deadly elephant version of the herpes virus.
"For the most part, the animal swells up in the
membranes and dies," elephant advocate Les Schobert said.

That was the case with Kimba, a 13-year-old Asian
elephant who died at the zoo 3 years ago. She was
one of 5 born at the zoo to succumb to the virus.
Three of those died after they had been transported to other facilities.

A new report by In Defense of Animals has
identified the Houston Zoo as one of 3 hot spots
for the virus. In Defense of Animals is calling
for a halt to the breeding of Asian elephants,
not just at the Houston Zoo, but around the
country. It's also calling for severe
restrictions on the transport of elephants between facilities.

But not everyone is convinced.

"Breeding elephants has nothing to do with herpes
transmission. It's in the population. It gets
transmitted in many different ways," Barongi
said. But so far, the zoo says the virus hasn't
shown up in its star attraction, Mac.

[It should be noted that Kiba, an Asian elphant
raised in the Houston Zoo, died 9 months after
being transfered in 1997 to the Berlin Zoological
Garden from an endotheliotropic virus 97percent
to 100 percent similar to US strains. See
