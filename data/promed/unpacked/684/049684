Beijing saw an outbreak of hand-foot-mouth disease [HFMD] with more than 2600 cases reported per week from 26 May 2014 to 22 Jun 2014, said the capital's disease prevention center on Sun 29 Jun 2014. In the 4 consecutive weeks during the period, the number of weekly reported hand-foot-mouth cases increased from 2645 to 3013 in Beijing, said the Beijing Disease Prevention and Control Center.

The cases were more than in the same period of 2013, but the critical or death cases were almost the same, said the municipal health authorities.

Hand-foot-mouth disease is a viral illness that usually affects infants and children younger than 5 years old. The disease starts with a slight fever followed by blisters and ulcers in the mouth and rashes on the hands and feet. The virus is usually transmitted through the digestive and respiratory systems or through intimate contact.
