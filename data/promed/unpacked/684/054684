What do an old pregnancy test for women and a mysterious fungus that
is killing frogs have in common?
Plenty, according to researchers at North-West University in South
Africa, who believe they have traced the spread of the killer fungus
to trade in the African clawed frog, used for decades in a bizarre
but effective way of determining pregnancy.
"We think we have traced the origin of the spread of the amphibian
chytrid fungus to the 'frog' pregnancy test for women, which was
widely used from the 1930s to the 1960s," said Che Weldon, a
zoologist at North-West University who has been researching the phenomenon.
That test involved taking the urine of a woman and injecting it into
an African clawed frog. If the woman was pregnant the hormones in her
urine would stimulate ovulation in the frog and it would spawn within
a matter of hours.
The species was exported to labs around the world in huge quantities
from South Africa from the 1930s -- the decade in which Weldon has
traced the first recorded case of the fungus by examining preserved
frogs in museum collections.
Some of the exported frogs were released or escaped into the wild
where it is believed they spread the fungus, which can move quickly
through a water system and can jump from one frog species to another.
The first case of the fungus recorded outside South Africa was in
1961 in Quebec, Canada. Adding weight to the case for an African
origin is the fact that the fungus is widespread in southern Africa
but frogs in the region appear to have developed a resistance to it.
However, it remains unclear if its roots are in southern Africa or
elsewhere on the continent.
"Frogs here for the most part are resistant to it. Some do succumb to
it but we have not witnessed the mass die-offs experienced
elsewhere," said Weldon.
The African clawed frog itself shows no clinical symptoms of the
disease, which means it is the perfect vector: a carrier which does
not die from the fungus. However, other species in southern Africa
are not resistant, although there are none of the die-offs recorded
in other parts of the world.
The clinical signs are obvious to experts: crazy frogs. "The symptoms
are neurological and seem to affect their behaviour," said Weldon.
River frogs, for example, are found far above the water level in
plants and even high up in trees. Nocturnal species come out in daylight.
"This river frog is infected. I picked it up a metre high in a fern,"
said North-West University zoologist Louis du Preez as he lifted the
lid of a plastic container to reveal a small, strikingly green frog.
Frogs infected with the fungus also display an excessive shedding of
their skin. The fungus is having a devastating impact on frog
populations around the world, lending a sense of urgency to the
research being done here.
"You have to go the origin of the disease. The idea of 'out of
Africa' is still a hypothesis but it has a lot of support," said du Preez.
Another team of researchers said in early January that the fungus had
been aggravated by global warming and has killed entire frog
populations in Central and South America. Du Preez said it had been
detected in the Americas, Africa, Australia and Europe but, so far, not Asia.
"It probably hasn't been found in Asia yet simply because scientists
have not made a concerted effort to find it there," he said. About
1/3 of the 5743 known species of frogs, toads and other amphibians
are classified as threatened, according to the Global Amphibian Assessment.
Up to 167 species may already be extinct and another 113 species have
not been seen in recent years. Habitat loss is a major threat but
species have also died off in pristine environments, pointing to
other causes such as the fungus.
"We fear that species are even being wiped out before they have been
described by science," said Du Preez.
The team is off this month to the Indian Ocean island of Madagascar
to see if the fungus is present there. Madagascar, famed for its
weird and wonderful wildlife, is home to about 250 frog species, all
but one of which are found nowhere else, according to du Preez.
The ecological stakes are high. "Amphibians are right in the centre
of the food chain. They keep insect numbers down and serve as food
themselves for many species, including wading birds, reptiles and
even fish," said Weldon. "If you remove that link you remove an
enormous flow of energy from the ecosystem," he said.

[An interesting hypothesis. But why did some develop resistance and
some did not? The factors playing into that may or may not shed more
light on this fungus. - Mod.TG]

The amphibian fungal disease chytridiomycosis is caused by the
zoosporic chytrid fungus _Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis_, originally
found causing mass mortality in wild frogs in Australia and Central
America in the late 1990s. It has been reported as the cause of
die-offs in Australia, New Zealand, Europe and North Central and
South America. It is the likely cause of a a number of species
extinctions in Australia and Latin America and is responsible for
so-called 'enigmatic population declines' in amphibians in these
regions. These declines are a major conservation issue and the focus
of a great deal of research.
The question of why the fungal agent simultaneously appeared in the
1990s on 2 different continents as a cause of declines may be
explained as observer bias, and it has now been shown that it
originally was associated with amphibian declines in the Western USA
in the 1970s. A review on this was published in Emerging Infectious
Diseases (EID) in 1999 (Daszak, P., L. Berger, A. A. Cunningham, A.
D. Hyatt, D. E. Green, and R. Speare. 1999. Emerging infectious
diseases and amphibian population declines. EID 5:735-748).
The evidence is pretty convincing that this is a global panzootic,
either spreading from a single source by introduction, or spreading
locally from multiple sources due to some factor such as climate
change or local environmental changes.
The African clawed frog / pregnancy testing hypothesis for how this
disease spread globally was originally published in EID (Weldon, C.,
L. H. du Preez, A. D. Hyatt, R. Muller, and R. Speare. 2004. Origin
of the amphibian chytrid fungus. EID 10:2100-2105). It's an
intriguing idea that is supported by 1) the finding that populations
of clawed frogs in the wild persist in the presence of this pathogen,
and 2) the timing of the development of this trade for pregnancy testing.
Others have cited the bullfrog (_Rana catesbeiana_) as a potential
source of spread. Bullfrogs can be infected with the pathogen, but
they're resistant to the disease. They are also widely farmed in
Latin America and Asia, and exported live around the world (including
into the USA) for the restaurant trade in frogs legs (Mazzoni, R et
al. 2003. Emerging pathogen of wild amphibians in frogs (_Rana
catesbeiana_) farmed for international trade. EID 9:995-998).
