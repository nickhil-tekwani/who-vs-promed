Health director-general Tan Sri Dr Mohd Ismail Marican said the chikungunya
epidemic registered a drop [this week] with 61 cases compared with 88 cases
the previous week [22-26 Jun 2009], but cases had risen in 5 states: Penang
(5 cases), Johor (2), and one in each of Selangor, Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya,
and Negeri Sembilan. The total number of chikungunya cases until now was
2836 cases compared with 4271 the year before [2008].

He said the Ministry of Health found that until 27 Jun 2009 there were 33
"hot areas" and only 11 localities were free of "hot areas" compared with
39 localities the previous week with 27 of them in Selangor, 5 in Kuala

[Apparently, a small outbreak of chikungunya virus transmission has been
occurring in Goa in 2009. It would be of interest to know if transmission
is continuing and if there have been new cases after May 2009.
