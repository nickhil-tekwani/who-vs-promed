Polio weekly global update - WHO
--------------------------------
As of: 20 Sep 2017

New wild poliovirus cases reported this week: 0
Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2017: 10
Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2016: 37

New cVDPV cases reported this week: 2
Total number of cVDPV cases in 2017: 49
Total number of cVDPV cases in 2016: 5

Headlines
- Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: Pakistan: one new wild poliovirus type one (WPV1) positive environmental sample; Syria: one new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) case; and, Democratic Republic of Congo: one new cVDPV2

Afghanistan
- No new wild poliovirus type one (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week [week of Sun 10 Sep 2017]. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 6. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on [Mon 10 Jul 2017], from Zabul province, neighbouring Kandahar province and Pakistan.
National immunisation days at the end of September [2017] will aim to vaccinate approximately 10 million children aged less than 5 years. Preparations continue to ensure the highest possible vaccination quality, with special focus on the highest risk regions.

Pakistan
- No new wild poliovirus type one (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The most recent case, from Karachi, had onset of paralysis on [11 Aug 2017]. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains four.
- One new WPV1-positive environmental sample has been reported in Jacobabad district, Sindh province, bringing the total WPV1 positives in 2017 to 76. This is the 1st WPV1-positive environmental to be detected in the Jacobadad district in 2017, and the 25th positive collected in Sindh since the beginning of the year.
- The National Immunization Days are in progress targeting more than 37 million children in the country.

Nigeria
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week [week of Sun 10 Sep 2017]. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016] in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno.
- Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016).
- Detection of polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.
- Planning is underway for the next set of subnational immunisation days, taking place at the beginning of October [2017]. The intention is to provide protection to over 50 percent of under 5s nationwide.
- The health response to widespread flooding in Benue continues to be strengthened by polio infrastructure. Existing structures and local health workers are helping to intensify disease surveillance and reporting, assess potential infection sources, and engage communities in disease prevention.
- In Borno, an emergency response team continues to use the polio infrastructure to monitor the recent cholera outbreak.

Lake Chad Basin
- The detection of wild poliovirus type one (WPV1) (Borno state, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto states in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence a regional outbreak response plan is being implemented.
- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.
- Detailed planning is underway for the next immunisation activities, scheduled for early October [2017].

Central Africa
- One new case of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) was reported in the past week [week of Sun 10 Sep 2017] in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). The case was found in a 17-month-old child, living in Lwamba , Haut Lomami. The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year is now 9, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (7 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on [Thu 27 Jul 2017]); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on [26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017], with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May [2017]).
- Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces.
- The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on [27-29 Jun 2017] in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from [13-15 Jul 2017] in Haut Lomami and [20-22 Jul 2017] in Maniema. Mop-up vaccination activities have gone ahead this week [week of Sun 17 Sep 2017], aiming to vaccinate over 120 000 under 5 years.
- The next immunisation activities are scheduled for October [2017].
- Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.

Middle East
- In Syria, one new type 2 circulating vaccine-derived polio (cVDPV2) case was reported from Mayadeen district, Deir-Ez-Zour governorate. This brings the total number of cases in this outbreak to 40. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between [3 Mar 2017 and 13 Jul 2017].
- The bulk of all cases are from Mayadeen, the epicentre of this outbreak.
- Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and does not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols.
- The 2nd immunization round for Deir-Ez-Zor was completed on [Mon 28 Aug 2017]. Monovalent OPV2 was provided for children between 0-59 months of age, and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) for children 2-23 months.

[Notable in this week's global update is that the only paralytic cases reported (2 - 1 in Syria previously reported in Poliomyelitis update (25): Syria (DY) 20170920.5329647 and another in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)) are related to circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV). but also notable is the isolation of a wild poliovirus (WPV) from an environmental sample in a geographic location that has not had WPV isolated previously this year (2017). With respect to the 2 cVDPV associated cases, the one in the DRC had date of onset [Thu 27 Jul 2017], and the one in Deir al-Zour Syria had date of onset [Mon 19 Jun 2017] both somewhat early with respect to implementation of control measures.

With respect to the WPV isolation from an environmental sample, Jacobadabad is located in Sindh province, approximately 404 kms (251 miles) from Karachi, where the most recent WPV1 associated paralytic case occurred with onset on [Fri 11 Aug 2017] (see Poliomyelitis update (24): Pakistan (KR) global 20170906.5298853), suggesting there is still ongoing circulation of the WPV1 in Sindh province.
