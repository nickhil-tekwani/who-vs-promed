Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection:
- swill feeding,
- contact with wild species,
- transboundary migration of wild boars from the Chechen Republic and
Georgia to the territory of North Ossetia[-Alania], and, for the
Orenburg event, feeding with food waste which may have come from
Transcaucasia/North Caucasus.

Epidemiological comments
In this region, swine are kept on a free-range basis.
Domestic pigs are largely in contact with wild boars; swine and wild
boars crossbreeding is observed.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine, movement control inside the country,
screening, vaccination prohibited, no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: stamping out, disinfection of infected
premises/establishment(s)

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Federal Scientific Institution, All-Russia
Scientific Institute of Veterinary Virology and Microbiology, Pokrov
(national laboratory)
Tests and results:

[Though procedurally the Russian follow-up report above is a routine
one, de facto this is not the case: among the 8 reported outbreaks, 2
are located in territories hitherto not reported as ASF-infected. The
odd case in the Republic of Ingushetia (outbreak 1), involving a
single swine boar, is not surprising, appearing in a territory
enclosed between infected areas (Chechnya and North Ossetia-Alania;
see map at
<http://www.colorado.edu/ibs/waroutcomes/pics/ethnicMap.jpg>).

On the other hand, the discovery of the 2nd newly-infected territory
(outbreak 2), namely in Orenburg province, is in fact a most
significant event, since this location is more than 1000 km (621 mi)
northeast of the hitherto infected area. This leap, which --
according to the Russian report -- may be explained by the "feeding
(of domestic pigs) with food waste that may have come from
Transcaucasia/North Caucasus," may herald a further spread of ASF
eastwards, a matter for grave concern. - Mod.AS]

An outbreak of the African swine fever virus in Russia's North
Caucasus republic of North Ossetia[-Alania] has so far killed 1076
pigs, the regional emergency service said on Wednesday [30 Jul 2008].
"A total of 27 pigs have died in the past 24 hours," the statement
said.

The outbreak was registered on 30 Jun 2008, and more than 3400 pigs
have been culled since. A total of 7500 potentially infected animals
have yet to be put down.

Preliminary reports said that the infection may have been brought in
by wild pigs. The virus can survive for up to 15 weeks in raw pork
and up to 6 months in processed meat. The virus, which causes lethal
hemorrhagic disease in pigs, does not pose a threat to humans.

Personnel have been deployed to guard the province's border to ensure
that no pork products are taken out of North Ossetia[-Alania], which
has approximately 115 000 domestic pigs.
