[As stated in the preceding post on hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
(Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome - USA (Utah) (03) 20020609.4446), the number
and frequency of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome case reports in the USA are
increasing. Therefore, from now on such reports will be combined as periodic
(probably weekly) updates, except when the report originates from a state or
geographical region where the disease has not been reported previously or
has some other special significance. - Mod.CP]
In these updates:
[1] Utah - Fourth case
[2] Idaho - Fatal case

Fourth and Youngest Case of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome in Utah
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Health officials in the eastern half of the state are investigating Utah's
youngest case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome: an infected 17-year-old from
Duchesne County. The teen was infected during the past week and a half, said
his doctor, Mark Mitchell of Roosevelt. The unidentified boy appears to be
improving. Mitchell said the boy was reported in serious condition on Wed 26
Jun 2002 at Provo's Utah Valley Regional Hospital, where he was taken on
Sunday morning after being treated at the Roosevelt-based Uintah Basin
Hospital. Utah's youngest previous hantavirus case was a 19-year-old patient
in 1994, said the state Department of Health. In this latest case, a chest
X-ray confirmed the teen had a life-threatening respiratory infection; later
blood tests confirmed a hantavirus infection.
Joseph Shaffer, director of the TriCounty Health Department, said the cause
[source] of the infection is still unknown. An investigation is under way to
determine if the teen was exposed to rodent droppings recently or got the
disease through some other means. Information from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention says hantavirus is usually dusted on humans through
rodent feces or urine that becomes airborne --- often in confined spaces
such as sheds, crawl spaces or garages --- and then inhaled. Patients can
also catch the virus by touching their nose or mouth after handling
hantavirus-contaminated materials. Symptoms include fever, chills, headache,
muscle aches and occasionally nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.
Utah has recorded 4 hantavirus pulmonary syndrome cases so far this year. In
early May, a 41-year-old Cedar City woman died 5 hours after being admitted
to a hospital with flu-like symptoms. Two non-fatal hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome cases this year were reported in Salt Lake and Wayne counties, the
state health department said.

Idaho: Hantavirus Kills Pest Control Employee
---------------------------------------------
A 37-year-old pest control worker died from hantavirus infection on Mon 24
Jun 2002 in Boise's St. Luke's Regional Medical Center after apparently
being exposed to infected rodents in his work or at home, said officials
with South Central District Health in Twin Falls.
Deer mice or cotton rats usually carry hantaviruses. [The probable
infectious agent in this case is _Sin Nombre virus_, whose reservoir host is
the deer mouse _Peromyscus maniculatus_. - Mod.CP]. Health District
spokeswoman Cheryle Becker said the man was a permanent resident of Valley
County. Becker said an investigation is under way to try to determine where
the victim might have been exposed to the disease.
A total of 17 hantavirus cases have been reported in Idaho in 24 years, 6 of
them fatal. Transmission of the disease usually occurs when a person
disturbs areas contaminated with rodent droppings or nesting materials and
inhales the dust.
