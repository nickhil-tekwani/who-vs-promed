I am reluctant to seem to be querying moderators of this list who do such
good work. I make no claims to specific expertise in this area [HFRS.
But, I think if problems are reported as being unusually high by our
colleagues we should accept it first and question it second. My experience
in Mongolia suggests that when people record an increase in disease, the
lack of ability to judge this in objective terms is mainly due to
previously imperfect records.
The Moderator made a point in his comments about rodent numbers being
related high crop levels. Again, I am no expert, but ecologists I know
have strongly linked high rodent populations to a lack of cultivation and
tall tillage. I have certainly walked over billiard table surfaced
grasslands and had difficulties avoiding rodent/vole (_Microtus_ sp.?). I
think we should be very cautious about associating rodent populations and
agricultural intensity and or productivity. The relationship may be
opposite to our a priori thoughts and possibly unrelated to what any theory
so far suggests. I would welcome comments to the news list on populations
of rodents in central Asia and grassland condition from ecologists and
mammalogists.

[It is logical to think that when rodents have access to more food there
will soon be more rodents, but I do not know that that is the case. Is
there anyone out there willing to share with us data on this situation
(i.e., relationship of forage quantity to rodent populations)? - Mod.CHC
