Outbreak of Campylobacter Enteritis Associated with Cross-Contamination of
Food - Oklahoma, 1996
On August 29, 1996, the Jackson County Health Department (JCHD) in
southwestern Oklahoma notified the Oklahoma State Department of Health
(OSDH) of a cluster of _Campylobacter jejuni_ infections that occurred
during August 16-20 among persons who had eaten lunch at a local restaurant
on August 15. This report summarizes the investigation of these cases and
indicates that _C. jejuni_ infection was most likely acquired from eating
lettuce cross-contaminated with raw chicken. This report also emphasizes
the need to keep certain foods and cooking utensils separate during food
handling.
MMWR Editorial Note: _Campylobacter_ is one of the most common causes of
foodborne disease in the United States, causing approximately 2 million
cases of gastroenteritis each year. Illness associated with _Campylobacter_
infection is usually mild, but can be severe and even fatal. Although it
did not occur in this outbreak, Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS), a
demyelinating disorder resulting in acute neuromuscular paralysis, is a
serious sequela of _Campylobacter_ infection. Up to 40% of patients with
GBS have evidence of _Campylobacter_ infection before onset of symptoms.
Most illnesses associated with _Campylobacter_ infections are sporadic.
Common source outbreaks occur, and most have been traced to unpasteurized
milk and contaminated drinking water. In comparison, most sporadic cases,
and those in this outbreak, are associated with improper handling and
preparing of poultry.
_Campylobacter_ has been found in up to 88% of broiler chicken carcasses in
the United States. The infectious dose of _Campylobacter_ is low; ingestion
of only 500 organisms, easily present in one drop of raw chicken juice, can
result in human illness. Therefore, contamination of foods by raw chicken
is an efficient mechanism for transmission of this organism. Restaurants
provide opportunities for outbreaks of foodborne disease because large
quantities of different foods are handled in the same kitchen. Failure to
wash hands, utensils, or countertops can lead to contamination of foods
that will not be cooked. The food handler involved in this outbreak had not
received training in food safety. The Food and Drug Administration has
developed guidelines for food handlers to prevent cross-contamination of
foods; however, states are not required to adopt these guidelines.
Laws mandating certification of food-service employees differ by state.
Twelve states have requirements for certification of food-service managers
in all jurisdictions, 21 states have requirements in some jurisdictions,
and 17 states have no requirements. Of 33 states for which information is
available, only two have statewide requirements for training of food
handlers. States can reduce the risk for foodborne illness in restaurants
by ensuring that restaurant employees receive training in food safety.
