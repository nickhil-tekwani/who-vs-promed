About 1000 pigs are to be slaughtered in the Lazio region after 2 pigs tested positive for African swine fever (ASF) on a small family farm in the Rome area.

The 2 infected pigs were killed immediately, along with 7 others on the farm, as veterinary authorities prepare to slaughter all pigs within a 10-km [6.2 mi] radius of the site, an estimated 1000 animals.

Angelo Ferrari, the government's special commissioner in charge of tackling swine fever, has also ordered the culling of "at least" 400 wild boar in the Lazio region around Rome, reports state broadcaster RAI.

In early May [2022] ASF was detected in wild boar in the city's northern Insugherata nature reserve, prompting authorities to ban picnics and seal off bins in a "red zone", covering a large area of north and north-west Rome.

The cull, scheduled to take place within 30 days, will see 200 wild boar killed in the "protected regional areas" and 200 killed "outside these areas", reports news agency ANSA.

The city's Grande Raccordo Anulare ringroad is also set to be fenced off in the coming days, according to RAI.

ASF, a highly contagious viral disease, is fatal to pigs and wild hogs but is not transmitted to humans.

Italian farmers have long called for the culling of wild boar whose population in the Rome area has risen to more than 20 000.

Italy's farming groups describe the passing of ASF from wild boar to pigs as a "disaster that was waiting to happen", amid growing concerns for Italy's Euro 8 billion [USD 8.42 billion] pork sector which employs around 50 000 people.

The detection of ASF in Rome follows an isolated outbreak of the disease earlier this year [2022] in the northwest Italian regions of Liguria and Piemonte where containment measures are also underway.

However, unlike Lazio, the cases of ASF in Liguria and Piemonte have so far only affected wild boar -- 144 cases according to the last update -- and not [domestic] pigs.

A thousand pigs will be slaughtered after 2 cases of African swine fever [ASF] were detected on a farm in Rome's Lazio region, officials said Friday [10 Jun 2022], spurring fears of a blow to the country's pork industry.

"We have to slaughter all the pigs in the contaminated area very quickly," Angelo Ferrari, tasked with managing the crisis, told AGI news agency.

The local health agency estimated 1000 pigs would have to be culled to stem the spread, he said.

"The sooner we act decisively and incisively, the greater our hope that the commercial damage will be reduced," he said.

Italy, with about 8.9 million pigs, is the 7th biggest pork producer in the European Union, representing an 8-billion-euro (USD 8.4 billion) industry, according to the agricultural association Confagricoltura.

The 2 cases of ASF detected in Lazio are the first among farmed pigs in Italy. Before that, cases were detected in wild boar in January [2022] in northern Italy, then in the Lazio region.

African swine fever (ASF) does not affect humans but is contagious and fatal for pigs and their wild relatives and an outbreak is potentially devastating for the pork industry, experts say.

A 2018 outbreak in China -- the world's largest pork producer -- caused millions of pigs to be slaughtered to stop the spread.

The disease has existed in Africa for decades. In a [3 Dec 2021] report on the virus, the World Organisation for Animal Health [OIE, now WOAH] said ASF had been reported in 32 countries in 5 world regions since January 2020.

In Italy, it has been endemic on the island of Sardinia since first appearing in 1978.

In western Europe, the virus was reported in Belgium in 2018, prompting China to ban all imports of Belgian pork.

After Germany confirmed its 1st case in a dead wild boar in 2020, China, Japan and South Korea, alongside Brazil and Argentina, also suspended German pork imports.

Italy's main agricultural association Coldiretti called on the government last month [May 2022] for the "rapid culling" of boars throughout the country to help stop the spread of the disease.

Images of boar walking through residential areas of Rome and feeding at overflowing rubbish bins regularly do the rounds on social media networks.

[For a detailed, richly illustrated review of the clinical presentation and postmortem findings of ASF, subscribers are referred to pages 17-22 of FAO's 'ASF Manual for Veterinarians: Detection and Diagnosis' (ISSN 1810-1119), available at https://www.fao.org/3/i7228e/i7228e.pdf. Pages 23-28 address Differential Diagnosis, similarly well illustrated.

So far, no commercial vaccine against ASF has become available. Efforts to develop such a vaccine have been undertaken, leading to recent preliminary clinical trials (https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/vietnam-develops-worlds-first-african-swine-fever-vaccine-commercial-use-2022-06-01/). - Mod.AS
