The provincial health office in Laguna said 2 children succumbed to Japanese encephalitis, the 1st confirmed cases of the mosquito-borne disease in the Southern Tagalog province this year [2017].

On [Tue 29 Aug 2017], Dr Rene Bagamasbad, Laguna health officer, said the victims were a 9-year-old boy in Calauan town and a 6-year-old boy in San Pablo City. He said the children died around 2 weeks ago.

Calauan and San Pablo City, being adjacent to each other, were also placed under investigation by the health office.

Only the Calauan case has so far reached the Calabarzon office of the Department of Health, according to Dr Rio Magpantay, DOH regional director.

The regional office, however, had also started monitoring "signs and symptoms" of possible Japanese encephalitis incidence in other parts of Laguna.

Calabarzon stands for the provinces of Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, and Quezon.

The disease, which is transmitted by the _Culex_ mosquito, commonly causes abdominal pains, fever, and seizures. It may also cause a part of the brain to swell.

Vaccines are available. But there is no cure yet for the disease. Vaccines are currently not part of the government's immunization program.

Magpantay said there was no declaration of an outbreak. But the DOH regional office would strengthen the surveillance of communities and hospitals.

It usually takes some time to confirm a case of Japanese encephalitis because specimens, such as the patient's blood sample, would have to be collected and submitted for testing at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in Muntinlupa in Metro Manila.

[There have been relatively few reports of human Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases in the Philippines in recent years, although the islands are within the JE virus endemic zone. The report above is of 2 cases. Also on Luzon Island this year (2017), the Department of Health (DOH) has recorded a total of 149 cases of JE with at least 22 cases in noted Pampanga, the highest in the Central Luzon region (see Japanese encephalitis - Philippines: (PM) 20170818.5257940).

A report from the World Health Organization (WHO) said that JE is an illness that is endemic in the Philippines and is fatal in almost 3 out of 10 serious cases. The report also said that nearly all survivors of this mosquito-borne disease experience permanent damage, including physical disabilities, cognitive and language problems, learning disabilities and behavioral problems.
