TAMPA (South Florida) - A potentially fatal and highly contagious virus
that causes vomiting and diarrhea in dogs is affecting more of the city's
animals, according to some veterinary clinics. And the virus, which strikes
mostly young dogs, may spread more rapidly this summer, according to the
animal caregivers.
"I think we definitely have seen more (cases) in the last two to three
weeks," said Terry Besnier, emergency supervisor at Florida Veterinary
Specialists, which operates a 24-hour clinic in Tampa. "And the emergency
clinics are the ones that tend to get more of the weekend cases. So if
we're seeing more here, then the regular practices probably are also."
Parvovirus attacks the lining of the digestive system. It prevents dogs and
puppies from being able to absorb nutrients or liquids. Dogs with the virus
often have diarrhea, vomiting and become lethargic. They usually stop
eating and develop a foul-smelling, liquid stool that may contain blood.
Parvovirus can pass from dog to dog through infected feces. The virus,
typically not harmful to humans, can be spread by people to animals. "You
can pet a dog that is carrying this and go back to your home and it's on
you," said Rick Chaboudy, executive director of the Humane Society of North
Pinellas. "That's how it is spread - from a dog to a person to another
dog."
The virus is particularly dangerous because it can linger for six months or
more in the environment.
A vaccine exists for parvovirus, but the recent rise in cases may be traced
back to last Christmas season when many families got puppies as family
gifts but failed to get the proper vaccinations for these dogs. The Humane
Society of North Pinellas has seen about 30 cases of parvovirus this year,
most of them in May. Although the number of parvovirus cases has not been
enough to raise red flags, Chaboudy said, the humane society is always on
the lookout for the virus. "It's probably a shelter's worse nightmare," he
said. "It can spread very quickly. It is extremely deadly to puppies and
that's where we have a tendency to see it."
