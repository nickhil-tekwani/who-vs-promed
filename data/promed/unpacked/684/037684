[This is now the 5th laboratory-confirmed case of MERS-CoV reported by Saudi Arabia in the past 7 days. Since the beginning of September 2014, there have been 8 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 1 death reported by the Saudi MOH. The 8 cases this month (September 2014) have included 3 from Taif, 3 from Riyadh, 1 from Najran, and 1 from Jubail. The most recent case reported from Taif (MERS-CoV (17): Saudi Arabia, new case, retrospective revision of case count 20140919.2788385), and the case from Riyadh reported today (21 Sep 2014) both had a history of exposure to animals.

After a significant decrease in reporting of laboratory-confirmed cases during the months of July and August 2014, it appears as though there is now a renewed cycle of transmission of MERS-CoV ongoing now in Saudi Arabia -- a cause for concern with the upcoming Haj period in the next few weeks when there will be millions of pilgrims visiting Saudi Arabia.
