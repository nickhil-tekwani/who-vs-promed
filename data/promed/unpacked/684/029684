One person has died and 35 others are admitted at Kericho County Referral Hospital in a suspected case of food poisoning. The county executive for Health Services, Mr Barnabas Ngeno, said 4 of the patients are in critical condition while 31 others are under observation. Doctors said one patient succumbed while receiving treatment on Monday [23 Aug 2021].

Those admitted are reported to have bought uninspected meat from a villager who slaughtered a goat that was suspected to be sick. The incident that happened in Kapkikoro, Sigowet Soin Constituency.

"Those who ate the meat complained of stomach pains, vomiting, and diarrhea before they were rushed to hospital for treatment," said Dr Japheth Cheruiyot. An ambulance was then dispatched by county authorities to the village to transport sick villagers to hospital.

Dr Cheruiyot said samples have been taken from the victims for further laboratory tests to establish the exact cause of their sickness as they undergo treatment.

Kericho Governor Prof Paul Chepkwony called for calm, saying doctors were working round the clock to ensure the patients are given the best medical attention. "I wish to condole with the bereaved family and appeal to residents of Kericho County to always buy meat from licensed butcheries to avoid such cases from happening," he said.

The etiology of the gastrointestinal illness here is not clear. Gastrointestinal anthrax is a possibility unless the illnesses began shortly after the meat was ingested.

Abstract
----------
"Background: _Bacillus anthracis_ may usually cause 3 forms of anthrax: inhalation, gastrointestinal, and cutaneous. The gastrointestinal (GI) anthrax develops after eating contaminated meat. Thus, in this paper we report 5 cases of intestinal anthrax.

"Case presentation: We report a case series of intestinal anthrax, with history of consumption of raw or poorly cooked liver of sheep. One patient was female and 4 were males with the age range between 17 and 26 years. All patients were admitted with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Examination revealed abdominal distention on the right lower quadrant or diffuse tenderness. Laboratory examination in all patients showed leukocytosis with polymorphonuclear of greater than 80%. Because of the unclear and questionable diagnosis, exploratory laparotomy was performed on several patients, invariably showing an abundant yellowish and thick ascitic fluid, soft hypertrophied mesenteric lymph nodes (3-5 cm) mostly in the ileocecal region, and substantial edema involving one segment of small bowel, cecum, or ascending colon. Anthrax was diagnosed on the epidemiologic basis (ingestion history of half-cooked liver of sheep) or microbiologic (microscopy with bacterial culture) and pathologic testing (post-surgery in 4 patients or autopsy in one patient). With appropriate treatment, 4 survived and one patient died.

"Conclusion: Gastrointestinal anthrax is characterized by rapid onset, fever, ascitis, and septicemia. The symptoms can mimic those seen in an acute surgical abdomen. Rapid diagnosis and prompt initiation of antibiotic therapy and then exploratory laparotomy (right hemicolectomy) are keys to survival."

Kericho County is one of the counties of the republic of Kenya located in the west central part of the country. - Mod. LL]

[Gastrointestinal anthrax should certainly be considered. While it responds to antibiotics, it is VERY important to drain the abdominal cavity of any bloody fluid, which would contain the anthrax toxins. Human anthrax cases resulting from the slaughter and butchering of sick or dead animals will always have cutaneous cases among the butchering and cooking crews. The incubation period is a function of dose, the higher the dose, the shorter the period, which can result in acute deaths in a matter of hours. One of the public health problems with GI anthrax is that mild cases result in the production of antibodies, which will protect in subsequent exposures and a reduction in the public awareness of the real risk from eating meat from sick & dead animals. - ModMHJ
