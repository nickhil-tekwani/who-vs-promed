The Taiz Governorate has been hit hard by a recent outbreak of dengue
fever, with Al-Jumhoori Hospital reporting up to 525 cases in the
past 3 months alone.

Dengue fever can be tested for by 2 methods, the test cassette and
the ELISA Test, according to Dr. Ahmed Abddulaah Mansur, Chairman of
Virology Department at Al-Jumhoori Hospital. However, the
availability of such methods is reportedly inadequate. "The ELISA
Test is available only at the Aljumhuri Hospital, where cases are
referred to from all other private or public hospitals and
laboratories," Mansur said.

Other private labs have also reported scores of cases, with Alameri
Laboratory reporting 5 this month [December 2008] alone.

"Since there is a shortage of test equipment, we cannot effectively
diagnose patients, as most cases are identified through a general
blood test," said Dr. Waleed Yasin, a lab technician.

Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne infection that can take one of 2
forms: Dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). These
have both affected the rural areas in Taiz, including in Alshrooh
Village in Jabal Habashi District.

The main reasons for the spread of this infectious disease are
stagnant water, open-liquid containers, and rainfall in areas where
mosquitoes breed.

Symptoms of the disease include severe headaches, rashes, muscular
pain, joint pain, back and even eye pain.

Mansur said that to help combat the spread of the disease in areas
where it is endemic, the authorities concerned should raise awareness
on how to take preventative measures.

In June 2008, among the provinces hit by dengue fever was the eastern
province of Shabwa, contributing to more than 2000 cases of infection
and tens of deaths.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the epidemic also
took hold in the western province of Hodeidah in 2005, resulting in a
total of 392 cases of infection and 15 deaths.

A total of 1273 cases of dengue fever, including 3 deaths, were
reported between 30 Nov and 6 Dec [2008], making it the week with the
highest dengue cases reported so far this year.

Most of the cases were recorded in Selangor, totaling 640, followed
by Johor (102), Kedah (65), Sarawak (50), Pahang (42), Kelantan (31),
Sabah (23) and 13 each in Perlis and Putrajaya.

The Health Ministry's disease control director, Datuk Dr Hassan Abdul
Rahman, in a statement issued here Tuesday [16 Dec 2008], said that
this brings the number of cases due to dengue fever reported so far
this year [2008] to 44 494, including 98 deaths. He said last week's
increase in dengue cases was due to, among others things, the rainy
weather and the public's lackadaisical attitude in keeping their
premises and surroundings free of _Aedes_ mosquito breeding grounds.

He said that of the 969 premises inspected by health officials, 81
percent of them were found to contain breeding grounds for _Aedes_
mosquitoes, adding that a total of 45 compound notices, involving
fines of RM 12 650 [USD 3329], and 78 notices to clean up had been
issued.

[This report underscores the challenges that health officials face in
trying to get citizens to take seriously the elimination of _Aedes_
mosquito breeding sites, even when substantial fines are involved for
non-compliance. Dengue has occurred in many of the same Malaysian
states where chikungunya virus transmission has been going on as well
(see ProMED archive no. 20081222.4028). _Aedes_ mosquitoes are
vectors of all 4 dengue virus serotypes and of chikungunya viruses.

As of November 2008, Indonesia had recorded 101 646 cases of dengue
fever this year [2008], a surprising 32 percent decrease from 149 321
cases in the same period last year, according to the Health Ministry.

The incidence rate of the disease, which is typical for tropical
urban areas, has thus also declined to about 44 cases per 100 000
people this year [2008] from 72 cases per 100 000 people in 2007,
while the case fatality ratio has dropped slightly to 0.73 percent
from one percent last year [2007].

This decline, if it is correct and continues until the end of the
year [2008], will be the 1st drop after 5 consecutive years of rises
in the number of cases. Overall, Indonesia has been experiencing an
almost consistently rising trend in dengue fever infections since
they were 1st recorded in 1968, when the case fatality ratio was
still as high as 40 percent.

With the number of cases usually reaching its peak between January
and March, it is likely the 2008 figure for dengue fever cases will
indeed end up being lower than last year's [2007].

The government claims that the drop in dengue fever cases this year
[2008] is a consequence of its anticipative measures, which include
improving epidemiological surveillance, improving the quality of
dengue services management, intensifying vector control and providing
quick responses to "extraordinary occurrence" cases.

But Pandu Riono of the IDI said the drop was very probably due to the
cycle in the population growth of _Aedes aegypti_, the mosquito that
is the species vector of dengue fever [virus].

During the past 40 years, in about every decade showing a rising
trend in cases, there has always been one year with a significant
drop.

If this drop is indeed part of this cycle, then next year [2009]
Indonesia will likely see another rise in infections.

As well as the disease's cyclic pattern, the threat of global warming
could also boost the number of dengue fever cases in the future, as
vector mosquitoes will be able to expand their territory to the
highlands, which were once too cool for them to survive but are now
growing warmer.

Former director general for disease control at the Health Ministry, I
Nyoman Kandun, said early this year [2008] that the temperature
increases could shorten the incubation period of the dengue virus in
the bodies of both mosquitoes and humans. This could subsequently
lead to more vector mosquitoes and, hence, more dengue fever cases.

[Perhaps the previous outbreaks of the same dengue virus serotypes
circulating currently have provided significant "herd immunity" in
the population. It would be of considerable interest to know the
extent to which vector mosquito control efforts have reduced _Aedes_
populations. Although higher ambient temperatures mentioned above
might shorten the dengue virus extrinsic incubation period (the time
from ingestion of the virus until it reaches the salivary glands and
can be transmitted) in mosquitoes, it is unlikely to affect the
incubation period in humans.

An outbreak of dengue fever in Cairns, in far north Queensland,
continues to cause alarm, as the number now affected has reportedly
reached 50 and appears to be rising.

Queensland Health says another 12 people are awaiting blood test
results, and 6 people have been admitted to hospital.

Worse hit suburbs for the mosquito-borne disease are North Cairns,
Parramatta Park and Whitfield, and Dr. Jeffrey Hannah from the
Tropical Population Health Service is urging those who become sick to
see their doctor. Some northern beaches suburbs are also affected,
and it is suspected that the outbreak is spreading to other suburbs.

Dr. Hannah says typical symptoms are the sudden onset of a high
fever, very unpleasant headache, profound lethargy, muscle aches and
pains and a rash, and suspected carriers who fail to seek medical
advice could spread the disease wherever they went.

Authorities are monitoring several more suburbs close to the infected
zones or where properties are conducive to breeding dengue mosquitoes.

The public in all suburbs is being warned to clear stagnant water in
potted plants, car tires, palm fronds and any other containers; to
use insect repellent, to wear personal repellent during the day, and
re-apply it according to the label, and to use plug-in mosquito
zappers; and also to use cockroach surface spray under tables, chairs
and beds in the home.

A severe strain [syndrome] known as dengue hemorrhagic fever can be fatal.

American Samoa Gov. Togiola Tulafono tomorrow [22 Dec 2008] will
convene a meeting of key government officials to discuss coordinated
action to control dengue fever in the territory, the Samoa News
reports.

There have been 602 confirmed cases of dengue in American Samoa to date.

"This is a very big effort for us, and everyone's participation is
needed to wipe out this disease. It will be proposed to the governor
at this meeting to declare January [2009] as dengue fever island wide
prevention, said Dr. Ivan Tuliau, the territorial medical director.

The report said the LBJ Medical Center's chief medical officer,
Taulapapa Dr. Aloiamoa Anesi, has described American Samoa's current
dengue fever problem as a "critical public health issue."

Health authorities here are warning of an increase in the incidence
of dengue fever, with over a dozen persons now being treated for the
fatal form of the disease, known as dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF].

Chief Medical Officer Dr Josiah Rambally said that so far this year
[2008], St Lucia had nearly doubled the number of cases reported last
year, adding that the only comfort was the fact that there were no
fatalities.

He told reporters that up until the end of November [2008], there
were some 97 confirmed cases of dengue here, compared to 52 recorded
for the corresponding period last year [2007].

"We suspect that the increase this year [2008] is the result of the
additional rain we have had and an improved system of surveillance,
where we have done a better job of detecting persons infected with
the disease," he said.

The health official is also urging citizens to eliminate the breeding
grounds of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, which carries the virus that
is associated with flu-like symptoms.
