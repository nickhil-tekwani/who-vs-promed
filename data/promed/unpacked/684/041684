MECHANICAL TRANSMISSION BY MOSQUITOES (4)
=========================================
{see also EBOLA (1-9); EBOLA TRANSMISSION (4-7)-- Mod.}
A few comments addressed to the refreshing time-warp segment of ProMED:
(1) The search for a socially acceptable alternative mechanism for
transmission of HIV continues unabated. This is at least the third re-
cycling of mosquitoes as vectors.
I concur absolutely with the consensus that maintains that mechanical
transmission of HIV by mosquitoes does not occur and, if it did, it would be
completely irrelevant to to the epidemiology of the disease. However I
cannot agree with the frequently expressed denigration of mechanical
transmission of viruses by mosquitoes. In fact several billion rabbits dead
of myxomatosis attest to the efficiency of this mode of transfer. Firstly,
and this has already been addressed to some extent, the mosquito proboscis is
not a hypodermic needle; it is an exquisitely complex bundle of paired and
individual processes acting in concert to cut and pierce skin and tissue, as
well as blood vessel and capillary walls while intermittently injecting
saliva containing anticoagulants into tissues and blood. The volume of
ingested blood is small so that even an arbovirus, which will replicate in
the mosquito, needs to be in reasonably high concentration in the blood to
infect the mosquito for subsequent "biological" transmission. Presumably even
higher concentrations of virus are required for "mechanical" transmission
from the smidgeon of blood contaminating the external surfaces of the
proboscis. Nevertheless, it has been demonstrated in laboratory
"interrupted feeding" experiments that mechanical transmission of arboviruses
does occur, but this is surely incidental to "biological transmission", the
defining property of all arboviruses. Maybe in the field this will
occasionally extend transmission to an otherwise non-vector mosquito but it is
fundamentally irrelevant.
Secondly and critically, THE KEY TO THE HIGHLY EFFICIENT MECHANICAL
TRANSMISSION OF MYXOMA VIRUS BY MOSQUITOES IS NOT VIREMIA BUT THE HIGH
CONCENTRATION OF VIRUS IN CELLS OF THE SKIN AND THE UNDERLYING TUMOUR. While
the mosquito is seeking blood in the vascularised tumours the somewhat
serrated maxillary stylets "offer greatest opportunity for lodgment of virus
particles in a position from which they could be dislodged on subsequent
probing" (Day et al J. Hyg. Camb.1956 54:250 et seq.). At rest in the
labial sheath the stylets are bathed in protein-rich fluid, so virus is
incidentally protected to some extent from direct exposure to the elements,
and poxviruses are notoriously tough anyway. This mode of transmission
applies to both |Sylvilagus| rabbits of the Americas in which infection is
benign, and |Oryctolagus cuniculus|, the wild rabbit of Europe and north
Africa, in which infection is commonly fatal. In both species mosquito
transmission continues for days or weeks after viraemia has disappeared. (In
|O.cuniculus|, and probably in |Sylvilagus| spp the virus is also transmitted
by fleas, other skin piercing insects, thistle spines, blackberry thorns
etc). In repeated experiments carried out in rabbits at the height of
viraemia, mosquitoes fed on ear veins remote from tumours failed to transmit
virus immediately and at intervals up to six weeks later, whereas ca. 90% of
those that fed at the same time through tumours on the flanks of the same
rabbits transmitted immediately and at gradually declining rates over the
period of the experiments. Fowlpox virus is also transmitted in this way and
it seems likely that mechanical transfer of virus from skin and tissue but
not from blood is or was a major or subsidiary mode of transmission for all
poxviruses, extant or extinct.
So it is not surprising that mosquitoes do not mechanically transmit HIV
from viraemic patients. Indeed, are there any viruses of vertebrates, apart
from arboviruses, which have been shown to be transmitted mechanically by
blood contaminating the proboscis of mosquitoes that have fed through normal
skin? (I accept that pool-feeding tabanids etc. are far more likely to be
successful).
(2) Myxomatosis is a classic example of a new disease imposed on a huge
naive mammal population, and perhaps there are aspects of this event which
are pertinent to recent "new" diseases. An example from Ebola postings.
*Thou shall not kill thy reservoir host*. During the 46 years that
myxoma virus has been circulating in Australia, |O. cuniculus|, (the European
wild rabbit imported to Australia and elsewhere), has been both the sole
reservoir host and, except for the occasional hare (|Lepus europaeus|), the
only species infected by the virus. The slaughter of the reservoir host has
been prodigious, but so is the reproductive capacity of that host. Many
rabbits still die of the disease but it seems that a somewhat more stable
host-parasite relationship is developing.
In contrast there are 12-13 species of |Sylvilagus|, the natural host
species in the Americas, but only 3 of these are known support myxoma-fibroma
viruses. |S. floridanus| (cottontail) in eastern USA and South America hosts
Shope's fibroma virus, which is benign in |O. cuniculus| and has been used as
a vaccine against myxomatosis. |S. braziliensis| (tapeti) hosts the South and
Central American types of myxoma, and |S. bachmani|, (brush rabbit), the
Californian myxoma virus. All myxoma/fibroma viruses are benign in their
specific |Sylvilagus| hosts and are transmitted mechanically by mosquitoes.
There is an extraordinary degree of specificity between each virus type and
its individual host; even other |Sylvilagus| spp sharing the habitat with the
brush rabbit seem not to be naturally infected. The only exceptions detected
so far are South American type virus in North American |S.audabonii|
and |S.nuttallii|. Despite this species specificity, all 3 types of myxoma
virus cross a "genus barrier" and are highly lethal in |O. cuniculus|.
Strains of South American type myxoma were introduced to |O. cuniculus| in
Australia and Europe; florid protuberant tumours at low passage and initially
very highly lethal in about 12 days. In |Oryctolagus| the Californian virus
produces flat pale lesions, mild signs, neuronal involvement, and early
death, and the Central American type seems a to be a stable mix of the other
2 types at both molecular and biological levels.
So in the Americas there is a climax association of host and parasite in
which, except for a few unsightly non-persistent tumours, there appears to be
no inconvenience to the reservoir host nor any threat to the continued
existence of the parasite. Although unrecognisable alonside wild |O.
cuniculus|, commercial breeds of rabbits world-wide are all derived from this
genetic stock and periodically myxoma virus in the Americas will be carried by
mosquito from brush rabbits or tapetis and cause devastating epizootics in
commercial and laboratory colonies or in isolated groups of pet rabbits which
are situated within mosquito range of appropriate |Sylvilagus| spp. Same
virus, different rabbit, different disease and, in the Americas, there is
conformity to the commandment *Thou shall not kill thy reservoir host*.
Whether or not a new virus will wipe out or eventually live in harmony
with its naive vertebrate hosts will presumably depend on the initial and
continuing lethality of the virus for that host, the initial size and
distribution of the host population, the genetic diversity in host and virus
populations (utmost importance), the reproductive capacity of the host and
all that that implies (e.g., litter size and number of litters per season,
age at puberty, longevity, etc.), the efficiency of transmission of the
virus, and, as a sop to |Homo sapiens|, the ability to artificially combat
the disease.
(3) Yellow fever in India/Asia is past the use-by date but did you know that
dengue-infected |Aedes aegypti| cannot be superinfected with YF virus (Sabin,
c. 1955)! About the same year one raison d'etre for the establishment of
the Rockefeller Foundation Virus Lab. in Poonah was the perceived threat of
YF. Indeed, at first sighting of Kyasanur Forest Disease (1957) the first
Director, the late Telford Work, thought he had hit the jackpot.
