African swine fever, Zimbabwe
-----------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 27 Jul 2015 from Dr Unesu Hildah Ushewokunze-Obatolu, Principal Director, Department of Livestock and Veterinary Services, Harare, Zimbabwe

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 10 Jul 2015
Date of confirmation of the event: 21 Jul 2015
Report date: 27 Jul 2015
Date submitted to OIE: 27 Jul 2015
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: March 1992
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: African swine fever [ASF] virus
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory (advanced), necropsy
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (2)
Outbreak 1 (ASF1/2015): Mukumbura, Mt Darwin, Mashonaland Central
Date of start of the outbreak: 10 Jul 2015
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: village
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed/ Slaughtered
Swine / 556 / 35 / 350 / 0 / 0
Affected population: swine of varying age groups kept under a free-range system.

Outbreak 2: Mukumbura, Mt Darwin, Mashonaland Central
Date of start of the outbreak: 10 Jul 2015
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: village
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed/ Slaughtered
Swine / 1362 / 15 / 15 / 0 / 0
Affected population: swine of varying age groups kept under a free-range system.

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 2
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed/ Slaughtered
Swine/ 1918 / 50/ 50 / 0 / 0

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Swine / 2.61 / 2.61 / 100 / 2.61
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with infected animal(s) at grazing/watering; contact with wild species.
Epidemiological comments: the disease was detected in domestic indigenous breed of pigs reared under a free range system in a communal set up. The disease was first detected in villages along the northern border with Mozambique. The country last reported cases of African swine fever (ASF) in this area more than 10 years ago. The whole of Mount Darwin district has been placed under quarantine with movement of swine and swine products not being allowed in or out of the district. Weekly inspections are currently on going in the affected villages and neighbouring properties within a 20 km [12.4 mi] radius. Infected carcasses are being disposed of through burning and burying.

Control measures
Measures applied: control of wildlife reservoirs; Quarantine; screening; disinfection/disinfestation; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; modified stamping out; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute (regional reference laboratory) / Swine / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 21 Jul 2015 / Positive
Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute-South Africa (regional reference laboratory) / Swine / virus isolation / -- / Pending

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[African swine fever (ASF) is a serious viral disease of pigs, endemic in Africa. The virus is currently the sole member of the new genus _Asfivirus_ in the family _Asfarviridae_. ASFV is the only DNA virus transmitted by arthropods.

As noted in the report above, the disease had been reported as absent since 1992; however, the disease is present in the countries which border Zimbabwe http://tinyurl.com/o9eo3da (Click on southern Africa, zoom in. Note: choose the disease and a list of countries by disease to reveal the situation.)

In endemic areas of Africa, the most important factor is to control the natural tick vectors and wild pig reservoirs, and/or limit their contact with domestic pigs.

During disease outbreaks, the rapid and efficient slaughtering of all pigs and the proper disposal of carcasses and all waste material is critical. Other important aspects to consider are the cleaning and disinfecting of affected farms, designation of the infected area and increased control of animal movements. Serological surveys should be undertaken in the surrounding area. In the presence of any suspicious haemorrhagic pig disease, a differential laboratory diagnosis should be undertaken, as low virulence ASF strains do not produce significant lesions (http://www.au-ibar.org/african-swine-fever).

ASF is not a zoonotic disease and does not affect public health.

[It is encouraging to see Zimbabwe eventually reporting ASF. The apparent absence of this infectious viral disaese in reports from Zimbabwe, a country which, as the map indicates, is half-surrounded by ASF-infected territories, has been rather puzzling. - Mod.AS]
