ADFCA launches campaigns to protect animal health
-------------------------------------------------
The Abu Dhabi Food Control Authority (ADFCA) announced on Saturday [17
Sep 2011] the launch of 2 campaigns to control the spread of 4
infectious diseases affecting animal health: Foot and mouth disease
[FMD], CCPP [contagious caprine
pleuropneumonia], PPR [peste des petits ruminants] and sheep and goat
pox. The 2 campaigns are related to spraying of insecticides and
immunisation of livestock.

The campaigns aim at eradicating epidemic diseases and external
parasites that cause and transmit them. The immunisation programme
will strengthen the immunity of livestock, thus increasing their
numbers and improving productivity.

The initiative will reduce the need for veterinary medicines and
treatments as well as guide livestock breeders about the nutritional
benefits of concentrated fodder.

The launch of these initiatives is part of a series of livestock
campaigns organised by the ADFCA targeting livestock breeders in the
Emirate of Abu Dhabi.

The campaigns will focus on the aspects of sustainable livestock
production in the emirate, such as increasing and improving the local
production of livestock and breeding.

[The 4 mentioned epizootic diseases are regarded endemic in UAE,
threatening the health of the local livestock population which
includes (2008 data) about 2.1 million goats, 375 000 sheep, 328 000
cattle, 28 000 camels. Mass vaccinations are fully justified as a
central component of the applied animal health protection programme.

The inclusion of desinsectisation (mass application of insecticides),
however, does not seem to be related to the said diseases, which are
not regarded vectorborne. The use of insecticides is to be sought in
relation to other diseases. One candidate is the cattle disease Lumpy
Skin Disease, which has been reported from UAE in 2000. Others are
tickborne diseases of cattle and small ruminants, such as
piroplasmosis, theileriosis and anaplasmosis, as well as viral
diseases such as RVF and Nairobi sheep disease which may be introduced
with imported animals. UAE is a major importer of live animals
(cattle, 5-digit, sheep, 6-digit numbers, annually), traded from
various sources, including Asian and African countries where the said
diseases are endemic.

A request for information on vaccinations routinely applied in goats
in UAE was included in archived post 20100329.0979. - Mod.AS]
