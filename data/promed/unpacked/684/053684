[H5N1 is a type of influenza virus that causes a highly infectious, severe respiratory disease in birds called avian influenza (or "bird flu"). Human cases of H5N1 avian influenza occur occasionally, but it is difficult to transmit the infection from person to person (http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/avian_influenza/h5n1.../faqs/en/).

As per the latest WHO update on human cases of A/H5N1 avian influenza, a total of 199 cases with 167 deaths have been reported from Indonesia to date [September 2017]. This case makes a total of 200/168. It must be noted that the last 2 cases of A/H5N1 from Indonesia were reported in 2015; http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/2017_07_25_tableH5N1.pdf?ua=1.

The success of avian influenza(AI) control is determined by the role and support of the whole community, especially the role of society in prevention efforts. The most important community messages are to avoid contact with birds that suddenly get sick or die; maintain personal hygiene and keep the environment clean and healthy; and to recognize the symptoms of bird flu that include fever, cough and sore throat and history of contact with sick poultry. If there are signs of AI immediately report to the clinic or hospital. - Mod.UBA

The source of infection of the victim (eg poultry farm, market, slaughterhouse, kitchen etc) has not been specified; available information will be appreciated. According to Indonesia's last available annual OIE report, covering 2016, the total annual number of HPAI outbreaks in poultry was 284, including HPAI H5N1 and other, unspecified, serotype(s). In Bali, the last (2) HPAI H5N1 outbreaks were recorded in Feb 2016, affecting 249 (dead) birds. The semi-annual report for January to June 2017 is not yet available. Indonesia's control measures on HPAI H5N1, during 2016, included modified stamping out and vaccination. - Mod.AS
