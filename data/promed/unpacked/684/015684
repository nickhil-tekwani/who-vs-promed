WEST NILE VIRUS UPDATE 2002 - USA (06)
**************************************
A ProMED-mail post

ProMED-mail is a program of the
International Society for Infectious Diseases

[Note: Now that West Nile virus infection is endemic throughout much of the
Eastern seaboard of the United States, most reports on West Nile virus
infection in year 2002 will be combined and presented as an "update" at
regular, but not more frequent than weekly, intervals determined by the
volume of such reports. As previously, however, reports of human infection,
infection of new hosts, extension of geographical range and events of
special significance will be posted immediately on receipt.
As of 31 May 2002, the USGS/CINDI West Nile virus National and State Maps
<http://cindi.usgs.gov/hazard/event/west_nile/west_nile.html> displayed the
following West Nile virus-positive test results:
Horses 10 (Florida 7, Louisiana 3)
Birds 33 (Washington, D.C. 1, Florida 4, Illinois 4, Louisiana 3, Michigan
1, Massachusetts 3, New Jersey 4, Pennsylvania 1, Virginia 3, New York 9).
In addition the suspected West Nile virus-positive bird found in Canada
(Ontario) has been confirmed positive. - Mod.CP]

Second West Nile Virus-positive Bird Found in Cook County
---------------------------------------------------------
A dead bird found in Wheeling has tested positive for the West Nile virus,
making it the second infected bird found in Cook County this year, village
health officials said. The crow was found 20 May 2002 in the 300 block of
East Dundee Road.
The first bird in the county to test positive for West Nile virus was found
on 15 May 2002 in La Grange.
Two dead birds found in early May in Hampshire in Kane County also have
tested positive. Infected birds and horses were first found in the state
last year [2001] as the virus spread west after an outbreak in and around
New York in 1999. West Nile encephalitis is an infection of the brain spread
by mosquitoes that feed on infected birds. No human cases have been reported
in Illinois.

Louisiana: Two Blue Jays [& 3 Horses] Test West Nile virus-positive
------------------------------------------------------
Two more birds, one found in Hammond and the other in Baton Rouge, contain
West Nile virus, health officials said on Mon 3 Jun 2002. "This confirms the
belief that West Nile virus is firmly established in Louisiana," said Bob
Johannessen of the State Health Department. Dead blue jays found on
Tanglewood Drive in Baton Rouge and Dame Alley in Hammond contained the
virus, Johannessen said. The bird found in Hammond was the first case of
West Nile virus found in Tangipahoa Parish, officials said. Previously, a
cardinal found in Baton Rouge tested positive for the virus.
Dr. Raoult Ratard, state epidemiologist, advised people to wear long sleeves
and pants when outdoors, and to use insect repellent on exposed skin. It's
not just a "seasonal problem in Louisiana," and residents need to "take
precautions year round," he said. People who find fresh dead birds can take
them to their parish health unit for examination, Johannessen said. Although
there's no danger of contracting the virus from handling intact dead birds,
people can place dead birds in plastic bags without touching them, he said.
"The bag should then be tied or sealed and placed inside another plastic
bag," he suggested.
The infected blue jay in Hammond was found on 19 May 2002. The one in Baton
Rouge was found on 17 May 2002. An LSU lab, which tests for mosquito-borne
diseases, found the virus in a cardinal from Baton Rouge in Feb 2002.
The lab also confirmed the virus in 3 horses; 2 from Cameron Parish and one
from Calcasieu Parish. No humans have been diagnosed with the virus in
Louisiana this year, officials with the Department of Health and Hospitals
said on Mon 3 Jun 2002.
