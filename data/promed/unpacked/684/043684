[1] The Netherlands: 1st 2008 outbreak confirmed (Overijssel)
Date: Thu 7 Aug 2008

The 1st case of the bluetongue livestock virus in the Netherlands in
2008 was confirmed on Thursday [7 Aug 2008], the Dutch Agriculture
Ministry said.

The case was discovered in a cow in the eastern town of Staphorst
[province of Overijssel], on a farm, which had not vaccinated its
animals against the disease, the ministry said in a statement.

Experts are investigating what strain of virus has affected the
animal and expect the results on Friday [8 Aug 2008], it said. "We
assume it is the same strain as last year's [2007], but we just want
to be sure," a ministry spokesman said. He said the ministry had
distributed 6 million doses of bluetongue vaccines this year [2008]
and had ordered in another million, which will be available next week.

The bluetongue virus swept through cattle herds and sheep flocks in
around 11 [European] countries in 2007 and has already occurred again
this year [2008] in a few countries.

The disease causes fever and mouth ulcers and in some cases turns an
animal's tongue blue. It is transmitted by insects and can be highly
dangerous to sheep and cows, although it does not affect humans. It
is most common in late summer and autumn, and is mainly found in
Mediterranean countries like Italy, Spain, and North Africa, but in
the past 2 years there were also cases in northern Europe.

[Staphorst (map at
<http://www.multimap.com/maps/?qs=staphorst&countryCode=NL>) is one
of the most religious towns of the Netherlands, said to grind to a
halt on Sundays. A large proportion of the population holds
fundamentalist Christian beliefs, and opposes technologies such as
television, blood transfusions, and even vaccinations. It will be
interesting to note if this applies in the current case, or that
non-vaccination of the cattle on the affected farm was just coincidental.

The number of BTV-8 outbreaks in the Netherlands increased 13-fold
from 2006 (456) to 2007 (6472). This may indicate that the unusual
high temperatures in the summer of 2006 were not the sole or main
reason for the epizootic. Hopefully, the fact that a large part of
the adult ruminant population has already undergone infection,
acquiring immunity, combined with the currently applied mass
vaccination, will lead to a considerably lower (clinical) disease
incidence during 2008. - Mod.AS]

Bluetongue -- extension of the BTV 1 and BTV 8 restriction zones
----------------------------------------------------------------
The restriction zones as related to bluetongue virus (BTV) serotypes
1 and 8 have been extended to cover the whole departments of the Ille
et Vilaine, Loire-Atlantique, the Pas-de-Calais, Lower Rhine, Vendee,
and the territory of Belfort.

The updated list of all the regulated communities/municipalities will
be sent by mail.

As of 6 Aug 2008, a total of 3198 BTV-8 cases are ascribed to viral
circulation during 2008.
17 new cases of BTV-1 are ascribed to virus circulation during 2008.

[The official update above includes a map showing the locations of
the new outbreaks and indicating their respective involved serotypes.
The document includes also a detailed list of the regions under BTV
restrictions.

Compared to data from the other BTV-8 infected European countries,
the figures above seem to be strikingly high. Can this be explained
by the geographic situation of France, at lower latitudes? Comments
from French laboratories involved in BTV diagnosis have been
requested and are anticipated with great interest. Clearly, the
behaviour of the vectors is a key issue in unfolding the dynamics of
BTV-8 in Europe, including the disease's overwintering mechanism and
seasonality.

The BTV-8 season has already started in Germany (where, as we have
unofficially noted, several additional outbreaks have been recorded
since 21 Jul 2008), Belgium, the Netherlands, and France. Allegedly,
the virus has been maintained in culicoid vectors, which have
overwintered, mainly indoors. Does/will this happen on the British
Isles as well?! Information from there will be welcomed, as well as
an update from Spain, where BTV-8 was initially recorded (in the
northern province of Cantabria) in January 2008. - Mod.AS]
