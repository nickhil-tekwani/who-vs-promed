Cholera: North West baffled
-------------------------
The North West provincial health department was still baffled on Fri, 2 Apr
2004, by the cause of the cholera outbreak in a township in Klerksdorp, a
spokesperson said. Barba Gaoganediwe said tests done on water collected
from the Kanana township were negative for cholera.
"We still don't know where the disease comes from," he said. "But we will
investigate every possible source."
He said underground water sources were also being tested for possible
contamination. Teams from the health department were distributing
educational material to residents of Kanana.
Meanwhile, 20 people were still under observation in hospital. 3 people
were still receiving treatment for cholera after it was confirmed that they
were suffering from the disease. They were in a satisfactory condition,
Gaoganediwe said. 2 other people have already been discharged from hospital.

5 more people admitted for cholera at Klerksdorp
---------------------------------------------------
The number of people admitted to the Klerksdorp hospital in the North West
and confirmed to have contracted cholera, has increased from 4 to 9. 2 are
in serious condition in the Intensive Care Unit. 8 other people suspected
of having contracted the disease are currently undergoing tests.
Kanana township, near Orkney, has a history of rampant outbreaks of
cholera. Past outbreaks of cholera in the area indicate that the victims
may have contracted the disease after using and drinking contaminated
water. The latest outbreak can be attributed to the outdated water supply
system, overcrowding, and the general unhygienic state of the township.
The provincial health department has embarked on immediate steps to correct
the situation. A departmental task team has been appointed to investigate
and identify the source of the outbreak and put measures in place to
contain further spread of the disease.
This is the 2nd outbreak of cholera to be reported in less than 2 years in
the area. In the last incident, 12 cases were reported in Orkney. Most were
caused by a leak from a sewerage pipe at Tau-Lekoa Mine.
[The original post stated that the last outbreak of cholera in this
province was in 2000. As stated in this posting, the outbreak was in 2002.

Cholera outbreak in South Africa kills 13
------------------------------------------
13 people have died in a cholera outbreak in rural South Africa in March,
while more than 100 others have been treated for the disease in recent weeks.
Sizwe Kupelo, a spokesman for the Eastern Cape province said Thu, 1 Apr
2004, that 13 people died in 3 villages between the towns of Kokstad and
Umtata in southeastern South Africa in Mar 2004.
Kupelo said the disease was probably spread through dirty water.
"In many of these areas there is no clean water or toilets -- people go to
the toilet in the bush, cholera spreads easily in these circumstances," he
said.
"The municipalities are trying to get permanent clean drinking water and
sanitation facilities into these areas, but they face a huge backlog,"
Kupelo added.
At least 7 million people out of a population of 44.8 million do not have
access to running water in South Africa, making them susceptible to the
water-borne disease.

Cholera too not far behind
----------------------------
There seems to be no respite from illness this season. The number of
cholera cases reported in the city has risen to 21 since Jan 2004 according
to Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) records. This year, the number of
cases in March 2004 was 15 as compared to 5 cases in March 2002. No cases
were reported in this month during 2003. The highest number of cases is in
the the central zone, which has reported 11 cases.
The incidence of cholera rises during the monsoon when dirty water collects
around shallow hand-pumps. The most susceptible areas are the central and
Civil Lines zones.

5 Die of Diarrhea in Maluku, Indonesia
--------------------------------------------
At least 5 people have died of diarrhea, and more than 40 have been treated
by central health office here following an outbreak of the disease in
Indonesia's Maluku province, a local health official told
ASEAN-Disease-Surveillance.net Thu 1 Apr 2004.
The official said the outbreak hit people in the village of Amarlaut, Gorom
Sub-district of Seram Bagian Timur Regency, Maluku beginning in early March
2004.
The village has about 1000 residents, and most of them have difficulties
finding clean water. This critical situation put them at risk for the disease.
Local health agencies have sent medicine and medical officers to support
treatment in the area.
