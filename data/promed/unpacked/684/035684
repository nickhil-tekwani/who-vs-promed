UNDIAGNOSED DIE-OFF, TOADS - GERMANY (04)
*******************************************
A ProMED-mail post

From: Joe Dudley <jdudley@eaicorp.com>

The previous commentary on disease impact and predator behavior do not
directly address the apparent major anomaly associated with this die-off,
the reported "exploding toad" syndrome.
Such a condition might be explained by exposure to chemical contaminants
that could disrupt the mucus membranes of the skin and/or osmotic exchange
balance of dermal or internal organ tissues, resulting in excess water
accumulation within body tissues, buildup of excess internal fluid
pressure, and subsequent explosive rupturing of body tissues.

[Dr. Dudley is correct, in that infectious diseases are only one
possibility. Toxins and chemicals are another. ProMED-mail has requested an
update on the testing and results. Presently, we have received nothing. If
there an authoritative response on testing, we would appreciate `if it
could be shared with us. - Mod.TG]
