E. COLI, AMERICAN MEAT INSTITUTE UPDATE

AMI represents the interests of packers and processors of beef, pork, lamb,
veal and turkey products and their suppliers throughout North America.
In recent years this pathogen has triggered foodborne illness outbreaks
carried by foods as diverse as unpasteurized apple juice, alfalfa sprouts,
ground beef and strawberries.
1. E. coli 0157:H7 Is Rare
"We have learned many things about this bacteria and how to prevent it,"
said American Meat Institute (AMI) President J. Patrick Boyle. "First, it
is quite rare -- only 0.2 percent of beef carcasses test positive for it,
according to USDA. And of more than 14,000 random ground beef samples
tested by USDA over the past three years, only seven have been positive for
E. coli 0157:H7 -- an incidence of less than one-tenth of one percent
[0.05% to be exact, with an incidence 1/5 of this in the finished patties.
Obviously mixing dilution is responsible for the reduction. -- RAL]," he
stated. But its rarity is both a blessing and a curse, Boyle said: a
blessing, because it is not as common as other foodborne pathogens; a
curse, because it is so rare that it is very difficult to find through
product testing.
New In-plant Technologies Destroy Pathogens
"Second, in recent years we have developed new techniques in our processing
plants to destroy pathogens," Boyle said. Blasting beef carcasses with
superheated steam, for example, reduces E. coli 0157:H7 Rinsing beef
carcasses with hot water and acidic solutions also reduces pathogens.
Irradiation has also been proven effective in destroying E. coli 0157:H7 in
ground beef patties.
2. New Pathogen Reduction/HACCP Rule Helps Prevent Contamination
A third way to help prevent pathogens from contaminating food is the use
of Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) systems. The Pathogen
Reduction/HACCP Rule also requires new microbiological monitoring of raw
meat and poultry. The new rule requires industry to test raw carcasses for
generic E. coli (beginning January 1997) and requires USDA to test raw
carcasses and ground meat and poultry for Salmonella (phased in, beginning
January 1998).
3. Micro Testing for E. coli 0157:H7 Useful But Limited
But Boyle noted that testing for a rare bacteria, such as E. coli 0157:H7,
has its limitations. "To find this elusive germ everytime it occurs in food
would require massive testing on a scale that is totally unfeasible," he
said. H
4. Missing Links in the War on E. coli 0157:H7
"Despite the mandatory safe food handling labels introduced in 1994 and
many well-intentioned consumer education efforts, most consumers still do
not know that ground beef must be cooked to 160 degrees to be absolutely
safe," Boyle said. "Consumers and other food preparers are the final link
in the food chain.
Boyle said that industry groups, government agencies and consumer
organizations formed the Partnership for Food Safety Education last year to
address this consumer knowledge gap, and that the Partnership would soon
launch a new, high-impact public health education campaign on safe food
handling.
The final missing link, according to Boyle, is prevention methods for E.
coli 0157:H7 in livestock on the farm.
5. Useful Statistics
Number of beef carcasses produced annually in the U.S.: 37 million
Average carcass weight: 702 lbs.
Pounds of beef produced annually in the U.S.: 25 billion
Pounds of ground beef produced annually in the U.S.: 7 billion
Annual sales of ground beef: $9 billion
Annual per person consumption of ground beef: 27 lbs.
Incidence of E. coli 0157:H7 on beef carcasses: 0.2%
Average length of time raw ground beef is kept in plants: 48 hours
Average length of time raw ground beef is kept in supermarkets: 48 hours
