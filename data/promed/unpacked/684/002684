Some 38 wild birds have tested positive for a lethal strain of bird
flu in a 4th German state, health authorities said Thursday [5 Jul
2007]. The birds were found with the H5N1 strain in the eastern state
of Thuringia, the Friedrich Loeffler federal animal diseases
institute said. They were among 100 birds found dead in an artificial
lake on the border between Thuringia and the state of Saxony-Anhalt.
Tests were being carried out on the other birds by the disease
laboratory on the Baltic Sea island of Riems.

Last week [25 Jun-1 Jul 2007], wild swans, geese and ducks were found
with H5N1 in Leipzig in the eastern state of Saxony and in the
southern city of Nuremberg in Bavaria.

French authorities said Thursday [5 Jul 2007], that 3 swans found
dead in eastern France were carrying the deadly H5N1 virus.

Last year [2006], bird flu was confirmed in 13 European Union member
states: Germany, Austria, Denmark, Italy, Greece, Britain, the Czech
Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, France, and Hungary.

A new outbreak was confirmed in the Czech Republic late last month
[June 2007]. German officials said they believed the disease might
have spread from there to Germany.

Germany was expected to raise its risk-preventive measures throughout
the country from "moderate" to "high," following the latest deaths.

Avian Influenza has been confirmed in wild birds in another region in
Germany and suspected in France and Austria.

The French and Austrian authorities have confirmed that there are new
suspected cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza [HPAI] in wild
birds in their territories. [The French cases -- 3 swans -- have
been confirmed in the meantime. - Mod.AS]. Germany has also confirmed
the occurrence of disease in Thuringia.

All 3 Member States are applying the precautionary measures set out
under EU legislation. National laboratories are also working
intensively to determine whether the outbreaks were caused by the
H5N1 virus. In Germany, the national reference laboratory has now
confirmed the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in a
black-necked grebe [_Podiceps nigricollis_] in Thuringia, close to
the border with Saxony

A suspicion of highly pathogenic avian influenza has also been
reported in the district of Gmunden, Upper Austria, based on clinical
signs of the disease in a number of wild birds. The Austrian national
authorities have sent samples from these birds to the national
reference laboratory and expect results on the strain of the virus in
the coming days.

Tests have confirmed that 3 swans found dead in eastern France were
killed by the H5N1 bird flu virus, the French agriculture ministry
said on Thursday [5 Jul 2007], France's 1st cases of the disease in
over a year.

"Michel Barnier, minister of agriculture and fishing, is putting in
place the risk-prevention measures corresponding to the shift from
the 'moderate' level to the 'high' level," the ministry said in a
statement.

The 'high' level means that birds and poultry in mainland France will
either have to be locked up or protected by nets to avoid all contact
with wild birds, a ministry official said. Pigeon races and other
events where birds are gathered will be forbidden.

Germany said it was raising its assessment of the risk of bird flu
following the French announcement and after officials on Wednesday [4
Jul 2007] discovered more birds that had died of the H5N1 virus, this
time in the eastern state of Thuringia.

On Thursday [5 Jul 2007], Spain's Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries,
and Food asked veterinary services to be more vigilant in the outlook
for possible bird flu cases. Spain already bans hunting with decoys,
outdoor poultry raising, and the isolation of breeding areas for wild
aquatic birds in high-risk zones like bird migratory paths and
wetlands.

In 98 "humid zones" in France, or around 15 percent of the country,
there will be special veterinary checks at poultry farms.

French Health Minister, Roselyne Bachelot, said on French television
that the country was not threatened by a flu pandemic at this stage
but that the government would remain on alert. "We have to be
extremely vigilant because the large flu epidemic that appeared after
World War I, also known as Spanish flu, was of avian origin," she
said.

In Britain, the government said there were no new measures in place
yet although the situation in France was being monitored in close
liaison with the European Commission. "A preliminary outbreak
assessment is under way and we are monitoring the risks. We would
urge all bird keepers to maintain high levels of biosecurity and
vigilance," a spokeswoman said.

France, Europe's biggest poultry producer, increased its precautions
against bird flu in June [2007], saying the risk of the disease
hitting the country had gone up after it was found in a number of
wild birds in Germany and in the Czech Republic.

A French poultry breeders' group said in a statement that sanitary
practices they put in place gave them sufficient tools to thwart the
spread of the disease.

Last year [2006], 13 European Union member states had confirmed cases
of bird flu -- Germany, Austria, Denmark, Italy, Greece, Britain, the
Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, France, and
Hungary.

In France [in 2006], the virus was found in more than 60 wild birds
and at a farm with 11 000 turkeys. It had not been detected in the
country since April 2006.

More than 30 countries have reported outbreaks in the past year
[2006-2007], in most cases involving wild birds such as swans.

Globally, the H5N1 virus has killed nearly 200 people out of over 300
known cases, according to the World Health Organisation. None of the
victims were from Europe.

France found 3 wild swans that died this week had avian flu,
suggesting the lethal H5N1 virus is spreading again across Europe.

At least 5 other European nations have reported avian influenza
outbreaks this year [2007], according to the Paris-based World
Organization for Animal Health [OIE]. A strain that killed 12 wild
birds in Germany in the past month, is almost identical to that found
earlier this year [2007] in the Czech Republic, Germany's Friedrich
Loeffler center for animal health said.

This year's [2007] outbreaks probably spread through the migration of
infected water birds. They leave traces of the virus on the surface
water when they touch down on lakes, in turn infecting less transient
local birds. Dead swans are often the 1st sign of an outbreak, said
Albert Osterhaus, director of New-Flu Bird, a European project based
in the Netherlands bringing together ornithologists and virologists.

"They are the sentinels of the disease" and may indicate that more
avian infections will follow, Osterhaus said in a telephone interview.

The H5N1 virus reached the European Union for the 1st time last year
[2006], starting in Greece and Italy and reaching birds in France,
Germany, and a dozen other nations on the continent.

France's agriculture ministry today confirmed that 3 swans found dead
on a lake in the Moselle region, which borders Germany, died of bird
flu.

Germany's Friedrich Loeffler center is testing the carcass of another
bird found in the province of Thuringia as well as soil samples that
could tie the deaths to the strain of H5N1 virus found in other
countries. In Thuringia, authorities have sealed off a 3-km (2-mi)
area around the find. A further 10 km (6 mi) function as an
observation perimeter. Thuringian authorities have ordered all
poultry within the area to be kept in their pens as a precaution.

Poultry in France's Moselle region also has been confined and local
wildlife is under observation. "The measures show an increase in
awareness," says Alex Thiermann, president of the Code Commission [of
the OIE], a Paris-based standards setting body for animal health. The
effect on poultry farming will probably be limited, Thiermann said.
Confinement will not stop bird flu spreading among wild birds, though
it does make it tough for the virus to leap from wild to domestic
birds, and any cases of infected poultry will be limited to
individual farms, Thiermann said. The danger to the human and
commercial bird population will be limited if vigilant measures
continue to be enforced.

Since 3 Jul 2007, 8 dead birds have been found on a promenade in the
Austrian town of Altmuenster, which is situated on a lake, ORF state
television reported on its website. The state veterinarian began
testing them immediately for bird flu, and the results won't be known
for 2 or 3 days, ORF said.

Migratory patterns are hard to predict this year [2007]. Birds
typically fly from cold spots to hotter ones. This summer, heat waves
in parts of Europe make it more difficult to determine avian routes.

"Birds aren't like British Airways; they don't always fly between
Moscow and London," said John Oxford, professor of virology at St
Bartholomew's hospital in London. "They know roughly where they are
going, but they don't always end up there."
