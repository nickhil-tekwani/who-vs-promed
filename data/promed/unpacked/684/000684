Northeast France: Increased Number of Cases of Hantavirus
Infection in 2003
------------------------
In total 104 cases of hantavirus infection [i.e. resulting in
hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome or HFRS, the type of illness
associated with hantavirus infection in Northern Europe] have been
reported by the Centre National de Reference (CNR) des Fievres
Hemorragiques Virales (the National Reference Centre for Viral
Hemorrhagic Fevers) during the period from the end of December
2002 to the end of August 2003.
This number is higher than the number of cases observed for the
preceding 3 years; during the whole of 2002 only 61 cases of
infection were observed. [The outcome of an investigation of this
outbreak by the InVS and CIRE is summarized below. - Mod.CP]

[A graphical illustration at the InVS web-site
<http://www.invs.sante.fr/recherche/index.htm> shows the number
of HFRS cases by month for the period September 2002 to August
2033 inclusive and clearly indicates the increased number of
cases observed since the beginning of 2003. 54 of the 104 cases
have been investigated in detail. 44 (82 percent) were men. Ages
ranged from 8 to 64 (median 38). More than 50 percent of the
cases are resident in the Ardennes and Aisne. All the cases were
presumed to have been infected close to their homes. The dates of
onset of signs of illness were known for 43 of the 54 cases
investigated. Most (29 percent) exhibited initial signs of infection
during January and February [2003], and to a lesser extent in early
spring 2003. A total of 46 of the 54 examined (85 percent)
required hospital care. The most frequent signs were fever,
thrombocytopenia, hypercreatininemia, etc. (tabulated in
detail at the web-site). One case presented with hemorrhagic
symptoms, and another with cardiac arrythmia. None of the
patients required dialysis. The majority of the patients reported
exposure to risk factors during the 2 weeks preceding the onset of
illness. 63 percent of the patients lived in forested areas, 9 (17
percent) were hunters, and 3 (6 percent) had contact with rodent
carcasses; and almost all the others had some professional,
recreational, or other involvement with forest products or woodland
areas.
The investigation of these cases concluded that there had been an
excess of HFRS cases in January/February 2003 compared with
the preceding year. All the affected individuals were resident in a
known endemic area. The risk factors were those known to be
associated with hantavirus infection. Increased vigilance during
winter and early spring is recommended for residents of endemic
regions of northeast France.
