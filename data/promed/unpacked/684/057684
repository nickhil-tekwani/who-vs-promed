[Cases of yellow fever (YF) have continued to occur in humans and non-human primates in several localities in Brazil. The full report, accessible at the above URL, provides more details with maps and graphs. As has been noted frequently in previous ProMED-mail posts, yellow fever virus is endemic in Brazil and several other South American countries that have tropical forests where the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle is maintained. So far, in Brazil, the sylvan cycle has not spilled over to urban and suburban areas where _Aedes aegypti_ populations are abundant.

Currently, vaccination is the best preventive measure available. The risk of adverse effects due to the vaccine is small, approximately one in 1 million. Yellow fever is a serious disease with a case fatality rate of approximately 30% and a potential for rapid spread in an urban situation with a population with low vaccination coverage and abundant mosquito vectors. - Mod.TY
