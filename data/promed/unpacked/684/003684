From: Prof. Slenczka <slenczka@mailer.uni-marburg.de>

I have read a lot of reports on the occurrence of prion related disease in
elk in the USA, but I have never heard a good explanation, why this disease
is found in the American elk. Does this disease also occur in wild living
elks or is it found only in elk farms? If so, the next question would be:
were these elks in the elk farms fed with British meat-powder? Is there any
evidence such powder was also exported to the US? Was it used only for elk
or also for other animals? I am sure there is more information available on
this theme than is generally known, and I would appreciate hearing more
about it.

[Werner asks some good questions. I do not have a good answer for why
Chronic Wasting Disease is found in American Elk. The disease does occur in
wild elk. It is also found in farmed elk. Were the farmed elk once wild
elk? I suppose it is possible. I do not know. I believe Werner is inquiring
about Meat and Bone Meal (MBM) when he asks about powder being fed to the
animals. Was MBM from the UK imported to the US and used in farmed elk
feed? Werner's next question regarding MBM being fed to other animals is a
good question. I do not have an answer to either of these questions. If
there is someone who has a reliable answer, I would appreciate you sharing
your information. - Mod.TG
