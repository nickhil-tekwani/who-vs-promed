[ProMED-mail thanks Prof. Be-Nazir Ahmed for his very prompt and helpful response to our request for information.

It seems curious that the original report of the encephalitis cases did not mention Nipah virus as the possible etiological agent, since this is the Nipah season in Bangladesh, and health care providers there are familiar with the disease. Also, there was no mention about the consumption of date palm sap, the usual source of the infection. - Mod.TY
