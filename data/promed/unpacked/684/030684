The Loudoun County Department of Animal Services is alerting residents a cat has tested positive for rabies in the Lovettsville area.

The cat was found in the area of 11400 Berlin Turnpike, the department says, and the cat was injured and taken to a veterinary hospital by a Good Samaritan.

Any outside pets in the area, especially cats and dogs, should be checked to make sure they are current on their rabies vaccinations, the department adds.

The department is asking for anyone who may have come into contact with an unknown domestic short hair, brown tabby type cat in the area to contact them.

Further concerns or questions can also be addressed to the department by phone or email.

Gwinnett Animal Welfare and Enforcement captured the fox the same day. But the department, along with the county health department, are advising residents to use caution and avoid animals behaving in unusual ways.

The children were attacked by the fox in the Dolostone Way/Austin Crossing area in Dacula. The animal tested positive for rabies on Thursday (21 May 2020). The disease can spread to people and pets through bites and scratches.

The county urged pet owners to ensure their animals are current on their rabies vaccinations. According to the National Association of State Health Veterinarians, unvaccinated dogs and cats exposed to a rabid animal must be strictly quarantined for 4 months and vaccinated 1 month prior to being released, the county said.

Untreated, rabies in humans is almost always fatal. Early symptoms of rabies in people include fever, headache, and general weakness or discomfort. Anyone who thinks they have been exposed to rabies should immediately seek medical care, then contact the Gwinnett County Health Department at 770-339-4260 and ask for the epidemiologist on call.

To report the animal and have it picked up, call the Gwinnett County Animal Welfare and Enforcement Bite Office.

The Gwinnett County Animal Welfare and Enforcement Division and the Gwinnett County Health Department are advising residents to use caution and avoid animals behaving in unusual ways after a fox tested positive for the rabies virus.

According to officials, 2 children were attacked by the fox in the Dolostone Way/Austin Crossing area in Dacula last week (19 May 2020). The fox was contained by Gwinnett Animal Welfare and Enforcement on the same day (19 May 2020). The fox was tested for rabies and the results came back positive. [This is written in such a way it as to imply it was the same fox, but I am uncertain how they know this unless the animal was under constant surveillance until it was dispatched. - Mod.TG]

The children were immediately taken to the hospital following the attack and are healthy, Alan Davis, the Division Director of Animal Welfare and Enforcement.

According to Davis, the fox was reported as acting lethargic and in a state of 'drunkenness' by several residents who saw the animal following the attack. Davis added they have not received any additional reports in the area of other animals appearing to have rabies, but they are asking residents to be cautious.

"We really want to make sure pet owners are talking to their animal's vets and making sure the pets are up to date on the rabies vaccinations," said Davis.

According to the National Association of State Health Veterinarians, unvaccinated dogs and cats exposed to a rabid animal must be strictly quarantined for 4 months and vaccinated 1 month prior to being released.

As stated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the rabies virus attacks the central nervous system and is almost always fatal in humans if untreated. Early symptoms of rabies in people include fever, headache, and general weakness or discomfort. If you or someone you know has been bitten or scratched by any stray animals or an animal suspected to have rabies, preventive treatment for rabies is necessary.

If you believe you have been exposed, you're asked to contact the Gwinnett County Health Department and ask for the epidemiologist on call. To report the animal and have it picked up, call the Gwinnett County Animal Welfare and Enforcement Bite Office; after hours, or contact Dispatch non-emergency number.

The animal shelter is also offering the following tips to residents concerning protection from rabies:
- make sure your pets get their rabies shots regularly [check with your veterinarian regarding how often they are needed. - Mod.TG];
- keep your pets on your property;
- do not leave garbage or pet food outside. Food left out may attract wild or stray animals;
- rabid animals may act tame. They may also display strange or unusual behavior. They may act aggressively, avoid food and water, foam at the mouth, have trouble moving or move in a stiff, odd way. Stay away from any unknown animals, especially wildlife. Report any animal acting unusually to Gwinnett County Animal Welfare and Enforcement;
- stay away from wild, sick, hurt, or dead animals. Do not pick up or move sick or hurt animals;
- do not keep wild animals like raccoons, skunks, foxes, and coyotes as pets. It is dangerous and also illegal;
- teach your children not to go near, tease, or play with wild animals or strange dogs and cats.

[Articles [2] and [3] are related. They are submitted together because of some extra data. However, realize the incident happened on 19 May 2020 and there were results of the fox testing positive on 21 May 2020. The article [3] may be reported later as it appears to be from a news reporting agency in a slightly different area.

It is critical to vaccinate your animals against rabies. This is a protection for your pets as well as for yourselves. Rabies is a fatal disease in all animals and in almost all human beings. There are only a handful of reported cases surviving a rabid animal bite without receiving post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in the specified time frame. Those individuals, while surviving, are not in the same pre-bite condition, and often have permanent disabilities.

Article [1] clearly demonstrates cats and dogs can be affected by rabies. This article tells us the cat was a feral cat. Some counties sponsor a trap/vaccinate/release program especially for feral cats but occasionally dogs are included. Some counties extend this program to include sterilization of the feral cats at the same time to reduce the over population of feral cats in an area.

Please be cautious of stray animals, especially if their actions are a little abnormal. - Mod.TG
