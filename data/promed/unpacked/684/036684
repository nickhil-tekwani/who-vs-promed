Scientists at Sugar Research Australia (SRA) have named the organism responsible for chlorotic streak disease (CSD) in sugarcane, as part of a breakthrough that had been a scientific mystery for almost 90 years. The researchers identified the single-celled organism as a type of Cercozoa. The Cerozoon responsible for CSD is new to science and was given the name _Phytocercomonas venanatans_. The name means "swims in the veins" and refers to its method of movement and its specific home in sugarcane xylem vessels. It is about 10 micrometres in length, about 0.01 millimetres. The search for the culprit behind CSD dates back to 1929 when the disease was 1st identified, almost simultaneously in Australia, Indonesia, and Hawaii.

"Now that techniques are available to visualise, isolate and quantify the CSD organism experimentally, we can begin to address questions such as how the organism infects naturally through the roots, how it lives within the plant and causes disease, how cells are released back into the soil, and how the organism survives for extended periods outside the plant," SRA's Dr Chuong Ngo said.

Dr Kathy Braithwaite, SRA, is developing a variety resistance screening method for CSD to incorporate into the SRA plant breeding program and provide data on CSD susceptibility [for] new varieties. The project is also working on a diagnostic test. The CSD test already exists as a research tool and is hoped to be used to assist in delivering clean plant source material. Previous research in Australia has shown yield losses from CSD as high as 40 per cent of sugar yield in susceptible varieties, with an estimated cost of AUD 8-10 million annually, making it one of the most costly diseases facing the industry.

[Chlorotic streak disease (CSD) of sugar cane is widespread in many areas worldwide and was 1st recognised in 1929. Symptoms include white to yellow, often fragmented leaf streaks with uneven margins, followed by leaf necrosis, reddish necrosis of vascular tissue in stalk nodes and stunting of plants. Germination of seedcanes may be reduced. Yield losses of up to 25 per cent have been reported, depending on the cane cultivar. Symptoms may be transient since expression is dependent on environmental factors such as temperature and high soil moisture, and this may make diagnosis difficult.

CSD is favoured by high rainfall and/or poor drainage and incidence is affected by weather conditions during the previous year. Transmission occurs via planting material, contaminated soil and water. The disease agent does not appear to survive in subterranean aquifers such as bores. Some disease control is achieved by placing seedcane sources in water heated to 50 deg C for up to 3 hours, but rapid reinfection of seedcanes in the field may occur. Meristem tissue culture was successfully used to eliminate CSD from seedcane lines. In Australia, up to 50 000 ha may be affected annually and highly productive varieties used widely are highly susceptible and may collapse under heavy disease pressure.

_Phytocercomonas venanatans_ (Pv), reported above as a new member of phylum Cercozoa, is a novel pathogen. Cercozoa are a highly diverse group of microscopic eucaryots, closely related based on molecular data but highly divergent in morphology and ecology. They include species from soils, fresh and marine waters, or the phyllosphere of plants. Many of their families are still poorly described and the vast majority of species are still unknown. Much research is still needed on this phylum and, therefore, the identification of this new species from sugar cane is an important contribution.

Another plant disease caused by a member of the Cercozoa (although from a different taxonomic order within it) is clubroot of _Brassicaceae_. It is a destructive soil-borne disease caused by _Plasmodiophora brassicae_ and affects nearly all cultivated members of brassicas, including oilseed rape and cabbages (for more information see ProMED-mail post 20180503.5780419).

In Australia, the cause of another sugar cane disease of unknown aetiology, Yellow canopy syndrome (YCS), is still being investigated. YCS has only been reported from Queensland and does not resemble any known diseases of the crop observed anywhere else in the world (see, for example, ProMED-mail post 20160316.4093427).
