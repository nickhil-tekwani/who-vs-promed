[1] Missed 2nd vaccinations

More than 1 in 10 people in the US have missed their 2nd dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, new data from the CDC showed. As the country begins to see a rise in coronavirus cases caused by the highly transmissible Delta variant, public health experts are urging Americans to complete the vaccination process.

Around 88% of people who were eligible for a 2nd dose received it as of 16 Jun [2021], according to CDC data shared with CNN, a decrease from the 92% completion rate seen earlier this year [2021].

This adds up to nearly 15 million people who have not received their 2nd shot, which, for the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines is recommended 21 and 28 days, respectively, after the 1st dose. On top of that, 1.5% of people eligible for their 2nd dose -- or 2 million people -- had not yet completed their vaccination series but were still within an "allowable interval" of 42 days between shots.

Early studies have found that the Delta variant does somewhat reduce the efficacy of vaccines, with one British study finding an overall 10% absolute reduction in vaccine effectiveness after both doses. Still, other studies have shown that getting the 2nd dose can more than double the vaccine's efficacy; for example, a study by Public Health England found that the efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine jumped from 33% with the 1st dose to 88% with the 2nd dose.

"It's clear how important the 2nd dose is to secure the strongest possible protection against COVID-19 and its variants, and I urge everyone to book in their jab when offered," said Matt Hancock, former UK health and social care secretary.

Adults under the age of 30 were the most likely to miss their 2nd dose, according to CNN's report; adults ages 30-39 were the next age group found to be more likely than average to miss their 2nd shot. This fact didn't come as a surprise to Leana Wen, MD, MSc, professor of health policy at George Washington University's Milken School of Public Health.

"This is an age group of many people who are working, who probably have many responsibilities when it comes to childcare and other factors in their lives," Wen told MedPage Today. "Getting a 2nd dose of the vaccine may not be top of mind."

Like many other vaccines that require more than one dose, Wen said, there's always a drop-off to be expected between shots, especially as COVID-19 stops being at the forefront of everyone's daily lives. But, in Wen's view, doctors might be able to play a crucial role in getting their patients fully vaccinated.

"If there's a patient who [doctors] are concerned will not return for that 2nd dose, offer the Johnson & Johnson vaccine," Wen said. "One dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is effective against COVID-19, including the Delta variant. One dose of the mRNA vaccine is not."

According to the latest tally from the CDC, 55% of the US population has received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, and 48% have been fully vaccinated. Among adults in the US, 67% of those over the age of 18 have received at least one dose, and 59% have been fully vaccinated.

[2] Future scenario of COVID

Citation. Kofman A, Kantor R, Adashi EY: Potential COVID-19 Endgame Scenarios: Eradication, Elimination, Cohabitation, or Conflagration? JAMA. Published online 8 Jul 2021; doi: 10.1001/jama.2021.11042.

High vaccination rates of the adult US population have given rise to the hope that a return to prepandemic life may be in the offing. However, differential vaccine access, persistent vaccine hesitancy, emerging viral variants, and deadly global disease waves may well stand in the way. In that volatility has heretofore been the invariant attribute of SARS-CoV-2, envisioning a future steady state can be inherently problematic. This Viewpoint describes 4 potential scenarios -- eradication, elimination, cohabitation, and conflagration -- comprising a spectrum of "end games" that may constitute the resolution of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, other scenarios also may be possible.

What would it take to eradicate SARS-CoV-2? By definition, eradication would require the permanent global reduction of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2-mediated disease to zero. To realize such an outcome, sufficient herd immunity would have to be achieved through vaccination and prior infection. Both vaccine- and infection-derived immunity would have to be highly effective, long-lasting, adept at preventing secondary transmission and reinfection, and protective against all manner of present and future viral variants.

Given these relatively astringent requirements, eradication may prove to be too aspirational a goal even as a thought experiment, let alone as a public health strategy. However, smallpox, yet another highly contagious respiratory infection, was irreversibly eradicated, an outcome once considered unimaginable. Other vaccine-preventable airborne diseases such as measles and rubella have been the subject of elimination, that is, the regional, rather than global, reduction of disease prevalence to zero. Elimination may well constitute a more realistic near-term goal for SARS-CoV-2, especially if slow-to-distribute booster vaccines become necessary to target emerging viral variants. Evidence of the successful elimination of SARS-CoV-2 is rapidly accumulating. Elimination may be close at hand in Israel, a model of vaccination efficiency wherein incident SARS-CoV-2 cases are presently at 0.7% of their all-time high (1). Similar successes could be realized in other nations wherein sufficiently high vaccination rates have been achieved. Temporary elimination of SARS-CoV-2 absent the advent of vaccines may well prove feasible as well as demonstrated by New Zealand in early August of 2020.

Were eradication or elimination to be achieved in the US or elsewhere, ongoing vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants would be required to counter the ongoing risk of suspected zoonotic transfer from bats, farmed minks, or yet-to-be uncovered animal reservoirs (2). In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 stands out relative to smallpox, for which no known animal reservoir has been identified. It follows that absent indefinite future vaccination efforts against SARS-CoV-2, durable elimination, let alone eradication, may prove infeasible.

Alternatively, might a more civil cohabitation be achieved with SARS-CoV-2, an outcome short of all-out eradication or substantial elimination? In this scenario, vaccine-mediated protection would go so far as to prevent the most severe manifestations of COVID-19, interrupt the chain of viral transmission, and counter the majority of emergent viral variants. Evidence in support of the realization of such scenario is likely to include, but not be limited to, the documentation of sparse reinfections, rare vaccine breakthroughs, and negligible secondary transmission even in the face of most viral variants (3-5).

In a world with a state of immunologic cohabitation, distinct viral-free pockets of infection may well exist wherein vaccine uptake is high. Whereas most incident infections would slow down significantly, some may well persist at either low levels or in the form of sporadic outbreaks outside of the viral-free pockets in question. Such new infections would be expected to occur predominantly among the undervaccinated. Rare breakthrough infections among vaccinated people may come to pass due to limited vaccine efficacy, immunocompromised states, sporadic vaccine supply or quality control issues, or future viral variants. Overall, however, despite occasional new infections, a more tolerable endemicity may well replace the volatility of the pandemic phase.

As vaccine accessibility expands globally, as vaccine hesitancy and access challenges subside, and as viral replication and variant generation are reduced, the number of viral-free pockets may well grow. Although vaccination may well continue to provide high levels of immunity against viral variants, boosters may be required to maintain the status quo. Where and when vaccination rates sputter and infections reoccur, new localized outbreaks may be seeded.

In these instances, the implementation of and adherence to preventive public health measures may still be required. However, for those who are either vaccinated or who reside in geographic areas with low case prevalence, with limited selection of viral variants, or both, the risk of infection is likely to be manageably low. Over the long term, however, as global immunity due to exposure or vaccination becomes commonplace, the disease symptoms experienced may come to resemble those of the common cold, which is brought about by seasonal coronaviruses.

Absent a cohabitation option, the end game may well come to resemble a conflagration, that is, a steady state characterized by moderate-level endemicity of SARS-CoV-2. With large segments of the population undervaccinated due to access constraints, hesitancy, or immunocompromised states, the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 is bound to remain robust. This would afford the virus with continuous opportunities to replicate and adapt so as to evade host-mediated and vaccine-derived immune responses. Among vaccinated populations, infections could still arise periodically due to incomplete vaccine-derived immunity, the waning of vaccine efficacy, evasion by new viral variants, or transmission from the unvaccinated. Two recent breakthrough cases of variant SARS-CoV-2 serve as an important reminder of such a possibility (6).

The degree of conflagration may come to depend substantially on the efficacy and acceptance of vaccines by geography. Potential coverage gaps against specific variants have been noted for several vaccines. The utility of the AstraZeneca vaccine against the B.1.351 variant is one such example (7). Similar gaps in the coverage of worrisome variants may exist for other vaccines for which publicly available data have heretofore been either absent, sparse, or limited to in vitro studies. Assuming a state of conflagration, with much of the world subject to limited availability of vaccines or to less-effective ones, ongoing outbreaks on a wider scale are to be expected.

Only a year ago, much of the world was united in lockdown in the midst of the 1st outbreak of COVID-19. Today, the global experience is widely divergent. Israel, New Zealand, Viet Nam, and Brunei may well be approaching elimination. The United Kingdom, the United States, and China, for their part, appear to exist in a state of cohabitation. In contrast, India, other parts of Southeast Asia, and much of South America appear to be weighed down by a conflagration-like state. Reversing the fortunes of nations in the grip of a conflagration-like state will require the buildup of population-level immunity via vaccines capable of neutralizing new viral variants.

Breakthroughs in the development of highly effective therapeutics, should they occur, stand to further disrupt the global status quo with an eye toward accelerating recovery, especially in the conflagration context. Ultimately, where on the endgame spectrum individual countries end up will depend on both the collective choices and realities of the global community and the oft-inscrutable and perhaps unpredictable dynamics of SARS-CoV-2.

[In the past 24 hours, 11 countries including Brazil (48 504), India (41 475), Indonesia (35 094), UK (31 800), Russia (25 082), South Africa (21 610), Colombia (20 915), the USA (14 695), Iran (11 664), Argentina (11 561), and the Netherlands (10 283), have reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 7457 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 8 Jul 2021 to late 9 Jul 2021). A total of 53 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 23 of the 53 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 7 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the South East Asia region, 5 are from the Western Pacific region, and 5 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 10.8%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 0.09%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 29.6% increase in daily reported cases and 19.2% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 400 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 187.26 million cumulative reported cases and over 4.04 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
