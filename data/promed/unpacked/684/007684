[Re: Yellow fever - Brazil (Sao Paulo): suspected, posted 16 Apr 2003
-- see ref. at end]
The report must not be taken seriously. The case was of a previously
vaccinated young photographer who had not recently been away from the
urban area. A careful clinical investigation was sufficient to assure
that it was not yellow fever. The patient is currently very well.
The case was reported on 27 Mar 2003. A reporter misinterpreted a
[booster] yellow fever vaccination, conducted to coincide with
influenza vaccination for adults of or older than 60 years, that
began last Saturday, 12 Apr 2003.
Yellow fever vaccination campaigns are being conducted in the area
due to an as-yet-undiagnosed monkey die-off in the Rio Grande basin
area (the Rio Grande divides Sao Paulo state from Minas Gerais
state). In this area, 3 human yellow fever cases occurred in 2000.
Urban yellow fever has not been reported in the state of Sao Paulo
since the 1930s, and sylvatic yellow fever had its last outbreak in
Sao Paulo in 1951-53. Since then, only the cases in 2000 (2 in Sao
Paulo and one in Minas Gerais) have been reported. In the Rio Grande
and Parana basins, yellow fever vaccination is routine at 9 months
(now moving to 12 months) of age, and regular campaigns are conducted
for the adult population. After the monkey die-off (no evidence of
yellow fever has been found, although 2 necropsies have been
performed) house-to-house vaccination of the rural population was
implemented in the area and urban campaigns are being conducted.
Please note that ProMED-PORT did not carry the message.

[I should have checked with Luiz before posting -- he is in charge of
all disease reporting for Sao Paulo state. There are many reasons
why a definitive diagnosis cannot be made of the cause of a monkey
death, including deterioration of the carcass, so it is a sensible
precaution to vaccinate the population when monkeys are found dead in
the area. - Mod.JW]
