The 1st mosquitoes in this area to test positive for the eastern
equine encephalitis (EEE) virus this summer [2007] were found this
week in the Toad Harbor area of West Monroe.
The virus was found only in the type of mosquitoes that bite birds,
not in the type that feed on humans or other mammals, according to
Kathleen Smith, Oswego County's Public Health Director. The
mosquitoes were collected 25 Jun [2007], near a large swamp along the
north shore of Oneida Lake, Smith said.
Surveillance of mosquitoes, which is conducted by the county Health
Department and the state Department of Health (NY DOH), has been
minimal so far this year [2007] because the weather has been so dry.
Because of the dry weather, and the lack of finding any bird-biting
mosquitoes with the virus, aerial spraying is not warranted, she said.

[Dr Kramer indicated that John Howard, NY State Department of Health,
reported to her that the EEE virus was isolated from a pool of
_Culiseta melanura_ mosquitoes. She indicated that although isolation
of this virus from _C. melanura_ from a swamp in central New York is
not unusual, finding the virus this early in the season is unusual.
One wonders if this a harbinger of early transmission by bridge
vectors (mosquitoes that feed on mammals, carrying the virus out from
enzootic swamp foci), with subsequent equine and human cases. Horse
owners would be well advised to be sure that their animals are
vaccinated.
