The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) has alerted the Nigerian
government of the presence of 9 cases of wild polio virus in the
northwestern state of Zamfara.
Speaking at a signing ceremony of a program implementation agreement
with the Nigerian government, UNICEF Assistant Representative in
Nigeria Mahera Khatun stressed the need for the government to
strengthen routine immunization as an entry point for effective
health service delivery.
"Your support during the immunization plus days this year will go a
long way in improving on immunization coverage in the northern parts
of the country where wild polio is a common disease among children,"
said the UN official.
Khatun attributed the disease to inadequate and non-functional
refrigerators for antigens in most local areas in the region. "Lack
of funds for vaccine movement from local government also contributed
largely to the existing problem in addition to reducing the routine
immunization coverage by less than 30 percent," she said.
According to Khatun, UNICEF has pledged to support the government
with cash and logistics to the tune of 107.9 million naira (about 830
000 U.S. dollars).
Polio is a highly infectious viral disease that chiefly affects
children and in its acute forms causes paralysis, muscular atrophy
and often deformity.
Between 1988 and 2004, global eradication efforts reduced the number
of polio cases from 350 000 annually to 1189 cases. In 2005, the
number of cases rose again to 1831 at the peak of the epidemic
originating in northern Nigeria and infecting 21 previously
polio-free countries between 2003 and 2005.

Analysis of 2006 year-to-date data indicates that some states in
northern Nigeria are recording a higher incidence of polio than at
the same time in each of the previous 3 years.
While 22 of Nigeria's 37 states have not reported polio in the past 6
months, the country as a whole has triple the number of cases it did
at this time in 2005. The 5 key states of Bauchi, Jigawa, Kaduna,
Kano, Katsina account for 80 percent of all cases in 2006 in Nigeria
and 56 percent of global cases. In these states, data collected
through the surveillance system suggests that immunization campaigns
continue to miss more than 40 percent of children. [Data from a graph
presented at the above URL link show annual incidence in the 6 most
endemic states in northern Nigeria (as of 18 Apr for each of the
years) expressed as cases per million population under age 5: Year
2002 - 2.61 cases; Year 2003 - 0.62 cases, Year 2004 - 4.1 cases;
Year 2005 - 2.11 cases, Year 2006 - 16.51 cases. A map of cases can
also be found at the above URL. - Mod.MPP]
Both federal and state authorities in Nigeria are giving increasing
and urgent attention to this data. A series of "Immunization Plus
Days," offering additional health interventions during polio
campaigns using a combination of mobile and fixed vaccinator teams,
have been planned for sub-national campaigns in May and June [2006].
In Kano state, a pilot phase for these IPDs were held from 24 Apr
[2006]. Kano expanded the extent of the pilot from one to 8 of the
metropolitan Local Government Areas -- the administrative units that
make up a state -- with the highest disease burden. Only trained
health workers provided the health interventions at the fixed sites.
With such high levels of transmission in these 5 key states, an
additional 12-18 months of intense activities may be required to
interrupt polio.
As countries enter the high season for polio transmission, WHO is
discussing risk mitigation strategies with countries bordering
Nigeria, including the possibility of additional preventive
supplementary polio immunization campaigns.

[The above reports seem to give different explanations for the
resurgence of polio this year in northern Nigeria. In the Xinhua
newswire [1], the focus is cold chain failure. The oral polio
vaccine (OPV) used in vaccination programs in much of the world is
temperature-sensitive; prolonged exposures to temperatures above 5
degrees centigrade will result in a loss of potency. The
standardized recommendations for storage and transportation of the
vaccine, including appropriate equipment, is referred to as the "cold chain."
In the second report from the polio eradication initiative website
[2], the increase in polio activity in northern Nigeria is being
attributed to a different type of vaccine failure... "failure to
vaccinate" -- leaving a large proportion of the population
susceptible to sustained transmission of the wild poliovirus.
The true picture may very well be a combination of both types of
vaccine failure -- poor-quality vaccine due to cold chain
deficiencies in some areas, combined with a failure to vaccinate
adequate numbers of the susceptible population (the polio eradication
initiative has set the minimum goal of 80 percent of the target
population at the district level). As a reminder, polio vaccination
activities were interrupted in northern Nigeria (especially Kano) for
almost a year during 2003-2004 due to internal political/religious
constraints. These barriers were theoretically resolved/lifted
thereafter, but from the low coverages reported above (approximately
60 percent), the resumption of vaccination is still inadequate to
interrupt transmission of the wild poliovirus (WPV). It is worth
noting that the 2nd report above indicates levels of WPV infection
4-fold higher in 2006 than in 2004, when vaccination ceased
altogether (2004). This suggests that a larger pool of susceptibles
has continued to accumulate, perhaps including a higher level of
vaccine failure due to cold chain deficiencies. Information on
vaccine efficacy in this region would be of great interest.
More detailed information on the epidemiology of polio in Nigeria can
be found at the WHO website:
<http://www.who.int/countries/nga/areas/polio/polio_stats_apr2806.pdf>.
In 2005, 73 percent of the cases reported were less than 3 years old,
77 percent had a history of receiving fewer than 3 doses of OPV, and
47 percent of cases received no OPV at all. This is a mixed
outbreak, involving 2 different types of WPV: WPV1 and WPV3. There
are excellent maps with scattergrams detailing where cases can be
found at this weblink. Another map of Nigeria with states can be
found at: <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf>.
Hopefully there will be a rapid resolution of the above discussed
obstacles to achieving interruption of WPV circulation in northern
Nigeria. - Mod.MPP]
