According to this report a joint commission of the Pan-American Foot and
Mouth Disease Center (Panaftosa) and experts from Brazil, Uruguay,
Argentina, and Bolivia will attend a collection of blood samples from
animals in several arms located in Paraguay on 14 Oct 2002.
The experts are interested not only in the San Francisco farm located in
Corpus Christi but also in farms belonging to Agropecuaria Principado e
Industrial Pirapo, located in Siete Quedas, close to the border with the
state of Mato Grosso do Sul in Brazil. The agreement was signed on 9 Oct
2002 in Rio do Janeiro, Brazil.
In another report also issued 10 Oct 2002 it said that the Pan-American
Foot and Mouth Disease Center can not confirm that blood samples taken from
a cattle herd from Paraguay are positive to Foot & Mouth Disease (FMD)
infection. Out of 420 samples tested, 12 were positive for FMD, but missing
information like identification number, sex and age of the animals precluded
confirmation [because they might have been vaccinated. - Mod.JW].
(Paraguay is listed as a country free of FMD with vaccination, so test
results should be interpreted carefully).
