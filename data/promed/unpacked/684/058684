Experts say drug works against monkeypox. A new drug may work against
monkeypox, a relative of smallpox that has caused a worrying outbreak in
Africa, health experts said on Tuesday. Researchers from the U.S. Army
Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) said the drug,
cidofovir, made by California-based Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD.O), prevented
death and disease in animals infected with monkeypox virus. Cidofovir
reduced respiratory symptoms, fever and pox-like skin lesions, said Dr. John
Huggins, who heads viral therapeutics at USAMRIID. "This is the first time
we have data in primates that confirm a drug's potential activity against
orthopoxvirus infections," Huggins told an infectious diseases meeting
sponsored by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
"The disease observed in primates infected with monkeypox is clinically
similar to what occurs in humans," he added. The next step would be to see
if the drug might work in humans. More than 500 people in the Democratic
Republic of Congo became ill in the largest ever reported outbreak of human
monkeypox last year. Five people, aged between 4 and 8, died. Monkeypox is a
sister virus of smallpox and is generally spread by squirrels and monkeys
in the rain forests of western and central Africa. Before the outbreak in
the Democratic Republic of Congo, cases of monkeypox in humans were rare.
