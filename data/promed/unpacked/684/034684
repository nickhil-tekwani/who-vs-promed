The Food Safety Authority is confident the first outbreak of a rare cattle
disease in more than 5 years has been confined to one farm in southern
Hawkes Bay. Beef measles cysts, which can lead to tape worms in humans,
were found in cattle from the farm about 13 months ago.
The authority's assistant director Glen Neal says the authority has no
concern there is any infected meat on the market. Neal says the authority
is confident that inspection systems identified the infection and its
source. He says the outbreak has not been kept secret, but there are some
sensitivities about the farmer's privacy.
Neal says the farm has undergone intensified inspection and any suspect
meat is frozen for 20 days to kill cysts.

Cattle disease outbreak kept secret
An outbreak of a rare cattle disease has been kept secret even though it
could have a devastating effect on farming.
A Hawke's Bay farm has been under strict movement control since beef
measles, which can lead to tapeworm in humans, was discovered in its cattle
13 months ago. It is the first major outbreak of the disease for at least
20 years, but local farmers and animal health officials have been kept in
the dark about the incident in the Dannevirke area.
Passed on to cattle from human feces, farmers face losing thousands of
dollars if stock gets infected by _Cysticercus bovis_, the larval stage
of human tapeworm. People then become infected if they eat contaminated meat.
The farmer at the center of the outbreak is believed to have already lost
more than NZD 25,000 [USD 13 450] in sales, with 53 animals from his farm
condemned by meat inspectors.
A prominent Dannevirke farmer, who did not want to be named, was surprised
not to have learned about the disease earlier and said, depending on the
herd size, it could be financially "devastating" for the affected business.
"It's not very good. If this condition is out there and a farm is under
some form of quarantine, we should know about it.
"Farmers would want to know how it happened and what was going to be done
about it, so if necessary they could take precautions to safeguard their
own stock."
Food Safety Authority (FSA) assistant director Glen Neal defended the
silence, claiming no other farms were under threat. However he admitted it
was "plausible" the parasite could be spread by birds and insects to other
pastures.
Officials discovered the beef measles, identifiable by large cysts in
organs and muscle, in a couple of animals in September 2001. 3 months
later, 16 cattle sent to slaughter from the same herd were also found to be
suffering from the condition. In the past year the farmer has been unable
to move cattle off his land and had to pay for more intensive inspections
at slaughterhouses and the mandatory freezing of all meat from carcasses
clear of cysts before it could be sold.
The FSA hopes to lift the restrictions later this year after seeing the
number of infected animals from the herd subside.
Despite the potential danger to neighboring farms, large parts of the
agricultural community have still not been told of the outbreak. "The
investigator would have taken such a risk into account and certainly no
other meat from the area has shown up to be infected," said Neal.
"This is our first ever outbreak of this size. If other farms were at risk,
as a matter of course they would be notified, but neighbours were not
informed of this incident, as it was considered unlikely they would have
been affected." He added that medical checks had been carried out on all
farm workers at the site to see if they were carrying the tapeworm.
Experts said beef measles posed no major health threat to cattle or humans
but claimed it was unusual for certain bodies not to be notified about the
case.
Local vet Mark Matthews, a member of the regional animal health committee,
said: "We haven't heard anything about it at all and anything like this we
would normally hear about, so it is interesting we haven't this time. I
don't think the presence of the disease is a big health issue though, as
even with humans, it is just unpleasant and can be treated quite easily."
The cause of the infection has not been found, but some have suggested an
infected tourist may have defecated in a field and grazing cattle then
picked up the disease.
Professor Roger Morris, an international animal disease expert from Massey
University, said it was unlikely contaminated water or using human sewage
to fertilize pasture would be to blame.
"It is very rare in this part of the world nowadays. It has possibly been
caused by a New Zealander carrying the parasite, but is more likely to be a
tourist who has relieved themselves on this unlucky farmer's land and
infected the cattle."
New Zealand had been free of the disease from 1998 to 2000, with only a
handful of cases in the years before.
Tom Lambie, Federated Farmers New Zealand president, sought to reassure
shoppers about meat standards. "It appears to be an isolated case and it
is good to see the system actually works. It has been picked up and dealt
with so quickly that the possibility of it spreading has been totally
contained. It means the New Zealand public can be assured of good quality
food."
Agricultural commentator Ron Clarke said: "It's an isolated disease and
does not really spread. It doesn't happen everyday but it certainly does
happen."

[The tape worm mentioned here is commonly called the beef tapeworm or
_Taenia sagginata_. Well cooked meat does not present a risk to consumers.
However, it is important to realize that the infection requires that the
meat is eaten undercooked or raw. _Taenia sagginata_ is not
life-threatening and can easily be treated. This tape worm is present
worldwide and is not something as terrible as these articles make it out to
be. - Mods.EP/TG]
