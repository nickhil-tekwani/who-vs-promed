I would like to respond to the posting titled "MOSQUITOES, POST
HURRICANE - USA (03)". In my opinion it needed some clarification
regarding birds as "reservoirs" of WNV, and I would like to add some
thoughts about possible hurricane effects on the WNV transmission
cycle.
Could a hurricane break the WNV transmission cycle?
It is very likely that Hurricane Katrina wiped out most of the
infected adult mosquitoes within the most heavily impacted areas.
Larval mosquitoes that get flushed into large bodies of deep water
become food for assorted predators or die from the increased water
salinity. The adult mosquitoes of the Culex species that are most
often associated with the amplification and transmission of West Nile
virus (WNV) typically shelter in low, enclosed areas (e.g., storm
sewers, crawl spaces, sheds, hollow logs, culverts, etc.), and they
would likely be drowned by the flood waters that came with the storm.
It is infected adult mosquitoes (not birds) that are actually the
local reservoirs of WNV, because these mosquitoes remain infected
until the end of their lives. Thus, if these older adult mosquitoes
are the local source of WNV infection, and they are mostly wiped out
by the storm, the local transmission cycle would be broken.
The birds that serve as temporary reservoirs of WNV actually include
many members of the order Passeriformes, not just crows. Furthermore,
birds are not really thought to be reservoirs of the virus; they are
amplifying hosts. When birds are infected with WNV, they remain
infected during a small window (approximately 4-5 days) during which
individuals of some species either remain healthy or become sick or
die. During that window of time, the infected birds may have
sufficient viremia to infect mosquitoes. However, by the end of that
period, the bird's immune system has either eliminated the virus from
the bloodstream, or the birds have died from the virus. In either
case, they would no longer be infectious to mosquitoes.
If the hurricane kills most of the local Culex mosquito population,
it may take time for new Culex to recolonize the area. By that time,
local birds would no longer be infectious to mosquitoes. Therefore,
it seems unlikely that there would be much WNV circulating in
mosquitoes in the hardest-hit areas of the Gulf Coast during the
weeks following the hurricane.

[I agree that adult _Culex_ mosquitoes such as the _Culex pipiens_
complex that can be vectors of West Nile virus often shelter in many
types of man-made constructions, including cellars, but I am not
convinced flooding would cause their death by drowning. I would
imagine that many would have flown away before their resting sites
became submerged in water. But this is speculation.
Regarding birds. Most publications regard birds as reservoir hosts of
West Nile virus despite the fact that -- in common with most rodents
and birds infected with an arbovirus -- viremia is short-lived,
usually a matter of a few days. If you go to most text books and
publication WN is said to have birds as reservoir hosts. Similarly
most websites cite birds as reservoirs, including the CDC
websites. I agree that infective mosquitoes will remain infective
until they die, but the duration their infective life may be very
short. However, there is evidence that WN virus can survive in some
hibernating mosquitoes. Ticks are much longer-lived than mosquitoes
and certain species seem to be capable of transmitting WN virus
amongst bird populations, and in such situations ticks as well as
birds could be considered reservoir hosts.
Yes, many other bird species besides corvids are infected, or have
the potential to be infected, with WN virus and some species appear
to be more important in the transmission cycle than corvids, but this
will depend on their local distribution.
As I have previously said it is difficult to guess exactly what the
repercussions will be in the weeks and months post hurricane Katrina.
