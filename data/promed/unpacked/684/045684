[1] CDC follow up report
Date: Fri 20 Aug 2010
Source: CDC [edited]
<http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/typhoidfever/index.html>


As of 9:00 am EDT on 20 Aug 2010, a total of 9 individuals infected
with a matching strain of _Salmonella [enterica_] serotype Typhi have
been reported from 2 states since 25 May 2010. The number of ill
persons identified in each state with this strain is as follows:
California (5) and Nevada (4).

Among persons with reported illness onset dates available, illnesses
began between 10 Apr 2010 and 25 Jul 2010. Infected individuals range
in age from 4 to 31 years old, and the median age is 21 years. 67
percent of cases are female and 100 percent report Hispanic
ethnicity. Among 9 patients with available clinical information, 7
(78 percent) were hospitalized. Eight (89 percent) of 9 patients
reported no international travel in the 60 days prior to illness
onset. As of 20 Aug 2010, no deaths attributed to this infection have
been reported.

CDC and public health officials in 2 states conducted an
epidemiologic study comparing foods eaten by ill and well persons.
Among interviewed ill persons, 7 (78 percent) of 9 reported consuming
frozen mamey fruit pulp in a milkshake or smoothie, also called a
"batido" or "licuado." Upon further investigation, it was found that
5 (71 percent) of 7 ill persons consumed Goya brand frozen mamey
fruit pulp. One person consumed La Nuestra brand frozen mamey fruit
pulp. Among well persons, 0 of 33 reported exposure to frozen mamey
fruit pulp. No other food was found to be associated with illness.
These results suggest that eating frozen mamey fruit pulp is a likely
source of these illnesses. CDC and its public health partners will
update the public on the progress of this investigation as
information becomes available.

Mamey, also called "zapote" or "sapote," is a tropical fruit grown
primarily in Central and South America. It is prepared by removing
the inner seed and consuming the flesh raw, or adding it to
milkshakes, jellies, or other foods or beverages. When preparing
frozen mamey fruit pulp, it is peeled and mashed and then consumed as
a shake or smoothie. Frozen mamey fruit pulp can be purchased in
grocery stores throughout the USA, and packages have a 2-3 year shelf life.

<http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm223383.htm>


As a precautionary measure, Montalvan's Sales, Inc. of Ontario,
California has voluntarily recalled "La Nuestra" brand frozen mamey
pulp due to a potential health risk from typhoid fever.

The recalled "La Nuestra" brand mamey pulp was distributed in the
states of Arizona, California, Nevada, Oregon and Utah through retail stores.

The La Nuestra brand mamey pulp comes in a 14-ounce plastic package.
All lot numbers are affected by this recall, however packages
produced prior to May 2009 are not identified with a lot number and
are subject to this recall as well. The UPC is 7-56869-10008-4.

This recall was initiated after Montalvan's Sales, Inc. was notified
by FDA and CDC that the affected product is potentially implicated
via a strong epidemiologic link to a recent outbreak of typhoid fever
in several western states.

[Since _S._ Typhi is not a zoonotic pathogen, the fruit was either
contaminated by sewage or directly by chronic carriers during
preparation. - Mod.LL]
