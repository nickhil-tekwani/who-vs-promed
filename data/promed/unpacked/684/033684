[This moderator has questioned why media reports of suspected YF
cases in South America say lab confirmation tests take weeks to
produce a result. Arbovirus diagnostic expert (and former ProMED
virus disease moderator) Charlie Calisher provides the following
explanation. - Mod.JW]

Laboratory diagnosis of yellow fever virus infections in humans and
other vertebrates
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The flaviviruses (family _Flaviviridae_, genus _Flavivirus_) have
been called "a Hall of Mirrors" because many of them are so
cross-reactive in antigenic/serologic tests that it is difficult or
impossible to determine with which virus one is working and yellow
fever virus (YFV) vaccine only complicates the diagnostic picture (1).

In the early years of laboratory diagnosis of YFV infection,
hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) was used to detect antibody. This
test is not specific for YFV virus infection; HI detects
cross-reacting antibody to other flaviviruses. Nonetheless, because
YFV is only distantly related to most other flaviviruses, detection
of HI antibody can be used as a primary screening tool.

Complement-fixation (CF) tests are less sensitive (lower titers) than
are HI tests but are more specific than HI tests. Positive reactions
by either test require confirmation by still other tests, such as
neutralization (N). Whereas the former 2 tests can provide a result
within hours, the latter takes as long as a week or more to rule out
heterologous reactivity; i.e., infection with a flavivirus other than
YFV, and N antibody to YFV may persist for many decades.

Immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) tests also are useful (2) and can
be easily adapted to detect either IgM (early response) or IgG (later
response) antibody to the virus. IFA tests can be done with tissues
from the human or other vertebrate at autopsy or necropsy or with
invertebrates (suspected vectors), or done with cell cultures in
which the virus has been amplified. It should be recognized, however,
that tests of samples containing live virus and manipulation of
specimens containing live virus pose hazards to the unimmunized
laboratory worker.

In recent decades, IgM capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
(MACELISA) have been used with considerable success. Either serum or
cerebrospinal fluids can be tested this assay, as they can by other
tests) and the presence of IgM antibody to YFV is at least
provisional evidence for a recent infection with that virus. Still,
confirmations by other tests are required for assurance and paired
acute- and convalescent-phase serum samples are necessary to
demonstrate a significant (usually 4-fold or greater) rise or fall in
antibody titer.

Detection of Councilman bodies by microscopic examination of liver
tissue from humans has been used by pathologists to diagnose
infection with YFV. Councilman bodies are acidophilic inclusion
bodies in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes but this method is not at all
specific for YF because such cells may be seen in tissues from
patients with a variety of virus infections, autoimmune hepatitis, or
hereditary hepatitis.

Whereas serologic evidence for YF virus infection, whether by
MACELISA, IFA, HI, CF, N or other assays, is often taken as
confirmatory when done properly and with paired samples, detection of
YFV or of YFV RNA provides greater certainty. Thus, use of PCR (4, 5)
or antigen detection assays (6) is favored when lives and time are of
the essence and a guaranteed diagnosis is needed. In addition,
obtaining a virus by isolation (cell cultures, suckling mice, other
laboratory hosts) provides one with a biological entity that can be
amplified for later studies.

Under emergency epidemic or possible epidemic conditions, the best
test is the one that (a) is available, and (b) will provide a result
quickly, specifically, and inexpensively. The practicality of the
situation always requires a good clinical appraisal, a rapid test,
and leaving the sophisticated details for later. Use of a poor or
non-specific test will be misleading and may cost lives and waste
time and money.

Finally, an unconscionable delay (i.e., any unnecessary delay) in
making a proper diagnosis of YF is unacceptable.
