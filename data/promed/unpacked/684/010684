The team of experts in the Ebola response told the presidency of the Republic this evening [30 Jul 2019] of the discovery of a 2nd case of Ebola in Goma (North Kivu). This is a gold digger who came last night [29 Jul 2019] from Mongwalu, about 70 km [about 43.5 mi] from Bunia (Ituri). He has been taken care of and is isolated, announced a presidential source to Actualite.CD.

"The population is out of danger. The situation is under control. All contacts have already been identified," Giscard Kusema, deputy director of the presidential press, told Actualite.CD.

[The 1st confirmed Ebola case in Goma was a 46-year-old pastor who successfully passed through 3 health checkpoints on the way from Butembo. This 2nd Ebola case arrived on 13 Jul 2019 from a mining area in northeastern Congo's Ituri province and started showing symptoms on 22 Jul 2019. He is now isolated at an Ebola treatment center in Goma. We await more information on this case and possible exposures as he spent time in Ituri province and Goma. - Mod.LK]

A 2nd case of Ebola was detected on [Tue 30 Jul 2019] in the eastern Congolese city of Goma, a local health official said, increasing concern the virus could establish a foothold in the densely populated area close to the Rwandan border.

Goma's 1st Ebola case was detected in mid-July [2019], prompting the World Health Organisation (WHO) to warn that the spread of the disease could accelerate. The epidemic has killed more than 1700 people since it was declared almost a year ago, becoming the 2nd-worst outbreak on record.

The latest person with the disease started developing symptoms on [22 Jul 2019] after arriving from a mining area outside the city, the health official quoted the head of Congo's Ebola response team, Jean-Jacques Muyembe, as saying in an official statement.

Health officials believe the patient, a man, is not connected to the 1st case in Goma.

"The response teams continue to work to decontaminate the home of the case and the high-risk contacts of the case have been identified and will be vaccinated from tomorrow," Muyembe said.

He said, unlike the 1st case, the latest patient will be able to receive appropriate treatment in Goma as a facility has been opened in the city, which is more than 350 kilometers [about 217.5 mi] south of where the outbreak was first detected.

Goma has been preparing for Ebola to arrive in the city for a year, setting up hand-washing stations and making sure motorcycle-taxi drivers do not share helmets.

DRC has issued the #Ebola update for Mon 29 Jul 2019 & the weekly situation report from @WHOAFRO is out. So, a thread:

There were +16 cases & +13 deaths, 8 of which were community deaths. To date 2690 people have been infected & 1803 people have died.

The DRC #Ebola report also mentions authorities are looking for an Ebola case in Lubero who was confirmed on [25 Jul 2019] but who is missing.

Nosocomial (in hospital) transmission remains a problem, especially in Beni and Mabalako. Lax infection control practices are dangerous for patients & health workers alike.

DRC sees cases surge as Ebola outbreak hits 1-year mark
-------------------------------------------------------
This week, the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC's) North Kivu and Ituri provinces will hit the 1-year anniversary of its start, but a surge of cases over the weekend [27-28 Jul 2019] gives little hope the outbreak is close to contained.

Since the end of last week, the DRC has recorded 41 more cases of the deadly virus, including 12 cases confirmed today. According to the World Health Organization's (WHO's) online Ebola dashboard, the outbreak total now stands at 2671 cases. The dashboard also recorded a total of 1782 deaths, an increase in 20 fatalities over the weekend [see ProMED-mail Ebola update (72): Congo DR (NK,IT) case update, summary, response, research 20190729.6594431].

So far the DRC president's office, which last week shifted outbreak response activities to its technical group, has not issued any detailed daily updates following the resignation of the country's health minister.

UN steps up efforts in South Sudan, DRC
---------------------------------------
As the outbreak marches on, UNICEF, the United Nation's (UN's) children fund, announced it was ramping up efforts in South Sudan, suggesting the country is vulnerable to cross-border infections. Earlier this month [July 2019], Uganda was the 1st country to see 3 imported cases of Ebola, in an outbreak that was quickly controlled -- in part, UNICEF said, because of early detection and community education.

In a news release, UNICEF said it is training 450 front-line mobilizers who are engaging in education campaigns across South Sudan.

"With Ebola closer to South Sudan than before, we have no time to lose. We need to be prepared to deal with an outbreak in the country, but first and foremost we must do everything we possibly can to stop the disease from reaching South Sudan," said Mohamed Ag Ayoya, MD, UNICEF's representative in South Sudan.

"The active involvement of communities is key to avoid infections. We are working closely with them to create awareness and understanding of transmission routes, and promoting handwashing and good hygiene practices, which are the most effective prevention measures."

UNICEF said it needed USD 4.3 million to fully fund Ebola prevention and preparedness activities in South Sudan through the end of September [2019].

Also, late last week the UN's World Food Program (WFP) announced it plans to double food assistance to people affected by the DRC Ebola outbreak, according to UN News. The ramp-up will occur over the next 6 months, and is targeted at case contacts, cases, and suspected cases.

WFP's spokesperson Herve Verhoosel said the group is preparing for an escalation of the outbreak.

"Food distributions are key to the containment effort, helping as they do to limit the movement of people who could spread the disease, and to the vital vaccination drive," Verhoosel said. According to estimates, the WFP said each new case is expected to have roughly 50 new contacts, which equals a total of 75 000 contacts in the next 5 months.

WFP said it need USD 50 million over the next 6 months to implement its response and preparedness actions in the DRC, as well as Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and South Sudan.

[According to Voice of America (VOA), the United Nations' Children's Fund (UNICEF), reports an unprecedented number of children have been infected in this outbreak. Children account for more than 700 of the 2671 reported cases of Ebola. UNICEF health specialist Jerome Pfaffman said more than half of the youngsters infected are below the age of 5 (https://www.voanews.com/science-health/congo-confirms-2nd-ebola-case-border-city-goma). This is one of the more tragic aspects of this outbreak. - Mod.LK]

[3] Vaccine

https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/ebola-vaccine-use-in-congo-slowed-by-distrust-/5016717.html


WHO officials say as many as 90 percent of those able to get the vaccine accepted it. But that percentage only includes people who gave contact tracers enough information to be put on a list. The success rate does not include those who distrusted health workers and fled or could not be found.

Contact lists have failed simply because people have avoided health workers. A religious leader used a false name at health checkpoints to avoid being found, for example. He became the 1st Ebola case in Goma. The leader had been sickened in one town and took a bus while ill.

The WHO and the Congolese health ministry now are offering the vaccine to anyone who wants it.

With Ebola's arrival in Goma, some wonder whether there will be enough vaccines if the outbreak continues. Goma is a city of more than 2 million people.

The vaccine's maker, Merck, said it has 245 000 1-millileter doses. That could rise to 900 000 over the next 18 months. The dose in Congo also has been reduced to 0.5 milliliters, which doubles the number of available vaccines.

The new plan of giving the vaccine to anyone who wants it involves setting up sites in neighborhoods most affected.
