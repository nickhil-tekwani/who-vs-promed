The infectious disease department says cases of other sexually transmitted diseases [STDs] are fluctuating, but syphilis cases are going up, including those that are resistant to antibiotics. As you spend time with your loved one this Valentine's Day [14 Feb 2014], the University of Kansas Hospital is testing for STDs.

Some call it a mood killer to discuss STDs on Valentine's Day, but health officials say it's the perfect time. "It's more of a mood killer when you have to go in because you're having symptoms of illness," Dr Dana Hawkinson said.

Area health officials are seeing a rise in syphilis cases in just about every age group. "We know that there have been elevated rates that can be found in nursing homes as well," Dr Hawkinson said. Jeff Hershberger with the Kansas City Health Department echoed Dr Hawkinson's observations. "With this we're seeing it as young as teenagers and on up through senior citizens," Hershberger said.

We spoke with the health department about the recent number of cases for all STDs. The numbers are significantly higher for the other STDs; however, syphilis has seen the highest jump with over a 100 percent increase.

The University of Kansas Hospital isn't sure of a reason for the increase, but Hershberger thinks it's because syphilis symptoms can go away, and then return, leaving an infected person with a false sense of well-being. "With syphilis they may get a sore early that goes away and think everything is fine, and then it shows up as a rash," he said.

Even though there is treatment, the University of Kansas Hospital is starting to see more strains that are resistant to antibiotics. You're urged to know your status, practice safe sex, and be honest with your partner if you're sick.

A quick side note: Penicillin, the most common treatment for syphilis, was discovered on Valentine's Day in 1928.

[Kansas City, Missouri and Kansas City, Kansas are adjacent cities on either side of the border that divides these 2 states in the central United States. The news report above seems to be originating from Kansas City, Missouri, but the sexually transmitted disease (STD) statistics may be likely that of the Kansas City metropolitan area that combines both cities. The principal city of the area is Kansas City, Missouri, with a population of 2.34 million; Kansas City, Kansas has a population of 145 786 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_metropolitan_area).

The news article above reports an increase in incidence of syphilis of over 100 percent in Kansas City, but it does not say over what period of time, or characterize its epidemiology, except to say that it is occurring at all ages. However, a prior report posted by ProMED-mail in 2013 (Syphilis - USA (04): (MO) higher incidence, young men, urban 20130818.1887009) noted that syphilis is occurring there mainly among younger men, as has been reported elsewhere in the US and in many parts of the rest of the world (see previous ProMED-mail postings listed below) and, although not specifically mentioned, may likely be occurring among men who have sex with men (MSM). In the US in 2012, 75 percent of the reported primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis cases were among MSM (http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/). However, although the majority of US syphilis cases have occurred among MSM, outbreaks among men who have sex with women only (MSW) and women continue to occur in certain jurisdictions (See previous ProMED-mail posts below and http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats12/syphilis.htm).

The news report above mentions that the University of Kansas Hospital is starting to see more strains of _Treponema pallidum_, the microorganism that causes syphilis, that are resistant to antibiotics. Unlike many other bacterial pathogens, resistance of _T. pallidum_ to antimicrobial drugs cannot be determined by the ability of a drug to inhibit growth or killing the organism in vitro, because _T. pallidum_ cannot be cultured in vitro. Instead, drug resistance has been inferred by treatment failure in people and in experimental animal models of syphilis, by use of an in vitro assay to assess the effect of certain antibiotics on treponemal protein synthesis or motility, or by use of molecular methods to identify the presence of genes that encode drug resistance (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2812177/).

Penicillin G, administered parenterally, is the only preferred drug currently recommended by the CDC for treating all stages of syphilis (http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/genital-ulcers.htm#syphilis). Doxycycline and tetracycline given orally for 14 days, ceftriaxone parenterally for 10-14 days, and azithromycin (a macrolide antibiotic) as a single 2 g oral dose are considered alternate therapy of early syphilis in many situations (http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/genital-ulcers.htm#syphilis).

Despite over 60 years of extensive clinical use of penicillin, penicillin resistance has not yet emerged in _T. pallidum_. Most serologically defined treatment failures are thought to be due to reinfection or to patient-to-patient variation in the decline of nontreponemal test titers after penicillin treatment (that is, 4-fold decrease or greater), rather than to relapse, which is rare (Stamm LV: Global challenge of antibiotic-resistant _Treponema pallidum_. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2010; 54(2): 583-9; available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2812177/).

However, chromosomal mutations associated with azithromycin resistance have been widely documented among strains of _T. pallidum_, and treatment failures have been reported, perhaps because extensive azithromycin use for unrelated infections (for example, oral, skin, respiratory, and genital infections) has provided a selective pressure for the increased prevalence of macrolide-resistant _T. pallidum_ (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2812177/). For example, the percentage of clinical specimens of _T. pallidum_ containing chromosomal mutations associated with azithromycin resistance have reached in 2005 76.5 percent in San Francisco and 56 percent in Seattle (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2812177/). Consequently, the CDC recommends azithromycin should be used with caution only when treatment with penicillin or doxycycline is not feasible (http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/genital-ulcers.htm#syphilis).

To date, there is no documented resistance of _T. pallidum_ to doxycycline. Decreased use of azithromycin may result in increased use of doxycycline as an alternative drug for syphilis, possibly putting selective pressure for emergence of doxycycline resistance in the future (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2812177/). - Mod.ML
