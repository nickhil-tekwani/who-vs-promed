--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The scale of chronic ill health and disability after COVID-19 has been described as the next big global health challenge. Prevalence estimates of a post-COVID-19 condition, long COVID, or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 vary according to definition, methodology, and population. A recent systematic review reported persistent symptoms at 3-6 months in a median of 57% (range 13-92) of hospitalised patients (6 studies) and 26% (2-62) of non-hospitalised patients (10 studies). This study and other reviews identified few studies from low-income settings, but with more than 245 million SARS-CoV-2 infections reported globally, millions of people are likely to already be experiencing long-term illness. While COVID-19 vaccines have reduced the risk of severe COVID-19 and death, continued high rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection will lead to further disability, having a huge impact on individuals, their families, health services, and society.

Patients coined the unifying term long COVID, but there is not yet a health professional consensus definition or nomenclature. In October 2021, WHO used a Delphi method to develop a clinical definition of post-COVID-19 condition as a range of symptoms occurring 3 or more months after probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection that last for at least 2 months, cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis, generally have an impact on daily functioning, and may fluctuate or relapse over time. A separate definition is recommended for children. Other definitions use different time frames and terminology but remain difficult to apply in research and clinical management.

Long COVID has many characteristic symptoms, including post-exertional symptom exacerbation, severe fatigue, breathlessness, tachycardia, cognitive deficits, and dysautonomia. However, the absence of specific diagnostic criteria means that clinicians and patients must live with substantial uncertainty, with the risk that people will be either overinvestigated and overtreated or not receive adequate support.

A hidden epidemic of long COVID is possible given the challenges in access to care and uncertainty about diagnostic criteria -- factors that will differ in their importance between low-income and high-income settings. Patients report not being taken seriously by medical practitioners or refused referral to long COVID services. These services remain limited and where they exist vary in scope, quality, and access to some therapeutic options. In the absence of diagnostic tests, long COVID is partly a diagnosis of exclusion, creating challenges for patients and carers. Previous diagnoses of exclusion, such as chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and irritable bowel syndrome, are now better defined than in the past, meaning patients are more able to obtain acknowledgment, treatment, sick pay, or insurance.

Data from high-income countries suggest that ongoing symptoms after acute COVID-19 can occur irrespective of initial disease severity and are more prevalent in women, middle-aged and older adults, people with pre-existing health conditions, and those admitted to hospital with acute COVID-19, although the latter might also reflect post-intensive care syndrome. However, the pathophysiology of long COVID remains poorly understood with different mechanisms probably explaining the heterogeneous symptoms, including viral persistence, autoimmunity due to molecular mimicry, aberrant T-cell and humoral responses, and micro-thrombi. Understanding the mechanisms and natural history of long COVID will inform diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, building on experience of other post-viral syndromes -- e.g., careful pacing in rehabilitation to avoid post-exertional symptom exacerbation. To date, no antiviral or immunomodulatory drug has proven effective for the treatment of long COVID in trials. Some preliminary reports suggest COVID-19 vaccination might improve symptoms in some people, supporting the notion of a possible role for persistent viral reservoirs, circulating virus fragments, or both in long COVID.

Ideally, patients with this complex disease process which affects multiple systems should be assessed by a medical generalist with access to diagnostic tools and relevant multidisciplinary teams, but globally decentralised community services will be more sustainable in a COVID-19-endemic world. Robin Gorna and colleagues, writing as individuals with lived experience of long COVID, advise that "psychological aspects of disease should be managed as part of the recovery process, but not seen as the primary treatment focus for all." As with most chronic disease, a holistic approach and individualised rehabilitation plan will be crucial. Reliable online and other resources are needed to ensure that clinicians, researchers, and patients can keep up to date with the latest evidence on long COVID in a rapidly evolving field. Yet these resources will be beyond what is available in many health systems, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs).

COVID-19 has exacerbated existing inequities and created new vulnerabilities, especially in low-resource settings, and long COVID is amplifying these disparities. Countries with limited resources and already overwhelmed health systems are unlikely to be able to provide specific services for long COVID, which will therefore remain hidden. Surveillance of this emerging public health threat must be a priority globally, and we support the need for national registers, with chronic cases reported alongside infections, hospitalisations, and deaths. Large-scale multinational partnerships, including LMIC researchers, patients, and funding, are needed to evaluate evidence-based diagnostics and therapeutics and assure affordability, applicability, and adaptability to different health-care systems, including in resource-limited contexts. Such collaborative efforts should lead to greater understanding of disease mechanisms and treatments for long COVID, improving lived experience of the millions of people with this condition around the world.

Abstract
--------
SARS-CoV-2 remdesivir resistance mutations have been generated in vitro but have not been reported in patients receiving treatment with the antiviral agent. We present a case of an immunocompromised patient with acquired B-cell deficiency who developed an indolent, protracted course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Remdesivir therapy alleviated symptoms and produced a transient virologic response, but her course was complicated by recrudescence of high-grade viral shedding. Whole genome sequencing identified a mutation, E802D, in the nsp12 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase which was not present in pre-treatment specimens. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the mutation conferred an ~6-fold increase in remdesivir IC50 but resulted in a fitness cost in the absence of remdesivir. Sustained clinical and virologic response was achieved after treatment with casirivimab-imdevimab. Although the fitness cost observed in vitro may limit the risk posed by E802D, this case illustrates the importance of monitoring for remdesivir resistance and the potential benefit of combinatorial therapies in immunocompromised patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Also from Jason Gale at Bloomberg: "Resistance to Gilead Sciences Inc.'s antiviral remdesivir was found in coronavirus samples collected from an immune-compromised patient treated with the drug for a persistent COVID-19 infection, researchers said. Similar mutations causing resistance have been generated in lab studies, but haven't been previously reported in patients treated with the injectable medicine, Shiv Gandhi, Akiko Iwasaki and colleagues at the Yale University School of Medicine said. The patient, a woman in her 70s who had been treated for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, caught COVID in May 2020. Remdesivir helped alleviate symptoms but wasn't able to completely clear the infection. It persisted for several months, affecting her sense of smell.

"Genetic analysis of the virus showed that it acquired a mutation during treatment that appeared to reduce the effectiveness of the drug, the first cleared for COVID-19. The infection was successfully treated with monoclonal antibody therapy, which also led to a recovery of her sense of smell.

"'While the finding is limited to a single case and requires confirmation of its generalizability in larger patient populations, it suggests that remdesivir can impart selective pressure' in patients to drive evolution of the virus, the researchers said in a study, which was released on medRxiv ahead of peer-review and publication.

"The scientists found the mutation, called E802D, reduced the fitness of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. They said the case illustrates the importance of monitoring for remdesivir resistance and the potential benefit of using a combination of therapies in immunocompromised patients" (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-11/mutation-linked-to-remdesivir-resistance-found-in-covid-patient.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Patients with immunosuppression are at risk for prolonged infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In several case reports, investigators have indicated that multimutational SARS-CoV-2 variants can arise during the course of such persistent cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These highly mutated variants are indicative of a form of rapid, multistage evolutionary jumps (saltational evolution), which could preferentially occur in the milieu of partial immune control. The presence of a large number of mutations is also a hallmark of the variants of concern -- including B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), P.1 (gamma), and B.1.617.2 (delta) -- which suggests that viral evolution in immunocompromised patients may be an important factor in the emergence of such variants. Since a large number of persons globally are living with innate or acquired immunosuppression, the association between immunosuppression and the generation of highly transmissible or more pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 variants requires further delineation and mitigation strategies.

"Rapid viral evolution has been described in immunosuppressed patients with persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Choi et al. described an immunosuppressed patient with antiphospholipid syndrome who was hospitalized in August 2020 and treated with anticoagulants, glucocorticoids, cyclophosphamide, intermittent rituximab, and eculizumab. During 152 days of persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection in this patient, the investigators identified 31 substitutions and 3 deletions in genome sequences. Twelve spike mutations were found, including 7 in a segment of the receptor-binding domain consisting of 24 amino acids, some at sites linked to immune evasion (478, 484, and 493). The patient eventually died of severe COVID-19-related pneumonia. In another immunocompromised patient, Kemp and colleagues analyzed SARS-CoV-2 sequences at 23 time points over 101 days. Viral diversification was limited during the first 2 months but subsequently increased after the patient received an infusion of convalescent plasma on days 63 and 65, leading to rapid shifts in the frequency of the different variants. As such, sequences that were sampled on days 89, 93, and 102 showed distinct combinations of spike mutations. Truong et al. recently described the cases of 3 patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (including one with B-cell aplasia) after the receipt of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. These patients were found to have multiple escape variants over the course of persistent COVID-19 infection. Some case reports have not identified highly divergent variants but have documented variants with mutations (e.g., V483A1-4 and E484K8) that alter antibody recognition."

"The recent demonstration of the use of combination monoclonal antibodies for preventing SARS-CoV-2 acquisition in nursing homes and home settings suggests that passive antibody prophylaxis may be another approach for immunosuppressed patients who do not have an adequate immune response to vaccination or for patients and their family members with high-risk exposure. Monoclonal antibodies with mutations in the Fc portion of the formulation that extend the half-life and the likely effective concentration for several months or that enhance the effective immune clearance of SARS-CoV-2 may be an alternative form of COVID-19 prevention for immunocompromised patients who do not have a response to a vaccine. Monoclonal antibodies have already been approved for emergency use as treatment for high-risk persons and can reduce disease progression, viral load, and the duration of viral shedding. However, variants of concern have shown in vitro escape from some monoclonal antibodies, including bamlanivimab and casirivimab. (The latter along with imdevimab constitutes the REGN-COV2 antibody cocktail.) The effects of these mutations on clinical outcomes among immunocompromised patients are not known. New monoclonal antibodies that are resistant to the current recognized mutations are in development.

"Antiviral agents that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication offer an alternative mechanism of protection that should be unaffected by mutations that compromise monoclonal antibodies. Molnupiravir (EIDD-2801) was reported to suppress replication of SARS-CoV-2 in 203 patients with early infection, and 2 larger clinical trials are in progress (ClinicalTrials.gov numbers NCT04575584 and NCT04575597); whether antiviral escape variants emerge remains to be defined. Stopping the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in a compromised host by means of an effective monoclonal antibody or small molecule offers an opportunity to halt the development of mutations and the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to close contacts. Strategies to ensure that appropriate selection and monitoring for rapid detection of resistance to these therapies will become a key part of medical and public health management.

"Viral adaptation to the human host and viral escape variants are a threat to patient health and COVID-19 pandemic control. Scientific attention to the intersection of SARS-CoV-2 biologic features, host immunologic characteristics, and the unique concerns of immunocompromised hosts is warranted. Additional considerations for immunization and other mitigation strategy guidelines for immunocompromised patients and their close contacts are also needed." - Mod.LK]

[3] Papua New Guinea
Date: Thu 11 Nov 2021

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/11/11/png-caught-between-covid-and-vaccine-sceptics-in-pandemic-battle


International concerns are mounting as COVID-19 continues to sweep through unvaccinated Papua New Guinea (PNG) where, according to Our World in Data website, only 1.7% of its population has been fully vaccinated.

The vaccination rate remains abysmally low, despite adequate vaccine supplies and aid from the Australian government and international organisations such as the Red Cross. The slow takeup has been in part due to poor government messaging and the proliferation of misinformation on social media via mobile phones. "There is a lot of misinformation around circulating largely from social media," Jane Holden, Western Highlands Provincial Health Authority acting CEO, told Al Jazeera.

While inaccurate social media messaging about the COVID-19 vaccines has plagued nations worldwide -- including Australia where there have been rallies against vaccines -- Holden says that the key issue in Papua New Guinea is that there is a lack of access to factual media messaging.

"People do have access to social media more so than it would appear who can listen to the radio or read newspapers or see TV," she said. "So, their phones are very important, and people are reading a lot of misinformation on their phones."

Holden says that the misinformation is not necessarily just a belief in conspiracy theories, but a misunderstanding about how the vaccine works. "People say 'don't get the vaccine because you can still get COVID, so what's the point'."

The diverse nation -- home to more than 700 language groups -- presents numerous challenges for health administrators, not only the mountainous terrain and lack of reliable transport routes but also low levels of formal education and existing health challenges, including HIV, tuberculosis and low life expectancy.

Holden told Al Jazeera that while the region her team operates in has decent roads, "we do have some hard-to-reach places that we need to chopper teams into. "Where we think we can go by road, we find sometimes we can't get there, so we have to organise people to ford rivers and then get another vehicle somehow from the other side and then just keep going on."

"There are challenges in actually getting to villages or people living in villages, of course, getting to us."

In the small village of Kuntika, in the remote Western Highlands, community leader Eric Eribiang recently managed to oversee the vaccination of 72 people. He agrees that the mixed messaging on social media has contributed to vaccine hesitancy.

"Now with social media, people have access to internet," he told Al Jazeera. "So, there is mixed feeling with people posting negative things about the vaccine. Actually, people are not getting the right message because of the propaganda." Such "propaganda" includes western social media messaging that the vaccine is a conspiracy to make people sick, along with anti-vaccine messaging propagated by some local church groups.

However, Eribiang says his status as the son of a chief and community leader was vital in communicating the importance of vaccinations. "Being the chief's son, I am able to have influence and talk and lead in the province," he said.

Eribiang worked closely with the Western Highlands Health Service to administer the vaccinations in Kuntika, and the initiative has so far helped keep COVID-19 at bay in the remote community of fewer than 1000 people. About half of them are under the age of 18 and not yet eligible for the jab under the country's vaccine programme.

He argues that the key to building trust around vaccines and coronavirus education is having the right people tasked with the job. Building awareness and educating the public is an important role but at the same time you need to have the right people to do it," he said. "People who have influence in the society and people who could look up to them. It's better than having another person from another place come and try to build awareness."

Former Australian High Commissioner to Papua New Guinea, Ian Kemish, says that the issue is part of broader underinvestment in health services across the country of 9 million people. Despite being rich with resources, Human Rights Watch notes that 80% of the population lives in rural areas and 40% lives in poverty faced with challenges such as domestic violence and tribal warfare. Traditional beliefs, including sorcery, remain deep-rooted.

The human rights group noted in April 2020 -- the beginning of the pandemic -- that the country had only 500 doctors, fewer than 4000 nurses and only about 5000 beds in hospitals and health centres. "There has been underinvestment by the PNG government in the health system for a long time now," Kemish said. "PNG is a country that's seen some of the most rapid population growth since it received independence in 1975 so health services just haven't kept up. So, the country is starting from behind already."

Kemish adds that Papua New Guinea is following a trend seen worldwide, in which vaccine takeup is low in countries where government engagement, and trust in government, are low. He says there is "a correlation between low vaccination rates on one hand and countries where either trust in government or engagement with government is pretty low on the other."

Yet this low engagement is exacerbated in Papua New Guinea, where he said the government "is not very present in peoples' lives." "People live remotely. And yet, Papua New Guineans do have access through smartphones to Facebook," he said.

Kemish is also the chairman of the Kokoda Track Foundation, a Papua New Guinean-based charity. The group recently worked with UN children's agency UNICEF and Papua New Guinea Department of Health to deliver vaccines to the small mountainous village of Kokoda.

He says that the challenges of mountainous terrain and remote villages can be surmounted to deliver vaccinations, "but you've got to have people who are willing to be injected. It's not jabs that are in short supply, it's actually arms," he said.

Vaccinations have been supplied under the COVAX programme and also through donations from countries such as Australia. Medical aid has also been provided, with teams from the UK and Australia assisting Holden's staff in Mount Hagen.

However, Holden is fearful that people will only come forward for the jab after an increase in COVID-19 deaths. PNG has reported 415 deaths from the disease but is battling a renewed surge in the virus that began last month [October 2021]. "There is no doubt that people dying in villages appears to be a driver towards reducing vaccine hesitancy," she said.

While the Papua New Guinea Ministry of Health did not respond to Al Jazeera's requests for comment, its website contains information about COVID-19, the pandemic and vaccines. Holden and Eribiang say the information needs to be disseminated more widely not only via social media but also by people visiting remote areas.

"We need to make sure people know where to go to get the information they need," said Holden. "Each of us in the provinces need to be very, very focused on giving people clear messages out and being out in the villages so we can talk to people and talk to people about what fears they've got and try and bring the facts."

Community leader Eribiang agrees that spreading the right message is key to avoiding a catastrophe. "The awareness needs to go out clearly so people need to be aware of the facts surrounding COVID and the vaccine," he said. "When they get the true story, they will be able to decide for themselves whether to get the vaccine or not."
