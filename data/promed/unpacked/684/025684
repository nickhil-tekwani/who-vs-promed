Since the beginning of the year, Kenya has reported 277 visceral leishmaniasis, or kala-azar cases, including 7 deaths from 2 counties; Marsabit County in the mid-north of the country and Wajir County in the east of Kenya, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

Last month [June 2017], officials from the National Kala-azar Programme in Nairobi and WHO visited Marsabit County to provide on-the-ground support. The Ministry also dispatched testing kits and medical supplies to the kala-azar-affected counties in Wajir and Marsabit.

Leishmaniasis is caused by a protozoan parasite transmitted by the bite of infected phlebotomine sandflies, and often linked to environmental changes such as deforestation, building of dams, irrigation schemes, and urbanization. The disease is endemic in Kenya, with most cases presenting with a cutaneous form of the disease - causing facial ulcers, disfiguring scars and disability.

The most severe form of the disease (visceral leishmaniasis [VL]) attacks the internal organs and, if left untreated, can be fatal in more than 95 percent of cases within 2 years of onset. There is, therefore, an urgent need to expand the number of screening, diagnostics and treatment sites to improve access to health services within affected communities.

The Ministry of Health and partners, however, face numerous challenges in responding to this outbreak. Some of the challenges include limited equipment and chemicals for vector control, inconsistent supply of commodities (anti-leishmanial drugs are mostly produced by a single manufacturer), limited capacity for laboratory diagnostics, inadequate number of trained personnel in the rapid response teams, and inadequate resources for health promotion and community engagement, outreach activities and mass education. Moreover, the response efforts are being stretched by the concurrent outbreaks of cholera, dengue and measles, as well as the ongoing drought-induced humanitarian crisis within the country.

[A recent review of leishmaniasis worldwide including Kenya (Leishmaniasis worldwide and global estimates of its incidence. Alvar J et al and the WHO Leishmaniasis Control Team. PLoS One. 2012;7(5):e35671; Suppl. 50), states that in Kenya "Since 1980, the number of reported cases increased considerably and expanded into new areas. In Baringo and Pokot area, there is a continuous high endemicity, which affects the very poor tribal nomadic population. In other areas, VL occurs in outbreaks that are associated with periods of drought, when the rate of malnutrition is high. The outbreaks are probably related to people movement from high to low endemic areas due to the lack of food security."

In recent years, ProMED has reported on the high rate of visceral leishmaniasis in South Sudan and there may be a link through population movements to the cases in Northern Kenya. - Mod.EP]
