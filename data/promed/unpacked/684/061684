I must reply to this obviously sincere message. I have read studies granted,
they are case studies and not large-scale controlled trials) that indicate a
possible causal link between Hep B vaccination and Multiple Sclerosis (eg.,
Nadler, J.P.; Multiple Sclerosis and Hepatitis B Vaccination; Clinical
Infectous Diseases, 1993; 17:928-929). Before dismissing the connection that
is only guessed at now between Hep B vaccine and MS, there should be long-
term studies that can disprove this connection. It is all well and good to
claim that there is no connection, but this is by no means certain. Before
we instituted universal Hep B vaccination of all infants - most of whom are
not in the high-risk group - we should have been able to assure their parents
with some sort of confidence that their children will not be at greater risk
from the vaccine than from the disease. A court in Australia recently
awarded a 6 figure sum to a nursing sister who developed chronic arthritis
after Hep B vaccination. There are several cases pending of a similar nature
as well as cases of polyneuritis and chronic fatigue following the vaccine.
Ten years down the track, if evidence emerges that these problems are causally
linked to the Hep B vaccine, it will be too late for those children who
received it. We must take all care that we have not acted in haste (for the
best of all possible reasons - to protect our children) and that people who
are considering taking this vaccine - for themselves or for their families,
have access to the most up-to-date and accurate research.

[Okay, I am not planning on belaboring this by writing a long-winded response
but I must say that Meryl might have rethought the issue and quit after
writing the first two sentences. The point is that there are no data to
suggest a correlation between hepatitis B vaccine and multiple sclerosis.
One cannot go on and on about what might be and still live a productive life.
One might be concerned about blue ice and other things viral-infected falling
from airplanes, or that a sequela of the common cold is stupidity, or that
Bolivia plans to attack Inner Mongolia but that wouldn't be very functional,
would it? As for the Australian court that awarded a six-figure sum to a
nursing sister who developed chronic arthritis after Hep B vaccination, so
what? Sometimes there is no accounting for court decisions; they are not
made by physicians or virologists but by liberal arts majors. Either there
are data or there are no data. In this instance, there appear to be data to
show there is no correlation. Anecdotes don't cut it in science. Statements
beginning with "Our dog..." or "In my family we..." or "Her cousin's
friend..." are to be ignored. As will further discussion about this string.
