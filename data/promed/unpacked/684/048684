[Shandong Province is situated on the lower reaches of the Yellow River, on
China's eastern coast line. The province's territory consists of the
Shandong Peninsula and adjacent inland areas. Protruding into the
conjunction of the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea, the peninsula faces the
Liaodong Peninsula, of Liaoning Province, to the north across the sea.
Jiangsu Province is just to the south of Shandong, so it appears that the
outbreak is in a single area near the Yellow River along the East Coast of
China. It is good to know that the 2 outbreaks are at least in the same
area of the country.

A previous posting, however, Foot & mouth disease - China: susp
20050512.1297, referred to an outbreak in Sichuan province, located in the
western hinterlands of China. Couple these reports to the November 2004
unconfirmed report of FMD in Xinjiang, located in the extreme north west of
China, as well as to the Mongolian reports, and a very confusing picture
emerges for those of us outside China. It is unnervingly reminiscent of the
patchwork disease reporting at the beginning of the SARS outbreak. It is to
be hoped that the animal health officials in China have learned from the
painful recent experiences of their human health colleagues. More frequent
reporting using the OIE channels would be beneficial, and updates on this
outbreak and any others in the country would be helpful. For more
information on Chinese animal disease reporting, see the comments of Mod.AS
