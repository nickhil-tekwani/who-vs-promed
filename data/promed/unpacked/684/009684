The foot & mouth disease (FMD) virus may have passed into Britain's
wild deer population, making the Government's policy of mass slaughter
of farmyard livestock futile.
There have been several cases of vets clinically identifying the
disease in wild deer, some of which have died, presumably from it.
Veterinary experts say it is impossible to vaccinate or cull wild deer
and once infected they will act as a reservoir for the virus,
repeatedly re-infecting livestock. It will make it almost impossible
for Britain to rid itself of the virus, until it dies out naturally in
wild deer, which could take years.
Last week a roe deer was found dead at Kirk House Farm near Penrith,
which had already been confirmed as having FMD in livestock. Local vet
Matt Coulston identified lesions on all 4 feet and in its mouth. 'It
had signs consistent with foot and mouth disease,' he said. 'There
have been loads of people round here reporting dead deer and sick
deer. '
A Maff spokesman said government vets had tested 9deer for FMD and
none had been found positive: 'So far there have been no confirmed
cases of FMD in deer.' However, the Maff vets use the ELISA (Enzyme
Linked Immunosorbent Assay) test, which was developed on cattle and
sheep and is not thought to be so effective on deer.
In 1974 the government Animal Health Institute in Pirbright kept a
number of deer in proximity to sheep with FMD for 2 hours in a
controlled experiment. The scientists found all 6 native species of
deer contracted the disease, and several died.
In an outbreak of foot and mouth in California in 1924, the outbreak
spread rapidly to deer. Slaughtermen culled 22 000 deer in the
Stanislav National Park and found that, of those, 2279 were infected.

FMD: telling the difference between vaccinated and infected animals
["Mason said veterinarians needed a vaccine that acted faster and also
made it possible to pinpoint the difference between vaccinated animals
and animals infected with the virus. The vaccine now available takes
several days to take effect. Current [accepted] tests are unable to
distinguish between cattle, sheep and pigs which have been vaccinated
and those which have the disease." A quote from ProMED digest
v2001.n095.]
While working as the epidemiologist for the national veterinary
epidemiology unit in Bolivia (Jan 98 to Dec 2000) I regularly spend my
time investigating FMD outbreaks and surveying parts of the country
for evidence of viral activity (i.e. evidence of recent past
infection). In Bolivia there was sporadic vaccination against FMD
which makes telling the difference between vaccinated animals and
animals that had previously been infected critical to this work.
There are a number of diagnostic tests which can be used to
differentiate between infection and vaccination, most of which rely on
the detection of antibodies for non-structural proteins. Although
these tests do have the habit of showing up occasional false positives
(mainly in older animals with a history of regular vaccination) it is
possible to work around this problem by considering the epidemiology
of FMD.
FMD is not a disease of individual animals, rather herds of animals.
Similarly animals are vaccinated on a herd basis, not as individuals.
Hence, it is possible to tell whether herds of animals have been
infected since it makes no biological sense that only 1 animal in an
unvaccinated herd would be infected with FMD. In very extensive beef
properties in South America a prevalence of about 15% was normal and
in intensive dairy systems it could be over 80%.
Identifying an infected vaccinated animal is very difficult and
involves attempting virus isolation of probang samples from cattle
tonsils.
As to including a marker with the vaccine (something which will
differentiate infection from vaccination) I accidentally came across a
marker for vaccinated animals. Due to regulations and past history
trivalent vaccine for types A,O and C were used in Bolivia. However
virus type C had not been isolated from Bolivia or any of its
neighboring countries for more than 6 years.
Animals carrying antibodies to type C were invariably found to have
been vaccinated as were animals with antibodies to all 3 virus types.
Infected animals have type specific antibodies to the outbreak. Since
any FMD vaccination program would be under strict ministry of
agriculture control why would there not be a system of marking
vaccinated animals, perhaps with distinctive ear tags as with S19
brucellosis vaccination in many countries.
This would save some of the problems created by individual animals.
Alternatively ear punching could be used as a more permanent marker,
but again animals are vaccinated on a herd basis and not as
individuals and would presumably be under movement control so the
occasional loss of an ear tag would be irrelevant.
Should FMD virus remain in circulation in the wild deer population of
the UK, then vaccination will again become a very attractive option.
Indeed, had the vaccine been used when the epidemic was first
recognized to have been "out of control" at the beginning of March
[2001] it may have saved the slaughter of more than 2 million head of
livestock, a figure which could double before the end of the outbreak.
All this at what cost economically and socially to the people of the
UK?

Farmers are rebelling over the mass cull of livestock after it was
revealed in some farming communities more than 1 in 10 outbreaks of
foot & mouth disease were diagnosed wrongly.
Cases confirmed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
(Maff) to have been negative include the outbreak which led to the
cancellation of the Cheltenham Festival and another opposite the site
of the Royal Welsh Show, which was also abandoned.
The mass slaughter is also causing a n increasing health threat.
Nearly 200 000 rotting carcasses are waiting to be buried in Devon and
evidence emerged yesterday that water supplies were contaminated.
Philip Allen, of the National Farmers' Union (NFU) in Devon, said:
"People have had dead carcasses on their farms for 3 weeks."
Although herds on farms next to outbreaks are not meant to be culled
until the case is confirmed by laboratory tests, officials have
ordered dozens of culls on adjacent farms -- only to find later the
tests gave negative results.
There are fears that rivers and drinking water are being contaminated
by carcasses and thousands of gallons of disinfectant -- and may be at
risk for more than 2 decades. Mike Childs, campaigns director of
Friends of the Earth, said: "The Environment Agency says rendering and
incineration are the two best options for disposal of carcasses, but
Maff is dumping slaughtered livestock into pits which are not even
lined."

Pyres of animals slaughtered in the fight against FMD may not pose as
great a public health threat as feared, according to initial tests at
2 sites. Air samples taken at sites in Cumbria and Powys found levels
of toxic dioxins were relatively low. But concerns remain over
potential contamination with other pollutants from the burning and
burial of carcasses. (In mid-Wales, more than 1400 sheep are to be dug
up, after blood began leaching to the surface at their burial site
near Welshpool.)
The analysis of emissions at a site in Allerdale near Wigton in
Cumbria -- which did not begin until the second day of burning --
suggested the level of dioxins was "very low". Initial emissions test
results at another burning site, the Eppynt range
in Powys, seemed to support the Allerdale findings. Dyfed Powys Health
Authority said the risks of ill health from pollution at Eppynt were
confined to asthmatics living close to the pyres.
Dr Ian Lawes, who carried out the Allerdale emission test, said:
"Looking at the dioxin measurements we were quite reassured that they
are very low, typically something like 10 times lower than one would
expect in an urban environment."
Fires lit during the first 6 weeks of the crisis released 63 grams of
dioxins into the atmosphere - 18% of the UK's average annual
emissions, according to a the Department of the Environment.
The total number of outbreaks of the disease stands at 1499 with 13
more cases confirmed on Friday.
