I am of the opinion that this practice was stopped about 8 months ago when
they figured out that new variant CJD may be transmitted between people by
fitting the same pair of contact lenses on multiple people. If true, then
contact instruments for glaucoma testing should not be used either. I
believe I can find the posts on this subject if they are needed.

Many optometrists now use a pneumatic tonometer, which blows a puff of air
onto the cornea, calculating the intraocular pressure from the reflex.
There is no direct contact with the cornea. Would these instruments be
considered incapable of transmitting nv-CJD?

[I do not know if the pneumatic tonometer could present a risk of nv-CJD,
but I have no studies with any data. Is there anyone who has definite
information, or who is in a place of authority to let us know if these
instruments also fall under the ban? - Mod.TG
