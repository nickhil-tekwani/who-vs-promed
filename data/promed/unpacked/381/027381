[1] South Carolina: equine, human exposure

A horse in South Carolina tested positive for rabies in January [2016], becoming the 1st confirmed case in that county for 2016. The incident left 2 people who cared for the horse exposed to rabies, and authorities referred them to their health care providers for consultation.

Rabies is an American Association of Equine Practitioners' [AAEP] core vaccine, which means it's one that the association recommends all horses receive annually. The AAEP says core vaccines "protect from diseases that are endemic to a region, those with potential public health significance, required by law, virulent/highly infectious, and/or those posing a risk of severe disease."

Rabies is fatal to horses and poses significant risks to humans. After reporting on this South Carolina case, we asked readers on our Facebook page if they vaccinated their horse for rabies. Our readers responded with both wisdom and concern.

Several people commented that they do vaccinate their horse(s) for rabies: "I've always had my horses vaccinated against rabies," said a responder to the question. Another owner pointed out that there are many types of wildlife in her area that could contract and spread the zoonotic disease. "I always vaccinate for rabies," she said. "Bats and skunks abound in Kentucky. The example with possible barn cat exposure is entirely possible. Bat-to-cat-to-kid is a scary path."

Yet another reader said she vaccinates her horses regularly. "Because there are only recommendations and no laws for (rabies) vaccinations for horses, I get my horses done (regularly)," she said. Others mentioned that the cost of the vaccine was worth the investment in order to minimize the risk of their horse contracting the disease. "It's a small cost to protect my animal," the reader commented.

"My horses do not have problems with the rabies vaccines, so there is absolutely no reason not to give it," said a different reader. "Here in North Carolina, foxes, raccoons, skunks, and bats are all considered vectors for the disease. It's such cheap insurance, and it prevents a great deal of unwanted expense and stress in the event that there is a scare."

Another reader sought out information from her veterinarian about taking precautions against the disease. "Here's how my vet put it: If he examines a horse with neurologic signs and knows that horse has been properly immunized (for rabies), rabies can be ruled out," she said. "I try to do as few vaccinations as possible, but rabies is one I won't skip. We had a goofy raccoon in the pasture a few years ago -- we shot it, took it (very carefully) to the state vet lab, and it was rabies-positive."

A few people voiced their concerns about the rabies vaccines: "Every time my horse has had the rabies vaccine, she has had lower extremity swelling, even when we split the dose," said this horse owner. Another concerned reader shared her concerns about vaccinating her older horse, who has experienced a bad reaction to the vaccine before. "I worry that I would be putting him at risk by vaccinating him, due to his age and past reaction," she commented. "It's a tough decision, because it could go wrong whatever I do."

To address these concerns, The Horse contacted Joie Watson, DVM, PhD, Dipl ACVIM, chair of the Department of Medicine and Epidemiology at the University of California, Davis, School of Veterinary Medicine. "It is best to protect your horse from rabies using a currently approved vaccine at the recommended dose and interval," Watson said. "If your horse develops any kind of vaccine reaction, consult with your veterinarian about it so that a rational plan for future vaccination can be made. Some types of reactions are more serious than others. It is likely (though not guaranteed) that if a horse has been vaccinated multiple times in their adult life that they have a protective titer to rabies that may last far longer than one year."

[2] South Carolina: raccoon, human exposure

A Georgetown County [South Carolina, SC] resident is being treated by a doctor after touching a dead raccoon infected with rabies. The exposure occurred in Murrells Inlet, officials said.

The unidentified individual was potentially exposed to rabies while handling a dead raccoon with bare hands on 5 Feb 2016, according to the SC Department of Health and Environmental Control [DHEC]. The raccoon's body was tested for disease on 8 Feb 2016 and was confirmed to have rabies on 9 Feb 2016, officials said.

"It's important to use caution around any wild animal, dead or alive," said Sandra Craig, of DHEC's Bureau of Environmental Health Services. "Please keep this in mind if you find yourself in a situation where you have the potential to be exposed to the saliva or neural tissue (for example: brain or spinal cord) from any animal. Never handle a wild or stray animal with your bare hands."

The raccoon is the 1st animal from Georgetown County to test positive for rabies in 2016, officials said. There have been 12 confirmed cases of rabies statewide this year [2016]. There were a total of 130 confirmed cases of animal rabies in South Carolina in 2015, but none of the 2015 cases were from Georgetown County.

A woman was bitten by a cat that has tested positive for rabies, according to the Glynn County Health Department. The incident happened at the woman's home in the Highland Park area of Brunswick, where she had been feeding the feral cat along with several others. She's been advised to contact her doctor for follow-up. [Hopefully she has been receiving post exposure prophylaxis. - Mod.TG]

Glynn County health officials want to remind everyone to stay alert and keep an eye out for any animals acting out of the ordinary. Foxes, along with other animals that are native to coastal Georgia including raccoons and bats, can be carriers of rabies. Unvaccinated animals, whether pets or stray/feral, are susceptible to rabies. Rabies is a potentially deadly virus that's primarily spread by infected animals. [All mammals are susceptible to rabies virus. - Mod.TG]

Signs of rabies in animals include a change in behavior, biting, aggression, showing no fear of natural enemies (such as humans), foaming at the mouth, and paralysis.

If an animal ever bites you, seek medical care immediately and contact Glynn County Animal Control at 912-554-7500 and the Glynn County Health Department Environmental Health Division at 279-2940.

Monmouth County Health Department want to hear from people who may have gotten pit bull puppies from the Cliffwood section of Aberdeen in the past 3 weeks. County health officials are continuing their investigation into the confirmed case of rabies in a pit bull that died earlier this week in the owner's home. Officials removed 4 adult dogs and 1 puppy from the home.

Two of the adult dogs were lactating, which led health officials to believe they may have been nursing puppies recently, according to information from Monmouth County. That could have exposed the puppies to rabies from the pit bull that died.

[4] North Carolina: canine (fox), human exposure

A fox that attacked 2 people on [Wed 10 Feb 2016] tested positive for rabies. Tripp Bowling, of the Cleveland County Animal Control, confirmed the results on the fox that attacked 2 workers at the Children's Homes of Cleveland County, 425 Cherryville Rd. "(Animal control) will be in the community a lot this next week [week of 15 Feb 2016], informing people of what happened," Bowling said.

The fox that attacked the 2 workers, was "highly aggressive," said one of the workers said, following the incident. He continued, "It doesn't surprise me that (the fox) tested positive for rabies," I examined my leg several times (since the attack) and didn't find any broken skin."

The co-worker, who asked not to be named, had her pant leg torn during the animal attack, but the other worker stated that she didn't suffer any bites or scratches. The 2 will meet with the Cleveland County Health Department soon to discuss whether they'll need to receive rabies shots. The fox was caught and euthanized by animal control.

Animal control is asking people near the Cherryville Road area to be cautious and to look out for both wild and domestic animals that might be acting strange. "There most definitely could be other animals in the area that are rabid," Bowling said. "If you are seeing any animal exhibiting strange behavior, call animal control," Bowling said.

Domesticated animals that are up to date on their rabies vaccine have a very low chance of contracting rabies, Bowling added. But he cautions, if a pet does come into contact with a wild animal believed to be rabid, call animal control (704-481-9884) as a precaution.

Signs of rabies
---------------
Once rabies infection occurs, the virus grows in muscle tissue and may go undetected for several days or months. During this incubation (or latent) period, the animal appears healthy and shows no sign of infection. The early signs of rabies tend to be: chewing at the bite site; fever; loss of appetite; subtle changes in behavior, and occasionally a marked and sudden change in the tone of the bark.

The 2nd phase of infection usually lasts 2 to 4 days and not all rabid animals experience it. An infected dog may viciously attack any moving object, person or animal; a caged rabid dog will chew the wire, break their teeth and try to bite a hand moving in front of the cage. Rabid cats will attack suddenly, biting and scratching. Foxes will invade yards and attack dogs, cows, and porcupines. [This is called the furious form of rabies. The dumb form of rabies is where the animal is unusually docile, easy to handle and then suddenly bites. Some cats may be a good example of this, but there are certainly others. - Mod.TG]

The 3rd and final phase of infection usually lasts for 2 to 4 days. Initial signs include the appearance of choking; flopping of the lower jaw (in dogs); inability to swallow, leading to drooling and foaming of saliva (that is, "foaming at the mouth"); paralysis of jaw, throat, and chewing muscles.

We don't read very often about horses getting rabies, but they certainly do. A rabid horse can be suddenly very vicious and there are cases in the literature where people have had limbs torn off, or been stomped to death by rabid horses. Vaccination for horses is very important. Reactions are generally very few, but check with your veterinarian. There is no place in the continental USA free of rabies.

These articles with human exposure do not always mention the person receiving post exposure prophylaxis (PEP), but if there is a break in the skin, or a risk of saliva in a cut or eye, or contact with any neurological tissue then the PEP is recommended, in consultation with a physician or the health department. But these articles do not talk about reminding people to vaccinate all their animals or getting a rabies drive in the town to ensure that animals are vaccinated. - Mod.TG]
