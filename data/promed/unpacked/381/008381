A soldier has died here of suspected Nipah virus infection, a defense spokesman said here on Wednesday [30 May 2018].

The soldier, who hails from Kerala and was posted at the Eastern Command headquarters at Fort William, was admitted to the Command Hospital here on 20 May [2018] and passed away on 25 May [2018], the spokesman said.

He had been on a month's leave to Kerala before rejoining duty on 13 May [2018].

His body fluids have been sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune, which is the only agency in the country that can certify whether it was a case of Nipah virus or not. "Till such time the report from the NIV in Pune is received it, cannot be confirmed whether it was a case of Nipah virus or not," the spokesman said.

[This report underscores 2 important points: It is important to have as detailed a travel history as possible in order to identify the specific point of exposure to the virus, and 2nd; Laboratory confirmation is essential to be sure of the pathogen involved in the case.

Although not mentioned in the above report, surveillance of all contacts -- especially staff in the hospital and anyone involved in preparing the body for burial or cremation -- are important to detect any secondary transmission.

Nipah virus infections have occurred in West Bengal state previously, but there are no reports of them occurring currently, so Kerala state appears to be the most likely area of the soldier's exposure.
