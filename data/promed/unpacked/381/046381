Drug-resistant staph infection spreading
----------------------------------------
A man admitted Fri, 8 Apr 2005, to the Kent County Jail complained
about boils on his skin, and while lab tests aren't back, jail
officials suspect he has a staph infection that has plagued groups
ranging from inmates to athletes. The sometimes deadly infection is
known as MRSA, or methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_.
The organism is becoming more widespread -- especially in jails and
other places where people share close quarters. In Kent County,
medical staff since Feb 2005 have treated several MRSA cases at the
jail, said Sgt. Larry Quakkelaar, a jail shift supervisor.
The inmate admitted Friday is in isolation "just to be on the safe
side," Quakkelaar said. "He's isolated ... so if it is MRSA it
doesn't spread to other inmates," Quakkelaar said. "But we've had
other cases -- men and women -- in the last 2 months." None required
hospitalization.
Kent County jail inmates are "given pointers about what the infection
looks like and how it can be avoided, Quakkelaar said. "We're telling
staff to wear gloves to pat down inmates, and we're telling inmates,
don't share your washcloth, your towel, your toothbrush or your
shaver," Quakkelaar said. "And wash your hands frequently."
MRSA is a skin and soft tissue infection. It is also found in some
pneumonias, said Dr. Lilly Immergluck, an infectious disease
specialist at DeVos Children's Hospital in Grand Rapids. 2 inmates
at the Calhoun County Jail died 1 Mar 2005 of MRSA-related pneumonia.
Muskegon County has reported more than 40 cases since Oct 2004,
including 2 people who may have gotten the bacteria while using a
public hot tub or pool. At least 1 Muskegon County resident died
after contracting a similar drug-resistant staph infection, according
to local health officials. The elderly, terminally ill man died after
developing an infection.
It has also turned up on athletic teams, among Marine recruits, and
in hospitals and nursing homes. 5 players for the St. Louis Rams were
infected in 2003.
The MRSA infection has 2 epidemiological strains: 1 picked up in
hospitals and the other in the community. In hospitals, it is most
likely to strike those already in a weakened state. It is suspected
of causing 2 million infections and 88 000 deaths worldwide each
year, figures show.
The community-acquired infection is appearing in healthy people as
well as those with weakened immune systems, Immergluck said.
Doctors and hospitals aren't required to report single cases of MRSA,
so it's impossible to get accurate figures about prevalence, said
T.J. Bucholz, a spokesman for the Michigan Department of Community
Health. However, health officials do report outbreaks or clusters of
cases. "We know anecdotally, though, that we are hearing of more
cases now," Bucholz said.

[Community-associated (CA) MRSA has become a common and serious
problem. Although usually involving the skin as cutaneous abscesses
-- invasive, life-threatening infection can occur. The presence of
genetic virulence factors such as Panton-Valentine leukocidin in the
mec IV gene cassette may allow the organism to be more virulent than
the nosocomial (hospital-acquired) strains of MRSA.
In this week's New England Journal of Medicine (7 Apr 2005), there
are 2 full-length publications, 2 letters, and an editorial regarding
CA MRSA. One article reports on the epidemiology of the infection in
3 cities in the USA (Atlanta, Baltimore, and Atlanta) and found
incidence rates of 18.0 to 25.7 cases per 100 000 annually with a 23
percent hospitalization rate (1). The other reported on necrotizing
fasciitis/myositis caused by CA MRSA (2) and found 14 cases among the
843 CA MRSA infections. The letters reported on 4 cases of
pyomyositis from CA MRSA in Washington DC (3) and laboratory spread
of the organism to a microbiologist in France (4).
