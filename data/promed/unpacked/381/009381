Overview of the bluetongue situation in Europe with emphasis on
_Culicoides_ vectors. By R. Meiswinkel CIDC, Lelystad, The Netherlands
----------------------------------
INTRODUCTION
------------
Bluetongue (represented by serotype 8) appeared in northern Europe in
August 2006. Subsequently, it spread across 5 Member States (MSs),
and by December 2006 had affected an area of approximately 170 000
sq/km. Both cattle and sheep showed clinical signs, and at least 2
species of _Culicoides_ i.e. _C. obsoletus_ and _C. dewulfi_ were
shown to be involved in its transmission. All affected MSs initiated
national entomological surveillance programmes with the result that
_Culicoides_ are now monitored widely using mainly Onderstepoort-type
blacklight traps. The most significant findings made over the past
year are summarised and discussed with emphasis on The Netherlands,
where 20 farms are sampled weekly.

RESULTS
-------
_Culicoides_ activity during the winter months of 2006-7:

In Holland (and in Belgium), low numbers of _Culicoides_ (almost
exclusively of the Obsoletus Complex and excluding _C. dewulfi_) were
captured almost each week between January and March 2007; 99 percent
were freshly emerged nullipars, indicating that low-level breeding
had continued throughout the winter.

- How did BTV-8 overwinter between 2006 and 2007? Between January and
March 2007 (plus or minus 90 days) the absence of older parous,
potentially BTV-infected, previous-season adult midges in light trap
collections led to the (false!) hope that BTV would not survive the
winter. However, its ferocious recrudescence in 2007 invites many
questions, which are discussed.

- More _Culicoides_ in a cooler and wetter 2007: The average number
of vectors captured in Holland in 2007 is approximately 10-fold
greater than the number collected in 2006, despite it being cooler
and wetter and quite unlike last year [2006] (the hottest on record
since measurements began in 1706). This would indicate that warmer
winters and moderate, normal summers favor vector proliferation and
perhaps also allow viruses previously exotic to Europe to become endemic there.

- Marked changes in some vector _Culicoides_ abundances

The Obsoletus Complex is the most prevalent vector in Holland and
dominant on half the farms surveyed. However, in parts of southern
Holland, _C. dewulfi_ has this year [2007] superseded _C. obsoletus_.
If a similar reversal has occurred also elsewhere in Europe, it may
in part explain the intensity of the current outbreak.

- Diurnal biting activity in _Culicoides_: _C. dewulfi_ and _C.
obsoletus_ attack livestock in broad daylight while they are at
pasture, especially on overcast days. Aggravating the situation, they
also enter animal houses after dark. Therefore, the attack of
livestock by day and at night, both indoors and outdoors, complicates
our fight against BT. At this stage, vector control seems to hold
little promise for halting the spread of the disease.

CONCLUSIONS
-----------
In 2007, BT continued to spread and included a jump across the
English channel. The BT restriction zone now covers an area of almost
one million sq/km. There are no obvious geographical or topographic
boundaries that might halt the advance of BTV-8, making it likely
that it will continue in 2008 (and beyond) until it reaches the (as
yet unknown) limits of its range. This is daunting when it is
considered that vector _Culicoides_ (and susceptible ruminant hosts)
occur across the entire Holarctic Region, which includes the
Mediterranean Basin where _C. imicola_ lies in waiting, and North
America, where outbreaks of BTV and Epizootic Haemorrhagic Disease of
Deer virus (EHDV, another _Culicoides_-borne pathogen) are occurring
also. In this respect, it would seem that warmer winters will only
add to the conundrum in the future, promoting rather than suppressing
virus survival and vector longevity. Vaccination still seems to be
the best defense available to us, but have we waited too long?

[2] Immunity
Date: Sat 10 Nov 2007

Re: BLUETONGUE - EUROPE (56): BTV-8, VECTORS, VACCINATION, UPDATE
-----------------------------------------
[In response to item 5 "Bluetongue will be back - warning" and the
RFI in the commentary]:

Before any claims are made about lack of immunity and repeat
infection with the same serotype, BTV-8, proper investigation needs
be done. Unfortunately, it is rarely done in the case of BTV-8 in
northern Europe.

Professor Martin Beer was asked at the FMD and CSF meeting held in
Brussels on 17 Oct 2007 whether any of the cases of possible
re-infection with BTV-8 he had investigated had been confirmed, and
he said not. Specimens are infrequently taken during illness; a full
investigation of the differential diagnosis is usually not made, and
laboratories rarely store specimens for more than a year (except for
research), so response to BTV-8 in 2006 cannot be compared to 2007,
and the possibility of re-infection with illness cannot be confirmed
or excluded.

Are there any studies on abortion, stillbirth, birth defects and
chronic infection of the newborn? Are any studies being done on the
question of infertility, acute infertility primarily due to BTV-8
infection or due to secondary bacterial infection, and chronic
sterility in males and females? Are some breeds, ages or sexes more
susceptible to disease? Has infection with a larger inoculum than
that of one infected female midge bite had any bearing on the number
of sick animals in 2007 compared to 2006 as a percentage of the
animals infected? These and many other questions are unanswered.

It seems that farmers are supposed to pay all the expenses of
investigation and veterinary attendance after the diagnosis has been
made on one animal on their farm. In the face of such a disaster as
the intense BTV-8 epizootic has been this year [2007] in northern
Europe, how can they afford to?

Understanding infection, its epidemiology, clinical course and its
prevention normally requires a systematic investigation conducted
scientifically and funded as research or as an applied public health
project. Clearly, the entomology and the virus infection of the
arthropod need also to be and are being investigated by experts in
the field. However, there are no studies on our northern European
midges implicated in transmission of BTV-8 or on the effects of any
repellents, egg, larvae or midge poisons, such as avermactins or
sheep dips, organophsphate or cis-pyrethroid.

Farmers in Europe have spent a fortune on these without any assured
protective effect, and, judging from the intense infection in 2007, no benefit.

Though the EU has funded some basic epidemiology and entomology
investigations, which were reported upon in April 2007 by EFSA,
research into the clinical questions concerning BTV-8 infection of
the ruminants and vaccination of the immediate and practical kind --
inactivated vaccine -- have not been funded by the EU to my knowledge.

The number of ruminants infected in 2006 was quite low in the areas
where BTV-8 was documented so that most were still susceptible in
2007. In 2008, all the young, when they loose any maternal,
passively-derived immunity that protected them from infection in
2007, and similarly those born in 2008, will form a susceptible
population of a substantial proportion of the whole herd/flock to
allow amplification of BTV-8 in 2008 again, as in 2007. The exact
number of new susceptibles each year will depend on the number of
sheep (many of whom have twins) and cattle (most of whom have single
calves) so that about 50 percent of the ruminant population year on
year will be susceptible to BTV-8.

[Dr Watkins raises weighty, worthy issues. The introduction of a new
pathogen into a previously uninfected geo-ecological realm that
harbors entirely susceptible populations calls for immediate applied
as well as basic research. It provides a unique opportunity for the
study of the dynamics and interchange between pathogen, vector and
host, a rare, intriguing treasure for curious scientists and in wait
for its urgently needed deciphering. - Mod.AS]
