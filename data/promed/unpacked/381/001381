In a follow-up report on the yellow fever situation in Parana state, Brazil on Wednesday [23 Dec 2020], the Secretariat of Health of Parana released a biweekly yellow fever bulletin recording 3 dead monkeys (epizootics) confirmed in the municipalities of Cruz Machado, Honorio Serpa, and Palmas.

The epidemiological period beginning in July 2020 totals 87 notifications of epizootic diseases: 11 were confirmed as the deaths of monkeys infected by yellow fever [virus]; 32 were discarded; 35 have been identified as indeterminate, and 9 are under investigation.

During this period, Parana did not register cases of yellow fever in humans. Of the 10 registered notifications, 9 were discarded, and one is under investigation.

"Although we have no cases of yellow fever in humans, we are on alert for the circulation of the virus due to confirmed monkey deaths. These animals do not transmit the disease [directly]. That is why monkeys are considered sentinels and signalers of the presence of the virus," said the Secretary of Health of Parana, Beto Preto.

The Department of Health recommends vaccination against yellow fever to the [human] population. The vaccine is available throughout the public health network, and those who are between 9 months and 59 years old and have never taken a dose should be vaccinated.

The initial symptoms of yellow fever are sudden onset of fever lasting up to 7 days associated with headache, chills, nausea, vomiting, body pain, and abdominal pain. These symptoms can be confused with those of other diseases such as leptospirosis, flu, or dengue.

In about 10% of cases, yellow fever can progress rapidly to severe forms, with jaundice (yellowing of the skin), severe abdominal pain, bleeding, and kidney failure.

[The number of monkeys reported dead of yellow fever continues to increase from 3 on 27 Nov 2020. The dates on which the monkeys were found is not given except for the 3 most recent ones reported above, so it is not possible to know whether these deaths were sequential or occurred within the same period. The previous report of 8 dead monkeys indicated that they were found in 4 municipalities, indicating that the area where transmission of the virus was occurring was not confined to a single location, nor were the 3 recent deaths reported above each in a different municipality.

Finding monkeys dead of yellow fever (YF) is not surprising at this time of year. In Brazil, yellow fever has a seasonal pattern based on historical analyses of human cases and epizootics due to yellow fever in the past 20 years, with 2 different periods: higher transmission occurring between December and May (seasonal period) and lower or interrupted transmission occurring between June and November. Since the December-May period is beginning, one wonders whether a new period of transmission is underway. Efforts to reach 95% vaccination coverage in the state are prudent, given the evidence that active yellow fever virus transmission is occurring. - Mod.TY
