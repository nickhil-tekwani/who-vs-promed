[A] hantavirus infection is confirmed in a 5-year-old child resident of the Cambutal community in the Tonosí district

This information was confirmed by Germán Solís, Regional Health Director in Los Santos [province].

The child has been presenting symptoms of [a] hantavirus [infection] since this past [Sat 8 Jul 2017] and the medical tests confirmed the diagnosis.

Solís explained that the test was positive and it is confirmed that he has hantavirus fever.

With this case, there are now 5 cases of hantavirus fever with 2 hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome cases in Los Santos Province.

[Apparently, the child has hantavirus fever without hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). HPS is a serious disease and can develop quickly, with a case fatality rate of around 30 percent.

This report does not give any details about the circumstances that led to the infection nor specify the hantavirus involved in this case. As noted in comments on previous cases, Los Santos and adjoining provinces are endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Although no data on this or the previous cases in earlier years include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible, Choclo is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes HPS or hantavirus fever. No vaccine is available for Choclo virus.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents occur in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings.

A 61-year-old man died from [a] hantavirus infection in the Los Muermos community in the Los Lagos Region.

This was confirmed by the local Health SEREMI [ministerial administrative unit], Eugenia Schnake, indicating that the victim died last week [week of 2-8 Jul 2017] of respiratory problems.

Although the patient was treated in the Puerto Montt Base Hospital, his condition could not be reversed and the tests done by the laboratory of the Universidad Austral in Valdivia confirmed presence of the virus.

"In his home there were 2 storage areas, one of potatoes and the other of grain, unused items, and long-tailed rodent faeces that [can] cause the disease and the family was instructed to clean the storage area," Schnake explained.

The elderly lived in rural condition and carried out agricultural work.

[The specific situation under which this agricultural worker acquired his hantavirus infection is not stated. It could have been in his home, where there was an indication of the presence of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_) in storage areas. As an agricultural worker, he no doubt came into contact with areas inhabited by the rodent reservoir of the virus during his work. The numbers of cases of hantavirus infections in the Los Lagos region continues to increase this year [2017] and reported cases that ProMED-mail has posted now total 14. Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, including the Los Lagos region, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur there every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and if it does is only with very close physical contact, usually within the family. The most common source of the infection is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg.
