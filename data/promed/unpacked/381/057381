Ebola Response Roadmap: Situation Report 7 Nov 2014 [up to the end of 4 Nov 2014]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Highlights
----------
There have been 13 268 reported Ebola cases in 8 affected countries since the outbreak began, with 4960 reported deaths.
- Case incidence is declining in some districts in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, while steep rises persist in other districts.
- Intense transmission in the 3 most affected countries demands widespread rigorous control measures. Preparedness in unaffected neighbouring countries is also critical.
- There have been no new cases in Mali, Spain or the USA, but a high level of vigilance is essential in these countries.

Summary
-------
A total of 13 268 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) have been reported in 6 currently affected countries (Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Spain, and the United States of America) and 2 previously affected countries (Nigeria, Senegal) up to the end of 4 Nov 2014. There have been 4960 reported deaths....

An overview of the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where a separate, unrelated outbreak of EVD is occurring, is also provided (see Annex 2).

1. Countries With Widespread & Intense Transmission
---------------------------------------------------
A total of 13 241 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD and 4950 deaths have been reported up to the end of the 4 Nov [2014] by the Ministries of Health of Liberia and Sierra Leone, and 3 Nov [2014] by the Ministry of Health of Guinea (table 1). These numbers are subject to change due to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation and availability of laboratory results.

All districts in Liberia and Sierra Leone have reported at least one case of EVD since the start of the outbreak (figure 1). Of the 8 Guinean and Liberian districts that share a border with Cote d'Ivoire, all but one in Guinea have reported a confirmed or probable case of EVD. [See tables and figures at source URL.]

Health-care workers
-------------------
A total of 549 health-care workers (HCWs) are known to have been infected with EVD up to the end of 4 Nov [2014]: 88 in Guinea; 318 in Liberia; 11 in Nigeria; 128 in Sierra Leone; 1 in Spain; and 3 in the United States of America (2 were infected in the USA and one in Guinea). A total of 311 HCWs have died. WHO is undertaking extensive investigations to determine how each HCW became infected. Early indications are that a substantial proportion of infections have occurred outside the context of Ebola treatment and care. Infection prevention and control quality assurance checks are underway at Ebola treatment centres in the 3 intense-transmission countries. At the same time, exhaustive efforts are ongoing to ensure an ample supply of optimal personal protective equipment (PPE) to all Ebola treatment facilities, along with the provision of training and relevant guidelines to ensure that all HCWs are exposed to the minimum possible level of risk. WHO has moved more than 1 million sets of PPE to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and continues to work with ministries of health and other partners to procure and distribute PPE where it is most needed....

Mali
----
On 23 Oct [2014], Mali reported its 1st confirmed case of EVD (table 2). The patient was a 2-year-old girl who travelled [by bus] from Guinea with her grandmother [and siblings] to Mali. On 22 Oct [2014] the patient was admitted to Fousseyni Daou hospital in Kayes. She died on 24 Oct [2014]. Samples for laboratory confirmation were sent to SERAFO in Bamako and were positive for EVD. This has been confirmed by laboratory testing conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] in Atlanta [Georgia, USA]. To date, 108 contacts have been identified and are being followed up.... -- more

[2] WHO safe burials protocol
Date: Fri 7 Nov 2014
Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]
http://outbreaknewstoday.com/ebola-prevention-who-publishes-protocol-for-safe-burials-33547/


Ebola prevention: WHO publishes protocol for safe burials
-------------------------------------------------------------------
20 percent of new Ebola infections occur during burials of deceased Ebola patients. This high number and attempting to build trust and respect between burial teams, bereaved families and religious groups has prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to publish today, "How to conduct safe and dignified burial of a patient who has died from suspected or confirmed Ebola virus disease."

Ebola infections occur during burials when family and community members perform religious rites that require directly touching or washing the body, which still contains high levels of Ebola virus; and when family members distribute personal property of the loved one, which may be infected with the virus.

Developed by an interdisciplinary team at WHO, in partnership with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and faith-based organizations including World Council of Churches, Islamic Relief, Caritas Internationalis and World Vision, this updated protocol outlines step-by-step processes for safe and dignified burials. The protocol encourages inclusion of family and local clergy in the planning and preparation of the burial, as well as at the burial event itself, giving specific instructions for Muslim and Christian burials.

"We are becoming known for 'dead body management', but we do not 'manage' dead bodies. We safely, respectfully and in a dignified manner, accompany our deceased fellow human beings and help to prepare them, in accordance with their cultures, for their last resting places. It is in this spirit that our volunteers carry out their difficult work," says Elhadj As Sy, Secretary General, IFRC. "It is clear from Islamic juristic ruling that the necessity of religious washing of the body before burial of patients who die from Ebola is over-ruled," says Rehanah Sadiq, a Muslim chaplain with University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust [UK] who served as consultant to WHO on the protocol. "However, it is vital to help bereaved families grieve and find closure by ensuring that sacred rites, such as performing a dry ablution, shrouding the body, and praying over the deceased are represented in Muslim funerals. Providing safe alternatives for families to maintain deeply-cherished practices helps them be part of the decision-making process, which is critical particularly during a time when they may be feeling helpless."

"Giving the family an opportunity to view the body of the deceased, ensuring that the grave is appropriately labelled, and allowing religious leaders to offer prayers and family members the option to throw the 1st soil -- these are important incentives for encouraging families to continue to find strength in their faith, and to keep other family members safe from becoming infected," said Rev. Msgr. Robert J. Vitillo, Head of Delegation, Caritas Internationalis.

[3] Nigeria: expert analysis of Africa's response to Ebola
Date: Mon 3 Nov 2014

Nigerian virologist delivers scathing analysis of Africa's response to Ebola
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After Oyewale Tomori finished his talk on Ebola here at the International Meeting on Emerging Diseases and Surveillance, there was stunned silence. Tomori, the president of the Nigerian Academy of Science, used his plenary to deliver a scathing critique of how African countries have handled the threat of Ebola and how corruption is hampering efforts to improve health. Aid money often simply disappears, Tomori charged, "and we are left underdeveloped, totally and completely unprepared to tackle emerging pathogens."

Trained as a veterinarian, Tomori was the World Health Organization's (WHO's) regional virologist for the African region in 1995 during the Ebola outbreak in Kikwit in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). ScienceInsider sat down with him at the meeting in Vienna; questions and answers have been edited for brevity and clarity.

Q: You said in your talk that Ebola was "swimming in an ocean of national apathy, denial, and unpreparedness." What did you mean?

A: We were totally unprepared. After the 1st cases occurred in West Africa, it took almost 3 months for WHO to know. When the 1st patient came to Sierra Leone and died, his son brought him back to Guinea and as far as Sierra Leone was concerned, it was Guinea's problem. People abandoned their duty, they denied the problem, and when it became a big problem they became incapable of handling it.

This is not the 1st time Ebola has appeared in Africa. There have been more than 20 outbreaks since 1976. Not one of them has been declared a global problem. Of course, circumstances are different this time. But if we had been prepared, if we had learned from the past, we wouldn't be where we are today.

Q: You seem angry.

A: Yes, I am, because I know Africa has the capacity and the capability to solve most of her problems, but Africa will not enable her human resources to perform effectively and efficiently. African leaders have little or no respect for their experts and would rather act on advice from external sources. In the end, they become the experts on Africa's problems, not the Africans. This is why I am angry with Africa.

We have seen so many Ebola cases before, in the DRC, in Sudan, in Gabon.... Ebola is Africa's problem. We should have put something in place. I remember in 1995, when we had the Kikwit epidemic, at the end we sat down at a table and discussed what we should do. There was a laboratory in Kinshasa built by the French; it was almost completed, but then abandoned. We had raised almost USD 2 million at the time. And we said: "Why not take a bit of that money and complete this lab and maintain it? Then at least when we have issues like this we can do quick testing." But nothing happened. The carcass is still there. Each time I pass the place, I think: "What a waste."

Q: But your own country seems to have been prepared. Nigeria managed to contain the virus after it was carried to Lagos by a traveler in July [2014]. There were only 19 infections, and WHO called the containment of the virus "a spectacular success story."

A: We were not prepared, we were lucky. PS was already sick when he arrived, so he went straight to the hospital. And because our doctors were on strike, the public hospitals were not open, so he went to a private hospital. If PS had gone into a public hospital, we would have had a bigger problem. But within 2 to 3 days of PS coming in, we knew it was Ebola from laboratory tests done in 2 of our university laboratories, and then action was taken. I praise Nigeria for that. We had this emergency center from the polio network and we brought people in and traced almost 1000 contacts. This was not passive tracing; people went to contacts' homes on a daily basis.

Q: So why are African countries so badly prepared? Is it a question of money?

A: People say African countries are poor. But it's not poverty. It's misuse of what we have. As we are talking, with all the crises that are going on, the presidents of our countries are still traveling in the best of conditions. Some will come to New York in their private jets, although their national airlines collapsed years ago; in addition, they will bring along a long retinue of private, personal, and public assistants, all lodged in the best hotels. I am not saying the president should not be treated well, but these are issues we need to look at. Take my country: We do not have a national airline, but the number of private jets we have is more than all the airlines in Africa have together.

It's a matter of priorities. I do not believe there is an African country that cannot buy gloves for its staff. Personal protective equipment may be very costly, they may need assistance on that. But let us participate. As long as we are wringing hands waiting for the next glove to come, we will never be ready. There are certain things we can do now, with the resources we have.

Q: So African leaders should be held more accountable for what they spend money on?

A: GAVI [a public-private partnership that funds vaccines for low-income countries] just sanctioned Nigeria after a critical audit report. GAVI gave us money to do certain things, and we could not account for USD 2 or 3 million of it. GAVI insisted that Nigeria must pay back that money, and the government agreed. But our government should not just agree to pay back the money, the government should find out who misused the money, get the money back from those persons and not from public coffers. And those people should be brought before the courts to answer for the deaths of the children who did not receive the vaccines that the GAVI money would have provided.

Q: So how should African countries contribute to fighting the Ebola outbreak?

A: To give you one example, there are 600 Nigerian health care workers who want to go to Liberia. But the process of getting them there has been going on for months. If the African team, the African Union, the Economic Community of West African States, and the West African Health Organisation all get their acts together, there are more than enough people in Africa -- health care workers from Gabon, DR Congo, Uganda, Sudan -- who have experience with this.

But we must find the funds to provide insurance for all national and international health workers who are currently working or have volunteered to work in the Ebola-affected areas of Africa. Bear in mind, in Africa we do not have a welfare system. I am the welfare system for my family, my brothers, my uncle. So when I go to an Ebola region, I am thinking of the 23 other people that depend on me. If there is no insurance, I will stay home.

Q: There has been a lot of criticism of the WHO regional office in Africa.

A: I am angry at them, too. They should take the lead of Ebola control efforts -- not Geneva, not Washington, not New York. The [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC)] can help, [Doctors Without Borders (MSF)] can assist, but it is WHO's African region that should coordinate and take the lead. It's all meetings and reports. Nothing on the ground.

Q: As it happens, they are meeting in Benin this week; on the agenda is the election of a new regional director.

A: These elections are just horse-trading. If the person who wants to get elected requires the vote from Nigeria for example, because it is the ministers of health who do the voting, [he or she] might say: "OK, I will vote for you, but I need one directorship from my country." If he accepts that, he has to accept whomever I bring, regardless of how competent the person is. That is what has messed up Africa. The WHO regional office has never been able to solve Africa's problems because of this system of electing its leaders. You want to find the most competent person. Vote on that basis. Not because I visited you and I promised you this or that.

Q: Do you think this unprecedented outbreak will change things?

A: I wish I could say with confidence that in 10 years time we will not be where we are now with Ebola. But the countries have totally lost control of what is going on. If you go to Sierra Leone or Liberia today, there must be at least 10 international groups there. At the end of this epidemic, everybody will pack their bags and leave. The African countries will be left not really knowing what has happened to them. Like someone hit them smack in the face, totally disoriented. There will be millions of scandals about how money was misspent and so on. We will focus on those and move on; 10 years from now, people will have forgotten that there was Ebola and we will be back to where we started.

[4] Sierra Leone: Australia to staff UK Ebola hospital
Date: Wed 5 Nov 2014

http://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/australia-to-staff-ebola-hospital-in-sierra-leone-1.312243


Australia to staff Ebola hospital in Sierra Leone
-------------------------------------------------
Australia's prime minister said Wednesday [5 Nov 2014] that his government expects to staff a British-built Ebola hospital in Sierra Leone by the end of the month [November 2014] after reaching a deal with Britain on treating Australian health workers who might become infected with Ebola. For weeks, Australia has refused requests from the United States and Britain to send health teams to West Africa to fight Ebola, which has killed almost 5000 people, mostly in the worst-hit countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. But Prime Minister Tony Abbott said that while his government would not compel Australian health professionals to go Africa, it was now prepared to pay the way for doctors and nurses who volunteer to go there. Abbott said Australia changed its stance because Britain guaranteed it would treat any Australian health worker infected with Ebola.

"In the last few days, we have had assurances from the United Kingdom they would treat any Australian who is working in the Ebola-impacted parts of West Africa as though he or she were a citizen of the United Kingdom," Abbott told reporters. He said Australians would be among the 240 people required to operate the 100-bed British hospital being built in Sierra Leone, but that most of the staffers would be local.

Australia has contracted an Australian company, Aspen Medical, to staff the hospital with local and international staff. The new commitment increases Australia's contribution to fighting Ebola in Africa from AU 18 million (USD 16 million) to AU 42 million.

[5] Nigeria: Lagos bus park scare

Ebola scare in Lagos Motor Park
-------------------------------------
The prompt intervention of Chisco transport officials has saved a pregnant woman, who, after alighting from one of the company's buses at its terminal, Jibowu, Lagos, started vomiting blood through her mouth and nose. Scared by the development, other passengers were said to have taken to their heels as one of the passengers screamed that the pregnant woman was displaying Ebola symptoms. It took the timely intervention of Chisco officials who made use of their standby ambulance to rush her to hospital.

Juliet, a staff member from Chisco Transport, that "On 12 Oct 2014 at about 10.15 am, a passenger, who was pregnant, alighted from one of our buses that just arrived from Abuja. Immediately she alighted from the bus, she fell down and started vomiting through the nose and mouth. The Jibowu branch manager called on the medical section, which organised an ambulance and took her to 3 different hospitals, each of which rejected her. She was finally admitted at the Military Hospital, Yaba, Lagos. After several tests, they informed us that she was hypertensive, which led to convulsions. The hospital demanded that an initial deposit of N 36 000 [USD 210] should be paid before they could treat her. The bus company paid the said amount and directed our workers to take turns in taking care of her.

"This became necessary as we could not make contact with anyone who is related to her. We even discovered that she did not fill the next of kin column in the form we give our passengers. She later gave birth to a premature baby, and Chisco Transport paid another N 5000 [USD 29]." According to Juliet, the woman and her child were later brought to the Chisco Transport office as soon as she was discharged on 16 Oct 2014. "We later assisted [the woman] to locate her sister, who resides in the Ikorodu area of Lagos." Elated, [the woman] thanked the management and staff of Chisco Transport for assisting her in such a time of need. "I am okay and so is my little baby. It is only God that will reward them," she prayed.

[6] Africa: USD 28.5m crisis fund
Date: Sat 8 Nov 2014

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-29967124


Ebola outbreak: Africa sets up USD 28.5m crisis fund
-------------------------------------------------------------
Top African business leaders have established an emergency fund to help countries hit by the Ebola outbreak. A pledging meeting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, raised USD 28.5m to deploy at least 1000 health workers to Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Experts say that if the disease is to be speedily contained, it needs to be tackled in these 3 countries. Speaking at the end of the Addis Abada meeting, African Union chairman Dlamini Zuma said the resources mobilised would be part of a longer term programme to deal with such outbreaks in the future.

The chairman of telecommunications giant Econet Wireless, Strive Masiyiwa, said that several companies had pledged money to the emergency fund -- to be managed by the African Development Bank. The Ethiopia meeting took place as Liberia was reported by the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) on Friday [7 Nov 2014] to have seen a significant reduction in the number of new cases. It warned, however, that Ebola was still on the rise in Guinea and Sierra Leone.

Chris Stokes, the head of MSF's Ebola response, told the BBC that the decrease in the number of cases in Liberia presented an opportunity for health workers to step up their work. The World Health Organization says that at least one in 5 infections occur during the burials of Ebola victims -- it issued a guide this week to how best to conduct funerals. It is not clear why exactly the number of cases in Liberia has dipped -- but it has been running an awareness campaign to advertise best health practices and install hand washing stations. He said the disease could "flare up" again, pointing to Guinea, where the number of cases is rising again despite 2 significant lulls....

Of the West African countries hit by the 11-month outbreak, Liberia has seen the most deaths. But last weekend [1-2 Nocv 2014] its health ministry said 2/3rds of the 696 beds in the country's treatment centres were empty.... -- more
