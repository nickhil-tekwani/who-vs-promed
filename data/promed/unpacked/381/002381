Millions of kangaroos have died in NSW [New South Wales] in the past year [2017] as a result of a mysterious illness that has left experts baffled. Wildlife health researchers have found red and grey kangaroos on the Western Plains suffering "massive haemorrhaging", total or partial blindness, internal bleeding around the joints, stilted movement and inflammation.

"You would see a whole family sitting there but they were all dead," said Greg Curran, a veterinarian with 30 years' experience, who is a leading researcher on the issue. It's a disease; it's not a genetic problem. We haven't been able to find a bacterium; we haven't been able to find a virus. Parasites, they aren't part of it. Given the huge area and different kinds of country and feed, it's very unlikely to be a plant poisoning. You've ruled out all the known causes of diseases."

Steve McLeod, a NSW ­Department of Primary Industries senior research scientist who focuses on population, said there had been "significant declines" for red and grey kangaroos ­between the June-July surveys in 2016 and 2017. "There have been substantial drops right across the Western Plains," he said. "Except for the Griffith zone in the southeast."

The combined red and grey kangaroo population in NSW reached 17.4 million last year [2016], the highest since comprehensive records began in 1975 and more than double the population in 2010. This included 12.6 million red and grey kangaroos in western NSW, where the decline has been the most severe.

Grey kangaroos plummeted from a total population in western NSW's 8 zones of 6.33 million to 3.85 million. The number of red kangaroos dropped in 6 of the 8 zones, by 1.2 million to 5.13 million.

In the northern NSW region around Narrabri alone, analysts estimated there were 2.2 million kangaroos last year and found just 1.2 million this year. Kangaroo numbers are monitored through management zones. For the past 2 years, the animals in each zone have been counted by researchers in small, fixed-wing planes. They visually mark each one they see using video-game controllers.

"The drop is so great it can't simply be due to culling rates," Dr Curran said. "The number of animals that have been harvested for the meat market is low. It can't possibly be starvation or malnutrition."

In 2010 Dr Curran, at the request of -the then- NSW chief veterinarian Ian Roth, prepared a report on the issue with 12 recommendations to respond to a "mass macropod mortality epidemic". He recommended there be a rapid response, a squad of pathologists and experts and dedicated funding arrangements to manage future mass deaths.

"To have something like this where the best people have worked on it for decades and haven't gotten to the bottom of it ..." Dr Curran said. "Any disease that can claim 40 per cent is worth understanding." Dr Curran has been looking at whether rainfall has an effect, given there has been a correlation between relative rainfall and kangaroo numbers that is delayed by a couple of years. Starvation could be another factor, as is some form of migration out of NSW, but Dr Curran said this was unlikely.

It's not the 1st "mass mortality event" recorded in recent decades. In 1997 and 1998, more than a million red kangaroos died inexplicably after a season of good rain. In early 2010 kangaroo harvesters reported dead animals in northwest NSW and southwest Queensland. The results of blood tests from the kangaroos were "not consistent with any disease reported to date in macropods".

The suspected illness comes as other native Australian animals face serious health issues, with the number of Tasmanian devils dropping 90 per cent since 1996 due to facial tumour disease, and koalas increasingly suffering a strain of chlamydia.

[This episode requires an interdisciplinary effort to conduct a thorough outbreak investigation. Kangaroos can go thorough drought-induced catastrophic die-offs, but this does not seem to be the case here. It should be determined whether this die-off is caused by a single agent or whether it's multifactorial and associated with a population peak. According to the article, kangaroos reached the highest abundance number in 2016. Following high population densities, the condition of animals is poor and parasite/pathogen exposure is high, making animals more susceptible to usually tolerated diseases. - Mod.PMB
