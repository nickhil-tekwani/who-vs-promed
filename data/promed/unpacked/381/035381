China bans poultry from New South Wales
----------------------------------------------------
Hoping to avoid an outbreak of a disease that could threaten poultry farms,
China on Thursday banned imports of birds and poultry from an Australian
state [NSW.
Imports of all bird and poultry products are prohibited under the ban issued
by China's State Bureau of Exit-Entry Inspection and Quarantine, the
official Xinhua News Agency has reported. The bureau ordered local
quarantine inspectors to conduct "rigid and strict inspection on ships,
airplanes and trains entering China."
[It is a reflection of the Chinese regard for Australian controls that their
restriction was limited to NSW and did not include the whole of Australia,
as many countries might have done - Mod.MHJ
