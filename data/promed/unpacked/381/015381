Botswana has suspected outbreak of foot-and-mouth
-----------------------------------------------
South Africa has imposed an import ban on cloven-hoofed animals and
their products from Botswana after a suspected outbreak of
hoof-and-mouth disease there, the Department of Agriculture said on
Friday [28 Apr 2006].
"Laboratory confirmation of the disease outbreak has not been
received yet by the Botswana veterinary authorities," a statement said.
Beef is Botswana's 2nd largest export earner after mining, with much
of the production exported to South Africa and western Europe.
The suspected outbreak occurred about 45 km from the South African
border, near the area where Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe converge.
"Surveillance will be conducted by veterinary officials on farms
along the border with Botswana to ensure that South Africa is not
affected by this disease outbreak," the statement added.
The Limpopo River acts as a natural barrier between the 2 countries
and will make control easier, it added.
The highly-contagious disease does not harm humans, but it causes
fever and interferes with reproduction in cloven-hoofed animals, like
cattle, pigs, sheep, goats and deer.

[Botswana sent to the OIE an "Immediate notification report" on this
outbreak on 27 Apr 2006, see <http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_21.HTM#Sec11>.
The notification included the following description of the affected population:
"The affected population is within a communal farming area. Cattle
initially presented with lameness followed by salivation. Mouth and
foot lesions from erosions to ulcers of varying severity were noted.
Oral lesions were predominantly ulcers/erosions on the tongue and
dental pad and gums, and under-run dorsal tongue epithelia with
halitosis in severe cases. Foot lesions included interdigital ulcers
and coronary separation, especially the distal part of the hoof. One
case had teat lesions. Only cattle are showing clinical signs. The
estimated population at risk is about 90 000 cattle in the entire zone 7."
Since the results of the laboratory tests were pending at the time of
notification, this outbreak should be regarded as (highly) suspected.
Final results, particularly the serotype involved, will be appreciated.
The last outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in Botswana took
place in August/September 2005; it was caused by FMD virus serotype
SAT 2. The final OIE report was sent on 2 Nov 2005, see
<http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_46.HTM#Sec7>. - Mod.AS]
