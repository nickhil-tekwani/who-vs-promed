A comment
---------
With respect to the argument that there may be some link between HERVs
(Human Endogenous Retroviruses) and schizophrenia, I should think it would
be wise if the scientific community present this kind of information very
carefully and with great caution to the lay community. After all, President
Thabo Mbeki of South Africa expressed doubt and, in fact, made public
health policy as a result of, a theory offered that HIV was a HERV and was
only a "marker" of the disease.
This theory has been promulgated for years and has served to create some
potentially dangerous (not to mention lethal) decisions in both public
health policy and private treatment decisions among persons that are HIV+.
I am not saying that there is no validity to this finding regarding
schizophrenia, nor would I suggest that further study along these lines is
not warranted. I am simply suggesting that the HIV "lunatic fringe" might
use this kind of association to further confuse the public.

[While I have sympathy with this comment, I cannot support the contention
that such preliminary work should not be reported to the general public.
However, I agree that it is regrettable that the scientists involved made a
press statement ahead of publication; (i.e., the BBC report was on-line
before the PNAS version was available). I did not have the benefit of
seeing the published version before posting the report. If you access the
PNAS on-line report you will see that Dr. Yolken and his colleagues are
well aware of the pitfalls and discuss their findings with appropriate
reservations and caution. They make the point that the further
characterization of retroviral elements within the CNS of individuals with
schizophrenia may lead to improved methods for the diagnosis and management
of this disorder. - Mod.CP
