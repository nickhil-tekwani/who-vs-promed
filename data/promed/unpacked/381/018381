Ten people have been killed by cholera in a poor suburb in Zimbabwe's
capital Harare, health authorities said Sunday [23 Dec 2007].
The officials said the disease had broken out in Mabvuku suburb east
of Harare and that scores of other people had also been affected.
They said the 10 had died last week, and the cholera outbreak was
suspected to be caused by drinking water from unprotected sources.
The capital, like many other towns in Zimbabwe, suffers frequent
breakdowns of the water pumping system, forcing residents to fetch
water from streams and other unprotected sources. Health authorities
said they had moved into Mabvuku to treat those affected and to curb
the outbreak from spreading.

[Mabvuku <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mabvuku> is a high density
suburb some 17 km [10.5 miles] east of Harare, the capital city of
Zimbabwe. It is classified as a suburb or township of Harare, with
the Harare City Council constituting local government. It encompasses
in particular the townships that include Old Mabvuku and New Mabvuku,
and more generally Old Tafara, and New Tafara (the latter 2
constituting Tafara properly speaking).

Five cases of cholera were notified over the last 24 hours at the
provincial treatment center of the disease located in Kuito city,
central Bie province, ANGOP learned from a source at the hospital.
According to the source, the cases were notified in Cangoti and Camalaia wards.
The health unit, the source added, faces some difficulties, mainly
those related to medical-medicine means and hygiene. The provincial
center to combat cholera has 6 tents and the same number of nurses,
an amount which is considered insufficient to cater to patients
seeking treatment at the unit.

Four people have died of cholera in Western and Nyanza provinces.
Three of them are from Suba District, while the other is from Bunyala
District. They all died Wednesday [19 Dec 2007]. Nyanza provincial

"Two people died while being transported from the islands in Suba to
the district hospital located in Sindo in the mainland," he said. The
other one died at home. Dr Kioko said the disease was under control
on the island. Two cases of the disease were reported in the area 2
weeks ago. No one had died of the disease until Wednesday [19 Dec 2007].

The Mpumalanga health department is still baffled by the cause of the
outbreak of diarrhea in the Standerton area. The number of reported
cases has risen from 134 to 1727, and more than 60 people have been
hospitalized.
According to spokesman Mpho Gabashane, the cause of the recent
outbreak was not known, and water samples were taken to laboratories
for testing. Gabashane said most of the people affected were women.
The outbreak started in the week between 6 and 14 Dec 2007, and 48
people were hospitalized.
Previously, in October 2007, more than 650 people were treated for
diarrhea, and 6 children were monitored for high fever in Delmas, Mpumalanga.
