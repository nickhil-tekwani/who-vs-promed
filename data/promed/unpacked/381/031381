In May 2012, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health's Acute Communicable Disease Control Unit and Environmental Health, Food, and Milk Program investigated an outbreak of shigellosis associated with a private bridge club. This investigation documented the 1st known transmission of _Shigella sonnei_ with decreased susceptibility to azithromycin in the USA.

Cases were defined as an illness clinically compatible with shigellosis in a patient or _S. sonnei_ isolated from stool of a person with an epidemiologic link to the bridge club during 22-26 May 2012. Investigators attempted to interview all bridge club workers and members who had visited the bridge club during the week of 22 May 2012; they collected stool specimens from workers who handled food and from workers and members with diarrhea who had not already submitted a stool specimen for culture at a health facility. 39 cases were identified among club members with diarrhea and 4 among club workers; of the 4 workers, 2, including one who handled food, reported no symptoms. The average age of affected persons was 75.3 years (range: 54-98 years); 55 per cent were female. Among those with symptoms, the duration of illness averaged 5.9 days (range: 1-14 days). Common symptoms included diarrhea in 95 per cent of patients, abdominal cramps in 70 per cent, and fever in 56 per cent. 31 (72 per cent) persons sought medical care, and 10 (23 per cent) were hospitalized. No specific exposures implicated a source for the outbreak.

Among the 43 cases, 14 were culture-confirmed; 10 isolates underwent pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), yielding indistinguishable patterns. 4 isolates submitted to CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) displayed resistance to streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Unlike most isolates tested by NARMS, these isolates also showed elevated azithromycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of greater than 16 microg/mL (1) and harbored a plasmid-encoded macrolide resistance gene, mphA (2).

CDC's PulseNet identified 2 additional isolates indistinguishable from the outbreak PFGE pattern. One was from a man in Pennsylvania aged 23 years who had visited Los Angeles in April 2012, and the other from a man in Hawaii aged 53 years who visited Los Angeles during April and May 2012; both men were hospitalized with diarrhea. Neither case was epidemiologically linked to the bridge club or to each other.

Although sporadic cases of shigellosis caused by _Shigella_ strains with increased azithromycin MICs have occurred, this is the first outbreak documented in the USA and might indicate increasing circulation of such strains (1). Illnesses in this outbreak tended to be severe; however, the affected population was much older than the general USA population. Clinical management of such illnesses is likely to be complex; although azithromycin currently is recommended for treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant _Shigella_, options for alternative treatment among children with such infections primarily include parenteral antimicrobial medications (3,4).

Guidelines for azithromycin susceptibility testing and criteria for interpretation of MICs for _Shigella_ species have not been published. Clinicians are urged to report azithromycin treatment failure among shigellosis patients to public health authorities and to retain _Shigella_ isolates from such cases for further analysis.

[Most postings related to shigellosis on ProMED-mail are included in the cholera, diarrhea & dysentery updates. This report, however, documenting the 1st isolates of shigellae with macrolide resistance, stands on its own.

Shigella was discovered over 100 years ago by the Japanese microbiologist, Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named. There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. Shigella organisms can survive transit through the stomach since they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10 to 100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given its relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread. Humans are the only natural reservoir for disease.

Dysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux) is an inflammatory disorder of the colon, which results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces, with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing the diarrhea). - Mod.LL
