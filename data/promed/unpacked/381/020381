Authorities are urging householders in southern Thailand to eradicate
mosquito breeding grounds after more than 500 people in Trang
province contracted chikungunya [viral] disease.

Trang's health official Sathit Paisert said on Tuesday [19 May 2009]
that over 500 people suffered from chikungunya infection, and many of
them were from Muang and Yan Ta Khao districts.

He said the rainy season had allowed mosquitoes to breed more
actively, and people should try to eliminate mosquito breeding
grounds such as stagnant water around their homes. People should also
use mosquito nets when sleeping and apply mosquito repellents.

Chikungunya disease is a viral illness transmitted to humans by
infected mosquitoes. It is not life threatening, and its symptoms are
similar to dengue fever. Patients with chikungunya suffer severe and
persistent joint pain.
