Officials are urging the public to use safe practices when consuming home-canned foods after they say a man in Washington likely died from botulism. A man aged 55 to 65 died from what officials believe was the illness after health officials helped him dispose of home-canned food jars, Grays Harbor County Public Health said in a news release on Monday [25 Apr 2022].

Although the man's cause of death has not been confirmed yet, the release states that botulism is "a rare but serious illness" that is caused by a toxin made by certain bacteria, according to the CDC. The bacteria can "produce the toxin in food, wounds, and the intestines of infants."

"Botulism is odorless and cannot be seen or tasted; however, even a small taste of food containing the toxin can be deadly," the county news release states.

The bacteria that produce the botulinum toxin are found naturally in "many places," though they rarely makes people sick, the CDC says. But once the bacteria make spores under certain conditions, they can become lethal. Low oxygen, salt or sugar, certain temperatures and certain amounts of water can create the conditions for spores to produce the toxins, the CDC says. Improperly home-canned and fermented foods can provide these conditions. A person can become seriously sick or die if they consume foods with the toxin, the health agency says.

"The CDC stresses that home canning, while a fun and productive way to preserve everything from seafood to vegetables, can put people at risk of botulism if not done correctly," the agency said. "Using proper canning techniques, the right kind of equipment, and disposing of any canned foods that may not have been properly preserved is the best way to keep your home-canned goods safe."

The CDC says "everyone can reduce their chances of getting botulism," including by following this advice:
- Refrigerate homemade oils infused with with garlic or herbs, and throw away the unused oil after 4 days.
- Keep a baked potato wrapped in aluminum foil at temperatures above 140 deg F until serving it.
- Put pickled and canned foods in the refrigerator after opening.
- Follow safe home-canning instructions.

What are the symptoms of botulism?
- Difficulty swallowing
- Muscle weakness
- Double vision
- Drooping eyelids
- Blurry vision
- Slurred speech
- Difficulty breathing
- Difficulty moving the eyes

Foodborne botulism symptoms include vomiting, nausea, stomach pain and diarrhea, the CDC says. The illness begins about 18 to 36 hours after eating the contaminated food. The CDC warns that a person might not have all the symptoms at once. Anyone with these symptoms should see a doctor or go to the emergency room, the agency said.

[Most cases of foodborne botulism occur from home-prepared foods that are stored or canned improperly. No information is given with regard to how the clinical features and whether anti-botulinum antitoxin was given during the hospitalization. It is stated that the Public Health Department was involved in the disposal of the canned food, but the specifics of this and the timeline related to the illness were not stated, nor was the specific food or foods involved.

Foodborne botulism usually occurs when preformed toxin is absorbed through the intestinal tract, and when the botulinum toxin is exposed to the neuromuscular junction, the heavy chain of the botulinum neurotoxin binds to glycoprotein structures specifically found on cholinergic nerve terminals. This specific docking is the reason for BT (botulinum toxin) high selectivity for cholinergic synapses. After internalization, the light chain of the botulinum neurotoxin binds with high specificity to the SNARE protein complex. The target proteins vary among the BT serotypes. BT-A cleaves synaptosomal-associated proteins of 25kDa (SNAP-25). BT-B cleaves vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP), also known as synaptobrevin II.

An October 2013 article in PLoS Pathogens (1) found that several auxiliary proteins produced by the organism bound to botulinum toxin A and facilitated its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract via multivalent interactions with carbohydrate receptors on intestinal epithelial cells. Indeed, in mice it seemed possible to block the neuromuscular effects of botulinum toxin by blocking absorption using a non-metabolizable galactose analog called isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside and prolonged median survival time. The same group more recently, in June 2014, published that the same hemagglutinin complex of the progenitor toxin complex bound to E-cadherin, a cell adhesion molecule, as well as carbohydrate binding and facilitated paracellular absorption of the toxin complex (2). Abolishing either the E-cadherin or carbohydrate binding of the toxin complex drastically reduced oral toxicity.
