To reduce the size of these posts, there will be changes over the coming days. The tables will be reduced but are available at the source URLs and will be referred to in the summaries of daily changes for each country. Countries that have almost interrupted transmission and have been lifting restrictions (China, South Korea) and have lessons to learn as they attempt to prevent explosive 2nd waves will continue to be profiled. - Mod.MPP]

[According to the report above, in the past 24 hours, there have been 27 newly confirmed cases in China, 4 of which were imported and 23 acquired locally (22 in Beijing municipality, 1 in Hebei province). While there is no mention of association with the outbreak in Beijing, Hebei province has had locally acquired cases previously associated with the outbreak ongoing in Beijing. No new deaths were reported. Three new cases were reported in Hong Kong. A total of 1868 imported cases have been reported. There have been no new deaths reported for several weeks, which may change with the significant increase in newly reported cases.

There were 7 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals in the past 24 hours; 5 were imported. There were no cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The recent previous reports of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic were on 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13 Jun 2020, when 1 conversion was reported each time and 2 cases were reported on 14 and 18 Jun 2020. Prior to that, there were 2 cases on 1 Jun 2020, and a single case was reported on 18 May 2020 (COVID-19 update (194): China, S Korea, countries w/ high local trans, Italy phase 2 20200519.7352327).

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 67 cases with no new deaths, compared with 49 cases and 0 new deaths in the previous day (18 Jun 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 72 consecutive days. Today's (19 Jun 2020) breakdown of cases: 36 cases were locally transmitted and 31 were imported cases. Locally acquired cases were in Seoul (13), Gyeonggi (10), Daejeon (5), Incheon (4), Dae-gu (2), and Chungnam (2). Imported cases were in airport quarantine (18), Gyeonggi (7), Busan (2), Seoul (1), Incheon (1), Jeonbuk (1), and Gyeonbuk (1). Note that 8 provinces did not report any newly confirmed cases (down from 13 yesterday, 18 Jun 2020).

The English language page notice 385 has tables on PCR testing, regional case and death distributions, population-based incidence rates and epidemic curves for the country and by provinces with growth curves, available at https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030.

The impression (hasn't changed): Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. That said, it appears as though the proportion of locally acquired cases is decreasing on a daily basis, and outside of Seoul, Gyeonggi and Daejeon, the remaining provinces have not been impacted much by local transmission.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 238 011 cases, including 34 561 deaths, up by 251 cases and 47 deaths in the past 24 hours [note that while our calculations show a decrease of 148 cases since 18 Jun 2020, the ministry report mentions these discrepancies are due to regional recalculations]. The previous day's (18 Jun 2020) 24-hour change was +333 cases and 43 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are still in decline. As it has been, the major increase in cases was in Lombardy, reporting 157 newly confirmed cases, down from 216 the previous day.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak (see tables at http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4914_0_file.pdf and http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4914_1_file.pdf). Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (157) and was the only province reporting more than 50 new cases. Also, 17 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (5 provinces reported no new cases), with only 3 other provinces reporting 10 or more but fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases (Emilia-Romagna 27 cases, Piedmont 26 cases and Tuscany 10). Sicily had a major readjustment with a net decrease of 394 cases, and Abruzzo had a net decrease of 1 case.

The top 5 provinces by cumulative case count remain unchanged and are Lombardy, followed by Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Tuscany.

Italy is now 46 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 30 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up.

The spokeswoman of Iran's Health Ministry has confirmed 2615 new cases of infection with the novel coronavirus, raising the total number of cases to 200 262. In her press briefing on Friday [19 Jun 2020], Sima-Sadat Lari said 120 people have died of the virus in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of fatalities to 9392.

The spokeswoman said 159 192 patients have so far recovered from the disease and been discharged from hospital. A total of 2833 patients are also in severe conditions of the disease, she added. Lari noted that 1 370 718 COVID-19 tests have been taken across the country.

Khuzestan, Hormozgan, Kurdistan, Bushehr, West Azarbaijan, and south of Sistan and Baluchestan provinces are considered red zones, Lari added.

[As of 19 Jun 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 200 262, including 9392 deaths, an increase of 2615 cases and 120 deaths since 18 Jun 2020.

Iran has started relaxing restrictions on a more widespread basis in the country. This media report mentions 7 provinces declared in the "red zone"; other media reports have mentioned 10 or 11 zones, so it appears to be a variable response. As stated previously, with the increasing daily case reports having overtaken the prior peak in late March-early April 2020, it is clear that there is now a 2nd wave, most likely due to the lifting of restrictions too early. As observed during the course of this pandemic, the increase in cases preceded the increase in deaths by about 2-3 weeks. That being said, the major increase in cases was seen in Iran about 4-6 weeks after the lifting of restrictions. Iran is not alone in this observation/occurrence; it is being seen in other countries/provinces/states where restrictions were lifted while major active transmission was continuing. This is a tenacious virus, and the overwhelming majority of the world is still susceptible to it.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 2 297 190, including 121 407 deaths, an increase from 2 263 651 cases and 120 688 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 208 455 cases as of 13:00 EDT (GMT-4) on 19 Jun 2020, including 17 546 confirmed deaths and an additional 4690 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are Texas, Florida, California, Arizona, Tennessee, New York, North Carolina, and Georgia. This list includes states that are showing major increases in daily cases reported beginning with the lifting of restrictions around the end of May 2020. Noteworthy is the negative change recorded for Louisiana today (19 Jun 2020). According to the Louisiana Department of Health website (http://ldh.la.gov/Coronavirus/), there were 1666 duplicate records identified that were removed from the state's cumulative count today. Hence, adjusting for this, there were most likely 1547 newly confirmed cases reported in the 24-hour period 18-19 Jun 2020 in the state of Louisiana, placing Louisiana between Arizona and Tennessee in the above list of top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases.

In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, California, Illinois, Texas (surpassing Massachusetts in the past 24 hours), Massachusetts, Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Maryland. A total of 39 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) has data on cases, hospitalization, testing, and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance, and emergency room visits, definitely worth reviewing, a welcome series of analyses.
