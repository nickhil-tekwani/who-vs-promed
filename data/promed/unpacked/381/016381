Three people face treatment for rabies after being bitten by 2 cats
in Spotsylvania County that tested positive for the deadly disease
last month [April 2009].

One incident occurred off Hood Drive in the Four-Mile Fork area on 30
Apr 2009. The other incident happened on Duerson Road on 23 Apr 2009.
The county Health Department is handling both cases. County animal
control officers already have gone door to door to hand out
information on the disease.

Lisa Hill, environmental health supervisor, said that on 30 Apr 2009,
2 men were exposed to rabies when they attended to a cat they thought
was dead. She said one of the men was 85 years old, but she did not
know the age of the other person. On 23 Apr 2009, she said a
26-year-old woman was trying to help a cat hit by a car when she was
bitten on Duerson Road in the western part of the county.

Rabies is caused by a virus that attacks the nervous system. Rabies
is fatal to mammals and humans who are not treated "They are all
currently being treated," Hill said of the 3 people. "Both of these
cats come from an area where there have been cat colonies.
Spotsylvania Animal Control is trying to handle it through
education." Hill warned people not to touch or feed stray cats in
either of these areas. She said she is unaware of any other reported
cases. Rabies can be prevented in cats, dogs, ferrets and some
livestock with rabies vaccinations, she said.

[Spotsylvania county can be located to the southwest of
Fredericksburg in the map of the state of Virginia at:

Hopefully, Spotsylvania Animal Control will be able to locate the
feral cat colony believed to be associated with these rabies cases
and eliminate the risk of further exposure of the human and animal
population of the county to rabies virus infection. - Mod.CP]
