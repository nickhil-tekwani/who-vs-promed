A horse that died in Wayne County has tested positive for the rare and deadly mosquito-borne illness, eastern equine encephalitis [EEE].

The horse was located in the town of Rose based in the central portion of Wayne county, according to Diane Devlin, director of Public Health at the Wayne County Public Health Service Department.

The county's health department was notified of the death by the state Department of Health Arbovirus Laboratory. Devlin would not identify the owner of the horse.

Equine encephalitis is spread by mosquitos, which can infect humans, horses, birds and occasionally other livestock such as deer and dogs, according to the state Department of Health. Mosquitoes are infected by feeding on infected birds.

Approximately 5 to 10 cases of EEE are reported in the US annually, according to the state Health Department. [This statement must be referring to human cases, because there are many, many more cases in horses now. - Mod.TG]

"There is a vaccine for horses to prevent West Nile virus and eastern equine encephalitis and getting the horses vaccinated is the biggest defense there is," Devlin said.

Since 1971, 5 human cases have been reported in New York state, all of which were fatal. One case was reported each year from 2009 to 2011, according to the DOH. Despite there being a vaccine for horses, there is no human vaccine available to the public.

The illness is more likely to impact those [humans] ages 50 and older and those ages 15 and younger. Symptoms will begin to show 4 to 10 days after the bite from an infected mosquito and include sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills, and vomiting.

"The illness may then progress into disorientation, mild seizures, encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and coma," the DOH states. "Approximately a third of patients who develop EEE die, and many of those who survive have mild to severe brain damage."

A release from the Wayne County Pubic Health Service on Tuesday [9 Sep 2014] urged residents to take precautions to avoid mosquito bites that could potentially expose them to the illness. Prevention methods range from using proper insect repellent, limiting outdoor activities when mosquitos are most active between dusk and dawn, and reducing or eliminating standing water.

[Eliminating standing water, no matter how small, such as in catch pans of flower pots is a good start to reduce mosquito breeding grounds. Wearing long sleeves, using mosquito repellent -- especially repellent with DEET --, and avoiding outdoor activity around dusk and dawn are good tips for prevention of mosquito bites.

However, animal owners need to protect their pets. There are mosquito repellents especially for horses. Use them! There are also mosquito repellent barn sprays. Eliminate standing water around barns and change water sources daily. Be sure to vaccinate!!! It is the most effective way of protecting your pet. The vaccination should be given every 6 months at a minimum and preferably every 4 months in high risk areas (near a lake or near the coast).
