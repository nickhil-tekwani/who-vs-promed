Myanmar measles: Death toll reaches 68
--------------------------------------
Despite claims from Myanmar authorities that the deadly measles that swept through 9 villages in the mountainous Naga Self-Administered Zone of north-western Myanmar [Sagaing Region] was "under control", the number of deaths continues to increase -- with latest figures putting the confirmed deaths at 68.

Last week, one of Myanmar's state-run newspapers wrote that no more deaths from the viral disease had been reported in the region as the situation was finally under control. Naga representatives in Myanmar have refuted the report since.

According to a reliable source in Myanmar, the situation was "still worst" in the 2 villages of Kesan Salin and Kesan Karlan under Nanyun Township. He said that the death toll could be more even as some were yet to be confirmed.

While Myanmar authorities maintain that the 1st person to die of the disease was a 90-year-old man in Htankawnautkone village on 6 Jun 2016, Naga representatives contradict this claim. According to the chairman of Council of Naga Affairs [CNA] (Myanmar), Athong Makury, the deaths started from the month of May [2016].

[Measles is one of the many infections that have struck the area since early June, with hundreds affected by viral diseases including diarrhea, influenza, cough and eye problems.

Around 120 000 people live in Sagaing, where many Naga communities -- a conglomeration of several tribes inhabiting the northeastern part of India and northwestern Myanmar -- are impoverished and inaccessible by road.

Measles -- a highly infectious viral illness -- is uncommon in many societies due to the effectiveness of vaccinations.

Fan who attended concert in Chiba diagnosed with measles
--------------------------------------------------------
Hospital in Nishinomiya City [Hyogo Prefecture] has confirmed a man, 19, who attended a performance at Makuhari Messe has measles.

Japan's health ministry on Wednesday [24 Aug 2016] issued a warning after a fan who attended a concert featuring pop star Justin Bieber in Chiba City [Chiba Prefecture] has been diagnosed with measles, reports the Asahi Shimbun (24 Aug 2016).

The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare advised medical institutions in the 47 administrative divisions of Japan to be on alert for new measles cases after a 19-year-old man from Nishinomiya City, Hyogo Prefecture was diagnosed with the virus last week.

On 9 Aug [2016], the man, who contracted the virus while overseas, experienced a temperature higher than 39 degrees Celsius. His entire body then broke out into a rash.

Between 13-15 Aug [2016], the man visited Kanagawa and Chiba prefectures. On 14 Aug [2016], he attended the Justin Bieber concert, the 2nd of 2 nights for the "Purpose World Tour," at Makuhari Messe.

Five days after the performance, the man was diagnosed with measles at a hospital in Nishinomiya. Three members of the man's family have also been confirmed to have the virus.

Measles is a highly contagious viral infection of the respiratory system. It is spread by direct contact or airborne means, such as when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. Common symptoms include a fever, cough and a skin rash. For women who are pregnant, a miscarriage or premature birth are possible consequences.

The health ministry is asking medical institutions to be aware of potential measles cases and have preventative measures in place to prevent in-hospital infection should symptoms of the virus appear.
