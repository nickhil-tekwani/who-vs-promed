Air strikes struck a hospital in western Syria last week, killing 2 people, and there is evidence chemical weapons were used, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said on [Fri 31 Mar 2017].

A Syrian military source said this week allegations that government forces were using chemical weapons were "devoid of truth".

MSF said a bomb dropped from a helicopter hit the entrance of a hospital supported by the medical aid group in the rebel-held town of Latamneh in Hama province on [Sat 25 Mar 2017].

"Information collected by the hospital medical staff suggests that chemical weapons were used," it said in a statement. "Immediately after the impact, patients and staff reported suffering severe respiratory symptoms and burning of mucous membranes -- symptoms consistent with an attack using chemicals."

The health authority of opposition-held parts of Hama blamed the attack on Syrian government warplanes. The Syrian government denies attacking hospitals and says it only targets militants.

The medical charity said the strike knocked the hospital out of service for 3 days, after which the emergency room reopened. The attack killed an orthopedic surgeon, leaving nearly 120 000 people with only 2 such doctors, it added.

Jets have pounded rebel-held areas in rural Hama this week [week of 27 Mar 2017], as government forces fought to reverse the biggest assault by insurgent groups in months.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based war monitoring group, said the escalation in strikes injured at least 50 people in recent days.

Air strikes that hit the same town of Latamneh on [Thu 30 Mar 2017] also led several people to choke, the Observatory and a doctor had said, describing it as sign of a gas attack.

Abdallah Darwish, head of the health authority for rebel-held areas of Hama province, said earlier the strikes on [Thu 30 Mar 2017] caused "irritation, heavy foaming from the mouth, and constricting pupils" citing his medical staff on the ground.

A Syrian military source denied the accounts on [Thu 30 Mar 2017]. "The army has not, will not, and does not need to use these weapons," the source said.

A joint inquiry for the United Nations and the global chemical weapons watchdog has previously accused government forces of toxic gas attacks. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied using such weapons during the 6-year-old war.

The Syrian government forces have allegedly used chemical weapons such as chlorine and mustard gas on several occasions in their attacks on the opposition and rebel forces.

The report above reveals 2 new suspected attacks by the Syrian government forces in Latamneh town in Hama province. The reported signs and symptoms developed by the victims are suggestive of chlorine having been used in the attack. It may have been combined with sulfur mustard gas.

Immediate signs and symptoms of chlorine exposure
-------------------------------------------------
During or immediately after exposure to dangerous concentrations of chlorine, the following signs and symptoms may develop:
- blurred vision;
- burning pain, redness, and blisters on the skin if exposed to gas. Skin injuries similar to frostbite can occur if it is exposed to liquid chlorine;
- burning sensation in the nose, throat, and eyes;
- coughing;
- chest tightness;
- difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. These may appear immediately if high concentrations of chlorine gas are inhaled, or they may be delayed if low concentrations of chlorine gas are inhaled;
- fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) that may be delayed for a few hours;
- nausea and vomiting;
- watery eyes;
- wheezing

Long-term health effects
------------------------
Long-term complications may occur after breathing in high concentrations of chlorine. Complications are more likely to be seen in people who develop severe health problems such as fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) following the initial exposure.
