With almost 700 cases of measles reported around the country in less than 2
months, health authorities have heightened alert and declared outbreaks in
6 areas. The Department of Health on Monday [22 Feb 2010] said that measles
outbreaks had been declared in the following areas: Baseco Compound and
Moriones in Tondo, Manila [province]; Barangay Pulang Lupa in Las Pinas
City; Central Market in Dasmarinas, Cavite [province]; San Francisco town
in Quezon province; and Balabagan town in Lanao del Sur [province].

According to health secretary Esperanza Cabral, the country has already
recorded a total of 669 cases, 99 of which were reported in the 2nd week of
February [2010]. Cabral disclosed that this year [2010], the number of
measles cases recorded from 1 Jan to 13 Feb 2010 is 70 per cent higher than
the same period of the previous year. Health authorities said the increase
in the number of cases was due to rising temperatures as summer season
approaches. Moreover, many children in the 1 to 9 age range were not
vaccinated and are, therefore, prone to infection.

Cabral also cited the extended time that children are allowed to play
outdoors during the summer break. "More children play outside, and if there
is one child who has the disease, his or her playmates could get infected
also," the health chief said. Despite the rising figures, the Health
department said the measles outbreak in some parts of Metro Manila would
not [develop] into an epidemic.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has earlier warned the Philippines over
the possibility of reemergence of measles in the country. "The 2004
campaign brought the Philippines closer to measles elimination," Dr Howard
Sobel, WHO Philippines medical officer, said. "But the return of cases and
continued low-level transmission since December 2006 following 2-and-a-half
years of no prior account calls for continued focus on improving routine
and campaign vaccination coverage and local government financial commitment
to finish the job," Sobel added. Dr Shin Young-soo, WHO regional director
for Western Pacific, said the country "will need to completely and
repeatedly penetrate the pockets of under-immunized populations nationwide."

No measles cases were reported from June 2004 to December 2006, a historic
1st for the Philippines following the 2004 Ligtas Tigdas Campaign of the
Health Department [a special nationwide vaccination month for children who
were at high risk of getting measles]. The campaign, which aimed to
vaccinate 18 million children between 9 months and 8 years of age using a
door-to-door strategy nationwide, decreased measles cases in the country by
96 per cent and deaths from measles by 99 per cent.

The Philippines was the 1st country in the region to launch such an
initiative, which involves a system of feedback and strategic use of data.
The result included the identification and ultimately vaccination of missed
children in 41 per cent of total areas nationwide. Prior to the Tigdas
Ligtas campaign, an estimated 6000 Filipino children died from measles in
2003, with the majority coming from poor households who had least access to
public health.

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease which affects mostly children.
It is transmitted via droplets from the nose, mouth or throat of infected
persons. Initial symptoms, which usually appear 8 to 12 days after
infection, include high fever, runny nose, bloodshot eyes, and tiny white
spots on the inside of the mouth. Rashes also develop after several days.
According to WHO, there is no specific treatment for measles, and
prevention can be done through immunization. Most people recover within 2-3
weeks, but in some cases, measles can cause serious complications,
including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infection and
pneumonia.

[The Ligtas Tigdas 2004 was a door-to-door campaign, whereby vaccination
teams led by doctors, nurses and midwives visited homes and schools to
vaccinate children against measles during the month of February 2004.
During this period, 100 per cent of children in the age group 9 months to 7
years were vaccinated. (Other children were not considered to be at high
risk). Subsequently, no measles cases were reported from June 2004 to
December 2006, a historic 1st for the Philippines as a consequence of the
2004 Ligtas Tigdas Campaign of the Health Department. The success in
elimination of measles in the Philippines is illustrated dramatically in
graphs from the Gideon database reproduced in ProMED-mail post: "Measles -
Philippines (02): (WV), background 20090116.0186".

The recent reemergence of measles in some areas of the Philippines is
disappointing, and it is hoped that prompt action by the Ministry of Health
will contain the 6 outbreaks described in the Manila Times report.
