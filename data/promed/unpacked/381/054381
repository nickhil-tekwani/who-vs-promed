[1] Brazil - Tamiflu

The government withdrew all Tamiflu [oseltamivir phosphate] from the
market at the end of April 2009, to prevent self-medication by the
public, who until then could buy it over the counter without
prescription. Doctors needing it have to apply to the government
stock, which was then 6250 courses (10 tabs, 2/day/5 days) for adults
and the same number of the pediatric formulation [that's all].

The government also has a stock of materia prima of the drug
equivalent to 9 million courses, purchased in 2007 with an expiration
date of 2010. Once turned into individual doses, its validity drops to
3 weeks. It was then [end of April 2009] negotiating to buy an
additional 800 000 courses of the drug.

According to Roche, since 2006, 85 countries have purchased 220
million courses of Tamiflu.

Relenza (GSK) has not been available in Brazil, but is licensed for
importation if required.

[One wonders in how many countries Tamiflu is available without
prescription by a licensed health professional. If it is common, that
raises concerns about availability if demand exceeds supply in the
face of an outbreak, and about selection for Tamiflu-resistant strains
of A (H1N1) virus. - Mod.TY]

[2] USA - health care system

The swine flu outbreak has overwhelmed the U.S. health-care system, a
report said.

Communication between government agencies and doctors isn't well
coordinated and the World Health Organization's 6-step pandemic-alert
scale causes confusion, according to an analysis released today by
the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the Trust for America's Health
and the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Biosecurity. Worried
citizens flood emergency rooms while undocumented immigrants and the
uninsured delay getting medical care, the report said.

The H1N1 influenza virus has spread to more than 11 000 people in the
U.S. and caused 17 deaths, according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, in Atlanta. The World Health Organization
(WHO) is at phase 5 of its alert scale, meaning a pandemic is
imminent, even as the [virus] causes little more than a fever and
cough in most patients. Researchers say it is critical to address
vulnerabilities in the system before a crisis strikes.

"H1N1 is a real-world test of our initial emergency response
capabilities," said Jeff Levi, executive director of the Trust for
America's Health, a nonprofit organization in Washington, in an
e-mailed statement. "The country is significantly ahead of where we
were a few years ago. However, the outbreak also revealed serious
gaps in our nation's preparedness."

The report includes 10 recommendations for strengthening the
public-health infrastructure, including halting job cuts in state and
local health departments, providing care for uninsured Americans
during an emergency and helping health-care facilities prepare for a
surge in new patients.

The work was supported by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation, a Princeton, New Jersey-based, endowment fund.

[One would hope that the health care system would be spared budget
cuts that are going on across the USA and elsewhere in the face of
the economic downturn, and that dealing with the A (H1N1) outbreak is
a learning experience for health care systems in the USA and around
the world. - Mod.TY]
