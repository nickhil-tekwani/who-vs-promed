Honey can contain spores of _Clostridium botulinum_, an organism that produces a potent neurotoxin known to cause severe illness in infants. Infant botulism occurs when _C. botulinum_ spores in food, dust, or other materials are inhaled or ingested and germinate in the gut of infants who have not yet developed mature intestinal flora. For this reason, parents are advised not to feed honey (raw or otherwise) to children younger than 12 months old.

Infant botulism
Symptoms of botulism in infants under 12 months of age typically start with constipation and may include poor feeding and/or weak sucking, weakness, drooping eyelids, loss of head control and difficulty breathing. Severity can range from mild illness with gradual onset to paralysis, respiratory failure, and death. Prompt recognition of a suspect case, administration of antitoxin, and initiation of supportive care can halt progression of the disease.

The Texas Department of State Health Services will coordinate confirmatory testing at the DSHS laboratory. To obtain the antitoxin (Baby BIG) for treatment, physicians can contact the DSHS Emerging and Acute Infectious Disease Branch or the California Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program.

Recent trends
Cases are rare: between 2013 and 2017, Texas has averaged 7 to 8 cases of infant botulism annually. However, since August 2018, 4 patients have been treated for infant botulism and have a history of using a honey pacifier purchased in Mexico. Investigators noted that these honey pacifiers and other food-containing pacifiers are available for sale at retailers as well as online, and that parents may not be aware of their potential danger.

Recommendations
Infants (children less than 12 months of age) should not be given honey, or pacifiers containing honey or other food products, because of the risk of contracting infant botulism. Consumption of honey is widely recognized as a risk factor for infant botulism by healthcare and public health professionals.

Infant botulism is a serious illness that requires urgent medical attention. All suspect cases should be immediately reported to public health officials.

The FDA is reminding parents and caregivers not to give honey to infants or children younger than one year of age. This includes pacifiers filled with or dipped in honey. The FDA has received reports from the state of Texas that 4 infants have been hospitalized with botulism. All 4 infants had used pacifiers containing honey. These pacifiers were purchased in Mexico, but similar products also appear to be available in the USA through online retailers.

Botulism is a rare but serious illness caused by a toxin that attacks the body's nerves and causes difficulty breathing, muscle paralysis, and even death. This toxin is made by _Clostridium botulinum_ and sometimes _Clostridium butyricum_ and _Clostridium baratii_ bacteria.

Honey is a known source of _Clostridium botulinum_ spores, which can multiply in a baby's immature digestive system, and has previously been implicated in some cases of infant botulism. For this reason, the FDA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend not feeding honey to infants younger than 12 months.

The FDA is recommending parents and caregivers do not give pacifiers filled with or dipped in honey to their infants or young children. If you have previously purchased a pacifier filled with or dipped in honey, you should stop using it and discard it immediately.

The FDA recommends online retailers discontinue sales of honey filled pacifiers.

[Such products seem to be easily purchased online, for example: https://www.bonanza.com/listings/Honey-filled-pacifier-Soother-with-Clip-girl-/658177086?goog_pla=1&gpid=293946777986&keyword=&goog_pla=1&pos=1o1&ad_type=pla&gclid=CjwKCAiAuMTfBRAcEiwAV4SDkedm1YwHRn9wZPJFrsm90SI_aZtULdMcX7T9H-2sD1OlPpTrESSJUBoCpt4QAvD_BwE.

Initially, infant botulism was linked to feeding infants honey, but most cases are no longer linked to this vehicle. Spores of _Clostridium botulinum_ are ubiquitous in the environment, and many times a specific source is not discovered. It should be noted that even totally breast-fed infants can develop this entity.

The following is extracted from the CDC report on infant botulism in New York City (ProMED-mail. Infant botulism - USA (New York City) 20030117.0144):

"Intestinal botulism is the commonest form of human botulism in the USA; about 100 cases are reported among infants in the USA annually. Intestinal botulism occurs rarely in older children and adults [this form has been also referred to as adult colonization botulism. - Mod.LL]. Intestinal botulism results from colonization and bacterial production of botulinum toxin in the colon. Swallowing ambient _Clostridium botulinum_ spores, which exist worldwide in soil and dust, has been proposed as the principal route of exposure; honey is an avoidable source of some causative spores. A common source of exposure is not usually identified; apparent clusters are rare and often remain unexplained after investigations are complete. In a cluster of infant botulism cases identified previously in the mid-Atlantic region of the USA, no common source of exposure was identified.

"Botulism should be suspected in previously healthy infants aged less than 12-months-old who are constipated and who exhibit weakness in sucking, swallowing, or crying; hypotonia [decreased muscle tone]; and progressive bulbar and extremity muscle weakness. About half of patients require mechanical ventilation during hospitalization. Lumbar puncture and brain imaging generally yield normal results but can help differentiate among other causes of flaccid weakness. When infant botulism is suspected, local and state health departments should be notified promptly to arrange diagnostic stool testing."

Botulism immune globulin (BIG-IV) is indicated in infants with clinically diagnosed infant botulism, before diagnostic confirmation. The prompt use of this specific immunoglobulin leads to a significant decrease in both ICU and total hospital stay. Reviews regarding BIG - IV use and infant botulism can be found in the references below.
