MENINGOCOCCAL DISEASE, INVASIVE - UK, 1995
==========================================

Update on invasive meningococcal infections
Five clusters of meningococcal disease, four of them in schools, have been
reported to the PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC) since
the beginning of October 1995. There have been 18 reported cases and seven
deaths associated with these clusters, which have contributed to the
widespread seasonal increase in cases. The PHLS Meningococcal Reference
Unit (MRU) at Manchester Public Health Laboratory received isolates from 105
cases in October 1995, compared with 78 in October 1994. A total of 194
cases of invasive meningococcal disease were notified to the Office of
Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS) in weeks 40 to 45, compared with 145
in the same period of 1994.
MRU received isolates from 1005 cases in the first 10 months of 1995, a
total similar to totals in the first 10 months of 1990 to 1993 (range 1020
to 1199), but greater than the 936 isolates in the same period of 1994 (the
lowest total for several years). A total of 1448 cases have been notified
to OPCS in the first 45 weeks of 1995, compared with 1199 and 1211 cases in
the same period in 1993 and 1994, respectively. This year's increase in
notifications, which is greater than the increase in isolates received by
MRU, is unusual, and may reflect a change in notification practice. The
rise (about 20%) is mostly accounted for by an increase in notifications of
meningococcal septicaemia. Guidance on the control of meningococcal disease
is reviewed by the PHLS Meningococcal Infections Working Group. The latest
guidelines, with information on their scientific background, will be
published in the CDR Review on Friday 8 December 1995.
Invasive meningococcal disease and influenza
--------------------------------------------
Viral respiratory tract infections may predispose to meningococcal
disease (1). Several studies suggest that influenza virus infection
increases the risk of subsequent meningococcal infections (2-4). The
fraction of cases of meningococcal infection attributable to influenza
during the most recent major epidemic of influenza in the United Kingdom in
1989/90 was 21% (95% confidence interval 3%-36%) (2). About 60 of the 315
cases of meningococcal disease reported to MRU in the four weeks after this
epidemic (wks. 51/89 to 02/90) may have been caused by influenza. The risk of
meningococcal disease following a case of influenza during this epidemic
was, therefore, about one in 100 000, assuming that there were about five
million cases of influenza in England and Wales (2).
The signs and symptoms of influenza may be similar to those of early
meningococcal disease and it is important therefore that general
practitioners remember the possibility of meningococcal infection,
especially during outbreaks of influenza-like illness. An important
diagnostic sign is the presence of a haemorrhagic rash which does
not blanch under gentle pressure from a glass (5).
