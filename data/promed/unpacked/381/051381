The provincial government's campaign to have [the province of] Catanduanes
declared rabies-free by 2012 suffered a serious setback when a Virac
resident died of rabies 2 months after being bitten by a dog. The Animal
Bite Center based at the Eastern Bicol Medical Center identified the
fatality as a 23 year old man, single and a resident of Bigaa barangay
[district].

According to the senior nurse, the victim was brought to the provincial
hospital in the morning of 10 Jan 2010 after beginning to show symptoms of
rabies on the afternoon of 9 Jan 2010. Despite his condition, he managed to
tell hospital personnel that he had been bitten by a dog sometime in the
last week of November [2009]. He said he was trying to shoo away the dog,
which was chasing their chickens, when the animal jumped on him and bit him
on the left cheek before running away towards the nearby mountains. He
added that he did not seek medical attention at the bite center or consult
any physician regarding the wound.

The patient died the following morning. Unknown to him, the dog did not
escape to the mountains but was instead caught and slaughtered by
residents, who cooked the meat as "pulutan" [a cooked meal] during a
drinking session that same day. Upon learning of Panti's death, 12 people
presented themselves at the EBMC Animal Bite Center for anti-rabies
injections. [Presumably because they may have had contact with saliva of
the rabid dog or been injured. Rabies cannot be contracted by consumption
of cooked meat from a rabid animal. - Mod.CP]

The fatality, the 1st in 2010, came after Catanduanes registered zero
deaths from rabies in 2009, although there were 4 confirmed animal rabies
cases. Under the current national anti-rabies campaign, a province will be
declared rabies-free by 2012 if it registers no fatalities from rabies
beginning in 2010.

The development also came as the Provincial Rabies Coordinating Committee
began meeting with local government units to encourage them to achieve a
100 percent vaccination rate among dogs in their localities in the 1st 3
months of the year. As of 10 Dec 2009, the committee reported that only
8384 (52 per cent) of the estimated 16 275 dogs in the province had been
vaccinated, while only 6240 dog leashes, collars and tags have been
distributed throughout the 11 towns. Of the 11 towns, only Panganiban (76
per cent), Bagamanoc (74 per cent) and Gigmoto (72 per cent) registered
accomplishments higher than 70 per cent, while Virac and San Miguel scored
25 per cent and 15 per cent, respectively. Lack of political will,
compounded by the unwillingness of dog owners, particularly in rural areas,
and lack of funds for the hiring of vaccinators, have been blamed for the
campaign's failure to achieve 100 per cent vaccination in 2009.

The Department of Health says that rabies, which is acute encephalitis with
a fatal outcome and no effective cure, has been responsible for 250 to 290
deaths each year, nearly 60 per cent of them children below 15 years old.
For the past years, human rabies cases in the Philippines have been
consistently among the top 5 in the world.

Based on the 1:10 ratio, there are about 8 million dogs nationwide. Data
from the Department of Health National Rabies Prevention and Control
Program show that 98 per cent of human rabies cases are attributed to dog
bites, 1.3 for cats and less than one per cent for other animals. Among the
dog bites, almost 90 per cent of the victims are bitten by their pet dogs,
and the rest are stray dogs. The majority of these cases happen during the
summer months, because school-age children are on vacation and usually play
outside the house.

[This is a particularly lucid account of the problems encountered even in
well organised efforts to eradicate canine rabies from an island community.
Nonetheless, the situation in the Philippines island of Catanduanes
contrasts favourably with the current situation in the Indonesian island of
Bali (see numerous recent reports in ProMED-mail). It is tragic, however,
that the most vulnerable group in Catanduanes has been children under the
age of 15 years.

Catanduanes is one of the the 7107 islands that comprise the Philippines. A
