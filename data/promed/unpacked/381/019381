50 per cent of Fiji's eggplant [aubergine] export has been rejected due to skin lesions on the [fruits]. Last year [2014], Fiji exported 500 tonnes of eggplant to New Zealand alone.

The eggplant disease has increased over the last 3 months. With a long list of possible causes, a series of research trials has been designed. The Ministry of Agriculture has formed a research task force to look into the possible causes and provide the industry with some mitigating strategies. This taskforce comprises personnel from the Agriculture Ministry's research and extension division, Biosecurity Authority of Fiji, Nature's Way Cooperative, Secretariat of the Pacific Community and exporters' representatives.

The head of the cooperative, a Nadi-based company that [supplies quarantine treatments for] export produce, said exporters had been seriously affected by the disorder. It also affects supplying farmers.

[A range of pathogens, including fungi, bacteria and viruses, are known to affect eggplant/aubergine (_Solanum melongena_) and other solanaceous crops. Several of them are known to occur in the region, but the symptoms described above are not sufficient for diagnosis.

Since reliable diagnosis of the cause and/or pathogen(s) associated with the problem is essential before any management strategies can be designed, a systematic approach, as described above, is the best way to protect national primary producers in the long term.
