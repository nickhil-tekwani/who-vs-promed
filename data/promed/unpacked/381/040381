The head of Epidemiology of the Departmental Health Services, Arturo Quinones, announced on Monday [15 Apr 2013] that the death of an adolescent girl in the tropical [area] of Cochabamba [department] suspected of [a] hantavirus [infection] mobilized specialists of this public institution in order to avoid new victims.

"This past week we have had 3 suspected [cases], of whom one died, [the] 17-year-old [girl], and we still have not received the laboratory results to confirm (the cause [of death])," he explained to the reporters.

Quinones added that the other 2 people who presented with symptoms of the disease are 24 and 40 years old and live in the same area where cases of hantavirus [infection] have occurred in previous years.

He explained that as a preventive measure he sent a commission of experts to determine the epidemiological situation in the area and give recommendations to residents there.

Hantaviruses are a group of various RNA viruses transmitted by infected rodents that urinate or defecate on food materials and in humans produce viral hemorrhagic fever, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, or severe pulmonary syndrome.

[In the Western hemisphere, the clinical disease caused by hantavirus infections is hantavirus pulmonary (or cardiopulmonary) syndrome (HPS), with a relatively high case fatality rate, especially when patients are late in receiving medical attention. Earlier this year (2013) there were 3 hantavirus pulmonary syndrome cases in the Amazon Basin region of La Paz department. The specific hantavirus involved in these 3 and the 3 previous cases, or those in 2012, are not given.

In the lowland Amazon Basin of Bolivia, the possible hantavirus that might be involved in these hantavirus pulmonary syndrome cases is Laguna Negra virus and its rodent hosts, _Calomys laucha_ (http://www.faunaparaguay.com/images/Calomys%20laucha%20enciso%2031aug2011.jpg) and _C. callosus_ (https://eee.uci.edu/clients/bjbecker/PlaguesandPeople/Calomyscallosusb.jpg). Other hantaviruses (and their rodent hosts) that have been found in lowland Bolivia and can cause HPS include
- Bermejo (_Oligoryzomys chacoensis_ http://www.faunaparaguay.com/images/Oligoryzomys%20chacoensis%20enciso%2015jul11.jpg), and
- Oran (_O. longicaudatus_ http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/imgs/512x768/0000_0000/0711/1203.jpeg).
