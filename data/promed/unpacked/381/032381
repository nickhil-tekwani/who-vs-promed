P4 lab inaugurated - France (Lyon) 990309233405

The Irish Times post on the Jean Merieux P4 lab [in Lyon, France states it
is one of only four in the world.
I have seen a number of listings of supposedly P4 labs,
usually in the media, including a veterinary facility in Spain. I assume
Atlanta, Fort Detrick, Porton Down, and Zagorsk had or have such labs, as
probably Moscow and Novosibirsk. Have any of these been closed down?
Did Yale have one before the incident in the 1970s? I have seen rabies
listed as a P4 virus; if so, what of specialty labs such as the NY State
Rabies Laboratory at Albany?
Could the moderator or a correspondent provide a current list of P4 labs?

[Perhaps we can collect this information from our subscribers. HereÂ´s what
I think I know (numbers refer to facilities; some contain more than one P4
lab suite):
Canada: 2 (one inactive)
UK: 2 (CAMR & MoD, both at Porton Down)
USA: 4 (CDC Atlanta; USAMRIID, Fort Detrick; Emory U., Atlanta (new), Plum
Island)
[The NYS Rabies lab is P3; where did you see rabies listed as a P4 agent?
USSR: 2? (Vektor, Koltsovo, Novosibirsk, Siberia; Moscow?)
Belgium: 0 (Antwerp closed)
South Africa: 1 (National Institute of Virology)
