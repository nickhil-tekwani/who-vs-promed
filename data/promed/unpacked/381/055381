U.S. Zookeepers Wary of Herpes Virus Attacking Asian Elephants
--------------------------------------------------------------
Zookeepers in St. Louis, MO, feared the worst when they noticed that
Jade, a 2-year-old elephant calf, was acting sluggish this month
[February 2009]. The calf was limping slightly, her appetite was
down, and the keepers, wary of a deadly herpesvirus prevalent in the
country's Asian elephant population, sent a blood sample to a
laboratory for analysis.

"That's pretty much the 1st thing we do when we see something amiss
with our Asian elephant calves," said Martha Fischer, curator of
mammals at the St. Louis Zoo. "It's such a mysterious disease, and it
has presented itself in so many different ways -- anything could be a
symptom."

Veterinarians began monitoring the 1100-pound calf around the clock.
They fed her fluids intravenously and started her on antiviral drugs.
Still, her condition worsened. Her head became swollen at the jaw and
forehead, and her tongue, normally bubble-gum pink, became pale and
speckled by an intricate pattern of red bruises. Results from the
National Elephant Herpesvirus Laboratory at the Smithsonian National
Zoo in Washington soon revealed that Jade was fighting a previously
unknown strain of the virus.

Researchers say the disease, elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus
[EEHV], has killed 1 of 5 Asian elephant calves born in North
American zoos since 2000. It accounts for more than half of all
deaths of juvenile elephants in North America, and researchers,
working with available tissue samples, estimate that it has killed
some 24 elephants since 1983.

Still, the researchers know little about the disease, including how
it is transmitted. Nor can they say whether it will remain dormant
after its initial assault only to re-emerge, like some herpes viruses
in humans. The disease cannot be detected in the blood unless signs
are evident, researchers say, and they are unsure what percentage of
elephants carry any of the 5 known strains.

"We're still trying to figure out the epidemiology," said Laura
Richman, the research associate who heads the Smithsonian laboratory
that analyzed Jade's blood sample. "We're still trying to figure out
how it's transmitted, and why certain elephants die and others
don't." Ms. Richman, who 1st identified the virus in 1995, says that
many mature elephants may carry a latent form of the disease but that
calves may be more susceptible because their immune systems are not
fully developed.

The virus exists in captive and wild elephant populations, Ms.
Richman said, and often affects only one elephant at a time. "There
aren't big outbreaks where you'll see whole herds of elephants coming
down with the virus," she said. "It's probably just a matter of which
elephants are shedding at what time, but we don't know -- whether it
is a secretion of saliva or something else -- we just don't know how
it's transmitted."

The virus infects the cells that line the body's blood vessels,
causing hemorrhaging. The subsequent vascular collapse often kills
its victims within weeks or even days. Antiviral drugs have been
successful in 6 North American cases, but about twice as many calves
have died from the virus even after receiving the drugs, leaving
researchers uncertain about how best to fight it.

"We're not sure that the drugs we're using are effective against
EEHV," Ms. Fischer said. "We're not sure what the dose should be.
It's a little bit of a shot in the dark."

The St. Louis case is shaping up as a trove of information. Jade's
signs have largely subsided, Ms. Fischer said, and she appears to be
recovering. Blood tests on the zoo's 7 other elephants revealed that
another calf, Maliha, carried a very low level of the virus, and
researchers say they believe the antiviral drugs she is receiving
have stopped its progression.

"I'm not about to say Jade's out of the woods, but we're really
pleased with her condition," Ms. Fischer said. "We're hoping to be
able to go back and determine whether the drugs were effective."

Asian elephants have been listed as an endangered species by the
International Union for Conservation of Nature since the mid-1980s.
The organization further reports that a combination of ivory poaching
and a loss of natural habitat have caused wild elephant numbers to
plunge by about 50 percent in the past 75 years to 40 000 to 50 000.
Although experts say the elephant herpesvirus has evolved over
millions of years, the dwindling population puts the species at
greater risk from the disease.

There are a lot of unanswered questions about the disease, said Mike
Keele, deputy director of the Oregon Zoo: "What's the prevalence of
it in the wild population, and how does it affect survivability?" Mr.
Keele said that his zoo's elephant population had not suffered a
herpes outbreak, but that zookeepers were training a 6-month-old male
calf to take medications and allow daily inspections of his tongue to
guard against an attack. "There's no reason why it couldn't happen
here," Mr. Keele said. "We don't know how long this virus has been in
our population, but no one ever thought to look for it."
