A study from China has provided evidence that bats may be the natural
reservoir for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(SARS-CoV) [1]. Bats are already well recognized as a potential
source of human rabies cases caused by bat lyssavirus, and of
emerging viral infections such as Nipah virus [2]. Bats may also be a
host for Ebola virus [3]. Direct interactions between bats and humans
are rare, although there are exceptions, such as the trained bat
handlers in many countries. However, changing ecology or other
circumstances can bring endemic bat infections to humans by means of
an intermediary species [4] and this may have occurred in the case of
SARS.
Since the emergence of SARS-CoV in 2003, researchers have been
seeking the original source of the infection. SARS-CoV was discovered
in palm civets in Chinese markets, leading to culling of these
cat-like animals. Further studies have shown that civets infected
with SARS-CoV show symptoms of disease, and the virus has not been
found in other civet populations, suggesting that civets are not the
natural reservoir [5,6].
Researchers in China have recently identified viruses similar to
human SARS-CoV in 3 species of horseshoe bat. In 4 locations in
China, they collected blood, fecal and throat samples from 408 bats
representing 9 species. 3 species of horseshoe bat (genus
_Rhinolophus_) showed a high prevalence (28-71 percent) of antibodies
to SARS-CoV, consistent with their being a wildlife reservoir for
this virus. The viruses found in these bats were further
characterized using PCR, and putative evolutionary relationships to
other coronaviruses were determined, based on conserved and variable
viral proteins. These analyses suggested that the viruses were
closely related to human SARS-CoV, with 92 percent sequence identity.
Bats may pass disease on to humans directly through biting or
salivary contact (European bat lyssavirus [7]), or through human
ingestion of food chewed by the bat (Nipah virus [4]). Another
probably more common route is transmission through another species,
which is in contact with both bats and humans. Changing
circumstances, such as bringing livestock into areas populated by
bats, or selling bats or bat products in markets where other animals
are present, may cause a 'spillover' of infection into a new species
[4,8]. In the case of SARS this may have been the palm civet [6],
sold in markets alongside bats; in the case of Nipah virus, it is
domesticated livestock [2]. Transmission of Nipah and Hendra viruses
may follow ingestion of insects or fruit partly digested by bats [4],
and a similar mechanism is suggested to account for the presence of
Ebola virus in primates and duikers following fruiting events [4].
The intermediate animal may amplify the infection, increasing the c!
hances of transmission to humans.
Bats comprise 20 percent of the diversity of mammalian species, so it
should not be surprising that they are the zoonotic host for a number
of infections. Expert opinion is that they are not over-represented
as hosts for infections [4]. Why infections endemic in bats should be
so pathogenic in humans is less clear, but may relate to the
(currently poorly understood) bat immune system: bats, lacking bone
marrow in their hollow bones, may have different antiviral responses,
possibly including viral inhibitors.
What are the implications for humans and bats in Europe? Horseshoe
bats are widely distributed from Australia to Europe, but the species
cited in the Chinese study are not indigenous to Europe [9]. Bat
migration and trade in bats for traditional medicines have the
potential to introduce new infections into European bat species.
There are also risks from the spillover effect: intermediary species
may be imported having already acquired infection from bats, or could
acquire infections already endemic in European bats [10]. Finally,
global travel and migration mean that new human infections arising
anywhere in the world could potentially become a problem in Europe.

Hollow bones and lack of bone marrow is a flight adaptation common to
birds as well as bats. It is likely just that, a flight adaptation
and an immune status alteration.
Likewise, disease may be passed between species by housing them in
close proximity and in overcrowded conditions, such as those
occurring in many markets in China.
Although there are clearly some diseases associated with bats,
possibly transferred to humans (such as rabies), it is just as likely
that viruses may be obtained from eating unhealthy animals or under
unsanitary conditions, such as eating fruit regurgitated by any
animal.
Incidentally, 5 of the 7 recognized groups of lyssaviruses are bat
viruses. The 2 exceptions are classical carnivore rabies virus and
Mokola virus (vector unknown). - Mods.CP/TG]
