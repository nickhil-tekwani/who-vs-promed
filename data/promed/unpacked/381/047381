At least 33 cases of chikungunya, a mosquito-borne virus, were
reported today [19 Oct 2010] in the Indian capital [Delhi], whose
health authorities already have their hands full with an outbreak of
dengue. According to the chairman of the Delhi Public Health
Committee, VK Monga, all patients identified so far, except one, are
people who have not left the city, so we could be in the presence of
local transmission of the virus.

Last year [2009] only 12 cases of chikungunya were found in Delhi,
and all were individuals who had traveled to Kerala and other
southern states of India which have a high incidence of chikungunya,
Monga said, quoted on Tuesday [19 Oct 2010] by the local media.

He also said that the capital's health authorities to begin to
educate people about the characteristics of the virus, whose symptoms
are similar to those of dengue fever, another disease that had by
yesterday [18 Oct 2010] infected 4614 people in the Indian capital.
[Doubtless significantly underreported, as cases attended in private
clinics are not required to be reported, which may be the situation
for chikungunya virus infections as well. - Mod.TY]

Chikungunya was 1st isolated in 1953, in Tanzania, and since then has
appeared repeatedly in parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It has
also been reported in some Indian Ocean islands. The disease, whose
symptoms are headache and joint pain, fever, nausea, vomiting and
dizziness, is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes of the genus _Aedes
(aegypti_, albopictus_ and _polynesiensis_). Monkeys and other wild
animals that abound in the Indian capital are natural reservoirs of
chikungunya [virus].

[A previous ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20100929.3524) provided the
1st 2010 report of chikungunya cases in Delhi numbering 8, as of 22
Sep 2010. Now, the report above indicates that the total has reached
33, a month later. No evidence is provided to state that monkeys and
other wild animals are, indeed, chikungunya virus reservoirs in Delhi
city. It is much more likely that a viremic person came from an
endemic area in southern India and triggered the outbreak in Delhi.

There are certainly ample _Aedes_ mosquito chickungunya virus vectors
present in the city, since they have been transmitting dengue virus
there for several weeks. The public information effort is reported to
be focused on "virus characteristics" that may, or may not, include
control of the vector -- the only feasible approach to halting both
the dengue and the chikungunya outbreaks. An alert ProMED-mail
subscriber pointed out that the term "chikungunya" is not a Swahili
word, rather a Makonde Bantu word for "contortion."
