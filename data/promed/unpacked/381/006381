5 deaths in Pamplona outbreak of legionellosis
-----------------------------------------------
The Navarrese advisor of health, Santiago Cervera, confirmed the death this
morning of an 82 year old woman in the course of the outbreak of
legionellosis registered in the Hospital Virgin del Camino in Pamplona.
This is the fifth person [to die in the outbreak. Cervera insisted today
that all the patients [had severe [underlying pathologies and that [it
could not be considered [that legionellosis was the direct cause of death.
To date, 19 people have been infected, and 11 remain in hospital.
Legionella has been detected in the hot water facilities of the hospital.

[People with underlying disease are always at the greatest risk during
outbreaks of legionellosis, so reticence in attributing their deaths to the
outbreak is probably not useful. - Mod.ES
