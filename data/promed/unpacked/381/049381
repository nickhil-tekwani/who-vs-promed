Cholera kills 17 in G Bissau
---------------------------
Guinea-Bissau is the latest country in West Africa to be hit with an
outbreak of the deadly waterborne illness cholera, reporting 17
deaths from 1 360 cases since 11 Jun 2005, medical officials said.
Doctor Agostinho Semedo said on Mon, 11 Jul 2005, Bissau's central
hospital was accepting between 60 and 70 cases daily since the
outbreak began, though the number of cases was tapering slightly in
the last couple of days. Health officials say the outbreak has thus
far been limited to the capital Bissau and the neighboring Biombo and
Bula quarters, though a nationwide awareness campaign was in full
swing.
Fears that a resurgence could accompany the rainy season have
mobilized resources from the health ministry, according to minister
Maria Odete Semedo, who said the country was committed to bringing
its awareness campaign to the most remote villages.

Guinea: At least 30 people die of cholera, health officials urge vigilance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A cholera outbreak in Guinea has killed at least 30 people since the
start of the rainy season in late Apr 2005, the head of the
government's disease prevention unit said on Mon, 11 Jul 2005.
Emmanuel-Roland Malano said the water-borne illness had infected 377
people in central and western areas of the country, with the 1st case
showing up in Daara, a district in the south central Fouta Diallon,
from which it is an 100 km trek to the nearest health center.
Once the 1st case broke, cholera spread to at least 230 people
throughout the district Daara -- about 15 percent of the population,
Malano said. The infection, which causes violent diarrhea and
vomiting, rapidly dehydrating the body, has also struck in the
capital, Conakry, some 350 km away.
More than 100 cholera cases have been detected in the capital,
Conakry, the health ministry official said. The prefectures of
Forecariah and Dubreka in the southwest have also reported cases.
Guinea's Health Minister Amara Cisse went on state radio and
television last week to declare the cholera outbreak. He attributed
the spread of the disease to poor sanitation facilities and residents
relying on dirty streams and rivers for their drinking water. Health
ministry officials met aid organizations including Medecins Sans
Frontieres (MSF), the United Nations Children's Fund and the WHO to
coordinate a response to the outbreak.

Cholera Kills 38
----------------
38 people have died in various parts of the country following the
cholera outbreak, with Arua district registering 24 deaths, health
officials said in a statement on 13 Jul 2005.
Cholera killed 14 people in Katanga, one of Kampala's largest slums.
The statement said cholera broke out in Kampala, Arua, Nebbi and Gulu
districts, with 900 people infected.
The Arua district health officer, Alfred Driwale, said, "24 people
died in Arua."
The statement said 905 cases of cholera had been reported in addition
to the deaths, with camps for the displaced people in the north most
affected.
Driwale said, "Following the outbreak, the selling of cooked food has
since been banned in the affected areas, while 11 schools and 2
markets have been closed in Arua."
The release said acute water shortage in internally displaced persons
camps in Gulu, Pader and Kitgum districts had exacerbated the problem
of water-borne diseases.
Peter Muler, the head of Medecins sans Frontiers, said, "People live
on less than 3 liters of water per day, though the international
standard is 15 liters."
"People have 2 options to get that little water; either to queue up
for more than 3 hours each day at different water points or venture
outside the camp, where they risk falling victim to the roaming
rebels," Muler said in an official statement.

other village officials for failing to ensure effective sanitation,

Diarrhea claims 12 lives in Humla
---------------------------------
At least 10 children and 2 elderly people have died of diarrhea and
hundreds of others have been affected by the epidemic at Thehe VDC in
Far western district of Humla in the last week. According to our
correspondent, the villagers of Thehe, adjacent to Simikot, the
district headquarters of Humla, are the victims of the contagious
diarrhea due to prolonged drought and unhygienic living habits.
The villagers have no toilets, and besides this, the dearth of
medical assistants and medicines at the local health post has further
worsened the situation, as many affected people are yet to be treated.
Babu Ram Nepali, acting chief of the district health post said, "A
health team has already been dispatched to the affected area on
receiving the verbal report on spread of the disease, though there
was no written complain from the Thehe VDC."

An epidemic of cholera has affected thousands in the lower-income
areas of Lahore over the past 2 weeks and caused at least 10 deaths,
mainly of small children. The outbreak is blamed -- by residents of
the affected areas, by doctors treating them at emergency medical
camps and by the media -- on contaminated drinking water. The local
health authorities have denied that this is the case.
"The tests on the water samples are not conclusive," Mian Amer
Mehmood said when asked by IRIN.
Even beyond the shantytowns, few residents of the city need
scientific evidence that civic facilities, particularly during the
monsoon season, do not meet even the most basic standards. Over the
past week the streets of the city have filled with water, gutters
have cascaded their content onto roads and mains supplied drinking
water tested by consumers has been found repeatedly to contain
bacteria or rusty sediments.
