Isiolo county government has lifted the meat and milk ban imposed last month [June 2018] following the outbreak of Rift Valley fever [RVF] disease. County livestock minister Mohamud Haji said the disease has been contained. "Following a 13-day successful ring vaccination exercise in affected areas within Isiolo, Merti and Garba Tula sub-counties, we have lifted the ban, and locals can now consume livestock products," said Mr Haji. No new cases of the disease have been reported.

The outbreak only affected livestock, prompting the administration to roll out a vaccination exercise that was co-funded by the Regional Pastoral Livelihoods Resilience Project. At least 300 000 animals in the region were vaccinated, with the process still ongoing in other areas.

The outbreak is suspected to have spread from the neighbouring Wajir County, which lifted its ban on consumption of livestock products last week. Six people and hundreds of livestock died in Wajir County following the outbreak.

[On Mon 16 Jul 2018, Kenya submitted its 4th follow-up report on the RVF epizootic, which had been reportedly affecting the local domestic animal population (camels, sheep, goats, cattle) since its start on 3 Jun 2018. New outbreaks have been reported from the counties Marsabit, Baringo and Meru, bringing the total number of outbreaks to 10 and the number of counties affected by RVF since the start of the event to 7. According to unofficial, reliable sources, the actual area of RVF circulating is wider.

Outbreak summary (as of 16 Jul 2018):
Total outbreaks = 10 (Submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Camelidae / 730 / 33 / 17 / 0 / 0
Goats / 1046 / 52 / 0 / 0 / 0
Sheep / 1380 / 35 / 0 / 0 / 0
Cattle / 270 / 8 / 0 / 0 / 0
Sheep & goats (mixed flocks) / 80 / 2 / 0 / 0 / 0

The above summary, including the detailed data for each outbreak and a summarizing map, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000027246_20180716_172756.pdf. The map shows that the 7 affected counties are located throughout Kenya, from the north east to the south west.

An RVF risk map for eastern Africa, updated on a monthly basis, based upon climatic and ecological indicators used in monitoring areas at risk to RVF activity, is maintained by USDA'a Agricultural Research Service (ARS) in Gainsville, Florida. According to the most recent issue of its "RVF Monitor" (last modified 13 Jul 2018), the RVF Risk Areas -- combining potential virus circulation, vectors, and presence of susceptible populations (humans and animals) -- include for July 2018 the countries Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Somali (south west), South Sudan (east) and Uganda (north east). The said map, "RVF Potential July 2018," can be seen at https://tinyurl.com/yd6m9pzm; (please refer to "5. Region of Focus: East Africa"). - Mod.AS
