At least 40 persons sought treatment at the Piloto health center yesterday
in La Paz, after being bitten by or being exposed to hamsters suspected of
being infected by the rabies virus. The results of tests to confirm or rule
out the suspected diagnosis are pending.
Last Monday, the government of Bolivia declared a health alert, after
laboratory tests confirmed that a hamster that had bitten 2 members of a
family was infected with the rabies virus. The bites were received at a
birthday party at which one of the children received a hamster as a gift.
After the media made the case public, many owners of similar rodents became
concerned when they observed changes of behavior in their pets. Beginning
early yesterday morning, several persons have attended the health center,
some of them with their animals. After being evaluated by health workers,
some were encouraged to monitor the behavior of their pets, while others
received prophylactic vaccination.
Almost every person bitten by the hamsters said that the animals had been
purchased as Christmas presents for their children. According to the
vendors, the hamsters came from Arequipa, Peru. Eduardo Negron, director of
the health center, explained that not all persons require vaccination, but
that it is being administered systematically to children less than 5 years
of age who came in contact with the suspect animals.
Exposed children with a history of bite are being treated with both vaccine
and antiserum, while those with no history of bite are receiving 5 doses of
vaccine.
This is the first time that rodent rabies has been detected in Bolivia. The
fast rate of reproduction of these animals, and the fact that they are in
close contact with humans, are cause for great concern by the health
authorities.
The laboratory results of some rodents that died after biting their owners
will become available today. The sale of hamsters in Bolivia has been
prohibited.

[It is very unusual for hamsters -- or any rodent -- to carry rabies,
principally because they usually die from the effects of the bite of the
rabid animal (dog or cat) before they can get sick. The source of the
infection (bats? in Peru?) needs to be traced. We speculate that they have
chosen to categorically vaccinate the under-5-year-olds because any
self-reported history of bite or saliva contact would be less reliable in
them. - Mods.MPP/JW]
