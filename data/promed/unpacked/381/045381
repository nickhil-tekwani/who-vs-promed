Canadian Surveillance Data 2005 (as of Sat 24 Sep 2005, wk 38)
West Nile Virus National Surveillance Report
Human:
During week 38, 16 West Nile virus (WNV) clinical cases [New Brunswick (1),
Quebec(1),Ontario (7), Manitoba (4), and Saskatchewan (3)] were reported in
Canada . As of 24 Sep 2005, 203 WNV clinical cases and 10 asymptomatic
infections have been reported to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC).
Of the 203 clinical cases, 42 (21 percent) were reported as West Nile
Neurological Syndrome, 149 (73 percent) were reported as West Nile
Non-Neurological Syndrome, and 12 (6 percent) were
Unclassified/Unspecified. To date, there have been 9 deaths [Saskatchewan
(1), Manitoba (1), Ontario (6) and Quebec (1)] in patients with WNV infection.
Bird:
During week 38, 63 dead birds were tested and 9 (14 percent) were reported
positive for WNV (see bird table). A total of 3897 dead birds have been
tested since 2 May 2005, of which 443 (11 percent) were positive for WNV.
Of the 443 positive birds, 328 (74 percent) were identified as American
Crows, 115 (26 percent) were Blue Jays.
Domestic Animal:
As of week 38, 16 horses positive for WNV were reported in Ontario (2),
Manitoba (3), Saskatchewan (10) and Alberta(1).
Mosquito:
As of week 38, 693 mosquito pools positive for WNV were reported in Alberta
(1), Saskatchewan (110), Manitoba (193), Ontario (290) and Quebec (99).
National West Nile virus surveillance data and maps can be found on the
Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) web site at:

The numbers of both human and bird cases of WNV infections are obviously on
the decline. However, the affected mosquito pools and domestic animal
(horse) are still mounting. There must be a reasonable explanation for this
"bipolar" phenomenon. Experts in this field are welcome to share their
opinions with our readers. -Mod.RY]

reported to CDC ArboNET from the following states: Alabama, Arizona,
Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida,
Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri,
Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York,

* Cases with neurologic manifestations (such as WN meningitis, WN
encephalitis, WN myelitis)
** Cases with no evidence of neuroinvasion
*** Illnesses for which insufficient clinical information was provided
**** Total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET by
state and local health departments.
Neuroinvasive Disease refers to severe disease cases, particularly West
Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis.
West Nile fever refers to typically less severe cases that show no evidence
of neuroinvasion. West Nile fever is not currently on the list of
nationally notifiable diseases, and therefore it is optional whether or not
state health departments report these cases to CDC [further explanations of
neuroinvasive West Nile virus disease and West Nile fever are available at
the URL above].
"Other Clinical" includes persons with clinical manifestations other than
WN fever, WN encephalitis or WN meningitis, such as acute flaccid
paralysis. Unspecified cases are those for which sufficient clinical
information was not provided.
Total Human Cases Reported to CDC- These numbers reflect both mild and
severe human disease cases occurring between 1 Jan 2005 through 27 Sep 2005
that have been reported to ArboNet by state and local health departments.
ArboNet is the national, electronic surveillance system established by CDC
to assist states in tracking West Nile virus and other mosquito-borne
viruses. Information regarding 2005 virus/disease activity is posted when
such cases are reported to CDC.
Of the 1804 cases, 696 (39 percent) were reported as West Nile meningitis
or encephalitis (neuroinvasive disease), 993 (55 percent) were reported as
West Nile fever (milder disease), and 115 (6 percent) were clinically
unspecified at this time. Please refer to state health department web sites
for further details regarding state case totals.
Note: The high proportion of neuroinvasive disease cases among reported
cases of West Nile virus disease reflects surveillance reporting bias.
Serious cases are more likely to be reported than mild cases. Also, the
surveillance system is not designed to detect asymptomatic infections. Data
from population-based surveys indicate that among all people who become
infected with West Nile virus (including people with asymptomatic
infections) less than 1 percent will develop severe neuroinvasive disease.

[To date the WNV season for USA seems to have slowed down a bit to coincide
with the approaching of a cooler weather. During the past 2 weeks the total
number of states which reported to CDC of having the WNV cases in
mosquitoes, birds, and other animals remained unchanged at 46, while the
number of States having human cases rose from 38 to 40. - Mod.RY]
