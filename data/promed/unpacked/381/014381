Echovirus 30 and Aseptic Meningitis in Singapore
------------------------------------------------
Echovirus type 30 caused an outbreak in the neonatal nursery at the Kandang
Kerbau Women's and Children Hospital in Singapore in May, 1997; this was
the first recorded isolation of Echovirus type 30 in Singapore. Viruses
were isolated from 8 infants and neonates diagnosed [with meningitis,
sepsis, jaundice, chest infections, or who were contacts of the symptomatic
cases. An additional isolate in October was obtained from the stools of an
infant with myocarditis.
Subsequently, Echovirus type 30 has been isolated in clusters and
separately, every year, from infants with similar presentations.
