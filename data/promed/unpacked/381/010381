Rabies outbreak in northern Peru kills 4 children
-------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of rabies, allegedly spread by vampire bats, has killed 4
children in the Amazonas region of Peru, local press reported today. The
deaths happened last week [2-6 Aug 2010] in the district of Nieva, and the
rabies diagnosis was confirmed by a forensics team sent to the region by
the Ministry of Health.

Eduardo Quezada, chief of the Regional Directorate of Health in Amazonas,
told the press that medical staff has been sent to the area after the
diagnosis confirmation, with 1300 doses of vaccine.

No more new cases have been reported up to now, but the professional
explained that this situation may vary in the near future, since rabies'
incubation period may take days or months.

[Most human cases of vampire bat-transmitted rabies have occurred in the
Amazon region of Brazil and Peru and in some remote communities of
Colombia. Vampire bats are found only in Latin America. Of the 3 known
species -- _Diphylla ecaudata_, _Diaemus youngi_, and _Desmodus rotundus_
(the common vampire) -- only the latter has been known to feed on mammals
and thus has possibly transmitted rabies virus in the human outbreaks studied.

Although the strains of rabies virus carried by vampire bats can be
differentiated antigenically and genetically from rabies viruses associated
with non-vampire bats and mammals the standard human rabies vaccine
provides protection against vampire bat transmitted rabies, pre-exposure
and post-exposure if administered immediately after exposure. It remains to
be confirmed unequivocally that the 4 deceased children died as a results
of vampire bat bites. Further information would be welcomed.
