Please be advised that this is NOT London, UK as indicated in the subject -- it is London, Ontario [Province] in Canada. The mistake is understandable especially given the propensity of London-themed street names and areas that also exist in London, Ontario.

The email that was sent today had that the crow was from London, UK. I believe it was from London, Ontario, Canada.

Re: West Nile virus in London

I think your alert concerning West Nile virus in London refers to London, Ontario, not London, UK.

Correction to location -- WEST NILE VIRUS, WILD BIRD - UNITED KINGDOM: (LONDON) CROW

In case you have not yet received this correction, my colleague Rebecca Stuart noted the location for the below post on WNV is actually London, Ontario, Canada -- NOT United Kingdom.

Here is a link to the Middlesex-London Health Unit news release: https://www.healthunit.com/news-and-events.

Thank you for your attention on this matter.
