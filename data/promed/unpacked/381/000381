A cholera outbreak is continuing to spread in central and southern
Iraq, with 65 new cases registered over the past week, bringing the
total number of confirmed cases to 172, a health ministry spokesman
said on 20 Sep 2008.

"We have registered so far 172 confirmed cases of cholera in 8
provinces: Babil 104 cases, Baghdad 42 cases, Karbala 17 cases, Basra
3 cases, Najaf 2 cases, Anbar 2 cases, Diyala 1 case and Maysan 1
case," said Ihsan Jaafar, director-general of the public health
directorate and spokesman for the ministry's cholera control unit.
Dozens of suspected cases are being tested, Jaafar added.

Despite 40 cases having been diagnosed in Babil Province last week,
Jaafar said that ongoing awareness campaigns have helped limit watery
diarrhea cases, often caused by cholera.

Since the outbreak began in late August 2008, 5 fatalities have been
registered so far: a 10-year-old girl and a 61-year-old man in Babil
province; a 3-year-old boy in Maysan; and an adult and child in
Baghdad. Babil and Maysan are about 100 km and 350 km south of
Baghdad, respectively.

The Iraqi Health Ministry and the World Health Organization have
blamed the country's rundown water and sanitation infrastructure for
the cholera outbreak.

[3] Cholera - Pakistan (Federally Administered Tribal Areas)

Contaminated water and unfavorable environment have caused cholera
and other contagious diseases in a number of people, mostly children,
in the makeshift camp established at Vocational Institute, Pulosa
near here for the displaced persons of Bajaur.

Sources said several people have been admitted to nearby hospitals
that were suffering from cholera and other contagious diseases. They
said there was no arrangement for the provision of clean drinking
water to the victims.

According to an official record, over 4000 displaced persons had been
put up in the camp, while there were only 76 rooms and 170 tents. A
victim, who wished not to be named, said they were being provided
substandard and unhygienic edibles for Iftar [the evening meal
breaking the fast each day during Ramadan]; that, he claimed, was the
main reason for the spread of diseases. They urged the government to
ensure the provision of enough items along with clean drinking water.

[4] Cholera - China (Hong Kong SAR)

The Centre for Health Protection today [20 Sep 2008] confirmed a case
of cholera involving a 25-year-old Tuen Mun man. He developed
gastroenteritis on 13 Sep 2008 and attended Tuen Mun Hospital on 17
Sep 2008. He is now in stable condition in Princess Margaret Hospital.

Tests came back positive for _Vibrio cholerae_ biotype Ogawa.

He did not have a recent travel history, and his home contacts had no
cholera symptoms. This is the 2nd cholera case reported in 2008 [The
1st was imported from the Philippines. - Mod.LL].

[This appears to be a locally acquired case. There were 3 cholera
cases in Hong Kong in 2007, 1 in 2006, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2004, and 7 in 2003.

As a short review, the flagellar (H) antigens of _V. cholerae_ are
shared with many water vibrios and, therefore, are of no use in
distinguishing strains causing epidemic cholera. The O (somatic)
antigens, however, do distinguish strains of _V. cholerae_ into 139
known serotypes. Almost all of these strains of _V. cholerae_ are
nonvirulent. Until the emergence of the Bengal (O139) strain (which
is "non-O1"), a single serotype, designated O1, has been responsible
for epidemic cholera.

There are 3 distinct O1 biotypes, named Ogawa, Inaba, and Hikojima,
each of which may display the "classical" or El Tor phenotype. The
biotypes are distinguished by their expression of surface antigens A,
B, and C. Ogawa contains antigens A and B; Inaba antigens A and C;
and Hikojima antigens A, B, and C. The latter serotype is relatively rare.

[5] Cholera - Zimbabwe (Mashonaland East)

The Zimbabwe health authorities have recorded 17 new cases of
diarrhea and cholera in a suburb in Harare, as a water crisis
continues to wreak havoc in the Zimbabwean capital, a residents'
association said on Saturday [20 Sep 2008].

The Combined Harare Residents Association (CHRA) blamed the outbreaks
in Mabvuku and Tafara suburbs on uncollected refuse, unavailability
of clean water and sewer line blockages. The reports of the new
outbreaks come days after the UN announced it had established 2
emergency treatment centres in Chitungwiza, a town located about 30
km east of Harare, where a cholera outbreak has claimed 11 lives.

UN agencies and other non-governmental organisations were currently
treating more than 80 Chitungwiza residents who have been infected
with the disease, which can be fatal if not treated on time. Similar
outbreaks are feared in other Zimbabwean towns and cities where water
delivery has been poor during the past year due to shortages of
treatment chemicals and constant power cuts, which affect the
government's capacity to pump water.

[6] Cholera - Guinea-Bissau
Date: Wed 17 Sep 2008
Source: Reuters [edited]
<http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnLH686081.html>


A cholera outbreak in Guinea-Bissau has spread, and the death toll
doubled in a month to 122, because many people resist a ban on
funeral customs that propagate the disease, health officials said on
Wednesday [17 Sep 2008]. The outbreak has overwhelmed the weak public
health system in the poor former Portuguese colony in West Africa,
where the risk of water-borne diseases like cholera rises sharply
during the annual rainy season when floods are common.

The Ministry of Health in Bissau said that up to Tuesday [16 Sep
2008], 6461 people had contracted cholera since May 2008, out of whom
122 had died, compared to 59 deaths reported up to 21 Aug 2008.

In a bid to halt the spread of the disease, which had now affected
all of Guinea-Bissau's 11 regions, the government had banned large
traditional funeral and mourning ceremonies because of the risk of
infection involved.

"People gather in large numbers, they greet one another, all these
are factors of propagation," UNICEF spokeswoman in Bissau, Karyna
Silva Gomes, said. "These ceremonies have been prohibited, but there
is resistance to stopping them," she added. Other health experts said
this reluctance to halt traditional burial customs was being
encountered, for example, in the Pepel ethnic communities on the
cashew nut growing Biombo peninsula just north of Bissau.
