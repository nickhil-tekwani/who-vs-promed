[Tillaberi is subject to enzootic outbreaks: bovine outbreaks in 2016 (2), 2015 (1), 2013 (5)), 2010 (1) and 2009 (2), and sheep and goat outbreaks in 2015 (3). All have tended to significant number of losses, which is to be expected when vaccination is retrospective in response to outbreaks instead of proactive annual vaccination. Preventing such outbreaks when the cases numbers are in double digits, e.g., in 2016 there were 83 cattle affected, would be very cost effective. Such significant losses are characteristic of Niger and not just limited to Tillaberi.

For a description of Tillaberi go to Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillab%C3%A9ri_Region. The Wikipedia map has a different position to the province shown in the OIE map. Wikipedia has it bordering Burkina Faso and Mali; OIE has it on the borders with Nigeria and Benin. - Mod.MHJ
