[The melamine adulteration of milk products produced in China
continues to result in the identification of additional food items
that have higher than accepted levels of melamine in them. The below
is an update on such additional findings. The newswire in part [4]
is interesting in it's discussion of possible additional contaminants
that may be mixed with the melamine used in the adulteration process
that may have further potentiated the impact this had on infants and
children exposed to it. - Mod.MPP]

[2] Thailand - biscuits
Date: Tue 14 Oct 2008

The Thai restaurant and bakery S&P said on Tuesday [14 Oct 2008] it
was withdrawing a line of milk cookies sold in Thailand after reports
that Swiss officials had found traces of melamine in the biscuits.

"I have pulled our milk cookies from sale and will submit them for
inspection," Vitoon Sila-on, vice-president for business development
at S&P Syndicate (SNP.BK), told TPBS TV.

Thai newspapers reported that Swiss authorities had pulled the S&P
milk cookies, as well as other products from China and Sri Lanka,
after tests showed they were tainted by melamine.

Products made with tainted Chinese milk have been pulled off shelves
worldwide in a widening health scandal after the industrial chemical
melamine was found in milk and milk formula.

Vitoon said S&P only used milk powder imported from Australia and
condensed milk from a Thai milk producer to make its cookies. He said
the company did not export milk cookies to Switzerland.

Thailand's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it was testing
samples of the milk cookies and expected results in 24 hours.

"Our initial finding shows that S&P has exported 3 kinds of cookies
-- butter cookies, almond cookies, and chocolate chip cookies -- only
to Germany," the FDA said in a statement.

The FDA said it has collected 519 samples of products sold in
Thailand that contain milk, including cookies, and found no melamine
in those products.

[3] USA - products identified

No doubt you've heard about the contaminated milk that's sickened
more than 50 000 children in China, hospitalized 13 000, and caused
fatal kidney damage in at least 3. Some 60 countries have now banned
or recalled certain Chinese dairy products, including baby formulas
and chocolates, because of contamination with melamine. That chemical
can produce crystals that block tiny tubes in the kidneys,
interfering with the production of urine and damaging the organ.

Melamine is the same chemical that contaminated pet food last year
[2007] and killed many cats and dogs. As we warned then, the
appearance of a problem in pet food could signal a looming problem
for our food supply too. (Marion Nestle, PhD, a New York University
food expert who has an informative blog that's covered melamine,
recently wrote a book called "The Chihuahua in the Coal Mine" about just that.)

The Food and Drug Administration and other organizations are now
trying to determine how widespread and severe the problem really is.
In the meantime, here are answers to 3 common questions about melamine.

1. What foods available in this country might be contaminated?
a. Infant formulas sold in Asian markets. The FDA says investigators
have visited more than 1400 retail markets without finding any
Chinese formulas on the shelves, but advises that you avoid any
formula with a label that says it was manufactured in China, and to
not buy formula online.
b. Mr Brown instant coffee and tea products. The Taiwanese
manufacturer of these products has recalled them from the US market
because of melamine contamination, though some may still be on shelves.
c. White Rabbit Creamy Candy. The New York Times reported on
Wednesday [1 Oct 2008] that this popular and widely exported Chinese
chocolate has been found in several locations throughout the country,
most recently in Connecticut. The paper reported that tests conducted
on those samples have detected melamine.
d. Blue Cat Flavor Drinks. The distributor of the product, Tristar
Food Wholesale Co. Inc., initiated a recall of several flavors of
Blue Cat Flavor Drink, based on recent FDA tests. The drink, also
called Lanmao, comes in 4 flavors -- strawberry, sweet orange,
pineapple, and peach. It's sold mainly in Asian markets.
e. High-protein powders. These often contain concentrated amounts of
dairy byproducts-notably casein, whey, and milk protein concentrates
(MPCs) -- but the source of those ingredients is often unclear,
making it possible they come from milk that originated in China.
Regulations that require many foods to identify their country of
origin don't extend to all ingredients. (For other exemptions, see
our recent report on so-called COOL food labels.)

Casein, whey, and MPCs are also often added to many other packaged
and processed foods, including processed cheese, though probably in
much smaller amounts. The FDA's preliminary safety assessment
suggests that those levels -- except for infants -- pose little
threat to health. But it's unclear what effect long-term exposure to
small amounts of the chemical might have on the kidney. And, as the
blog Diabetes Update indicates, some people worry that may pose
special risks to people with existing kidney disease due to diabetes.

Our safety blog keeps an up-to-date list
(<http://blogs.consumerreports.org/safety/latest-recalls.html>) of
all recalled products. Or check <http://www.recalls.gov/>.

2. What are the warning signs of melamine poisoning?
The resulting kidney damage is most likely to cause:
a. Blood in the urine
b. Reduced urine output
c. High blood pressure
For more, see our table on the signs and symptoms of kidney disease
(<http://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/health-safety/kidney-disease-silent-killer-on-the-rise-3-08/how-to-read-your-urine/how-to-read-your-urine.htm>).

3. What should you do if you suspect melamine poisoning or kidney problems?
Call your doctor. As we reported in April 2008, doctors can now use
an improved blood test to get accurate and fast results. Early
diagnosis combined with prompt treatment provides the best chance of
preventing the damage from becoming chronic.

[4] Melamine scrap
Date: Wed 8 Oct 2008
Source: The Epoch Times [edited]
<http://en.epochtimes.com/n2/china/melamine-china-milk-powder-5370.html>


Milk poison could come from melamine scrap
------------------------------------------
Melamine is a basic organic chemical intermediate, with chemical
formula C3H6N6. It is commonly produced from urea, and contains 66
percent nitrogen by mass.

Nitrogen is a very important building stone of all living beings. The
element is an essential ingredient of proteins, which make up most of
the human body that isn't bone or water. As such, making nitrogen
measurement is a common practice for protein content estimation. The
Kjeldahl and Dumas testing methods are the standard tests used in the
food industry for measuring total nitrogen in crude protein content
while they can be misguided by adding nitrogen-rich compounds such as melamine.

Melamine use as non-protein nitrogen (NPN) to feed cattle was issued
in a U.S. patent in 1958. The patent lasted 20 years and was later
banned due to inefficiency as a NPN source for ruminant.

In China's melamine-tainted milk scandal, melamine as a nitrogen-rich
substance is illegally added to baby formula in order to increase the
apparent protein content and pass the quality tests, though the
chemical has no nutritional value.

....melamine is only slightly soluble in water, it, when is being
illegally added into milk products, will be dissolved in formaldehyde
(carcinogen) or other organic solvents before mixing into the milk.
Experts doubt that dairy farmers, who were blamed for the tainted
milk scandal, would know such complicate chemical compound technique.

In addition, melamine by itself is non-toxic in low doses. However,
when melamine combines with cyanuric acid in water or diet to form
melamine cyanurate, it will lead to fatal kidney stones or renal problems.

According to David Bradley's article posted on Sciencebase.com on 17
Sep 2008], melamine is described as being "Harmful if swallowed,
inhaled or absorbed through the skin. Chronic exposure may cause
cancer or reproductive damage. Eye, skin and respiratory irritant."
However, the toxic dose is on a par with common table salt with an
LD50 of more than 3 grams per kilogram of bodyweight, he added.

He says, "But, if melamine has low toxicity then what is it that has
poisoned thousands of babies in China and why has this scandal
occurred? Well, LD50, the toxic dose issue, tells us something about
acute exposure not the apparent six-month's worth of accumulated
exposure these babies have suffered. Chronic exposure to melamine can
lead to bladder or kidney stones and even bladder cancer and as we
have learned, acute kidney failure."

In the end, he points out the fact [that the] melamine added to the
milk may not be pure.

Melamine Scrap
-------------
Melamine scrap, small acorn-sized chunks of white rock, is a
by-product from processing of coal into melamine. It has been
reported by [the] New York Times on [30 Apr 2007], following China's
melamine-tainted pet food scandal last year, that melamine scrap is
widely incorporated into livestock and fish feed in parts of China.

According to the report, nitrogen-rich melamine scrap is routinely
ground into powder and mixed into low-grade wheat, corn, soybean or
other proteins to inflate the protein analysis of animal feed. Such
melamine powder has been called "fake protein" and is used to deceive
animal farmers into thinking they are buying feed that provides
higher nutrition value.

The practice is widespread in China. For years many animal feed
sellers have been able to cheat buyers by blending a powdered form of
the scrap into feed with little regulatory supervision, according to
interviews with melamine scrap traders and agricultural workers here,
described in the report.

The resulting melamine-tainted feed would be weak in protein but, by
using melamine additive, the feed seller makes a huge profit because
melamine scrap is much cheaper than soy, wheat or corn protein.

"It is possible that melamine is added into soybean meal, a cheap
source of protein products, or other milk additives before dairy
producers buy, or it is adulterated by the milk powder manufacturers
themselves," said [an] insider.

If the melamine contained in the milk powder or liquid milk comes
from adding melamine scrap, there will be more ingredients to be worried about.

A reporter in Caijing learned that as an impure form of the chemical,
such leftover melamine scrap often contains urea, ammonia, silica,
potassium nitrate, sodium nitrite, acetic acid, and activated carbon.
Sodium nitrite is also internationally recognized as a carcinogen.
According to China's State Administration of Quality Supervision,
Inspection and Quarantine (SAQSIQ), the content of melamine in Sanlu
baby milk powder products is as high as 2563 milligrams per kilogram.
Some industry insiders said that the high concentration of melamine
in some brands of milk powder could be linked to hidden operating
rules for milk powder manufacturers.
