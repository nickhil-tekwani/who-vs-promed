Syphilis numbers continue to climb in and around Columbus [Ohio], and health officials say anonymous and unprotected sex is fueling the surge in new cases.

Dr. Jose A. Bazan, medical director of the sexual-health clinic at Columbus Public Health, said it's imperative that people realize that oral, vaginal and anal sex can all spread the disease and that routine condom use can cut the risk.

Ohio's overall syphilis rate per 100 000 people crept up from 9.5 to 10.5 from 2013 to 2014, according to state data. In Franklin County [the city of Columbus is the seat of Franklin County], the rate increased from 25 to 31.5 in that same year. Hamilton County [the city of Cincinnati] had the only higher rate last year, at more than 35 cases per 100 000 people. Two other central Ohio counties -- Pickaway and Union [Union County is part of the Columbus metropolitan area]-- had rates above the state average, at more than 23 and 11, respectively.

Data from the 1st 5 months of 2015 show that Franklin County is on track to see even more cases this year, Bazan said. Through the end of May [2015], 175 cases were reported.

From 2005 to 2013, the number of U.S. syphilis cases nearly doubled, from 8724 to 16 663, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] reported. The increase largely has been attributed to infections in gay men.

In 2014, Clark, Cuyahoga and Lucas counties joined Franklin County in reporting significant increases in the bacterial disease, which also can pass from mother to fetus and can be fatal to babies if undetected. Because syphilis symptoms can resemble signs of other diseases, it's important for doctors and nurses to be on alert so they can make quick diagnoses, prescribe antibiotic treatments and ensure that infected people don't keep spreading the disease, Bazan said. The initial painless sore that appears at the onset of infection can be confused with an ingrown hair, zipper cut or a harmless bump, according to the CDC. And other later symptoms, such as body rash, swollen glands and vision problems, might not naturally set a doctor on the path to diagnosing a sexually transmitted disease, Bazan said.

Columbus Public Health drew doctors' attention to the increase in syphilis last year [2014] and is preparing to do so again, he said. Besides looking for potential cases transmitted through sex, doctors also should give pregnant women regular tests -- 3 per pregnancy is the recommendation, Bazan said. "Sometimes people think syphilis is a disease from a long, long time ago. They don't realize that we are seeing an increase," said Dr. Mary DiOrio, medical director for the Ohio Department of Health.

Many people with syphilis diagnoses are young men who have sex with men [MSM], and they are disproportionately African-American, Bazan said. That said, there also is an increase in cases among women, he said.

For young men, sexual encounters that are anonymous or close to anonymous have been made easier through smartphone apps that connect willing partners, Bazan said. "You don't know much if anything about the person that you're having sex with," he said. Columbus Public Health has tried to reach at-risk people through social media and will continue to deliver safe-sex messages that way, said spokesman Jose Rodriguez.

[A prior ProMED-mail post (Syphilis - USA (11): (OH) MSM, congenital, rising incidence, RFI 20141006.2837388) reported that there was a rising incidence of syphilis in Franklin County, Ohio, in men who have sex with men (MSM), some of whom also had wives and girlfriends, which contributed to the concurrent rising incidence of congenital syphilis. The news report above adds that the increase in cases of syphilis is occurring among young MSM who are disproportionately African-American and is accompanied by an increase in cases among women.

In many localities, the increased incidence of syphilis occurring in MSM has been characterized by high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection. If this pattern is occurring in Franklin County, there may also be also an increase in the incidence of congenital HIV infection. ProMED-mail would appreciate more information on the syphilis outbreak in Ohio from a knowledgeable source.

Franklin County, with a population of 1 212 263 in 2013, is located in the center of the U.S. state of Ohio; its county seat is the city of Columbus (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_County,_Ohio). - Mod.ML
