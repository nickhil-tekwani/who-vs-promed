MINAMATA DISEASE IN THE AMAZON: THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG
Montreal, January 29, 1999.
The recent revelation of 3 cases of Minamata disease, identified by
Japanese researchers in a village on the Tapajos River in the Brazilian
Amazon, is only the tip of the iceberg concerning the situation of mercury
pollution in the Amazon. Over the last ten years, an increasing number of
studies have reported mercury contamination of fish in the various rivers
of the Amazon region, and relatively high mercury levels in the hair of
riverine populations for whom fish constitute the dietary mainstay. Up
until recently, it was believed that the widespread mercury contamination
came primarily from the use of this metal in gold-mining. Our research
group from the University of Quebec in Montreal and the Federal
Universities of Para and Rio de Janeiro have shown that the mercury
released into the atmosphere from the gold-mining activities, while highly
toxic for the miners and workers who burn the gold-mercury amalgam and the
populations living around the gold-mining areas and the shops in the towns
and cities that further burn the amalgam, remains in the local environment.
Our studies and others strongly suggest that in areas remote from the gold
mines, the mercury in the extensive Amazonian waterways comes from soil
lixiviation of natural mercury following 'slash and burn' agricultural
practices. Following deforestation, mercury leaches from the soil which
contains high levels of this metal. (For a description see: Roulet et al.
Science of the Total Environment 1998; 223:1-24).
Our international research group has likewise examined early neurological
deficits in riverine populations who do not display clinical manifestations
of Minamata disease. These studies reveal that motor and visual functions
decrease with increasing hair mercury, at levels well below 50 ppm. (median
values: 11 ppm). These findings show that even in the absence of overt
disease, mercury is affecting the well-being of these populations (See:
Lebel et al. Neurotoxicology 1996; 17:157-167; Lebel et al. Environmental
Research 1998; 79:20-32).
The tremendous biodiversity in the fish resources is reflected in the
differences in mercury levels in the abundant fish species. This in turn,
is reflected in hair mercury concentration of fish-eaters. Herbivorous fish
contain very little mercury and those who eat predominantly herbivorous
fish have less mercury than those who eat predominantly piscivorous fish.
There are seasonal variations in hair mercury levels, dependent on the
bioavailability of different fish species during the rainy and the dry
seasons (See: Lebel et al. Water, Air & Soil Pollution 1997; 97:31-44).
The Amazonian ecosystem is very complex and much work must be done to
understand what is happening and instigate mitigation measures. Researchers
from Canada and Brazil, with local NGOs are currently involved in a pilot
project in a small village on the Tapajos River, whose objective is to work
with the community to find short, medium and long term solutions. Since
fish is the major source of protein and is beneficial to their health and
well-being, the short term solution seeks to inform the villagers of the
mercury levels in various fish species and work with them to modify their
diet in such a way as to increase the proportion of fish with low mercury
levels. On the medium term, the factors that favor methylation will be
determined, allowing us to identify 'hot spots' in the river. And, on a
more long term basis, we have begun to work with the local farmers on
reforestation projects...
There is much to be done in this area. In 1989, UNAMAZ, the Union of
Amazonian Universities held a meeting on mercury, pointing out the growing
dangers of mercury in the Amazonian environment. Ten years later, in
January 1999, we organized a meeting in Santarem, a city at the junction of
the Amazon and Tapajos Rivers to establish a collaborative network of
researchers and NGOs working on the issues of mercury contamination in the
Amazon. NGOs from the region and researchers from Santarem, Belem,
Brasilia, Manaus, Bahia, Rio de Janeiro in Brazil and from Venezuela, Peru,
Ecuador, Canada and the United States attended the meeting and set up the
Forum on Mercury Contamination of the Amazonian Ecosytem on the outreach
campus of the Federal University of Para in Santarem. We will soon be
setting up a website. The International Development Research Center has
provided funding to initiate this endeavor and we are seeking funding from
other sources to pursue it.
