In North Dakota, pelicans abandon breeding ground, baffling researchers
-------------------------------------------------
Right now from the verdant bluff looming over a remote section of
shoreline, an observer ought to be able to peer down at swarms of American
white pelicans squawking, fluttering and going about the fowl business of
breeding. Yet this year, that perch's vista is instead one of baffling
desolation, a plain of baby chick carcasses and hundreds of never-to-hatch
eggs simply left behind for the snacking pleasure of hungry coyotes and gulls.
In a quirky and unprecedented natural mystery, the world's largest breeding
colony for the birds is eerily vacant. The more than 30 000 pelicans that
usually spend the summer procreating at Chase Lake National Wildlife Refuge
in central North Dakota returned in their usual droves in April from their
winter residence on the Gulf Coast, but then they suddenly dispersed in May
after starting an apparently normal breeding season.
Nobody knows for sure why. One biologist, Ron Reynolds of the US Fish and
Wildlife Service in Bismarck, ND, said the birds' diaspora is "as
mysterious as crop circles". Theories abound, ranging from possible new
predators or climate shifts causing disruptions, but there is little
conclusive evidence to make them more than conjecture.
Only humans, with minimal access to a region that is 10 miles from the
nearest paved road, have largely escaped suspicion. "Obviously, this is a
shock to us," said Chase Lake refuge manager Mick Erickson. "To see
something like this happen within a relatively short period of time is both
surprising and disheartening. We just don't have any concrete answers as to
what kind of event could have caused a mass abandonment like this. . . .
We've never heard of any event of this scale ever happening."
Chase Lake, about 60 miles east of Bismarck, was established as a protected
area in 1908 by President Theodore Roosevelt to save the dwindling number
of pelicans from hunters at a time when the feathers were fashionable in
hats and other garments. There were then about 100 pelicans, or 50 breeding
pairs; the colony peaked in 2000 at 17 500 pairs on the 4385 acre (1775 ha)
site.
None of the other 27 breeding colonies in 11 states and 4 Canadian
provinces comes close to those figures, said pelican expert Tommy King of
the Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
in Starkville, Miss. During a normal mating season, the pelicans build
nests and lay as many as 2 eggs in May. Both parents take turns squatting
on the eggs to incubate them. Then one parent tends to newborn chicks while
the other forages in a 100 mile radius for fish or salamanders for food.
Mating occurs only once a year, so a disruption such as this means a
slowdown in reproduction. The birds are not a threatened or endangered
species, though, so the incident is not viewed as a serious setback to the
species' survival, Reynolds said.
Since May, the Chase Lake birds appear to have dispersed across the
Dakotas, Minnesota, and southern Canada, according to reports from those
regions with sudden influxes in pelicans. "Normally we may not see any at
all this time of year, but the last 3 or 4 weeks we've seen 1000 to several
thousand," said Wayne Brininger, manager of the Tamarac National Wildlife
Refuge in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota, about 200 miles east of Chase Lake.
"They aren't breeding here. They're just loafing on our lakes and feeding."
Researchers first noticed the abandonment at Chase Lake in late May when
they made a routine visit to a peninsula where most of the breeding usually
occurs only to find few adult pelicans, some chick carcasses and hundreds
of eggs raided by coyotes and gulls. The remaining birds were strikingly
nervous around the humans, taking flight when researchers came near instead
of walking calmly away as they usually do, said biologist Marsha Sovada of
the Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center in nearby Jamestown, ND.
That gave rise to the first theory, that coyotes had moved into the area in
unusual numbers and scared off the colony. West Nile virus had killed off
thousands of chicks in 2003, so researchers wondered whether the coyotes
feasted on those remains during the winter and decided the area was a
viable hunting ground for them during the summer, too. But that theory was
suspect from the start, because there was no littering of adult pelican
carcasses to suggest such destruction, and it failed to explain the next
discovery of abandonment on 1 of 2 islands on the lake where nesting also
occurs. Coyotes would not have had access to that area, Sovada said. The
same thinking is ruling out a disease outbreak; adult birds would probably
have been found dead alongside their young.
By early June, the other island where breeding occurs also was abandoned.
King attached global positioning chips to 4 of the pelicans on the 2nd
island in late May before they dispersed, and he found that they fled the
area between May 30 and June 2. Their paths -- each in a different
direction -- show that something prompted the birds to fan out in haphazard
routes, further deepening the mystery.
Another theory blames a cool, wet spring for stressing the birds and making
food more difficult to find. Both May and June have been among the coldest
on record for the area, National Weather Service meteorologist Janine
Vining said, and the Chase Lake area had 3 inches more rain in May than
usual. "Abnormally cool weather puts greater physical demands on adult
pelicans and may have changed the availability of food source," said
Reynolds of the US Fish and Wildlife Service. "That doesn't mean the food
isn't out there, but it may be harder to access if small fish are not
swimming in shallow waters where the pelicans forage. These birds may need
more food and, at the same time, they're balancing the demands of nesting
and raising chicks. It could be that amid a little bit of added strain,
they chose survival over reproduction."
Experts say they are unlikely to find a conclusive answer -- and they do
not know whether the pelicans will return next spring. If not, it would be
a significant blow to a region that so treasures its association with Chase
Lake that a pelican is painted onto the water tower in Medina, a tiny burg
of 500 residents about 10 miles from the refuge.
