France banned exports of animals at risk for Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD)
yesterday as Europe went on high alert in a bid to stop the highly
contagious virus from spreading from Britain.
After a series of false alarms, Germany, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark, and
France said yesterday they had no confirmed cases of the disease, which has
ravaged 70 farms in Britain and Northern Ireland since the first cases were
discovered on 19 Feb 2001.
But with the risk of infection still high - and European livestock already
struggling against an epidemic of mad cow disease - authorities want people
to know they are doing their utmost to block the disease. Unlike mad cow
disease, FMD cannot be passed on to humans. But a continent-wide outbreak
would deal another economic blow to an industry suffering from plummeting
beef sales and consumer panic.
FMD disease affects cloven-hoofed animals like sheep, pigs and cows. It is
extremely difficult to contain, since the virus can be carried for miles by
the wind, people, or cars. It can also be spread by contaminated hay, water
and manure. France decided yesterday to virtually shut down its livestock
business, banning the export of animals at risk for 15 days and banning all
movement of such animals inside the country, except those being taken to
slaughter-houses.
Horses were also banned from travelling inside France, making it likely
French racehorses will be withdrawn from next week's Cheltenham Festival in
England. The stringent French measures came after tests on 9 herds in 5
departments showed traces of FMD. Initial examinations showed the animals,
which had been imported from Britain, had produced antibodies after being
in contact with the virus.
"These analyses show these animals were in contact with the virus... but we
do not know... whether they were carriers of the illness," Agriculture
Minister Jean Glavany told a news conference. All the affected animals had
been slaughtered as part of a government decision to kill 20 000 imported
sheep and 30 000 French sheep that had been in contact with the British
animals. Authorities took more drastic precautions within a 3 km radius
around the 9 farms. Vehicles traveling in this area must be disinfected,
and people leaving the area are required to step in a disinfectant solution.
"We think we must react... in a rapid and immediate way because it is
better to act when there are antibodies present in the animal and when the
disease has not yet been declared," French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
said during a trip to the Cher region.
