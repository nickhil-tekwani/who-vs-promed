This press release just came out from the founder of the University of
Minnesota's Raptor Center regarding the disease. I have never seen our
flight room so full of great-horned owls as I did this weekend.

Raptors Dying of West Nile Virus
---------------------------------------------
The Raptor Center at the University of Minnesota College of Veterinary
Medicine is receiving reports from all over the Midwest about raptors sick
or dead from the West Nile virus, says Dr. Pat Redig, The Raptor Center's
director.
"As of 23 Aug 2002, there have been confirmed cases of West Nile virus
causing death in raptors in Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan,
Missouri, Nebraska, and Ohio -- most since July 15," he says. "There are
many more suspected cases, and the geographical distribution and range of
species affected changes every couple of days. In recent days, it seems to
have hit Minnesota."
Kathryn A. Converse, wildlife disease specialist with the National Wildlife
Health Center in Madison, Wis., confirms that her organization has received
reports of increasing numbers of raptors being picked up sick or dead in
Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, and Iowa. "Ohio has reported well over
100 great horned owls and red-tailed hawks, and each of the other states
have estimated "'dozens' of birds," she says.
According to the U.S. Geological Survey, each of the contiguous states
except Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and Washington had suspected or confirmed
cases of West Nile virus in birds as of 21 Aug 2002. Raptor species
reported to the Centers for Disease Control's West Nile Virus avian
mortality database include bald eagles, golden eagles, ospreys, merlins,
Cooper's hawks, and several species of owls. Even companion birds, from
zebra finches (a tiny bird native to Australia) to macaws (a large,
colorful parrot native to South America) are reported to have died from the
virus. As The Raptor Center works to get the word out to nature centers and
zoos that have captive raptors, it continues to receive dozens of calls and
e-mails a day from concerned veterinarians, wildlife rehabilitators, and
others who care for birds of prey.
Their main questions: How can we protect raptors and other birds from the
West Nile virus? Is there a vaccine?
The single best way to prevent West Nile virus in birds is by protecting
them from mosquito bites, Redig says. While there is a vaccine for horses,
veterinarians don't know for sure whether the vaccine will work for other
species. "What we know so far is that 2 doses can be given 3 to 4 weeks
apart with no apparent side effects, at least in birds tested to date,"
Redig explains. "We have no idea if this confers protection, but it doesn't
appear to do any harm and it may prep the immune system to react more
vigorously if the bird becomes infected."
The Raptor Center's first suspected case of West Nile virus was in a great
horned owl admitted 23 Aug 2002 from Dakota County, for which it is
awaiting test results from the Minnesota Department of Health. They are
also admitting an unusually high number of owls and hawks some from other
states such as Iowa, Illinois, and Ohio in which West Nile virus is
"strongly suspected."
In the meantime, The Center has 101 patient eagles, hawks, owls, and
falcons, and about 30 education birds that it is trying to protect from the
virus. Many birds normally housed outdoors have been brought inside, and
the usually bright and airy education courtyard is shrouded in dark
mosquito netting. Staff and volunteers are at work stapling more netting to
outdoor cages and flight pens.
"We're doing whatever we can to protect these birds," Redig says. "These
raptors are very special, very important, to all of us."
Established in 1974, The Raptor Center at the University of Minnesota
College of Veterinary Medicine specializes in the medical care,
rehabilitation, conservation, and study of eagles, hawks, owls, and
falcons. In addition to treating approximately 700 birds a year, the
internationally known program provides training in raptor medicine and
surgery for veterinarians from around the world, reaches more than 250 000
people each year through public education programs and events, and
identifies emerging issues related to raptor health and populations. The
majority of its funding comes from private donations.
