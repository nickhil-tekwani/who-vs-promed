A total of 18 people have become ill after a bird show in Weurt, near
Nijmegen in the east of the Netherlands. 7 people had to be taken to
hospital with a serious form of pneumonia. The Dutch health
authorities have diagnosed them with psittacosis or parrot fever. The
disease is carried by parrots and can be fatal, if not treated promptly.

All the victims were bird handlers, one of them was a judge. Up to
now, no visitors to the bird show have reported sick. More than 150
people visited the Weurt bird show. In Druten, just 15 km (9.3 mi)
away, a bird show scheduled for this weekend [17-18 Nov 2007] has
been cancelled as a precautionary measure.

[Psittacosis, also called parrot fever or ornithosis, is a zoonosis
caused by _Chlamydophila psittaci_ (formerly _Chlamydia psittaci_),
an obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen. The infection has
worldwide distribution and occurs in many types of both domestic and
wild birds, not just psittacine birds as its name, psittacosis,
implies. Even mammals such as goats, cows, and sheep may be infected.

The infection in birds may be latent, but when stressed by crowding
or prolonged transport the birds can develop conjunctivitis,
respiratory distress, and diarrhea. The microorganism is shed in
liquid feces and respiratory secretions. When the feces dry, the
organisms can become airborne as droplet nuclei that remain suspended
in air, traveling widely by air currents. The dried organisms can
remain viable for months at room temperature.

Humans become infected by inhalation of these infectious aerosols.
The incubation period generally is 5-14 days following exposure. From
experimental studies in monkeys exposed to infectious aerosols, the
earliest lesion is thought to be a respiratory bronchiolitis,
followed by centrifugal spread that results in a lobular pneumonia
(McGavran MH, et al: The pathogenesis of psittacosis. Serial studies
on rhesus monkeys exposed to a small-particle aerosol of the Borg
strain. Am J Path 1962; 40: 653-70). The illness in humans presents
as an atypical pneumonia syndrome that can resemble influenza
pneumonia. The organisms are also thought to spread systemically via
the blood stream and cause on occasion a typhoid-like syndrome,
hepatitis, myocarditis, pericarditis, endocarditis, neurologic
involvement, or nephritis. The diagnosis is suspected on the basis of
atypical pneumonia that follows exposure to birds, and is usually
confirmed serologically, or by means of a culture or PCR (polymerase
chain reaction) of respiratory secretions.

ProMED-mail recently posted (see 20071130.3868) a case of psittacosis
in a Dutch poultry worker exposed to ducks in Germany and in 1996
ProMED-mail posted (see 19960129.0207) an outbreak of psittacosis
that involved 7 of 15 customs officers who had been in contact for
more than 2 hours with parakeets while the birds were held in the
customs office. The current outbreak in the Netherlands so far only
involves 18 bird handlers, 7 of whom required hospitalization. These
bird handlers undoubtedly had more intense bird exposure than the
more than 150 uninvolved visitors to the bird show. The incubation
period and the attack rate among the bird handlers are not specified.
Also how the diagnosis of psittacosis was established is not
specified; confirmation requires culture of the microorganism or
identification of the microorganism by PCR in respiratory secretions,
or serology from acute and convalescent serum samples drawn 2 weeks apart.

Other diagnostic possibilities for an atypical pneumonia following
bird exposure include avian influenza and an acute hypersensitivity
reaction that can occur several hours after inhalation of aerosolized
bird proteins. Newcastle disease virus, a paramyxovirus, causes
primarily conjunctivitis, with minimal constitutional symptoms 1-2
days after exposure to infected birds; pneumonia in immunocompetent
individuals due to this virus would be very unusual
(<http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/JVI.01406-07v1>).
_Histoplasma capsulatum_, which is a soil organism, can cause
atypical pneumonia following inhalation of an infectious aerosol of
microconidia when contaminated soil, which has been fertilized by
bird or bat guano, is disturbed by, for example, bulldozing or razing
old buildings. Unlike birds, bats shed the fungus from their
gastrointestinal tract and spelunkers who explore caves infested by
bats are at risk of acquiring the disease. _Cryptococcus neoformans_
causes usually an asymptomatic pulmonary infection in immunocompetent
individuals following inhalation of aerosolized soil or dust
contaminated with bird guano.
