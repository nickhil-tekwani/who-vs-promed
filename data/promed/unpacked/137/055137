Campinas (in Sao Paulo) on this [Fri 24 March 2017] confirmed the deaths of 3 monkeys from yellow fever. According to the municipal Secretariat of Health, tests were done by the Instituto Adolfo Lutz indicating that the 3 animals that died on the Santa Lídia farm in the rural area of the Sousas district were victims of the disease.

According to the agency, with the confirmation, nearly 1000 [human] residents of the Sousas rural area will be vaccinated against yellow fever this weekend [25-26 March 2017]. The agents will carry out the vaccination house-to-house, starting this [Sat 25 Mar 2017]. The city reported that there have been no human cases in the Campinas region so far.

The Director of Campinas Health Surveillance, Andrea von Zuben, explains that the animals found dead in the municipality had the sylvatic [transmission] form of the disease. Because of this, residents who wish to visit the Sousas rural areas or Joaquim Egídio must be vaccinated previously or apply [mosquito] repellant every 2 hours.

In the region, 1 animal was found dead in Socorro (Sao Paulo) and another 6 monkeys have just been confirmed with yellow fever, with 4 in Amparo (SP) and 2 in Monte Alegre do Sul (SP).

In January [2017], the Campinas Secretary of Health, Carmino de Souza, said that the likelihood of infections of the disease in the municipality was remote. The Director explained that the phrase used by the Secretary relates to the urban version of the disease, which has not occurred in the country for 40 years. Andrea stated that all the forests in Campinas are being monitored. "We are doing monitoring in all the forests looking for this mosquito [...], the one that does not come into houses like _Aedes_ does," she concluded.

[The virus continues to circulate and expand, and behold, with its arrival to another area in which there has been no previous recommendation for [yellow fever] vaccination. The recommendation for vaccination, now, emerges in one of the most populated regions of the state of São Paulo. The indication for vaccination of the population of Campinas [municipality] and some of the neighboring municipalities is in place. It remains to be seen what the capability of the National Immunization Program will be to meet the demand for doses -- hundreds of thousands of doses - that will now be necessary for the metropolitan region of Campinas.

Once again, the question is: are there sufficient doses for the necessary response? If not, if the number of doses is not able to meet the increasing demand for control purposes, it is cause for concern. Contingency actions have not yet been implemented, especially the fractionation of doses, a strategy successfully used to control the epidemic in Angola [and the Democratic Republic of the Congo]. - Mod.RNA, in Portuguese, trans.

[Another report similar to the one above was published in CBN Campinas on [Fri 24 Mar 2017] and posted on ProMED-PORT. It essentially provides the same information as the above report (http://www.portalcbncampinas.com.br/2017/03/campinas-confirma-febre-amarela-em-macacos-encontrados-mortos-em-sousas/ in Portuguese).

The monkey species that were found dead of yellow fever are not stated. Very likely, they were brown howlers (Alouatta guariba), a species that has often been found dead of YF virus infection in the forest during the current outbreak.

[2] Vaccination for travelers

The health ministry [of Brazil] says several countries are requesting that people traveling from Brazil be immunized against yellow fever amid the worst outbreak of the disease the country has seen in years.

The ministry says on its website that Panama, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Costa Rica, Ecuador and Cuba are demanding that people arriving in their countries from Brazil present an international certificate of yellow fever vaccination. The certificate was not required by these countries before the outbreak.

The latest figures from the health ministry show that 449 people have been infected with yellow fever and 144 have died.

Mosquitoes transmit yellow fever, which causes fever, body aches, vomiting and sometimes jaundice.

[Countries requiring yellow fever vaccination for entry should add all countries reporting YF cases to their list, not just Brazil. - Mod.MPP]

[The concern about entry of individuals viremic with yellow fever (YF) virus is a legitimate concern. All of these countries have significant population of _Aedes aegypti_ YF virus vector mosquitoes and ongoing transmission of the virus could occur. All the countries on the above list, except Ecuador, are free of YF and their populations are susceptible to infection because they have not been vaccinated. Health authorities in the USA have expressed similar concerns because of the presence of _Aedes aegypti_ in the southeastern states. YF virus is endemic in the Ecuador Amazon Basin. - Mod.TY
