FEVER & BIRDWATCHING - SEYCHELLES, TANZANIA (8)
===============================================
[This reply refers to #6, posting by Charlie Calisher]
It may be a longshot but a recent publication by Olsen et al entitled
"Transhemispheric Exchange of Lyme Disease Spirochetes by Seabirds'
published in J Clin Microbiol 33:3270-74,1995 might allow one to at
least consider Lyme disease as part of any differential diagnosis
following exposure around seagulls.
