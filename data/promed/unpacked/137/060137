[Michigan] state health officials are urging parents to ensure their children are up-to-date on vaccines after chickenpox outbreaks in several counties, including 2 in West Michigan. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services [MDHHS] says Calhoun, Muskegon, Grand Traverse, and Wayne counties have reported chickenpox outbreaks in recent weeks. The cases have mainly involved unvaccinated children in school settings.

Health officials say the virus was severe enough that several children were hospitalized.

The varicella virus, commonly known as chickenpox is caused by a virus in the herpes family. The itchy, blistery rash that is the hallmark of chickenpox may be accompanied by fever, fatigue, headache, and loss of appetite. Chickenpox is highly contagious. The virus is spread through coughing, sneezing, and contaminated surfaces.

According to the MDHHS, before the chickenpox vaccine became widely utilized, an estimated 4 million Americans contracted chickenpox each year. About 100 of those people died each year.

"Since the introduction of the chickenpox vaccine 20 years ago, the immunization has greatly reduced the incidence of illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths related to the disease. Michigan has seen a 97 percent decline in chickenpox in that time," said Dr Eden Wells in a news release from the MDHHS. "The best thing you can do to protect your loved ones and community against chickenpox is to make sure your family is immunized."

It's been a longtime practice among parents who believe in natural immunizations. Chickenpox parties are popular with families who want their children to catch the disease, rather than be vaccinated. However, a visit to a Plano mom's home by Child Protective Services [CPS] this week [week of 7 Dec 2015] has triggered worries within the community that authorities may be prosecuting them as bad parents.

The mom said that CPS knocked on her door this week because she was hosting a chickenpox party for kids whose parents are opposed to vaccinations. Parents who support the practice stated that they are being bullied online by people who report them to the police.

A mother from Plano moderates a private Facebook page for more than 300 parents who believe that it is safer for children to get the chickenpox than it is for them to be vaccinated against it. She explained, "When one child has chickenpox, we promote playdates throughout."

The mother can handle the critics, who have their own page mocking her beliefs, but she said that recently they have gone too far.

An overseas Facebook group is devoted to publicly shaming anti-vaccine parents, She stated. They reported one of her friends to CPS in Collin County, who sent a caseworker to her front door. "What is shocking to me about that is there hasn't been a law broken," said the woman. "Chickenpox parties are not considered dangerous. They're not illegal."

But criminal law attorney Pete Schulte explained how a parent could be prosecuted. "If a child is introduced to the chickenpox and becomes seriously ill, or dies, then the parents could face criminal liability out of the penal code," he said.

The mother who was questioned by CPS refused to speak, but the incident has spread fear among the anti-vaccine community. "I feel bullied and victimized," she said. "I'd like for my parental rights to be respected. I didn't break the law. My children are well cared for and it is my choice."

CPS would not say anything about the case, or even whether an investigation was going on, citing its strict privacy policy.

This publication from 2011 clearly shows the dramatic decrease in deaths from varicella in the USA following introduction of the pediatric varicella vaccine:

Marin M, Zhang JX, Seward JF: Near elimination of varicella deaths in the US after implementation of the vaccination program. Pediatrics. 2011; 128(2): 214-20; available at http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/128/2/214.long.

"Abstract
---------
Objective: Varicella has been preventable by vaccination in the United States since 1995. Previous studies reported a 66 percent decline in mortality rate during the 1st 6 years of the program. Since then, vaccination coverage has increased substantially. We updated the analysis of US varicella mortality for 2002-2007 and assessed the impact of the 1st 12 years of the US varicella vaccination program on varicella deaths.

Methods: National data on deaths for which varicella was listed as an underlying or contributing cause were obtained from the Mortality Multiple Cause-of-Death records from the US National Center for Health Statistics. We calculated the age-adjusted and age-specific mortality rates for 2002-2007 and trends since the prevaccine years.

Results: During the 12 years of the mostly 1-dose US varicella vaccination program, the annual average mortality rate for varicella listed as the underlying cause declined 88 percent, from 0.41 per million population in 1990-1994 to 0.05 per million population in 2005-2007. The decline occurred in all age groups, and there was an extremely high reduction among children and adolescents younger than 20 years (97 percent) and among subjects younger than 50 years overall (96 percent). In the last 6 years analyzed (2002-2007), a total of 3 deaths per age range were reported among children aged 1 to 4 and 5 to 9 years, compared with an annual average of 13 and 16 deaths, respectively, during the prevaccine years.

Conclusions: The impressive decline in varicella deaths can be directly attributed to successful implementation of the 1-dose vaccination program. With the current 2-dose program, there is potential that these most severe outcomes of a vaccine-preventable disease could be eliminated."

Chickenpox parties were actually quite common in the pre-vaccine era with the rationale being that acquiring the infection in childhood gives a substantially lower morbidity and mortality rate than in adolescents or adults. With the advent of the varicella vaccine age, such practices done instead of vaccination represent another example of unwisdom in parallel to most anti-vaccination efforts. - Mod.LL]
