Public health officials in a Spanish region have reported 6 confirmed _Salmonella_ infections. Surveys and epidemiological work by [Castile and Leon] Public Health have shown the outbreak could have been caused by the consumption of tortillas in 2 establishments in Soria. A Spanish tortilla also called a Spanish omelette can contain herbs, spices, potatoes, and eggs. The product was cooked at one of these sites and part of it was transferred, once prepared, to the second.

Two children and 4 adults are affected. The 2 young people went to the Santa Bárbara Hospital and were then transferred to Burgos University Hospital, where they were admitted to the pediatric Intensive Care Unit (ICU). 2 women and 2 men between 31 and 51 years old are also sick. All of them needed hospital treatment. One person is in ICU and the other 3 appear to be recovering.

The Public Health Veterinary Services is carrying out inspections to verify the hygienic and sanitary conditions in which the items consumed by these patients were produced and the way in which they were transferred to the 2nd establishment.

Meanwhile, food poisoning cases more than halved in Andalucía in 2020 with the drop attributed to measures put in place due to the coronavirus pandemic. Figures come from La Consejeria de Salud y Familias (Ministry of Health and Families) which published the epidemiological surveillance of foodborne diseases in 2020. Officials said the influence that the COVID-19 pandemic had on the annual evaluation of foodborne infections was "very clearly and directly demonstrated" due to mask-wearing, restrictions on the population, less travel, frequent handwashing, and closure of food premises. The number of outbreaks in 2019 was 248 while the figure in 2020 was 101. In total, 3585 people were affected in 2019 compared to 829 patients in 2020. Salmonellosis continued to be the most common causative agent in outbreaks followed by norovirus.

The seasonal pattern in 2020 also showed a significant variation in previous years. A decrease was seen in April and May, and the highest number occurred in June to August. Past years saw an upward trend until October but it decreased in 2020. However, there was a noticeable rise in December, possibly coinciding with the easing of COVID-19 measures. Based on data on the place of preparation of the contaminated food vehicle; 22 outbreaks each were linked to private homes and restaurants followed by bars and cafeterias. Confirmed and suspected foods most frequently linked to outbreaks included eggs and food made from egg products, fish, shellfish, and bivalve mollusks, meat and meat products, and sauces. Factors contributing to incidents included preservation of food at room temperature, food preparation too far in advance, poor cleaning of kitchen utensils, cross-contamination in the kitchen, insufficient refrigeration of food, or infected food handlers.

[With salmonellosis as the illness, the ingredient in the Spanish tortilla likely to be the source of this enteric pathogen is the eggs. Salmonellosis, often with serotype Enteritidis, is thought to be associated with cracked eggs or eggs dirty with fecal matter, a problem controlled by cleaning procedures implemented in the egg industry. It is clearly the case, however, that most of the salmonellosis outbreaks linked to eggs were associated with uncracked, disinfected grade A eggs, or foods containing such eggs. The undamaged eggs become contaminated during ovulation and thus were contaminated with the bacteria before the eggshell was formed. To avoid this, uncooked eggs should only be used as an ingredient, if pasteurized. Whether the transmission was related to undercooked eggs or issues with kitchen hygiene is unclear.

Spanish omelette or Spanish tortilla (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_omelette) "is a traditional dish from Spain and one of the signature dishes in Spanish cuisine. It is an omelette made with eggs and potatoes, optionally including onion. It is often served at room temperature as a tapa. It is commonly known in Spanish-speaking countries as "tortilla de patatas, tortilla de papas, or tortilla española." The word tortilla, in European Spanish as well as in some variants of Latin American Spanish, means omelette. As such, a potato omelette is a tortilla de patatas or papas.

As the dish has gained international popularity, and perhaps to avoid being confused with the thin flatbread made out of wheat or maize popular in parts of Latin America such as Mexico and Central America, the espanola or Spanish naming gained traction. As such, Spanish omelette or Spanish tortilla are its common names in English, while tortilla espanola is a formally accepted name even within the peninsula. In Spain, omelette (made of beaten eggs fried with olive oil) is conversely known as tortilla francesa ('French omelette'). Tortilla is the diminutive form of torta, meaning 'small pancake'.

A particularly runny "Betanzos" omelette is popular in Galicia and Madrid. They are normally elaborated without onion and rely heavily on the careful cooking of the potato [perhaps a runny form was the issue here].

The most common procedure to cook a Spanish omelette is as follows:
- The potatoes, ideally a starchy variety, are cut into thin slices or small dice.
- They are then seasoned and sautéed in vegetable oil, traditionally olive oil, with sliced onions being added at this stage if used. These ingredients are stirred at a moderate temperature until they are soft but not brown.
- The potatoes (and onions, if included) are then removed, drained, and mixed with whisked eggs.
- This mixture is then returned to the pan and slowly cooked, turning the omelette to cook both sides.
- Once the eggs are cooked on one side, a plate is placed over the mixture so the pan can be inverted.
- The mixture is then slipped back into the pan to cook the other side"
