GeoSentinel, the global surveillance program of the International
Society of Travel Medicine, has been informed by our sites and
collaborators that here have been 2 deaths in the past 5 days.
Both were in foreign citizens usually resident in Haiti not taking
any malaria chemoprophylaxis. Both had spent the weekend of 17 Oct
2005 in the Cote des Arcadins area on the gulf side of the island.
Slide diagnosis of one case has been confirmed in Canada, where one
patient died after becoming ill while visiting there. CDC in the US
is providing technical assistance with the specimens in the 2nd case,
which had been slide-diagnosed after evacuation to a US hospital.
Both patients had rapidly fulminant disease with DIC very consistent
with malaria, but this naturally raised the concern about other
etiologies in the expatriate community in Haiti. Falciparum malaria
is known to be endemic in Haiti, and these cases serve as a reminder
of the perils of forgoing malaria prophylaxis.

[Malaria remains a major problem in Haiti, though fortunately
chloroquine resistance has not yet been a significant issue. These
cases of presumed _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria, one fatal, are a
reminder for the need for chemoprophylaxis and for continued efforts
toward vaccine development and eventually, eradication. - Mod.LM]
