In a state-run hospital near Bangladesh's border with India, [SI] prays his father does not become one of the facility's more than 300 patients who have died this month [June 2021] from the coronavirus.

Hundreds like his father are struggling to breathe in the COVID-19 treatment unit, while [SI] waits in an emergency room packed with people. Relatives rush in and out, desperately trying to find oxygen cylinders for their loved ones.

The crowds of COVID-19 patients and their worried families are new scenes for the 1200-bed Rajshahi Medical College Hospital, which serves border communities being overrun by the more infectious Delta variant first detected in neighbouring India.

More than 450 people with COVID-19 were admitted on Tuesday [29 Jun 2021] to the state-run hospital in Rajshahi district's main city.

[SI] said his entire family has been shunned by people in his home village closer to the border.

"The other villagers are afraid of us. They don't talk to us. When they see us on the road, they take a different path," he said. "We are suffering a lot."

Rising infections and crowded hospitals are being seen across Bangladesh, where a stringent lockdown starts on Thursday [1 Jul 2021].

The government will deploy military soldiers, paramilitary border officers, and riot police to enforce the lockdown, set initially for one week.

Meanwhile, the United States on Tuesday [29 Jun 2021] began shipping 2.5 million doses of Moderna's COVID vaccine to the South Asian nation of more than 160 million people, a White House official told AFP news agency.

Bangladesh "has a 55% week-over-week increase in cases, driven largely by the Delta variant," the official said, explaining how the country made it onto the urgent list. The delivery is expected to be completed this week.

Authorities in Bangladesh warn that the rapid surge in border areas is accelerating the virus's spread further into Bangladesh. Hospitals in the cities of Khulna and Rajshahi are overwhelmed.

"If people do not maintain health safety rules and if they do not stay at home, this wave of the pandemic in Bangladesh could be catastrophic. It spreads fast and it kills more people," said ASM Alamgir, a chief scientific officer of the government's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research in the capital, Dhaka.

Many border districts in northern and southwestern Bangladesh were spared from COVID-19 until now, so people lack antibodies against the virus. That, combined with the large numbers of unvaccinated people, makes the population much more vulnerable.

Just over 4 million people are fully immunised. Another 1.5 million have received one dose, but the shortage of Oxford-AstraZeneca imports, halted by India, have left them uncertain when they will get their 2nd dose.

The Rajshahi hospital is also short of the type of oxygen supply system necessary for critical patients at a time when it is seeing more and more patients with worryingly low oxygen levels.

High-flow nasal cannulas deliver steady continuous oxygen to such patients, but government hospitals in border districts have been forced to rely on portable oxygen cylinders instead.

"They can't be managed properly with just oxygen cylinders. If we can't provide them with central oxygen line, God forbid, the casualties may increase," said Brigadier General Shamim Yazdani, director of the hospital.

The South Asian nation has confirmed more than 900 000 cases in total, including at least 14 300 deaths since March last year [2020]. Experts say the actual figures could be higher.

On Monday [28 Jun 2021], daily infections touched a record 8364, almost double from last week, according to the health ministry. Sunday [27 Jun 2021] saw its highest reported deaths of the pandemic, 119, while another 112 people died on Tuesday [29 Jun 2021].

Experts are bracing for the situation to further worsen in the coming weeks.

The surging cases and vaccine uncertainties have pushed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government to double down with restrictions. The curbs began in phases on Monday [28 Jun 2021] before all economic activity will be halted in a stringent nationwide lockdown starting on Thursday [1 Jul 2021].

In anticipation, thousands of people have attempted to flee Dhaka since last weekend, crowding bus and ferry terminals while flouting public health measures like maintaining social distancing.

A complete lockdown may be the only answer to slow the variant, which poses the biggest risk yet. "If we can enforce the strict shutdown as planned, we will be able to avoid a disaster," said Alamgir. "Let's hope for the best."

["Bangladesh will return to national lockdown by the end of the week, responding to a wave of infections that on Monday [28 Jun 2021] brought its highest single-day death toll of the pandemic so far.

"The looming restrictions, imposed in a series of steps, have sent tens of thousands of migrant laborers in Dhaka, the capital and largest city, scrambling to get to their villages in scenes reminiscent of neighboring India's migrant exodus last year [2020].

"The garment industry, which employs 4.5 million people and makes up 80% of the country's exports, will remain open. But other businesses were instructed to limit their operations to minimum levels of required staffing, and almost all public transportation systems are either closing or already closed."
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/world/asia/bangladesh-lockdown.html

Bangladesh also shut the border with India on 26 Apr [2021]. However, the border is porous. Adherence to the public health recommendations, including masks and social distancing, has been poor. No wonder that Delta is spreading fast. Here is a glimpse of the situation on the 2nd day of "limited" lockdown on Tue 29 Jun 2021 from Sharifa Nasreen (ProMED-SoAs's Mod.SN), University of Toronto: https://bdnews24.com/media-en/2021/06/30/second-day-of-limited-lockdown-curbs. - Mod.LK]

[2] Mucormycosis, India
Date: Mon 28 Jun 2021
Source: The New Indian Express [edited]
https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2021/jun/28/over-40000-black-fungus-cases-reported-in-india-so-far-harsh-vardhan-2322625.html

The country has reported 40 845 cases of mucormycosis, or black fungus, during the COVID 2nd wave so far, nearly 85% of which have been seen in coronavirus patients while the fungal disease has already claimed 3129 lives. These figures were shared by Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan in a meeting of the group of ministers on COVID on Monday [28 Jun 2021].

Mucormycosis, a rare fungal disease that has reached epidemic proportions over the last few days, is said to be fuelled by the use of steroids, compromised immunity, and diabetes in COVID patients. The disease has caught attention, as it has a high mortality rate and manifests itself severely through stark symptoms on the face, lungs, and brain and often requires complicated surgeries.

The data presented in the Monday [28 Jun 2021] meeting showed that while 34 940 patients, or 85.5% of the total diagnosed with black fungus, had COVID, 26 187, or about 64.11%, were co-morbid for diabetes. Also, 31 444 [70%] of the cases were rhino-orbital in nature, meaning the patients had infection in and around the nasal cavity [and orbit of the eye].

However, only about 21 523 (52.69%) of those infected were on steroids, and the disease distribution age group-wise showed that it struck the highest number of people in the 45-60-year age group, but even younger ones were not spared. For instance, 13 083 patients were in the age group 18-45 (32%), 17 464 were in the age group 45-60 (42%), while 10 082 (24%) patients were 60+ years of age.

[In ProMED's COVID-19 update (198): MCT, mucormycosis, Europe variant origin, WHO 20210607.8430676, mucormycosis was thought to be associated with increased use of steroids in COVID patients. "Experts also suggest that the indiscriminate use of steroids for some COVID treatments could be linked to mucormycosis or other fungal infections. Two widely prescribed steroids -- dexamethasone and methylprednisolone -- are used for COVID patients in India to reduce the inflammation caused by the body's immune response. However, with hospitals and doctors overwhelmed by a growing numbers of cases, there's evidence that these steroids are being taken without medical supervision."

"Mucormycosis spores are found in soil, air, and even in food, said the AIIMS [All India Institute of Medical Sciences] chief. In a new advisory over black fungus infection, the central government asked people to be extra careful regarding infection protocols since the mucormycosis fungus enters the body through a cut, scrape, burn, or other types of skin trauma when the skin comes in contact with fungal spores in the environment" (see https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/misuse-of-steroids-major-cause-behind-mucormycosis-infection-aiims-chief-101621078067509.html). - Mod.LK]

[Not all of these cases of mucormycosis are associated with COVID-19 infection or its treatment, so this report is the subject of a separate ProMED post as well.

[3] Research: immune response

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Although 2-dose mRNA vaccination provides excellent protection against SARS-CoV-2, data are scarce on vaccine efficacy against variants of concern (VOC) in individuals above 80 years of age. Here we analysed immune responses following vaccination with mRNA vaccine BNT162b22 in elderly participants and younger health-care workers. Serum neutralisation and binding IgG/IgA after the 1st vaccine dose diminished with increasing age, with a marked drop in participants over 80 years old. Sera from participants above 80 showed significantly lower neutralisation potency against B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1. variants of concern as compared to wild type and were more likely to lack any neutralisation against VOC following the 1st dose.

However, following the 2nd dose, neutralisation against VOC was detectable regardless of age. Frequency of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific B-memory cells was higher in elderly responders versus non-responders after 1st dose. Elderly participants demonstrated clear reduction in somatic hypermutation of class-switched cells. SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific T cell IFN-gamma and IL-2 responses decreased with increasing age, and both cytokines were secreted primarily by CD4 T cells. We conclude that the elderly are a high-risk population that warrant specific measures to boost vaccine responses, particularly where variants of concern are circulating."

Discussion
Critically, we show that elderly individuals are likely at greater risk from VOC, as a greater proportion of individuals in the over-80 age group lost all neutralising activity to P.1 and B.1.1.7 following 1st dose as compared to the wild type. Reassuringly, we observed neutralising responses across all age groups after the 2nd dose, although further work is needed to understand the impact of age on durability of immune responses following vaccination.
