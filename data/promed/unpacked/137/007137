The state [Assam] health department, which has a Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccination programme, suffered a major embarrassment after 5 of the 175 JE-positive cases in the state were found to have been previously vaccinated.

As the state continued to reel from JE, district health officials said vaccination cannot provide foolproof protection, as a lot of factors like immunity, nutrition level, body mechanism and surroundings, dictate the performance of the vaccines.

All the 5 affected persons were within the age bracket that is considered to be eligible for the SA 14-14-2 vaccine. The vaccine is administered to people between 1-65 years of age.

The 5 cases were reported from Dhemaji, Dibrugarh, Golaghat and Tinsukia districts. Tinsukia reported 2 cases: a 9-year-old girl from the tea garden community and a 54-year-old man.

In March [2015], the state government launched the vaccination programme for kids in 11 districts and that for adults in 3 districts. Tinsukia district joint director of health Jyoti Bhuyan said the 9-year-old girl from the tea garden community was vaccinated earlier as part of the district's routine immunization programme, but her surroundings were unhygienic, and she was not properly nourished.

"Even after being vaccinated, there are chances that a person might fall ill. When we investigated the girl's case, we found that there were pigs in the area where she was staying," said Bhuyan.

Tinsukia district reported 7 cases of JE. No casualty has been reported so far. The 54-year-old man was administered the vaccine during the 1st phase of the adult vaccination programme last year [2014].

"The immunity cannot be 100 percent. There remains a chance of infection. Vaccination performance depends on the body mechanism of the recipient along with one's standard of living and exposure to the environment," said Aboni Borthakur, joint director health, Golaghat.

Meanwhile, the virus has claimed 4 lives in Hailakandi district. All of them died at Silchar Medical College Hospital (SMCH) in the past one week, said a senior officer of the district malaria department in Hailakandi on [Wed 15 Jul 2015]. He said 7 more are battling for their lives.

District programme manager of the malaria department Ujjwal Barbhuiyan said the department distributed medicated [insecticide impregnated bed] nets in the district.

[2] Vaccine-resistant strain suspected

State [Assam] health officials fear that a possible new vaccine-resistant strain of Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus, which may have gained virulence, could be the cause of the outbreak of the vector-borne disease in areas covered by vaccination drives.

The highest number of JE positive cases this year [2015] has been reported from Sivasagar district, which was the 1st district in the state where the adult vaccination campaign was launched in 2012.

Sivasagar district joint director of health services Ripun Borpujari said: "This could be a new JE strain, and the virus may have developed resistance to the vaccine. We have intensified awareness and fogging programmes in an effort to combat the JE scourge."

He added that the health department also planned to conduct a survey to study the fever cases. "We are planning a door-to-door survey to study the fever cases. The positive JE cases are fewer compared to last year [2014]. It could be that this is the new JE strain that we are encountering, and it is possible that the virus has gained more virulence," said Borpujari.

More than 200 JE positive cases are being treated at different hospitals across the state. Till [Sat 18 Jul 2015], 38 persons have died, with the highest number of deaths reported from Sivasagar district.

In 2014, Sivasagar district had reported 128 positive cases, and, with the peak season for JE set to continue for 2 more months, Sivasagar district remains vulnerable. This year [2015] so far, 24 confirmed cases have been reported from the district. 14 acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases have also been reported.

Experts also fear that with its sprawling paddy fields and large pig population in the oil-rich Sivasagar district, there could be further positive and confirmed JE cases across the district.

[According to the 1st news report, Japanese encephalitis (JE) developed among 5 people who were vaccinated with SA 14-14-2 vaccine. Among them, a 9-year-old girl was malnourished and had exposure to pigs at her home. The local health officials have stated that the vaccine does not confer 100 percent immunity and that various environmental and host factors, including nutritional status, affect the level of immune response following vaccination. Of note, SA 14-14-2 vaccine is a live-attenuated vaccine using the SA 14-14-2 JE virus strain. Vaccine efficacy following a single-dose of vaccine has been reported to vary between 80 to 99.3 percent from different studies (http://www.path.org/publications/files/SA14142-fact-sheet-1013.pdf). The vaccine has been shown to confer immunity for up to 5 years with 96.2 percent efficacy.

According to the 2nd news report, 38 JE deaths have been reported from the state of Assam as of 18 Jul 2015. The state health officials suspect that a new vaccine-resistant strain of JE virus has become virulent and is causing outbreaks among the vaccinated people in the state. However, it is not clear whether the suspicion is based on virus isolation and sequencing from cases. Since the vaccine does not confer 100 percent immunity, the residents in the affected areas need to be advised to take personal protective measures against mosquito bites.

[If the vaccine provides 96 per cent immunity, then one might expect vaccine failure in 6 of the 175 JE cases mentioned in the 1st report. There were 5 vaccine failures. Proof of "vaccine-resistant" JE virus or a gain in virulence requires further information and study to answer several critical questions. Has there been a demonstrable change in antigenicity in the field (wild) strains of JE virus that are in circulation? Do the vaccinated individuals have JE virus antibody, and if so, does that antibody neutralize current JE virus field isolates as well as it does the vaccine strain of the virus, indicating a change in antigenicity? Is a greater proportion of JE virus-infected individuals developing neurological disease than is typical for JE virus infections indicating an increase in neurovirulence? Changes in virulence would have to be determined in animal studies comparing current fields strains of the virus with standard or reference virus strains. Apparently, not all cases of encephalitis in Assam (and other areas in northeast India) are due to JE virus infections, further complicating the situation. Other etiologies have been suggested as a cause of non-JE virus acute encephalitis syndrome (see ProMED-mail archive nos. 20150225.3183897 and 20140801.2652476), for which JE vaccines would provide no protection. - Mod.TY]
