Outbreak update - Cholera in Somalia, 28 Apr 2019
-------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health (MoH) of Somalia has announced 36 new suspected cases of cholera, with no deaths, for epidemiological week 17 (22 to 28 Apr 2019) in 2019. No cases were reported between epidemiological weeks 1 and 7 due to closure of the main cholera treatment center, from which data is collected. MoH has reported 7140 cases and 46 deaths since the beginning of this outbreak in December 2017.

During the reporting period, cases occurred in 11 out of 17 districts in Banadir region, the worst affected district are Hodan (728), Daynile (613), and Madina (595), and 66.66% of the cases (24) are children below 5 years of age.

WHO, MoH, and partners have contained the cholera outbreak in the districts of Jubaland, Hirshabelle, and South West states following implementation of oral cholera vaccination (OCV) campaigns and other health interventions. However, active transmission is ongoing in 11 districts in Banadir -- Darkenly, Daynile, Hodan, Madina, Hamarjabjab, Howlwadag, Bondere, Kahda, Kaaran, Waberi, and Warta nabada).

In 2019, 114 stool samples have been collected and tested in the National Public Health Laboratory in Mogadishu. During this reporting period, 10 cases were confirmed for _Vibrio cholerae_, serotype O1 Ogawa by culture.

WHO continues to provide leadership and support to health authorities and partners for outbreak mitigating measures. For disease surveillance, WHO supports the electronic Early Warning Alert and Response Network (eEWARN) system which is currently expanding to include all health facilities in Somalia. WHO and MoH continue to monitor outbreak trends via eEWARN, promptly investigating and responding to all alerts.

The Ministry of Health has issued a statement suggesting that 69 people have died nationwide due to cholera in 2019. On a positive note, Bulawayo is reported to have recorded zero casualties. The statement further notes that more than 10 400 cases of the disease were reported during the period January to April 2019. Resultantly, the Ministry of Health embarked on a nationwide cholera vaccine program targeting over one million people. The ministry said "No suspected cases of cholera and deaths were reported during the week ending 14 Apr 2019.This brings the total number of deaths to 69 out of 10 421 cases reported so far in 2019.

In a telephone interview last week[week of 29 Apr 2019], the Director of Epidemiology & Disease Control, Dr Portia Manangazira said that the Ministry was working to curb the cholera epidemic. She revealed that the vaccination program in Manicaland has just been completed while the mass vaccination program for cholera in Harare, Epworth, and Chitungwiza was already yielding results.

[3] Cholera - Mozambique (northern)

Provincial authorities said Fri 3 May 2019 that 14 cholera cases have been confirmed in northern Mozambique following floods caused by a powerful cyclone that battered the country last week. The city of Pemba registered 11 cases of the disease while the neighboring district of Mecufi had 3.

"We were already prepared for that -- the healthcare sector has been on the alert since Cyclone Kenneth started," the provincial health director, Anastacia Lidimo, told reporters.

Cyclone Kenneth made landfall in northern Cabo Delgado province on 25 Apr 2019, packing winds up to 220 kilometres (137 miles) per hour -- hitting a region that has not experienced a tropical cyclone in the modern era.

According to the UN humanitarian agency OCHA, Pemba, a city of 200 000 people and the capital of Cabo Delgado province, is in one of the most cholera-endemic regions in Mozambique. In Beira, the impoverished and aid-dependent country administered nearly 900 000 doses of oral cholera vaccines after Cyclone Idai [4-9 Mar 2019] to avert an epidemic.

One person has died while at least 188 have been treated for cholera in Kotulo, Mandera South, in the past month, the county's public health chief officer has said. The chief officer, Ms Rahama Abdullahi, said the person died due to delayed treatment.

"Since 6 Apr 2019, we have had one death that occurred upon late arrival at the treatment center. We currently have 9 patients at the facility, but they are all stable," Ms Abdullahi said, adding the situation was under control as various actions had been taken. "We set up a cholera treatment center with 50 beds. The situation has improved tremendously," she said, adding water sources were treated, homes disinfected, and public sanitation services offered.

"We have treated the 2 major water sources for the 10 villages at Kotulo and all our officers in other sub-counties are alert." Ms Abdullahi further said the public were being educated on the disease and that fast food kiosks in the area that borders Wajir county had been closed.

"We have also taken steps to avert a possible crisis at 3 schools in the area," she said.

To prevent the spread of the disease to other areas, all vehicles passing through Kotulo to Elwak or Wajir were also disinfected. "We are not taking chances. We have positioned our teams and sent supplies across the county to avert a crisis," the officer said.

According to the chief officer, the index case was of a woman who had travelled from Nairobi, where an outbreak had been declared. "The situation in Mandera is under control at the moment," she said. "We are managing the situation with some assistance from Kenya Red Cross at the treatment center."

Mandera last experienced a cholera outbreak in 2016, when 1629 cases and 18 deaths were recorded.

[6] Cholera - Nepal (Kathmandu)

Cholera has been detected in a patient who was admitted to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital in Teku for treatment of diarrhoeal disease. The 45-year-old man from Tanchal, Kathmandu, was taken to the hospital after he continually suffered from loose bowel movements, nausea, vomiting, and headache.

Doctors at the hospital, who attended the patient, had his stool samples examined in the hospital laboratory, which established that the man was suffering from cholera. The hospital then sent the patient's stool samples to the National Public Health Laboratory for confirmation. The lab report confirmed the disease.

Dr Basudev Pandey, director at the hospital, told the Post, "_Vibrio cholerae_ O1 Ogawa has been confirmed in a patient admitted in our hospital." He said that the hospital has informed the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division under the Department of Health Services about the confirmation of the potentially deadly disease in the diarrhea patient.

Every year, dozens of people get infected with the deadly bacterial disease throughout the country especially during the monsoon season. But, according to Pandey, the establishing of a cholera case before the onset of the monsoon season in the Capital was alarming.

Aggressive interventions to stem outbreaks of cholera include providing sources of clean water and a vaccination campaign. The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017, pp 113-136:

"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2 or 3 dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80 percent for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility.

"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:
- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;
- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65% (95% CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally-produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam;
- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61).

In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use in US travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63, 64).
