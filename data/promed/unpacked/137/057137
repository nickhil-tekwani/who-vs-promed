A single paddock has been quarantined after being linked to a gastrointestinal that put almost 40 people in hospital. Foodstuffs, which owns Pak 'n Save and New World supermarkets, announced today [16 Oct 2014] that the source of the recent _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_ outbreak appeared to be farm-based. The bacterium is uncommon in New Zealand with only 13 cases notified last year [2013], but about 127 people have been affected and 38 hospitalized during last month's [September 2014] outbreak.

"In exploring our own supply chain, should the contamination have come from Pam's Lettuce, we can confirm we have been able to narrow our investigation down to a single paddock from the supplier Living Foods," the company said in a statement. "This paddock has been quarantined at our request and further independent testing has been commissioned alongside the MPI [Ministry of Primary Industries] investigation."

Foodstuffs said all Pams Fresh Express products on shelves now, or those already bought that were not past their best before dates, were safe for consumption. "We do understand the frustration those who have suffered from yersiniosis feel and their desire to get answers quickly as to how they became unwell. To ensure the safety of the food sold to our customers, we remain determined to get to the bottom of the cause of the outbreak, regardless of whether our products were involved or not."

Foodstuffs expected to have the results from its initial supplier audit review early next week, while sample analysis results from an independent laboratory were expected by the end of the month [October 2014]. "We hope our results along with the findings of the MPI investigation will give all parties clarity as to how such an incidence could occur."

A Foodstuffs investigation had excluded Pams bagged carrots as a likely source of contamination because no one supplier of Pams was responsible for distribution across the country where sickness had been reported. MPI deputy director-general Scott Gallacher said the ministry was drawing on the "best available" expertise and information from around the world as it continued to investigate the origins of the outbreak.

Health data showed the contamination event happened in August 2014 and was identified as an outbreak of illness on 23 Sep 2014. There had been no further confirmed cases since the 1st week of October [2014].

Canterbury medical officer of health Alistair Humphrey had criticised MPI's refusal to release the full list of products under investigation, saying the ministry seemed more concerned about the industry than protecting public health.

Gallacher said MPI released 2 reports from ESR [Institute of Environmental and Scientific Research] today [16 Oct 2014] to "stop the speculation" about what foods were being investigated. "It is not a simple situation where we can recall a single product. It is not definitely linked to any one provider, distributor, wholesaler or retailer."

Horticulture New Zealand chief executive Peter Silcock said releasing the reports was "the right thing to do at this time", but statements from Humphrey earlier this week had been "very unhelpful" as they had affected the industry's reputation. "It's targeted parts of the industry quite unfairly. We're keen to obviously get to the bottom of this as well."

Initial information presented by ESR and public health units associated the illness with a range of fresh produce, including lettuce, carrots, tomatoes, apples, cold ready-to-eat meats and dairy products.

ESR's initial report, dated 6 Oct 2014, found those who became ill were more likely to have eaten raw lettuce or carrots, including those bagged and marketed under the Pams brand, than those who were not ill. A 2nd report, dated 8 Oct 2014, said those who purchased lettuce from Foodstuffs supermarkets were 2.33 times as likely to become ill than those who bought from Progressive Enterprises supermarkets (including Countdown and Supervalue), while those who bought lettuce from independent supermarkets were 4.08 times as likely to become ill than those buying from Progressive Enterprises.

"This information is not definitive and should lead to investigation of possible supply or processing in Foodstuffs New Zealand and independent supermarkets," the report said. Investigations into the outbreak were continuing.

[Most individuals affected with _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_ are children or young adults. The most common presentation of this infection is mesenteric lymphadenitis, with fever and right lower quadrant abdominal pain, which can be confused with acute appendicitis. A febrile gastroenteritis may also occur, which has been described as Izumi syndrome in Japan. Late complications may be a reactive arthritis or erythema nodosum.

Although many associations had been previously made, one of the strongest studies of the relationship of _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ and food was published in 2004 from Finland (1). The editorial commentary (2) with the paper is a nicely presented discussion on the hazards of infections associated with fresh produce.

The diagnosis of infection with this bacterium can be made by isolation of the organism from lymph node or stool. Serological tests can be helpful, but cross-reactions are found between yersiniae and other enteric organisms, including some salmonellae.
