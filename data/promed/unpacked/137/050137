Contagious hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) had led to 30 deaths
in China as of Thursday morning [8 May 2008], according to Xinhua's
tally based on confirmed death reports from provincial-level health bureaus.

Two children died of enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection, which caused
them to develop HFMD, in the southernmost Hainan Province, a
provincial health department official said on Thursday [8 May 2008].
He did not say when they had died.

According to the latest figures from the provincial health
department, 180 cases of HFMD were reported by Thursday [8 May 2008],
of which 5 were confirmed to be infected with the EV71 virus.

The central province of Hunan and the southwestern Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region reported their 1st and only HFMD deaths on
Wednesday [7 May 2008].

China has reported 21 502 hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) cases
so far this year by Thursday [8 May 2008], resulting in 30 deaths,
according to a Xinhua tally of local official figures. The figure
stood at 19 962 on Wednesday [7 May 2008], Xinhua found. The rising
number was not a sign of a deteriorating situation but mainly because
of a recent order by the Ministry of Health that made HFMD a class C
epidemic, the incidence of which must be reported.

The eastern Shandong Province reported 1440 HFMD cases on Thursday [8
May 2008]. The southernmost Hainan Province updated the number of
infections to 180, and the northwestern Qinghai Province updated the
number to 10 on Thursday. The Shandong health authority asked the
grassroots hospitals to immediately shift children with fever under 5
years old to bigger hospitals for better treatment.

So far, EV71 is blamed for most of the 30 deaths in the outbreak of
the disease. Of all the victims, 22 were in Anhui, 3 in Guangdong and
2 in Hainan, with the rest in Zhejiang, Guangxi, and Hunan.
