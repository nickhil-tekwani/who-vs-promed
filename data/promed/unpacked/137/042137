Taiwan reports imported measles in unvaccinated child
-----------------------------------------------------
On [Fri 3 Mar 2017], the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC) announced this year's [2017] 1st imported measles case in a 1 year old girl who resides in northern Taiwan and had not received the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine. According to health officials, she traveled to Guangdong, China with her family last October [2016].

On 22 Feb 2017, she developed fever and cough. On 26 Feb 2017, she developed rash. On 28 Feb 2017, she took Flight HX252 to return to Taiwan. Before she boarded the plane, she took a fever reducer. After she arrived at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport at around 11 am, she was driven to a hospital for medical attention by her relative. She was reported to the health authority as a suspected case by the hospital and hospitalized in the isolation ward. On 3 Mar 2017, infection with measles was confirmed in the case after the hospital submitted her specimens for laboratory testing.

During the infectious period [22-28 Feb 2017, the case was in China for most of the time. To prevent further transmission of the disease, the local health authority has implemented a number of prevention measures and identified 144 contacts, including her family members who reside in the same household, passengers (including cabin crew) on the same flight, healthcare personnel, and patients that she came into contact with when she sought medical attention, to monitor and follow up until 18 Mar 2017.

Among the contacts, the case's brother sought medical attention in China after becoming infected with measles in mid-February [2017] and has since recovered. Currently, none of the other contacts has developed suspected symptoms. Individuals who met the criteria are being arranged for administration of immunoglobulin and MMR vaccine.

Last year [2016], a cumulative total of 14 measles cases, including 6 indigenous cases and 8 imported cases, were confirmed.

[In addition to the 144 individuals alerted by the health authorities, everyone in the Hong Kong and Taiwan airports in the vicinity of the flight gates was exposed to measles virus.

AHS [Alberta Health Services] issues public alert over potential exposure to measles
----------------------------------------------------------------
Officials with Alberta Health Services issued an alert [Fri 3 Mar 2017] over a confirmed case of the measles in a person who flew between Vancouver and Edmonton at the end of February [2017]. AHS said an individual had a confirmed case of measles -- and there were 2 potential exposure locations that the public should be aware of.

The 1st potential exposure was on [Fri 24 Feb 2017], on WestJet Flight WS 186 from Vancouver to Edmonton, and anyone on that flight could have been exposed (it departed from Vancouver at 10:20 pm PST). The 2nd potential exposure was on [Sat 25 Feb 2017] at the Edmonton International Airport between 12:30 am and 3:30 am.

Officials said anyone who was in those locations at that time, and who were born after 1970 and haven't had measles or have not received 2 doses of the vaccine may be at risk of developing measles.

AHS is contacting individuals who were on the flight directly [...] Individuals are being asked to monitor themselves for symptoms of measles until [18 Mar 2017].

Symptoms include: a fever of 38.3 deg C [100.4 deg F] or higher, along with a cough, runny nose and/or red eyes, and a red blotchy rash that appears 3-7 days after fever starts, usually beginning behind the ears, and on the face, before spreading down the body, then to arms and legs.

If symptoms develop, individuals are asked to stay home and call Health Link at 811 before visiting any health care facility or provider.

AHS said measles is extremely contagious, and is spread easily through the air -- there is no treatment, but it can be prevented through immunization. The vaccine is typically administered for the 1st time to children at 12 months of age, and their 2nd dose is given between the ages of 4 and 6 years.

Concern over measles, meningococcal cases
-----------------------------------------
A confirmed case of measles on Brisbane's southside last month [February 2017] and a meningococcal case at a childcare centre on Bribie Island has prompted warnings from health authorities.

Queensland Health says a large number of people were potentially exposed when a person infected by measles visited Morningside Tennis Centre, Hampton swim school and Morningside Woolworths late last month.

Romania: Measles outbreak tops 3000, linked to other EU outbreaks
-----------------------------------------------------------------
In a follow-up on the ongoing measles outbreak in Romania, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reports that from September 2016 to 17 Feb 2017 the Romanian National Institute of Public Health received reports of 3071 cases of measles.

Despite efforts to get the outbreak under control (lowered the age for administering the 1st vaccine dose from the usual 12 months to 9 months and recommended that all children up to 9 years of age are vaccinated), the outbreak continues.

To date, 16 deaths have been reported, all of which occurred in persons who were immunocompromised or had other co-morbidities. Cases have been reported in 36 districts.

[The ECDC (European Center for Disease Control and Prevention) reports that between 1 Feb 2016 and 31 Jan 2017, ECDC received reports of 4484 cases of measles from 30 EU/EEA countries. In 2016, measles outbreaks were seen in a number of EU/EEA countries and an increase in the number of cases continues to be observed in 2017. Previous and ongoing measles outbreaks in 3 other EU countries have been epidemiologically-linked to the current outbreak in Romania, however further investigations are needed to gain more insights into the epidemiological links.

Immunisation is the only effective preventive measure against acquiring measles. The latest available data from WHO (from 2015) show that vaccination coverage for measles-containing vaccine was above the 95 per cent target in 17 countries for the 1st dose and 8 countries for the 2nd dose. Given that the vaccination coverage target is still to be reached in a number of EU/EEA countries, the risk of spread and sustained transmission from areas where measles transmission is occurring in areas with susceptible populations is high.

All countries in the EU/EEA have measles vaccination policies in place with 2 doses using an MMR vaccine. Catch-up programmes for individuals having missed vaccination or being too old to have been targeted by routine programmes exist in a number of countries. Strengthening routine immunisation through facilitating access to vaccination, and mechanisms to identify unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated are needed. Promoting and providing additional opportunities for immunisation through a variety of supplemental immunisation activities may be needed in countries with suboptimal vaccination coverage and/or pockets of susceptible populations. (Excerpted from http://bit.ly/2mwDDFr)

However, even with the strong national response to the measles outbreak, a very strong anti-vaccination campaign has been reported in Romania, leading to vaccination rates with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine falling from 95 per cent of children in 2013 to 80 per cent in 2016, and continuing to drop.

------------------------------------------------------------------
[This new opinion paper presents an excellent discussion of the risk to public health posed by those who refuse vaccination of their children, particularly with MMR vaccine. These individuals decrease the level of herd immunity, which would otherwise protect those who are too young to be vaccinated or unable to be vaccinated because of co-morbidities or immunosuppression. Equally importantly, they place themselves at increased risk of severe disease.

Before a measles vaccine became available in 1963, 3-4 million people in the United States were infected with measles each year, resulting in an estimated 48 000 hospitalizations and 400 to 500 deaths (CDC). Measles is still endemic in other countries, which pose a risk through infected travelers even to countries where local transmission of measles has been largely eliminated. Almost all of the measles outbreaks in the developed world reported by ProMED-mail are the consequence of infected individuals from endemic countries introducing the virus into the non-immune subset of largely vaccinated populations. But if the anti-vaccination sentiment builds, larger outbreaks and an increase in serious disease are a distinct possibility.

It is imperative to educate the public to the importance of maintaining a high level of vaccine coverage. This paper makes a strong case and should be shared by pediatricians and schools with parents who refuse vaccination. - Mod.LK]
