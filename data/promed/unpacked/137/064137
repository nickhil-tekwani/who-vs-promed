An anthrax scare gripped Nandol village in Gandhinagar district, with
reports of 23 sheep dying under mysterious conditions on Sunday [31
May 2009]. It was later confirmed that the animals died because of
the deadly disease. The area in Dehgam taluka [administrative
division] has been declared an anthrax prone zone, while no fresh
cases have come to light so far.

The district administration has sent 4 surveillance teams and
launched a vaccination drive since Monday [1 Jun 2009] after
receiving reports of sheep dying in a farm located between Nandol and
Ahmedpur. District development officer Avantika Singh said that all
precautionary measures were being taken to prevent its spread.

Dr BK Patel, deputy director, Animal Husbandry department in
Gandhinagar, said that though no new cases were reported, the
administration had not withdrawn the announcement regarding the area
being an anthrax prone zone.

[Reports of anthrax from Gujurat in western India are infrequent and those
we see are sometimes severe. This would suggest that there is a news
bias to report the most severe and ignore the minor outbreaks, which
may well also apply to the civil authority's awareness and response. -

[No human cases are reported related to this cluster of ovine
infection. Anthrax is endemic in many states in India including Gujarat.

Gandhinagar District is an administrative division of the Indian
state of Gujarat, which is located in the northwestern part of the
country and can be seen on a map at
