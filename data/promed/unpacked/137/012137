Thanks to sensationalized accounts of patients with liquefying flesh and
spouting blood, Ebola virus may well be the most feared disease on the
planet. But the reality of the virus, which strikes humans and other
primates, is grim enough, with patients experiencing sudden onset of fever,
headache, intense weakness, and muscle pain, followed by diarrhea,
vomiting, severe rash, organ failure, and massive hemorrhaging, sometimes
external, within 2 to 21 days of exposure.
The 1st human Ebola outbreaks occurred between 1976 and 1979 in Sudan and
Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo), where 88 percent of the 318
infected persons died -- a typical mortality rate for this strain, called
the Zaire strain of Ebola virus (ZEBOV). It is thought that humans acquired
the virus after handling infected gorilla and chimp carcasses.
Over the past 10 years, separate outbreaks of the deadly Zaire strain have
killed hundreds of humans and tens of thousands of great apes in Gabon and
the Republic of Congo, which harbor roughly 80 percent of the last
remaining wild gorilla and chimpanzee populations. Between 1983 and 2000,
poaching and logging precipitated catastrophic declines in these great
apes, but scientists fear that Ebola may pose an equally deadly threat. Any
efforts to contain the next epidemic depend on understanding the dynamics
of the virus's spread.
In a new study, Peter Walsh et al. combined genetic data with information
on the timing and location of past ZEBOV outbreaks to determine the merits
of 2 competing hypotheses to explain the emergence and spread of the virus.
[see: Wave-Like Spread of Ebola Zaire. By Peter D. Walsh1*, Roman Biek2,

Primatology, Leipzig, Germany, and 2 Department of Biology, Emory
University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America

In the prevailing view, ZEBOV arose from long-persistent local strains
after increased contact between humans or great apes and an unidentified
reservoir host. But Walsh et al. found support for an alternative
hypothesis: that ZEBOV had recently spread to the outbreak regions. This is
good news because a virus that spreads at a predictable rate in a
predictable direction is far easier to control than one that emerges by
chance or at the hands of an unknown trigger.
The authors modeled the virus's spread based on assumptions of a
long-persistent virus versus a recently emerged virus, and tested the
predictions of these competing hypotheses using genetic data -- gathered
from gene sequences taken from human samples at the different outbreak
sites -- and information on the spatiotemporal dynamics of the outbreaks.
Charting the evolutionary relationships of the viral genotypes identified
one major lineage with a most recent common ancestor consistent with the
1976 outbreak. Comparing the path of descent with outbreak localities
mirrored the timing of the outbreaks, with new outbreaks directly
descending from those preceding.
Analyzing the spatiotemporal pattern of outbreaks revealed a spread at the
rate of about 50 kilometers/year -- a predictable path not likely for a
persistent virus -- with the 1st epidemic in Yambuku, then spreading south
to Kikwit and west to Booue, Gabon. Plotting the geographic distribution of
genotypes revealed a clear spatial structure at both local and regional
scales: the genotypes from the 2001-2003 Gabon/Congo outbreaks, for
example, decreased in genetic similarity as distance increased. Again, this
finding is consistent with the recently emerged hypothesis, which predicts
a correlation between genotype and geography at different distances.
Simulations of viral evolution in a spreading epidemic also showed a
consistent spread pattern and a strong correlation between genetic
divergence and spatial separation. Though the authors can't say how the
virus was transmitted, the simulations showed that a "simple nearest
neighbor contact process" could produce the linear, uniform spread rates
found here.
Though the strength of the individual lines of evidence, timing of origin,
spatial spread, and genetic/distance ratio are not conclusive when
considered separately, taken together, they support the hypothesis that a
"consistently moving wave of ZEBOV infection" recently spread to outbreak
sites in Gabon and Congo. Following its current course, ZEBOV may hit
populated areas east of Odzala National Park within 12 years and reach most
parks containing large populations of western gorillas in 3-6 years. 2
Ebola outbreaks have already hit human populations west of Odzala, and over
the past 2 years, the largest gorilla and chimp populations in the world,
found in Odzala, have been devastated, as the disease is spreading to the
last unaffected sector of the park right now.
These findings suggest that strategies to protect villagers and some of the
last remaining wild apes from future outbreaks would do best to concentrate
efforts at the front of the advancing wave -- and start acting now.
