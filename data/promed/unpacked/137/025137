Ebola virus disease - Democratic Republic of the Congo
------------------------------------------------------
On 7 Feb 2021, the Minister of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared [the 12th] outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) after the laboratory confirmation of one case in North Kivu Province. The case was an adult female living in Biena Health Zone. To date the source of infection is still under investigation.

On [25 Jan 2021], the case presented with nasal bleeding. From [25 Jan-1 Feb 2021], she reportedly received outpatient care at a local health centre. From [1-3 Feb 2021], she was admitted to a 2nd health centre with signs of physical weakness, dizziness, joint pain, epigastric pain, liquid stools, headache, and difficulty breathing. On [3 Feb 2021], a blood sample was collected for EVD testing due to her epidemiological link with an EVD survivor. On the same day, she was referred to a hospital in Katwa Health Zone (part of Butembo city) following the deterioration of her condition. She was admitted to the intensive care unit the same day and died on [4 Feb 2021]. On [5 Feb 2021], the body was buried in Musienene Health Zone, however not under safe burial practices.

On [6 Feb 2021], Butembo laboratory confirmed the case positive for EVD by GeneXpert. On [7 Feb 2021], the sample was shipped to Goma laboratory, and tested positive for EVD by GeneXpert on [8 Feb 2021]. Samples were sent to the Institut de Recherche Biomedicale for next generation sequencing in order to determine whether this recent Ebola case is linked to a new spill over event or to a resurgence of the outbreak that affected North Kivu, Ituri and South Kivu Provinces in 2018-2020.

As of [8 Feb 2021], a total of 117 contacts have been identified and are under follow up. Investigations and response activities are ongoing.

Public health response
----------------------
- An urgent meeting was convened on [8 Feb 2021] by the Minister of Health, and a team led by the Provincial Minister of Health of North Kivu was deployed to Butembo to organize immediate response activities;
- investigations are on-going in Katwa, Biena, and Musienene Health Zones to identify the source(s) of transmission, identify contacts and conduct active case finding;
- health facilities that were visited by the case have been disinfected;
- the decommissioned Ebola Treatment Center of Katwa is being assessed for reopening;
- WHO is providing ongoing support to the national authorities through staff present in Butembo territory, by preparing shipment of vaccine doses to Butembo and supporting shipment of cold chain equipment to Butembo territory;
- WHO and national authorities are strengthening laboratory capacities by ensuring availability of GeneXpert cartridges at Butembo laboratory; and
- WHO is supporting local authorities to implement immediate actions including case investigation, case finding, contact listing and follow-up.

There are currently therapeutics (Regeneron and mAb114) available for up to 400 patients in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
Preliminary information indicates that the patient visited at least 3 health facilities in 2 health zones and was unsafely buried in a 3rd health zone. There is therefore a risk of EVD spreading to other health zones. WHO is closely monitoring the situation and the risk assessment will be updated as more information becomes available.

The resurgence is not unexpected given that EVD is endemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and that Ebola virus is present in animal reservoirs in the region. The risk of re-emergence through exposure to animal hosts or bodily fluids of Ebola survivors cannot be excluded. In addition, it is not unusual for sporadic cases to occur following a major outbreak.

There are a number of ongoing challenges for surveillance, including access to affected areas and community mistrust toward authorities and outbreak responders. Other health emergencies such as coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), cholera, and measles outbreaks may jeopardize the country's ability to rapidly detect and respond to re-emergence of EVD cases.

WHO advice
----------
WHO advises the following risk reduction measures as an effective way to reduce EVD transmission in humans:
- Continue to train and retrain the health workforce for early detection, isolation and treatment of EVD cases;
- prepare for vaccination of health workers;
- engage with communities to reinforce safe and dignified burial practices; and
- ensure availability of personal protective equipment and infection prevention and control supplies to manage ill patients and for decontamination.

To reduce the risk of wildlife-to-human transmission, such as through contact with fruit bats, monkeys and apes:
- Handle wildlife with gloves and other appropriate protective clothing; and
- cook animal products (blood and meat) thoroughly before consumption and avoid consumption of raw meat from wild animals.

To reduce the risk of human-to-human transmission from direct or close contact with people with EVD symptoms, particularly with their bodily fluids:
- Wear gloves and appropriate personal protective equipment when taking care of ill patients at home; and
- wash hands regularly after visiting patients in hospital, as well as after taking care of patients at home or touching or coming into contact with any body fluids.

To reduce the risk of possible transmission from virus persistence in some body fluids of survivors, WHO recommends providing medical care, psychological support, and biological testing (until 2 consecutive negative tests) through an EVD survivors care programme. WHO does not recommend isolation of male or female convalescent patients whose blood has been tested negative for Ebola virus.

[2] 1st case: transmission source
Date: Wed 10 Feb 2021 6:58 PM GMT+1
Source: The Washington Post [edited]
https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/ebola-semen-congo/2021/02/10/55f04a74-6ba7-11eb-a66e-e27046e9e898_story.html


A woman who died from the Ebola virus in eastern Congo on [3 Feb 2021] was "almost certainly" infected by her husband, who survived an outbreak that ended in June [2020], according to the World Health Organization's emergency response coordinator in Africa.

The country's health ministry is expected to release test results by the weekend [13-14 Feb 2021] confirming the link. If proved, the case would be further evidence that Ebola, which is transmitted via bodily fluids, can live in semen for many months, if not years, while remaining deadly.

"The evidence has grown over the years that the virus can be found in semen beyond 3, to even 9 months, or even 2 years in some cases," said Ngoy Nsenga, the WHO official. "Part of our counseling of survivors is to teach them that sexual activity does carry a risk of transmission, and even to conduct testing on their semen to ascertain whether they are free of the virus."

Studies conducted after the world's worst Ebola outbreak, which spread widely across Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone between 2014 and 2016 and killed more than 11 000, gave early indications that the Ebola virus could remain active in various bodily fluids besides blood, which is the most common vector for its transmission.

The deceased woman's husband was discharged from an Ebola treatment center in the city of Butembo less than a year ago. Regardless of whether the new case is found to be linked to the last outbreak, officials will consider this to be a new outbreak, the 12th in Congo since Ebola was discovered in 1976.

"Technically, because transmission can start anew from this case, it will be considered its own outbreak," said Eta Ngole, deputy programs director for the International Medical Corps, who spoke by phone from Butembo, a city of nearly 1 million people that was the epicenter of the previous outbreak. It is also where the woman with Ebola died last week.

Ngole said the husband's semen had tested negative for Ebola after he was discharged from the treatment center but that Ngole's organization did not do the testing and that tests have in the past returned false negatives. He said only the samples being studied by Congo's health ministry would be able to definitively prove the link between the husband's illness and his wife's.

In past cases, Ebola has been found months later in survivors' eye fluids, Ngole said, and the same was true for vaginal fluids, but it appears to remain the longest in semen, according to Nsenga.

The previous outbreak ravaged eastern Congo's North Kivu and Ituri provinces for nearly 2 years, killing around 2300 and compounding stresses on a region beset by decades of conflict over resources and ethnic rivalries.

The challenges led the Ebola treatment center in Butembo, where the deceased woman's husband was discharged last year [2020], to fall into disrepair.

Ngole and other 1st responders are part of a team rehabilitating the center. "The tents are now in poor shape and can't be used to isolate cases, so we are hoping that this time we can rebuild with semi-permanent material," he said.

Nsenga said Congo's health ministry was leading an effort to trace around 70 contacts of the deceased woman. Concerns about spread are lessened this time around, he said, because many in and around Butembo were vaccinated during the last outbreak there. 2 highly effective Ebola vaccines were approved and distributed over the past year.

"The patient had been handled at several health facilities and was transported by motorbike," he said. "But maybe some of those contacts may have been vaccinated. Just under 304 000 were vaccinated over course of last outbreak."

Approximately 8000 doses of the vaccine were in Congo at the moment, Nsenga said. Some 2000 were in Equateur province, where another outbreak was recently declared over, and 6000 were in the capital, Kinshasa. Nsenga said they were being shipped to Butembo as soon as Wednesday [10 Feb 2021].

[These Ebola cases are being considered the 12th outbreak of Ebola because the virus has the potential to spread and grow into an outbreak. The sequencing results from the 1st case apparently will become available this weekend (13-14 Feb 2021). This will inform whether it is a new outbreak or a continuation of the 11th outbreak. If it appears to be a continuation, it may not be clear whether the woman became infected from her husband, a survivor (because a positive sample was not recovered from his semen), or from an outside source. The occurrence of occasional cases after an outbreak is not unusual. Ebola was active from 2018-2020 in eastern DRC, killing more than 2200 people before it was declared ended in June 2020. Ebola virus is enzootic in equatorial Africa from which it spills over to humans causing periodic outbreaks. - Mod.LK]

[3] 2nd fatal case
- Thu 11 Feb 2021. 2nd fatal Ebola case reported in DRC resurgence
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) News; abridged, edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/02/news-scan-feb-11-2021

A 2nd fatal Ebola case was reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), in a person from North Kivu province, where the 1st case was recently reported in the wife of an Ebola survivor, according to media reports that cited a joint statement from the DRC and the World Health Organization (WHO).

African media reports said the 2nd case involves a 60-year-old woman from Lubero in North Kivu province, who had contact with the 1st case.

Also, the WHO yesterday [10 Feb 2021] posted new details about the 1st patient, whose illness resulted in high-risk exposures. The 42-year-old woman sought care for nasal bleeding on [25 Jan 2021] and was referred to 2 different health centers as her symptoms worsened. Health workers obtained a blood sample for Ebola testing, given that her husband was an Ebola survivor. His samples have tested negative since [28 Sep 2020].

She was admitted to an intensive care unit near Butembo on [4 Feb 2021], where she died the same day. On [5 Feb 2021], she was buried without Ebola safety protocols, and the following day her samples tested positive for Ebola. So far, 117 contacts have been identified for follow-up.

The WHO said resurgence is not surprising because of exposure to animal hosts or to body fluids of Ebola survivors, who may harbor the virus in immune protected body sites, including the testes and eyes.

- Thu 11 Feb 2021. More on 2nd case
[Radio Okapi (in French, machine trans., edited)]
https://www.radiookapi.net/2021/02/11/actualite/sante/butembo-deuxieme-deces-lie-ebola

In North Kivu, a 2nd case of Ebola virus disease has been recorded in the Biena health zone, Lubero territory. The provincial minister of health of North Kivu announced that the patient is a 60-year-old lady. She died on [Wed 10 Feb 2021] in Masoya, where the 1st case was reported. Dr Nzanzu Salita says the contact listing for this 2nd case is ongoing. The official delegate of the governor in this region indicates, for his part, that the local population is living in great fear at the moment.

Local sources testify that this 2nd Ebola victim was a farmer. She died in the town of Ngubi, located 4 kilometers [2.5 mi] from Masoya, where the very 1st case had been notified.

According to the provincial minister of health, this lady also visited the Ngubi health post where the 1st victim had passed through. Dr Nzanzu Salita indicates that investigations are underway to determine whether this new patient has been contaminated by the previous one, or if it is another case from elsewhere.

The minister claims that the patient's body was handled by members of the community before her burial, which constitutes, according to him, a great danger of the spread of the epidemic in the region. He calls on the community to be aware of this health threat.

Dr Nzanzu Salita indicates that the contact listing of this 2nd case is in progress, and at the same time announces the vaccination of all contacts already registered and even of all those who have not yet been vaccinated, because the vaccine arrived in Butembo last [Wed 10 Feb 2021].

The official delegate of the governor in the health zone of Biena, Monga Mabanga Julio, specifies that this situation is already creating panic and frustration among the inhabitants of this region.

[It is very concerning that personal protective behavior established during the prior Ebola outbreaks was apparently not followed during the burial of the 2nd case. This may start a chain of transmission allowing the virus to spread rapidly. One can only hope that the villagers are cooperative and the contact tracing effective at identifying possibly infected individuals who can then be vaccinated. - Mod.LK

[re: ProMED Ebola update (05): DR Congo, (NK) fatal 20210207.8173659]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
It may be beneficial to know if this case [the 1st case] has received a vaccination.

[ProMED thanks David Thomson for submitting this comment.

Since the woman who was the 1st fatal case was married to a man who had been infected and survived, she may have been vaccinated since she was a contact. If a subscriber has any information on her vaccination status, we would be interested in knowing. It would be particularly important if she was infected through sexual transmission and had been vaccinated. - Mod.LK
