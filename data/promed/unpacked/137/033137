Grand County has its 1st case of the vesicular stomatitis virus, a viral disease affecting numerous horses along the Front Range and in other states.

The Grand County CSU [Colorado State University] extension office warned of a suspected case of the virus in a horse last week [week of Mon 29 Jul 2019] when it sent an email blast to its members asking them to take precautions against the spread of the virus. The email detailed how the horse, which had recently attended an equine event in Fraser, showed signs of the virus, and a veterinarian had sent off blood samples to be tested.

Now, Colorado Department of Agriculture has Grand County listed on its website naming the affected counties with one active quarantine related to the virus, commonly known as VSV.

As of 4 p.m. MDT on Thursday [8 Aug 2019], there were 254 active quarantines across Colorado due to the virus. With 61, Larimer County had by far the most. It was followed by Boulder (28), Jefferson (25), Weld (25), Montezuma (23), La Platta (22), and Mesa (21) counties.

Boulder County had one confirmed bovine case; all others in Colorado were equine, though VSV can affect sheep, goats, llamas, and alpacas.

The virus causes blisters in an infected animal's mouth and on its lips, nostrils, tongue, hooves, and teats. The blisters are painful enough the infected animals often lose weight and show signs of lameness.

The virus can be transmitted through direct contact and indirect contact, including flies and other insects. For preventative measures, the extension office recommended horse and livestock owners use their fly spray liberally and refrain from sharing equipment like water buckets, hay bags, or bits.

While the American Association of Equine Practitioners says there are ways to reduce an infected animal's discomfort -- like soft feeds or anti-inflammatories to minimize swelling -- owners and vets can do little more than wait for healing and take appropriate precautions to minimize spreading the disease to other horses and livestock.

A 2006 study found VSV has been reported in the southeastern and southwestern US periodically since the early 1900s. It typically occurs over the summer months, and the study followed a series of outbreaks in the 2000s after the last significant outbreak had occurred in the 1990s.

Colorado was hit hard by the virus again in 2014, when VSV forced the quarantine of more than 200 properties, most in northern Colorado.

Since [Fri 2 Aug 2019], the Texas Animal Health Commission [TAHC] has received reports of 13 new confirmed cases of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and 16 new suspect cases.

The newly confirmed and suspect premises are under quarantine by the TAHC. Affected horses and cattle will be monitored by regulatory and authorized veterinarians until premises are eligible for quarantine release 14 days after clinical VSV signs are observed.

Premises that have laboratory diagnostic confirmation of VSV are categorized as confirmed positive premises. Once a county is confirmed as VSV-positive, new premises presenting with clinical signs of VSV in that county are not required to be tested for confirmation of the disease, but the premises will be quarantined and classified as a suspect premises.

The 2019 VSV outbreak began on 21 Jun 2019, when the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa, confirmed the 1st VSV-positive premises in Kinney County, Texas. All cases of VSV had been found on equine premises until 30 Jul 2019, when the 1st case of VSV was confirmed in cattle in Gonzales County. New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, and Oklahoma subsequently broke with cases that were confirmed by NVSL.

To date, 143 premises in 32 Texas counties have been quarantined for VSV. Currently affected counties include the following Bastrop, Bell, Brown, Caldwell, Coleman, Coryell, Eastland, Erath, Falls, Gonzales, Guadalupe, Haskell, Hood, Lampasas, Mason, McLennan, Mills, Palo Pinto, Parker, San Saba, Shackelford, Somervell, Taylor, Travis, and Williamson Counties.

Of the 143 premises quarantined, 52 have been released.

Several states are imposing enhanced entry requirements on Texas livestock due to the VSV cases. For information, contact the state of destination.

Since Fri 9 Aug 2019, the Texas Animal Health Commission has received reports of 4 new confirmed cases of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and 7 new suspect cases.

To date, 154 premises in 34 Texas counties have been quarantined for VSV. Currently affected counties include Bastrop, Bell, Bosque, Coleman, Coryell, Dallas, Eastland, Erath,
Guadalupe, Haskell, Hood, McLennan, Palo Pinto, Parker, Somervell, Taylor, Travis, and Williamson counties.

Of the 154 premises quarantined, 102 have been released.

VSV is a viral disease that primarily affects horses and cattle. In the past decade, the southwestern and western United States have experienced a number of VSV outbreaks. Outbreaks usually occur during the warmer months, often along waterways.

VSV normally has an incubation period of 2-8 days before the infected animal develops blisters that swell and burst, leaving painful sores. The virus can be transmitted through direct contact with infected animals or by blood-feeding insects.

If VSV is confirmed, infected animals are quarantined for 14 days after clinical signs of lesions are observed. This short-term quarantine helps prevent the movement of animals and the spread of the disease to other premises, fairs, or markets.

Even with the best defensive measures, VSV could infect a herd. However, these tips may help protect livestock:

- Control biting flies.
- Keep equine animals stalled or under a roof at night to reduce exposure to flies.
- Keep stalls clean.
- Don't visit a ranch that's under quarantine for VSV. Wait until the animals have healed.

TAHC sends out VSV updates every Friday, and all cases will be reported to the Equine Disease Communication Center (see https://equimanagement.com/news/vsv-update-in-texas).

[While some of these updates overlap slightly, it allows the reader to see the continuing spread of this disease. I encourage readers to look at the links and the maps.

VSV is not just a horse disease. It affects cattle as well, and it can also affect swine.

"Vesicular Stomatitis (VS) is a contagious disease that afflicts horses, livestock, wildlife, and even humans. The disease is caused by a virus, which, although rarely life threatening, can have significant financial impact on the horse industry. VS is a reportable disease; in a suspect case, state and federal animal health authorities will be contacted by your veterinarian. When a case of VS is confirmed, your state veterinarian's office will quarantine the affected farm or ranch. In an effort to minimize risk of spread of the disease, horses and other susceptible species will be confined to that location for at least 14 days from the onset of the last case on that property. Equestrian event organizers may also choose to cancel horse shows, rodeos, and other equestrian activities in the surrounding area. Interstate and international movement of horses may also be restricted.

"When vesicular stomatitis occurs in horses, blister-like lesions usually develop on the tongue, mouth lining, nose, or lips. In some cases, lesions can develop on the coronary bands, or on the udder or sheath. When VS is suspected, an exact diagnosis should be obtained by testing the blood for virus-specific antibodies or by testing swabs from the lesions to identify the presence of the virus. Testing is necessary to rule out the possibility that the lesions are caused by photosensitivity (sunburn), irritating feeds or weeds, or toxicity from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications like phenylbutazone.

"VS should not be confused with foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), which does not affect horses and was eradicated from the US in 1929. The incubation period for vesicular stomatitis -- meaning the time from exposure until the 1st signs appear -- ranges from 2-8 days. A fever may develop initially as blisters form on the tongue, gums, or coronary bands. One of the most obvious clinical signs is drooling or frothing at the mouth and potentially a reluctance to eat. This occurs following rupture of the blisters that create painful ulcers in the mouth. The surface of the tongue may slough. Excessive salivation is often mistaken as a result of a dental problem, just as a horse that is not eating well may be suspected as having colic. Weight loss may be a secondary effect, as a horse with mouth ulcers finds it too painful to eat. If lesions form around the coronary band, inflammation within the foot may result in lameness or laminitis. In severe (but rare) cases, the lesions on the coronary band may cause the hoof to slough.

"The disease generally runs its course within 2 weeks, although it may take as long as 2 months for the sores to entirely heal. Live virus can often be isolated from the lesions for up to a week after the lesions appear. During this time, the horse remains infective, and the potential remains for the disease to spread to other animals.

"While a horse is suffering from vesicular stomatitis, feeding soft feeds may reduce mouth discomfort. Anti-inflammatory medications may be used as supportive care help to minimize swelling and pain so a horse will continue to eat and drink. If the horse becomes dehydrated from not drinking enough water, your veterinarian may need to provide additional supportive care using intravenous fluids. Secondary bacterial infection of ulcerated areas is another concern. If fever, swelling, inflammation, or pus develops around the sores, treatment with antibiotics may be required. Flushing the mouth regularly with a dilute antiseptic solution, such as chlorhexidine in water, may reduce secondary bacterial contamination of the sores and speed healing. However, there is little more an owner or veterinarian can do but wait for healing to occur and take appropriate precautions to minimize the risk of spread of the disease to other horses and livestock.

"There are still some questions regarding how vesicular stomatitis is transmitted and why it only occurs sporadically in the US. The disease is distributed only in North, Central, and South America, with a greater incidence in warmer regions. Due to the seasonal occurrence of VS during summer through early fall, it is believed that insects such as biting flies and midges contribute to maintaining the lifecycle of the virus. Black flies, sand flies, and midges are known to transmit the virus, but there may be other insect vectors that have not yet been identified. VS also can be passed from horse to horse by contact with saliva or fluid from ruptured blisters. Physical contact between animals, or contact with buckets, equipment, housing, trailers, feed, bedding, shared water troughs, or other items used by an infected horse, can provide a ready means of spread."

VSV in the USA has been reported 2012-2015.

It is noteworthy this is the Indiana strain of the virus, not the New Jersey strain, which happened in the last outbreak.
