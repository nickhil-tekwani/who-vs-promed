EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES: WORLD HEALTH DAY, 1997
====================================================
Press Release WHO/28
4 April 1997
World Health Day 1997
"Emerging Infectious Diseases, Global Alert - Global Response"
In a ceremony to mark World Health Day 1997 (7 April), Dr Hiroshi Nakajima,
the Director-General of WHO, has warned against lowering our guard in the
fight against new and emerging diseases:
"Emerging infectious diseases were chosen as the theme for World Health Day
1997 to send a clear and urgent message: infectious diseases are still with
us. We must improve their detection and prevention, and never give up
searching for better ways to prevent, alleviate and cure them".
During the 1990s, emerging infectious diseases have become a major public
health concern. Some 30 new and highly infectious diseases have been
recorded in the last 20 years. The globalization of trade, the mass movement
internationally of huge numbers of people, either as tourists, business
travelers, migrants or refugees, the uncontrolled growth of megacities, and
changes in ecology and climate are creating new opportunities for the
re-emergence and spread of infections.
Underlying this is the rapidly developing resistance of bacteria, viruses
and parasites to drugs once highly effective against infections. At the same
time, there has been a decrease in the speed of development of new drugs, in
part due to the cost of their development and the risk that diseases may
become resistant to newly developed drugs in a relatively short time.
In addition, the availability of effective vaccines and antibiotics
developed in the 1950's and 1960's has led to a false sense of security
concerning communicable diseases. This in turn has resulted in a decline in
resources available to fund disease surveillance, diagnosis and control systems.
Paradoxically, one of the main reasons for this false sense of security has
been the success of the worldwide effort led by WHO and involving countries,
UN agencies, international organizations, NGOs [non-governmental
organizations], and others in controlling some of the most terrible diseases
facing humanity. Smallpox has been eradicated and other diseases such as
polio, leprosy and guinea-worm disease (dracunculiasis) are targeted for
eradication in the near future.
During the World Health Day ceremony Dr Nakajima opened a permanent
exhibition to commemorate the eradication of smallpox:
"The eradication of smallpox should serve as an inspiration and reminder of
what can be achieved with well-coordinated, well-motivated and
well-supported local, national and international efforts", said Dr Nakajima.
The exhibit gives an overview of the final ten years of the eradication
campaign, from 1967 until the last case, which was detected in Somalia
twenty years ago.
Among the artifacts on display are statues of Sitala Mata and Sopona, two of
the gods held responsible for smallpox, which illustrate the many myths and
superstitions which grew up around this dreaded disease. Also featured is an
original example of the bifurcated needle which played such a vital role in
the eradication campaign. The bifurcated needle, which was developed by
Wyeth Laboratories which waived all royalties for needles manufactured under
contract with WHO, is credited as one of the major factors which made
eradication possible. Another significant element in the success of the
eradication programme was the ability of vaccine manufacturers, such as
Merieux and Wyeth*, to produce large quantities of freeze-dried vaccine.
Together, the needle with its container and the freeze-dried heat stable
vaccine produced successful results even when used by vaccinators with
little training.
"The eradication of smallpox is an excellent example of international
cooperation", said Dr Nakajima, "but there are many other examples of
'unfinished business' such as the fight against polio, tuberculosis and
malaria. All infectious diseases are a common threat, especially at a time
when people all over the world are being brought closer together by
international travel and trade. Infectious diseases respect no frontiers. We
must work together globally to control them."
World Health Day 1997 with its theme "Emerging Infectious Diseases, Global
Alert - Global Response" is sounding a global warning to stimulate an
effective global response to the urgent problem of emerging diseases.
