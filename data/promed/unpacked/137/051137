[1] COVID-19 related stroke in young individuals
Date: Sept 2020

Evidence is mounting on the diverse neurological presentations associated with COVID-19. In a Rapid Review in The Lancet Neurology, Mark Ellul and colleagues nicely cover these findings, but we would like to emphasise the risk of associated stroke. As described in this Rapid Review, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might be more likely to cause thrombotic vascular events, including stroke, than other coronavirus and seasonal infectious diseases. In fact, a 7.6-fold increase in the odds of stroke with COVID-19 compared with influenza was recently reported. The reported incidence of cerebrovascular disease in patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 1% to 6%, potentially equating to large numbers of individuals as the pandemic progresses in some countries.

The proposed mechanisms for these cerebrovascular events include a hypercoagulable state from systemic inflammation and cytokine storm; postinfectious immune-mediated responses; and direct viral-induced endotheliitis or endotheliopathy, potentially leading to angiopathic thrombosis, with viral particles having been isolated from the endothelium of various tissue, including brain tissue. Multiple regions with high COVID-19 prevalence have reported stable or increased incidence of large vessel stroke and increased incidence of cryptogenic stroke (patients with no found typical cause of stroke), despite observing a decrease in mild stroke that is possibly secondary to quarantine and self-isolation. This quarantine effect is supported by a nationwide analysis in the USA of automated stroke imaging processing software showing decreased imaging evaluation for stroke during the pandemic. Our group observed that 5 patients younger than 50 years who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, some with no vascular risk factors, were admitted with large vessel stroke to our hospitals during a 2-week period (23 Mar to 7 Apr 2020) during the height of the pandemic in New York City (NY, USA). This was a 7-fold increase in the rate of large vessel stroke in young people compared with the previous year [2019], and the patients had laboratory findings that suggested a hypercoagulable state, leading to the postulation that stroke was probably related to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in these young patients.

Since then, this observation of COVID-19 related stroke in young patients has been supported by additional data from other centres worldwide. The mean patient age in several thrombectomy case series of COVID-19 (mean age of 52.8 years in a series from New York City [NY, USA], mean age of 59.5 years in a series from Paris [France], and mean age of 59.5 years in a combined series from New York City and Philadelphia [PA, USA] is younger than the typical population having this procedure. Furthermore, in patients presenting with large vessel stroke during the pandemic, data from the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City confirm that patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were significantly younger, with a mean age of 59 years (standard deviation [SD] 13), than patients who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, who had a mean age of 74 years (SD 17), mirroring the findings of the Paris group. Patients with COVID-19 who had imaging confirmed stroke and were admitted to another large New York City medical centre were again found to be younger, with a mean age of 63 years (SD 17), than a control group of patients with stroke who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 and had a mean age of 70 years (SD 18). A case-control analysis of acute stroke protocol imaging from late March to early April, 2020, across a large New York City health system showed that, after adjusting for age, sex, and vascular risk factors, SAS-CoV-2 positivity was independently associated with stroke.

Many reports have documented an increased thrombosis risk early in COVID-19 and coagulation abnormalities in D-dimer and fibrinogen can be found in patients with mild symptoms. There are many reports of early COVID-19 presenting with thrombotic events, which has led to the consensus to start anticoagulation therapy early in the COVID-19 disease course before any thrombotic event. There are reports in the literature specifically addressing macrothrombosis in the internal carotid artery in patients with mild respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 and stroke as a presenting symptom of the disease. A multicentre series of 26 patients with COVID-19 and either ischaemic or haemorrhagic events reported that 27% were younger than 50 years. Additionally, the report stated that 2 of 15 patients with large vessel stroke were younger than 50 years and without previous stroke risk factors. In this study, consistent with other case series, patients with COVID-19 fare worse in terms of clinical outcomes than patients with stroke who do not have COVID-19. This is probably related, in part, to the COVID-19 disease process.

In conclusion, data supporting an association between COVID-19 and stroke in young populations without typical vascular risk factors, at times with only mild respiratory symptoms, are increasing. Future prospective registries to study this association further, as well as studies of anticoagulation to prevent these potentially life devastating events, are under way. We believe that, in otherwise healthy, young patients who present with stroke during the pandemic, the diagnosis of COVID-19 should be thoroughly investigated. Conversely, in patients with mild COVID-19 respiratory symptoms, a low threshold for investigation for stroke should be maintained if they present with new neurological symptoms.

["Strokes in patients with COVID-19 may be due to usual causes such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. In this review, however, we focus on mechanisms of stroke that appear to be directly related to COVID-19. It seems likely that these COVID-19-related mechanisms would also increase the risk of stroke in infected persons who harbor the more conventional stroke risk factors.

"Three main mechanisms appear to be responsible for the occurrence of ischemic strokes in COVID-19. These include a hypercoagulable state, vasculitis, and cardiomyopathy. While the pathogenesis of hemorrhagic strokes in the setting of COVID-19 has not been fully elucidated, it is possible that the affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 for ACE2 receptors, which are expressed in endothelial and arterial smooth muscle cells in the brain, allows the virus to damage intracranial arteries, causing vessel wall rupture.

"In addition, it is possible that the cytokine storm that accompanies this disorder could be the cause of hemorrhagic strokes, as reported in a COVID-19 patient who developed an acute necrotizing encephalopathy associated with late parenchymal brain hemorrhages. This massive release of cytokines may also damage and result in breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and cause hemorrhagic posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome."(https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/509581).

The immediate and long term sequelae associated with COVID19 infections are still undergoing research. More information is needed to modify the treatment modalities so as to prevent their occurrence. - Mod.UBA]

Highlights
----------
- Evidence suggests the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via aerosols is plausible under favorable conditions.
- We synthesized the evidence for aerosol transmission and highlight the scenarios where SARS-CoV-2 aerosols may be pertinent to transmission.
-We summarize precautions and infection control strategies to mitigate aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Abstract
--------
As public health teams respond to the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), containment and understanding of the modes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission is of utmost importance for policy making. During this time, governmental agencies have been instructing the community on handwashing and physical distancing measures. However, there is no agreement on the role of aerosol transmission for SARS-CoV-2. To this end, we aimed to review the evidence of aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Several studies support that aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is plausible, and the plausibility score (weight of combined evidence) is 8 out of 9. Precautionary control strategies should consider aerosol transmission for effective mitigation of SARS-CoV-2.

[Secretions and excreta from an infected person containing virus can be aerosolized into infectious virus-containing droplets or particles through a variety of ways. Respiratory secretions are known to be aerosolized through daily activities (for example: exhaling, talking, coughing, and sneezing) and certain medical procedures (for example: tracheal intubation, non-invasive ventilation, bronchoscopy, and tracheotomy). Excreta can also be aerosolized through flushing toilets. Materials deposited onto surfaces can be re-aerosolized by human activities (for example: walking, cleaning, and opening doors/windows, etc). Biological specimens can be aerosolized through improper handling during laboratory procedures. In all of these contexts, infectious aerosols can pose an infection risks to people, influenced by complex environmental factors which affect the survival, transport and fate of aerosolized virus.

The authors conclude that 'In the hospital and healthcare settings, ventilation is a primary control strategy for infectious diseases, which promotes the air dilution around a source and the removal of respiratory viruses' and 'In public settings, adequate natural ventilation, reduced use of central air conditioning, increasing air ex-change rates, and use of common or antimicrobial filters in ventilation systems are recommended' and 'Frontline HCWs (healthcare workers) who come in direct contact with potentially infected patients, such as doctors, nurses, allied health workers, phlebotomists collecting medical laboratory specimens, food service staff, cleaners and laboratory professionals in open-space laboratories should wear proper personal protective equipment (PPE)'.

The new 'normal' indeed requires more precautionary measures against SARS-CoV2 transmission for the foreseeable feature. - Mod.UBA]

[These countries were selected on account of having had significant surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections but having responded differently. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. Lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences and more widespread community-based transmission.

In South Korea, it looks like major transmission is continuing. Previously, when there were major events, time-limited increased restrictions were implemented, and as of 21 Aug 2020, they are being implemented again. A key takeaway message is that the virus is still circulating globally, and relaxing of the guard (eliminating simple measures of social distancing, face masks, hand washing, and large gatherings) is an open invitation for the virus to re-enter with clusters of cases and ultimately community transmission. - Mods.MPP/UBA]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

Data by country, area, or territory can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesAug26_1598542336.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 42.3% of daily case numbers and 51.3% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 12.6 million cases. The USA and Brazil still dominate with Peru, Colombia, Argentina, and Mexico very active as well.

- The European region reported 12.3% of daily case numbers and 9.1% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours and total cumulative cases reported exceed 4 million. Russia still dominates followed by France, Ukraine, Turkey, Germany, UK, Israel, and Italy. Belgium did not report any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 6% of daily case numbers and 7.1% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 1.8 million cases. Iraq still dominates followed by Iran, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Libya. Lebanon continues to have increased cases as does the Palestinian Authority.

- The African region reported 2.5% of daily case numbers and 4.8% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and have reported more than 1 million cases. South Africa had the highest number of cases in last 24 hours followed closely by Ethiopia, Algeria, Nigeria, Botswana, Rwanda, Cameroon, and Kenya.

- The Western Pacific region reported 2% of daily case numbers and 1.1% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.46 million cases. The Philippines continues to dominate, followed by Japan and South Korea.

- The South East Asia region reported 34.8% of the daily newly reported cases and 26.3% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 3.7 million cases. India continues to dominate, followed by Bangladesh, Indonesia and Nepal.

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region, and the Western Pacific region representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions. While regional proportions may not reflect this, most of the regions have countries with resurgences associated with lifting of restrictions.

On the overview tab at the WHO source URL, the epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases by WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 26 Aug 2020, is the same epidemic curve included in the previous situation updates and is an excellent visual representation of the epidemic as described in the text above. - Mod.UBA]

[The USA, Brazil, and India are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (75 995), followed by Brazil (47 828), and the USA (44 637) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (53.5%). There were 6338 deaths reported in the past 24 hours (25-26 Aug 2020).

In descending rank order, India is number one for the number of newly confirmed in the past 24 hours, followed by Brazil, USA, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Russia, France, Philippines Mexico, Iraq, and Spain. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed goes from 3564 to 75 995. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: South Africa, Bangladesh, Iran, Indonesia, Israel, Ukraine, Ecuador, Italy, Morocco, Ethiopia, and Turkey, and their range of reported new cases is 1313 to 2684. A total of 27 countries have reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is a small change in the average number of daily reported cases (a decrease of 2.7%), while daily reported deaths have remained virtually the same (an increase of 0.55%. The key question remains as to whether transmission is in fact slowing down or whether these figures reflect reporting artifact seen surrounding weekends.

Impression: Basically unchanged from previous discussions -- the SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality, while the global 7-day averages seem to reflect a slowing down of reporting confirmed cases; however, I still wonder whether this is real or reflects a changing pattern with decreased testing or case reporting. For example, the USA reported data suggest a slowing down of transmission over the past 2 weeks as seen by the comparative 7-day averages in reported new cases (see section [3E] above). The most severely affected region is the Americas, with increasing daily case counts, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). India also drives the next most affected region -- South East Asia -- with persistent high daily case reports. - Mod.UBA]
