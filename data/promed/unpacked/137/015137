CWD-positive white-tailed deer found on Iowa County farm

A white-tailed deer from a deer farm in Iowa County has tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD), Wisconsin State Veterinarian Dr. Paul McGraw announced today (29 Jan 2016). The National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa, confirmed the test results.

The 2-year-old buck, which was born on the farm and killed after sustaining an injury, was among only 15 deer reported to be on the 1-acre farm, according to the farm's June 2015 registration. The owner keeps a small number of deer for public exhibition only and does not move the deer anywhere except to slaughter. All of the owner's deer that have died or been sent to slaughter since 2002 have been tested for CWD.

Samples were taken from the buck on 9 Jan 2016 in accordance with Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection's (DATCP's) rules, which require testing of farm-raised deer and elk when they die or are killed.

The farm has been quarantined since 2008, when wild deer within a 5-mile radius were diagnosed with CWD. The DATCP Animal Health Division's investigation will also examine the animal's history and trace movements of deer onto the property to determine whether any other deer farms may have exposure to CWD.

[This county has been known to have CWD. However, if nothing has moved on or off of the property, then one might suspect either feed -- which seems unlikely if it is corn -- or there is transfer from wild deer urine coming through the fence. - Mod.TG
