5 Dead in Sierra Leone's First Ebola Outbreak
-------------------------------
5 people have died in Sierra Leone's 1st confirmed outbreak of ebolavirus, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday [26 May
2014].

Ebola virus disease (EVD), a haemorrhagic fever with a fatality rate of up to 90 percent, has killed more than 100 people in neighbouring
Guinea and Liberia since March [2014] in the first deadly appearance of the disease in West Africa. In a statement posted on its website,
the WHO said the outbreak in Sierra Leone was located in an area along the country's border with Guinea's Gueckedou prefecture, where some of the earliest cases of the disease were recorded. "Preliminary information received from the field indicates that one
laboratory-confirmed case and 5 community deaths have been reported from Koindu chiefdom," it said.

The WHO said it was immediately deploying 6 experts to the area along with essential supplies. Previously, several suspected cases of Ebola were recorded in Sierra Leone early on in the West African outbreak, but they later tested negative for the disease. Ebola has been more commonly found in Central Africa including Democratic Republic of Congo and Gabon, and in Uganda and South Sudan.

[3] External aid
Date: 26 May 2014
From: Robert F. Garry <rfgarry@tulane.edu> [edited]


We would like to inform ProMED readers that in point of fact our teams from Harvard and Tulane who have worked at the KGH [Kenema Government Hospital] site on Lassa fever for a decade http://www.plosntds.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pntd.0002748
and were instrumental in setting up ebolavirus diagnostics at KGH.

I myself am heading to KGH tomorrow to bring PPE [personal protective equipment, e.g. masks, face shields, gowns, gloves - Mod.JW] and more diagnostic reagents.

[This contradicts earlier reports that the cases were not EVD.

But it is not clear if the 4 (later 5) "community deaths" were lab confirmed, given that all VHF cases in Serra Leone tested up to this one Ebola
positive turned out to have been cases of Lassa fever.

The scale of external medical aid to Sierra Leone in the past and again now is impressive.
