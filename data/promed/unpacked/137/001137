Outbreak of Vero cytotoxin producing Escherichia coli O157 infection in
northern England
-----------------------
A total of 38 cases of Vero cytotoxin producing _Escherichia coli_ O157
(VTEC O157) infection (18 adults and 20 children) had been confirmed
microbiologically by noon on 10 Mar 1999 in an outbreak linked with the
consumption of milk from a local farm in northern Cumbria in the north of
England.
The dates of onset of illness range from 20 Feb to 3 Mar 1999.
Twenty-seven people (11 adults and 16 children) have been admitted to
hospital, including three children who were transferred to Newcastle for
treatment of haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS).
A heat treatment order and a prohibition notice (preventing the sale of any
remaining milk) were served on 3 Mar 1999 by Allerdale Borough Council.
North Cumbria Health Authority and the local authority issued a joint
statement to the press on 3 Mar 1999 warning consumers not to drink any
milk still in their possession.
Preliminary analysis of a case control study of 20 cases and 52 controls
conducted over the weekend of 6/7 Mar 1999 demonstrated a significant
association between consumption of milk from the farm and illness (p =
<0.00003). Microbiological investigations on the farm are continuing.
Twenty-six of the isolates have been further characterised by the PHLS
Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens (LEP) and have been shown to be _E. coli_
O157, Vero cytotoxin 2 (VT2), phage type 21/28. Subtyping of the VT2 genes
shows the isolates carry two VT2 genes (VT2 and VT2c). Analysis by pulsed
field gel electrophoresis is in progress. The isolates are sensitive to
antimicrobials included in the LEP panel. Phage type 21/28 is a common type
both in England and Wales and in Scotland. About 13% of VTEC O157 isolates
confirmed by LEP in 1998 were of PT21/28. Apart from those known to be
linked to the outbreak in North Cumbria, LEP has reported on 15 isolates of
PT21/28 in 1999 (11 in England and Wales, four in Northern Ireland).
Analysis of outbreak data shows that 12 outbreaks have been caused by VTEC
O157 PT21/28 (four in 1996, six in 1997, and two in 1998). None of these
outbreaks was associated [with any other.
