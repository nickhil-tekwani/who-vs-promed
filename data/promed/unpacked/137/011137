This week, the Health Surveillance of Camaqua issued an alert for yellow fever in the interior of the municipality. Of the 4 dead howler monkeys that were found, one underwent testing to identify the presence of the disease, transmitted by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito. [_Aedes aegypti_ transmits yellow fever virus between humans in urban and suburban settings. _Haemagogus_ and _Sabethes_ are the genera of the forest mosquitoes that transmit the virus among non-human primates. - Mod.TY]

According to the coordinator of Surveillance, Fabiano Martins, 2 dead howler monkeys were found in Santa Auta, one in Vila Aurora and the other in Banhado no Colegio. The latter had died more recently and, therefore, it was possible to collect material for analysis.

Last week, the Municipal and State Health Surveillance teams carried out orientation and awareness visits about yellow fever in the interior of the Municipality. There were 145 properties visited and the results have already started to appear. "We remember that the disease is transmitted by a mosquito, the howler monkey is our sentinel, it gets sick first and shows us that the virus is present."

Yellow fever is an acute, vaccine-preventable viral disease transmitted to humans and non-human primates (monkeys and howler monkeys) through the bite of infected mosquitoes.

This week, the city of Chuvisca issued an alert after confirming a case of the disease. According to Secretary Sheila da Silva's report to the Clic Camaqua report, a dead howler monkey was found in a locality in the interior of Chuvisca and after testing, the presence of yellow fever in the animal was confirmed. The animal was found in the Rincao locality. As stated in the alert issued by the Health Department of Chuvisca, the material that was collected tested positive for the presence of the disease [virus].

[The eventual (likely) confirmation of yellow fever will not be a surprise. ProMED-PORT has been reporting yellow fever epizootics in the state of Rio Grande do Sul since the beginning of the year (2021, see below) and the circulation of the virus in the state this year led to the declaration of a public health emergency (see PRO/PORT> Yellow fever - Brazil (15) (RS), declaration, public health emergency Archive Number: 20210429.8337216, https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8337216).

Regarding the circulation of the yellow fever virus in Rio Grande do Sul, there is a comment from a previous post (PRO/PORT> Yellow fever - Brazil (12) (RS), confirmed non-human primates, suspected human Archive Number: 20210415.8309370, https: //promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=8309370):

Since 2019, the circulation of the yellow fever virus has been progressing and being identified in the north-south direction from the south of the state of SÃ£o Paulo... Since then, Parana, Santa Catarina and is now detected in the capital of Rio Grande do Sul. Although apparently restricted to sylvan (forest) cycles, there is currently an evident circulation of the yellow fever virus in the states of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul, with numerous epizootics and, in Santa Catarina, with human cases. The identification of circulation in Porto Alegre is worrying, including the current pandemic context in which there is an intense overload on the surveillance system and the assistance network due to the high number of cases of COVID-19. It remains to be seen how the response capacity is in the active search for suspected cases of yellow fever, entomological research, vector control and, above all, actions to intensify immunization against yellow fever at a time of vaccination campaign against COVID-19 and more recently, influenza.

About Camaqua: Territorial area: 1680 km2 (Urban area: 77.95%, rural area: 22.05%); population: 63 128 inhabitants; distance to the capital: 127 km [79 mi]. (Source: https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camaqu%C3%A3). - Mod.RNA

Cases of sylvan (forest) yellow fever (YF) in humans and monkeys have been occurring in several states in Brazil this year (2021). YF virus is endemic in forested areas in Brazil with deaths occurring among non-human primates. The human cases represent spillover from the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle. Fortunately, there has been no urban yellow fever transmission in Brazil since 1942. Increased surveillance is important to know where yellow fever virus transmission is taking place. People living in or visiting these localities should be vaccinated to avoid more human cases. - Mod.T
