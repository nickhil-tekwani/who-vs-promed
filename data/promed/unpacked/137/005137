La Tribuna newspaper in Honduras reported the following on September
30,1997. In the first nine months of 1997 more dengue cases have been
reported then all of 1996. The ministry of Health has declared a state of
alert. San Pedro Sula and the surrounding area have been hardest hit with
more then 6000 cases. Comayagua, El Progreso, Tegucigalpa, Tela and Toatan
have been also affected. There has been at least one reported death by
hemorrhagic dengue fever. Virginia Figueroa de Espinoza indicated that
since July 1997 cases have increased substantially.
[Whereas it is not ProMED-mail's mission to accrue epidemiological data, it
would be useful for all of us if we were able to post information regarding
the specific dengue virus or viruses circulating in Honduras, how many
cases have occurred, what is the attack rate, etc. -Mod. CHC]
