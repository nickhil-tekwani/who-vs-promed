A Taos County woman has died of complications from a hantavirus
infection, the state Department of Health says. The 59-year-old
woman, who had been treated at the University of New Mexico, is the
only person to have been diagnosed with the illness so far this year
[2007] in New Mexico.
The disease is transmitted by infected rodents -- particularly deer
mice -- through urine, droppings or saliva. People contract the
disease by breathing in the dried particles infected with the virus.
Early symptoms include fever and muscle aches, possibly with chills,
headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and a cough. The
symptoms develop one to 6 weeks after exposure. There is no specific
treatment for hantavirus, but officials said the chances for recovery
are better if people get medical attention early.
The Department advises airing out closed buildings before entering,
cleaning up nests and droppings using disinfectant, sealing homes and
cabins so mice cannot enter, trapping mice until they are gone,
getting rid of trash and junk piles, not leaving pet food and water
where mice could get to them and putting wood, hay and compost piles
as far as possible from the house.
New Mexico had 8 hantavirus cases, 3 of them fatal, last year [2006].
The state had one case in 2005 and 4 in 2004. Since hantavirus was
1st identified in 1993 in the Four Corners area, there have been 74
cases and 31 deaths in New Mexico. Nationwide, 465 cases have been
reported in 31 states, according to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention in Atlanta. About 35 percent of all reported cases
have proved fatal.

The particular hantavirus involved has not been identified, but it is
likely to be Sin Nombre virus on account of proximity to the Four
Corners area, where the 1st virus responsible for hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome was isolated. For background information, see;
