DHAKA - Floods receded further in Bangladesh yesterday amid warnings
that water-borne disease was spreading among the 30 million people
affected by the disaster. A health department official reported
10 784 fresh attacks of diarrhoea in the past 24 hours which claimed
14 more lives, taking the toll from the epidemic to almost 200.
Receding floods left a trail of epidemics, and health officials
yesterday reported an alarming situation in parts of worst-hit
central Bangladesh and in the country's north. The official said
medical teams have reported a total of 229 050 diarrhoea cases.
"The reports are coming in from everywhere, but the disease is more
rampant in the (northern) districts of Rangpur, Kurigram and Naogaon
and in Kishoreganj, Tangail and Narshingdi (in central Bangladesh),"
he said. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed in an interview to AFP
on Tuesday said that her government had mobilized all available
medical facilities to prevent a health disaster in the country of 120
million people.
[In view of soon-to-be-confirmed reports of cholera O139 in Pakistan,
the situation may be quite serious. Cholera O139 is a new strain
which appeared in 1997 & affected Bangladesh, China, India,
Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka & Thailand in addition to the El
Tor type, with occasional importations into Europe - Mod.JW
