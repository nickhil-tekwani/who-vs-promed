Hundreds of goats have died of an unknown disease over the past 4
days in Birbhum's Rampurhat block II.
Some experts warned that if the H5N1 virus -- which causes bird flu
-- has jumped from birds to mammals, it could be the turn of humans next.
TOI met [anxious] villagers in Dakhalbati, one of the affected
villages in Birbhum's Margram. [One of the farmers], said his goat
was shivering and sneezing and saliva was oozing from its mouth. [The
farmer] had called in a local vet, who could only say the animal was
suffering from high fever but could not pinpoint a disease. Though he
prescribed medicines, those have not worked.
[The farmer], who has already lost 35 chickens to bird flu, is now
scared about his livestock. He said that several neighbours had lost
their goats as well to the mystery ailment.
His neighbour, has buried 7 goats over the past 2 days. They were
suffering from a similar disease. In their case, too, drugs
prescribed refused to work. The animals had fever and their throats
started swelling before they fell unconscious and died within
minutes. At Dakhalbati, more than 60 goats have died so far.
Villagers are blaming bird flu, as the symptoms are similar. But the
state administration has claimed there was no information of cattle
dying in the district. "It could be pneumonia, which commonly affects
goats. But an H5N1 attack is not impossible. Pigs are proven carriers
and since these goats have been sharing space with the affected
birds, they are vulnerable. Chances of humans contracting the disease
can't be ruled out," said Shyamalendu Chatterjee of the Indian
Council for Medical Research.
Others like Barun Roy, an animal diseases expert, pointed out that
H5N1 was yet to affect cattle anywhere in the world. "It is unheard
of. The goats must have been suffering from pneumonia," Roy said. The
state administration, too, has claimed it had no information of goats
dying in the district.
Bird flu has resulted in huge financial losses for the villagers.
They are not happy with the compensation. Now, most are trying to
sell off their goats. "I have sold 3 goats at a low price. If this
disease is bird flu, goats would be killed and I would lose my entire
investment," said Mohammad Motier Rahaman, who lost 3 goats in 2 days.
Reports of hundreds of goats dying have also come in from
Murshidabad's Khargram and Beldanga areas.

[The appearance of a goat disease in a region suffering avian
influenza in poultry, does not mean both species are infected by the
same disease agent; its possible involvement in the condition
described seems remote.
The epidemiological and clinical information, provided in the
newswire above, is rather deficient. If the available data are
accurate, it appears that mortality may be high and the condition
characterised by high fever, respiratory distress, probably
submandibular edema ("swelled throats" preceding "sudden death"), and
of short duration. This may indicate an infectious agent, though some
toxicological agents may cause fever as well (if indeed "hundreds of
goats have died over 4 days", a toxicological agent can not be excluded).
Among the diseases to be included in the DD (differential diagnosis),
contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP, a mycoplasma disease),
pasteurellosis, bluetongue, anaplasmosis, babesiosis, and acute PPR
(peste des petits ruminants) could be considered. In case the animals
are grazing, helminths cannot be excluded.
More information is requested, in particular morbidity and mortality
rates, detailed clinical and pathological findings, age of affected
animals, duration of illness, haematological data (anaemia?!),
husbandry (grazing? handfed?), recent application of veterinary drugs
and/or vaccines. Foremost, laboratory test results are anticipated.
