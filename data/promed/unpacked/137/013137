Two suspected cases of anthrax have been reported from Vizag Agency. The 47- and 35-year-old cases were shifted from Araku to King George Hospital (KGH) in the city for treatment.

About 2 weeks ago, 25 tribal families belonging to Kinchumanda in Dumbriguda mandal, consumed meat of a dead goat. After a couple of days, a few of them had ulcers on their fingers. As they approached the local hospitals, doctors initially prescribed antibiotics.

However, 5 of them were shifted to Araku community hospital last Thursday after their condition was found to be abnormal. Later, after deterioration of their health, they were moved to KGH in Vizag.

Sources said the tribals have been suffering from different ailments and ulcers, which are symptoms of anthrax, as they consumed a goat that died of snakebite. When contacted, DM & HO Dr R. Syamala said the laboratory reports confirmed that the cases were negative. The blood samples have been sent to Gwalior for further investigation, she added.

She said that officials have been conducting a medical camp in the village for the last 4 days. On Friday [14 Jun 2013], temporary medical officer Sobha, who has been working at Paderu community health centre, was suspended for failing to refer the cases to KGH immediately.

[Anthrax is a constant threat in Andra Pradesh, with significant losses to cattle, small ruminants, and secondary cases in humans, the latter sometimes with deaths. Although this report has 2 named individuals being hospitalised, there are 5 others with different names also being referred to KGH in Vizag. One of the many problems of diagnosing anthrax in humans is the speed that they initiate treatment with antibiotics, sometimes before seeing any physician or nurse practitioner, and before samples are collected for laboratory examination.

Vizakhapatam is in the NE corner of the state; see the following map to find Andra Pradesh in SE India: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/india_pol01.jpg.
