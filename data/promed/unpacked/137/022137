Royal Caribbean cruise line officials reported that there were 220 cases of a stomach virus on board the Independence of the Seas after it departed from Port Everglades [Broward county, Florida] on [Mon 11 Dec 2017]. The ship returned to Port Everglades on [Sat 16 Dec 2017, and] many passengers relieved they were on dry land after a 5-night cruise to the Caribbean.

A passenger on board the ship told WSVN 7 News that people began to show symptoms of the gastrointestinal illness on [Wed 13 Dec 2017].

As passengers disembarked from the ship on [Sat 16 Dec 2017], cruise line employees were seen wearing gloves as they handled passengers' routine needs on dock, WPLG's Erika Rakow posted on Twitter.

On [Thu 14 Dec 2017], Royal Caribbean distributed a letter to passengers alerting them to a possible norovirus outbreak on board as more than 200 sought attention, overwhelming the ship's 3 nurses, WPLG reported.

The letter read, in part, "In an abundance of caution, we have implemented enhanced sanitizing procedures onboard, as recommended by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Public Health Agencies worldwide."

According to the CDC, norovirus or acute gastroenteritis, causes inflammation of the stomach or intestines or both. The most common symptoms are diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and stomach pain. One can also have fever, headache, and body aches. Dehydration is the greater concern, especially among young children, the elderly or those with other illnesses.

There is no specific medicine to treat people with norovirus illness and it can't be treated with antibiotics because it is a viral, rather than bacterial, infection.

Those who feel they have norovirus should drink plenty of liquids to replace fluid lost from throwing up and diarrhea to prevent dehydration.

The cases represented less than 5 percent of the 5547 guests and crew members on board, Royal Caribbean spokesman Owen Torres told WPLG.

The ship, swabbed clean at Port Everglades, is due to depart Saturday afternoon [16 Dec 2017].

[Gastrointestinal illness is relatively infrequent on cruise ships according to CDC. From 2008 to 2014, 74 million passengers sailed on cruise ships in the Vessel Sanitation Program's jurisdiction. Only 129 678 passengers met the program's case definition for acute gastrointestinal illness and only a small proportion of those cases (1 in 10) were part of a norovirus outbreak. But the close living quarters on cruise ships increase the amount of group contact which facilitates spread of this highly contagious virus (excerpted from https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/vsp/pub/norovirus/norovirus.htm). - Mod LK

According to the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS), local and state public health officials across the state are seeing an increase in outbreaks of gastrointestinal illnesses -- investigating 8 norovirus outbreaks in the last 6 weeks. Outbreaks of norovirus often increase in winter months and this year's [2017] activity is similar to outbreaks seen in 2016. This year's outbreaks have occurred in the counties of Cascade, Fergus, Flathead, Gallatin, Meagher, Missoula, Silver Bow, and Yellowstone.

Norovirus, a very contagious virus that can affect anyone, is the most common cause of gastroenteritis in Montana and the US. In fact, the average American gets infected with this virus 5 times in their lifetime.

"Different strains of norovirus can circulate through the state and there is no vaccine," said Dana Fejes of the DPHHS Communicable Disease Epidemiology Section. "Your best method of prevention is to wash your hands often with soap and water. Once infected, stay hydrated to avoid complications."

The usual symptoms of norovirus include diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and stomach pain. There is no specific treatment for this illness and most individuals recover in 1-3 days. The illness can last longer and be more severe in young children, older people, or people who have other chronic health conditions.

The virus is highly contagious and can spread rapidly between persons and through contaminated food or water. Norovirus can survive on surfaces and be transferred to other people when they touch the contaminated surface.

DPHHS and local authorities are reminding individuals to do their part to protect the community. "Stay home when you are ill and don't prepare food for others," Fejes said.

[Norovirus is the leading cause of illness and outbreaks from contaminated food in the United States. Food service settings are often the source of outbreaks. See https://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/reporting/norostat/data.html: NoroSTAT data for total number of suspected and confirmed norovirus outbreaks reported each week by states in the US participating in NoroSTAT. One can see from the figure in the report that 2017 looks very similar to 2016 to date. From 1 Aug 2017 to 7 Nov 2017, there were 118 norovirus outbreaks reported by NoroSTAT-participating states. During the same period last year (2016), there were 137 norovirus outbreaks reported by these states. The figure and additional links can be found at the URL cited. - Mod.LK
