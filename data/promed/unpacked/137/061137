1st report of the natural occurrence of tobacco streak virus on blackgram
(_Vigna mungo_)
-----------------------------------------------
D Ladhalakshmi <ladasalam@yahoo.co.in>, M Ramiah, T Ganapathy, Salah Eddin
Khabbaz, Merin Babu, Department of Plant Pathology, Tamil Nadu
Agricultural University, Coimbatore, India; M Krishna Reddy, A
Kamalakannan, Indian Institute of Horticultural Research, Hassargutta,
Bangalore, India. Accepted for publication 2 Sep 2005.
Blackgram (_Vigna mungo_; family _Fabaceae_) is an important pulse crop in
India, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Myanmar. During kharif season of the south
west land wind during the monsoon (Jun-Sep 2002), a new disease was
observed in the majority of the blackgram growing areas of India.
Symptoms of the disease consisted of brown necrotic lesions on young
leaves, with brown streaks on petioles and stems. In severe cases, infected
plants were dead. Mechanical inoculation of plant sap from infected plants
onto various plant species: _Vigna unguiculata_ cv. 152 (_Fabaceae_),
_Nicotiana tabaccum_ (_Solanaceae_), _Chenopodium amaranticolor_
(_Chenopodiaceae_), and _Gomphrena globosa_ (_Amaranthaceae_) produced
necrotic lesions on leaves and streaks on stems. Alternate hosts may also
play role in disease epidemiology, since tobacco streak virus (TSV) infects
many widely distributed weeds. For example, _Parthenium hysterophorus_
probably plays a major role in the spread of TSV in peanut (_Arachis
hypogaea_) (Prasada Rao, et al. 2003).
Infected leaf samples of blackgram tested positive for TSV by DAC-ELISA
(Bhat, et al. 2001) using a specific polyclonal antibody (a gift from G
Cook, Plant Protection Research Institute, South Africa). Electron
microscopic observations of negatively-stained preparations of purified
virus from infected blackgram leaves revealed spheres with a diameter of 27
nm; consistent with TSV infection. RT-PCR tests of tissue from diseased
blackgram plants using primers specific for the coat protein gene of TSV
(Bhat, et al. 2002) resulted in an amplicon of the expected size: ca. 700bp).
SV infects a wide range of hosts in India (Prasada Rao, et al. 2003). This
is the 1st report of the natural occurrence of TSV on _Vigna mungo_.

[TSV is transmitted by _Frankliniella occidentalis_ and _Thrips tabaci_;
_Thysanoptera_ (possibly by allowing virus from the surface of infected
pollen to enter through feeding wounds; Sdoodee and Teakle, 1987). The
virus is transmitted by mechanical inoculation and grafting. TSV is readily
transmitted via seed to high levels in _Phaseolus vulgaris_. It is also
transmitted by pollen to pollinated plants. Disease management depends
mainly on planting virus-free seed.
