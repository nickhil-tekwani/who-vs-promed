Cameroon: measles outbreak strikes
----------------------------------
A measles outbreak has hit the town of Maroua in northern Cameroon
[Extreme-Nord province], leaving 2 dead and over 160 infected. Medical
officials in the town are on high alert to abate the progress of what they
now refer to as an epidemic.

It should be recalled that the 1st cases of measles were diagnosed in
March, April, and May of 2008. The virus later appeared to have been
contained since October 2008. The disease now appears to have witnessed an
upsurge.

The majority of cases reported cases live in specific neighbourhoods such
as Dogouil, Baligo-kodec, Domayo, and Lopere. This has raised fears that
checking the spread can be increasingly difficult to deal with.

However, health officials in the region have assured the population that
measures are being put in place to curb the spread of the disease. They
have urged vulnerable persons and all suspected cases to report to health
facilities as soon as possible for as they argue, early detection is
imperative as it guarantees speedy treatment.

Cameroon: measles outbreak in Extreme-Nord province
---------------------------------------------------
The current balance is 3 deaths. The regional health authorities of the
Maroua urban area issued a measles epidemic alert at the beginning of last
week [week of 5 Jan]. About 160 cases and 2 deaths have been reported to
date in the different health districts of Maroua.

If the reluctance of the rural population to seek medial assistance, except
in the most extreme circumstances, is taken into account, it is likely the
actual number of measles cases is much greater. The number of cases already
apparent is indicative of an impending epidemic. Previous experience
indicates that the months of March and April have been the most favourable
period for the spread of this childhood illness.

The most significantly affected places are the health districts of Dougoy,
Djarengol-Kodek, Domayo I and II, Lopere, and Ouro Tchede. Other individual
cases are distributed across the far north region of the country
[Extreme-Nord province]. The extent of the outbreak is still being assessed
as all the available data have yet to collated.
