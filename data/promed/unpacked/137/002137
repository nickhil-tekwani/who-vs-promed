An outbreak of mumps has been registered among local school children
in Novokomissarovka village in the Dubosar district of Pridnestrovye.
It was recognized simultaneously in 3 children, one of whom suffered
complications. According to public health physician Valeriy
Pishnograev, as the incubation period for mumps is 23 days, the
school will be closed for a quarantine period. After the spring
break, children will be allowed to return to school only after
medical check-up by an infectious diseases specialist.

Since the beginning of the year [2008], 19 people have been infected
with mumps in the Dubosar district. The local infectious diseases
doctors are assuming that mumps has spread to the Pridnestrovye
region from Moldavia [outside of Russia, usually rendered as Moldova
- Mod.CP]. Already by December 2007, the disease had become
widespread. Most of the infected were young people 14-20 years of
age. In Moldavia, since the beginning of 2008, 1200 cases of mumps
have been registered, whereas in 2006, there were only 96 cases.
According to experts, this is a consequence of the fact that many
people were not vaccinated in the 1980's.

[Pridnestrovye is a disputed territory whose status is presently a
matter of negotiation between Russia and the Republic of Moldova
(see: <http://news.rin.ru/eng/news///8904/1//>). According to
Wikipedia, the territory is currently administered by an unrecognized
breakaway authority under the name Pridnestrovian Moldovan Republic.
The mumps outbreak described in this report is part of a larger
outbreak affecting the whole region (see references below).
