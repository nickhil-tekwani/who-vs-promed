Hundreds of cattle in Takalar anthrax positive
----------------------------------------------
More than 100 domestic cattle and water buffaloes in 2 villages in Takalar have succumbed to anthrax. The animals suffered convulsions before they died. The cases occurred in Laikang and Punaga village in Mangarabombang subdistrict, Takalar district, South Sulawesi. The disease was confirmed through laboratory testing in Maros Disease Investigation Center. Testing found the causative bacteria, _Bacillus anthracis_, in spleen and blood samples.

Within the last 2 months, more than 170 cattle and buffaloes [have] died in both villages. The district government of Takalar has [confirmed the] outbreak.

The government has also released instructions to isolate livestock within the 2 villages. Strict measures are being taken to prevent the disease from spreading to other villages. The 2 villages are prohibited from sending out cattle and water buffaloes from the village. They are also not allowed to receive animals from other areas, said the head of the Livestock Division in Takalar Agriculture and Forestry Services, Muhammad Ridwan Ghani, on Tuesday (5 Jun 2012).

He warned farmers to not eat their animals until there is further treatment and vaccination. This disease is very dangerous and could be transmitted to people.

"Most likely bacterial spores are present in the soil and could survive up to 40 to 60 years. From time to time it could be activated and attack people," said Felisia Mira, a veterinarian at Takalar Agriculture and Forestry Services.

The head of Turikale subvillage in Laikang village, Bakkang Daeng Nai, confirmed the incident. 3 of his own cattle have died from anthrax. "It has never happened like this before. Usually whenever there is disease, it would be cured after [they are given an injection. Now the cattle immediately die," said Bakkang.

[Our thanks to Andri for forwarding this report to us and its translation. Much appreciated.

The disease has been a constant in Sulawesi Selatan (South Sulawesi) since 1998, each year with significant losses reported in cattle; they probably occur in other species but evade reporting. It was not reported in this part of Indonesia to OIE in 2011. This report lists no human cases but human anthrax is common in Indonesia; in 2011 there was a total of 41 human anthrax cases in Indonesia ... one of the highest rates in the world.
