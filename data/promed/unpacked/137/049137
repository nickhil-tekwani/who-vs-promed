While conducting a literature review on future directions of vaccination
against Japanese encephalitis virus, particularly from the Australian
perspective, I wondered about the very question posed by the Moderator
("Does anyone know whether Japanese encephalitis virus vaccine protects
against infection with Murray Valley encephalitis virus?") in the posting
"Arboviral encephalitis - Australia (NT) [archived reference above.
While there is no specific research published on the matter, there has been
some speculation in the literature since MVE virus is the closest relative
of JEV. There have been suggestions that prior exposure to MVE virus
provides some cross-reactive protection against JEV (see refs 1-4 below),
but this is likely to be inadequate in preventing the onset of disease.
