EPPO Report 2001/027 - First report of tomato chlorosis crinivirus in
Puerto Rico
---------------------------------------------
In Puerto Rico, symptoms of interveinal chlorosis, necrotic flecking,
thickening and rolling of leaves were observed on field-grown tomato
plants. In samples collected from 2 symptomatic plants, characteristic
particles of criniviruses were observed (long flexuous rods approximately
800 nm in length). Molecular assays and transmission studies using
whiteflies revealed the presence of tomato chlorosis crinivirus [ToCV
(EPPO Alert List) in symptomatic tomato plants. This is the first report of
ToCV in Puerto Rico, and in the Caribbean [region. The situation of ToCV
in Puerto Rico can be described as: Present: no details.

[ToCV is a member of the Closteroviridae. Not much is known about its
economic impact on tomato production. Do any of our subscribers have
information on this point? According to an earlier report (Wisler et al.,
1998, PLANT DISEASE 82 (3):270-280), 4 whitefly species (greenhouse
whitefly [_Trialeurodes vaporariorum_, banded whitefly [_T. abutilonea_,
sweet potato whitefly [_Bemisia tabaci_ biotype A, and silverleaf whitefly
[_B. tabaci_, biotype B are vectors of this virus, thus increasing the
potential for this virus to be spread widely in the Caribbean region
outside of the United States. - Mod.DH
