Several Southeast Asian countries are seeing record numbers of people infected with dengue fever, a mosquito-borne virus for which there is currently no approved vaccine or specific drug treatment, local media said.

More than 40 000 people in Thailand's capital Bangkok are suffering from the world's fastest spreading tropical disease, while up to 150 000 people nationwide may have come down with the virus since the beginning of the year [2013], the National News Bureau in Thailand (NNT) said on Tuesday [25 June 2013]. According to officials, 50 people have died in Thailand from the fever.

In Laos, 44 people have died and more than 11 000 people have come down with the virus since the start of 2013, raising concerns that the number of infections could exceed the 2010 record of 23 000 infections and 46 deaths, according to the Thai daily newspaper, The Nation.

Channel News Asia said the city-state of Singapore had also recorded more than 11 000 cases so far this year [2013], including 853 cases in the past week alone, an all-time high. So far, 2 people have died.

In Myanmar, the health authorities warned last week [week of 17 Jun 2013] that the country could be in the grip of a dengue fever epidemic with the number of reported cases this year [2013] already surpassing that of the whole of 2012, the Burmese Irrawaddy website said.

It quoted Myanmar's ministry of health as saying 6448 people have been infected so far and 13 patients have died. In 2012, the ministry recorded 6033 dengue fever cases and 27 deaths.

Malaysia is also seeing an increase in cases. The World Health Organisation's (WHO) update on [13 Jun 2013] shows a caseload of 10 401 cases, compared to 10 352 for the same period last year [2012].

A total of 22 people, including 2 toddlers, have so far died of the virus, Malaysian news outlet, The Star, said.

In April [2013], experts said around 390 million people are infected with dengue fever each year, more than triple WHO's current estimate of 50-100 million a year.

Researchers from the University of Oxford and the Wellcome Trust estimated that 70 percent of the world's serious dengue cases were in Asia, with India alone accounting for 34 percent of the total.

The dengue virus is spread by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, which has grown rapidly along with urbanisation and globalisation because it thrives in tropical mega-cities and is easily spread in goods containing small puddles of water.

Climate change is also making more parts of the planet habitable for the dengue-spreading mosquito, experts say.

As a result, half the world's population is now exposed to the disease, mostly in the developing world -- but also in parts of southern Europe and the southern United States.

[2] Tanzania (Dar es Salaam)
Date: Fri 28 Jun 2013

The child of [GS] was suffering from high fever which, initially, she suspected to be malaria, a disease endemic in Dar es Salaam city. She decided to go to a nearby drug store to buy malaria tablets, which she administered to her child, but the child did not respond to treatment.

[GS] was surprised. At first she thought her child had been bewitched and wanted to turn to a witchdoctor. But when she sought the advice of her husband, he decided that they see a medical doctor.

At the hospital, the doctor said diagnosis had shown that the child had contracted a little known disease called "dengue fever" whose symptoms very much resembled those of malaria. The symptoms of the disease include fever, headache, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin rash that is similar to measles. Dengue fever, also known as breakbone fever, is an infectious tropical disease caused by the dengue virus.

When Tanzanian health care authorities launched an investigation into the outbreak of the disease in the city, it came to light that 20 people had been infected with the disease. A statement by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare said the confirmation was made on [12 Jun 2013], after dengue fever suspects were referred to the laboratory of the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR) in Dar es Salaam for screening.

The screening exercise was headed by a panel of medical researchers from the ministry in collaboration with health experts from the Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Programme and Ilala Municipal Council, said the ministry's deputy director of health services (intervention), Ms Janeth Mgamba. Following this discovery, the ministry was duty-bound to alert members of the public to dengue fever outbreak in the country so that they could take control as well as preventive measures.

Apart from Tanzania, earlier this year [2013], dengue outbreaks have been reported in Somalia and in neighbouring Kenya where the majority of cases were pinpointed in the Indian Ocean coastal town of Mombasa. Health authorities in Tanzania have become increasingly concerned with an apparent rise in the cases of dengue fever in the country, especially in Dar es Salaam and neighbouring areas.

Cases are also increasing in Zanzibar. The ministry responsible for health has thus appealed to members of the public who have developed malaria-like symptoms to report to health facilities in their localities for diagnosis of dengue fever or DHF as a measure to contain the outbreak.

As there is no available vaccine against the disease, members of the public are advised to take control measures, which include reducing the habitat and the number of mosquitoes and limiting exposure to bites as well as using appropriate clothing. Currently vector control is the available method for the dengue and DHF prevention and control while research on dengue vaccines for public health use is in process, says WHO.

[Although there have been several reports of dengue virus in East Africa (1), there is a dearth of literature on dengue fever transmission in Tanzania. However, a report by Moi (2010) documented 2 cases of dengue virus type 3 genotype III among travellers returning to Japan from Tanzania in 2010 (2). The current newswire therefore confirms dengue virus transmission has reached epidemic levels in Dar es Salaam, prompting national authorities to initiate the corresponding surveillance and response interventions to control and prevent further transmission.

[This is the 1st dengue case reported in Nepal since 2010. Assuming that the infection was locally acquired and not imported from India, there must be one other dengue virus infection there, and perhaps several more. The Dang district is in the southern Midwestern Region of Nepal, bordering Uttar Pradesh, India, and may be warm enough to support _Aedes aegypti_ vector mosquito populations.
