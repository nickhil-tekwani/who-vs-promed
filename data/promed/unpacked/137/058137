Research article: Risk factors for MERS Coronavirus infection in dromedary camels in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia and Morocco, 2015
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Miguel E, Chevalier V, Ayelet G, et al.

Summary
-------
Understanding Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) transmission in dromedary camels is important, as they constitute a source of zoonotic infection to humans. To identify risk factors for MERS-CoV infection in camels bred in diverse conditions in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia and Morocco, blood samples and nasal swabs were sampled in February-March 2015. A relatively high MERS-CoV RNA rate was detected in Ethiopia (up to 15.7 percent; 95 percent confidence interval (CI): 8.2-28.0), followed by Burkina Faso (up to 12.2 percent; 95 percent CI: 7-20.4) and Morocco (up to 7.6 percent; 95 percent CI: 1.9-26.1). The RNA detection rate was higher in camels bred for milk or meat than in camels for transport (p = 0.01) as well as in younger camels (p = 0.06). High seropositivity rates (up to 100 percent; 95 percent CI: 100-100 and 99.4 percent; 95 percent CI: 95.4-99.9) were found in Morocco and Ethiopia, followed by Burkina Faso (up to 84.6 percent; 95 percent CI: 77.2-89.9). Seropositivity rates were higher in large/medium herds (greater than or equal to 51 camels) than small herds (p = 0.061), in camels raised for meat or milk than for transport (p = 0.01), and in nomadic or sedentary herds than in herds with a mix of these lifestyles (p less than 0.005).

[The published report of the international research project is a timely effort to decipher the MERS enigma, namely the scarcity, or apparent absence, of human MERS cases in countries outside the Arabian Peninsula in spite of serologically demonstrated evidence of the corona virus activity in their respective dromedary camel populations. Such situation has been recorded also in other countries (eg, Israel). Even within the Arabian peninsula, there are still numerous primary cases in which the source of infection could not be demonstrated.

The following excerpts from the discussion section of the above research paper include some interesting observations (for the mentioned tables and references, please refer to the full paper at the source URL):

"There is an apparent gradient of virus RNA positivity adjusted for age (Table 3) from west to east which could be explained by a gradient in camel density (Figure 1A), in addition to other drivers such as climate, migratory roads and national and international camel exchanges. Since Ethiopia is a main exporter to the Arabian Peninsula through 2 main ports in Djibouti and Somalia [35], the virus transmission dynamics in this region is of particular interest.

We observed an increase in seropositivity rate with age which confirms the trend observed in Ethiopia in a previous study [20]. We found a higher virus RNA detection rate in young animals compared with older animals which could be related to a lack of prior immunity as published in previous studies in Saudi Arabia [36]. Young animals were naive and more susceptible to virus infection". ------

----- "Camels raised for milking (which are females) show the highest serological prevalence followed by camels raised for their meat (which are mostly males) and lastly, camels used for transport activities (which are also mostly males), which have the lowest seroprevalence (Table 3 and model selection). The higher seropositivity rate in females bred for milking could be related to the high viral RNA detection rates in younger animals, e.g. calves [37]. A plausible hypothesis could indeed be that young camels who lack antibodies have a high probability of being infected and in turn expose the mothers to infection or reinfection. The lower seropositivity rate in camels bred for their meat or for transport activities, which are mostly males, could also be linked with the fact that males are often separated from the herd (the 2 sexes are only mixed during the reproduction activities) and have thus less contacts with other camels (i.e. females and calves)".

As indicated in the paper, the survey was limited to a narrow period in time, February-March 2015, and does not provide insights into seasonal variation in epidemiological dynamics. Hopefully, research efforts addressing the One Health aspects of MERS and its epidemiology, within and beyond the Arabian peninsula, will gain support and be forcefully continued. - Mod.AS
