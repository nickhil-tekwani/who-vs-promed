A male German tourist visited Little Koh Chang Island (Andaman Sea, Thailand) from 25 Dec 2019 to 20 Jan 2020.

Starting 21 Jan 2020 onwards he complained about intermittent fever and headache. On 24 Jan 2020, he presented at the Division for Tropical Medicine and Infectious Diseases in Munich, Germany. At presentation, the patient was afebrile, and the commercial malaria rapid test was negative.

However, malaria was diagnosed using thin smear microscopy. Parasitaemia was below 0.1%; a species diagnoses could not be made by microscopy. A differential malaria PCR revealed _Plasmodium knowlesi_ infection. The further clinical course was uncomplicated; the patient was treated successfully with atovaquone and proguanil.

We have seen and reported a similar case of _P. knowlesi_ malaria acquired on that same island before (see reference below), an island that is currently defined as a low-risk area.

We'd like to emphasize this specific part of Thailand as an area of potential _P. knowlesi_ infections and want to stress the importance of smear microscopy and differential PCR in diagnosing this type of malaria, as rapid tests are negative in _P. knowlesi_ infection.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Claudia Wallrauch for reporting this case. Infection with _Plasmodium knowlesi_ is a problem in southeast Asia. The infection evolves rapidly with the parasite having a 24-h asexual life-cycle in the human host.

As pointed out by Dr. Wallrauch, the rapid test was negative, and it is important to know that the rapid tests are validated only for _P. falciparum_ and _P. vivax_ infections. Most rapid tests also include a test for a "pan-malaria antigen" supposed to catch _P. ovale_, _P. malariae_ and _P. knowlesi_, but the tests are not validated for these infections; thus, the detection level, i.e., the parasite counts where the tests become positive, are not known. - Mod.EP
