We have report of the following number of statutorily notifiable cases in Portugal for the most recent years:

2016 - Data not available yet
2015 - 1 case
2014 - 7 cases
2013 - 2 cases

These cases are reported through the ICD codes corresponding to CFP. But we have no further confirmation or details on cases (and no lab test is available to detect in humans, so diagnosis is only clinical).

Lab confirmed fish caught in the "Selvagens" islands (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savage_Islands), between Madeira and the Canary Islands has been reported (around 2008-2010) but we are unaware of any recent cases being detected. Also unaware if routine surveillance is implemented.
