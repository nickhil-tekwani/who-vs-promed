KALAHANDI, May 29: Spread of anthrax disease among cattle and livestock in
the tribal block of Lanjigarh has caused panic among people who claimed
that over 50 livestock had died during the past 2 weeks; 38 people had also
been affected with the disease but are all fast recovering. The disease is
said to have assumed an epidemic form among cattle in Lanjigarh, confirmed
veterinary department sources here. They informed that a medical team was
camping at Leptaguda village, which is worst-hit by the disease.
These sources informed that as many as 15 cattle, 8 sheep, 21 goats and
several pigs had died over the last 2 weeks. Leptaguda is a small village
with 250 families, mostly "kutia kandhs" who depend on shifting cultivation
and livestock living there.
Reports of the disease were received very late by the veterinary department
since the tribals believed it was a curse of nature due to which the
animals were dying suddenly. Chief district veterinary officer, Dr BB
Samal, said that a medical team had been camping in the area and
vaccinating the remaining livestock to prevent further spread of the
disease. Dr Samal informed that the Lanjigarh block has been
anthrax-endemic for a long time.
It also afflicts human beings who come in contact with or consume meat of
affected livestock. In humans it starts with ulcers in the fingers and
upper limbs, he added.
At Leptaguda, 35 persons and at Bundel village 3 people were detected [with
the infection and they are under treatment, said chief district medical
officer Dr Amaresh Pradhan. He added that the patients had ulcers which
were now healing.

[Humans get cutaneous anthrax when cuts are exposed to infected matter, in
this case blood, while butchering sick and dead animals. If there were no
deaths, it is probable that there were no gastroenteric cases. It is highly
probable that there were other livestock cases in the area in adjoining
herds and wildlife, if this large number of animals were affected in such a
short period. Let us hope that the dead stock were burnt. In India it seems
that vaccination programmes are erratic at present, making control
difficult if not ineffective. - Mod.MHJ
