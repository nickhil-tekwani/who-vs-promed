The Botswana Meat Commission (BMC) chief executive Motshudi
Raborokgwe said the shut-down of the abattoirs in Francistown and
Lobatse would seriously affect exports to the European Union and
other major markets, and could even threaten the survival of the beef
industry. Raborokgwe said the BMC had been forced to recall 6
containers of beef en route to Europe, Reunion and South Africa.
The latest FMD outbreak was detected early last week in the Bobonong
communal lands on the frontier with Zimbabwe. According to a notice
issued by Musa Fanakiso, director of veterinary services, it is
concentrated in the southeast of the country, a major beef producing
area with an estimated 100 000 cattle.
"Until further notice, the movement of all cloven-hoofed animals in
and out of the specified area is prohibited except in accordance with
a permit issued by a veterinary officer," the statement said. The
traditional response to foot-and-mouth is quarantine and the
destruction of suspected infected herds.
Botswana's recent FMD outbreaks [see ProMED-mail posting
20050304.0665 - Mod.PC] have been linked to neighbouring Zimbabwe. A
shortage of dipping chemicals there, and the break-up of the large
commercial farms and loss of fencing, has allowed the disease to
spread. It is endemic among wildlife like buffalo.
The current crisis has again been linked to Zimbabwe, which 3 weeks
ago was forced to close its main abattoir while veterinary officers
struggle to contain the disease. This outbreak was first reported at
a cattle-fattening farm about 30 km northeast of the capital, Harare.
Cross-border cattle rustling and unofficial trade between local
communities have in the past led to the spread of FMD into Botswana.
