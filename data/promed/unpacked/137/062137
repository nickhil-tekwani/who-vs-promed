Saint Paul International Airport (MSP), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers have identified a trend that could have deadly effects and lead to another outbreak of disease. The culprit is bushmeat.

The term "bushmeat" refers to raw and minimally processed meat that comes from wild animals in certain regions of the world including Africa and may pose communicable disease risk. Bushmeat comes from a variety of wild animals, including bats, nonhuman primates, cane rats (grasscutters) and antelope. Bushmeat is often smoked, dried, or salted, which are not procedures that render the meat noninfectious. Bushmeat could be infected with germs that can cause sickness in people including the Ebola virus.

Since late December [2021], CBP Agriculture Specialists at MSP have observed U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents returning from Liberia and declaring fish only on their written and verbal declarations. Even when passengers are asked directly about bushmeat, they declare "fish." Inspections reveal more than fish. Most packages are wrapped in multiple layers of newspaper, plastic, foil, and tape. Chief Agriculture Specialist Lauren Lewis said, "the intermingling of fish and bushmeat in the same package is common."

During the last week of 2021, officers seized over 104 pounds [47 kg] of bushmeat. Due to the potential of foreign animal disease introduction, CBP agriculture specialists take the most restrictive action to remove such items from a traveler's baggage as an exact countermeasure in accordance with U.S. Department of Agriculture, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Fish and Wildlife regulations.

"Minnesota's CBP agriculture specialists are focused on their mission to prevent entry of prohibited items into the United States," said LaFonda D. Sutton-Burke, Director, Field Operations-Chicago. "The sheer volume of bushmeat our specialists intercept clearly shows how they play a critical role in preventing diseases from entering the United States."

"Just last week our agriculture specialists stopped a passenger returning from Liberia," said Augustine Moore, Area Port Director-Minnesota. When officers asked if he had any bushmeat, he said he had "parts of a monkey; turned out it was two primate arms and primate rib material."

Ebola is a rare and deadly disease that is spread through direct contact with the blood or body fluids or a person that is sick or died from Ebola. Generally, Ebola is not spread by food. However, in Africa, human infections have been associated with hunting, butchering, and processing of meat from infected animals.

[This situation is the tip of a very large iceberg, being passengers coming from one African country, Liberia, into one USA international airport, Minneapolis/St. Paul, during one week, the last week of December 2021 with 104 lbs (47 kg) of bushmeat. In 2013. It was estimated that 25 million kg (55 million lbs) of bushmeat arrives in the United States each year. The USA CDC states, "Bushmeat is raw or processed meat derived from wild animals, such as cane rats, duiker antelope, nonhuman primates, and bats. Many U.S. federal agencies have restrictions on the importation of bushmeat. Most bushmeat is illegal to ship, mail, or carry into the United States. Upon reaching the U.S. borders, bushmeat will be confiscated and destroyed. Persons who carry or import bushmeat may be fined." (https://www.cdc.gov/importation/animal-products.html).

Smuggled bushmeat has also been a problem in Europe. In 2018 a Belgian study estimated that an average of 3.7 tonnes of bushmeat is smuggled through Brussels airport from West and Central Africa each month. The study targeted flights from Sub-Saharan Africa over a 2-year period and searched all passengers' luggage for both bushmeat and domestic meat (livestock). The top 3 countries of origin were Congo (19 seizures), Cameroon (9 seizures) and Ivory Coast and Togo (both 5 seizures). Bushmeat involving 10 CITES-listed (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) species were identified, including primates, pangolins and crocodiles.

A 2012 pilot study of pathogens detected in bushmeat smuggled into the USA states, "Initial findings from samples collected at several international airports identified parts originating from nonhuman primate (NHP) and rodent species, including baboon, chimpanzee, mangabey, guenon, green monkey, cane rat and rat. Pathogen screening identified retroviruses (simian foamy virus) and/or herpesviruses (cytomegalovirus and lymphocryptovirus) in the NHP samples. These results are the 1st demonstration that illegal bushmeat importation into the United States could act as a conduit for pathogen spread, and suggest that implementation of disease surveillance of the wildlife trade will help facilitate prevention of disease emergence. (see PLoS One paper: "Zoonotic Viruses Associated with Illegally Imported Wildlife Products. By: Smith KM, Anthony SJ, Switzer WM, Epstein JH, Seimon T, et al. (2012) PLoS ONE 7(1): e29505. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0029505. http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0029505)

In his comments (in the post Bushmeat trade, disease transmission risk 20120112.1008373), Mod. CP continued, "The pathogen screening was based on sequence analysis and virus isolation was not attempted in this analysis. Only simian foamy viruses (SFV) and herpesviruses were detected in the nonhuman primate (NHP) bushmeat samples. All NHP samples were negative for SIV [simian immunodeficiency virus) and STLV (simian T-cell leukaemia virus) sequences. All rodent samples were negative for leptospira, anthrax, herpesviruses, filoviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses, flaviviruses, and orthopoxviruses. There were 3 genera of herpesvirus detected in NHP specimens, cytomegaloviruses (CMV; a betaherpesvirus) and lymphocryptoviruses (LCV; a gammaherpesvirus). Multiple viruses were detected within some samples."

Clearly, bushmeat trade is a major wildlife conservation threat. The degree to which it is a public or animal health threat has not been adequately studied. Bushmeat confiscated at international ports of entry is promptly destroyed. Additional studies to detect pathogens of human or animal health significance would be of interest. Prohibition of hunting of animals for bushmeat and its subsequent trade would be culturally and economically difficult. For some individuals, it is the only available source of affordable animal protein. The national and international bushmeat trade has strong economic elements as a source of income. Eliminating these economic incentives would require cultural changes and appropriate laws with their enforcement in the countries of origin. This seems unlikely in the near future. - Mod.TY
