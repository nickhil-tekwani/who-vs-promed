According to The Times, 3 October, 1997, Jack Cunningham, UK Minister of
Agriculture, announced to the Labour Party Conference that "It is time to
take a fresh look at our quarantine laws. But any new system must be as
effective in protecting the British people as the system we have had in
place for most of this century." He has set up an independent review panel
to review the anti-rabies controls. This panel will be headed by Ian
Kennedy, Professor of Health Law, Ethics & Policy, University College,
London. The panel is not expected to make its recommendations before early
1998, which will then be followed by a further period of public
consultation. Thus any new system would not be implemented before the
second half of 1998 at the earliest.
Cunningham is said to favour scrapping quarantine only for pets moving
between Britain and the other EU countries and the European Free Trade
Association, plus a few other countries deemed to be rabies-free, such as
Australia & New Zealand. The account did not mention USA and Canada. The
panel is expected to look very closely at the successful Swedish system
introduced in 1994, based on vaccination and blood tests.
The review is welcomed by the RSPCA and 'Passports for Pets'. Owners of
quarantine kennels/catteries have called for compensation if the present
law is changed. Such a kennel owner has stated, "It would be brutal if the
Government simply pulled the rug out from under people who have invested
their life savings in providing these facilities."
[It is pleasant to see the present UK Government moving with such
confidence. MHJ
