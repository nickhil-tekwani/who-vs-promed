Federal health officials are trying to determine how guests at a May
convention were stricken by an intestinal parasite uncommon in the United
States.
Scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will survey
250 attendees of a mid-May event at a hotel to trace the source
of the parasite _Cyclospora cayetanensis_.
Health officials say eight cases of the parasite have been confirmed. In
all, 24 people say they fell ill after the meeting, but health officials
have not confirmed if all contracted the parasite.
On 11 June [1999, the Los Angeles County Health Department received its
first
report of a problem from a man who had developed severe diarrhea. The man
was among a 40-member party from California, about half of which became
sick, said Dr Jean Malecki, director of the Palm Beach County Health
Department. Health officials in Wisconsin also reported four convention
attendees from the state developed similar symptoms.
Twenty-eight states were represented at the convention.
Investigators are focusing their probe on fresh produce imported from
foreign farms because cyclospora is not typically found in the United
States, Malecki said.
The parasite latches on to the intestine and -- after lying dormant for up
to
two weeks -- can cause diarrhea, nausea, cramping, fatigue, appetite loss
and
weight loss. The ill are being treated with antibiotics, Malecki said.
