The Assam government has cancelled all leaves of doctors, para-medical staff, and surveillance workers in order to deal with an outbreak of encephalitis that has claimed 49 lives across the state since January [2019].

In an order issued by the Health and Family Welfare Department on Saturday [6 Jul 2019], all leaves of the government medical staff in the state were cancelled "in order to effectively deal with the present situation of rising AES/JE cases."

To deal with the rising number of cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) and Japanese encephalitis (JE), the government has decided to involve the private hospitals.

"Critical AES/JE patients, who are admitted in the ICUs of private hospitals/nursing homes ... will be extended a monetary support of up to Rs 1 lakh [USD 146]," the order stated.

At least 49 deaths and 190 positive cases were reported due to Japanese encephalitis till 5 Jul [2019] from January this year [2019].

[A 7 Jul 2019 report indicates that the death toll has just risen to 50 (https://nenow.in/health/assam-japanese-encephalitis-death-toll-rises-to-50.html).

The numbers of reported JE cases in Assam state continue to increase from 45 deaths to 49 and 190 cases positive for JE. This is the active JE virus transmission season there, so health officials are prudent to evaluate the situation and take measures to reduce incidence of the disease, because more cases can be expected. Interestingly, although AES is mentioned, all of the 190 positive cases are attributed to JE, and the number of AES cases, if any, is not mentioned, although the above report does indicate that the number of AES cases is rising.

Immunization is the effective measure needed to avoid JE infections. Mosquito vector control is difficult. The previous report indicated that health officials had reviewed the immunization status but not stated of whom or what the findings were. It seems curious that no mention is made above of renewing vaccinations in the affected areas. Vaccination for JE was carried out in the affected areas last year (2018). It is not mentioned whether vaccination was carried out again this year (2019). The type of JE vaccine used previously is also not mentioned. If it is an inactivated vaccine, the duration of immunity may not be long-lasting. Attenuated live vaccine would provide longer immunity. - Mod.TY
