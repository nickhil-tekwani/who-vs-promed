According to the television network, Imedi, several months ago a wandering
dog bit a man in Rustavi. The man didn't seek medical attention and died at
the Tbilisi infectious diseases hospital, late in the evening of 21 Jun
2007. Doctors say that the patient developed all the signs of the disease,
such as hydrophobia and aerophobia. The condition of the patient worsened
gradually and eventually he died.

The Interfax agency reports that, according to Rospotrebnadzor [Territorial
Directorate of the Federal Services for Consumer Protection and Human
Welfare], the number of rabid animals in the Rostov region has doubled.
Since the beginning of 2007, 45 laboratory-confirmed cases of rabies have
been registered. In particular, the number of rabies cases among wild
carnivores increased 4-fold [compared with the same period last year
(2006)? otherwise? - Mod.AS]. Rabies was detected in 17 foxes, 3 wolves,
and one raccoon dog. The most affected areas are the city of Rostov on Don,
and the Tselinskiy, Zavetinskiy, Sholokhovskiy, Salskiy, Dubovskiy,
Belokalitvinskiy, Millerovskiy, and Semikarakorskiy regions.

Each year, more than 100 000 people consult health care facilities
[following suspected exposure to rabies] because of animal bites. Of these,
60 per cent [receive post exposure treatment].
So far this year [2007], 4 fatal cases of rabies have been registered. The
patients applied [for treatment while already showing clinical] signs of
rabies. Most infections are caused by wild animal bites (wolves and foxes,
41 per cent) or domestic animal bites (cats, 22 per cent; dogs, 15 per
cent), as well as farm animal bites (20 per cent).
The main sign of the disease in animals is the change of behavior, firstly
the loss of fear. The last fatal case was recorded in Donetsk, when a child
died. Nobody was able to say where, when, or with which animal the child
had contact.
