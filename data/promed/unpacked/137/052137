Thailand to host Asia-wide bird flu meeting in late November
---------------------------------------------------
Thailand will host a regional conference on bird flu next month to
assess how best to stem the spread of a virus which has killed at
least 30 people in Asia since December [2003], a government
spokeswoman said on Wednesday [13 Oct 2004].
The ministerial-level meeting is to take place 25-26 Nov 2004, with
Thai Health Minister Sudarat Keyuraphan inviting Malaysian officials
to the conference on Wednesday during talks between the two nations'
prime ministers.
"Sudarat asked Malaysia to join a ministerial meeting on health and
social response to and prevention of the avian flu epidemic," deputy
government spokeswoman Sansanee Nakpong told AFP. "Thailand will
invite Southeast Asian and Asia-Pacific countries."
6 Asian nations have reported a resurgence of the virus, prompting
the culling of millions of birds amid fears that the disease has
become endemic in the region.
Thai officials in late September confirmed the country's 1st probable
case of human-to-human infection of bird flu following the deaths of
a mother and daughter, which took the year's toll to 30.
The announcement raised fears that the bird flu virus could mutate
into a highly contagious form and trigger a global human flu pandemic.
A mutated bird flu outbreak was blamed for the deaths of as many as
40 million people worldwide in 1918. [That figure is rather
speculative: estimates vary between 20 and 50 million victims of
1918's "Spanish flu". In assessing the risks of a new pandemic, one
should take into consideration that the world population, which was
about 1.8 billion in 1918, has more than tripled in the intervening
years.- Mod.AS]
Last week ministers from 10 Southeast Asian nations agreed to form a
task force to help co-ordinate efforts to tackle bird flu.
