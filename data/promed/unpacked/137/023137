As many as 15 persons of Kuanrmunda block of Sundargarh district have been diagnosed with deadly anthrax disease, and the district administration deputed a medical team to the spot on Friday [13 Jul 2018]. The medical team, besides offering treatment to the affected persons, issued an advisory notice to the locals, requesting them not to eat flesh of any deceased animal.

Sources said about 11 persons of Ganju tolla under Raiboga police station area of Sundargarh district and 4 persons from Thangdinacha village under Biramitrapur police station have been confirmed having the dreaded anthrax. These persons had eaten flesh of a dead animal a few days ago. Following confirmation, a 6-member medical team under the leadership of additional district public health officer SK Rath reached the spot and offered treatment to the affected persons.

Sources said all the affected persons have complained of infection in their skin. The medical team claimed their condition was stable. "Since the infection has not affected the lungs of the patients, they will recover soon," said chief district medical officer, Sundargarh Uday Bhanu Das.

[They were very lucky they did not develop gastro-intestinal anthrax. That kills, and quickly and painfully. These 15 individuals developed cutaneous lesions from merely handling the contaminated meat. As they came from 2 villages, one group had purchased the meat in a street market and not from a neighbour. Fortunately, the meat was over-cooked, thereby killing the anthrax spores. If one insists on eating contaminated meat, never use a chef.

Odisha is in northeast India, and livestock and human anthrax is, unfortunately, not uncommon there. To find Odisha, go to: https://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/india_physio-2001.jpg. - Mod.MHJ
