Yellow rust attacks wheat crop
------------------------------
After attacking wheat in Haryana, yellow rust has now appeared in Punjab with detection of 2 such cases. In its latest survey, Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) found the disease attacking crops in Ropar [Rupnagar] district. Another detection was made at Hoshiarpur [district].

Karnal-based Directorate of Wheat Research (DWR) had found high intensity attacks of yellow rust in Yamunanagar district of Haryana. Last year [2013], yellow rust spread over 1000 hectares [2471 acres] of land in Yamunanagar, causing extensive damage to winter crops.

PAU advised wheat growers to be proactive and monitor their fields regularly. Notably, farmers in sub-mountainous districts of Punjab are advised to be extra careful and take timely control measures in order to check the spread of disease to other areas.

Farm experts have also said that current weather conditions are congenial for spreading of the disease and it has the potential to spread from unrecommended varieties to even recommended varieties of wheat.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. The disease affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale, and a number of wild grasses. It causes yellow leaf stripes and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100 percent in wheat.

Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season. Between seasons, the fungus survives on living host plants generating a "green bridge". Disease management includes the use of resistant varieties, fungicide applications, and control of volunteer crops.

New stripe rust strains with increased virulence are emerging worldwide. These include strains that show additional fungicide resistances and/or new "virulences" (ability to break down disease resistance conferred by specific host genes). Monitoring and resistance breeding programmes have been established in different regions for early detection of new rust strains and to attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution.

In India, the emergence of a new strain was confirmed in Punjab and Himachal Pradesh in 2009 and a change of wheat cultivars was recommended to farmers (see ProMED-mail post 20090329.1216). Further outbreaks have occurred since then (see previous ProMED-mail posts listed below), and it is not clear whether this is due to the new varieties not being planted or whether additional fungal strains have emerged.
