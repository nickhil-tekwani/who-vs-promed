Russia: Seasonal Increase in Hemorrhagic Fever in Ulyanovsk
---------------------------------------------------
In Ulyanovsk there has been a marked increase in the number of cases of
mouse fever [hantavirus infection?]. According to the Sanitary
Epidemiological Surveillance Center, 17 people were admitted to the
hospital at the beginning of November with the symptoms of this disease,
whereas only 18 cases had been reported during the whole year up to that
time. According to health specialists, this is the normal pattern, and they
predicted that an increased number of cases would be observed until the end
of December.
Mice are the principal carriers of the disease. Most of those infected are
men who had contact with rodents. The disease is characterized by acute
fever, dry cough, and short-term vision weakness. Medical attention should
be sought as soon as symptoms develop; otherwise the disease can be fatal.

[It is presumed that the "mouse fever" refers to hantavirus infection,
since the report is headed "hemorrhagic fever." The seasonal pattern of
infection would be consistent with build-up of mouse populations, although
rather late in the year. Further information would be appreciated to
clarify the situation. - Mod.CP]
