Bird flu in Portugal
--------------------
The H5N2 virus was discovered in 2 farms that rear ducks in Vila Nova da
Barquinha and in Tomar. The Ministry of Agriculture assures that all the
infected birds have been killed. The farms are free range, though, which
makes it impossible to know how many animals may have been in contact with
the disease.
The H5N2 strain is considered to have a low pathogenicity, making it less
dangerous. Nevertheless the authorities have placed both farms under the
surveillance of the Bird Flu Vigilance Plan.

[It is important and also required to report all H5 and H7 strains of avian
influenza to OIE. The low pathogenicity strains do not cause anywhere near
as great a problem as do the highly pathogenic strains. Actions are usually
taken to prevent H5N2 low pathogenic strains from evolving into highly
pathogenic strains which can occur if low pathogenic strains are allowed to
continue to circulate in particular populations. - Mod.PC]
