[Before presenting the summary of the status of reported cases of influenza
A (H1N1) infection as of 10 May 2009 it is important to mention that many
of the reporting units did not have reports from today (10 May 2009) so it
is highly likely that there may be a backlog of specimens to be processed
on 11 May 2009 that may result in an "artificial" increase in reports as
this backlog is processed on 11 May 2009.

To summarize the current situation, as of 10 May 2009 a total of 4379 cases
and 49 deaths of influenza A (H1N1) infection have been officially reported
to WHO/PAHO from 29 countries, up from 3440 confirmed cases and 48 deaths
from 29 countries yesterday (9 May 2009). There are no newly added
countries in the past 24 hours. According to newswires published on 9 May
2009 there is a confirmed case in Norway, and newswires published on 10 May
2009 mention a confirmed case in mainland China.

The USA has officially reported 2532 laboratory confirmed cases coming from
44 states (compared with 2254 cases from 44 states on 9 May 2009), and 3
deaths (one in a Mexican child with pre-existing illness visiting in the
USA, a 2nd in a resident of Texas with known pre-existing illness, and a
3rd in Washington State with known pre-existing illness). Canada has
reported 284 cases from 9 provinces with 1 death in an individual with
pre-existing illness, up from 280 cases and one death reported from 9
provinces on 9 May 2009. Mexico has reported 2062 confirmed cases with 48
deaths (compared with 1626 cases and 48 deaths on 9 May 2009.
