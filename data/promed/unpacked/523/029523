The Voronezh region [Oblast] in central Russia is once again seeing
an epidemic of hemorrhagic fever, this time affecting the kidneys
[i.e. haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome or HFRS)]. 50 people in
the region have contracted the illness, Russia's Itar-Tass [News
Agency] reported on Wed 27 Dec 2006. The press service of the
regional Health Department said that the disease has been recorded in
[all] the region's 5 areas as well as in [the City of] Voronezh.
A large increase in the population of rodents, 10 times more than
previous years, preceded this latest outbreak. The increase in
rodents is connected to unseasonably warm weather in the region this
winter [leading to an abundant food supply].
HFRS is not rare in the Voronezh region. There was an epidemic in the
1960s as well as another 5 years ago, when 50 people were reported to
have contracted the fever.

[HFRS is an endemic disease in Russia and not normally reported in
detail. However, due to climatic conditions there has been a marked
increase in populations of the reservoir host and a corresponding
increase in the number of human cases which merits posting.
The Voronezh Oblast is located in central Russia. It is predominantly
rural in character with abundant tracts of forest which provide
favorable habitats for the principal rodent reservoir host -- the red
vole (_Clethrionomys glareolus_) -- responsible for transmission of
HFRS to the human population.
A detailed description of the haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome
(HFRS) group of clinically similar diseases caused by infection with
hantaviruses is available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/hfrs.htm>. The
hantaviruses responsible for HFRS belong to the family
_Bunyaviridae_. The virus responsible for these outbreaks of HFRS in
the Voronezh Oblast is likely to be a strain of _Puumala virus_.
A map of the Voronezh Oblast is available at
<http://www.russiatrek.com/r_voronezh.shtml>, and a photograph of the
red vole (_Clethrionomys glareolus_). is available at:
