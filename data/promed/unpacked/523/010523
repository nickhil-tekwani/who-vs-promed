The quote from Clinical Services Director Amber Frost, "Once you get it, you have it forever" would only be accurate for chronic infection of hepatitis B. If the article is indeed focusing on acute cases, then it does not acknowledge the relatively small number of adult acute cases that will develop chronic hepatitis B infection. Only 5-10 percent of adult acute cases will progress to chronic infection. The increase in hepatitis B cases, acute or chronic, is absolutely a cause for concern, but it can be expected that many of these cases will go on to resolve their acute infection.

Thanks for all the work you do! These posts are invaluable and so very appreciated.
