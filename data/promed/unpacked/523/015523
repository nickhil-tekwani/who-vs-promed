A 31yearold bird flu patient died on Wed 22 Apr 2009 at Arifin Achmad
hospital, Pekanbaru. He passed away after being treated intensively at a
special isolation room for bird flu suspected patients. According to
Azizman Saad -- head of Bird Flu Control Team Arifin Achmad Hospital -- the
death of the patient was due to sudden lung failure.

Azizman explained that the patient's body was treated according to the bird
flu suspect patient treatment protocol and covered with plastic and
sterilized. The body is not allowed to be opened. The victim's family has
brought their son's body to their hometown in Teluk Meranti, Kecamatan
Teluk Meranti, Kabupaten Pelalawan.

Up to the present moment, Arifin Achmad hospital is still waiting for blood
and throat swab samples test results.

This fatality is the 2nd bird flu suspect case recorded in Arifin Achmad
hospital within the latest month [April 2009]. Previously, a 2.5 year old
toddler died on 26 Mar 2009. Further blood tests showed a bird flu positive
result.

Bird flu in Riau continues to haunt local residents after the death of a
young boy last month [March 2009]. Arifin Achmad General Hospital in
Pekanbaru is now treating a new patient who has symptoms of the virus. Head
of the hospital's bird flu prevention team Azizman Saad said the 32 year
old patient had been suffering from high fever and breathing problems for
the past week. The patient, a resident of Palalalwan regency, was admitted
to hospital on Sunday [26 Apr 2009], Azizman said. "He is still suspected
of being infected with the virus and is currently being treated in an
isolation room," he said. To get information on his illness, the patient's
blood sample has been sent to the health research agency at the Health
Ministry in Jakarta, he said. "We will know the results tomorrow," Azizman
said.
