Re: PRO/AH/EDR> Schmallenberg virus - Europe (02): UK (England, Wales, Scotland) bovine'

Further to the above post, we would like to offer some further information, reported by the Surveillance Intelligence Unit of the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA).

Schmallenberg virus (SBV) was identified in the UK as a new and emerging pathogen of cattle and sheep in 2012, as part of the Europe-wide spread of this midge-borne Orthobunyavirus. Since then reported detections of SBV declined in GB as in Europe, and SBV is considered endemic. However, recent reports from mainland Europe during 2016 of recrudescence were followed by reports from GB of congenital deformities in lambs and calves (see the APHA Surveillance report in the Veterinary Record:
http://veterinaryrecord.bmj.com/content/179/22/565?ijkey=9BP1tLzrC1kVg&keytype=ref&siteid=bmjjournals.

In order to better understand the apparent increase in cases, APHA has encouraged submission of suspect SBV cases (both acute and congenital forms of the disease), and has also provided more information on SBV cases in lambs confirmed by APHA in England and Wales during December 2016 and January 2017. This information can be found on the APHA Vet Gateway website:
http://ahvla.defra.gov.uk/vet-gateway/schmallenberg/index.htm and will be updated to show new cases, by county, on a fortnightly basis.

[We are grateful to Dr Irvine and his colleagues for sharing with us the above update and links.

Sheep, due to their relatively short pregnancy (5 months, compared to 9 in cattle) will be the 1st to demonstrate deformed offspring following their exposure to the SBV during pregnancy - earlier than pregnant cows which have been simultaneously exposed to the virus. The current information on the observations in sheep may serve as a forecast of the appearance of deformed calves during the coming months.

The following data on SBV-affected lambs are derived from the APHA Vet Gateway website:
Confirmed SBV cases in lambs during winter 2016/17:
1. England: December 2016 - 7; January 2017 - 36; total - 43.
2. Wales: December 2016 - 2. January 2017 - 10. Total - 12.

The above figures are the totals; for the data per county, subscribers are referred to the mentioned link. - Mod.AS
