Viet Nam records its 2nd bird flu death this year [2010]. A 3-year-old
girl on Wednesday [17 Mar 2010] became the 2nd person to die of bird
flu this year [2010] in Viet Nam, a doctor said. The child succumbed
after about a week in a Ho Chi Minh City pediatric hospital with a
severe lung infection, said Phan Van Nghiem, of the city's health
department. The girl, from southern Binh Duong province, was Viet
Nam's 59th human fatality from bird flu, also known as H5N1.

A 38-year-old woman in southern Tien Giang province died from the
virus in late February [2010].

Viet Nam has the world's 2nd-highest bird flu death toll after
Indonesia, according to the World Health Organization.

The H5N1 virus typically spreads from birds to humans via direct
contact, but experts fear it could mutate into a form easily
transmissible between humans, with the potential to kill millions in a
pandemic.

[This case was reported earlier (see ProMED-mail archive no.
20100316.0846), but sadly, this child died after that report. It is
not clear from this report if the cause of death was only the virus
infection or was complicated by a secondary bacterial infection.
