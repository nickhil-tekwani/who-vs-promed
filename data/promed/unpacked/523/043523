I was at UCSD (University California at San Diego) in 1969, where Charlie
Davis was sorting through the mechanisms of induction of DIC [Disseminated
Intravascular Coagulopathy] in patients with _T. rhodesiense_ based on
observations by Elizabeth Barrett-Connor in a returning tourist.
The references below describe the phenomenon and the mechanisms. This has
been described since then in a number of patients but is worth knowing in a
wider audience and may be relevant to the non-clotting blood of the kangaroos.

experimental trypanosomiasis. J Clin Invest 1974; 53(5): 1359-67.

coagulation in trypanosomiasis. Arch Intern Med 1973; 131(4): 574-7.
