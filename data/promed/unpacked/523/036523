[All 6 birds (swans and ducks) were from Nuremberg. We have reports, cited
below, of a 2nd outbreak 180 km (about 112 mi) away. For a map of the
outbreak, please see the full OIE report referenced above.
We also know it is similar to the Qinghai strain previously found in wild
birds in Europe and other places. It is time to consider 2 very important
questions:
- what is the exact nature of the connection between the 2 sites in terms
of the chronology of events? and
- where did the virus reemerge from, since the last outbreak in Germany was
in August 2006? - Mod.PC]
