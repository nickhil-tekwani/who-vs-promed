Leaf rust is starting to pop up in hard red winter wheat in parts of
the Plains where harvest is just weeks away. Some varieties in
Oklahoma test plots are showing high susceptibility to the disease,
according to Oklahoma State University Extension wheat pathologist
Bob Hunger. But, it's been held to areas where the weather's favored
leaf rust's development. The disease thrives in wet.

"One report I received from near Hinton, Oklahoma indicated that leaf
rust in unsprayed fields of Jagger was covering the flag leaves,"
Hunger says. "Similar reports of severe leaf rust have come from the
experiment station at Lahoma." Not all varieties are affected by leaf
rust, however. Hunger says the varieties showing highest levels of
susceptibility right now are Jagalene, Jagger, and Lakin.

"The earlier leaves are lost, the more severe the yield loss. Losses
may vary depending on the variety's ability to fill from the stem,
glumes, and awns," Kansas State University Extension plant
pathologist Robert Bowden says. "Susceptible varieties can be
protected from rust with foliar fungicides. Although systemic
fungicides can give very good control of leaf rust, they are
relatively expensive, and use is limited to fields with high yield
and disease potentials."

In diagnosing leaf rust in the field, Bowden says to look for orange
pustules on the leaf surface, sometimes surrounded by a "narrow
yellow or white halo. When rust severity is high, field scouts may
notice the orange dust on hands and clothing," he adds. "Leaf rust
typically occurs uniformly across a field. In overwintering
locations, it is most severe on the bottom leaves. When it blows in
from distant fields, it will be most severe on upper leaves."

Currently, leaf rust has been found at low levels at the Hays
Agricultural Research Center. However, reports from the south-central
part of Kansas and Oklahoma are seeing leaf rust increasing
significantly, especially with the moist conditions they are
experiencing. It is critical to scout fields routinely a minimum of
twice a week until the crop has fully headed.

Leaf rust favors warmer weather with some humidity. Currently, the
weather conditions in Ellis County and the area are very favorable
for a possibly huge outbreak of leaf rust within the next week or so.
The most effective fungicide sprays are applied between flag leaf
emergence through heading. Yield responses can be greater than 20
percent in fields where leaf rust arrives prior to flowering.

Some leaf rust was observed even on Post Rock, which has a high
resistance rating for leaf rust, so all wheat varieties and fields
should be scouted often for the detection of leaf rust.

[Leaf rust, also called brown rust, on wheat is caused by the fungus
_Puccinia recondita_. It reduces the photosynthetic potential of the
plant and can cause serious yield losses of over 40 percent in
individual fields. Symptoms include brick-red pustules on leaves,
stems, and later on heads. As the crop ripens, spores are produced.
Infection of the host can occur in as little as 4 hours in favourable
conditions. Epidemic severity increases exponentially over time and
may appear to "explode" suddenly during favourable weather. The
fungus can only survive in living leaf tissue and overwinters on
volunteer wheat, barley, and certain wild grasses. It is not
soil-borne and spores are spread by wind and mechanical means.
Disease management relies mainly on timely fungicide applications and
choice of crop cultivars.
