Colombia: mass anti-rabies vaccination day in prospect
-----------------------------------------------
Between May and June 2004, 173 persons were bitten by bats in Birrinchao,
along the Purricha river. The government has ordered a vaccination campaign
in the area. The Ministry of Social Protection declared a health emergency
in the Choco region of Colombia, and, announced a day for a mass
vaccination of the population of Birrinchao (along the Purricha river), in
the Bajo Baudo region, after the death of 13 children due to rabies
resulting from bat bites.
Through resolution 002 of Sat 10 Jul 2004, the Ministry ordered
"Declaration of a health emergency in order to control the epidemic of
human rabies originating from the jungle in this department, for a 3 month
period beginning from this date." The document specifies that these
measures are being taken based on the identification of 173 persons, who
were bitten by bats during the months of May and June 2004, of which, 13
children, less than 12 years of age, died.
The zone, according to Minister Diego Palacio, is known as a natural
ecological niche, where there are numerous bats breeding, those which feed
on insects (insectivorous), fruits (frugivorous), or blood (hematophagous).
"Therefore, there exists the possibility of facing an epizootic (that is to
say, when a disease affects a large amount of animals in a geographic
region) of jungle rabies, with the risk that the circulation of the virus
will affect other communities, where there are frequent problems with
vampire bat bites."
In the face of this situation, a committee, comprising the Ministry of
Social Protection, The Pan American Health Organization (PAH), and the
National Institute of Health, amongst others, decided to conduct a mass
vaccination day in the zone. Approximately 2000 persons will be vaccinated.
Colombia will be importing rabies vaccine for the 1st time for this purpose.
