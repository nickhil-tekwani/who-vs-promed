_Salmonella infantis_, increased morbidity
------------------------------------------
Since 1995, a significant, continuous decrease (from 87/100 000 to
37/100 000) of human salmonellosis has been observed in Israel.

The most striking drop is related to _S. typhimurium_ and _S.
enteritidis_. However, according to reports from the Central State
Laboratories in Jerusalem, the National Salmonella Center has
identified a significant relative increase in the size of the _S.
infantis_ segment within the total of _Salmonella_ spp isolates. This
trend started in 2007 and increased in 2008, when _S. infantis_
became the most common _Salmonella_ species in Israel (17 percent of
the total).

A similar increase could be seen in routine examinations of
unprocessed (raw) food, of processed food, and of live poultry tested
prior to slaughter [ante-mortem] [see comment].

Molecular analysis has revealed that a new [_S. infantis_] clone has
been evolving. This clone was absent during pre-2004 years; it seems
to be identified in isolates from all the examined sources and
geographical locations. According to the analysis of sentinel
samples, carried out by Israel's Centre for Disease Control (ICDC),
it appears that a significant increase of _S. infantis_ infections
has been observed since the end of 2007.

Possible/alternating explanations:
1. The spread of new types [serovars] (such as _S. infantis_)
enhanced on the background of intensified control measures on
'veteran' types (_S. enteritidis_, _S. typhimurium_), including
impact of applied poultry vaccinations.
2. Specific, inherent epidemiological characteristics of this type,
leading to increased relative incidence.

ICDC is to undertake an epidemiological investigation to check the
issue and try to identify the reasons for the observed increase.

[According to information from reliable sources, the intensive
veterinary surveillance in poultry breeding flocks throughout Israel
(comprising bi-weekly samplings in each flock), has revealed a
significant increase of _S. infantis_ in recent years. In 2006, 4.95
percent of all _Salmonella_ isolates were _S. infantis_. The figures
for 2007 and 2008 have been 6.27 and 19.9 percent, respectively.

On the other hand, _S. enteritidis_ and _S. typhimurium_, pathogens
of particular public-health importance, have been practically absent
during the said period. In addressing these 2 serovars, the Israeli
Veterinary Services have been meticulously applying stamping-out
policy since the late 90's.

_S. infantis_ is one of the 5 serovars targeted by an EU control
program aiming at their reduction in poultry breeding flocks since
2005. The other serovars are _S. Enteritidis_, _S. Typhimurium_, _S.
Virchow_, and _S. Hadar_.(see 20090125.0337). - Mod.AS]

[_Salmonella enterica_ serotype Infantis is not rare throughout the
world. It may persist in the broiler chicken industry manifesting
antimicrobial resistance (1). Of note, however, in the 1-day-old
chicken model for the measurement of invasiveness, this serotype
appeared to have limited invasiveness as much less than serotypes
Enteritidis (the highest level of invasiveness), Typhimurium and Hadar.
