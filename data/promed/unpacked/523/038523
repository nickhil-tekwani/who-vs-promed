When I visited the farm on Tuesday, the producer had lost 6 adult cows.
They had been burned and were in the process being buried while I was
there. The remaining herd (60 cows with calves) has been vaccinated, and
any animals showing depression are being treated with long acting antibiotics.
He will hold them off the affected pasture for at least 20 days.
The soil around the sites has been burned and buried.

[The question still remains as to why this herd, apparently unaffected in
2000, was affected this year. But without hard facts, speculation is merely
that. - Mod.MHJ
