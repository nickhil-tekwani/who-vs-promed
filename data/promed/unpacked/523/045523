Additional comment on (avian) retroviral neoplasms
--------------------------------------------------
Dr Brad Chadwick's description of facial tumors in Tasmanian devils [see:
Undiagnosed deaths, Tasmanian devils - Australia (02) 20030812.1999] is
interesting, and apparently tragic for this signature Tasmanian species.
I suggest one small potential addition to his notes on site of exposure
induced retroviral neoplasms in avian species. As he described, avian type
C retroviruses induce tumors in immunologically tolerant viremic chickens
that are most often multisystemic lymphosarcomas for subgroups A and B, and
myelocytomas for subgroup J (ALV-J). However, a minor percentage of
chickens exposed horizontally by inhalation as neonates, and which become
tolerant/viremic to ALV-J leukosis viruses, develop subepithelial mucosal
laryngeal and tracheal myelocytomas as their initial tumor. There is then
subsequent multisystemic and leukemic progression. These initial
tracheal/laryngeal tumors have not been definitively proven to be due to
local exposure to virus-laden fomites, and there are alternate
explanations. However, in this subset of ALV-J infected chickens,
horizontal exposure and first tumor do occur at this same site.

Similarity to transmissible venereal tumors in dogs
---------------------------------------------------
The description of a transmissible large round cell tumor is reminiscent of
transmissible venereal tumor (TVT) of dogs (other canids may be infected).
Notable differences to the described disease in Tasmanian devils is that
TVT is clearly transmitted venereally, often regresses spontaneously, and
has a somewhat different cytomorphology (high nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio).
It is the first neoplasm to have been shown to be transmissible, but a
specific etiology has not been demonstrated. Presumably it has been ruled
out in these Australian cases?
