The Equine Disease Communication Center reported a farm in Thurston County, Washington, is under a voluntary quarantine after 3 horses tested positive for equine influenza. The animals from the farm had traveled to a barrel race and came home to expose 4 other horses on the farm.

The Washington state veterinarian is currently working with the private vet.

[Caution should be exercised around this disease. We do not want to be the reason it transfers to other horses. It can be spread by indirect transmission. Likewise, this disease can take a long time for the horse to recover to pre-disease state. Be patient with your animal and support the healing process. It is a serious disease.

Indirect transmission can occur and can be an important means of spread. This includes transmission of the virus on clothing, equipment, brushes, shared water buckets, hands, etc.

Respiratory transmission (most common):
- Inhalation of infective droplets from coughing and snorting horses (may be able to spread as far as 50 yards by this route)
- Respiratory shedding typically lasts for 7-10 days post infection in naive animals; much shorter shedding periods occur in partially immune horses (previously vaccinated horses)

Clinical signs:
- Fever, up to 106 deg F (41.1 deg C), depression, anorexia, muscle pain/weakness
- Dry, harsh cough (sometimes paroxysmal) usually precedes fever. The dry, harsh cough is a frequent clinical sign in EI while it is less common with EHV infection. Cough can last up to 6 weeks after other clinical signs have abated. It can take up to 6 months to regain previous athletic abilities
- Nasal discharge is initially serous, but rarely may become mucopurulent with secondary bacterial infections
- Secondary bacterial infections are very common in influenza-affected horses
- Slightly enlarged retropharyngeal lymph nodes
- May be more severe in donkeys and mules

Rare clinical signs can include distal limb edema and cardiomyopathy. Clinical signs are usually present 3-5 days after exposure (i.e., 3-5-day incubation period). Clinical signs are more common, and more severe, in younger horses (ages 1-5 years old). Older horses usually have milder disease.

Incubation period:
Frequently as short as 24 hours and may be up to 3 days.
