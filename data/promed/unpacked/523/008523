_Meloidogyne arenaria_ (Neal) Chitwood (race 2) is reported for the
1st time in Jordan. The nematode populations were recovered from
several vegetable crops, including tomato (_Lycopersicon esulentum_
Mill), squash (_Cucurbita pepo_ L.), cucumber (_Cucumis sativus_ L.),
and bean (_Phaseolus vulgaris_ L.), at Dier Alla in the northern area
of the Jordan Valley. Symptoms included root galling, leaf chlorosis,
and stunting. Galled plant root samples were collected during a
survey conducted from May 2002 to August 2003 covering most of the
irrigated agricultural areas of Jordan.
83 _Meloidogyne_ spp. populations were collected from various
vegetable crops and fruit trees. Identification to species and race
levels of the nematode populations was based on a combination of
currently available methods, including nematode morphology, host
preference based on the North Carolina (NC) differential host test
(1), and cytogenetics and DNA-fingerprinting. 70 of the 83 collected
populations were identified as _M. javanica_, 5 as _M. incognita_
(race 1), 3 as _M. incognita_ (race 2), and 5 as _M. arenaria_ (race
2).
The perineal patterns of _M. arenaria_ were characterized by a low,
round to indented dorsal arch near the lateral field with irregular
forks in the lateral field, fine smooth striae, and a distinct whorl.
Race 2 was identified with the NC differential host test. Cytogenetic
studies indicated that _M. arenaria_ populations were triploid with
an average of 52.2 chromosomes, while the populations of _M.
incognita_ (race 1), _M. incognita_ (race 2), and _M. javanica_ were
hypotriploid with an average of 45.2, 46.1, and 46.7 chromosomes,
respectively.
2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays were used to confirm
species identification and to study genetic variability of the
_Meloidogyne_ spp. populations, including sequence characterized
amplified regions (SCAR) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD).
In the SCAR-PCR-based assay (2), typical DNA products of 420, 670, or
1200 bp in size were amplified by using extracted DNA of _M.
arenaria_ (race 2), _M. javanica_, or _M. incognita_ (race 1 or 2),
respectively, as template DNA. The RAPD-PCR primer, OPA-01, produced
DNA patterns with bands that clearly distinguished _M. arenaria_ from
the other 2 _Meloidogyne_ spp.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of the root-knot nematode,
_M. arenaria_ race 2, in Jordan.

[Root-knot nematodes, especially _M. incognita_ [Mi], _M. arenaria_ [Ma] and
_M. javanica_ [Mj], cause serious damage to cucumber, melon, watermelon,
pumpkin and squash. The finding of _M. arenaria_ [Ma] in Jordan is certain to
cause considerable yield losses in important food crops. Ma is considered one
of the "major" _Meloidogyne_ species due to its worldwide economic
importance. It is commonly encountered in warmer regions and is seldom found
in areas where average monthly temperatures approach freezing. It is the most
morphologically and cytologically variable of the _Meloidogyne_ species. 2
host races have been differentiated, one that reproduces on peanut (race 1),
and race 2 which does not.
Differences in field resistance to _Meloidogyne_ spp. among 21 melon
cultivars and breeding lines have been reported in Florida, but good
resistance in muskmelon or other cucurbits is not available. A high level of
resistance to the 4 major root-knot nematode species is present in the
African horned cucumber (_Cucumis metuliferus_), but attempts to develop
interspecific hybrids with cucumber cultivars have failed. Resistance to Mj
and Ma races 1 and 2 occur in _Cucumis sativus_ var. line 90430, and
cucumbers resistant to these species or races currently are being developed
at North Carolina State University. Resistance to Mi, Mj and Ma has also been
identified in the West Indian gherkin (_C. anguria_) and other wild _Cucumis_
spp.
Disease management involves use of nematicides for high-value crops
such as peanuts, tobacco, and peach. Where available, resistant
cultivars provide the most economical and environmentally benign
means of control. A PCR-based system has been developed using
species-specific DNA fragments, and it identified all 4 major species
present in South Carolina, but further refinements are required to
maximize its potential. The research has provided a foundation to
develop an accurate root-knot nematode species identification system
(based only on a single 2nd stage juvenile) that can be integrated
into a nematode management system. Rotation experiments are underway
to test the modified PCR-based system when reliability can be
improved. - Mod.DH]
