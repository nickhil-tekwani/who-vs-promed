6 have anthrax
--------------
Six more people from a village in eastern Kazakhstan are in hospital with
suspected cases of anthrax, officials said in Almaty. The 6 are from Koksu,
the same village where a man was initially diagnosed with anthrax, the
Emergencies Agency said. He might have contracted the disease while
slaughtering infected cattle, said the agency. Doctors were also examining
78 others who had contact with the villagers in an effort to prevent any
outbreak of anthrax, the agency said.

[The anthrax season is upon us, and inadequate local veterinary oversight
carries a price. Unfortunately the Scotsman report is parsimonious in not
linking to a relevant prior report and apparently starting at 'Chapter
Two', with "6 more people ..." And the species of the "78 others in contact
with the villagers" is in doubt, as it could refer to the other village
cattle or to villagers buying affected meat. Using my contacts in the
country, I will attempt to find out what really is going on. - Mod.MHJ]
