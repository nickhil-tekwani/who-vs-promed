The 1st case of human infection with Usutu virus was diagnosed in France, in Montpellier, in a man in his 30s. Transmitted by the bite of the _Culex_ mosquito, this virus attacks the nervous system.

There are already dengue, zika and chikungunya virus [In France]. Now here is Usutu virus, just as dangerous, and also transmitted by the bite of a mosquito.

This 1st case of human infection has been detected in France by the Inserm team from Montpellier. The patient, in his 30s, was able to be treated, escaping the serious consequences of this virus, which attacks the nervous system.

"He arrived with a facial paralysis," said Olivier Sillam to our colleagues in the France 3 Region. He could not move the right side of the face. He had a feeling similar to having ants all over his body on the right side, mainly, and small motor [neuron] deficits -- a rather unusual picture.

Carried by the _Culex_ mosquito, the most widespread in France, Usutu virus -- of African origin 1st identified back in 1959 in South Africa --, is a virus of animals. It mainly affects sparrows, blackbirds, blue tits, robins, but also some birds of prey such as the tawney owl and the common owl as well as some migratory birds.

The spread is classic: the mosquito bites a bird carrying the virus, then [bites] a human. For the moment this [human] case is unique in France, while in the rest of Europe, 10 cases were recorded in Italy and 3 in Croatia.

In addition, since 1996, several massive bird mortality events have been attributed to Usutu virus in Italy, Hungary, Switzerland, Spain and Germany.

The only positive point: this virus is not transmitted [directly] from human to human.

[The occurrence of a human case of Usutu virus (USUV) infection in France is not surprising, given its fairly wide-spread distribution in Europe with rare cases in humans and sporadic cases in birds. A 2017 report in Eurosurveillance (see ProMED-mail archive Usutu virus - Europe (04): Austria 20171012.5376689) indicates that Usutu virus emergence in Europe dates back to at least 1996, when an episode of wild bird mortality was observed in the Tuscany region of Italy. USUV-associated bird mortality was subsequently found in several European countries. In 2001, it caused considerable die-off of birds in the Vienna area, mainly Eurasian blackbirds (_Turdus merula_). In 2016, widespread USUV activity was reported in wild birds in Belgium, France, Germany and the Netherlands as well as in Austria (in the same area as 2001-2006) and in Hungary.

This article points out the concern about the presence of Usutu virus in donated blood. It states that transfusions are frequently applied to immunosuppressed or critically ill patients with a potential risk for development of nosocomial USUV-associated neurological disease in these patients, located in USUV endemic countries that do not screen for flaviviruses, including USUV. - Mod.TY
