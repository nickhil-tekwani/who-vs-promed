Rosa Oyarce, the metropolitan health SEREMI [las Secretarias Regionales Ministeriales de Salud; regional governmental ministerial unit], confirmed that the listeriosis outbreak affecting the country in recent months comes from a batch of camembert soft cheese of the Santa Rosa brand, which is already being recalled nationwide.

The batch number is 073 210, with an expiration date of 23 May 2013, and consists of 2000 units that were distributed mostly in Santiago and in the Bio Bio Region, where listeriosis patients were also registered.

According to the SEREMI, once the alert was raised due to the increased number of cases, [health authorities] began an investigation of the products that might be contaminated with the bacterium _Listeria monocytogenes_, including raw food and unpasteurized milk, as well as dairy products such as soft cheeses. Through these tests, the contaminated food was detected.

Oyarce clarified that only "certain items (those with the bacteria) and not the whole production (of cheese) were affected. A single batch was contaminated." The products are already being recalled to prevent further infections.

Jorge Diaz, assistant health secretary, reported that until last week [week of 22 Apr 2013], 34 cases had been registered in the country including 5 deaths. Santiago is the most affected, with 18 cases and 4 deaths.

The SEREMI reiterated the call for people to pay attention to hygiene measures when handling food, especially vulnerable groups, such as pregnant women and the elderly and chronically ill, who are more susceptible to [infection] with the bacteria.

"People who are not at risk will most likely not have many problems apart from general malaise, but for people at higher risk, we maintain the preventive message to avoid eating raw foods or foods such as these (soft cheeses), because the risk is higher for them," she said.

Among the products that as a general rule could be contaminated are unpasteurized milk and its byproducts, raw meat, fish, and seafood, as well as cold cuts and sausages, and fruit and vegetables that have contacted the soil, as the bacterium is typically found in soil and water.

[2] Santiago Metropolitan Region: turkey ham

On Tue 30 Apr 2013, [Rosa Oyarce], the metropolitan health SEREMI [regional governmental ministerial unit], imposed legal measures on a neighborhood store in the commune of San Ramon [Santiago Metropolitan Region], where one of the 18 people affected with listeriosis in the region would have been infected.

The bacteria were found in a [sample of] turkey ham, but according Oyarce, contamination occurred in the cutting machine, since other samples of the same product showed no listeria.

"There is talk of a sick person in the commune of San Ramon who would have consumed foods in some stores in the area. Samples taken from this store tested positive in our environmental health laboratory," said Oyarce. From the 14 shops that were investigated in the commune as a result of the infection of one person, only the store in question gave a positive result, but Oyarce said they would to continue to investigate to find other possible sources of contamination.

The health authority also confirmed that of the 45 samples of different foods from different brands tested during the past week, the Santa Rosa cheeses are the only ones contaminated with listeria.

The authority outlined the following measures to prevent infection with the disease:
- wash hands before and after handling food;
- wash vegetables and fruits;
- wash surfaces and utensils that have been in contact with foods at risk;
- separate raw from cooked foods to avoid cross contamination;
- consume only pasteurized dairy products (milk, fresh cheese, cottage cheese, buttery cheese, chanco cheese, gouda, etc.);
- reheat food at high temperature, to ensure removal of any contamination. Reheating in microwave ovens may be inadequate.

[_Listeria monocytogenes_, the cause of listeriosis, is widely distributed in nature. The organism can be found in soil, water, silage, raw vegetables, raw meat and poultry, raw and pasteurized milk, soft cheeses, kitchen premises, and in the intestinal tract of many animals, including cattle, sheep, and humans, and in crustaceans, fish, shellfish, ticks, and insects.

Most human infections are foodborne, although vertical transmission can occur from mother to fetus transplacentally or during delivery through an infected birth canal, and localized skin infections can occur in veterinarians and farmers by direct contact with infected animals.

Raw milk, soft cheeses such as Latin-American cheeses, feta, brie and camembert, ice cream, raw vegetables and fruit, delicatessen salads such as coleslaw, cold cuts, turkey franks and other hot dogs, pate, deli meats, raw and smoked fish, shellfish such as shrimp, and undercooked chicken have been sources of human listeriosis. Listeria can also survive in frozen food. Even minimal contamination of refrigerated, packaged ready-to-eat products is a problem, since _L. monocytogenes_ grows at refrigerator temperatures, and its presence in food does not alter the taste or smell of the food.

The sources of human infection can be pinpointed by DNA identification techniques that match _Listeria_ spp isolated from a possible source with the strains recovered from patients.

There seems to be 2 concurrent listeriosis outbreaks in Chile at the present time: One involves as of the week of 22 Apr 2013, 34 cases, including 5 deaths nationwide. Santiago Metropolitan Region is the most affected, with 18 cases and 4 deaths. This outbreak apparently has been attributed to a batch (#073 210, with an expiration date of 23 May 2013) of Camembert soft cheese of the Santa Rosa brand, which is already being recalled nationwide. This batch was distributed mostly in Santiago and in the Bio Bio Region. The 2nd outbreak involves at least one of the 18 Santiago cases that has been attributed to turkey ham, which is thought to have been contaminated by the cutting machine at a neighborhood store. The linkages of cases to possible sources are not stated. However, DNA fingerprinting of isolates from the suspected source and from patients could confirm a linkage. Reports of additional cases can be expected even after all the sources have been removed, as the incubation period for listeriosis is up to 2 months.

The Bio Bio Region and Santiago Metropolitan Region (or Metropolitan Region), are 2 of Chile's 15 administrative divisions. The Metropolitan Region, which contains the nation's capital, Santiago, is Chile's smallest by area and most densely populated region (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Metropolitan_Region).
