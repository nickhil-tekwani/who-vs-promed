African swine fever virus (Inf. with), Haiti
--------------------------------------------
General information
Report type: follow-up report no. 1
Event started: 26 Aug 2021
Event confirmed: [Note: the 1st outbreak was confirmed on 17 Sep 2021, the other outbreaks were confirmed on 1 Oct 2021. - Mod.CRD]
Reported: 19 Oct 2021
Reason for notification: recurrence
Last occurrence: 20 Sep 1984
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: African swine fever virus
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

[To date 31 Oct 2021, a total of 7 outbreaks of ASF have been identified in the country, affecting the departments of Sud Est (1), Nord Est (5), and L'Artibonite (1). See details of each outbreak and its location on the interactive map included in the OIE report at the source URL above. - Mod.CRD]

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 7
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Swine / 94 / 32 / 28 / 4 / 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.

Epidemiological comments: out of a total of 44 samples collected and sent to the Plum Island laboratory for the Anse-à-Pitres zone, corresponding to 44 backyard farms, only one sample tested positive for African swine fever (ASF) by said laboratory, and all the others tested negative. In the immediate notification, we confused the quantitative data that were positive for ASF with those for CSF. Therefore, the correct data for ASF are as follows: number of cases: 5 instead of 234 / number of outbreaks: 1 / number of dead animals: 4 instead of 234 / number of animals killed and disposed of: 1 instead of 3 / number of animals slaughtered: 0 instead of 750 / number of susceptible animals: 25 instead of 2500 / epidemiological unit: a single backyard.

Control measures at event level
Domestic control measures applied: quarantine; surveillance outside containment and/or the protection zone; screening.
Domestic control measures to be applied: zoning; surveillance within containment and/or the protection zone; selective killing and disposal; movement control inside the country; disinfection; disinfestation; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; official destruction of animal products.

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Outbreaks / Test / Test date / Result
Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (FADDL), Plum Island Animal Disease Center (OIE reference laboratory) / swine / 1 / Real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) / [14 Sep-1 Oct 2021] / Positive
Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (FADDL), Plum Island Animal Disease Center (OIE reference laboratory) / swine /5 / Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) / [1 Sep-1 Oct 2021] / Positive
Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (FADDL), Plum Island Animal Disease Center (OIE reference laboratory) / swine / 1 / real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) / [30 Aug-17 Sep 2021] / Positive

[In Haiti, and as is mentioned in the epidemiological comments, the quantitative data for the 1st outbreak of ASF reported in September 2021, were confused with those for classical swine fever.

The correct data for the animals affected with ASF, in a backyard herd located in the zone of Anse-à-Pitres, are as follows:
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Swine / 25 / 5 / 4 / 1 / 0
