On [Tue 11 Jun 2019] the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported Canadian animal health officials have reported multiple cases of equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) on a single farm in southern Saskatchewan. So far, 5 horses diagnosed with equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM, the neurologic form of EHV-1) have been euthanized.

"The 1st signs noted were sporadic abortions (6) in a group of 70 late-term brood mares, followed by severe neurological signs in 5 horses, which were subsequently euthanized," the EDCC said. "Equine herpesvirus-1 was confirmed by PCR on 4 Jun 2019."

"The premises has self-quarantined, under supervision of the herd veterinarian; it is anticipated all animals currently on the premises will not be moved for a period of several months," the EDCC continued. "No animals were moved off the premises in the weeks prior to the outbreak. Animal movements onto the farm in the weeks prior to the outbreak are being investigated to try to identify a potential source of introduction of the virus."

In many horses, the 1st or only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected. In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported on [Thu 13 Jun 2019] a horse from Island County, Washington, has tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1).

The EDCC said the Washington State Department of Agriculture indicated the 18-year-old Quarter Horse gelding developed clinical signs -- including a sore back, difficulty standing, and bladder atony (urine retention or dribbling) -- on [Fri 7 Jun 2019]. He tested positive for both EHV-1 wild-type and equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (or EPM) on [Tue 11 Jun 2019], the EDCC said. The horse had been vaccinated and is recovering.

The EDCC said the affected gelding's home farm -- along with 25 other horses residing there -- have been quarantined.

EHV 101
Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and EHM. In many horses, the 1st or only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

Herpesvirus is easily spread by nose-to-nose or close contact with an infectious horse; sharing contaminated equipment including bits, buckets, and towels; or clothing, hands, or equipment of people who have recently had contact with an infectious horse. Routine biosecurity measures, including hygiene and basic cleaning and disinfection practices, should be in place at all times to help present disease spread.

Current EHV-1 vaccines might reduce viral shedding but are not protective against the neurologic form of the disease. Implementing routine biosecurity practices is the best way to minimize viral spread, and the best method of disease control is disease prevention.

[This disease affects so many horses, yet there remains no specific vaccine for the neurological form.

Protect your horse. Vaccinate your horse. If you must travel or visit others, please take your horse's temperature at least twice a day and record it on a chart. A slight rise in temperature may be the earliest sign, so seek help. - Mod.TG
