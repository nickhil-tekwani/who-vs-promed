From: Bill Graney <wmgraney@bellatlantic.net>

In reply to Robin Cooper's note on vancomycin resistance, the acquisition
of the genes
for resistance may not be such a feat. Since significant antibiotic
resistance is almost invariably the result of acquisition of a plasmid
packing all the relevant
genes, the acquisition was a one step event for the progenitor organism.
Since there is a cost for maintaining the plasmid, or any gene, it would
only be retained in an environment where it conveyed an advantage. Plasmid
plus widespread use of the antibiotic is the invariant formula for
resistance. If politically correct ears may hear, it's downright Darwinian.
