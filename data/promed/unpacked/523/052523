TRYPANOSOMIASIS - ZAIRE (4)
===========================

SLEEPING SICKNESS AND COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION
=============================================

Every now and then we get a shot of encouragement,
and I will pass this on to you.

We have set up in the Fumundjoko Health Center a team for
sleeping sickness case finding. Our Vanga team went out last
week with the medicines and equipment to enable the team there to
begin treating stage I patients in the health center there.

In the meantime, the local people have built a large mud "ward"
with a capacity of 12 bamboo beds, a second 18 bed "ward" to
treat tuberculosis patients, and two mud houses for personnel.
Our health zone will assist them in purchasing the lumber for the
doors and windows.

The people organized a major celebration to receive the Vanga
team - much singing and dancing, with traditional elephant-tusk
horns and drums, and a big feast. They obviously are happy with
the help they are receiving and willing to participate in the
development of this service.

The local team is finding more cases, and sick persons are now
coming there from a much wider area. We do have hopes that the
case load will taper off, diminish and perhaps even die away as
the village case-finding and early treatment proceeds.

This does show that, with good communications and help from the
outside, people here will respond and will participate in the
development of such programs. Even though their local
contribution is not great in financial terms, it is a highly
significant contribution because it represents local initiative,
hard work, and the maximum use of local resources.
