Kenya (Baringo). 11 Sep 2019. Laboratory tests at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) have confirmed an outbreak of dengue fever and kala-azar (black fever) diseases in Tiaty sub-county. Kenya Red Cross Society county coordinator Christopher Okotch said results from tests on samples taken a week earlier came out positive on Sunday [8 Sep 2019]. The samples were taken during an outbreak of malaria in Tirioko ward that killed at least 7 children. Dengue fever symptoms are similar to those of malaria. They include fever, vomiting, headache, general body weakness, muscle and joint pains. Like malaria, the disease is spread by infected mosquitoes. Okotch said researchers and medical practitioners were analysing the results. "We are coming up with a programme to conduct more tests and visit remote areas known for the disease to enable us take appropriate action," said Okotch.

The Epidemiological Surveillance Urgency Service (SUVEC) of the Epidemiological Surveillance Network of Catalonia (XVEC) reported this week (computer translated) on a laboratory confirmed autochthonous dengue fever case.

The Monitoring and Control Protocol for mosquito-borne arbovirosis in Catalonia, and the Mosquito Control Service of the Baix Llobregat, the corresponding city councils, the Public Health Agency of Barcelona, and the Diputacion de Barcelona, as agencies involved in this case, are implementing control measures for the vector -- the tiger mosquito -- to prevent its proliferation as well as virus surveillance in mosquitoes by IRTA-CReSA in order to prevent the appearance of new cases.
