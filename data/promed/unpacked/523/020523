A man in Massachusetts has contracted rabies, the 1st time a human has contracted the disease in Massachusetts in 75 years. Public health officials said they believe the Barnstable County man who is over the age of 60 contracted the virus from a bat at his home. He is listed in critical condition at a Boston-area hospital.

The man's family also may have been exposed, and they are receiving treatment. Health officials said the Barnstable County case does not pose a risk to the general public.

Rabies is a viral disease that infects the central nervous system, ultimately causing disease in the brain and death. It can be fatal if treatment is not administered prior to the onset of symptoms. Early-stage symptoms include fatigue, headache and fever. It can progress to acute pain, violent movements, uncontrolled excitement, depression and hydrophobia.

In 1983, a 30-year-old Waltham man died after being exposed to rabies, apparently from a dog bite in Africa. The man developed symptoms about 3 months after returning to the USA and was admitted to Waltham Hospital for treatment. He died on 28 Jan 1983, according to records from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.

TV NewsCenter 5 and TheBostonChannel.com will provide more information when it becomes available.

[This case is the 2nd human case in recent months of rabies virus infection in the United States, presumed to have been contracted (but not directly confirmed) from the bite of a rabid bat. A 46-year-old woman who died on 16 Dec 2011 became South Carolina's 1st case of human rabies in more than 50 years. She had not received post-exposure prophylaxis, and it must be presumed that she was unaware of the bat bite and/or its potential seriousness.

The current case in Massachusetts has similar features. A middle-aged man has developed symptoms of rabies virus infection and has been hospitalised in serious condition. It seems likely that he also was unaware of his injury and/or its seriousness and did not seek post-exposure treatment. His case is the 1st in Massachusetts for 75 years.

The similarity of these cases indicates that the general population of these states is unaware of the seriousness of bat-bites and the need to seek prompt post-exposure treatment before symptoms of rabies virus infection develop. The Health Authorities in these states need to educate their populations to the potential risk of contracting rabies through contact with bats. The prevalence of rabies in the bat populations of these and neighbouring states is something that should be investigated and subjected to surveillance.
