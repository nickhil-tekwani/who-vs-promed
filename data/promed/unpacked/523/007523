[1] Case Update

May 29, 2018. Epidemiological Situation. Democratic Republic of Congo, Ministry of Health
https://us13.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=89e5755d2cca4840b1af93176&id=aedd23c530 [in French, machine trans., edited]

The Epidemiological Situation of Ebola Virus Disease, 28 May 2018:
- A total of 51 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, including 35 confirmed, 13 probable and 3 suspected.
- 2 new suspected cases: 1 in Iboko, 1 in Wangata
- 5 negative tests: 4 in Iboko, 1 in Wangata
- No new positive case
- No new deaths

Epidemiological analyzes have identified contacts living in nearby health areas in Bikoro and Iboko. These contacts are followed and advised to limit their movements during the entire follow-up period of 21 days.

News from the Ebola response

Searching for the latest suspicious cases and contacts in Bongonzo district (Mbandaka)
- After his last trip to Mbandaka, the Minister of Health, Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, instructed the provincial response coordination teams to conduct a search in the Bongonzo district of Mbandaka town in order to identify the latest suspicious cases and contacts. It was in the Bongonzo neighborhood that the patients who had left the Wangata Ebola Treatment Center had taken refuge.
- In the coming days, experts in epidemiological surveillance will move from household to household to ensure that all people who have been in contact with patients are followed and benefit from vaccination. They will be accompanied by teams in charge of communication and psycho-social monitoring to raise awareness among households.

Strengthening activities in Itipo
- During his last visit to Itipo, the Minister of Health was informed that the local population complained that their sick relatives had to be treated in the nearby health area of Bikoro. So far, patients are temporarily taken care of in a transit center in Itipo before being transferred to the Bikoro Reference General Hospital, thus finding themselves far from their families.
- As a result, the Ministry of Health has asked Ministry of Health teams and partners to strengthen all components of the Ebola response in Itipo. A mobile laboratory has already been delivered; community-based surveillance activities will be strengthened, and an Ebola treatment center will soon be installed.

[2] Past Lessons

28 May 2018. Aid workers heed past lessons as they battle Congo Ebola outbreak
[FT, edited] https://www.ft.com/content/2ac3f40c-5ffe-11e8-9334-2218e7146b04 [Byline: John Aglionby]

Rapid roll out of protection kits and traveller screening

Aid workers were just finishing a briefing for local health workers in Mbandaka, the city that is at the centre of an Ebola outbreak, when an emergency call came in. "Someone said: 'Quick there's a suspect patient in this place, you need to go and pick them up'," said Henry Gray, Médecins Sans Frontières coordinator in the Congolese city of one million people. "When they got back, there was another call. There had been a death in the community, and we had to do a safe burial."

It is an example of how aid agencies and Congolese health officials have been working 18 hours a day in Mbandaka to contain an outbreak of the deadly virus since the 1st case was reported in the city 400 km northeast of the capital Kinshasa 11 days ago. The aim is to prevent a repeat of the devastating 2014-16 outbreak in west Africa that killed 11 600, when a slow and poorly coordinated response was blamed for prolonging the crisis.

There have been 56 reported infections and 25 deaths since the 1st case in the latest outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo was confirmed in the remote Bikoro region on 8 May 2018, according to the health ministry. "It's somewhere between on a knife-edge and under control," said Michael Ryan, an assistant director-general of the World Health Organisation who is coordinating the UN response to the crisis. "Things are improving, but I don't believe we've yet detected every possible case, so we are remaining at very high alert.

"We're dealing with extremes here, a densely populated city at one end, to a deep forest situation at the other." Health workers in Mbandaka say myriad lessons have been learned from the West Africa epidemic, where Mr Gray said the response was "clearly not adequate".

"The response has been a lot stronger with a lot more resources brought to bear," said the veteran of 9 such crises. "It hasn't made the difference yet, but when we look back in hindsight, it will be noted that this early stage and massive mobilisation of resources ... will have helped."

International experts said a big difference had been that the host government had made no attempt to downplay the risks of the virus spreading. They added that Kinshasa had shown strong leadership despite the government being embroiled in a long-running political crisis over the refusal of President Joseph Kabila to step down at the end of his elected term.

Protection kits were sent to hospitals in Mbandaka, and traveller screening was started before the confirmation of the 1st cases in the city of the highly contagious virus that is spread by fruit bats.

"The government knew this outbreak presented a higher risk than last year's [2018] [smaller] outbreak due to the fact the health workers were among the 1st victims," said Oly Ilunga, the health minister. "All the major international organisations have worked in better alignment with the government's Ebola response plan."

[3] Treatment and logistic centers
- MSF Ebola Treatment Center
- WHO logistical base

29 May 2018. With a capacity of 40 beds, the Ebola Treatment Center is ready - photo report
[Actualite.cd] https://actualite.cd/2018/05/29/rdc-mbandaka-avec-une-capacite-de-40-lits-le-centre-de-traitement-debola-est-pret-reportage-photos/

Located 15 km from Mbandaka, the Ebola Treatment Center has been ready since Sunday [27 May 2018] to welcome all cases that were initially intended for the Wangata Reference General Hospital.

This center is built and managed by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). With a capacity of 40 beds, this center has anticipated the possibility of an explosion of the epidemic.

"We are planning different phases. The 1st phase provides for about 40 beds in total. It's more ambitious than the number of patients we have today, but we want to be well prepared. We will have about 20 beds for suspected cases and the same number of beds for confirmed cases," Henri Gray, head of MSF's intervention in Mbandaka, told Actualite.cd.

The site belongs to the Catholic Church, which donated it for medical care. It can accommodate up to 50 people and MSF staff. The work had attracted locals who, for the most part, were happy with the facility.

27 May 2018. Mbandaka: David Gressly hails "quick mobilization" against Ebola fever
[Radio Okapi, edited] https://www.radiookapi.net/2018/05/27/actualite/sante/mbandaka-david-gressly-salue-la-mobilisation-rapide-contre-la-fievre

The response to the outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever in Mbandaka and Bikoro "is encouraging," the UN Deputy Special Representative in the DRC in charge of operations, David Gressly, said on Saturday [26 May 2018]. For 2 days, he visited the coordination activities in Mbandaka and the field response in Iboko, about 180 km southeast of Mbandaka.

MONUSCO must not deviate from its logistical support mission for the well-being and security of the Congolese, according to David Gressly. This is why, as a result of this epidemic of Ebola haemorrhagic fever in Mbandaka and Bikoro, the UN mission immediately undertook several actions, at the request of the Congolese authorities.

The 1st is the rehabilitation of the emergency operation center, which is the headquarters of the provincial coordination in Mbandaka. In this center, MONUSCO proceeds with the repair and equipment of the building, with the establishment of electricity and the Internet connection, in order to facilitate the digitization of the response.

During his 48-hour stay in Equateur, David Gressly also visited the site that houses the logistics base for managing the Ebola crisis. It is being renovated by MONUSCO at Mbandaka airport.

This base will be used by all partners in support of the response. Added to this is a camp of medical personnel that MONUSCO built in Iboko, where several new suspected cases have just been reported. The goal is to counter the spread of the epidemic beyond this border community to the province of Mai-Ndombe.

But, David Gressly rather completed his mission on Saturday [26 May 2018] with a note of satisfaction of the work carried out and the collaboration between partners engaged in the response: "The mobilization for the response to this epidemic is impressive. So, I'm very happy to see that under the leadership of the government and WHO, I believe that with this rapid mobilization we can finally contain this epidemic."

[4] Financing mechanisms
- UK funding
- Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility

29 May 18. UK funds to help Congo tackle Ebola outbreak
[Public Finance International, edited] http://www.publicfinanceinternational.org/news/2018/05/uk-funds-help-congo-tackle-ebola-outbreak [Byline: Simone Rensch]

The UK has pledged an extra 5 million pounds [USD 6.6 million] to tackle the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

International development secretary Penny Mordaunt said last week the fresh support would help the central African country strengthen its health systems to treat and manage the growing number of Ebola cases.

This will be done through the World Health Organization over the next 3 months.

"The UK has acted swiftly to scale up the response to this outbreak of Ebola, a horrific disease which we know has the potential to cause devastating loss of life," Mordaunt said.

"Our support is vital in helping to contain Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo and stop it spreading to other countries and ultimately the UK."

She added that the WHO would monitor the spread of the disease, identify and diagnose cases and trace people at risk of infection, as well as offer vaccinations and treatment.

The DRC government declared the Ebola outbreak on 8 May 2018 after 2 cases were confirmed.

The new UK funding comes on top of one million pounds [USD 1.3 million] that DfID made available through its joint research initiative on epidemic preparedness with Wellcome, a global foundation which support scientists and researchers.

Wellcome has made a further 2 million pounds [USD 2.6 million] available. The UK Department for Health and Social Care also provided 4 million pounds [USD 5.3 million] to the WHO's Contingency Fund for Emergencies in March 2018.

28 May 2018. Congo Ebola outbreak offers 1st test for emergency fund to prevent pandemics
[Irin News, edited] http://www.irinnews.org/2018/05/28/congo-ebola-outbreak-offers-first-test-emergency-fund-prevent-pandemics. [Byline: Ben Parker]

A new financial mechanism that frees up emergency funding to ward off a pandemic has been activated for the 1st time, in response to an outbreak of Ebola virus in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Efforts to halt the outbreak received an injection of USD 12 million from the new World Bank fund and, if Ebola spreads to other countries and infects more people, hundreds of millions more could be released from a sister insurance scheme.

The Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility, or PEF, was set up after the 2013-2016 West Africa Ebola epidemic, which was only brought under control at a cost of more than 11 000 lives and about USD 3 billion, and after late and insufficient response efforts failed to stem the disease.

The World Bank says the PEF's combination of donor cash and capital from the insurance markets provides a new model for epidemic response. ...

The day after the 22 May 2018 release of a 3-month response plan devised by Kinshasa with international aid groups, the new emergency financing facility agreed to disburse USD 12 million. This contributed towards an overall fundraising target for the plan of USD 56 million.

"I'm very excited," Mukesh Chawla, coordinator of the PEF, said in an interview with IRIN, adding that the facility aimed to work "as fast as possible, as early as necessary."

A spokesperson for the Congolese Ministry of Health said the PEF cash injection had closed a significant funding gap and allowed the government to concentrate on responding. In an email referring to the response plan, Jessica Ilunga said the government had received fresh commitments from other donors of about USD 25 million, as well as an agreement to redirect more funding towards Ebola from another USD 15 million World Bank project.

How does PEF work?

The facility has 2 elements (or "windows"): cash and insurance.

The cash window, from where the DRC Ebola funds come, operates much like other pooled donor funds such as the UN's Central Emergency Response Fund. Grants can be released to any of 77 low-income countries based on the decision of a steering group of the donors, advised by the WHO and other experts. The World Bank manages the funds and disbursements. Any affected country can apply for funds and, if the outbreak meets the PEF's criteria and a response plan is given a green light by the WHO, the steering group can then release the cash.

In the case of Congo, the PEF has committed to USD 12 million, some of which will be spent by the government and some by relief agencies, according to its operational rules. ...

Dercon says the other part of the PEF, the insurance window, is more "imaginative." It's effectively a giant insurance policy, covering the 77 poorest member countries of the World Bank. Payouts are triggered if certain types of disease outbreaks spread to multiple countries and pass preset thresholds of death toll and speed.

If, in the case of Ebola for example, there were 250 deaths across 2 countries (more than 20 times the current confirmed death toll), significant payouts would flow. Private investors earn interest on bonds that back the policy, but can lose all or part of their capital in the event of major outbreaks. ...

[5] Flight patterns from DRC

25 May 2018. Here's where Ebola could spread based on flight patterns
[CNBC, edited] https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/25/ebola-outbreak-could-spread-through-these-flight-patterns-group-says.html
[Byline: Angelica LaVito

EcoHealth Alliance identified places where the virus could travel based on flight patterns.

An Ebola outbreak is emerging in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and a nonprofit that studies infectious diseases identified where it could spread based on flight patterns.

So far, 58 cases believed to be Ebola, including 27 deaths, have been reported from 3 spots in the DRC's Equateur Province. World Health Organization officials this week started administering Merck's experimental Ebola vaccine to health workers in affected areas.

EcoHealth Alliance, a nonprofit that studies outbreaks, used software to identify where Ebola could spread through infected passengers. The system used flight patterns from the airports in Mbandaka, Kinshasa and Brazzaville, those nearest to Bikoro, where the outbreak started.

This doesn't mean Ebola will make it to these cities, said EcoHealth Alliance President Peter Daszak. Rather, the findings should encourage officials in these places to prepare so they're not scrambling if it does.

"The problem with diseases like Ebola, the minute a case is reported, the public overreacts, which is natural because Ebola is a scary disease," Daszak said. "The breakdown of logistics is too late to get properly organized. Health authorities need to get outbreak teams assembled and ready. Communication needs to be set up to get ready."

Ebola spreads through direct contact with bodily fluids. Authorities are scrambling to contain this outbreak and prevent it from growing into one like the 2014 West African outbreak, which was the deadliest occurrence of the disease since it was discovered in 1976.

Authorities in DRC know what they're doing, Daszak said. This is the 9th outbreak of Ebola over the last 4 decades in the country, with the most recent one being last May [2017], according to WHO.

EcoHealth Alliance found these cities are the most closely connected to the point of origin of the ongoing outbreak:

1. Pointe-Noire, Republic of Congo
2. Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
3. Brazzaville, Republic of Congo
4. Lubumbashi, Democratic Republic of Congo
5. Brussels, Belgium
6. Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo
7. Paris, France
8. Nairobi, Kenya
9. Johannesburg, South Africa
10. Kisangani, Democratic Republic of Congo

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall

[In addition to the latest case update from the DRC Ministry of Health, today's [29 May 2018] ProMED postings have one overarching theme: preparedness.

As described in part [2], the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa taught the world a terrible lesson: slow and poorly coordinated responses from both government and international agencies can allow an outbreak to mushroom into a multi-national epidemic. Right now, the epidemiologic response to the current outbreak in the DRC is "on the knife-edge," and numerous resources are being brought in as soon as possible to not only handle current cases, but also prepare for an expanding outbreak.

Among these of course is the need to create Ebola isolation and treatment units, and the photo assay in part [3] illustrates a typical "pop-up" ETU built under MSF auspices in an isolated ex-urban area. Local command-and-control centers, such as the one that WHO has now established in Mbandaka, are necessary to coordinate all epidemiological activities on a day-today basis, including ETC's (Ebola Treatment Centres), contract tracers, safe burial teams, disinfection units, and (not least) respected community leaders.

Often overlooked are the rapid and sometimes unconventional financing mechanisms needed to fund all these activities [part 4]. Epidemic responses cross not only international borders, but also bureaucratic silos, so such funding is often channeled through both governmental and non-governmental institutions, as exemplified by the present UK funding commitments. In the wake of the West African epidemic, the World Bank created the Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility (PEF) for funding at a larger multinational scale. The PEF includes a novel insurance scheme with bond interest payments to attract an entirely new source of potential funding: private sector capital.

Finally, preparedness also includes data-driven scenarios of how an outbreak may spread. To give just one example: short- and long-range airlines continue to proliferate in our globalized world economy. Eco Health Alliance has helpfully analyzed flight patterns out of the current Ebola outbreak epicenter in the DRC [part 5]. The appearance of major international air hubs like Paris and Brussels on this Top Ten list is a sobering reminder of the potential for an epidemic to become pandemic, and evokes memory of the unfortunate young Liberian man who in 2014 flew from Monrovia to Brussels to Dulles airport to Dallas - all within a space of 28 hours - only to become symptomatic with fatal Ebola disease after arriving in the United States. - Mod.
