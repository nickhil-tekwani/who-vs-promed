Subject: 13th International Dengue Course, 2nd announcement
Under the auspices of:
'Pedro Kouri' Tropical Medicine Institute (IPK)
Cuban Society of Microbiology & Parasitology
Ministry of Public Health of the Republic of Cuba (MINSAP)
Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)/ World Health Organization (WHO)

An increase in dengue transmission has been observed in the last 40 years with its expansion to other geographical areas and an increase in the report of epidemics and dengue cases including severe and fatal cases. Recently the World Heath Organization, WHO, introduced a new dengue clinical classification (dengue and severe dengue) that is under implementation in endemic countries. Besides, the WHO Global strategy for dengue prevention and control for the period 2012-2020 was published with the aim to diminish the mortality by 50 percent and morbidity by 25 percent in this period.

In this context, the PAHO/WHO Collaborating Center for the Study of Dengue and its Vector of the "Pedro Kouri" Tropical Medicine Institute (IPK), Havana, Cuba, together with the Cuban Ministry of Public Health, the Cuban Society of Microbiology & Parasitology, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) among others will organize the 13th edition of the dengue international course at the "Pedro Kouri" Tropical Medicine Institute of Havana, from 12-23 Aug 2013.

Objective of the course
-----------------------
The objective of the course is that participants -- physicians, virologists, immunologists, sociologists, epidemiologists, entomologists, and health managers, among others interested in this field, along with many professors from several prestigious national and international institutions -- may have the opportunity to debate on the most relevant and updated aspects of this disease and its control.

Topics of the course
--------------------
Through theoretical and practical sessions, the main aspects related to dengue will be covered: dengue epidemiology, clinical management, diagnosis, virology and immunology, vector control, environmental risk factors and community participation. Important aspects to be discussed are trends of dengue at global level, impact of climate change, new dengue clinical classification, opportunities for diagnosis, impact of virus diversity, immunogenetics, complexity of dengue immunity and pathogenesis, dengue vaccines, integrated surveillance and control, difficulties, options, challenges, economic burden, new options for control, insecticide resistance, the environment, health systems and dengue, among others. Within the framework of the course, the new global initiatives for dengue and the experiences of several countries and geographical regions will be updated.

In the 1st week, general lectures as well as round tables and symposia on the topics of clinic, emergency response, diagnostic, pathogenesis, vaccines, antiviral drugs, integrated control, and emergent arboviruses are also scheduled. 2 mini-courses on GIS [geographic information system] and dengue and modeling of transmission and prediction of dengue, as well as other activities and meetings will be also organized.

General topics to be covered:
- Global epidemiological situation.
- International initiatives
- Integrated dengue surveillance
- Viral genome and structure
- Viral replication
- Clinical picture and pathology; clinical management
- WHO dengue clinical classification
- PAHO/WHO Dengue Guidelines for clinical management
- Dengue diagnostic and laboratory surveillance
- Humoral and cellular immune response. Innate immunity
- Antibody dependent enhancement (ADE).
- Genetic host factors
- Pathogenesis and physiopathology
- Animal models
- Vaccine candidates and antivirals
- Vector ecology
- Vector dynamic for dengue transmission
- Entomological surveillance.
- Chemical and biological vector control methods
- Mechanisms of Insecticide Resistance
- Social aspects in dengue
- Mathematical models for dengue transmission study
- Integral strategy for dengue prevention and control
- Ecobiosystem approach for dengue control and prevention
- The community role in dengue control
- Cost/effectivity of dengue control activities
- Emergency management for outbreak control
- Cuban experience: surveillance and control
- Climate change and dengue
- Emergent arboviruses

Organization of the course
--------------------------
The Course is structured in 2 sections: theoretical and practical. The theoretical section will be conducted during the 1st week and the practical section during the 2nd week.

In the theoretical section, general lectures, round tables, and symposia have been scheduled.
In the practical section, participants will gather in several groups, according to their interests: clinical care, entomology, community participation, virology/immunology and epidemiology.
Participants will have opportunity to present their results in a poster session scheduled in the 1st week. Poster characteristics: 94 cm wide X 140 cm high (vertical position). Deadline for abstract submission: 1 Jul 2013.

Official languages
------------------
The official languages of the Course are: Spanish and English.

Registration
