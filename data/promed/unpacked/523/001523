The FMD virus isolated from beef cattle in Majdal Shams, on the Syrian border, has been identified by the National laboratory, Kimron Veterinary Institute, as serotype O.

[Genotyping of the isolate will enable further assessment of the event, addressing issues such as the source/route of infection and the compliance of the vaccines applied.

It will also be of value to check the relationship between the current isolate to other FMDV serotype O virus strains circulating in the Eastern Mediterranean/Middle East.

According to the data available in the website of the World Reference Laboratory for FMD (WRLFMD), Pirbright, FMDV serotype O has been identified during 2013 in samples from the following 5 countries in the said region:
1. Iran: 4 samples received during January 2013, serotyped O and genotyped; for details, see http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/me/irn.htm.
2. United Arab Emirates: 2 samples received during March 2013, serotyped O and genotyped; for details, see http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/me/uae.htm.
3. Turkey: 13 samples received during April 2013, serotyped O and genotyped; for details, see http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/me/tur.htm.
4. Libya: 7 samples received on 29 Oct 2013, serotyped O and genotyped; for details, see http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/africa/lib.htm and ProMED-mail posting 20131121.2066197.
5. Saudi Arabia: 3 samples received on 7 Nov 2013, serotyped O, genotyping results not yet publicly available; see http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/me/sau.htm.

The Libyan strain has notably been found closely related to FMDV serotype O strains circulating during 2013 in India. It would be interesting to check the relationship of other regional strains, including the new isolate from the Golan Heights (which is, most probably, circulating also across the border, namely in Syria and probably also in Lebanon), to the Libyan and/or the Indian strains. - Mod.AS
