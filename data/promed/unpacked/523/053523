Measles is particularly dangerous in young infants, but anyone can
get the disease at any time. In the 1990s, experts thought they were
close to eliminating measles for good. But now the World Health
Organization (WHO) has put back its target date for getting rid of the
disease to 2015. But even that seems unlikely.

The reason is a measles outbreak which is spreading across Europe,
affecting France, Belgium, Germany and Romania, and now the UK. Other
significant outbreaks are taking place in Serbia, Spain, Macedonia and
Turkey, the WHO says.

Over the last few months, the [UK] Health Protection Agency (HPA) has
seen an increase in measles cases in children and young adults in
England and Wales. Their figures show that between January and April
2011, 275 laboratory-confirmed cases of measles were reported,
compared to 33 cases for the same period of the previous year. The HPA
says these cases are "associated with either recent travel abroad or
small clusters in mainly unvaccinated children and young adults
between the ages of 10-24."

Health protection units across England and Wales are warning parents
to make sure their children have received 2 doses of the MMR vaccine
before travelling to mainland Europe in the next few months. They are
particularly concerned that as families plan summer holidays on the
continent, and schools organise trips and exchanges abroad,
unvaccinated children and young adults will be at risk. Measles in
pregnancy can cause miscarriage, premature labour or a baby with low
birth weight.

The most effective way of preventing measles is the measles, mumps
and rubella (MMR) vaccine. There is no link between the MMR vaccine
and autism. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at the HPA, said:
"Measles is a highly infectious and dangerous illness which spreads
very easily particularly in schools and universities. It is crucial
that children and young adults are fully immunised with 2 doses of
MMR." Letters have been sent to some primary schools and further
education colleges in London, where confirmed measles cases have
reached 86 so far this year [2011].

Dr David Elliman, consultant community paediatrician at Great Ormond
Street Hospital in London, has noticed a rise in cases and says it is
never too late to be vaccinated. "Anybody can get measles at any time,
but it's particularly dangerous in very young children and young
adults. Any opportunity people have to visit their GP and ask for the
vaccine should be taken. In France, their perception of the measles
risk has changed."

Dr Rebecca Martin, WHO-Europe, has said that one in 15 people have
complications with measles, and one in 1000 will die of it, but that
the 2 doses of MMR will protect people against the disease.

"Figures show 84 percent of children [in the UK] had received their
2nd dose of the MMR vaccine by the age of 5, but we need 95 percent
uptake to stop it going around, and we are still not there," Dr
Elliman says. The situation in France, however, is considerably worse.
A measles epidemic has officially been declared there, with nearly
5000 cases reported between January and March this year [2011]. That
is almost equal to the total number of cases reported in France (5090)
during the whole of 2010. The WHO says France is taking immediate
steps to control the outbreaks by vaccinating infants at 9 months of
age and offering the vaccine to all unimmunised or under-immunised
people over that age.

Dr Rebecca Martin, the WHO's programme manager for vaccination and
preventable diseases in Europe, believes the reason that numbers of
measles cases in France are so high is down to complacency. "In
France, they didn't see the disease any more, so people thought there
was no need to get their children immunised, rather than put them
through 2 injections and, possibly, a fever afterwards. Their
perception of the risk changed."

The organisation which oversees public health in France, Institut de
Veille Sanitaire (INVS), is worried. In a newspaper article, Francoise
Weber, the director of INVS, estimated that the cases already
confirmed by health professionals in France are only "the tip of the
iceberg." But measles can be eliminated in Europe, the WHO's Dr Martin
says. "In the Americas, measles was eliminated in 2002. There are no
indigenous cases there now because everyone has been immunised, so it
can be done. But it's a slow process, and we need to accelerate our
efforts."

The Health Protection Agency (HPA) last night warned people to ensure
their children were immunised after several people were struck down
with the viral disease in Wirral.

There have been 2 confirmed cases, both children, and an undisclosed
number of suspected cases in both children and adults. One of these
patients is in hospital. None of those affected was fully immunised.

Dr Sam Ghebrehewet, Director of the HPA's Cheshire and Merseyside
Health Protection Unit, said: "These cases in Wirral show just how
important it is for parents to ensure that their children are given 2
doses of MMR [measles mumps and rubella] vaccine. We are also
reminding teenagers and young adults who haven't previously been
vaccinated that it is not too late for them. They should seek advice
from their family doctors. MMR [vaccine] is a safe and effective. Two
doses give full immunity against measles, mumps and rubella, diseases
that can have serious side effects. On very rare occasions people die
from measles."

The HPA also warned about a outbreak of measles across Europe,
particularly in France. The agency has strongly advised parents who
may be taking children on a continental holiday this summer [2011] to
ensure that they are fully protected by 2 doses of MMR vaccine. Doses
of MMR vaccine are normally given at 13 months and between the ages of
3 and 4 years, just before the child goes to school. However, children
of any age, including teenagers and young adults, can still be
vaccinated if they missed out on immunisation when they were younger.

Two doses of MMR vaccine are needed for complete protection. Measles
is an infectious viral illness that is spread when infected people
cough or sneeze. The most common symptoms are fever, coughs, sore eyes
and a rash that develops 3 to 4 days after the onset of illness,
starting with the face and head and spreading down the body. Parents
should not take children with suspected measles symptoms to their GP
surgery or local hospital's A&E unit, where they might risk passing on
the infection to other vulnerable children. Information on measles is
also available at http://www.immunisation.nhs.uk.

Parents planning to take children to France on holiday should get
them vaccinated against measles because France is in the grip of an
epidemic, the Health Protection Agency says.

France has had 7000 cases of measles so far this year [2011],
according to the HPA. In the UK, there have been 275 laboratory
confirmed cases since the start of the year, compared with 33 in the
same period last year.

Measles is a disease usually mild but distressing in children,
sometimes with serious consequences requiring hospitalization. There
has been a sharp upsurge in France and in the region in recent months.
This has been a consequence of insufficient vaccine coverage in the
local population, according to the Regional Health Agency (LRA).

A young mother with measles-affected children, interviewed by Midi
Libre, said she had not deemed it necessary to have her children
vaccinated in the conviction that vaccination weakens the immune
system. "But, I can tell you that I have completely changed my mind. I
regret not having them vaccinated," she said.

The youngest of her daughters is enrolled in a school with several
hundred pupils where many of the parents are opposed to vaccination
and which has been badly affected by the outbreak. Indeed, more than
half the pupils at this school have been affected. In the opinion of a
local GP in Nimes, this is no surprise, since in 90 percent of cases,
the children suffering from measles had not been vaccinated. The
remaining 10 percent of affected children are those who have not
received the 2nd dose of vaccine. The MMR (measles, mumps, rubella)
vaccine recommended by health authorities should be delivered in 2
doses, the 1st at one year of age and the 2nd between 3 and 6 years of
age.

The GP said that in recent weeks he has seen a dozen cases in his
office, "something I have not seen in the past 20 years. It's the same
with my colleagues, and it is continuing," he added. "This confirms
the magnitude of the current epidemic. The Regional Health Agency has
stated that for a population to be protected, there must be 95 percent
immunization coverage. But in the [Languedoc-Roussilon] region at
present, only 80 to 85 percent (and in some areas only 50 percent) of
the population have been vaccinated."

The Indian Ocean Health Agency (L'Agence de Sante Ocean Indien) has
reported that this week, an autochthonous case of measles has been
confirmed. The case is a 26-year-old unvaccinated woman. At present,
her condition is not a cause for concern.

The island Health Service [L'Agence de Sante Ocean Indien] has stated
that vaccination is the only protection against measles virus
infection. Two injections are essential to provide compete immunity.
The vaccine recommended is the triple MMR vaccine, providing
protection against mumps, measles and rubella.

L'Agence de Sante Ocean Indien strongly recommends that both the
general population and particularly those likely to travel abroad
should verify their vaccination status to ensure that they have
received both doses of the MMR vaccine. The measles outbreak in
metropolitan France and elsewhere continues unabated and affects
adults and young people as well as children and babies. Measles
infection is often erroneously considered to be benign, whereas
serious consequences can ensue. Those who have previously contracted
measles and have recovered remain protected. For the rest of the
population, vaccination remains the best option.

Vaccination can be carried out by general practitioners and at
pediatric clinics without charge. Since October 2010, health assurance
polices will cover the cost of 2 doses of MMR vaccine for children up
to the age of 17, and 65 percent of the cost for others.

Illnesses caused by measles [virus] infection have killed at least 3
children in the Amtali area of Lama upazila [district] last week.
Doctors on Saturday [14 May 2011] said over 100 Murang children of the
upazila had been suffering due to the infection.

Bandarban civil surgeon Sakhawat Hossain told bdnews24.com that one
child died in the hospital on Friday [13 May 2011], while 2 others
died at their own residences on Tuesday [10 May 2011]. He said they
died due to diarrhoea and pneumonia, caused by measles infection.

Hossain said 17 children were still undergoing treatment at the
health complex. Many are being treated locally by a medical team. One
medical team has been deployed in each upazila.

Acting health and family planning officer of Lama Shafiur Rahman said
measles was spreading in the area due to hot and humid weather and
lack of safe drinking water.

As the summer vacation season nears, measles cases are on the rise in
California, driven by unimmunized travelers infected elsewhere who are
entering the state, health officials said Friday [13 May 2011]. "We
see that as worrisome," Dr. Gilberto Chavez, deputy director of the
California Department of Public Health, said in an interview. Those
infected with measles include not only unimmunized Californians
traveling abroad but also foreign visitors to the state and others who
simply came in contact with infected travelers, Chavez said.

Measles had been considered eliminated in the western hemisphere,
with very few cases of illness, but it is a significant problem in
Europe, Asia and Africa. A measles outbreak in Europe has spread
through 30 countries, with 6500 people infected so far this year
[2011]. France has been hit the worst. In one hot spot in Belgium, the
virus is hitting hardest unimmunized children, those whose parents
don't believe in vaccinations, and infants who have not yet been
inoculated, according to the World Health Organization. Measles is
also spreading through India and the Philippines.

Although infants are traditionally given inoculations after they
reach one year of age, Chavez said infants who are traveling abroad
can receive the measles vaccine as early as 6 months of age.

So far this year [2011], there have been 13 measles cases in
California, with 7 reported in April 2011 alone. Four patients have
been hospitalized. Health officials are concerned because measles can
spread very quickly, especially if it takes root in a population of
unvaccinated people.

In 2008, a 7-year-old boy triggered a measles outbreak in San Diego
after he returned, infected, from a family trip to Switzerland. The
boy infected his 2 siblings and 9 other children at his public charter
school and a doctor's office. His parents had chosen not to vaccinate
him or his siblings. The outbreak forced about 70 children to be
quarantined at home.

Measles is on the rise in California, with one case reported in
Orange County, state health officials said Friday [13 May 2011]. The
extremely contagious virus is spreading through travel to developing
nations or Europe, where some parents choose not to vaccinate.

Among California's 13 cases, 7 have been reported since April 2011,
the Department of Public Health announced. In Orange County, an
unidentified child contracted measles while traveling overseas, said
Health Care Agency spokeswoman Tricia Landquist. "California, like the
rest of the nation and, indeed, the world, is experiencing an increase
in measles cases that is entirely preventable with immunization," said
Dr. Gilberto Chavez, Deputy Director for Infectious Diseases, in a
statement. "Anyone who will be traveling or is expecting contact with
recent international travelers should confirm that their vaccinations
are up-to-date."

Measles outbreaks are underway in India, the Philippines and Europe,
including deaths in France. In Europe, the illnesses are blamed on
reduced vaccination rates because of the fear of children developing
autism. Last year [2010], a prominent British medical journal
retracted a study that had connected the measles, mumps and rubella
vaccine to autism. Among every 1000 children who become ill with
measles, one or 2 will die from the disease, according to the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The CDC recommends the following: 2 doses of vaccine for children,
the 1st at 12 to 15 months and the 2nd dose before entering school at
4 to 6. Before international travel, infants 6 to 11 months old should
have at least one dose. Children 12 months of age or older should have
2 doses separated by at least 28 days. Adults should review their
vaccination records to determine if they need to be vaccinated.

The [Orange] county's Health Care Agency provides free MMR
immunizations for eligible children.

An Orange County preschooler has been diagnosed with measles, the 1st
case of a local resident getting the disease in 17 years, health
officials say. The preschooler attended a function at a private school
and also visited a doctor's office and a hospital recently. Orange
County Health Department staffers notified officials at all 3
locations, instructing those who have not been vaccinated against
measles to stay home until 20 May 2011 when the incubation period
ends.

The child is recovering and is at home, said Dain Weister, Orange
County Health Department spokesman. "We've not had a problem for many
years," said Dain Weister. "There have been some outbreaks across the
country; specifically Europe is having a problem right now and
problems from travel, but we haven't had a local case."

The medical community also has been notified to be on the watch for
rash-like illnesses. Residents who received routine measles
vaccination as children will have immunity and in most cases will be
protected.

The new case is not related to the 3 measles cases in tourists that
were reported in early April [2011]. In those cases, 3 tourists from
Texas, Michigan and Minnesota who traveled to Orlando were diagnosed
with measles. Health authorities were unsure whether the travelers
caught the disease from an Orlando resident or whether one tourist
spread it to another. The latest case is not related, Weister said,
because so much time has elapsed between those incidences and this
one.

Health officials remind parents that the best way to protect their
children is to make sure they are immunized against measles by the
combination MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine. Children should
receive 2 doses, the 1st at 12 to 15 months of age, and the 2nd at 4
to 6 years of age.

Symptoms of measles generally begin about one to 2 weeks after a
person is infected, and include a blotchy rash, fever, cough, runny
nose and conjunctivitis as well as achy, run-down feelings and tiny
white spots with bluish-white centers inside the mouth. Measles is
spread through the air by infectious droplets and is highly
contagious. It can be transmitted from 4 days before the rash becomes
visible to 4 days after the rash appears. For information about
measles and vaccination information, go to

The Ministry of Health says it has so far recorded 1076 cases [of
measles], with the majority of the cases in Lundazi, Chipata, and
Chadiza districts of Eastern Province. Dr. Mbewe noted that the
provincial health office is coordinating awareness campaigns on the
importance of ensuring that children are immunized. Dr. Mbewe said
both static and outreach immunization services have been intensified
in all districts. He explained that active surveillance for cases is
ongoing to minimize cases in the community from spreading and to
identify cases.

A health spokesperson said in Lusaka today [10 May 2011] during a
press briefing that the ministry will also be conducting mass
immunization in affected areas and further advised parents in the
country to take their children for immunization against measles. "As
you know, last year [2010], the Ministry of Health conducted a
