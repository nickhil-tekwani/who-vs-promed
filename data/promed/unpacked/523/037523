Health officials confirmed Wednesday [21 Aug 2013] that bats in Saudi Arabia were the source of the mysterious virus that has sickened 96 people in the Middle East, killing 47 of them.

The outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, has been going on for 15 months, with most victims falling ill in Saudi Arabia and others growing sick after having traveled to the Middle East. In a study released Wednesday [21 Aug 2013], an international team of doctors blamed coronavirus in bats for the human outbreak, but said that many questions remained, in part because a perfect match for the virus was found in only a single insect-eating bat out of about 100 Saudi bats tested. And since such bats do not normally bite people, drool on fruit or do other things that might transmit the disease to people, it was still unclear how the virus leapt to humans.

The bat is a _Taphozous perforatus_, or Egyptian tomb bat, which roosts in abandoned buildings, and the virus was found in a fecal sample.

So it is possible, said Dr Jonathan H Epstein, a veterinarian with the EcoHealth Alliance who helped trap the bats, that victims, like shepherds who might seek shelter in the buildings, picked it up by breathing in dried bat guano -- similar to the way that Americans have been infected with hantavirus while sweeping up dried mouse droppings.

But it is also possible that an animal picked it up that way and then infected a human. Pigs, for instance, can get Nipah virus from bats and then pass it to humans in slaughterhouses.

Further tests on camels, sheep, goats, and a cow will be finished soon, said Dr W Ian Lipkin, head of Columbia University's Center for Infection and Immunity, which has already done 15 000 polymerase chain reaction tests tracking the virus. "It's a huge amount of work," he said.

It has been known for several months that bats in Africa and Eastern Europe carried viruses related to MERS, but the relevant virus had not been found in Middle Eastern bats before. Camels in Oman have shown antibodies to a similar virus.

Knowing that one bat had an identical virus is a start, but more testing will be needed, said Dr Ziad A Memish, the Saudi deputy health minister who was a co-author on the study and gave a presentation on the virus in Washington on Wednesday [21 Aug 2013].

The infected bat was in an abandoned house in a date palm orchard in Bisha, a small Saudi Arabian city. Investigators from Columbia and EcoHealth Alliance took samples there because the 1st known victim of the MERS outbreak was a businessman who had lived in Bisha and had his business, a large paint warehouse, nearby. The warehouse had a large garden with fruit trees and insects that attract many kinds of bats. The victim, a wealthy 60-year-old man, got sick in mid-June [2012] and died 2 weeks later, Dr Lipkin said.

The victim also owned 4 pet camels that were sampled, but those results are not in yet, Dr Lipkin added. Samples taken from livestock in countries with endemic foot-and-mouth disease must first be delivered to an Agriculture Department laboratory on Plum Island, Massachusetts, to be certified negative for foot-and-mouth before they can be released for further testing.

Those restrictions can add months to the testing process, Dr Memish said. That is one reason the bat samples were tested sooner, although other problems emerged: 1 of 2 frozen shipments of bat samples -- the one the positive bat was in -- was opened at Customs on entry into the United States and had thawed out by the time it reached Dr Lipkin's lab 48 hours later.

What was recovered from that sample, however, was a 100 percent match, which is virtually unheard of in virology, the study said.

The victim from Bisha had separate houses for his 3 wives and was building a 4th for a woman he planned to marry, "which suggests he was still vigorous," Dr Lipkin said.

But most of those killed by the new virus were old and had chronic conditions like diabetes or heart disease. Cases are being found of younger, healthier victims who often have milder symptoms, according to Dr Memish, so it may soon be established that the disease's mortality rate is much lower than 60 percent.

In his presentation Wednesday [21 Aug 2013], hosted in Washington by the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's Center for Health Security, Dr Memish said he only learned of the existence of the new virus in his own country when he read about it late last September [2013] on ProMED, an outbreak-alert service.

Dr Memish said that by then, it was too late to advise travelers not to come to the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, which draws 4.5 million pilgrims. "That put an incredible strain on our system," he said.

His department ordered all Saudi hospitals to look for and report unusual cases of pneumonia. The virus does not spread easily from person to person, but there have been case clusters in which family members or nurses and doctors who cared for patients were infected.

This year [2013], the kingdom has suggested that older people, very young children, and those in ill health or with suppressed immune systems not make the pilgrimage.

[The finding is presented in the last issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases, available at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/19/11/13-1172_article.htm.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) adds to the extensive list of deadly viruses transmitted by bats. Bats are reservoirs for rabies, _Filoviridae_ viruses such as Ebola and Marburg, and _Paramyxoviridae_ viruses such as Hendra and Nipah. Another coronavirus with a bat reservoir, SARS-CoV, caused great worldwide alarm a decade ago. SARS-CoV originated from Chinese horseshoe bats (Fam. _Rhinolophidae_) and evolved to a form that could be transmitted from human to human (airborne transmission), thus spreading quickly from China and generating widespread panic in 2002 and 2003. This pathogen caused 774 deaths and more than 8000 cases of illness. Bats were the carriers of this virus, but it is probably only passed to humans through intermediate hosts (the 1st animal host discovered was a civet in a live animal market).

So far, MERS-CoV has been transmitted human-to-human only in a few instances. The evolution of this virus must be tracked closely to anticipate and timely identify the emergence of novel lineages more capable of human-to-human transmission.

_Taphozous perforatus_, the Egyptian tomb bat, belongs to the Family _Emballonuridae_. Its natural habitat is dry savanna. It is found in Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Egypt, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, India, Iran, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.

[The following excerpts from the 'ahead of print' paper above may add some useful background:

"In October 2012 and April 2013, 3 agencies collected samples from bats in regions where MERS cases had been identified. The agencies are the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia, the Center for Infection and Immunity of Columbia University, and EcoHealth Alliance.

"During the October [2012] investigation, the team interviewed the family of an index case-patient in Bisha and collected samples from bats less than 12 km from his home, in an abandoned date palm orchard, and less than 1 km from his place of employment, a hardware store that fronted a garden and date palm orchard. Although neither family members nor employees recalled seeing bats, the team observed roosting bats and guano in abandoned wells and ruins within 12 km [7.5 mi] of his home and insectivorous bats at dusk in the garden behind his store. Over 3 weeks, 96 bats representing 7 species [for details, refer to the original text] were captured in mist nets and harp traps, then released after visual speciation and collection of morphometric measurements; wing punch biopsy samples; blood; throat swab samples; and rectal swab samples or fecal pellets. Samples were collected into viral transport medium or lysis buffer.

"CoV sequences were amplified from 220 of 732 roost feces samples and 7 of 91 rectal swab samples or fecal pellets. A product obtained by PCR amplification of nucleic acid from a fecal pellet of a _Taphozous perforatus_ bat captured in October 2012 in Bisha showed 100 percent nt identity to the human beta-CoV 2c EMC/2012 cloned from the index case-patient in Bisha."

In their conclusions, the following statement was included:
"We sampled only a small sample of bats in Saudi Arabia. Nonetheless, given the rarity of MERS-CoV sequences detected by our survey and the broad distribution of MERS cases throughout the Middle East, we speculate that there are probably other hosts. Future work should investigate additional bat and other wildlife species and domestic animals for CoV infection and potential linkage to human disease."

In a previous publication, researchers from the Universities of Stellenbosch (S. Africa) and Bonn (Germany) reported that a virus found in the feces of a bat in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal and Western Cape provinces was found more closely related to MERS-CoV than any other known virus (ProMED posting 20130725.1844412).

Information on additional investigations and (even preliminary) results, referring to the MERS-CoV in bats and in other potential animal hosts (particularly camels, sheep, goats, cattle, and cats) are anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS]
