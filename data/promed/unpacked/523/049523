1st Report of Pink Seed of Lentil and Chickpea Caused by _Erwinia
rhapontici_ in Canada.

Dis. 87:1398, 2003; published on-line as D-2003-0911-01N, 2003.
Accepted for publication 15 Aug 2003.
A new disease of lentil (_Lens culinaris_ Medik.) and chickpea
(_Cicer arietinum_ L.) caused by _Erwinia rhapontici_ (Millard)
Burkh. was found in seed samples from commercial fields in
Saskatchewan, Canada in 2002. Infected seeds had a pink or
pinkish-brown discoloration of the seed coat. Isolation from
surface-sterilized pink seeds resulted in bacterial cultures that
produced a water-soluble pink pigment on potato dextrose agar (PDA).
Four isolates from different lentil crops, LRC 8265, LRC 8310, LRC
8309, and LRC 8313 and one isolate from a chickpea crop, LRC 8266,
were tested as previously described (2). Results of the tests were
identical to those for pink bean isolates of _E. rhapontici_ (2) with
the following minor exceptions: all were negative for
Voges-Proskauer; LRC 8266 was positive for tagatose; LRC 8266, LRC
8309, and LRC 8313 were negative for lactose; and LRC 8266 and LRC
8309 were positive for 5-keto gluconate.
For pathogenicity tests, each isolate was inoculated into 30 pods
from 6 lentil plants (cv. Laird), 30 pods from 6 desi chickpea plants
(cv. Myles), and 30 pods from 6 kabuli chickpea plants (cv. Sanford)
by the method described for pink seed of pea (1) and bean (2). Each
pod was inoculated with 0.1 ml (0.2 ml for kabuli chickpeas) of
bacterial suspension, approximately 100 million CFU/ml, by injection
through the mid-rib at the basal end. The same number of uninoculated
and water-inoculated pods served as controls. Plants were kept in the
greenhouse (20 +/- 5 deg C) for 4 weeks, after which isolations of
the pathogen were performed as described above.
In duplicate experiments, all the isolates caused pink lesions on
pods and seeds of lentil, desi chickpea, and kabuli chickpea. The
frequency of infected seeds among the 5 isolates (4 lentil and one
chickpea) ranged from 50 to 100 percent on lentil, 73 to 100 percent
on desi chickpea, and 43 to 100 percent on kabuli chickpea. _E.
rhapontici_ was reisolated from seeds with lesions but not from
asymptomatic seeds.
The study demonstrates that in addition to pea (1) and common bean
(2), _E. rhapontici_ is also the causal agent of pink seed of lentil
and chickpea. The observation that lentil isolates can infect
chickpea and vice versa suggests that host specificity may be lacking
in _E. rhapontici_.
To our knowledge, this is the first record of _E. rhapontici_ on
lentil and chickpea.

[Infection of pulse crop seeds such as lentil and chickpea by
_Erwinia rhapontici_ (Er) is reported to cause reduced germination
and stunting of seedlings. Concern has been expressed by plant
pathologists regarding spread of Er to pulse crops in western Canada.
Plants are most susceptible to Er infection at the young pod stage.
Er overwintered well in experiments conducted in western Canada.
Viable Er cells were found in 47 percent of seeds and in 59 percent
of stems left on the soil surface during the winter of 2000-2001, and
survival percentage increased markedly in seed buried at a depth of 6
cm. The fungus is an opportunistic pathogen, reported also on bread
wheat, durum wheat, and onion. Use of disease-free seed is the best
method of disease management.
