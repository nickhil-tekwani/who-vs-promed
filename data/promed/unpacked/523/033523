I would like to add another aspect to diagnosis, clinical presentation and
treatment:
1. Did they test for _Borrelia recurrentis_ as well?
2. Did her son had brain MRI?
3. Did her son get antibiotic treatment which penetrates well the BBB [blood
brain barrier?
Three years ago, I had a 20 year old patient who had chronic CNS
manifestations (chronic fatigue-like) after being diagnosed and treated for
_Borrelia recurrentis_ with doxyxycline. CT was normal. Neurologic exam was
normal but neurophsychological evaluation was pathologic. MRI that I ordered
showed many ill defines lesions of possible demyelination. The patient
refused spinal tap and was lost from follow up.
Search of the medical literature reveals very few reports on long term (CNS)
manifestations of tetracycline treated _Borrelia recurrentis_. In two studies
from the mid forties (Ashbel R.: Observations on some strains of _Spirocheta
persica_ in Palestine, Ann of Trop Med and Parasitology, vol 36, 1942, p
97-101), researchers injected mice with _Borrelia recurrentis_. They examined
the brains of the animals for borreliae, and showed that viable borreliae
were existing there happily, hundreds of days after the end of the last
borrelial attack and clinical recovery. Probably well protected behind the
BBB. A paper in the JID [Journal of Infectious Diseases (Cadavid, Bundoc,
Barbour: Experimental Infection of the Mouse Brain by a Relapsing Fever
Borrelia Species: A Molecular Analysis: JID, 1993, 168:143-151) referred to
these findings by molecular biology technics.
I suggest that clinicians should be aware of this under-diagnosed
presentation, and that borreliosis should be treated [using antibiotics
that penetrate the blood brain barrier well.
