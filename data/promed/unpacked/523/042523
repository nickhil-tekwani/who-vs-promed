The Ministry of Health has confirmed there is a rubella outbreak in
Fiji. Ministry spokesperson Peni Namotu told FBC News that there are
11 confirmed cases of rubella -- most of which have been reported in
Suva.

Rubella -- also known as German measles -- can cause serious birth
defects or miscarriage and is highly contagious. Namotu says the
symptoms of rubella include a mild fever, rash, runny nose, sore
throat and often swollen lymph nodes with aching joints. Namotu says
the treatment for symptoms of rubella include rest and plenty of
fluids and if confirmed by the doctor then the person should stay at
home for 7 days.

He says rubella infection in pregnant women during the 1st 3 months of
pregnancy may result in the baby being born with birth defects or
congenital rubella syndrome. These birth defects include heart
defects, deafness, brain damage and eye problems, including
cataracts.

[The number of confirmed cases of rubella virus infection in Fiji has
increased from the 3 (2 females and a male aged between 19 and 24)
reported a week ago to the current total of 11 cases. It is not
revealed if any of the victims are pregnant women.

Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) is an important cause of severe
birth defects. When a woman is infected with the rubella virus early
in pregnancy, she has a 90 percent chance of passing the virus on to
her fetus. This can cause the death of the fetus, or it may cause CRS.
Even though it is a mild childhood illness, CRS causes many birth
defects. Deafness is the most common, but CRS can also cause defects
in the eyes, heart and brain. Rubella is spread in airborne droplets
when infected people sneeze or cough. Once a person is infected, the
virus spreads throughout the body in about 5 to 7 days. During this
time, pregnant women may pass the virus on to their fetuses. Rubella
is a vaccine-preventable disease.

More information on rubella and CRS and global statistics on rubella
vaccine uptake (up to 2009) can be accessed at the WHO website
(http://www.who.int/immunization_monitoring/diseases/rubella/en/index.html).
