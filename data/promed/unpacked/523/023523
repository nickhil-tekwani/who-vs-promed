[Correspondents have asked for medical literature references to mechanisms
which might account for GWS. We thank Pierre for providing these - Mod.JW
About the use of pyridostigmine (as prophylaxis against soman [nerve gas
attack) and an
increase in permeability of the blood-brain barrier:
- The Gulf War, stress and a leaky blood-brain barrier
NATURE MEDICINE, vol.2, No.12, December 1996 p.307
- Pyridostigmine brain penetration under stress enhances neuronal
excitability and induces early immediate transcriptional response
NATURE MEDICINE, vol.2, No.12, December 1996 pp.382-85
I know that a relationship between environmental toxins and a decrease in
immunological response has been established but I do not have original refs.
RACHEL'S ENVIRONMENT & HEALTH WEEKLY #528 & #536 gives some references
about 'immune toxins' - available via:
ftp://ftp.std.com/periodicals/rachel or
http://www.monitor.net/rachel/
1) R.Haley et al. from University of Texas published about Gulf War
Syndrome (split up into six syndromes) in JAMA, 15 Jan. 1997(1) (according
to an article in New Scientist, 18 Jan. 1997, p.8). His work was already
mentioned on ProMED-mail (Wed. 17 April 1995)
2)Abou-Donia from Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, stated that
pyridostigmine allowed DEET and permethrin [insect repellent & insecticide
used in the Gulf to enter the brain (New Scientist, 27 April 1996 p.4)
There are simularities in the discussions about CFS (chronic fatique
syndrome) and the discussions about Gulf war syndrome (Scientific American,
Sep. 1996 p.15: Mysterious Maladies - cited R.Aronowitz and C.Rosenberg).
I wondered if there are publications about NK cells, lymphocytes, CTL,
antibodies... in Gulf war veterans, or morbidity of cancer, auto-immunity
markers and spermatogenesis in this specific population. I did a search on
Paperchase; it gave 36 references about Gulf War Syndrome but not one about
alterations of the immune system. One ref. mentioned
botulism:
-Botulism and Gulf War syndrome [letter Lancet (1996 Jun 1) 347(9014):1561
