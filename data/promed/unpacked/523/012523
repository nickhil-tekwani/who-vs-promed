Confirmed and Suspected Cases of Hantavirus Infection in the 8th Region
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
On Tue 7 May 2002, the Public Health Institute confirmed a new
case of hantavirus [infection] in a patient hospitalized in the pediatric
intensive care unit of the Regional Clinical Hospital of Concepcion. The
case is a 9-year-old child, resident of the rural sector Balseadero de
Megrete, near the city of Los Angeles, who was admitted to the Victor Rios
Hospital in Los Angeles with typical symptoms of the disease.
According to information from the radio station Cooperativa, the child was
taken to the Regional Hospital in Conception, where there is specialized
equipment for treating hantavirus infections [one assumes this refers to
ventilatory assistance with severe respiratory distress seen with
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome - Mod.MPP]. In the meantime the child is in
stable condition. The Health Service of Biobio began an epidemiologic
investigation in the zone where the child resides, an area known for the
presence of the long-tailed rat, a carrier of the [hantavirus].
The health service is also investigating another suspect case in an adult
who is hospitalized in the Victor Rios Hospital, having been transferred
there from Santa Barbara.
High fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and muscle pains persisting more than 3
days may be symptoms of having been infected with the hantavirus, for which
immediate medical assistance is recommended, as early diagnosis and
treatment are urgent with this disease.

[The need for specialist treatment suggests that these patients are
suffering from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome rather than mild hantavirus
infection. The likely causal agent is the hantavirus Andes virus, which is
prevalent in Argentina and Chile and whose reservoir host is the
long-tailed pygmy rice rat _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_. - Mod.CP]
