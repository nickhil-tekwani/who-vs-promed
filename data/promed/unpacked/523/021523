[I am including the text of the latest OIE report and the OIE report from
May 5 which was not previously posted. Comparing the two reports
indicates the number of cases and deaths are up in all species as would be
expected this early in an outbreak. They have typed the FMD virus,
slaughter of exposed animals has started and ring vaccination of 3/4 of a
million animals is underway. I query, along with my fellow moderator MHJ,
what is going on in Asia with FMD? - Mod.PC
