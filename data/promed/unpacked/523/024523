Health officials are reminding people to be vigilant about taking
steps to prevent the spread of eastern equine encephalitis in
Michigan.

The Kalamazoo Gazette reports there have been recent reports of 7
more dead horses from the disease. They include 2 in Calhoun County
and 1 each in Allegan, Kalamazoo, Jackson, Eaton, and Shiawassee
counties.

Lab testing in recent months has confirmed 42 Michigan horses with
the mosquito borne disease. Another 77 have been diagnosed with
clinical signs.

The disease is rare but can be deadly among humans. Last month
[August 2010], Michigan health officials reported that lab tests
confirmed that 3 people contracted the disease.

Health officials say people should take steps to avoid being bitten
by mosquitoes and horses should be vaccinated.

[The state of Michigan in the Great Lakes Region of the US can be
located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at

The counties mentioned are located in southern Michigan and can be

Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is preventable. In horses, it
requires at least 2 initial vaccinations and then boosters every 6
months in areas likely to have active disease. The protective titer
of the EEE vaccine wanes quicker than other equine encephalitis
titers.

Mosquito repellents made for horses can be used on the animals in
accordance with the label directions.

Human beings should dress accordingly, wearing long sleeves, avoiding
dusk and dawn exposure when mosquitoes may be more active, and using
insect repellant with DEET. Elimination of mosquito breeding sites is
critical to reducing the mosquito population. Small puddles, such as
those inside of an old tire, or a constant puddle in the garden or
flower bed, or even unclean water buckets for pets or horses can
serve as breeding grounds for mosquitoes.

The disease is generally preventable in human beings and in pets. - Mod.TG]
