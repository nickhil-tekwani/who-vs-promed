A man with symptoms of having contracted yellow fever (YF) died in the
Province of Misiones (north east [Argentina]), near the border with
Paraguay, where the disease has now caused 7 deaths, according to a medical
source.

The victim was a 39 year old man who was cutting trees near San Vicente, an
area considered a [yellow fever] risk zone, where another YF case was
detected at the beginning of this month [March 2008].

According to a medical source in Obera, where the man was taken several
days previously, the cause of death was due to "multiple organ failure with
coagulation problems."

The Misiones subsecretary of health, Carlos Baez, told the press that it is
necessary to wait for the laboratory results to confirm that the death of
the man was due to YF. Baez confirmed that there were 4 other suspected
[YF] cases in the same locality.

The national Ministry of Health sent infectious disease specialists to the
region to help with patient care and preventive measures.

Several weeks ago Misiones province initiated a massive YF vaccination
campaign, following the occurrence of some 20 cases of YF in Paraguay,
where the disease has caused the death of 7 people, according to official data.

[2] Paraguay: case

The number of yellow fever (YF) fatal cases so far this year [2008] in
Paraguay has increased to 7, with the death of an 18 year old woman who was
admitted to the Infectious Diseases Institute hospital, as confirmed by the
minister of health, Oscar Martinez. Last night [10 Mar 2008] Martinez
reported the death at the Silvio Pettirossi airport during the arrival of
50 000 [YF vaccine] doses donated by Cuba.

According to sources in the Ministry of Health, the dead patient was
brought [to Asuncion] from San Pedro (Central) where the focus of YF began
and where 2 family members of the young woman also died from the same disease.

"Up until yesterday [10 Mar 2008], there were 6 deaths, 22 confirmed [YF]
cases, and 10 suspected [cases]," indicated the minister.

The [health] authorities have reported that to date [11 Mar 2008] there
have been 3 deaths reported in the San Pedro region, the same number in the
Laurelty de San Lorenz neighborhood (20 km [12.5 mi] east of Asuncion) and
one death in Caaguazu, also in the central part of the country.

Also, they are waiting for the results of the analysis of 2 people who died
and presented various symptoms of the disease transmitted by the mosquito
_Aedes aegypti_ in the urban zone and _Aedes albopictus_ in the forest.
[Although _Ae. albopictus_ may be present in and around buildings and
nearby forests, it is more likely that the YF virus in the sylvan cases was
transmitted by _Haemagogus janthinomys_. - Mod.TY]

The minister of health also recommended vaccination for the residents of
both the regions where YF cases have been registered as well as people in
the border areas with Brazil and Argentina, where there also have been
cases of YF reported.

The government of Paraguay decreed a state of national emergency in
mid-February [2008], confronting the risk of spread of foci of the disease,
which has not been registered [in Paraguay] for 34 years [in the past].

The government has purchased a lot of 2 million doses [of YF vaccine] from
a fund administered by the World Health Organization (WHO) to expand its
immunization program, and is expecting on 15 Mar [2008] the arrival in the
country, of another 600 000 doses of vaccine provided by the Pan American
Health Organization (PAHO).

The Ministry of Public Health of Paraguay confirmed that in fact 192

Pedro [provinces]. Of these 192 cases, 157 are considered mild, 5 are
moderate, and 4 are serious; 19 are under investigation and 7 were

allergic skin reactions and infections where the vaccine was applied.
