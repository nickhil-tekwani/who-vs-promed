Early release: the first 100 hospitalized severe complicated influenza
cases caused by 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in Taiwan 2009/09/25
-----------------------------------------------
Abstract:
To understand the features of the severe complicated influenza patients
caused by 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1), we retrospectively reviewed the
medical records of the 1st 100 laboratory-confirmed cases (by date of
onset), analyzed all clinical variables and described their clinical and
epidemiologic characteristics. The cases had onset dates from [2 Jul 2009
to 29 Aug 2009]; half of them were adults and the other half were children.
The median age was 16.5 years. 38 had preexisting medical conditions; 6 of
the 50 adults were morbidly obese; 8 of the 50 children were obese, and 2
women were pregnant. The most common initial presentations were fever (99
per cent) and cough (93 per cent). 89 patients had viral pneumonia; 23 were
complicated with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, and
9 were treated with concomitant support by extra-corporeal membrane
oxygenation. By [18 Sep 2009], 82 patients recovered and were discharged
from the hospitals; 9 were still hospitalized, and the remaining 9 patients
(including 2 obese patients and one pregnant woman) died. The median time
between onset of symptoms and 1st doctor visit was one day, and the median
hospital stay for those who had been discharged was 6 days. The average
duration from onset of symptoms to the date of rapid testing, admission, or
prescription of oseltamivir for patients with onset after [15 Aug 2009] was
shorter than those with onset before [15 Aug 2009]. In conclusion, most of
the severe complicated influenza patients caused by 2009 pandemic influenza
A (H1N1) were children and young to middle-aged adults; overweight and
pregnancy posed higher risk to these patients. The preventive and control
measures conducted by the public health sector have effectively accelerated
diagnosis and treatment. However, quality of medical care remains to be
improved to further reduce the number of severe complicated influenza cases
and mortality.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr Angela Song-En Huang and Dr Jen-Hsiang
Chuang for alerting us to this document. As with other reports on
hospitalized/severe cases of influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus
infection, the high risk groups appear to include younger ages, pregnant
women, and obese individuals (see ProMED-mail postings below). Of concern
is the stated figure that 89 (89 per cent) of the severe cases had viral
pneumonia, a significantly higher percentage than reported elsewhere (see
ProMED-mail postings below). The recent ProMED-mail posting on FLAARDS [flu
A-associated acute respiratory disease syndrome] described in Australia and
New Zealand mentions that 20 per cent of hospitalized patients had severe
respiratory disease with FLAARDS requiring intensive care unit management
of the cases [Influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (61): FLAARDS 20091001.3419].
Of note is the recent description of 29 per cent of severe cases in the USA
with secondary bacterial pneumonia [Influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (60):
bacterial coinfection 20090930.3410].
