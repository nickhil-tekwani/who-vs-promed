["European foulbrood (abbreviated EFB) is a bacterial disease that effects honey bee larvae before the capped stage. EFB is characterized by dead and dying larvae which can appear curled upwards, brown or yellow, melted, and/or dried out and rubbery. The causative bacteria, _Melissococcus plutoniu_, is ingested by honey bee larvae after which the bacterium competes for food inside the larvae. If the bacteria out-competes the larva, the larva will die before the cell is capped. Alternatively, the bee may survive until adulthood if the larvae have sufficient food resources. European foulbrood should not be confused with American foulbrood (AFB), which is caused by a different bacteria that produces different symptoms and control requirements." See http://articles.extension.org/pages/23693/european-foulbrood:-a-bacterial-disease-affecting-honey-bee-brood.

In 2016 Romania reported European foulbrood of honey bees in the "Judetul" (County) of Mures and Prahova, see OIE annual report at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/semestrial/review?year=2016&semester=0&wild=0&country=ROU&this_country_code=ROU&detailed=1. - Mod.CRD
