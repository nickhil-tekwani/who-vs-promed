GASTROENTERITIS - CUBA (HAVANA): REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

Various hospitals of Havana have taken emergency measures to attend to the
increased number of patients affected with diarrhea and vomiting, seen
principally in children and elderly. The Institute of Hygiene and
Epidemiology has alerted the population to boil water and maintain the most
strict measures of environmental hygiene in order to
combat the epidemic produced by a bacterium, presumed to be transmitted by
oral contact with foods infected by rodents and insects, as well as by
contamination of the waters which feed the aqueducts of the capital. The
disease produces strong vomiting, diarrhea and stomach pains, and in the
more severe phase, is able to cause dehydration to the person and put [the
person] in lethal danger.
[This article is somewhat confusing referring to "a bacterial virus named
Sachelis". Is there any information as to the etiology of this outbreak
(i.e. Shigellosis vs. another food or water-borne organism) and the extent
of the outbreak. The article suggests this is a city wide outbreak, given
the boil water alert. - MPP]
