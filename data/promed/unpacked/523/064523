A 61-year-old man from regional New South Wales has become the 5th person in Australia to die from the rare mosquito-borne virus Japanese encephalitis.

[DK] from Corowa died at Albury Base Hospital on 20 May [2022] after contracting the virus on the New South Wales-Victorian border in mid-February [2022].

DK had been placed on life support after developing a severe form of the virus [infection].

His wife, who spent almost every day by his bedside, confirmed her husband's passing.

"Without possibility of life quality, DK chose palliation to journey to heaven on his own terms," his wife told The Border Mail. "Such courage and dignity; a mark of the much-loved man in our Corowa community."

An outpouring of tributes have flowed from the Corowa community.

To date 37 people have been infected by Japanese encephalitis across Australia, with New South Wales accounting for 13 cases.

Japanese encephalitis virus is spread to humans and other animals through bites from infected mosquitoes.

Although those who are bitten by the mosquito rarely develop symptoms, those who do have a 30 per cent chance of dying, according to the World Health Organization.

Symptoms can include severe neurological illness with headache, convulsions and reduced consciousness in some cases.

[Fatalities due to Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus infection in Australia this year (2022) have been very few. Unfortunately, the case above is one of them, after a prolonged illness. Most JE virus infections are asymptomatic or mild febrile cases. As the weather becomes cooler and vector mosquitoes less active, transmission of JE virus is expected to decline, as apparently is the situation. The open question now is if JEV will become established in any or all of the 4 affected states. Ongoing surveillance of piggeries and mosquitoes should provide evidence of the continuing presence of the virus in the 4 states. Providing adequate surveillance over the very large geographic 4-state area of the outbreak will be a challenge for surveillance efforts. One hopes that the virus will disappear in the affected area and transmission will cease permanently. We shall see if it does. - Mod.TY
