South African scrub typhus should not be confused with scrub typhus,
the disease caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a disease endemic in
south east Asia and Japan. _Rickettsia africae_ (mentioned in
ProMED-mail as causing the South African scrub typhus) is a newly
described Rickettsia species that belongs to the spotted fever
biogroup Rickettsia. It has been reported in southern Africa.
It causes African tick bite fever and is transmitted by _Amblyomma_
ticks. Multiple tache noire, lymphadenopathy, lymphangitis, and
edema, but no rash or a discrete rash characterizes African tick bite
fever. It is a frequent but benign disease that clinicians should
consider when presented with febrile patients returning from southern
Africa.
Contracting rickettsioses by travel is not unusual. A recent
outbreak of this disease was seen in U.S. Army troops deployed to
Botswana. In the coming issue of the EID journal, "Tick
-Transmitted Infections in Transvaal: Consider _Rickettsia africae_"
[will appear. The article describes European tourists who
contracted South African scrub typhus while on a visit [there.
_R. africae_ is a close but distinct relative of _Rickettsia
conorii_, the causative agent of boutonneuse fever or Mediterranean
spotted fever that is transmitted by a _Rhipicephalus_ tick. _R.
africae_ has a distinct natural cycle and can be phenotypically
distinguished from the other spotted fever biogroup by serotyping
using monoclonal antibodies, [using immunoblotting. Sequencing of
the 16S rRNA gene shows genotypic differences.
