[FMD is endemic in Cambodia. According to Cambodia's detailed monthly
reports to the OIE, FMD was recorded there during each month of 2003,
affecting 3023 cows, 528 buffalo, and 351 pigs in 8 provinces. The cattle
population of Cambodia is approximately 2.9 million; buffalo, 0.6 million;
and pigs 2.1 million.
The last FMD virus typing of samples from Cambodia was carried out at the
World Reference Laboratory (Pirbright, UK) in 2000; serotype O was
identified. - Mod.AS]
