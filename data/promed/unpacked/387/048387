On 6 Oct 2004 at the railway station of Sants de Barcelona, a blue
paper bag was stolen from the owner of a clinical laboratory. It
contained 5 glass tubes, 15cm long x 2cm wide, with black stoppers,
containing cultures of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. They were
wrapped in absorbent paper inside an opaque white plastic container
with a black double cap. This was wrapped in brown parcel paper, with
a letter describing the contents, which are highly contagious.

The finder is asked to contact urgently the Cuerpo Nacional de
Policia, tel. 091, the local police, tel. 092, and the Servicio de
Emergencias de la Generalitat, tel. 112.

[Perhaps bioterrorists should be the least of our concerns about
letting dangerous microbes loose. We have seen how SARS got out of
secure labs on more than one occasion by infecting researchers -- see
ref. below -- and now we see how carelessly transported disease
agents can be stolen, and probably thrown away in the trash as
worthless, to possibly infect trash collectors and through them the
community. - Mod.JW]
