China said Wednesday [6 Jan 2021] it was still negotiating with the World Health Organization [WHO] the dates and itinerary for a visit by international experts looking into origins of COVID-19, after the head of the agency criticized Beijing for not finalizing permissions for the mission.

China's position on the hunt for the origins of the pandemic "has always been open and responsible," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told a daily news briefing in Beijing. She said that China has a close cooperation with WHO. However, the dates and itinerary need to be finalized, she said.

"The origins problem is very complex. To ensure that the work of the global experts group in China is successful, we need to carry out the necessary procedures and relevant concrete plans. Currently, both sides are still in negotiations on this," Hua said. "I understand that it's not just a visa problem and the actual date and itinerary. Both sides are still in close communication."

China's disease experts are currently busy with multiple small-scale clusters and outbreaks reported in the past couple of weeks, she added. "Our experts are wholeheartedly in the stressful battle to control the epidemic," she said.

An international team of experts had been due to visit the central city of Wuhan in January [2021], where the pandemic first appeared a year ago.

WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Tuesday [5 Jan 2021] that members of the international scientific team began departing from their home countries over the last 24 hours as part of an arrangement between WHO and the Chinese government.

"Today [Tue 5 Jan 2021], we learned that Chinese officials have not yet finalized the necessary permissions for the team's arrival in China," Tedros said during a news conference in Geneva on Tuesday [5 Jan 2021]. "I'm very disappointed with this news, given that 2 members had already begun their journeys, and others were not able to travel at the last minute, but had been in contact with senior Chinese officials," he said.

The Chinese government has been strictly controlling all research at home into the origins of the virus, an AP investigation found, and state-owned media have played up reports that suggest the virus could have originated elsewhere.

The World Health Organization's international mission to China to investigate the origins of COVID-19 will explore all avenues and is not looking to find "guilty" parties, a team member told AFP.

Investigators will head to China in January [2021] and to Wuhan, where the 1st cases were detected 12 months ago in the pandemic that has swept the world, causing giant global health and economic crises.

"The meetings we had so far with Chinese colleagues were really productive and very good," said Fabian Leendertz from the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's central disease control body. "My impression, at the moment, is that the Chinese -- on the government, but also on the population level -- they're really interested in finding out what happened."

Leendertz, 48, is an expert in zoonoses -- infectious diseases that cross the species barrier -- and is among 10 eminent scientists tasked by the WHO with trying to find the origins of the novel coronavirus and work out how it jumped from animals to humans.

A year after the 1st cluster was detected in Wuhan, [the scientists] will travel to China for the 1st time on a mission expected to last between 5 and 6 weeks -- the 1st 2 spent in quarantine. The 10 scientists will also be accompanied by Peter Ben Embarek, a WHO expert on food safety and zoonoses.

"This is not about finding a guilty country or a guilty authority," said Leendertz. "This is about understanding what happened to avoid that in the future, to reduce the risk."

Leendertz said that viruses jump from animals to humans every year, all over the world.

"It was just bad luck that this was such a nasty virus," the German said.

"We are starting in Wuhan, because this is where the most solid 1st data are available," said Leendertz. "From there, we follow the tracks wherever they take us."

While he acknowledged that "the fresher the tracks are, the better," trained vet Leendertz said that even a year on it was "still possible to narrow down the scenario." He added that all avenues remained open in terms of scientific analysis.

An epidemiologist and an animal health specialist from the WHO went to China in July [2020] on a scoping mission to lay the groundwork for the broader international investigation.

Since the end of October [2020], the 10 experts have held regular virtual meetings with Chinese scientists working along the same lines.

Leendertz cautioned that "we should not have the expectation that after this 1st visit to China sometime in January [2021], the team will come back with conclusive results." However, he hopes the team will return from China with a "concrete plan" for Phase 2 of the investigation, which will look at what else was needed to pinpoint the transmission event where the virus jumped from animal to a human.

Leendertz explained that the "biggest part" of the work, in particular the "practical" basics, would be done by Chinese experts. The international mission is "there to support" them and also "give transparency to the rest of the world."

While scientists generally believe that bats were the original host species of the virus, the intermediate animal between bats and humans is not yet known.

Leendertz said the team would go "back in time" by examining various human swabs kept by the Chinese authorities and serum collections from blood donors to see if people had been exposed to the virus before the 1st cluster was recorded in December 2019. Another approach will be to determine the role played by the Wuhan wet market, where live exotic animals were bought and sold.

The expert in the epidemiology of highly pathogenic microorganisms said he was "pretty sure we will find out somehow what happened." But he said an answer "may take some time," with no time frame put on the investigation. In the meantime, he hoped that politics would stay "as far as possible" from the mission.

[A recent publication of a UK media article addressing the origin of China's COVID-19 pandemic may have been, according to a Chinese media response, at the background of the last-minute difficulties in the full and timely realization of the mentioned WHO experts' mission to China. References for the UK article (1) and the Chinese response (2) are as follows:

(1) Sherwell P: "Coronavirus: Scientists cast doubt on WHO's China mission to find COVID-19 origin in Wuhan." The Sunday Times. 3 Jan 2021. https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/scientists-cast-doubt-on-whos-china-mission-to-find-virus-origin-ftbtnbj9t.
(2) Qian Q: "WHO's team of experts plans to arrive in China this month to investigate; British media quick to publish 'guilty inference.'" Guancha (Shanghai). 3 Jan 2021. https://www.guancha.cn/internation/2021_01_03_576651.shtml [in Chinese, machine trans., Rapp.DS]

The current WHO's experts mission was preceded by 2 earlier WHO missions to China. The 1st one, "WHO-China Joint Experts Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)," consisted of 25 national and international experts from China, Germany, Japan, Korea, Nigeria, Russia, Singapore, the United States of America, and WHO. The mission was implemented over a 9-day period, 16-24 Feb 2020; its 40-page report was published on 28 Feb 2020. The report was presented and discussed in the commentary of 20200312.7081842.

On 10 Jul 2020, a 2-person team, an epidemiologist and an animal health expert, travelled to China to address the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic while discussing with Chinese officials the scope of a larger, interdisciplinary experts mission to address the origin of the pandemic. The current mission is the outcome of the deliberations that followed the visit and involved 3 international agencies (WHO, OIE, FAO) and China's government; its terms of reference are presented in an 8-page document titled "WHO-Convened Global Study of the Origins of SARS-CoV-2: Terms of Reference for the China Part," which carries the date of 30 Jul 2020 and was eventually published by the WHO as a "country mission" on 5 Nov 2020 (https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/who-convened-global-study-of-the-origins-of-sars-cov-2).

The composition of the team, presenting an interdisciplinary, One Health approach, has been published by WHO as follows:

Prof. Dr. Thea Fisher, MD, DMSc (PhD) (Nordsaellands Hospital, Denmark)
Prof. John Watson (Public Health England, United Kingdom)
Prof. Dr. Marion Koopmans, DVM PhD (Erasmus MC, Netherlands)
Prof. Dr. Dominic Dwyer, MD (Westmead Hospital, Australia)
Vladimir Dedkov, PhD (Institute Pasteur, Russia)
Dr. Hung Nguyen, PhD (International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), Viet Nam)
PD. Dr. med vet. Fabian Leendertz (Robert Koch-Institute, Germany)
Dr. Peter Daszak, PhD (EcoHealth Alliance, USA)
Dr. Farag El Moubasher, PhD (Ministry of Public Health, Qatar)
Prof. Dr. Ken Maeda, PhD, DVM (National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan)
(The above and additional relevant information is available at https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus/who-recommendations-to-reduce-risk-of-transmission-of-emerging-pathogens-from-animals-to-humans-in-live-animal-markets).

The visit of the team to Wuhan, the epicenter of the pandemic during its earliest phase, is expected to include the 2 laboratories involved in the virologic investigations and research: the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory (Level 4) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Biosafety Laboratory (Level 2) in Wuhan's Municipal Center for Disease Control (CDC). Both are known to have been engaged in bat-derived samples.

A visit to the Yuanan seafood market is of less significance. As reported in 20200102.6866757, on 2 Jan 2020 it became known that the "undiagnosed pneumonia" was attributed to wildlife sales in the local South China seafood market in Wuhan, which was closed. Going back to the said earliest posting on the issue, we come across the following piece of information, published by the South China Morning Post on NewYear's day, 1 Jan 2020: "Law enforcement officers wearing face masks were on guard outside the market on Wednesday [1 Jan 2020] morning as seafood vendors were allowed to remove their stocks," the official Yangtze Daily reported. If such was the case factually, and if the "stocks" referred to all animal species kept on the market, namely mammals/avian on top of seafood, it means that "standstill" was not applied. In such case, the odds that the animals, kept on the market, were eventually tested are poor if not negligible. The later testing of "environmental" samples collected in the market could not disclose their origin. It remains, however, to be clarified if unowned animals on the market's and surrounding premises, e.g., stray cats, rodents, and, possibly, bats, have been sampled and tested.

Hopefully, the expert team will be able to fulfill its mission at the earliest for the benefit of us all. - Mod.AS
