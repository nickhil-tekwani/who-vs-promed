The death toll from bubonic plague in Uganda continues to rise as the
government struggles to come up with a clear response even though
early signs of the disease were detected at the beginning of 2008. At
least 68 people have died since February 2008 when the plague was 1st
reported, and now health experts warn that it could spread rapidly in
the absence of an adequate response from health workers and local
communities. About 32 000 people are at risk of acquiring the disease
if they do not take precautions.

The outbreak was initially restricted to one district but has now
spread to 2 others, where 73 cases have been reported. Arua District
Health Officer Dr Patrick Anguzu said the area has been registering a
few cases every year, but this year the numbers started rising,
reaching alarming levels in August 2008.

Dr William Mbabazi of the World Health Organization said the rising
rates are due to poor hygiene and sanitation because people do not
clean their houses, allowing bacteria-infected wild rats to find a
conducive environment in dirty homes, spreading the infected fleas.
Domestic rats then picking the fleas and due to their contact with
humans, the fleas pass on the disease.

The plague, which mainly affects women and children, has spread into
the districts of Arua and Nebbi, where residents still live in mud
huts. The WHO says the casualties in these districts are victims of a
cultural belief that women and children must sleep on the floor while
the men sleep on beds.
