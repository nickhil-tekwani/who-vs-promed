East African Community Meeting to Discuss Ebola Outbreak
--------------------------------------------------------
ARUSHA: The East African Community (EAC) partners Kenya, Uganda and
Tanzania have convened an urgent meeting of health experts to assess the
spread of Ebola hemorrhagic fever for 2 days beginning Thu 30 Nov 2000 in
Arusha. Ebola hemorrhagic fever has already killed 120 out of 340 people
confirmed to have contracted the deadly disease in Gulu, Uganda over the
past 3 months. Of the first 31 victims, 3 were student nurses who treated
Ebola patients in Gull's Lacor Hospital. Dr. Nyamajeje Weggoro, a senior
EAC official, told Internews that the meeting would chart out a common
strategy on how to combat the deadly disease. "The main thrust is to
assess the spread of Ebola in the region and the possible sources of the
disease beyond the EA borders," Dr. Weggoro said. He said the meeting
would put in place common measures to curb Ebola's spread from Uganda to
the other 2 member countries. The ECA official also said the experts would
discuss how to mobilize local and foreign resources required to contain the
disease.
Fears of cross-border infections between Uganda and Kenya arose last week
when Ugandan health authorities informed their Kenyan counterparts that at
least 7 Kenyans had attended the funeral of an Ebola fever victim across
the border and therefore could have come into contact with the killer
virus. Tanzanian health authorities reported 5 suspected cases in the
Mwanza, Kagera and Dar es Salaam regions with symptoms of the killer
disease on 22 Nov 2000, but said that there "was no conclusive evidence to
confirm Ebola virus infection." "Tanzania is taking the cases very
seriously until it is proved otherwise," Mariam Mwafisi, Permanent
Secretary in the Health Ministry, said.

Parliament Demands Compensation for Nurses
------------------------------------------
KAMPALA: A total of 6 nurses in Lacor Hospital, Gulu, have died from Ebola
hemorrhagic fever in the last 10 days, bringing to 10 the number of deaths
[among nurses since the epidemic began on 13 Oct 2000. A highly-placed
medical source said hospital staff went on strike last Wednesday because of
the new deaths, but the stoppage was called off after a closed meeting with
Ministry of Health officials.
At a Press Conference in Kampala yesterday, Assistant Commissioner of
Health Services, Dr. Alex Opio, said he could neither confirm nor deny
figures of nurses' deaths. But he said 10 nurses had died since the
disease broke out. An inter-ministerial Ebola Task Force is examining the
nurses' deaths and the possibility of compensation. "The Task Force is to
act within the laws governing the profession," Opio said. The nurses are
among 28 people whose deaths, apparently from Ebola fever, have been
recorded in Gulu since 18 Nov 2000. Between 24 Nov 2000 and 27 Nov 2000
alone, 15 people died in Gulu and another in Masindi, according to the
Ministry. "The number is unacceptable to us and we are doing everything to
bring it down," Opio said yesterday. Just when health officials were
confident that the situation was under control, some of the highest figures
in a single week have been reported, though Masindi and Mbarara reported no
new cases or deaths in the last 24 hours. The overall death toll is set at
149 out of 367 cases. A total of 26 patients remain hospitalized.
Meanwhile, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on Social Services,
Dr. Timothy Mutesasira, has demanded that the Workman's Compensation Law
apply to the nurses who died of Ebola fever. Minister of State for Health,
Beatrice Wabudeya, and other ministry officials were meeting the Committee
to discuss a bill for the establishment of the Health Services Commission,
2000. Wabudeya said she is consulting with the Solicitor General on how
the law relates to the deceased nurses.
Dr. Sam Zaramba said the new deaths were due to laxity by health workers,
lack of logistics due to unfulfilled pledges, and cultural habits. He
discouraged newly-discharged people from engaging in sex, arguing that
tests had found semen to contain the Ebola virus after 21 days.

Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever in Uganda - WHO Update 32
--------------------------------------------------
As of Wed 29 Nov 2000, the Ugandan Ministry of Health has reported
cumulative figures for Gulu district of 354 cases and 140 deaths.
The mobile teams in Gulu district are intensifying disease control
activities and focusing particularly on areas where there has been recent
disease activity. They are tracing and closely following up contacts of
the most recent laboratory confirmed cases, as well as continuing
case-finding activities in the district. Additional activities have been
initiated to enhance public health education in Gulu district. Messages
and discussions about the disease will continue on the radio and in film
shows, with new drama and musical events planned to further increase the
level of awareness about the disease.
A total of 5 suspected cases was reported from Tanzania. These cases were
investigated and clinical samples sent to the National Institute for
Virology, South Africa. The preliminary results for all cases are negative.
WHO recommends no special restrictions on travel or trade to or from
Uganda. Many countries have routine health regulations concerning travel
and trade. No specific measures with respect to Ebola hemorrhagic fever
are warranted or advised.

[The statistics released by WHO represent laboratory-confirmed cases and
deaths and take precedence over the sometimes conflicting figures emanating
from local and regional health officials. The suspected cases in Tanzania
have proved negative, and there is still no evidence that the disease has
spread beyond the Gulu neighborhood, apart from the so-far-contained small
outbreaks in Masindi and Mbarara. - Mod.CP
