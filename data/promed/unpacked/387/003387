One person has died and 30 others admitted to
Kisoro Hospital after a cholera outbreak in a
refuge camp at Bunagana in Kisoro district.
The district LC5 Chairman Philemon Mateke asked
over 7000 Congolese refugees currently camped at
Nyakabande Camp to maintain maximum sanitation to
avoid the pandemic breaking out in their camp.
He said they should observe precautionary
measures like washing hands after visiting the
toilet, avoiding raw foods, and to always use
clean utensils if they are to have good health.
"I have received a report that 3 people from this
camp have been rushed to Kisoro hospital with
symptoms similar to those of cholera patients.
You must exercise maximum care," Dr Mateke said.
He gave the refugees 2 days to prepare to return to their homes.
He said they had talked to the province governor
and he assured them that the place is now safe for their return.
However, the refugees protested saying they
should be taken to gazetted [official?] refugee
camps in Uganda; others opted to remain at
Nyakabande despite the disease and food shortage.
Dr Mateke said he has been told by Kisoro
Hospital officials that the over 30 cholera
patients admitted are improving steadily and the
majority of them are Congolese nationals.

Cholera was discovered in Lusaka for the 1st time
with one person having died of it in the Zambian
capital city on Thu, 4 Jan 2006, a spokesman of
the country's Health Ministry said here on Fri, 5
Jan 2007. Canisius Banda, a spokesman, said that
12 other patients have been admitted to clinics in Lusaka.
There have been cases of cholera reported in some
other parts of the country, with Chiengi in
Luapula Province suffering the most from the
water-borne disease. Zambia closed its border
with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in
November 2006 to prevent spread of cholera after
5 people died of it in Chiengi which borders DRC. The border has been reopened.

Cholera cases in Angola have been rapidly
increasing, from 50 cases per day in September
2006 to 80 cases per day in October 2006. A total
of 57 570 cases, with 2354 deaths, have been
reported since the beginning of the epidemic in
February 2006. The continued increase of cases,
particularly in provinces that did not have
cholera before, confirms high vulnerability of
communities attributed to limited access to water
and sanitation (WatSan) as well as deteriorated public health conditions.
A total of 260 volunteers in Huila, Uige, Kwaza
Norte, Benguela, Luanda, Kwanza Sul and Malange
provinces were trained in social mobilization.
The volunteers reached 10 253 households with
health and hygiene education activities and
distributed 22 374 information, education and
communication (IEC) materials on cholera
prevention as well as 19 771 liters of
hypochlorite for water purification. The
established partnership with stakeholders,
particularly the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) and the Ministry of Health (MoH), has
been strengthened through collaboration in
planning and implementation. This operation is
aligned with the International Federation's
Global Agenda, which sets out 4 broad goals to
meet the Federation's mission to "improve the
lives of vulnerable people by mobilizing the power of humanity".

Cholera has become endemic in areas surrounding
Kivu and Tanganyika lakes of the South Kivu
Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo, since
it first hit in 1998. In 2006 alone, 3 outbreaks
were registered. The first occurred in Uvira
during week 10, affecting 760 people and killing
10 others. The 2nd occurred in Fizi and Uvira
from week 28 to week 36, affecting 541 and
killing 3 people. The 3rd outbreak hit Bukavu
(with 700 000 inhabitants) as from week 41. From
then, the number of cases has been increasing and
the epidemic line was crossed during week 44,
with over 65 cases registered. 142 cases were
registered in week 47 (with no deaths) in 3
health zones of Bukavu; 126 in Kadutu, 4 in
Bagira and 12 in Ibanda. By week 48, the number
of cases increased to 246 and 10 deaths,
translating to a case fatality rate (CFR) of 4 percent.
This situation is exacerbated by poor access to
potable water, precarious hygiene and sanitation
conditions as well as failure to respect
prevention measures, especially in the suburbs of
Kadutu which is the most affected area. In
addition, the slow down of sensitization
activities that were initiated during the last
outbreak by "community relays" and Red Cross
volunteers contributed to the resurgence of the disease.
