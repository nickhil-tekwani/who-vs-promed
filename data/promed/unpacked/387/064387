Danish researchers are puzzled by what is believed to be a new disease in
dairy cows, tentatively known as complex vertebral malformation. The
disease is characterized by malformations in aborted fetuses and in
prematurely born, stillborn and neonatal Holstein calves. The researchers
believe that the defect is inherited as a simple recessive trait, but U.S.
researchers want more information.

[Would any members with information please share it with us. While such
conditions may well be genetic, and thus inappropriate for ProMED-mail
posting, in my experience there are a number of teratogenic infections of
livestock that might be involved in such a condition. Additionally, we can
always be surprised by a new one. Too often I have read genetic
explanations for what have later turned out to be fetal infections. I would
rather make a fool of myself than miss a new infectious disease. - Mod.MHJ]
