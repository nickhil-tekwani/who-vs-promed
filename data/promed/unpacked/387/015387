[The OIE suspended Colombia's status of "FMD free zone where vaccination is practised".

According to the OIE - FMD portal: "Following an immediate notification received from the OIE Delegate of Colombia on an outbreak of FMD in Arauca Department, the "FMD free status where vaccination is practised" for a zone of Colombia resulting from the merge of 5 distinct zones designated by the Delegate of Colombia in documents addressed to the OIE Director General in January 2003, in December 2004 (2 zones), in January 2007 and in January 2009, and as recognized by the OIE World Assembly of Delegates in terms of Resolution No. 19 in May 2009, is suspended with effect from 11 Jun 2017" (http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/official-disease-status/fmd/lossreinstatement-of-status/).
