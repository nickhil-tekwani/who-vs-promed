Viet Nam: Suspected Human Case of Avian Influenza Not Confirmed
-----------------------------------------------
A Vietnamese teacher who died last week [4th week December 2005] had
a lung infection and not, as suspected, H5N1 avian influenza virus
infection, state media reported on Wednesday [28 Dec 2005]. Tests at
the Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City showed the 36-year-old man
from the southern province of Soc Trang did not have the virus,
Health Ministry official Nguyen Van Binh was quoted as saying.
Doctors said cold weather had caused more lung infections and regular
flu cases, but that treatment procedures required them to report and
test all ["flu"] patients for avian influenza virus [infection]. The
H5N1 virus -- which has killed 73 people in Asia, including 42
Vietnamese -- persists [in poultry] in 8 of the country's 64
provinces, the Animal Health Department said in a report. Department
director Bui Quang Anh said the spread of the disease had slowed in
recent weeks, but there were more cases to come. "If we are not
taking comprehensive measures, the risk of more bird flu outbreaks
will be very high, especially when it is nearing Tet festival," Anh
told the police-run An Ninh Thu Do newspaper, referring to the Lunar
New Year festival. Chicken is traditionally offered to ancestors at
Tet, which falls in late January this year [2006].

[A previous report from Viet Nam (see: Avian influenza, human - East
Asia (200): China, Indonesia, Viet Nam 20051216.3618) concerning a
suspected case of avian influenza in a 3-year-old child also was not
confirmed, and the child's illness was ascribed similarly to the
onset of colder weather and the prevalence of human influenza virus
infections. The most recent human case of avian influenza virus
infection in Viet Nam was confirmed by WHO on 25 Nov 2005. The
patient was a 15-year-old youth who recovered. - Mod.CP]

Suspected Human Case of Avian influenza in Israel Not confirmed
-----------------------------------------------
Further to the ProMED-mail posting of 25 Nov 2005 archived as "Avian
influenza, human - Eurasia (01): Israel, susp. 20051125.3416," final
laboratory results were received on 21 Dec 2005 from 2 international
reference laboratories. The WHO Influenza Centre at the National
Institute of Medical Research (Mill Hill, London) tested pharyngeal
swabs by PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) and
sera by HI (hemagglutination inhibition) HI, and the Central Public
Health Laboratory (Colindale, London) tested sera by SNT (serum
neutralization test).
Both laboratories confirmed the negative results obtained in Israel.
We are grateful to Prof. Ella Mendelson, Director, Israel's Central
Virology Laboratory (Ministry of Health, Public Health Services,
Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer), for kindly updating us.
