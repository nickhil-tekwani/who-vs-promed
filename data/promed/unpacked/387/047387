From: Gerald L. McLaughlin, Ph.D <gmclaugh@iupui.edu>

Additional support for [the role of _E. coli_ as a co-factor in colorectal
cancer, would include the invasion only of certain clones or strains or
subtypes of _E. coli_ into these lesions. Fingerprinting a series of
"intestinal" versus "tissue-invading" _E. coli_ would answer this question.
My prediction is that as for papillomavirus and cancer, only certain
subtypes will be correlated with highest carcinogenesis. Adhesion may be a
prerequisite, but the many other genes involved with invasion and
establishment, would suggest that the ability to invade susceptible colon
tissue will be possessed only by a small subset of _E. coli_. Skepticism
is of course necessary and correlations aren't causes, but despite our
inability to test Koch's postulates on
humans, experimentation can steadily build or destroy a case for roles for
infectious disease agents in chronic diseases and cancers.
