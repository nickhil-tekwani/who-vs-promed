S.Korea Finds More Disease in Pigs
-----------------------------------
SEOUL: The government said it would slaughter 40 000 pigs in central South
Korea after 20 pigs tested positive Sun 12 May in initial checks for the
foot-and-mouth livestock disease.

Hoping to halt the disease's spread, authorities will slaughter all pigs at
farms within 1.8 miles from where initial cases were found, said Choi
Myung-chul at the Agriculture and Forestry Ministry.

The first outbreaks early this month killed hundreds of pigs at a farm in
Jinchon district and another in Ansung district, 60 miles south of Seoul.
Four more cases were confirmed Sat 11 May at two farms in Ansung and two
others in nearby Yongin district -- all within 1.6 miles from where the
initial cases were found.

On Sunday, 17 pigs at a farm in Yongin and three other pigs at a farm in
Jinchon district tested positive in preliminary checks of the disease, Choi
said.

The government has so far slaughtered some 35 000 livestock, mostly pigs,
in an effort to contain the disease. The disease, so far limited to pigs,
seems to be spreading only within that region. So we decided to slaughter
all the pigs in the area, hoping to rid the disease completely, Choi said.
The ministry will take similar measures against other livestock if they are
found to be infected, he said.

Soldiers and health officials are decontaminating farms, as well as
vehicles entering and exiting the affected areas. Two-thirds of South
Korea's 106 livestock markets have closed to prevent the spread of the disease.

The outbreak came ahead of the soccer World Cup to be co-hosted by South
Korea and Japan on May 31-June 30 2002. The Japanese government has raised
concerns about the possible spread of the disease when tourists visit the
two countries during the tournament. South Korea has called the concerns
groundless as the contaminated area is
far from World Cup venues.

Japan has banned the import of South Korean pigs and other livestock and
now requires visitors who spent time near contaminated farms to disinfect
their shoes at ports of entry.

Foot-and-mouth spreads in S Korea
-------------------------------------
Fears that the latest foot-and-mouth outbreak in South Korea could escalate
into a crisis grew on Saturday as further cases of the disease were
reported at four farms in the north of the country.

Six pigs were detected with the livestock virus at two farms in Anseong
county - the site of the first officially confirmed outbreak on 3 May
2002 and two in the adjoining Yongin county about 100 kilometers (60
miles) south of the capital, Seoul.

The South Korean Government, which has already implemented the slaughter of
nearly 12 000 pigs, ordered that of a further 7300 pigs on the four farms,
and vowed to slay all 300 000 hoofed animals in the area should there be
further outbreaks.

However, the government pointed out that all of the cases confirmed on
Saturday were located within 2 km of the site of the first outbreak and
were likely to have contracted the disease before it was first reported
last week.

To prevent the spread of the disease, all farms with a 100-km radius of the
outbreak have been closed and two-thirds of the country's 106 livestock
markets have also been shut down.

Several checkpoints are in place in the quarantine area and animals within
a smaller radius are likely to be vaccinated, reports said.

The outbreak comes just three weeks before the 31 May 2002 kick-off of the
football World Cup, hosted by Korea and Japan. Suwon, the site of the
nearest World Cup stadium, is 40 km to the north.

[In view of the initial spread of the outbreak -- so far, as it seems,
within a limited area -- and the need for its urgent control or
eradication, the S.Korean authorities seem to have taken a decision to
combine stamping-out policy with limited (ring) vaccinations. The actual
timing of the initial introduction of the virus may be the decisive factor
for the further developments and the ability to refrain from mass
vaccinations. Experience of FMD vaccinations in Asia was one of the issues
discussed during the International Conference on Prevention and Control
of Foot and Mouth Disease, Brussels, 12 - 13 Dec 2001
<http://www.cmlag.fgov.be/eng/conference.html>.

The status of the Republic of Korea's as FMD free country without
vaccination has been suspended by the OIE due to the recent appearance of
the disease. However, the Delegate of the Republic of Korea has requested
that the foot and mouth disease free status of Cheja island, approved
during the 69th OIE General Session, be reinstated. The OIE Director
General has asked for clarifications on this request and a decision will be
made shortly. (See OIEs FMD pages, updated 06 May 2002 --
