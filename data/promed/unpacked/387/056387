A man from Tando Allahyar is battling for life at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) after he was diagnosed with rabies encephalitis, a disease caused by bites of rabid dogs and other animals from which there is no chance of survival if the affected person was not vaccinated on time.

Health officials said [the patient], a 35-year-old man from Tando Allahyar town of Sindh, was brought to JPMC with suspected rabies encephalitis, which was later confirmed.

"The patient has been admitted to the medical intensive care unit, but he is unlikely to survive due to 100 per cent mortality in the case of rabies encephalitis," said Dr Seemin Jamali, the JPMC executive director, as she spoke to The News on Sunday [22 Dec 2019].

As many as 23 people have so far died in Sindh this year [2019] due to rabies.

Dr Seemin, who runs the country's largest dog-bite treatment and vaccination centre in the country at the JPMC, said the patient was brought to the health facility with hydrophobia and delirium and a history of dog-bite. She added that the patient was probably not vaccinated against rabies after he was bitten by a dog.

Officials say that over 250 000 people, mostly women and children, have been bitten by stray dogs in Sindh, including in Karachi, this year [2019].

As the Pakistan People's Party-led provincial government has barred the municipal authorities from culling stray dogs, no other effective measures are being taken against the animals due to which the incidents of dog-bite are being frequently reported.

[Rabies, in areas where dog-rabies is endemic, is presented in the country's annual reports to the OIE as one of country's prominent zoonoses in humans; however, no quantitative information is included. Pakistan is classified among the 3 countries with the highest human rabies incidence in South Asia (the others are India and Bangladesh).

We have recently received several reports from Pakistan describing human rabies cases; e.g. https://www.samaa.tv/news/2019/11/rabies-death-toll-reaches-21-in-sindh/ (published 7 Nov 2019), https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/549907-father-of-six-bitten-by-stray-dog-awaiting-painful-death-at-jpmc (published 3 Nov 2019), and https://www.geo.tv/latest/251263-dog-that-bit-25-people-in-karachi-overnight-found-dead (published 15 Oct 2019).

According to Pakistan's Health Minister, Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, (on Fri 8 Nov 2019), dog-bite cases were "mishandled" by citizens, as the victims were often brought to hospitals quite late, and the delay caused their deaths.

A recent study (Ref. 1) highlighted the urgent need to enhance public awareness of rabies.
