Ebola haemorrhagic fever, Democratic Republic of the Congo
----------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Democratic Republic of the Congo
[Congo DR] declared on 25 Dec 2008 an outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic
fever in Mweka District, Kasai Occidental province based on
laboratory results from the Centre International de Recherches
Medicales de Franceville (CIRMF) in Gabon. CIRMF confirmed the
presence of Ebola virus in 2 samples from 2 of the patients in the
outbreak by antigen detection. In addition, laboratory tests
conducted by the Institut National de Recherches Biologiques (INRB)
in Kinshasa, also confirmed the presence of _Shigella_.

As of Fri 26 Dec 2008, WHO is aware of 34 suspected cases including 9
deaths (CFR [case fatality rate] 26 percent) associated with the
ongoing event. Additional samples have been collected and are en
route to INRB.

The WHO Country Office, Regional Office, and Headquarters are
supporting the MoH in Kinshasa and in the field at the location of
the outbreak. In addition, the WHO Country Office is supporting the
operational costs of the investigation and response teams and has
deployed 4 vehicles to the field. Additional staff, outbreak response
equipment, and supplies, including personal protective equipment
(PPE), are also being sent to the area. An enhanced team of national
and international experts is being mobilized to implement control
strategies for Ebola haemorrhagic fever and to support outbreak field
response in the province.

WHO is working together with laboratory partners to provide
comprehensive laboratory services, and to support the MoH in the
control and investigation of the outbreak. WHO is unaware of any
reports signaling the international spread of disease and advises
against the application of any travel or trade restrictions upon the
Democratic Republic of the Congo

The location of Mweka District can be found at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mweka,_Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo>.

Mweka is a town in southern-central Democratic Republic of the Congo,
situated on the Kasai railway line between Kananga (250 km/155 mi
away) and the Kasai River port of Ilebo (172 km/107 mi away). Mweka
is the headquarters of the Territoire de Mweka (administrative
district) of Kasai-Occidental province. According to the Wikipedia
website, although "remote" is the default international media
description for any Congo DR town outside Kinshasa, Mweka is
relatively accessible by the standards of the country. Mweka Airport
is 372 nm (690 km/428 mi) east of Kinshasa.

Beginning in late August 2007, the Territoire de Mweka was the site
of an outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic fever, which had killed more than
100 people by 30 Aug 2007, including all those who attended the
funerals of 2 village chiefs (see
<http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/mourners-die-as-fever-grips-congo/2007/08/30/1188067243698.html>).

The number fatalities and the number of suspected cases in the
current outbreak have not increased since the previous report form
the region. A new observation of unknown significance is the presence
of _Shigella_ in samples sent to the INRB Kinshasa for investigation.
Further information and clarification is awaited. - Mod.CP]
