Health Ministry: yellow fever claims 63 lives
---------------------------------------------
Sudan's Federal Health Ministry announced that the number of yellow fever cases in Darfur has increased to more than 143, including 63 deaths, Radio Dabanga has learned on Sunday 4 Nov 2011.

The Ministry confirmed the emergence of new cases among the population in the southern regions west of El-Geneina [sic; must mean east -- see map in Comment] in West Darfur and the adjacent areas in Central Darfur. [El-Geneina is practically on the border with Chad, and surveillance should be carried out for yellow fever in that part of Chad. - Mod.JW].

At the same time, the State Health Ministry of South Darfur disclosed their urgent need for approximately 9 million doses of [yellow fever] vaccine for the people of Darfur in the battle against the 'epidemic disease', adding it could take more than 2 weeks for the vaccines to arrive.

For his part, the Minister of Health of the Darfur Regional Authority, Osman al-Bushra, confirmed the increase of yellow fever cases and its spread from Central Darfur to the east and west, adding that a medical team of doctors and specialists is scheduled to arrive in the affected areas on Sunday [11? Nov 2012].

[To quote Mod.MPP's comment in the previous report:

"The southern part of Sudan and South Sudan are in the yellow fever (YF) belt of Africa (see <1http://www.cdc.gov/yellowfever/maps/africa.html>. Given the security constraints in the region, it is not surprising that the identification of yellow fever virus as the etiology of these outbreaks took approximately one month to establish. The remoteness of the involved areas combined with the security challenges and the fact that many of the cases are learned of postmortem (and post burial) means adequate specimens for laboratory testing are difficult to obtain.

The only treatment for yellow fever at present is supportive care, but the disease is a vaccine preventable disease. Hopefully, the security constraints will not impede the needed vaccination campaign to control the outbreak.

[Yellow fever (YF) is very rare in Sudan -- the last outbreak was in Southern Kordofan state in 2005 (a couple of hundred miles by air east of Central Darfur), which caused 163 deaths out of 604 cases over about 5 months (see ProMED archive below), and the one before that was in the Nuba Mountains (see map below), in that same state in 1940, 65 years earlier.

Radio Netherlands Worldwide reports today [6 Nov 2011]
http://www.rnw.nl/africa/bulletin/darfur-yellow-fever-deaths-double-67-un-agency
"As of 5 November 2012, 194 suspected cases have been reported, including 67 deaths," a joint report from the health ministry and the World Health Organisation said. Since the last week of September [2012], cases have been reported from 17 districts in 4 of the Darfur states, but most of them are from Central Darfur state, the report said.

A week ago the health ministry said 84 suspected cases had been reported from 2 states during October and 32 of the patients had died. Officials are awaiting results from a laboratory in Senegal [probably the Pasteur Institute in Dakar. - Mod.JW] to reconfirm the diagnosis as a first step towards beginning a vaccination programme possibly by early December.

There is no specific treatment for the viral illness found in tropical regions of Africa but it can be contained through the use of bed nets, insect repellents and long clothing. "Vaccination is the single most important measure for preventing yellow fever," the WHO said.

It is debatable whether it would be faster to get YF vaccine from the stock in Geneva, Switzerland or from the WHO Regional Office for Africa in Brazzaville, Congo Republic -- although Sudan does not belong to the African Region of WHO, but to the Eastern Mediterranean Region which is unlikely to be carrying a stock of YF vaccine. In any case, speed is essential, because the vaccine is only effective 10 days after it is given, and then only provided it has been kept refrigerated for the whole time from production to application. The poor security situation in the area will certainly complicate matters. - Mod.JW
