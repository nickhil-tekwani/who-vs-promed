From contact with the WHO European Regional office, we understand the
situation regarding reported anthrax in Albania to be the following:
One case of anthrax in a man who skins cows.
Our source is: Dr. Silva Bino, Director, Institute of Public Health, Rruga
Alexander Moisiu No. 80, Tirana, Albania
We are not sure of the reason for the reported high numbers of cases, but
we are investigating. There is a possibility that the high number of cases
reported is referring to summary data for 2001 that was just released.
We will keep you posted on further developments, if any.

No infection of anthrax in Albania - suspicion for one person in Macedonia
----------------------------------
Day before yesterday some Albanian agencies informed that there is anthrax
infection in Albania and that 120 infected persons have already been
discovered. The Macedonian Institute for Healthcare Protection yesterday
stated that after the official contacts with the authorities in Albania it
is established that there is only one person infected by this disease in
Albania and that it is case of skin anthrax.
The Institute stated that at the moment one case is examined in Macedonia,
for which there is suspicion that it could be skin anthrax, reports A1 TV.
This person is hospitalized in the Medical Center in Veles and analysis is
ongoing at the moment. Skin anthrax is common in these regions at this time
of the year.
Individual cases of skin anthrax in Macedonia were also registered during
the last years, stated authorities in the Institute. According to them
Macedonia is ready to undertake all necessary precautionary measures if the
disease starts spreading.
