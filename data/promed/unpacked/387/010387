"Around 700 animals are dead, and there will be more, because of the bluetongue disease. Around 2000-3000 animals are infected," said Associate Professor Boyko Likov, Director of the Risk Assessment Centre with the Bulgarian Food Safety Agency, speaking for Nova TV.

In his words, the spread of the disease is very high at the moment. "In other words, usually in the other countries, such spreading covers 15-30 km a week. Things in Bulgaria develop much faster; the disease has covered around 180 km just in around 3 weeks," the expert commented further.

Bulgaria has requested Brussels permits to vaccinate all ruminants against bluetongue disease, as the vaccine is strictly prohibited in the EU. Interim Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Food Georgi Kostov, who also chairs the established crisis staff over the disease, announced the news, the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) reported.

The vaccinations will cost some BGN 7.5 million [USD 5.08 million], which the state will provide. According to the official, the effect the vaccinations will have will be felt next year.

The European Union's capital is about to address the "blue tongue" disease, which is spreading in Bulgaria at a rapid pace. There will be an extraordinary meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.

Three outbreaks were registered in Bulgaria's Pirin region, and 81 sheep have died from the disease.

In sheep, BTV causes an acute disease with high morbidity and mortality. BTV also infects goats, cattle and other domestic animals as well as wild ruminants.

[After an apparent absence since 2000, BTV-4 returned to continental Greece at the end of May 2014, initially affecting the Peloponnesos then spreading to northern regions. So far, 271 outbreaks have been reported. BTV-4 was reported later in Greece's neighbours Bulgaria (starting on 4 Jul 2014, so far 154 outbreaks), Former Yug. Rep. of Macedonia (starting 30 Jul 2014, so far 22 outbreaks) and Turkey (Thrace, on the Bulgarian border, starting 11 Aug 2014, one outbreak).

The events in Greece and Bulgaria are of concerning dimensions, causing serious losses in the susceptible sheep. In the absence of vaccination, these losses are expected to increase, and the disease may spread further in south-east Europe before the end of the 2014 culicoides activity season, expected when temperatures decrease.

On 19 Aug 2014, Turkey reported in its follow-up report that 30 000 sheep have been vaccinated in the Kirklareli province. It will be interesting to note which vaccine has been applied, inactivated or live attenuated. A decision about vaccination in Bulgaria (and Greece?!) is expected during the SCFCAH due meeting in Brussels.

Bluetongue disease is caused by an orbivirus of which 26 distinct serotypes have been identified throughout the years. It is transmitted by culicoides spp, causing viraemia in ruminants, while clinical disease is mostly seen in sheep. Certain serotypes (e.g. BTV-8) have caused clinical disease in cattle as well. It is not zoonotic.

A list including Bluetongue virus type 4 (BTV-4) isolates in the dsRNA virus collection at IAH Pirbright (1969-2014), including 14 isolates collected in Bulgaria during 2014 from sheep and goats, is available at http://www.reoviridae.org/dsRNA_virus_proteins/ReoID/btv-4.htm#BUL2014/14.

A different serotype, BTV-1, has been circulating in Italy since September 2013. Recently, this virus has renewed its spread along Italy's western coastal regions. So far, 107 outbreaks have been reported.

An interactive OIE map demonstrating the rapid and wide spread of BTV in the mentioned 5 countries since 1 Jul 2014 is available at http://tinyurl.com/pm5mdlu (click on the cluster, zoom in). - Mod.AS
