North Korea is struggling to contain foot-and-mouth disease [FMD], which was earlier reported in pigs and has now spread to cattle, officials from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said on Wednesday [26 Mar 2014] after returning from a visit to North Korean farms and markets to assess the outbreaks.

North Korean officials originally reported to the FAO and the World Organisation for Animal Health [OIE] on 18 Feb 2014 that FMD had affected 3280 pigs in an area near the capital Pyongyang and killed 369, FAO health officer Carolyn Benigno said on Wednesday [26 Mar 2014] after a week-long visit to North Korea.

FAO officials found that the disease was still spreading among pigs and was also affecting cattle on at least 2 farms in a remote mountainous region in southern Kangwon province near the border with South Korea, she said.

"FMD was 1st reported on 8 Jan 2014, on a pig farm near Pyongyang, and continued to spread in pigs despite containment measures taken by veterinary services," Benigno told reporters at a briefing in Bangkok. "The 1st report to us is that FMD was in pigs, but when we were there, we received reports that some cattle were infected."

The FAO officials visited the Pyongyang market, pig farms near Pyongyang and one cooperative cattle farm, where they saw 4 sick cows with lesions.

"The team was able to confirm that the FMD outbreak in DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) is still ongoing at the time of our visit," Benigno said.

The FAO officials visited the DPRK after its chief veterinary officer requested emergency assistance to improve his staff's ability to diagnose and control the disease, she said.

The FAO advised North Korea on basic control measures, including disinfecting farms and limiting people's movement to prevent spread of the disease to other farms, and is now preparing to provide training on farm biosecurity, field and laboratory equipment and training in animal handling and collection of samples.

[According to North Korea's last available periodic report to the OIE, covering the period January to June 2013, vaccination is included among the applied FMD control measures (see at http://tinyurl.com/q3fbtkk). Information on the vaccine strain(s) applied will be helpful. In any event, the continuous circulation of the virus, affecting both swine and cattle, is a cause for concern -- underlining the urgent need for early submission of samples to an international FMD reference laboratory, for confirmation of the serotyping and for genotyping. - Mod.AS
