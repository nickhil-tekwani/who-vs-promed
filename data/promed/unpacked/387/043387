Health officials have recommended puppies be banned from aged care facilities after 2 outbreaks of potentially deadly _Campylobacter_ gastroenteritis in a Canberra nursing home. But trained adult dogs will still be able to visit aged care homes.

According to a paper to be presented at a Communicable Diseases Conference in Canberra on Tue 19 Mar 2013, 15 people were infected during 2 separate gastroenteritis outbreaks in the nursing home between April and June 2012.

A healthy 4-month-old puppy was identified as the likely cause of the outbreaks and excluded from the facility.

An expert panel was established to investigate the case. "_Campylobacter jejuni_ was recovered from both human and canine faecal samples," the study findings said.

"A review of published literature showed puppies extensively shed _Campylobacter_ species. The [aged care] setting and low infective dose also made transmission likely, despite the varying degrees of contact between the puppy and cases. While infection control practices were generally appropriate, the facility's animal policy did not adequately address potential zoonotic risk."

Elderly people infected with _Campylobacter_ have an increased risk of hospitalisation and death. The panel recommended the puppy be excluded from the aged care home until it was at least a year old and assessed as being suited for an aged care environment.

The panel decided puppies should not be considered as aged care companions due to "high rates of _Campylobacter_ carriage and shedding; their social immaturity; susceptibility of elderly residents to infection; and poor outcomes".

In 2012, health authorities were officially notified of 477 campylobacteriosis cases in the ACT [Australian Capital Territory] and 15 645 cases nationally.

[Campylobacteriosis is a classical zoonosis which can be transmitted directly or indirectly to man from poultry, beef and dairy cattle, pigs, and domestic pets including dogs and cats, especially puppies (as in this cluster) and kittens.

It should be noted that Sahin et al (Sahin O, Fitzgerald C, Stroika S, et al: Molecular evidence for zoonotic transmission of an emergent, highly pathogenic _Campylobacter jejuni_ clone in the United States. J Clin Microbiol. 2012 Mar; 50(3): 680-7; available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3295108/) report on an emerging clone of the organism transmitted from a ruminant reservoir. The abstract is below:

_Campylobacter jejuni_ is a major zoonotic pathogen. A highly virulent, tetracycline-resistant _C. jejuni_ clone (clone SA) has recently emerged in ruminant reservoirs and has become the predominant cause of sheep abortion in the USA. To determine whether clone SA is associated with human disease, we compared the clinical isolates of clone SA from sheep abortions with the human isolates of the PulseNet National Campylobacter databases at the CDC and the FDA using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and serotyping. The combined SmaI and KpnI PFGE pattern designations of clone SA from sheep were indistinguishable from those of 123 (9.03 percent) human _C. jejuni_ isolates (total, 1361) in the CDC database, among which 56 were associated with sporadic infections and 67 were associated with outbreaks that occurred in multiple states from 2003 to 2010. Most of the outbreaks were attributed to raw milk, while the sources for most of the sporadic cases were unknown. All clone SA isolates examined, including PFGE-matched human isolates, belong to sequence type 8 (ST-8) by MLST and serotype HS:1,8, further indicating the clonality of the related isolates from different host species. Additionally, _C. jejuni_ clone SA was identified in raw milk, cattle feces, the feces and bile of healthy sheep, and abortion cases of cattle and goats, indicating the broad distribution of this pathogenic clone in ruminants. These results provide strong molecular and epidemiological evidence for zoonotic transmission of this emergent clone from ruminants to humans and indicate that _C. jejuni_ clone SA is an important threat to public health. - Mod.LL
