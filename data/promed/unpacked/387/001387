Alico, one of the South's best-known agribusiness companies operating in
Central and Southwest Florida, and with about 136 500 acres in real estate
holdings, was informed on 31 Aug 2005, by the Florida Department of
Agriculture and Consumer Services that citrus canker [CC] was confirmed in
Alico's Knowles-Thomas grove located in Hendry County, FL.
CC is a highly contagious bacterial disease of citrus that causes premature
leaf and fruit drop. CC does not harm humans, animals, or plant life other
than citrus. In order to eradicate CC, infected and exposed trees within
1900 feet of the canker find, must be removed and destroyed in accordance
with Florida law.
John R Alexander, chairman and CEO of Alico, Inc. said, "This is the 2nd
instance of CC in our groves this year. We recently hired 2 canker
inspectors so that we can discover the disease early if present, thereby
minimizing losses. This finding was discovered by our in-house inspectors
and is expected to impact approximately 350 acres of this grove location.
The earlier finding this year affected approximately 150 acres of a grove
in Polk County, Florida." This finding, coupled with the earlier one,
affects about 4.5 per cent of the Company's 11 147 citrus-producing acres.
All of the trees in this grove are covered under the Federal Crop Insurance
program. A net loss of about USD 960 000, consisting of tree development
costs and inventoried costs, will be recorded in the 4th quarter of fiscal
2005. Reimbursements to be received from this insurance coverage are
expected to cover about 62 per cent of the loss.
In addition, under the Florida Canker Eradication Program, citrus may not
be replanted on the property until it has been determined that the property
has been canker-free for 2 years. In light of this, the Company is
evaluating the property for its best future use. The Knowles-Thomas grove
is not contiguous to other Company groves.

[CC continues to be reported in Florida. Because of Hurricane Katrina and
previous storms, Florida citrus growers will continue to see additional
findings of CC. The causal bacterium _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pv. _citri_
will continue to exacerbate the situation for Florida citrus growers.
