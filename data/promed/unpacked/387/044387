RABIES, HUMAN, IMPORTED (03)
============================
Date: Sat, 5 Apr 1997 08:32:55 +0700 (BKK)
From: Henry Wilde <fmedhwl@chulkn.car.chula.ac.th>
Thailand has been able to reduce the incidence of human rabies from close to
400 cases per year to less than 70 in 1996. India, on the other hand, has
recently revised the incidence of human rabies from 20,000 cases per year to
30,000 (Dr. Segal, Rabies Conference at Paris - Pasteur - March 1997). The
probable reason for the reduction in human rabies cases in Thailand during
the past 10 years was the abolition of the use of dangerous Semple and
Sucklin Mouse Brain Vaccines in 1985/6 and the wide availability of second
generation tissue culture vaccines (Vero cell, Chick and Duck cell) which
are affordable and can be used with the Thei red Cross and Oxford
intradermal schedules that reduce cost even further. Massive public
education efforts by the Thai Red Cross, universities and the MPH have also
helped much.
Rabies is still just as prevalent among dogs in Thailand (and neighboring
coutries) as it was before! The reduction is thus mostly by costly
postexposure treatment and not by control of the disease in the canine
population as recommended by WHO.
We recently conducted a survey of 499 district and provincial government
hospitals in the Kingdom and still found that most had problems with
postexposure rabies management. These problems mentioned were mainly lack of
human or equine rabies immune globulins. About half of the hospitals had
none available, mostly due to economic constraints and the worldwide
shortege in supply. This alone is a powerful argument for preexposure
vaccination of visitors and long term residents to this region and other
parts of Asia where canine rabies is endemic.
