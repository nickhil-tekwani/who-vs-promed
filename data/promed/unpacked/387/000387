Warning about dangers of Botox injections
-----------------------------------------
RIO DE JANEIRO: The rapid rise in popularity of Botox (botulinum toxin)
injections for treating facial wrinkles has resulted in its misuse by
practitioners other than dermatologists or plastic surgeons, dermatologists
warned here.
Using the toxin inappropriately can result in severe facial paralysis and
deformity, according to Dr. Edileia Bagatin from the Federal University of
Sao Paulo, speaking at the World Congress in Cosmetic Dermatology.
The use of the toxin in cosmetic salons, particularly in Brazil, by
non-medical professionals is increasing, Bagatin noted. In addition to the
risks to the patient in wrongly injecting the toxin, the poor results have
a detrimental effect on public opinion of the technique.
In an interview with Reuters Health, Bagatin explained that the toxin,
which is injected into very precise locations on the face to produce
relaxation of specific muscle groups that result in disappearance of the
wrinkle, requires a profound understanding of the anatomy of the face.
"Many people are trying the toxin out on different areas, but it should
really only be used on the forehead to remove brow furrows and around the
eyes to remove crows-feet," she said. "The lack of regulation concerns us.
The drug companies that produce the toxin should be ensuring that only the
people that are properly qualified can use it."
Botox is an extremely potent muscle relaxant that is lethal in doses of
2000 units or more. According to Bagatin, it has only a temporary but
dramatic effect in removing wrinkles and so it should only be used in
combination with other facial rejuvenation techniques.
