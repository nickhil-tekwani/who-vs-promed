[The New Jersey serotype identified here was also found in Mexico in
mid October of this year [2011]. Vesicular stomatitis (VS) has been
found in Belize previously in both cattle and horses. It is always
reassuring to the epidemiologists when horses are involved because
then we can be sure the outbreak is not Foot & Mouth Disease, The 2
diseases are clinically indistinguishable in cattle and pigs but
horses are not
susceptible to FMD.
