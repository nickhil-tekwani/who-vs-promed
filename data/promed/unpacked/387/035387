The following has been extracted from the OIE Technical factsheet "Questions and Answers on Avian Influenza" (last updated 1 Mar 2021); subscribers are encouraged to visit the full text at https://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/update-on-avian-influenza/questions-and-answers-on-avian-influenza/.

"What is the current situation of avian influenza?
"Updated information on the current situation of AI is available here (https://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/update-on-avian-influenza/2016/), based on the data reported by countries through the OIE World Animal Health Information System (OIE-WAHIS).

"Since August 2020, there has been a substantial increase in the number of AI outbreaks caused by various subtypes, notably the H5N8, reported by many countries in Europe, Asia and recently in Africa, which reflect a period of heightened risks. This 2020/21 epizootic is marked by the significant involvement and mortality of wild birds. As the risk of virus introductions via migratory wild birds remains high, countries should stay vigilant, and implement effective surveillance and monitoring measures for early detection and response.

"What are the causes of the current wave of avian influenza cases and is it worse than in previous years?
"Molecular characterization of the currently circulating AI virus subtypes shows genetic variability from previous years. This might be explained by multiple reassortments with low pathogenic viruses circulating in wild birds. The evolution of the viruses and these recent events need to be closely monitored and further studied in order to assess the risks.

"It is most likely that migratory wild birds, followed by local farming practices, have contributed to the dissemination and introduction of the virus into new countries and farms. A similar situation of H5N8 epizootics in many countries associated with wild bird migration occurred in 2016/17.

"The H5N8 virus has also reassorted with other wild bird influenza viruses to form new subtypes, which were also reported by countries.

"What factors can facilitate the spread of avian influenza?
"The dynamic of the spread of influenza viruses is extremely complex and difficult to predict. Several factors can influence it, such as the wild bird migration pattern, unregulated trade, farming systems, biosecurity and immunity status.

"During the Northern Hemisphere winter, the wild bird movements may increase, and lower temperatures may facilitate the environmental survival of AI viruses, increasing exposure of infection in poultry. Additionally, the mixing of wild birds from different geographic origins during migration can increase the risk of virus spread and genetic reassortment resulting in changes in viral properties.

"At [a] local level, as the AI viruses can survive for long periods in the environment, they can be easily transmitted from farm to farm by the movement of infected animals, as well as contaminated boots, vehicles and equipment if the adequate biosecurity measures are not implemented.

"What is the risk of avian influenza for human health?
"The epidemiology of AI viruses is complex: They can change and evolve by mutation and reassortment, with the emergence of new subtypes causing significant impacts on animal health and production. Some subtypes -- not all -- can be zoonotic and therefore pose a threat to human health.

"Transmission of AI viruses to humans occurs when there is close contact with infected birds or heavily contaminated environments.

"In February 2021, human cases of AI subtype H5N8 were reported by Russian authorities to the World Health Organization (WHO). The OIE/FAO network of experts on animal influenza (OFFLU) analyzed the preliminary information of the event and stated that, to date, there is no evidence to suggest that severe human infections or human-to-human transmission of this virus have occurred. This situation likely represents an isolated spillover event of the virus, as genetic evidence suggests that these viruses were derived from chickens with no adaptation to humans.

"More information is available on the OFFLU statement (February 2021) at http://www.offlu.net/fileadmin/home/en/publications/pdf/OFFLU_Russia_H5N8_final.pdf." - Mod.CRD]
