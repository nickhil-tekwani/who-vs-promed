[Sporadic cases continue to be reported. Since the beginning of November 2016 there have been 10 newly confirmed cases reported from Saudi Arabia. All 10 were classified as primary cases, 4 of whom had a history of direct contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of their illness, whereas 6 of them were still under investigation as to possible high risk exposures in the 14 days preceding onset of illness.

During the month of October 2016, there were 14 newly confirmed cases, one of whom was classified as a secondary household contact, 4 were secondary healthcare acquired (2 in patients, 2 in healthcare workers), and the remaining 9 were classified as primary cases, with 3 having a history of direct contact with camels and 6 listed as still under investigation as to possible high risk exposures in the 14 days preceding onset of illness.

The pattern seems to be one of the majority of cases classified as primary cases initially classified as being under investigation for possible high risk exposures. According to the most recent information on the Saudi MOH MERS-CoV statistics website (see source URL above), 45 percent of cases reported since January 2015 were classified as primary cases whereas 51 percent were classified as secondary cases (39 percent of total cases were healthcare acquired). The classifications provided on the MOH website are preliminary classifications at the time of initial confirmation of MERS-CoV infection. It would be interesting to know the results of the investigations into possible high risk exposures of the cases classified as primary but high risk exposures were under investigation.

A key question is, what is/are the high risk exposure(s) for those individuals classified as primary cases that do not have a history of contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness?

A map showing the locations of the newly confirmed cases can be found at the source URL above.
