Schmallenberg virus detected all over Denmark
---------------------------------------------
National Veterinary Institute studies of cattle and midges show that the Schmallenberg virus [SBV] is widespread throughout Denmark. It may mean more deformed calves in the spring.

In August and September [2012] the National Veterinary Institute, in agreement with the Food and Drug Administration, trapped small mosquitoes called midges in 4 locations throughout Denmark. SBV was identified in midges from all 4 sites and throughout the said period.

Such results may have consequences for the due spring: if the infected midges bite the female animals during pregnancy, their offspring may become malformed.

"Our analysis suggests that a large part of midges in Denmark are infected, and since many cows are pregnant now, the current spread of SBV will result in malformed calves in the spring," says Lasse Dam Rasmussen, senior researcher at the Section of Virology at the National Veterinary Institute.

The risk of malformed lambs and kids is lower, since sheep and goats in Denmark are mostly not pregnant at this time of the year. Midges are tested for viral RNA by PCR technique.

Infected cattle
---------------
In addition to the findings in midges, the National Veterinary Institute has detected, since May [2012], antibodies against SBV virus in one cattle herd in Zealand, 2 in Midtfyn, and 18 cattle herds in Jutland in the area between Skjern and the German border. A total of 54 animals tested positive for antibodies to SBV, of which 46 detected within the past month.

The cattle have been tested serologically for exports or because of disease symptoms in the herd. The antibodies show that the animals have been infected with the virus this year or last year.

[Some countries have imposed restrictive import requirements from SBV-affected countries. Such measures are in place particularly when involving live animals (cattle, sheep, goats) and their semen from infected countries. Restrictions on meat, milk, and dairy products are generally regarded excessive.

The European Food Safety Agency (ESFA) has issued the scientific report "Schmallenberg virus: Analysis of the Epidemiological Data and Assessment of Impact", available at http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/2768.htm.

The following documents may be of assistance to those interested in the current measures applied to minimise the risk of international SBV spread:

So far, SBV has been recorded from Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, France, Luxembourg, UK, Denmark, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, Austria and Poland. - Mod.AS
