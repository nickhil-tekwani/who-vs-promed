West Nile Virus-positive Birds Found in Indiana Now Total Five
--------------------------------------------------------------
Three more dead birds were found positive for West Nile virus RNA by the
Indiana State Department of Health Molecular Virology Laboratory. Two
birds, one crow and one blue jay were collected on 10 Sep 2001 in Floyd
County. One crow was collected on 4 Sep 2001 in Lake County. A total of 5
birds has now been confirmed as West Nile virus-positive since the virus
was first detected in Indiana on 21 Aug 2001. Positive crows had previously
been reported from Marion and Floyd Counties.
This indicates an extremely wide distribution of the virus from the
northernmost to the southernmost parts of the state, including one county
directly in the center.
To date, no human cases have been reported. West Nile virus is transmitted
by night-time biting mosquitoes, and Health Officials warn [Indiana
residents that night-time exposure to mosquitoes increases a person's risk
of being infected by the virus.
