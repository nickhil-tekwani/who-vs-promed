12 infected with anthrax in western Armenia
-------------------------------------------
YEREVAN: On 6 Aug 2001, 8 people were diagnosed with anthrax in the village
of Saratak in Shirak Region (western Armenia). The number of patients
reached 12 by 15 Aug 2001, Anushavan Agadzhanyan, head of the veterinary
inspectorate of the Armenian Agriculture Ministry, has told a Noyan Tapan
correspondent. It is not surprising to see that the number of patients has
increased because infected meat was sold to 48 families, Agadzhanyan added.
Among the infected people, only a 26-year-old resident of Saratak has
received treatment in hospital. Others did not need it. The head of the
inspectorate said that the source of the infection has been contained:
animals have been vaccinated, the police are on duty in villages to prevent
slaughter of animals and, in line with safety measures, slaughtering has
been banned for 14 days. Agadzhanyan said that the village, as a potential
source of anthrax, would be kept under strict control of the veterinary
inspectorate and other services.
Agadzhanyan said that no other case of anthrax has been registered.

[As I have said before, people contract anthrax when the veterinary
oversight is inadequate. It seems that Dr. Agadzhanyan has got the Saratak
situation under control. - Mod.MHJ
