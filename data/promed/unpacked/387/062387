[Information from FYR Macedonia's last OIE 6-monthly report (Jul-Dec 2016) indicates that, during 2016 the country reported 356 outbreaks of Lumpy skin disease (LSD). For further details on these outbreaks, see section 3 of this report. See report at http://tinyurl.com/l7uf8mo.

All outbreaks of LSD reported from 1 January 2015 to date [Wed 24 May 2017] can be seen on the interactive map at http://tinyurl.com/l7b5qst (click on the section of interest on the map, and zoom in). - Mod.CRD

According to information of the European Union Lumpy Skin Disease Vaccine Bank, 625 000 doses of live-homologous LSD vaccine have been granted to various south European countries during 2016, of which 50 000 to the FYR Macedonia (delivered in May 2016). The above and additional information on LSD in southern Europe, as of Jan 2017, is available at http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Presentation/2017/05/WC500228016.pdf.

According to another presentation, titled "In vivo evaluation of Lumpy Skin Disease vaccine efficacy in controlled environment", none of the tested LSD live-attenuated vaccines (including the live-homologous one currently in field use) protected against the initial post-vaccination fever spike.

A new, inactivated Vaccine, produced by MCI, Morocco, is under investigations. Reportedly, this refers to 2 vaccines - a sheep pox based and an LSDV-based vaccine. Both, reportedly, showed "promising results after one vaccination" while "booster vaccination was needed" (see, along with additional information on the vaccines testing, at
http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Presentation/2017/05/WC500228017.pdf.

It will be interesting to note any advances in these vaccines tasting since January 2017, and their mutual comparison.
