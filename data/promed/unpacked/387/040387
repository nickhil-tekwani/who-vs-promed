Tissue samples from a resident of the road to the coast are being analyzed by the Ministry of Public Health (MSP) with histopathological processes to find out if they are compatible with Peruvian wart disease, an infection caused by the bacterium _Bartonella bacilliformis_, which is transmitted by the bite of the vector sandfly of the genus _Lutzomyia_. Sandfly vectors are being trapped in the same area for entomological analysis, checking if they are the lutzomyia type and if they have the bacterium that causes the disease, also known as Oroya fever.

The epidemiologist-tropicalist doctor Eduardo Alfredo Gómez explained that this disease is not new [in Ecuador] because it has been registered years ago in patients in the towns of Zamora Chinchipe, Loja and Manabí. He indicated that the disease occurs in Peru and may be serious, since in the first phase red blood cells are destroyed, which may be fatal. Ecuador there have been no deaths from this disease since it has been detected and treated. "Now there is treatment, people do not die," he explained.

This disease has 2 phases: anemic and eruptive. The first is the most serious and can cause death in a few days if timely diagnosis and treatment are not performed. The eruptive phase arises after the anemic stage and generally occurs in children living in endemic areas, according to the Peruvian Ministry of Health.

Specialists in Guayaquil indicated that they are awaiting the results of the MSP, since this type of vector is not characteristic in cities on the coast. Gómez explained that the lutzomyia vector develops in an environment with 80% humidity and cannot live less than 300 metres above sea level. The epidemiologist Jhonny Real agrees on this issue. He expressed doubt that this type of vector, characteristic of mountainous and thick ecosystems of the Amazon, is on its way to the coast, but agreed that it is necessary for the MSP to detail the processes.

[It is not clear from this report exactly where this case of suspected bartonellosis was thought to be acquired.

Bartonellosis comprises infections caused by newly emerging pathogens. In 1909, Alberto Barton described organisms that adhered to red blood cells (RBCs). The name _Bartonia_, later _Bartonella bacilliformis_, was used for the only member of the group identified before 1993. _Rochalimaea_ (named for Rocha-Lima), a similar group, were recently combined with _Bartonella_. Although these organisms were originally thought to be rickettsiae, bartonella bacteria can be grown on artificial media, unlike rickettsiae.

At least a dozen species belong to the genus _Bartonella_. Three species are considered important causes of human disease, but other significant human pathogens in this genus will undoubtedly be found in the future. _B. bacilliformis_ causes Oroya fever and "verruga peruana" (Peruvian wart, also known as Carrion's disease). _B. henselae_ causes cat scratch disease (CSD). _B. quintana_ causes trench fever. Either _B. henselae_ or _B. quintana_ may cause peliosis of the liver (often called bacillary peliosis; characterized by cystic, blood-filled spaces in the liver), infections in homeless populations, and infections in patients with HIV and AIDS. New species that may cause human disease include _B. vinsonii_, _B. clarridgeiae_, and _B. elizabethae_. Several of these other species are found in animals.

_Bartonella bacilliformis_ is endemic in the Andean Mountain regions of Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia and usually substantially above sea level but seems to have expanded its range to lower altitudes between the highlands and jungles. The vector is the sandfly, _Lutzomyia verrucarum_ (see picture at http://tinyurl.com/hztcdk6).

The acute form of the disease caused by _B. bacilliformis_ gets its name from an outbreak that occurred in 1871 near La Oroya, Peru. More than 7000 people perished. Some survivors later developed a skin disease called verruga peruana (Peruvian wart). These skin lesions were observed prior to the 1871 outbreak -- perhaps as far back as the pre-Columbian era -- but a connection to Oroya fever was unknown. In 1885, a young medical researcher, Daniel Carrion, inoculated himself with blood from a lesion to study the course of the skin disease. When he became ill with Oroya fever, the connection became apparent. Oroya fever is often called Carrion's disease in honor of his fatal experiment.

Although the bacterium, _B. bacilliformis_, was isolated by Alberto Barton in 1909, it was not identified as the cause of the fever until 1940. The disease is limited to a small area of the Andes Mountains in western South America; nearly all cases have been in Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador. A large outbreak involving thousands of people occurred in 1940-41, but bartonellosis has since occurred sporadically. Control of sandflies, the only known disease vector, has been credited with managing the disease.

Once in the bloodstream, the bacteria attach to red blood cells (erythrocytes). For a picture of a blood smear with the organism associated with red blood cells, see https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0006497120629226-gr1.jpg. Bacilli can also enter the red blood cells. In the process, up to 90% of the host's erythrocytes are destroyed, causing severe hemolytic anemia. The anemia is accompanied by high fever, muscle and joint pain, delirium, and sometimes coma.

An infected individual may develop verruga peruana 2-8 weeks after the acute phase. However, individuals may exhibit the characteristic lesions without ever experiencing the acute phase or they can even precede the bacteremic phase. Left untreated, the lesions may last months or years. These lesions resemble blood-filled blisters, up to 4 cm (1.6 in) in diameter, and appear primarily on the head and limbs. They can be painful to the touch and may bleed or ulcerate; see http://tinyurl.com/z7ukf5k.

Bartonellosis is identified by symptoms and the patient's history, such as recent travel in areas where bartonellosis occurs. Isolation of _B. bacilliformis_ from the bloodstream or lesions can confirm the diagnosis. Antimicrobial agents are the mainstay of bartonellosis treatment. The bacteria are susceptible to several antibiotics, including chloramphenicol, penicillins, and aminoglycosides. Blood transfusions may be necessary to treat the anemia caused by bartonellosis.

Antibiotics have dramatically decreased the fatality associated with bartonellosis. Prior to the development of antibiotics, the fever was fatal in 40% of cases. With antibiotic treatment, that rate has dropped to 8%. Fatalities can result from complications associated with severe anemia and secondary infections. Once the infection is treated, an individual can recover fully. - Mod.LL
