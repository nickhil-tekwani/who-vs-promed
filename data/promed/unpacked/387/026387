- Reunion Island. 17 Apr 2018. The current dengue epidemic in La Réunion Island is intensifying in the west and the south. "Last week [week of 9 Apr 2018], 396 dengue cases were reported by city and hospital laboratories, for a total of 1388 confirmed cases in Réunion in 2018," said the Regional Health Agency (ARS) this [Tue 17 Apr 2018]. "Anti-vector actions are being reinforced in the affected areas and awareness-raising campaigns are increasing to involve the population in the fight against mosquitoes."

- Reunion Island. 28 Apr 2018. Health officials in France reported an additional 428 biologically confirmed and probable dengue fever cases in one week. This brings the total laboratory confirmed or probable cases to 1816 since the beginning of the year [2018]. 50 people required hospitalization for their illness since early January. Public Health France says the epidemic is intensifying in the West and North. _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes are considered to be the principal vector of dengue virus in Réunion. According to an ECDC [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control] assessment, the current outbreak is a significant event as the number of cases already exceeds the yearly number of cases reported since 2010. This epidemic could continue and intensify in the coming weeks. Based on previous _Aedes_ mosquito-borne outbreaks in the island, further transmission is expected up to the beginning of the austral winter (lasting from July to September) when the temperature will be lower.

- Reunion Island: WHO. 1 May 2018. On 16 Mar 2018, WHO was notified by the International Health Regulations (2005) National Focal Point for France through the European Commission (EC) Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) about a sharp increase in the number of dengue cases reported in La Réunion, France since the beginning of 2018. Réunion Island is a French overseas territory in the Indian Ocean. As of 23 Apr 2018, 1816 autochthonous dengue cases have been confirmed in La Réunion in 2018, including 428 probable and confirmed cases reported from 16-23 April 2018; in comparison, less than 100 cases were reported in all of 2017. The western and southern parts of the island are the most affected. The number of emergency room visits and hospitalizations related to dengue fever have been increasing; 50 hospitalizations in 2018 have been reported compared to 12 hospitalizations for all of 2017. At this stage of the outbreak, the hospitals have the capacities to provide clinical care for all of the reported cases. Since the beginning of 2017, the main circulating strain is DENV-2 (537 serotypings); other serotypes have also been detected mainly among imported cases in 2017 (4 DENV-1 and one DENV-4 serotypings). In 2014, DENV-2 was the main circulating serotype in 2014, along with DENV-1 and DENV-3; in 2016, DENV-1, was the main serotype along with DENV-2 and DENV-3. _A. albopictus_ and _A. aegypti_ mosquitos are both found in La Réunion; however, _A. albopictus_ has historically had the highest observed abundance.

Public health response
----------------------
Since 2006, notification of dengue infection to public authorities in La Réunion is compulsory. Indian Ocean Regional Office of the French Institute for Public Health (Cire OI -- Santé Publique France), in collaboration with the vector control team (Lutte anti-vectorielle, LAV) of the French Health Agency Indian Ocean (ARS-OI), is closely monitoring this outbreak. The following actions have been implemented by public authorities:
- reinforced vector control measures, focusing primarily in areas around reported dengue cases;
- enhanced surveillance of cases;
- blood and safety of substances of human origin (SoHo) safety measures implemented;
- social mobilization activities; and
- specific risk communication messages aiming to raise dengue fever awareness among the public and health care workers, including posters at points of entry (PoE) and announcements onboard flights to and from La Réunion.
On 27 Mar 2018, public authorities raised the level of the emergency plan to 3, corresponding to a low-level epidemic. This plan includes:
- active case finding;
- intensified vector control;
- reinforced communication to the public and health care workers; and
- mobilization of additional resources, including human resources (such as firefighters).

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
Although sporadic autochthonous dengue fever cases and clusters have been reported in La Réunion before, the upsurge of cases since the beginning of 2018 is unprecedented. This could be partly explained by:
- according to studies, in previous years asymptomatic cases contributed to the transmission cycle and since the proportion of asymptomatic cases was high, the virus has continued to spread unnoticed until now; and
- a lack of herd immunity in the local population, as only sporadic cases have been reported on the island before, thus favouring further transmission of the virus.
La Réunion is a popular tourist destination and the likelihood of dengue virus introduction to other countries is heightened by the current outbreak. The presence of competent mosquito vectors and the uncertainty regarding the level of dengue immunity of the local population highlight the need for enhanced risk communication and entomological and epidemiological surveillance to rapidly and effectively control the epidemic.

[2] WHO: vaccine recommendations
Date: Fri 20 Apr 2018
Source: European Scientist [edited]
https://www.europeanscientist.com/en/public-health/who-recommends-extra-safety-measures-for-sanofis-dengvaxia/


After a 2-day meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended extra safety precautions for Sanofi's dengue fever vaccine, Dengvaxia. WHO said on [Thu 19 Apr 2018] that the vaccine should only be used after testing to confirm an individual has been previously been infected.

"We have now clear information that the vaccine needs to be dealt with in a much safer way by using it exclusively in people already infected with dengue before," Alejandro Cravioto, chair of the WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunisation, told reporters on a conference call.

"It requires for the people to be tested through a system that is not currently available but that we feel will be developed in the next years," Cravioto said. Since no such test is available, the new guidelines substantially limit the market for Dengvaxia.

The French pharmaceutical company has been entangled in controversy over the vaccine, which was first approved in late 2015. Last November [2017], Sanofi warned that Dengvaxia could increase the chances of developing severe dengue in people who had never been exposed to the virus. Safety concerns and public uproar in the Philippines led the government to suspend Dengvaxia, which had been used between 2016 and 2017 in a large-scale vaccination campaign for school-aged children.

In February [2018], a government-ordered inquiry in the Philippines found Dengvaxia could be linked to up to 3 deaths in the country, but Sanofi has said it is unaware of any deaths caused by the vaccine. The company has remained firm that it is dedicated to improving health around the world and said it would continue to cooperate with authorities.

"We are confident in Dengvaxia's safety and its proven potential to reduce dengue disease burden in endemic countries," Sanofi said in a statement quoted by Reuters. Sanofi added that it would "continue to work with the international public health community and endemic countries, to ensure the best usage of the vaccine."

Mosquito-borne dengue affects up to 100 million people worldwide and is the world's fastest-growing infectious disease. Each year, the disease causes half a million life-threatening infections and kills around 20 000 people, most of them children. The disease is most dangerous when a person is infected more than once.

According to Reuters, Dengvaxia has been approved and registered in 19 countries and is currently being reviewed by the European Medicines Agency. Although Dengvaxia is the world's 1st dengue fever vaccine, Brazil's Butantan Institute, the United States National Institute of Health, and Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical are working on rival products.

[3] India (Mumbai, Maharashtra): dengue retinopathy
Date: Wed 18 Apr 2018
Source: The Hindu [edited]
http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/woman-loses-sight-to-dengue/article23578513.ece


A rare manifestation of dengue has left a 23-year-old woman from the city [Mumbai, Maharashtra] without her eyesight. Doctors have said they're perplexed by the situation. The girl had contracted dengue in November last year [2017]. So far, she has undergone 2 corrective ophthalmic procedures and is awaiting a 3rd. Doctors said after the 1st surgery on her right eye, she gradually regained 100 percent vision. However, her left eye has only 10 percent vision.

Dr Janhvi Mehta, an ophthalmologist at Jaslok Hospital, said the girl was brought to their Out Patient Department mid-November [2017]. "More than the high grade fever and rashes, her sudden blindness had the family worried. We advised she be admitted immediately." She said as per her evaluation, the girl was suffering from dengue retinopathy. Ophthalmic complications of dengue have been seen during outbreaks across the world, but instances are rare.

The patient, an accountant by profession, was brought to the hospital without perception of light in both eyes. Dr Mehta said, "In the left eye, we found a retinal detachment. In simpler words, her retina was not in place and there was a lot of fluid and blood accumulation which resulted in vision loss." In her right eye, doctors found complete opacification of the lens, which appears as a white layer.

Dr Mehta said such white layers are seen in age-related cataract cases, but in this patient, the white layer had developed within 24 hours. The patient underwent a sutureless cataract removal procedure in both eyes within 3 months, in which the cloudy lens was replaced with an artificial intraocular lens. "We are planning another procedure to correct vision in her left eye."

In January 2015, 3 similar cases were reported from Aditya Jyot Hospital in Wadala. Dr Chinmay Nakhwa, director, retina services, said referral to an ophthalmologist on time is crucial to salvage vision. He said, "The virus reduces immunity and we presume that it is the main reason why opportunistic infections like the ones in the eye are found in patients." Dr Nakhwa, who has seen five cases of patients losing sight to dengue, said vision is regained with corrective procedures.
