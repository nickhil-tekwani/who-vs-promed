[In 2006, there were 88 outbreaks reported, 13 outbreaks in 2007,
none in either 2008 or 2009. and last year (2010), only 3 outbreaks
were reported in the country. Thus, it is not surprising to see an
outbreak reported at this time. For information on avian influenza
reporting transparency prior to 2006, please see Mod.AS comments in
