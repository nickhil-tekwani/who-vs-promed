"In 2007 African swine fever (ASF) was introduced in the Caucasus and since then spread over several countries of eastern and northern Europe. The large-scale epidemic went thousands of kilometres away from its original incursion point in Georgia and, in addition to endemic establishment in domestic pigs, the disease eventually invaded populations of wild boar. In 2014-15 it became evident that circulation of this virus in the natural ecosystems had developed into a self-sustained epidemiological cycle. The disease had already become endemic in wild boar populations in several countries and was continuing to expand its range in Europe, causing very serious concerns. Controlling this sylvatic epidemic of ASF is a very challenging task for the veterinary authorities, given complexity of disease epidemiology, lack of previous experience, unprecedented geographical scope of the problem, its transboundary and multi-sectoral nature."
