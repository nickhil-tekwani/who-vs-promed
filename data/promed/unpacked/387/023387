Mucormycosis (black fungus) cases increased by 36 to 4925 in Andhra Pradesh [a state in the southeastern coastal region of India (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh) - Mod.ML] in the last one week. But only one of the infected persons succumbed to black fungus during the week, medical and health department data said. The number of cases under treatment came down from 463 to 390 in the week.

In a week, Chittoor district added 10 new cases and 1 death; Anantapuramu, 8 fresh cases; East Godavari, Prakasam, and Guntur [districts in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh], 5 each; Kurnool, 2; and Kadapa, 1. [These are 7 of the 13 districts in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. A map of Andhra Pradesh that shows the location of these districts can be found at https://irrigationap.cgg.gov.in/wrd/getDistrictMaps. - Mod.ML] The remaining 6 districts did not report any fresh cases, the data said.

Guntur now has the highest number -- 135 -- of black fungus cases under treatment, followed by Chittoor with 68, Krishna, 58, and East Godavari, 50. Six districts have less than 20 active cases, and Vizianagaram has just 1, while Srikakulam and West Godavari have none.

The data also said surgeries were performed on 4086 infected persons so far.

[A discussion of mucormycosis can be found in the moderator comments of a prior ProMED post, Mucormycosis - India: fatal, COVID/diabetes/corticosteroid predisposition 20210702.8487616. The news report above concerns mucormycosis in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, without mentioning if any of these these patients have underlying COVID-19.

The pre-COVID prevalence of mucormycosis in India was high, approximately 0.14 cases per 1000 population, about 80 times the prevalence in developed countries (https://www.mdpi.com/2309-608X/6/4/265/htm), and India is home to 77 million diabetics, 2nd highest to China with 11 million diabetics (https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/india-has-second-largest-number-of-people-with-diabetes/article29975027.ece), which may explain the high incidence of mucormycosis in India (diabetes mellitus being a major risk factor for mucormycosis).

Most cases of COVID-associated mucormycosis (CAM) have been reported from India, where it is said to be occurring in 0.27% of hospitalized COVID patients (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/9/21-0934_article). Although poorly controlled diabetes mellitus is the most common risk factor among CAM patients, 1/3 of CAM cases are reported to have no underlying predisposition, other than COVID (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/9/21-0934_article). Severe COVID-19 is treated with high doses of steroids, and improper glucocorticoid use in COVID-19 (e.g., use of glucocorticoids in mild COVID-19 cases (without hypoxaemia) or the utilization of higher doses of glucocorticoids) has been found to be an additional risk factor in CAM in India (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/9/21-0934_article).

"Abstract
----------
"We established an online registry of coronavirus disease-associated mucormycosis cases in India. We analyzed data from 65 cases diagnosed during April-June 2021, when the delta variant predominated, and found that patients frequently received antibacterial drugs and zinc supplementation. Online registries rapidly provide relevant data for emerging infections.

"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-associated mucormycosis (CAM) is an emerging systemic fungal infection caused by _Mucorales_ species. Reports of CAM are increasing, especially in India, where 187 cases have been described (1). Rapid data collection, which can be accomplished through collaborative online registries, is essential to identifying risk factors for CAM (2). We analyzed characteristics of the 1st 65 cases logged in the Mycotic Infections in COVID-19 (MUNCO) registry in India."

"The reported infections were diagnosed during April-June 2021. During this time, the B.1.617.2 lineage (delta variant) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) dominated the samples sequenced by the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium, constituting 58% of isolates in April, 88% in May, and 86% in June [2021] (5)."

"We found that most fungal infections occurred in the sinuses or eyes (Table). Amphotericin B, posaconazole, and surgery were the most common antifungal treatments. Among 53 patients with available follow-up data at 42 days, 17 (32.1%) had an incomplete recovery, 20 (37.8%) had a full recovery, 10 (18.9%) had vision loss, and 6 (11.3%) had died (Figure).

"In agreement with previous studies, we found that diabetes and steroid use were major risk factors for CAM (1,6). We also documented frequent use of antibacterial treatments, a documented risk factor for mucormycosis (10), for COVID-19. We found a lower death rate than previously reported (1); widespread awareness of CAM might have contributed to increased reporting, earlier diagnosis, and decreased steroid use for treatment of COVID-19. In total, 57% of patients received zinc supplementation, possibly because pathogenic fungi sequester zinc from host tissues. Zinc chelators inhibit the growth of some virulent fungi (7,8) and enhance the efficacy of antifungal agents against some Mucorales strains in vitro (9)."

"This study also did not have a control group of non-COVID-19-associated mucormycosis cases, which would enable detection of specific risk factors."

The figure (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/11/21-1322-f1) in this journal article shows a map of India with the geographic distribution of the 65 CAM cases logged in this study's registry, using the size of circles to indicate the number of cases. Of the 7 sites indicated on the map, the largest circle is the city of Mumbai, and the smallest is Kakinada. Kakinada is the 6th largest city of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh and serves as the district headquarters of the East Godavari district (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakinada). We are not told the exact number of cases at each of 7 sites.
