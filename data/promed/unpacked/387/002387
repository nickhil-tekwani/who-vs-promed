Indonesia: 6 with avian influenza symptoms admitted to hospital
---------------------------------------------------------------
6 Indonesian residents, including 4 children, have been admitted to a
hospital with avian influenza symptoms, spreading fears of a major outbreak
of the deadly disease in the world's fourth most populous nation.
The 6 patients have been undergoing intensive treatment at the Sulianti
Saroso Hospital, which is a specialized hospital for infectious diseases in
North Jakarta, according to a local Detikcom online report on Tue 20 Sep
2005. The latest patient is a 3 year old child who suffered from high fever
and respiratory problem. An employee with the Jakarta-based Ragunan Zoo,
where several wild fowl have been infected by avian influenza, is also
being treated at the hospital.
The government on Monday declared an "emergency situation" caused by the
avian influenza outbreak following the 4th human fatality and the growing
number of patients with avian influenza symptoms. Under the emergency
situation status, people who show avian influenza symptoms can be forcibly
hospitalized, with the government paying all financial expenses, minister
of health Fadilah Supari said.
The government has allocated the equivalent of 15.8 million US dollars in
an anti-bird flu program, but more funds will be needed, the minister said.
The Jakarta administration has temporarily closed the Ragunan Zoo after the
discovery of infected birds and ordered all of its employees to undergo
medical tests.

[As of today, only 2 of the presumptive cases of avian influenza in
Indonesia have been confirmed by laboratory testing as genuine cases of
avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection. Of the 6 patients currently in
hospital in Jakarta with avian influenza symptoms, perhaps the zoo employee
is the most likely to be confirmed. In the present circumstances, the
threat by the government of forcible hospitalization of suspected bird flu
cases might seem to be an over-reaction; the most important measure is
containment of animal disease. - Mod.CP]
