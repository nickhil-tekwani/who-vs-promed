No fewer than 4 people have been reported dead and 113 others hospitalised in a fresh cholera outbreak in the Bassa and Jos North local government areas of Plateau State. A recent outbreak of cholera in Namu, in the Qua'an Pan Local Government Area of the state, has killed more than 30 people with hundreds hospitalized.

The case in Jos North involved a 61-year-old caterer who was said to have complained of stooling and vomiting, symptoms related to diarrhea, on Sun 30 Mar 2014. The victim was rushed to the hospital, where she died on Tuesday morning [1 Apr 2014].

Local authorities in Zaria, Kaduna State say 9 persons have died as a result of a cholera outbreak in the area, while over 50 others are being treated for the disease in various hospitals.

Though findings by our correspondent indicated that the casualty figure may be higher, Zaria LG chairman Lawal Balarabe said the report in his possession showed the number of deaths and others affected only [came from] government hospitals.

"Our record relies on reports from government hospitals. We have about 15 private hospitals that don't report to us; therefore, we can't know what is happening there," he said.

But our correspondent reports that cholera, which has been ravaging Zaria for some time now, has taken a higher toll in various governments and private hospitals as well as different communities.

In Sabon Gari LGA, for example, Marmara area is worst hit. Checks at the government-owned Major Ibrahim Abdullahi Memorial Hospital revealed that many patients are on admission and are buying drugs for treatment.

"Before we went on strike, many people died in this hospital, but I can't recall the number. When we resumed, I know that one person died. From the report I have from different areas of Zaria and environs, not less than 55 persons have died", a hospital source said, but Daily Trust could not independently verify the claim.

Checks in other areas like Gyellesu revealed that 9 persons died from the disease. Other areas like Tudun Jukun, Dambo, Wuciciri, Dutsen Abba, and Tudun Wada also recorded casualties.

The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) on Tue 1 Apr 2014 said it had begun investigations into the suspected cases of cholera in Mpape area of Abuja.

The Director of the centre, Prof. Nasidi Abdulsalam, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja that samples from affected people had been collected for laboratory testing. Mpape is a suburb of the Federal Capital Territory.

According to him, the situation will not be declared as an outbreak until the laboratory result is available. "For now, we cannot say it is outbreak of cholera, as the result has yet to be confirmed," he said.
