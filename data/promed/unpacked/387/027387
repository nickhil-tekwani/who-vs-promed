Early Appearance of Virus-infected Mosquitos Around Pusan
---------------------------------------------------------
SEOUL: On Monday, 14 May 2001 the National Institute of Health (NIH)
activated
a Japanese encephalitis watch nationwide due to the recent discovery in the
vicinity of Pusan of mosquitos capable of transmitting the disease. The NIH
organized the collection of mosquitos twice a week this month in 10
different locations nationwide. Out of 87 mosquito [pools? collected at
cattle ranches, 15 were found to be Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)
positive. The detection of JEV in mosquitoes has occurred 3 weeks earlier
than the first detection last year. If further screening reveals that more
than half of the mosquitoes caught are carrying JEV, the NIH will issue a
nationwide warning.
"Individuals of all ages can show symptoms of Japanese encephalitis, but
typically, 70 to 80 percent of the patients are under the age of 15," said
Dr. Lee Jong-goo of the NIH. "Infants between 12 and 24 months and children
up to 3 years old should get vaccinated, and ranches and puddles should be
sanitized." Japanese encephalitis virus is spread by small "red-house"
mosquitoes. The disease causes high fever, headaches, nausea, and can even
lead to a coma after an incubation period of 7-20 days. The mortality rate
from the disease is 5 to 10 percent, and 20 to 30 percent of the patients
show speech impediment, [diminished reasoning ability, and a weakening of
limb movements. During the 1990s, a total of 7 persons were reported to
have suffered from the disease in Korea: 3 in 1994, 3 in 1998, and one in
1999.

[Japanese encephalitis is widespread throughout Asia and is maintained in a
cycle involving culicine mosquitoes and waterbirds. JEV is transmitted to
humans principally by _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_, which breeds in rice
fields. Pigs are the principal amplifying host. In the past a
formalin-inactivated vaccine prepared from mouse tissue has been used
widely in Korea for control of outbreaks. - Mod.CP
