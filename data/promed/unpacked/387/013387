The Plateau State Government on Monday said it had recorded 7 cases of Lassa fever in the state.

The Commissioner for Health in the state, Dr. Kamshak Kuden, disclosed this to newsmen after the State Executive Council meeting in Jos. Kuden said: "Last year [2015], between November and December, we battled with this viral haemorhagic fever. We had some casualties but we were able to contain it. However, we have recently recorded 7 cases of Lassa fever.

"We took their blood samples to Irruwa Lassa Fever Laboratory, Edo. Of them, 2 are confirmed to have the disease, 2 were negative and we are yet to get the results of the other 3. The confirmed cases include a Fulani lady from Riyom Local Government Area and a student of University of Jos. "Both of them were admitted at Jos University Teaching Hospital," [he said]. The commissioner said the student was treated and discharged, while the lady was still on admission, adding that she was, however, responding to treatment.

Kuden said those that had contact with the suspects were under surveillance. He added that the ministry had begun "contact tracing" to monitor the suspects for a period of 21 days, hoping that none came down with the virus. "What we want to tell people of the state is that Lassa fever is back and the mode of transmission is through a particular specie of rat. We want to advice people to maintain high level of sanitation and hygiene and to keep foodstuffs in rat proven containers."

The commissioner also called on health workers to keep a "very high level index of suspicion" to combat the disease. Kuden also called on disease surveillance officers in the 17 local government areas of the state to be on alert to enable them discover fresh cases early.

He said Lassa fever could be treated if discovered early.

[The case numbers are a bit confusing. It is not clear if there are a total of 7 confirmed and suspected cases, or if there are really 5 (2 confirmed and 3 suspected), since 2 cases were negative on testing. The commissioner is correct to carry out surveillance on individuals in contact with the cases, to encourage early discovery of new cases and to advise citizens to avoid direct or indirect contact with rodents in their houses. Good surveillance and rapid diagnosis is important to prevent spread in health care facilities swell as to provide timely, appropriate treatment such as ribavirin, which has been shown to be beneficial in Lassa fever, in conjunction with supportive therapy such as fluids.

The circumstances under which the reported cases acquired the Lassa fever virus infection are not mentioned. Lassa virus is endemic in rodents in Nigeria and cases can occur at any time. The infection can be contracted from an infected patient or from exposure to food materials contaminated by infected rodents.

Prevention and control of Lassa fever in nature depends on control of the rodent reservoir, which occurs across Nigeria and beyond. Reduction of populations of this rodent will require active participation at the village level. That will necessitate mounting a public education program with support of rodent control technicians. Preventing entry of rodents into the home and keeping food materials tightly covered are helpful measures to prevent infection. Appropriate use of personal protective equipment is essential to prevent virus transmission to health care workers in hospitals and clinics.

Lassa virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and can cause acute hemorrhagic fever in humans.
