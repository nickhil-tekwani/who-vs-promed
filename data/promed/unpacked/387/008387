Poliovirus Weekly Update 20-Jun-2018, World Health Organization
-----------------------
New wild poliovirus cases reported this week: 0
New cVDPV cases reported this week: 0

Headlines
- Advance notification of cVDPV1 in Papua New Guinea: Following identification last month [May 2018] of an AFP case from which VDPV type 1 had been isolated, genetic sequencing of 2 VDPV1s from 2 non-household contacts of the AFP case has now confirmed that VDPV1 is circulating and will be officially classified as a "circulating" VDPV type 1 (cVDPV1). The National Department of Health (NDOH) is closely working with the GPEI partners in launching a comprehensive response. The cVDPV1 will be officially reported in next week's data.
- Advance notification of new cVDPV2 in DR Congo: Advance notification of a new cVDPV2 case was received this week from Ituri province, in the northeast of DR Congo, close to the border with Uganda. Initial investigations are ongoing, but early reports are that the child had onset of paralysis on 5 May 2018 and has a recent travel history in Haut Katanga. Genetic sequencing indicates the case is linked to the Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga outbreak. The case will be officially reported in next week's data.

Summary of newly-reported viruses this week:
- Pakistan: 3 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) positive environmental samples
- Afghanistan: 2 WPV1 environmental samples
- Somalia: 1 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) environmental sample

Afghanistan
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) have been reported this week. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 remains 8.
- The most recent case (by date of onset) occurred in Kandahar province, with onset of paralysis on [27 Apr 2018].
- 3 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) positive environmental samples have been reported, one collected in Fata province on 19 May [2018], one collected in Peshawar district, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, on 24 May [2018], and one collected in Quetta district, Balochistan province, on 28 May [2018].

Pakistan
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) have been reported this week. The total number of officially reported WPV1 cases in Pakistan in 2018 is 3.
- The most recent case (by date of onset), occurred in Dukki, Balochistan province, with onset of paralysis on 18 May 2018.
- 2 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) positive environmental samples have been reported, one collected in Kandahar on 28 May [2018] and one in Jalalabad district, Nangarhar province, also on 28 May [2018].

Nigeria
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week.
- The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 is 4, and no cases have been reported in 2017 or 2018. The most recent WPV1 case (by date of onset) was reported in Monguno Local Government Area, Borno State, with onset on [21 Aug 2016].
- Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) is confirmed in Jigawa state, with isolation of the virus from environmental samples and one AFP case with onset of paralysis on [15 Apr 2018].
- Since confirmation of cVDPV2 in Nigeria, the country has conducted additional acute flaccid paralysis surveillance strengthening activities including enhanced active surveillance visits, and community sampling. The programme has also carried out extensive search for type 2 containing vaccines (tOPV/mOPV2) in the areas surrounding where the virus was detected.
- The GPEI is working with Regional and country counterparts and partners supporting the local public health authorities to conduct outbreak response. A round of mOPV2 vaccination covering part of Jigawa, Gombe, Bauchi and Sokoto was implemented in May [2018], and another round is planned in June [2018].

Lake Chad Basin
- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in Nigeria continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin.
- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.
- These activities include efforts to vaccinate children at markets, in internally displaced persons and refugee camps, and at international borders.
- In May [2018], a polio vaccination campaign with bOPV took place, targeting vulnerable island populations in Lake Chad. This special vaccination activity concerned Hadjer Lamis and Lac provinces.

Central Africa
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
- The total number of officially reported cVDPV2 cases in the DRC in 2018 remains 4.
- The most recent case (by date of onset) was reported in Kikula district, Haut Katanga province, with onset on [19 Feb 2018].
- The Ministry of Health, supported by WHO and partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, remains fully committed to outbreak response in the affected provinces, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) across the country, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols.
- Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.

Horn of Africa
- One new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) environmental sample was reported in the last week, from Waberi, Banadir, Somalia (collection date: 17 May [2018]).
- Advance notification was received this week of the following detected cases and samples (to be officially reflected in next week's data): Somalia: 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3) cases and one case with evidence of both cVDPV2 and cVDPV3 present; cVDPV3 environmental samples also reported.
- The case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in Somalia, in Hiran, Bulo Burti province, had onset of paralysis on [11 May [2018]. The case concerns a child who is also infected with circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3). It is unknown which virus strain caused their paralysis. This is the 1st case of paralysis involving cVDPV2 to be detected in this outbreak.
- The 2 cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3) in Somalia are both in Warsheikh district, Middle Shabelle, with onset of paralysis on 16 May and 23 May [2018]. These are the 1st cases of cVDPV3 to be detected in this outbreak.
- Outbreak response to both strains is currently being implemented, in line with internationally-agreed guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia, with additional SIAs planned in the affected zones of the Horn of Africa. Special surveillance activities are being undertaken to determine the origin of the viral circulation.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Middle East
- No new cases of circulating vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in Syria.

[While the beginning of this weekly update report looks promising with a tally of 0 newly confirmed cases of polio due to WPV and 0 newly confirmed cases of polio due to cVDPV, the remainder of the report is less promising with the advanced notifications of cases of cVDPV in Papua New Guinea (a cVDPV1), the DR Congo (a cVDPV2) and Somalia (2 cases with cVDPV3 and one case with cVDPV2 and cVDPV3 isolated).

With respect to the cVDPV1 isolated in a case of polio in Papua New Guinea, the last report of cVDPV1 associated polio was in 2016 when there was an outbreak in Laos that spanned 2015-2016 and involved 11 cases, with the most recent date of onset being 9 Feb 2016. With respect to the cVDPV2 case from Ituri province, while the case did have a history of travel to Haut Katanga, where there have been previous reports of cVDPV2 activity, the concern is the introduction of the cVDPV to another province, significantly distant from the ongoing transmission area. Lastly, the combined activity of cVDPV3 and cVDPV2 in Somalia is equally disconcerting. The most recent prior case of polio attributable to cVDPV3 was in Yemen in 2013, with a date of onset of disease 12 Jul 2013.

The reports of WPV1 positive samples in both Pakistan and Afghanistan are also troublesome, as they confirm the continued circulation of the WPV1 in those countries, signaling a non-interruption of transmission of the WPV1.

The bigger picture, with the appearance of cases of cVDPVs in areas that have interrupted transmission of the WPV and are no longer WPV endemic countries, is very reminiscent of the USA situation back in the 1970s and 1980s, when the epidemiological picture of polio within the country involved the occasional import from other countries, but, overwhelmingly, the majority of cases were related to the OPV. In those days, we did not have the refined genetic profiles of the viruses, and we did not know of cVDPVs, but still, the residual problem related to the occasional recipient of the vaccine and inadequately vaccinated individuals exposed to the vaccine virus. So, it does appear that the challenge moving forward is multi-fold; one, to finally interrupt transmission of the WPV1 in Pakistan and Afghanistan and have certainty that the WPV isn't quietly circulating undetected elsewhere (as seen in the northeast of Nigeria in recent years); and two, how to deal with the cVDPVs to interrupt their transmission, the latter task seemingly growing in order of magnitude.
