Bacterial infection linked to pedicure
--------------------------------------
The patient thought they were insect bites, but the itching sores on
her legs lingered longer than those of a mosquito's bite. Then they
ulcerated. A doctor said she probably got an infection from shaving
her legs, but the 20-year-old woman from Mesquite went to see a
dermatologist who found that the patient's legs were infected with
bacteria that proliferate in the modern whirlpool foot spas offered
during routine pedicures.
"It's unfortunate that it happened to me, but it could happen to
anyone," she said during a news conference hosted by the Dallas
County Department of Health and Human Services.
Because of such concerns, the Texas Cosmetology Commission passed new
regulations, on Mon 19 Jul 2004, that require spas and salons to
vigorously clean their equipment between each customer visit, making
Texas and California the only 2 states to have such standards,
officials said. "Since there's been such a tremendous growth in
salons, we wanted to be active in addressing the sanitation issue of
whirlpool foot spas," said Antoinette Humphrey, executive director of
the commission. Humphrey said that nearly 300 new salons open each
month, many of which use foot spas. The commission worked with the
Dallas Department of Health and Human Services, which has
investigated about a dozen similar cases since February 2004.
"Medical literature indicates that this is a widespread problem
across the U.S.," said Dr. David Buhner, DCDHS medical director.
"It's just being under-reported." Buhner, and other health officials,
said that the leg infections were unheard of until about 5 years ago,
when salons began using whirlpool spas that soothe feet prior to a
pedicure.
The culprit, nontuberculous mycobacteria, has been known to
scientists, officials said. But, they noted that the new spas use
circulation systems that trap the bacteria. The bacteria then swirls
about the legs and feet of unsuspecting customers, typically entering
the skin through tiny nicks caused by shaving.
Dr. Cynthia Clegg said the North Dallas Dermatology Associates
clinic, where she works, has treated 8 women since 1st seeing such
infections about a year ago [2003]. "It's not something we're seeing
everyday, but enough people have been infected that something needed
to be done," she said. Clegg said symptoms include a sore on the
lower leg that is not healing, or, a thick, knotted area that may
resemble a spider bite.
The new state regulations include: washing foot spa basins between
each pedicure with Environmental Protection Agency-approved
disinfectants; flushing basins for 10 minutes at the end of business
each day; soaking the basins overnight every 2 weeks with bleach; and
keeping a log of cleaning procedures.
Consumers who enjoy pedicures can avoid painful skin infections on
their legs by following these recommendations suggested by the Dallas
County Department of Health and Human Services and the Texas
Cosmetology Commission:
* Do not shave legs or have any open wounds on legs or feet before
the pedicure.
* Ask whether foot spas, or foot bath units, have been cleaned and
disinfected after each use.
* Check to see if the salon's Texas Cosmetology Commission license is
clearly posted in the reception area, and, whether the nail
technician's license is posted. A recent inspection report by the
commission should also be posted.
* Manicurists/pedicurists should wash their hands with soap and water
before touching a client's hands or feet.
* Make sure the technician is washing the instruments in hot soapy
water, and, that disinfectant is applied to the instruments. Soiled
instruments must be stored separately from clean instruments.
* Emery boards that are not approved for disinfection should be
discarded after use to prevent transmission of yeast or bacterial
infections.
* Instruments and supplies that cannot be disinfected, such as orange
sticks and the sponges placed between the toes, should be discarded
after use.
* Drill bits should be cleaned after each client.
* Leave the salon if you have any doubts about its cleanliness.
* A person who may have acquired an infection from a salon or spa
should contact a physician for immediate treatment. Manicures and
pedicures should not be painful; they shouldn't make your cuticles
bloody and swollen.

[In the California cluster posted in 2001 (20010430.0834), the
nontuberculous mycobacterium isolated was _M. fortuitum_. Although
not stated in the report, the organism may be the same in the Texas
case(s).
The California outbreak was subsequently reported in the New England
Journal of Medicine (Winthrop KL, Abrams M, Yakrus M, et al. An
outbreak of mycobacterial furunculosis associated with foot baths at
a nail salon. N Engl J Med 2002;346:1366-71. The abstract of the
report is as follows:
BACKGROUND: In September 2000, a physician in northern California
described 4 patients with persistent, culture-negative boils on the
lower extremities. The patients had received pedicures at the same
nail salon. We identified and investigated an outbreak of
_Mycobacterium fortuitum_ furunculosis among customers of this nail
salon.
METHODS: Patients were defined as salon customers with persistent
skin infections below the knee. A case-control study was conducted
that included the 1st 48 patients identified, and, 56 unaffected
friends and family members who had had a pedicure at the same salon
served as controls. Selected _M. fortuitum_ isolates, cultured from
patients, and the salon environment, were compared by pulsed-field
gel electrophoresis.
RESULTS: We identified 110 customers of the nail salon who had
furunculosis. Cultures from 34 were positive for rapidly growing
mycobacteria (32 _M. fortuitum_ and 2 unidentified). Most of the
affected patients had more than 1 boil (median, 2; range, 1 to 37).
All patients and controls had had whirlpool foot baths. Shaving the
legs with a razor before pedicure was a risk factor for infection (70
percent of patients vs. 31 percent of controls; adjusted odds ratio,
4.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.1 to 11.1). Cultures from all
10 foot baths at the salon yielded _M. fortuitum_. The _M.
fortuitum_ isolates from 3 foot baths, and 14 patients, were
indistinguishable by electrophoresis.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified a large outbreak of rapidly growing
mycobacterial infections among persons who had had foot baths and
pedicures at one nail salon. Physicians should suspect this cause in
patients with persistent furunculosis after exposure to whirlpool
foot baths.
It is very likely that this entity is much more common in many areas
than reported. - Mod. LL]
