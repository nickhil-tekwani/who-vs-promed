Declaration of the Ebola outbreak in DRC as a health emergency of international concern
----------------------------------------------------------------
- Following the recommendations of the international expert committee, WHO declared on Wed 17 Jul 2019, that the Ebola epidemic in the DRC is a health emergency of international concern.
- The Ministry of Health accepts the evaluation of the expert committee. The ministry hopes that this decision is not the result of the many pressures from different stakeholder groups who wanted to use this declaration as an opportunity to raise funds for humanitarian actors despite the potentially harmful and unforeseen consequences for the affected communities that depend greatly from cross-border trade for their survival.
- While the government continues to openly share with partners and donors how it uses the funds received, we hope that there will be greater transparency and accountability of humanitarian actors in their use of funds to respond to this Ebola outbreak.
- The Ebola epidemic is above all a public health crisis that requires a response by actors with real technical expertise. However, the main difficulty is that this epidemic occurs in an environment characterized by problems of development and shortcomings of the health system.
- Furthermore, we regret that after spending almost a year in this epidemic, certain groups of people in the community continue to adopt irresponsible behavior that causes the geographical spread of the virus. It is important to remember that in the cases of Goma and Uganda, the patients knew that they were at risk but refused to respect the health recommendations and deliberately traveled to another area. The government will consider what steps need to be taken to prevent these high-risk groups from continuing to spread the epidemic in the region.

Follow-up of the situation of the contacts of the pastor who traveled to Goma
--------------------------------------------------------------------
- Vaccination around the confirmed Goma case continues at the Afia Himbi Health Center in the Goma Health Zone. All contacts in the city were found in less than 72 hours, including the motorcycle taxi driver that the pastor had used to get to the health center. The response teams from Beni and Butembo continue the investigations to trace the pastor's journey and identify his contacts in these 2 cities.

Follow-up of the situation of the contacts of the pastor who traveled to Goma
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- On Mon 15 Jul 2019, 37 high-risk contacts and 40 contacts of the contacts of the Goma confirmed case were vaccinated at the Afia Himbi Health Center where the patient had been isolated before being transferred to the ETC. In total, 97 contacts in the broad sense have already been listed to date. Vaccination will continue until all identified contacts have been vaccinated.
- Among the contacts identified were 2 women from the pastor's family traveling with him. After the pastor's transfer to the ETC, they hid in Goma and some people thought they had fled to Bukavu in South Kivu province. Fortunately, the 2 women were found in Goma on Tue 16 Jul 2019 and will be vaccinated.

[2] WHO: PHEIC [Public Health Emergency of International Concern]
- Wed 17 Jul 2019. WHO declares PHEIC
[WHO, edited]

Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern
-----------------------------------------------------------------
WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus today [17 Jul 2019] declared the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).

"It is time for the world to take notice and redouble our efforts. We need to work together in solidarity with the DRC to end this outbreak and build a better health system," said Dr Tedros. "Extraordinary work has been done for almost a year under the most difficult circumstances. We all owe it to these responders -- coming from not just WHO but also government, partners and communities -- to shoulder more of the burden."

The declaration followed a meeting of the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee for EVD in the DRC. The Committee cited recent developments in the outbreak in making its recommendation, including the 1st confirmed case in Goma, a city of almost 2 million people on the border with Rwanda, and the gateway to the rest of DRC and the world.

This was the 4th meeting of the Emergency Committee since the outbreak was declared on 1 Aug 2018.

The Committee expressed disappointment about delays in funding which have constrained the response. They also reinforced the need to protect livelihoods of the people most affected by the outbreak by keeping transport routes and borders open. It is essential to avoid the punitive economic consequences of travel and trade restrictions on affected communities.

"It is important that the world follows these recommendations. It is also crucial that states do not use the PHEIC as an excuse to impose trade or travel restrictions, which would have a negative impact on the response and on the lives and livelihoods of people in the region," said professor Robert Steffen, chair of the Emergency Committee.

Since it was declared almost a year ago the outbreak has been classified as a level 3 emergency -- the most serious -- by WHO, triggering the highest level of mobilization from WHO. The UN has also recognized the seriousness of the emergency by activating the Humanitarian System-wide Scale-Up to support the Ebola response.

In recommending a PHEIC the committee made specific recommendations related to this outbreak [see https://www.who.int/ihr/procedures/statement-emergency-committee-ebola-drc-july-2019.pdf for the full report].

"This is about mothers, fathers and children -- too often entire families are stricken. At the heart of this are communities and individual tragedies," said Dr Tedros. "The PHEIC should not be used to stigmatize or penalize the very people who are most in need of our help."

"We commend @WHO for making this tough decision, it is right to do so. Over 1600 people have died already, with children accounting for around 1/3 of cases. The teams in DRC deserve all our thanks, respect, and support." - Josie Golding, epidemics lead

"There is a grave risk of a major increase in numbers, or spread to new locations -- as we've seen this week in Goma, again in Uganda and recently close to the border of South Sudan."

"The calling of a PHEIC is an opportunity for a change in the response to help stop Ebola spreading and save lives. A step-up in the response, led by the DRC and with full international support, is critical if we are to bring the epidemic to an end."

"This must include enhanced diplomatic, public health, security, and logistic efforts as well as releasing much needed financial resources. There is also a pressing need to introduce a second vaccine in the DRC to protect communities outside of the current outbreak zone."

"Countries should not wait for Ebola to spread across borders or appear on their doorstep before acting." @BeakerH #OutsmartEpidemics

[ITV News, abridged, edited]
https://www.itv.com/news/2019-07-17/doctor-who-discovered-ebola-praises-decision-to-declare-international-emergency/

Microbiologist Peter Piot, one of the team that discovered the virus in 1976, said currently the epidemic showed "no sign" of coming under control. Now director of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, Dr Piot said: "I hope that today's decision serves as a wake-up call to drive high-level political action, improved coordination, and greater funding to support DRC in their efforts to stop this devastating epidemic." He added: "WHO has sounded the global alarm. Now, it is up to the world to act."

On [Tue 16 Jul 2019], the UK's Department for International Development [DfID] announced a further 50 million pounds [about USD 62.451million] in funding to aid the ongoing response. DfID has so far been funding a vaccination programme, surveillance, and the construction of treatment centres.

International development secretary Rory Stewart said: "There are still a lot of things to be very, very worried about. This is not a moment for complacency -- we are literally on a knife edge. We are going to have to put a lot more money into this on a no regrets basis. It is smart to spend money now, so we don't have to spend much more later." He added: "To put it very bluntly the money is simply not coming through." Mr Stewart thanked the US for their efforts and called on the other G7 nations to do more.

Sarah Clayton-Fisher, the British Red Cross's head of region for west and central Africa, said that lack of preparation in neighbouring countries had left them very vulnerable to the disease. "A huge push and significant funding across the region are now required to contain this outbreak and bring it to an end," she said.

Efforts to contain the outbreak have also been hampered by attacks on health workers and medical centres by armed groups, with 2 Congolese health professionals being killed over the weekend.

[byline: Julia Belluz]

Before today [17 Jul 2019], WHO has only declared a public health emergency 4 times since the International Health Regulations, which govern global health emergency responses, were enacted in 2007.

The 1st time was in 2009, with the outbreak of the H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The 2nd time was in May 2014, when polio seemed to surge again, threatening the eradication effort. The 3rd time, in August 2014, came as the Ebola outbreak in West Africa was growing out of control. And the 4th was related to Zika in 2016.

These decisions are not taken lightly. Formally, a PHEIC -- pronounced "fake" -- is defined as "an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response." In reality, it's a political tool that the WHO uses to sound the alarm about a serious disease that has caught the world off guard and put people's health in danger. It's meant to draw countries' immediate attention to galvanize resources and stop the disease from spreading further across borders.

But a key consideration in declaring a PHEIC is whether the disease threat is dire enough to risk countries enacting travel and trade restrictions. Declarations can be devastating to local economies and are often associated with economic losses. The emergency committee has to agree that an outbreak meets that formal definition: that it is extraordinary, poses a high risk for other countries, and requires an immediate, coordinated global response.

WHO declares public health emergency over DRC Ebola
---------------------------------------------------
Based on the recommendation of a WHO emergency committee today [17 Jul 2019], the group's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, declared that the Democratic Republic of the Congo's Ebola outbreak is a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC).

The declaration, done under International Health Regulations, comes just days after the 1st Ebola case was detected in Goma, a city of about 2 million that straddles the Rwanda border and is the capital North Kivu province, the area hit hardest by the outbreak. Before today, the Ebola emergency committee had met 3 times -- most recently in June [2019] after imported cases were detected in Uganda -- deciding each previous time that conditions didn't constitute a PHEIC.

Concerns about rising regional threat
-------------------------------------
Health officials have been battling the outbreak for nearly a year amid several setbacks triggered by violence against response workers.

At a media briefing today [17 Jul 2019], emergency committee chairman Robert Steffen, MD, said the outbreak is still viewed as a regional and not a global threat, but he added that experts are concerned about the recent spread to Goma, recurrence of transmission in the former epicenter of Beni, and more violent attacks against responders. Also, the WHO and Uganda today said a woman from the DRC who traveled to a fish market in Uganda recently died from Ebola, prompting contact tracing in Uganda.

At the media briefing, Tedros said the detection of a case in Goma is concerning, because the city is a gateway to the rest of the DRC and the rest of the world. "It is time for the world to take notice and redouble our efforts. We need to work together in solidarity with the DRC to end this outbreak and build a better health system," he said in a statement. "Extraordinary work has been done for almost a year under the most difficult circumstances. We all owe it to these responders -- coming from not just WHO but also government, partners and communities -- to shoulder more of the burden."

He said declaring the PHEIC wasn't done for fundraising reasons, and Tedros said he wasn't aware of any donor countries withholding support without a formal declaration. However, the emergency committee aired its disappointment about delays in funding that have limited the response, especially efforts to prepare other provinces and countries to detect and prevent the spread of Ebola. He said the DRC is doing all it can to battle the outbreak, and he urged all countries to support the country, including financially.

WHO officials are still working out the details of the response strategy to cover the next 6 months, but Mike Ryan, MD, the WHO's executive director of emergency programs, estimated that cost for core operations would be more than USD 233 million.

In declaring the PHEIC today, the WHO urged countries not to use the measure as an excuse to impose trade or travel restrictions, which could hurt the DRC's economy and slow the flow of response resources needed to battle Ebola. Tedros warned that any border closures by the DRC's neighbors would force people to use informal, unmonitored crossings that would increase the risk of virus spread.

Officials grapple with vaccine issues
-------------------------------------
At today's [17 Jul 2019] media briefing, WHO officials also fielded questions about the DRC's decision last week to not allow the use and testing of a 2nd Ebola vaccine, the Johnson & Johnson Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN vaccine, which in April [2019] was recommended by a WHO vaccine advisory group as a way to increase supply and test the effectiveness of a 2nd vaccine.

Health minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD, has said he prefers to focus on the currently used vaccine, VSV-EBOV, and has aired concerns that introducing a 2nd vaccine might upset the population and complicate messaging.

In a Stat story today, Kalenga said introducing a new vaccine would create new communications and trust problems and said officials wouldn't reopen discussions about the 2nd vaccine. He also said the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which requires a 2nd dose 2 months later, would be a logistical challenge.

At the media briefing today, Ryan said there are serious concerns about the supply of VSV-EBOV and that talks are under way to speed its availability, including having the vaccine maker boost production or contracting with other companies to help make the vaccine. Earlier in the outbreak, health officials switched to a dose-sparing approach to conserve the vaccine supply. He added that the WHO recognizes the DRC health ministry's concerns and is working through the issues with the DRC government and technical partners.

Tracking more potential exposures in Uganda
-------------------------------------------
In other developments today [17 Jul 2019], Uganda's health ministry and WHO released details about the DRC woman who visited Uganda, then died from Ebola after she returned home. The groups emphasized that no new Ebola cases have been confirmed in Uganda.

An investigation revealed that the woman, who worked as a trader, went to Uganda on 11 Jul 2019 to buy fish in the Kasese district city of Mpondwe [western Uganda], one of the busiest border crossings between the DRC and Uganda. According to a situation report from the WHO's African regional office, the woman had symptoms when she arrived, and investigators found she had 4 vomiting episodes at a food vending location in the market. She returned to Beni [North Kivu, DRC] on 12 Jul 2019, where she was admitted to the city's Ebola treatment center the following day. She died on 15 Jul 2019 after tests were positive for Ebola.

According to the report, she did not use the formal border entry during her recent travels, where she would have been screened and cared for by health workers. Officials said the woman's contacts are being identified and that all will be vaccinated.

DRC outbreak total climbs to 2522
---------------------------------
In DRC developments, the health ministry yesterday confirmed 11 new cases, based on its latest statement, and is expected to announce 10 more today [17 Jul 2019], which would push the overall outbreak total to 2522. Of the cases yesterday, 5 were in Beni and 2 in Mandima; also, 4 cities each reported a single case: Mabalako, Vuhovi, Katwa, and Komanda.

Health officials are still investigating 423 suspected cases.

Another 8 people died from their Ebola infections, according to yesterday's update, raising the fatality count to 1676. Of the most recent deaths, 3 occurred in the community and 5 happened at Ebola treatment centers.

The report also had updates on response to the case in Goma, involving a pastor who died from Ebola after traveling from Butembo. So far, 97 contacts have been identified, 37 of them considered high-risk. Vaccination of contacts is under way at Afia Himbi Health Center, where the patient was isolated before he was taken to Goma's Ebola treatment center.

Two female family members who were traveling with the pastor have been located in Goma and did not flee to South Kivu as originally thought. The ministry said the women were found yesterday [16 Jul 2019] and will be vaccinated. At the media briefing today, Ryan said 257 contacts and contacts of contacts have been vaccinated and no other cases in Goma have been detected.

- Wed 17 Jul 2019. Cross-border trader's Ebola death
[LongRoom News, Reuters report, edited]
https://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKCN1UC133
[byline: Tom Miles]

A Congolese woman who died of Ebola this month [15 Jul 2019] vomited 4 times in a Ugandan market after crossing the border days earlier to sell fish, WHO said, fuelling fears that the virus may be spreading beyond Democratic Republic of Congo.

The current outbreak of the highly infectious disease has been all but confined to Congo, killing 1673 people there -- more than 2/3 of those who contracted it -- over the past year, and 3 in Uganda last month.

The fisherwoman travelled across the border to Mpondwe market on [11 Jul 2019], according to a Ugandan Health Ministry report published on [Wed 17 Jul 2019] by WHO. It said 19 fishmongers were listed as having had possible contact with her while another 590 could be targeted for vaccination.

The health response to the virus relies on tracking down and testing people who may have been exposed to it and vaccinating them and anybody they have had contact with. Ugandan and Congolese officials were working to find people who might have been put at risk by the dead woman, who appeared to have used an illegal border crossing, health ministry spokesman Emmanuel Ainebyona said. So far "no one has been found to be positive of the Ebola virus. The team is still monitoring the tested traders," he said.

The report said health workers had not established where the fishmonger spent nights, who transported her merchandise and who cleaned up her vomit. The Ministry and WHO said there were currently no confirmed Ebola cases in Uganda.

[Telegraph, UK, abridged, edited]
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/ebola-has-raging-drc-12-months-proving-hard-control/
[byline: Anne Gulland]

Ebola has been raging in DRC for 12 months: why is it proving so hard to control? Tariq Riebl, International Rescue Committee's emergency response coordinator for Ebola in DRC, said that "community engagement and continued demilitarisation" must be the top priorities of any new strategy agreed by the major partners.

Excluding local people from decision making has been an ongoing criticism. At a conference convened by aid agency Tearfund last month [June 2019], attended by local faith, civic and even armed group leaders, members of the community came up with a set of recommendations for WHO and other responders. These included ensuring that loved ones can attend their relatives' funerals -- a particular flashpoint -- and the appointment of a local person in every village to ensure dialogue between the community and the official responders.

Dr Tedros described the outbreak as more than just a health emergency and "one of the most challenging humanitarian emergencies any of us have ever faced". It is clear this outbreak is far from over.

[Voice of America (VOA) News, edited]
https://www.voanews.com/africa/children-hardest-hit-ebola-epidemic-dr-congo
[byline: Lisa Schlein]

The current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo is affecting more children than normal. The United Nations Children's Fund [UNICEF] says kids represent nearly 1/3 of current total cases, compared to about 20 per cent in previous outbreaks.

WHO reports more than 2500 cases of Ebola in eastern Congo, including nearly 1670 deaths. The UN Children's Fund says about 750 of those cases are children. UNICEF spokeswoman Marixie Mercado says children under age 5 are especially hard hit, and account for 40 per cent of infections. She notes an exceptionally high number of children are succumbing to the virus. "The case fatality ratio or the number of cases who die among this group of under-5s is 77 per cent. That is compared with 67 per cent among the general population, which means that young children are at higher risk than adults," she said.

Mercado says Ebola affects children very differently from adults. Consequently, she says they need specialized care, both medically and psychologically. She says children infected with Ebola receive the same drugs as adults, but they require smaller dosages. She says they also require treatment for diarrhea, against intestinal parasites and special nutritional feeding. She says children who are separated from their parents or orphaned from Ebola need longer term psycho-social care and support to help them get over their loss. "Virtually all of them need help to counter the debilitating effects of stigma and discrimination that taints children affected by Ebola. They need to be accepted, valued, and loved by their families and communities," she said. ln Congo, Mercado says dedicated pediatricians provide special medical care for children in Ebola treatment centers. She says every child is assigned a dependable caregiver who also is an Ebola survivor and therefore immune to the disease.

- Wed 17 Jul 2019. Vaccine debate
[STAT News, edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2019/07/17/debate-testing-second-ebola-vaccine/
[byline: Helen Branswell]

An aggressive push to use a 2nd experimental Ebola vaccine to try to help stop the nearly yearlong outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo may have backfired, with the DRC's health minister insisting the country will not allow use of the vaccine, made by pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson.

The health minister, Dr Oly Ilunga, had previously suggested a consortium made up of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Doctors Without Borders, and others might be permitted to conduct a clinical trial of J&J's Ebola vaccine in the country, although not in the outbreak zone, where Merck's experimental vaccine is being used.

Late last week [week of 8 Jul 2019] he rescinded that option, saying the country would not approve a trial of another experimental vaccine during the ongoing outbreak. "There's a whole debate raging around vaccinations. And we need to close down this debate," Ilunga said Monday at a WHO meeting called to share updates on the outbreak with partners in the response and donor countries. "We have an effective weapon. ... Let's focus on that."

That remark seemed to be a rebuttal to Dr Josie Golding, epidemics lead at the Wellcome Trust, who moments earlier had urged the DRC to reconsider its decision to block use of other vaccines at this time. The Wellcome Trust is part of the consortium. Golding said the Wellcome Trust strongly believes there is an urgent need to deploy and test the 2nd experimental vaccine, of which there are over a million doses available. "We regret the recent announcement against the use of the J&J vaccine and ask for this to be reconsidered. The lives of the people in North Kivu, across DRC and the region, depend on it," she said.

Peter Piot, dean of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, issued a statement Monday questioning the DRC's decision, saying his institution trusts "the Minister's decision [will] be reconsidered."

But in an interview with STAT, Ilunga appeared unswayed. He criticized the actions of some who want to add the J&J vaccine to the outbreak response arsenal. "We are in the presence of a very, very dangerous situation. We have people who don't want to discuss [their plans] with the government. People who have no respect for ethics. And they are ready to introduce a new vaccine and to create new communications problems and trust problems with the community," he said. "So I just made the decision to say no. We are not going to start a discussion again."

J&J was more circumspect in its response to Ilunga's announcement. "We respect the decision of the DRC minister of health regarding Ebola vaccine studies in the country," Dr Paul Stoffels, chief scientific officer and the main driver of J&J's Ebola vaccine effort, said in a statement. "We remain ready to mobilize our resources if we are called on to help with outbreak response efforts."

Talks have been under way for months among partners in the response about how to use the current outbreak to test unlicensed Ebola vaccines and whether additional unlicensed vaccines could help contain the outbreak. No Ebola vaccines have yet been licensed in Western countries, though Merck has started the approvals process with the Food and Drug Administration. Russia and China have licensed vaccines, but both countries licensed the products without human effectiveness data to support their use.

Ebola vaccines and therapies have been hindered for years by an unfortunate reality. The only way to test if they actually work is to conduct clinical trials during an Ebola outbreak -- a highly challenging time in which to do research.

The unprecedentedly large West African outbreak of 2014-2016 allowed for some clinical trials to take place. But only one -- testing the Merck vaccine in Guinea -- was able to generate results. The outbreak ended before trials could determine if other experimental vaccines or any of the experimental Ebola drugs worked.

Based on the Guinea trial results, WHO advised that the Merck vaccine -- which is given in a single dose and generates a protective response in about 10 days -- should be used in future outbreaks until there is a licensed vaccine. But organizations involved in funding the development of these vaccines such as the Wellcome Trust and CEPI -- the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations -- have been pressing for others to be deployed as well to determine if they work.

In April [2019], the WHO's vaccines advisory committee, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization, strongly urged that trials of other vaccines be conducted in DRC.

While there has been discussion about whether to test the Chinese or the two Russian vaccines, none of these vaccines is currently available in mass quantities. The only other vaccine for which there is a large supply is the J&J vaccine. And for months discussions have been under way about how and where to use the vaccine.

In late June [2019], it appeared the DRC would be open to the testing of other vaccines. After a two-day meeting in Kinshasa, Ilunga said the country would consider approving applications for vaccine trials so long as Congolese scientists were involved and the vaccines were tested in other parts of the country, not near where Ebola is spreading. Those pushing for the use of the J&J vaccine had proposed using the vaccine to create a firewall, vaccinating people near but outside the outbreak zone to prevent the virus from spreading into new territory.

But there have been serious concerns raised about the communications and logistical challenges a trial of another vaccine would pose, especially the J&J product, which was designed to be used to prevent outbreaks, not stop them. It must be administered in 2 doses given nearly 2 months apart. Some DRC and NGO officials worried it might be difficult to communicate why some people were getting a one-dose vaccine while others got one requiring 2 shots, and that the different schedules might give rise to rumors that would erode confidence in and acceptance of the vaccines. The dosing schedule would be difficult to implement in north eastern DRC, where there are large numbers of displaced people and the population moves about over long distances, Ilunga said.

"How can you, in an environment where people are traveling a lot, where people have no identity card, how can you organize a 2-dosage vaccination in rural areas?" he asked. "You vaccinate somebody today and say, 'Come back 2 months later.' ... Even from a logistical point of view, it's not feasible." Ilunga said that, instead of modifying the study protocol to take into account the conditions the DRC had set, those designing the study of the J&J vaccine continued to plan for a trial that would also serve as a firewall, citing confidential emails that had been shared with him. "So they were deliberately ignoring the conclusion of the forum and the decision made by the minister of health," Ilunga said. "This for me is unacceptable."

Word of the possible introduction of another vaccine was starting to spread, Ilunga said, with some community leaders asking about it. He also disputed one of the arguments made to support use of the J&J vaccine -- the concern that supplies of the Merck vaccine will may run out before the outbreak is over. Since the vaccination began early last August [2018], more than 162 000 people have been vaccinated with the Merck vaccine.

As of June [2019], there were roughly 500 000 doses currently available, with another 200,000 doses currently in production that should be available next January [2019]. "We are in a very critical outbreak in a very complex environment," Ilunga said. "We want to have all the human resources dedicated to the outbreak. We don't want people to be diverted in another clinical trial elsewhere in the country."

Ebola just 'a plane ride away' -- containing the current outbreak
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Lessons learned in 2014 in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea can hardly be applied to a country torn apart by ongoing violent conflict and feuding political factions. Complicating the response and containment efforts further is the lack of trust in healthcare workers, who frequently come under attack by rebel forces.

Thus, it came as no surprise when, on 10 Jun 2019, the Ugandan Ministry of Health confirmed the cross-border spread of the virus and the first case of Ebola in Uganda.

Although the DRC and Uganda may seem half a world away, experts warn that Ebola in Africa is by no means an African problem. International travel and ongoing immigration from Africa to Europe, as well as the long incubation period of the Ebola virus (between 2 and 21 days), (1) make it a challenge to contain the spread of disease.

"With our increasingly connected world, infectious diseases are only an airplane ride away, making it possible for a person exposed to Ebola in rural Africa to be in a major metropolitan city within 36 hours," says Krutika Kuppalli, MD, affiliated assistant clinical professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine and member of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) Global Health Committee. "Ebola not only leads to considerable loss of life and burden on the healthcare system, but it can also have a profound socioeconomic impact. For example, the World Bank estimated that the three countries mainly affected by the 2014 West African outbreak lost USD 2.2 billion in gross domestic product. Although it may not be apparent, these losses have a downstream effect with worldwide implications."

Should we worry about Ebola in the United States?
-------------------------------------------------
Experts largely agree that the risk is not very high at the moment.

"Ebola is not a very contagious disease," says Peter Jay Hotez, MD, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. "The way we express that is the reproductive number, which is just under 2 in the case of Ebola (2) -- this means that if an individual has Ebola, on average only 2 other individuals will get it if they're taking care of dying or recently deceased Ebola patients. That's in contrast to measles, which is one of the most highly contagious diseases with a reproductive number of 12-18, because the virus persists in the environment."

Kuppalli agrees that the chances of Ebola reappearing in the United States are currently not high but cautions that things could change very quickly. "Northeastern DRC has been plagued by years of violence, leading to mass displacement of Congolese fleeing the area," she says. "Owing to the mobile population, there is an increased risk of individuals who have been exposed to Ebola crossing the border into one of the surrounding countries. This is illustrated by the recent cases of Ebola that spread into Uganda earlier this month. How quickly the virus could spread is best demonstrated by a contact in the DRC who moved to Dubai this past week and is now being monitored there."
