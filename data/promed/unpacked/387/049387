Assessment of the outbreak of bluetongue serotype 8 in Europe, 2007
(July-December)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Authored by EFSSA's food and animal-health risk
assessment unit, based upon data from the following sources:
Afsca, Afssa (Lerpaz), Cirad, European
Commission, Defra, DGAl, DG-SANCO ADNS, DVFA,
Germany's Ministry of Agriculture, FVO (Belgium), ProMED.

Situation as of 8 Jan 2008
--------------------------
1. General situation in Europe

In 2006, an outbreak of BTV-8 involved 5 countries in Europe; more
than 2000 households were reportedly affected (Table 1, Map 1) [For
these and the following maps, tables and figures, mentioned in this
text, subscribers are referred to the original report in French, at
the above URL. - Mod.AS]. Following a silent period during the
vector's inactivity [cold] season, a massive epizootic was observed,
starting July 2007. Nearly 50 000 infected households [farms,
outbreaks; see commentary. - Mod.AS] have been reported since then, in
9 European countries (Table 1, Map 2, Figure 1).

2. France

In France, the 1st BTV-8 outbreak in 2007 was confirmed on 27 Jul
2007. In total, as of 7 Jan 2008, 14 264 outbreaks (infected farms)
were confirmed (Afssa-Lerpaz; CIRAD; DGAl). The epizootic peak was
reached in October 2007 (Figure 1).

A total of 58 metropolitan departments are affected (Map 3; regulated
areas for BTV in France to 2 Jan 2008). The disease has spread from
the north-east of France to the rest of the territory. In the 9
northeastern departments, about 70 percent of the households were
affected (map 3). On 7 Jan 2008, new clinical suspects are under
investigation indicating that the period of vector inactivity has not
begun yet. [Data on new BTV-8 cases in the affected countries, during
January/February 2008 and particularly from France, are rather
conflicting. Seropositivity may reflect old infections and not
necessarily recent vector activity. 1st hand, scientifically-based
information will be helpful and appreciated. - Mod.AS]

3. Situation in the other Member States (2007)

Germany

In Germany, the 1st BTV-8 outbreak in 2007 was
confirmed on 6 Jul 2007. As of 28 Dec 2007, 20
276 households have been notified infected
according to information provided by the Ministry
of Agriculture. Similar to 2006, Germany is the
country most severely affected in 2007. The
outbreaks are mostly located in the western half
of the country (Link to map, 28 Dec 2007). To our
knowledge, the vector inactivity period has not
started yet [7 Jan 2008] in Germany.

Belgium

In Belgium, the 1st BTV-8 outbreak in 2007 was confirmed on 7 Jul
2007. As of 18 Dec 2007, 6598 households have been notified infected
according to information provided by the Federal Agency for the Safety
of the Food Chain (Afsca). 4187 (63 percent) of the households are
cattle, 2398 (36 percent) sheep and 13 goats. Outbreaks have been
reported throughout the territory, but the western 3rd of the country,
where the densities of cattle and sheep farms are highest, is more
heavily affected (Link to map, 18 Dec 2007). The period of vector
inactivity [due to cold weather. - Mod.JW] began on 13 Dec 2007.

Netherlands

In the Netherlands, the 1st BTV-8 outbreak in
2007 was confirmed on 25 Jul 2007. As of 4 Jan
2008, 6442 households have been notified infected
according to information provided by the Dutch
authorities. The entire country's territory is
affected (Link to map, 24 Dec 2007). The period
of vector inactivity began on 12 Dec 2007.

Luxembourg

In Luxembourg, the 1st BTV-8 outbreak in 2007 was confirmed on 17 Aug
2007. As of 20 Dec 2007, 1315 households have been notified infected
according to information obtained via the ADNS system (EU's Animal
disease notification system). The entire country's territory is
affected (Link to map, 28 Dec 2007). The period of vector inactivity
began on 21 Dec, 2007.

United Kingdom

In the United Kingdom, the 1st BTV-8 outbreak in
2007 was confirmed on 22 Sep 2007. As of 4 Jan
2008, 67 households (outbreaks) have been
notified infected according to information
provided by the Department for Environment, Food
and Rural Affairs (Defra). The last indigenous
outbreak was confirmed on 6 Dec 2007. The
affected households are located in the
southeastern area. [The most recent update of
UK's BTV-8 protection and surveillance zones,
as of 29 Feb 2008, with map is available at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/notifiable/bluetongue/pdf/declaration-bt-pzsz080229.pdf>.
- Mod.AS]

The period of vector inactivity began on 20 Dec 2007.

Denmark

In Denmark, a single focus of BTV-8 was notified
on 13 Oct 2007, on the south-eastern island of
Lolland, according to information provided by the
Danish veterinary and food administration (DVFA).
No other outbreaks have been reported. The period
of vector inactivity began on 21 Dec 2007.

Switzerland

In Switzerland, 5 households have reportedly been infected with BTV-8
between 28 Oct 2007 and 30 Nov 2007 according to information provided
by the Swiss Federal Veterinary Office (FVO). The households are
located in 3 neighbouring districts of northwestern Switzerland,
bordering Germany. The period of vector inactivity began on 10 Dec 2007.

Czech Republic

In the Czech Republic, a single focus of BTV-8 was notified on 28 Nov
2007 in the west, adjacent to the Czech-German border. No other
outbreaks have been reported.

U-turn expected on Scottish bluetongue vaccination decision to counter
a 'flare-up' of the disease this summer
------------------------------
The Scottish Government is expected to confirm a
reversal of its position on bluetongue
vaccination after it meets livestock sector
stakeholders next week [3-7 Mar 2008]. The news
came as George Milne, the National Sheep
Association's development officer, addressed
farmers meeting at Duns in the Scottish Borders.

Until last week, the majority of livestock
representatives in Scotland, and the Scottish
Government, opposed vaccination and were hoping a
tough attitude on imports from Europe, and the
post-movement testing of incoming stock from
England and Wales, would protect the Scottish industry.

However both government and industry leaders are
now expecting an order for 12 million doses of
bluetongue vaccine. The order is expected to be
placed by Scotland's chief vet immediately after
the stakeholder meeting and will be used to
protect all of Scotland's susceptible ruminants.

The delay came as EU rules demand that only
livestock within a bluetongue protection zone
(PZ) can be vaccinated, and Scotland had come
under growing pressure to maintain its Free Area
status. Free Area status had allowed the
unimpeded live delivery of non-vaccinated stock
to other countries that were also free of
bluetongue controls and allowed Scottish farmers
to avoid tight movement restrictions

"The message had been to keep Scotland free of
restriction for as long as possible because 2000
live lambs a week were being exported to the
Republic of Ireland and the regular delivery of
live cows and other slaughter stock to Northern
Ireland was boosting ex-farm prices too," said
George Milne. "Being in the Free Area has helped
this trade, but it is now obvious that Scotland
must vaccinate against bluetongue this summer to
counter expected flare-ups and that this is done quickly and properly."

It is expected the Scottish Government will not
order vaccine from Intervet, which is
manufacturing 22.5 million doses for Defra, but
will use another company so it can avoid the
queue and speed up delivery. The strategy for
vaccination in Scotland is not yet clear and with
some industry representatives favouring a
compulsory approach, the additional bureaucracy
could delay vaccine distribution even further.

The likelihood of a bluetongue vaccination
strategy received a mixed reaction from the
Scottish industry this week. Speaking at NFU
Scotland's annual meeting, Scotland's chief vet,
Charles Milne said the country should be kept a
free area for as long as possible. He said
Scotland's trade with Northern Ireland was a key
factor in maintaining the country's free status.

The Northern Ireland authorities were
particularly anxious the country should remain
bluetongue free as they did not want to be seen
to be introducing bluetongue into the Irish Republic.

He said research indicated that bluetongue could
spread from an infected area at the rate of about
15km per year, meaning that, at present, it was
likely to be a long time before the disease could
reach Scotland. [Reference for the '15km per
year' statement will be appreciated. - Mod. AS].

A vaccination programme will also bring
complications, he warned, with Scotland having to
declare a PZ in order to vaccinate livestock.
This would allow infected animals to be brought
into Scotland from other PZs across the EU and
Charles Milne warned that any vaccination
programme should therefore begin in winter to
protect animals prior to the high risk summer months.

NFUS also heard from cabinet secretary for rural
affairs, Richard Lochhead, who said there was a
clear industry desire to keep Scotland free of
the disease and associated restrictions for as
long as possible, but there was no permanent
right answer in dealing with disease.

The decision to vaccinate was welcomed by
bluetongue experts this week, among them Dr. Ruth
Watkins ­-- a virologist who has advised Defra and
the European Commission on vaccine policies. They
warned that the most effective programmes begin
in winter, well before the first infected midges
re-emerge, and while this year's activities will
help to curb disease spread, a better targeted
and more coordinated campaign will be essential
in 2009. They also said that vaccines in
Scotland, England and Wales would arrive too late
in the season to be fully effective -- and that
there will be gaps in vaccine cover because not
enough doses have been ordered to cover all susceptible ruminants.

"But Defra should be praised for being the 1st
EU government [department] to take vaccination
seriously and set in train moves that are the
only way to prevent serious long term damage from
BTV-8 and pave the way to eradication," said
Dutch vet Dr. Daan Dercksen who was speaking at Duns, Scotland.

According to specialists, full eradication of
BTV-8 in north-west Europe would rest on a
cross-EU effort requiring at least 150 million
doses of vaccine annually over a 3 year period
and properly coordinated distribution in all
member states. So far, the only countries to
order vaccine are England and The Netherlands --
which has ordered 6 million doses.

Dr. Watkins told farmers 'limitless' volumes of
bluetongue vaccine would be available across the
EU by winter 2009, but until then it would be
impossible to raise a completely effective barrier against disease spread.

She said: "Vaccine used in Britain this summer
will help to suppress the level of virus being
carried by the midge population, especially if it
is directed first at cattle. "This in turn will
reduce the number of infected sheep and limit the
economic damage caused by infection in both
species ­ but it will not prevent infection
spread entirely. Britain must try to use vaccine
this year even though it will not arrive at the
perfect time and its distribution will be
imperfect. However it is important that is distributed before August [2008]."

Specialists were keen a marker vaccine, which
would allow vaccination to be confirmed through a
blood test, should replace the current vaccine.

[The need for vaccination and its urgency have
been underlined since the onset of the epizootic
in Europe. Already one-season-too-late,
significant additional losses may still be
prevented. This relates in particular to
receptive, not yet infected areas, where the
vaccine should be applied before summer 2008. - Mod.AS]
