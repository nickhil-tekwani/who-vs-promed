2nd Case of CWD Found in Oneida County Deer
State's Trace Back Finds 2nd Positive CWD in Herd Directly Linked to Index Herd
-----------------------------------------------
A 2nd positive case of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in New York State has
been confirmed in a white-tailed deer from a captive herd in Oneida County
that is directly linked to the herd where a white-tailed doe was found
positive for CWD earlier this week.
CWD is a transmissible disease that affects the brain and central nervous
system of deer and elk. There is no evidence that CWD is linked to disease
in humans or domestic livestock other than deer and elk.
During the investigation of the State's 1st case of CWD this week, the New
York State Department of Agriculture and Markets found that one of the
herds associated with the index animal had recently sent a sample to the
State's Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory to be tested for CWD. The sample
was collected and sent for testing as part of the State's mandatory CWD
surveillance and testing protocols.
The positive sample was from a 2.5-year-old white-tailed deer that died
from aspiration pneumonia, which is often but not exclusively associated
with CWD. Due to the direct association with the index herd, the Department
expedited the testing procedure by re-routing the sample to the National
Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa, which late yesterday found
the sample to be positive for CWD.
2 days ago, the New York State Departments of Agriculture and Markets, and
Environmental Conservation announced the State's 1st case of CWD, found in
a 6-year-old white-tailed doe from a captive herd in Oneida County. The
deer was sampled as part of the State's Enhanced CWD
Surveillance and Monitoring Program.
-------------------------------
Currently, the index herd and the 6 other associated herds, including the
2nd positive herd, are under quarantine. All animals remaining in the index
herd and the herd with the 2nd confirmed positive herd will be depopulated
and tested for CWD. The investigation to determine the source of the
infection is ongoing.
The New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets will continue to
seek any susceptible deer that came into contact with either herd and to
assess the health and environmental risks associated with such establishments.
The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation will continue
to conduct intensive monitoring of the wild deer population surrounding the
2 positive herds to determine if CWD has spread to wild deer.
CWD is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) of deer and elk.
Scientific and epidemiological research into CWD is ongoing. To date,
research shows that the disease is typified by chronic weight loss, is
always fatal, and is transmissible between susceptible species. CWD has
been found only in members of the deer family in North America, which
include white-tailed deer, mule deer, elk and moose.

regarding the 1st positive case of CWD in New York State can be found at

2nd case of CWD confirmed
------------------
Chronic wasting disease was discovered in a 2nd captively held deer in
central New York, days after the deadly malady was first detected in the
state, agricultural officials said Saturday.
Both white-tailed deer had been part of captive herds in Oneida County. The
2nd positive case was discovered in a small herd that had taken in animals
from the herd that yielded the initial positive case earlier this week,
according to the state Department of Agriculture and Markets.
Chronic wasting disease -- or CWD -- is a degenerative neurological illness
that is deadly to some deer and elk species. There is no evidence that CWD
is harmful to humans or other domestic livestock.
New York agricultural officials said they were trying to determine the
source of the disease in both of the dead animals, but stressed it should
not be considered a public health threat.
"This is an animal health issue first and foremost. There's no link to
disease in humans," said state agricultural spokeswoman Jessica Chittenden.
"We're doing everything we can to control this."
The herd that yielded the initial positive, as well as 6 other captive
herds that potentially came into contact with that herd, have been
quarantined. Animals in the 2 herds with deer that tested positive will be
killed and tested for CWD. State officials are also testing wild deer in
Oneida County. State officials have not identified the herd owners.
CWD has been detected in wild and captive deer and elk populations in 12
states in the West and Midwest.
Scientists don't know how the disease is transmitted among animals.
Symptoms of the disease include weight loss, stumbling, tremors, lack of
coordination and listlessness.
