Bird flu detected at farm near Cambodian capital
------------------------------------------------
A farm near the Cambodian capital was closed after about 2300 chickens died
of bird flu, apparently the 1st cases of the disease in the country
following an epidemic in Asia earlier this year [2004].
The remaining 2200 birds at the farm, located about 5 km (3 miles) outside
Phnom Penh, were destroyed on Wednesday [22 Sep 2004] and earlier this week
[4th week of Sep], said Hun Sokha, the farm's owner. Hundreds of chickens
fell ill and started dying on Saturday [18 Sep], he said.
Testing by the Pasteur Institute in Phnom Penh confirmed the bird flu
strain of H5N1, said Som Sin, head of the local agriculture office.
The earlier outbreak of bird flu killed, or forced the slaughter of, more
than 100 million birds across 10 Asian countries. It jumped from poultry to
people in Viet Nam and Thailand, killing 28 people. Bird flu was found in
12 areas of Cambodia during the epidemic. There were no human victims in
the country, but, more than 30 000 chickens, ducks, and other fowl were
slaughtered to prevent the disease from spreading.

[According to the last official report from Cambodia to the Office
International des Epizooties, received 26 Jul 2004, "despite on-going field
investigations, no new cases of HPAI have been confirmed since 1 Apr 2004."
Cases of avian influenza may occur year round, but there is a seasonal
pattern, since the survival and the viability of influenza A virus are
known to increase at lower environmental temperatures. For instance, since
2001, H5N1 viruses have continued to circulate in mainland China with a
seasonal pattern, peaking from October to March, when the mean temperature
is below 20 C. For further details, see Li, Guan et al, "Genesis of a
highly pathogenic and potentially pandemic H5N1 influenza virus in eastern
Asia," Nature 430, 209 - 213 (8 Jul 2004).
In view of the approaching fall months, significantly enhanced and
energetic control measures will be required to prevent the upsurge of avian
influenza in domestic fowl in south-east Asia. - Mod.AS]
