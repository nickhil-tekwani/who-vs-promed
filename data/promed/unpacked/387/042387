I am greatly disturbed that you chose to post the self-serving item
submitted by Dr. Martin. Such postings undermine the credibility of
ProMED-mail as a reliable source of public health information. Dr. Martin
has for years promulgated his unproven theories on the relationship between
"stealth viruses" (and now "viteria") and a variety of illnesses, to the
public. Requests by the California Department of Health Services and
Federal personnel for Dr. Martin to share both reagents and data have been
repeatedly refused by Dr. Martin. ProMED-mail should, at the very least,
solicit its readers in the scientific community as to the veracity of Dr.
Martin's claims.
