In the EU/EEA, only 2 non-HUS [hemolytic uremic syndrome] STEC [Shiga
toxin producing _Escherichia coli_] cases were reported to have fallen
ill within the last 10 days (17 Jul-26 Jul 2011), all in Germany.
These are 2 probable cases, not yet confirmed as STEC O104. The last
known date of illness onset in a patient with confirmed STEC O104 was
7 Jul 2011. The last reported date of illness onset among all
(probable and confirmed) cases was 17 July 2011.

As of today, 27 Jul 2011, the cumulative number of confirmed STEC
cases in the EU/EEA is 941. This includes 264 HUS STEC cases and 677
non-HUS STEC cases. Additionally, there are 518 probable HUS STEC and
2451 probable non-HUS STEC cases, with no confirmation of STEC O104 at
present time. In total, in the EU, 46 persons have died of confirmed
or probable STEC infection. Of these, 29 were HUS STEC cases and 17
were non-HUS STEC cases. The table below shows the distribution of
cumulative probable and confirmed STEC cases per country.

The Robert Koch Institute declared on 26 Jul 2011 the outbreak in
Germany as officially over, as the last date of onset for a case with
an epidemiological link, was 4 Jul 2011, 3 weeks ago. Since the last
update on 26 Jul 2011, Germany has reported 9 non-HUS STEC cases and 1
HUS STEC case. Cases reported with onset after 4 Jul 2011 are
considered by Germany as having no epidemiological link with the
initial outbreak or for which no laboratory confirmation is available.
Other Member States have not reported any new cases since the last
update.

Total of probable and confirmed cases:
Member States / HUS cases (deaths) / non-HUS cases (deaths)
-----------------------------------------------------------
Austria / 1 (0) / 4 (0)
Czech Republic / 0 (0) / 1 (0)
Denmark / 10 (0) / 16 (0)
France/ 9 (0) / 4 (0)
Germany / 733 (28) / 3 052 (17)
Greece / 0 (0) / 1 (0)
Luxembourg / 1 (0) / 1 (0)
Netherlands / 4 (0) / 7 (0)
Norway / 0 (0) / 1 (0)
Poland / 2 (0) / 1 (0)
Spain / 1 (0) / 1 (0)
Sweden / 18 (1) / 35 (0)
UK / 3 (0) / 4 (0)
Total / 782 (29) / 3128 (17) = 3910 cases and 46 deaths

[These numbers can still change if additional suspected cases are
either confirmed or ruled out. We await further information on this
quite unusual epidemic caused by a chimeric
enterohemorrhagic/enteroaggregative _E. coli_ O104:H4 causing the
largest number of deaths in an EHEC [enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_]
outbreak and affecting primarily adults rather than children. Besides
more epidemiologic and clinical observations, it will be important to
see if 2 modalities of therapy, a monoclonal antibody eculizumab
directed against a complement component and the use of certain
antimicrobials especially imipenem as adjuvant treatment.

As the commentaries below spell out, there is much we have learned so
far about this epidemic but substantially more to learn from it. Once
more, Mother Nature has shown herself to be the world's best
bioterrorist. - Mod.LL]

[2] Commentary
Date: Wed 27 Jul 2011

Germany's infectious disease institute has declared that the _E. coli_
O104:H4 outbreak is over, now that the incubation period for the most
recently confirmed case with links to the sprout seed-related event
has passed.

Because of reporting delays, additional cases are still slowly
trickling into the ECDC. Health officials are also still sorting out
confirmed and probable cases. So far the ECDC has received reports of
3910 infections, including 782 with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a
serious kidney complication. So far 46 deaths have been reported. A
few cases, most with links to German travel, were also reported in the
United States and Canada.

The ECDC, in an 8 Jul 2011 risk assessment, warned that sporadic cases
and new clusters would likely continue to be reported, because some of
the contaminated seeds could still be on the market or in people's
homes, cross-contamination during food handling could occur, and
foodborne transmission could be linked to people with asymptomatic
infections.

Craig Hedberg, PhD, a foodborne disease expert at the University of
Minnesota School of Public Health, said that though the outbreak might
be considered "over," there are still concerns about fenugreek seeds
from potentially contaminated lots that have not been accounted for.
He said the outbreak has taught some useful lessons and raised some
issues that warrant follow-up discussion.

European officials seemed in a rush to publish preliminary data that
suggested the outbreak involved an unusually virulent
enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) strain when the full extent of
exposure to the implicated food wasn't known, Hedberg said. "If we
don't know the size of the denominator, the numerator is just a
number."

Omitting sprouts in the original case-control study was an error that
German health officials made and that led to the spurious association
with cucumbers, lettuce, and tomatoes, Hedberg said. The same mistake
has been made in other outbreaks elsewhere, he said, which should be a
lesson for future outbreak investigations.

Hedberg said the reason given for omitting sprouts from the 1st
case-control study was that fewer than half of the sick patients
reported eating them. "This is not acceptable, because sprouts are a
known previous vehicle, thus should have been part of any case-control
study," he said. "And although they were reportedly eaten by fewer
than half of cases, they were eaten by a higher proportion of cases
than would have been anticipated, based on background rates of sprout
consumption in the population.

Enterohaemorrhagic _Escherichia coli_ O104:H4: are we prepared now?
------------------------------------------------------------------
[Author: AW Friedrich, Department of Medical Microbiology and
Infection Control, University Medical Centre Groningen, University of
Groningen, the Netherlands]

It is over. The outbreak of the _E. coli_ O104:H4 infection that had
its major focus in Germany (1) and affected people in many other
European countries has officially come to an end (2). While the media
coverage has been decreasing, the scientific community has been
working to understand the reason why this dramatic outbreak occurred.
We have learnt that the pathogen is not a totally new clone, but is a
slight variant of a known, although rarely described organism, called
HUSEC-41 (3) with an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)
resistance. Furthermore, the strain carries genes typically found in 2
types of pathogenic _E. coli_, the enteroaggregative and
enterhaemorrhagic pathotypes (4,5). It specifically carries the genes
for the classical haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)-associated Shiga
toxin 2.

Despite the efforts that have been made, major questions currently
remain unanswered, such as why women were affected more than men, why
the attack rate was so high, what the primary source was and what the
reservoir is, how long people are carriers, what the importance of the
ESBL resistance is, what the infectious dose is for this outbreak
strain, and what the role of secondary transmission is via symptomatic
or asymptomatic carriers, directly to other persons or indirectly via
an index source, such as food.

It is known that up to 15 percent of EHEC cases can be a result of
secondary transmission arising from household contact with people who
have sporadic EHEC infections (6). In this issue of Eurosurveillance,
2 articles, Aldabe et al. (7) and Hauri et al. (8) report on secondary
transmission during the EHEC O104:H4 outbreak.

The 1st reports on a symptomatic man who transmitted EHEC to his wife
and young daughter during the EHEC O104:H4 infection in France (7).
Interestingly, the EHEC that was isolated from the mother apparently
lost its ESBL resistance, confirming the known mobility of plasmids
carrying resistance genes. This fact should be taken into
consideration in diagnostic laboratories if ESBL resistance of EHEC
O104:H4 is used for primary selection of the pathogen from stools
without using also non-selective enrichment and detection of Shiga
toxin genes.

The 2nd article (8) illustrates in detail the history of 6 possible
household transmissions, 2 possible nosocomial, and 1 possible
laboratory transmission in the German State of Hesse, where satellite
clusters occurred. These cases throw light on 3 crucial issues. First,
secondary transmission of EHEC O104:H4 was shown not to be more
frequent than expected. Second, the importance of microbiological
serotyping was highlighted, as EHEC of other HUS-associated serogroups
(O157, O91, and O103) were also identified during the outbreak.
Serotyping data are rarely available, due to the need for
time-consuming techniques usually only carried out in specialised
reference labs. This shows the need for the development of rapid sero-
and pathotyping methods for all HUS-associated _E. coli_ strains.
Third, infection control in hospitalized patients with EHEC infection
needs specific consideration, as does laboratory safety in the
handling of EHEC. It is not without reason that in most countries of
the European Union EHEC is classified as a biosafety level (BSL)-3
microorganism (but no high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter is
required).

Both articles illustrate the importance of personal hygiene in
preventing secondary transmission. In general, EHEC does not behave
differently to any other organism transmitted via the fecal-oral
route, but our "preventive doors" for such organisms seem to stay wide
open. We have become used to the fact that hundreds of thousands of
Europeans have diarrhea every year and a certain lack of basic hygiene
seems to be acceptable, as usually nothing very severe happens. We
often lack time for hand hygiene as we consider it not to be of great
importance. However, diarrhea is not a normal state. We forget that
most enteropathogens are less infectious than EHEC or do not lead to
such severe disease with such social visibility. This brings us to the
biggest challenge. Circulating highly pathogenic and/or multiresistant
microorganisms can be detected at a very early stage, before large
outbreaks of disease occur.

Preventive microbiology is a basis for preventive medical advice and
decision-making to protect people from infections. In future,
European-wide coordination of preventive microbiology will be crucial
for early detection of major health threats caused by infectious
diseases. Its success will depend on our international and
interdisciplinary efforts to foster protection against infection.

This outbreak is over. Let us get prepared!
