More than 50 pronghorn have died near Gillette from the same bacteria that killed more than 75 of them last year [2019]. The outbreak is being investigated by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department in collaboration with the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory.

The deaths north of Gillette were noted beginning [15 Feb 2020] and are blamed preliminarily on _Mycoplasma bovis_. Game and Fish is monitoring the situation and has sent field personnel to the area. The department is working with Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory researchers to study the outbreak in more detail.

The source of infection of the _M. bovis_, the ability to predict the duration, and the geographic distribution of this outbreak in pronghorn are unknown at this point, the Game and Fish Department said in a press release.

Game and Fish continues to monitor for the disease across the state. With the exception of the Gillette area, this bacterium has not been reported as associated with significant mortality in other wildlife populations in Wyoming.

To date, this pathogen has not been shown to affect domestic pets like horses, dogs or cats and is not considered a human health risk.

_Mycoplasma bovis_ should not be confused with _Mycobacterium bovis_, which causes tuberculosis in cattle. They are 2 unrelated bacteria that cause very different diseases, Game and Fish officials said.

Area residents who see or find sick or dead pronghorn are encouraged to contact the local game warden, biologist or Sheridan Regional Game and Fish office at (307) 672-7418.

[Populations of another ungulate of the Rocky Mountains, the bighorn sheep, usually undergo die-offs due to pneumonia. The bighorn sheep pneumonia web of causation may have an important environmental component. In recent years, die-offs of bighorn sheep in several locations suggest that the proximate cause of these events may be a shared environmental determinant. However, recent evidence indicates that in the northwestern USA there seems to be a pathogen implicated in bighorn sheep outbreaks, _Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae_, an exotic disease agent for North America, introduced by domestic ovids. Here the pathogen implicated is _Mycoplasma bovis_, a pathogen causing respiratory disease, mastitis, and arthritis in cattle.

The pronghorn (_Antilocapra americana_) is an ungulate (artiodactyl) of western North America. For a picture of a male, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronghorn#/media/File:Antilocapra_americana.jpg. - Mod.PMB
