The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the [Hong Kong] Department of Health (DH) is today (4 Nov [2013]) investigating a confirmed case of Japanese encephalitis (JE) [virus infection] affecting a 5-year-old boy, and hence urged the public to take precautions against mosquito-transmitted diseases.

The patient, with good past health, has developed fever and shortness of breath since [25 Oct 2013]. He sought medical consultation from a private practitioner on [26 Oct 2013]and was admitted to a private hospital for high fever and convulsion on [29 Oct 2013]. He was transferred to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit of Queen Mary Hospital on [1 Nov 2013] for further management.

The patient is currently in serious condition.

His cerebrospinal fluid sample tested positive for antibodies against JE, a viral disease transmitted by the bite of infective mosquitoes, upon laboratory testing by the Public Health Laboratory Services Branch of the CHP.

Initial enquiries by the CHP revealed that the patient had travelled to Tokyo, Japan, between 11-14 Oct [2013]. His travel collaterals and home contacts have remained asymptomatic so far. The CHP's investigation is proceeding.

Apart from the above case, to date, 4 JE cases (2 local and 2 imported) have been reported to the CHP this year [2013].

In 2012, 3 cases (2 imported and one local) were reported, while one (a local case) was reported in 2011. Locally, no cases were reported from 2008 to 2010.

A CHP spokesman explained that JE is a viral disease transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes. _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ (Culicine mosquito) is the principal vector of JE and is nocturnal.

It mainly breeds in waterlogged fields, marshes, ditches and small stagnant collections of water around cultivated fields. The mosquitoes become infected by feeding on pigs and wild birds infected with the JE virus, and then transmit the virus to humans and animals during the feeding process. JE is endemic in Mainland China and Southeast Asia.

Most JE virus infections are mild without apparent symptoms other than fever with headache.

More severe infections are clinically characterised by quick onset of headache, high fever, neck stiffness, impaired mental state, coma, tremors, occasional convulsions (especially in infants) and paralysis.

To prevent contracting JE, members of the public, particularly those living in rural areas, are reminded to take heed of the following preventive measures, especially after dark:
- Wear long-sleeved clothes and trousers;
- Use effective insect repellents containing DEET over exposed parts of the body when outdoors; and
- Use mosquito screens or nets in rooms which are not air-conditioned.

Travellers to endemic areas of JE should take the following precautions:
- Avoid outdoor exposure to mosquito bites at dusk and dawn, especially in rural areas, when mosquitoes spreading this virus are most active;
- Apply effective insect repellents containing DEET over exposed parts of the body and clothes; and
- Consider vaccination that should be completed at least 10 days before departure to endemic areas in Asia or the Western Pacific for staying over one month, particularly in high-risk rural areas.

[Since the incubation period is 5-15 days, the child could have been infected with Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) either on his trip to Japan, or, more likely, at home in Hong Kong. There have been imported cases in recent years where individuals have become infected in other areas in Asia and become ill in Hong Kong. However, there have been 2 previous cases in Hong Kong this year (2013) that are positive for this virus infection (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20130723.1840352). The virus is endemic in large areas of Asia, including Japan and China. Because Hong Kong is well within the geographic distribution of JEV, it would not be surprising to see additional cases occur occasionally. Individuals living in, or traveling to, JEV endemic areas are well advised to follow the precautions listed above.
