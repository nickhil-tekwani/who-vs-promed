Ten infants have died of measles in the past 5 days, health authorities
here told Radio VOP [a Seventh-day Adventist radio broadcast and Bible
School] on Wednesday [20 Jan 2010]. Provincial medical director (PMD) Dr
Robert Mudyiradima said the 10 included mostly children from the Apostolic
Sect religion, who are against immunization. "A suspected measles outbreak
has killed 10 people in the Murwira area in Bikita, about 10 km out of
Nyika growth point. They are believed to belong to an Apostolic Sect," Dr
Mudyiradima said.

He said The Ministry of Health deployed a team of assessors on Tuesday [19
Jan 2010] to try and contain the disease. The disease is suspected to have
spread to children following a religious gathering by the apostolic sect
members' days before. The measles outbreak comes hard on the heels of
another one in Manicaland last December 2009 which claimed the lives of 22
infants [and is still unchecked; see preceding ProMED-mail post].

[These fatalities appear to be additional to those in Harare, Manicaland
and Zvishavane reported yesterday (19 Jan 2010) in ProMED-mail post
"Measles - Africa (02): Zimbabwe 20100120.0229". Again, the victims are
reputed to be unvaccinated children of members of a religious sect, and
attendance at a religious gathering has facilitated the spread of infection.
