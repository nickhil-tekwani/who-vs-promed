DNR confirms viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus in Baseline Lake and
Lake St Clair
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Natural Resources [DNR] today [20 Aug 2009]
announced that it has confirmed the presence of viral hemorrhagic
septicemia virus (VHSv) in samples of fish collected this spring
[2009] in Baseline Lake in Washtenaw County and in Lake St Clair.
Baseline Lake becomes the 2nd inland lake in Michigan in which VHSv is
present.

"These are the 1st positive detections since 2007 in Michigan's
waters," said Gary Whelan, fish production manager for the DNR's
Fisheries Division. "The fish that tested positive were collected this
spring [2009] during routine surveillance efforts, and were confirmed
positive by multiple laboratories."

After VHSv was first detected in Michigan, the DNR began a
surveillance program to collect fish from a range of waters for
testing each year. This program has been funded in part by grants from
the US Department of Agriculture-Animal Plant Health Inspection
Service (USDA-APHIS). Through June 2009, VHSv surveillance efforts
have been conducted on 45 water bodies throughout Michigan.

Baseline Lake was sampled for the 1st time in 2009, and VHSv was found
in brown bullheads that were collected during the survey. Baseline
Lake is the 2nd inland water body in Michigan in which fish have been
found to be positive for VHSv -- the 1st was Budd Lake in Clare County
in 2007. Other fish species sampled, including bluegills and rock
bass, tested negative for the virus, Whelan said.

"There was no reported fish kill in Baseline Lake associated with
these findings. These fish were simply collected as part of a routine
survey program to look for VHSv around the state," said Steve Hewett,
Lake Erie Basin coordinator for DNR's Fisheries Division. "The future
threat of this virus in Baseline Lake is not known, but we will be
more closely monitoring fish for signs of VHSv in both the lake and
adjacent waters to determine any effects of the virus."

Anglers and boaters are reminded to visit the DNR Web site at
<http://www.michigan.gov/dnrfishing> for specific ways to reduce the
risk of spreading the disease.

"Detection of VHSv in brown bullheads in Baseline Lake means that
anglers and boaters must continue to be vigilant and work
collaboratively with us to prevent the spread of this virus to other
waters. It is our opinion that their efforts to date have helped
significantly to reduce the rate of spread of this virus, and we thank
them for their efforts to date," Hewett said.

The virus was also detected in smallmouth bass and muskellunge from
Lake St Clair, which has been positive for VHSv since at least 2003.
The smallmouth bass were sampled during a fish kill in early June
[2009] in Lake St Clair, Whelan said.

"It is highly likely that VHSv played a part in the fish kill and
allowed a bacterial infection to become a disease agent by lowering
the immune system's ability to respond to the bacteria," explained
Whelan.

The muskellunge were sampled in mid-May [2009] during their spawning
period as part of the surveillance effort for Lake St Clair. No
mortality of muskellunge was observed this spring, and the last
significant mortality of muskellunge that was attributed to VHSv was
in 2006.

"This result is not surprising and means that muskellunge in Lake St
Clair are still carrying VHSv," Whelan noted.

Anglers are reminded to refrain from moving live fish between water
bodies and to use and dispose of bait and baitfish properly. Boaters
need to make sure their bilges and live wells are emptied prior to
leaving a boat launch site and equipment must be cleaned and
disinfected after use. The DNR website at
<http://www.michigan.gov/dnrfishing> also contains information for
anglers and boaters on rules that have been in place to limit the
spread of VHSv.

[Viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) virus is an extremely serious
pathogen of fresh and saltwater fish, and is causing an emerging
disease in many lakes of the United States and Canada.

VHS has been found specifically in the waters of Lake Huron, Lake St
Clair, Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, and the St Lawrence River. Due to its
high mortality and severe economic consequences, VHS is classified as
a reportable disease by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE).

The disease transmits easily between fish of all ages. Mortality is
highest at low water temperatures between 37 and 54 deg F (2.7-12.2
deg C). Some fish will show no external signs while others show signs
that include bulging eyes, bloated abdomens, inactive or hyperactive
behavior, and hemorrhaging in the eyes, skin, gills, and at the base
of the fins. Infected fish may also have lesions that look like those
caused by other fish diseases,therefore testing is necessary to
determine whether the fish is infected with VHS virus.
