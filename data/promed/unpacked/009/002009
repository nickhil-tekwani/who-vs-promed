A Case of Tick-borne Flavivirus Infection, Jeddah , Saudi Arabia
----------------------------------------------------------------
A case of tick-born flavivirus (TBF) infection was diagnosed at the
Virology Laboratory of Dr Fakeeh Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The
patient was admitted on Sun 21 Apr 2002 with fever, vomiting, epigastric
pain, diarrhoea, and hematemesis of more than 4 days duration. The patient
was ill and looked toxic. Clinical laboratory data revealed leucopenia,
thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzyme, AST, ALT.
The patient's history revealed involvement in slaughtering animals and
cutting fresh animal meat; his right hand showed a scar of a wound. This
made me suspect a zoonotic animal disease, TBF, Rift Valley fever, or
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. IgM-capture ELISA was positive only for
TBF in a first sample taken on the sixth day of illness, and in a second
sample one week later. Testing for IgG using Vero cells infected with the
prototype strain isolated in 1996 (Alkhurma virus) showed seroconversion
from non-reactive to positive 1/80. This confirms the IgM-capture ELISA.
Virus culture was attempted from the first sample on Vero cells but no
growth has been observed to date.

[Tick-borne flaviviruses responsible for hemorrhagic fever in humans have
been isolated in Siberia (Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus), India (Kyasanur
Forest disease virus, KFDV), and in Saudi Arabia (Alkhurma virus, ALKV).
ProMED-mail welcomes this report from Dr. Ali Zaki on the recurrence of
Alkhurma virus infection in Saudi Arabia. In 1997 Dr Zaki reported the
isolation of a flavivirus related to the tick-borne encephalitis complex
from the blood of 6 male butchers, aged 24-39 years, in Jeddah, Saudi
Arabia in Nov and Dec 1995 (see: Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg 1997
Mar-Apr;91(2):179-81). Of these patients, 2 died and the other 4 recovered
completely. Additionally, 4 other patients (3 males and 1 female) were
diagnosed serologically by immunoglobulin M capture enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay and seroconversion in acute and convalescent blood
samples examined by indirect immunofluorescent test using Vero cells
infected with the isolated virus.
The virus identity was confirmed at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA, by the polymerase chain reaction;
it was closely related to Kyasanur Forest disease virus and was named
Alkhurma virus. All infected patients had similar clinical and laboratory
symptoms and signs, including fever, headache, generalized body aches,
arthralgia, anorexia, vomiting, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated
liver enzymes (serum glutamic oxalacetic and serum glutamic pyruvic
transaminases), elevated creatinine phosphokinase, and elevated blood urea.
One patient developed symptoms of encephalitis, but survived without any
sequel. Skin rash developed in 2 patients, morbilliform on the hands, feet,
and lower abdomen of one patient and purpuric associated with melaena in
the second patient. Of the 10 confirmed patients, 8 were working with
sheep, and the disease was presumed to be a zoonotic viral infection.
Subsequently the complete coding sequence of the genome of Alkhurma virus
was determined by Charrel et al. (Biochem Biophys Res Commun 2001 Sep
21;287(2):455-461) and phylogenetic analysis of the tick-borne encephalitis
virus complex established that ALKV and KFDV constitute 2 genetic subtypes
of the same virus species (i.e. the species _Kyasanur Forest disease
virus_) according to current genetic criteria of classification. - Mod.CP]
