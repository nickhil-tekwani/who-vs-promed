[1] Ophthalmologic manifestations
Date: Wed 23 Mar 2022
Source: Healio News [edited]
https://www.healio.com/news/ophthalmology/20220323/ophthalmological-manifestations-observed-in-onethird-of-covid19-cases-at-single-center


Severe COVID-19 was associated with ophthalmological manifestations in more than one-3rd of patients who presented to a single center with the disease, according to a study published in Retina.

Researchers conducted a cross-sectional single-center study of consecutive patients who presented to a Mexico City ICU with COVID-19 in May and June 2020. All patients underwent fundus examination with an indirect ophthalmoscope, and photographs were taken with a posterior pole camera.

The study included 117 patients with a median age of 54 years. As many as 42 patients had ophthalmological manifestations, and 10 patients had more than one manifestation. Manifestations were unilateral in 23 patients and bilateral in 19 patients.

A total of 13 patients had papillitis, 12 had cotton wool spots, 8 had retinal nerve fiber layer edema, 5 had retinal hemorrhages, 5 had macular whitening, 4 had retinal vascular tortuosity, 3 had papillophlebitis, 1 had central retinal vein occlusion and 1 had branch retinal vein occlusion.

Factors such as demographic characteristics, inflammatory markers, hemodynamics, and comorbidities were not associated with the manifestations.

"Over one-3rd of patients with severe COVID-19 had ophthalmological manifestations," Rosa Mar√≠a Romero-Castro, MD, of the Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias in Mexico City, and colleagues wrote. "The most frequent fundoscopic findings were optic nerve inflammation, microvasculature occlusion, and major vascular occlusions. We recommend long-term follow-up to prevent permanent ocular sequelae."

[2] Omicron and "natural immunity"
Date: Thu 24 Mar 2022
Source: Ars Technica [edited]
https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/03/omicron-is-trouncing-the-argument-for-natural-immunity-to-covid/


So-called "natural immunity" against COVID-19 has always been a dodgy argument for avoiding vaccination during the pandemic. But amid omicron, natural immunity is clearly rubbish.

Unvaccinated people who recover from an omicron coronavirus variant infection are left with paltry levels of neutralizing antibodies against omicron. They also have almost no neutralizing antibodies against any of 5 other coronavirus variants, including delta. People who were vaccinated before getting an omicron infection, however, have strong protection against all 5 variants, and they have some of the highest levels of neutralizing antibodies against omicron.

That's all according to a new study surveying neutralizing antibody profiles in people who have all recovered from an omicron infection, with or without pre-existing immunity. The study was published [Wed 23 Mar 2022] in The New England Journal of Medicine by a team of Austrian researchers. The researchers were led by virologist Janine Kimpel of the Medical University of Innsbruck.

Overall, the findings highlight that omicron is "an extremely potent immune-escape variant that shows little cross-reactivity with the earlier variants," the authors conclude. As such, unvaccinated people who recovered from an omicron infection might not have protection from other variants. "For full protection, vaccination is warranted," they conclude.

The findings and conclusion are likely to rekindle discussion on the importance of "natural immunity," which is immune protection following an infection rather than vaccination.

People who oppose getting COVID-19 shots argue that their prior infections gave them equal --if not superior-- immunity to the pandemic coronavirus compared with vaccination. However, experts repeatedly noted that, while past infection can offer protection, it is not always strong and can vary widely. Some people who recover from COVID-19 have weak defenses, particularly if they had mild infections. Vaccination, meanwhile, offers relatively consistent and high-level protection. Moreover, so-called hybrid immunity --getting vaccinated after an infection-- offers some of the highest levels of protection.

Variants and vaccines
---------------------
Still, the omicron wave has been the pandemic's golden age of confirmation bias for those who oppose vaccines. The ultratransmissible coronavirus variant is perceived as milder than earlier versions, and it can thwart defenses from vaccines, leading to more breakthrough infections. To some, this conflagration makes vaccines appear both less necessary and less useful.

But omicron is not a mild virus. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 146 000 people in the US have died of COVID-19 since [1 Jan 2022], when the omicron surge was well underway. By the end of January [2022], the country saw a record high for hospitalizations, with a 7-day average of nearly 160 000 per day.

And vaccines have clearly been effective. People ages 12 and up who were vaccinated and boosted amid the omicron wave were 3.5 times less likely to test positive for COVID-19 and 21 times less likely to die of COVID-19.

The new study led by Kimpel adds further evidence for the usefulness of vaccines and their clear advantage over natural immunity. The researchers looked at neutralizing antibody levels in 4 groups of people who had recently recovered from an omicron infection: 15 vaccinated people; 18 unvaccinated people; 11 vaccinated people who had previously been infected (with wildtype, alpha, or delta variants); and 15 unvaccinated people who had been previously infected. The researchers looked at each person's neutralizing antibody levels against 6 variants: wildtype, alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and omicron.

The unvaccinated people fared the worst, producing a mean 50% neutralizing antibody titer of just 79.5 against omicron. The mean titer against omicron in vaccinated people was 680. Unvaccinated people also had low-to-negligible levels of neutralizing antibodies against the other 5 variants.

People who were in either the vaccinated group or the vaccinated-and-previously-infected group had the highest levels of protection against all 6 variants. People who were unvaccinated but had immunity from an infection prior to omicron had higher and broader protection than the unvaccinated group. However, antibody levels were more variable and lower overall than those seen in the vaccinated groups.

The study has limitations, such as the small group sizes. However, the data demonstrates that omicron infections do not provide broad immunity against coronavirus variants. It also bolsters earlier findings that past coronavirus infections don't provide the same consistent and high levels of protection as vaccination.

To the editor:
Serum samples obtained from unvaccinated persons after infection with the B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), or B.1.617.2 (delta) variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been shown to neutralize the B.1.1.529 (omicron) variant only occasionally.(1) Similarly, levels of neutralizing antibodies against the omicron variant are low and only short-lived after one or two doses of a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine but are enhanced in persons who have been vaccinated and have also been infected (i.e., those with hybrid immunity) or in vaccinated persons who have received a booster dose.(2,3)

Little is known about neutralization profiles in persons who have recovered from infection with the omicron variant.(4,5) Studies have focused primarily on either vaccinated persons who have had breakthrough infections with the omicron variant or unvaccinated persons whose history of previous infection is unknown. Here, we report the results of an analysis of neutralization profiles against 6 SARS-CoV-2 variants in serum samples obtained from persons who had recovered from infection with the omicron BA.1 variant, with or without preexisting SARS-CoV-2 immunity. ...-more

We found that neutralizing antibody titers against all the variants were high among vaccinated persons after omicron BA.1 breakthrough infection and among vaccinated or unvaccinated persons who had had previous infection with the wild-type, alpha, or delta variant before infection with the omicron BA.1 variant (Figure 1, Fig. S2, and Table S6). Mean neutralizing antibody titers against the omicron BA.1 variant were lower than those against the other variants among previously vaccinated persons but were similar to those against the other variants among unvaccinated persons who had had infection with the wild-type, alpha, or delta variant before infection with the omicron BA.1 variant. In contrast, samples obtained from unvaccinated persons who had not had previous SARS-CoV-2 infection before infection with the omicron BA.1 variant contained mainly neutralizing antibodies against omicron BA.1 but only occasionally contained neutralizing antibodies against the other variants. It is surprising that 2 unvaccinated persons who were thought to have been reinfected had neutralizing antibodies against only the omicron BA.1 variant and 1 unvaccinated person had no neutralizing antibodies against any variant, despite the fact that each of the 3 persons had a reported single previous positive PCR assay for the delta variant 2 months before reinfection (Figure 1D). Because serum samples obtained from these persons did not neutralize the delta variant nor any of the other variants except for omicron BA.1, it is possible that the previous PCR assay had yielded a false-positive result.

Despite certain limitations of this study, including the small sample size and retrospective study design (Table S7), our data support the hypothesis that the omicron BA.1 variant is an extremely potent immune-escape variant that shows little cross-reactivity with the earlier variants. Therefore, unvaccinated persons who are infected with the omicron BA.1 variant only (without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection) might not be sufficiently protected against infection with a SARS-CoV-2 variant other than omicron BA.1; for full protection, vaccination is warranted.

[3] Contact tracing
Date: Mon 28 Mar 2022

A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) modeling study used data from 59 US case investigation and contact tracing (CICT) programs to estimate that the programs prevented 1.11 -- 1.36 million COVID-19 cases, and 27 000 to 34 000 hospitalizations over 60 days in winter 2020-21, well before the delta and omicron variant surges.

The researchers collected data from 25 Nov 2020 -- 23 Jan 2021, for analysis from July to September 2021. The 22 states and 1 territory studied covered 42.5% of the US population, spanned all 4 US Census regions, and reported data that reflected all 59 federally funded CICT programs.

Under a high-impact scenario in which 80% of all interviewed COVID-19 survivors and monitored contacts, as well as 30% of notified contacts, complied 100% with quarantine recommendations, CICT programs prevented 1.11 million infections and 27 231 hospitalizations.

In a low-impact scenario in which all COVID-19 survivors and monitored contacts followed quarantine guidelines, those estimates rose to 1.36 million infections and 33 527 hospitalizations.

Across all scenarios and jurisdictions, CICT prevented an estimated median of 21.2% (range, 1.3% -- 65.8%) of infections not averted by vaccination and nonpharmaceutical interventions. CICT jurisdictions in the Midwest averted the most cases (1444 to 1600 cases per 100 000 people in low- and high-impact scenarios, respectively), while those in the West averted the fewest (488 to 568 cases per 100‚ÄØ000 in the low- and high-impact scenarios).

In February 2022, the study authors had previously assessed data from 5 US states and 9 local health districts to estimate that CICT programs lowered SARS-CoV-2 spread by 0.4% to 32%. But, they noted, some experts said the value of such programs is limited owing to the difficulty in scaling up services during COVID-19 case surges and community members hesitancy to participate in CICT, precluding meaningful engagement between health departments and patients and their contacts.

However, the findings of the current study, the authors said, suggest that CICT programs helped contain the virus spread during the study period. "Differences in outcomes across jurisdictions indicate an opportunity to further improve CICT effectiveness," they wrote. "These estimates demonstrate the potential benefits from sustaining and improving these programs."

Conclusions
Our analysis combined primary implementation data with mathematical modeling to estimate the health outcomes of COVID-19 CICT programs across nearly one-half of US states and territories. The volume of estimated cases and hospitalizations averted underscores the critical role CICT programs could play in curtailing the pandemic, whereas differences among jurisdictions illustrate the opportunities to further improve effectiveness. Case investigation and contact tracing remain CDC-recommended practices for personally communicating individualized prevention activities against COVID-19. This work quantifies for public health decision-makers the benefits of sustaining and improving these programs. - Mod.LK]

[4] 2nd booster
Date: Fri 25 Mar 2022
Source: New York Times [abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/25/us/politics/biden-second-booster-shot-older-americans.html


After fraught discussions, officials decided that another shot might save thousands of lives if a new coronavirus wave hit before the fall. The F.D.A. could authorize the boosters next week.

The Biden administration is planning to give Americans age 50 or older the option of a 2nd booster of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna coronavirus vaccine without recommending outright that they get one, according to several people familiar with the plan.

Major uncertainties have complicated the decision, including how long the protection from a 2nd booster would last, how to explain the plan to the public and even whether the overall goal is to shield Americans from severe disease or from less serious infections as well, since they could lead to long COVID-19.

Much depends on when the next wave of COVID-19 infections will hit, and how hard. Should the nation be hit by a virulent surge in the next few months, offering a 2nd booster now for older Americans could arguably save thousands of lives and prevent tens of thousands of hospitalizations.

But if no major wave hits until the fall, extra shots now could turn out to be a questionable intervention that wastes vaccine doses, deepens vaccination fatigue, and sows doubt about the government's strategy. The highly contagious omicron subvariant BA.2 is helping to drive another surge of coronavirus cases in Europe and is responsible for about a 3rd of new cases in the United States, but health officials have said they do not anticipate a major surge caused by the subvariant.

Federal health officials have hotly debated the way forward, with some strongly in favor of a 2nd booster now and others skeptical. But they have apparently coalesced around a plan to give everyone age 50 and up the option of an additional shot in case infections surge again before the fall. In the fall, officials say, Americans of all ages, including anyone who gets a booster this spring, should get another shot.

The Food and Drug Administration could authorize a 2nd booster early next week, according to multiple people familiar with the deliberations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would then follow with its own advice.

Already, one in 75 Americans 65 or older has died of COVID-19, making up 3-4ths of the nation's deaths from the virus, according to the CDC's data. More than 33 million people in that age group, or more than 2-3ds, have received a 1st booster and would be eligible for a 2nd.

For some officials, the bottom-line question is this: How much must effectiveness against hospitalization drop before a 2nd booster is justified?

As it was in the fall, when boosters were first rolled out, the broader scientific community is divided over what to do. "I am not persuaded there is a substantial waning of protection against severe disease after the 3rd dose," Dr. Philip Krause, a former senior regulator at the FDA, said in an interview.

[In the past 24 hours, 21 countries including South Korea (347 374), Germany (214 035), the UK (214 392), Australia (74 999), Spain (72 892), Austria (49 071), Japan (43 565), USA (35 966), Switzerland (34 184), Italy (31 560), France (29 455), Greece (27 489), Thailand (21 678), Netherlands (21 511), Russia (21 101), Ireland (19 932), New Zealand (17 211), Finland (14 764), Turkey (14 364), Malaysia (13 336), and Israel (11 967) reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 3590 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 26 Mar 2022 to late 27 Mar 2022).

A total of 44 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 24 of the 60 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 2 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 8 are from the Western Pacific region, 3 from the South East Asia region, and none from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 12.6%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 22.1%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 9.2% decrease in daily reported cases and a 30.7% decrease in reported deaths. An overall global trend of decreasing cases with an increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 1.36 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 483.47 million cumulative reported cases and over 6.15 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
