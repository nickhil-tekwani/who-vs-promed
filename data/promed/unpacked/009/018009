Eight districts in Kagera Region have confirmed to have been hit by
the destructive banana xanthomonas wilt (BXW). Almost 90 percent of
the entire crop is at risk of destruction. Kagera has an annual yield
of about 650 000 tonnes of banana in a community of about 2.2 million
people.

The situation has caused panic among farmers and residents who depend
on banana as their main staple and cash crop. Mugenzi Byabachwezi,
Maruku Agricultural Research Institute (ARI), said, "Other banana
growing regions include Arusha, Mbeya, and Kilimanjaro where BXW has
not been reported yet, should now streamline surveillance."

He said BXW has now spread to Eastern Africa and the Great Lakes
Region. Kenya, Tanzania, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Burundi,
Uganda, Rwanda, [Ethiopia], and Zambia have either reported the
presence of BXW or are at high risk of contracting it from a
neighbour. Joint effort is needed from all stakeholders to control
spread of the disease.

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) says that as well as BXW
and banana bunchy top disease -- which threaten the food security of
70 million people in sub-Saharan African -- black leaf streak and
fusarium wilt (also known as Panama disease) are spreading at an
alarming rate.

[_Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _musacearum_ is the causal organism of
banana bacterial wilt in central Africa (BXW; bacterial wilts due to
_Ralstonia_ species are present elsewhere). It affects all banana
types causing wilting and premature ripening of fruit. An incidence
of 70-80 percent in many plantations and yield losses of up to 90
percent have been reported.

The bacteria survive in soil and plant debris and are mainly spread
via infected planting material, by insects, mechanical means, and
contaminated tools. A range of alternate hosts may serve as pathogen
reservoirs. An integrated approach is needed for disease management,
including cultural methods (such as crop rotation), use of certified
clean material for replanting, as well as phytosanitation to reduce
inoculum and prevent re-introduction and plant-to-plant spread of the
pathogen.

In Tanzania, BXW was first reported in the Kagera region in 2007
(ProMED-mail post 20070418.1277) and has been spreading since then.

The other diseases mentioned are _Banana bunchy top virus_ (BBTV;
genus _Babuvirus_), black sigatoka (also known as black leaf streak,
caused by the fungus _Mycosphaerella fijiensis_) and Panama disease
(caused by the fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _cubense_). For more
information on these diseases see previous ProMED-mail posts in the
archives.
