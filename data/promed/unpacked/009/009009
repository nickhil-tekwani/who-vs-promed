Surge in Measles cases in Sussex
----------------------------
There are more and more children suffering from measles in Sussex. So far this year, there have been 180 confirmed cases amongst children and adults in Brighton alone. Compare that with 86 in the rest of East Sussex, 38 in West Sussex, 21 in Kent , and in Essex just 6.

There has been 1 case in Oxfordshire, 5 in Berkshire and 9 in Surrey. There have been none in Buckinghamshire, Hampshire or the Isle of Wight.

The statistics are being blamed on the poor take-up of the MMR vaccine

Measles outbreak: Six children die in Mohmand
----------------------------------------
PESHAWAR: Locals claim an outbreak of measles in Ambar tehsil of Mohmand Agency has killed six children. Officials confirmed the death of two of the children, but said they died because of an unconfirmed disease. [A tehsil is a city or town that has fiscal and administrative power over the villages and municipalities within its jurisdiction. - Mod.CP]

Local Qari Ali Gul told The Express Tribune on Saturday [28 Jul 2012] that the disease has struck the areas of Gumbati, Shaji Kor, Soor Tangi, Bakhmal Shah, Musa Kor and Khairo Kor, and has affected a large number of tribesmen. Another local, Mushtaq Khan, said that affected children were taken to Khar Hospital in Bajaur Agency. They said that the residents [asked] the agency surgeon to send inoculation teams to control the spread of the disease. They also urged the government to send mobile vaccination teams and said the situation may become uncontrollable if prompt action was not taken.

Mohmand Agency Officer, Dr Shabeer, denied the spread of the disease [had resulted in] the deaths. "Two deaths have been reported in Ambar and Utmanzai but by an unknown disease, we cannot confirm they were caused by measles," he said. He added that the areas further away lack qualified doctors and people depend on unqualified doctors. "The scarcity of proper health facilities worsens the situation in these circumstances," he said.

He claimed the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) Child Heath Project had worked in three community health centres, one in Daravo, one in Had Kor and one in Shati Meena. Ambar is a tehsil of the agency bordering Bajaur Agency. The area lacks basic amenities regularly, and has only one high and middle school with most residents going to schools in Charsadda.

In June, 211 children with symptoms of measles were brought to the Lady Reading Hospital (LRH) Peshawar from different areas of K-P [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa] and FATA. Hospital data revealed that a total of 989 cases of measles were brought to the LRH over the past six months, of which 884 were discharged and 44 had died. Nine patients left the hospital against doctors' advice.

A study conducted by Dr Majid Khan and Dr Tariq Anwar at LRH from 01 Nov 2011, to 22 May of this year, revealed that the measles outbreak in K-P and FATA was a result of poor vaccination campaigns, military conflict, migration and malnutrition in the area. Talking to The Express Tribune, Dr Khan explained that measles was an infectious viral disease that could easily spread through migrating people, especially if they have a weak immunity due to inadequate food intake. He said the hospital has received children as young as four months suffering from measles. Khan explained that children younger than nine months usually do not get measles as they have antibodies transmitted from their mothers during pregnancy. This shows that the mothers did not receive proper nutrition.

Measles is highly contagious and spread by a virus that is easily prevented by proper immunisation but can be fatal. It caused nearly 140 000 deaths worldwide in 2010, according to the World Health Organisation - 95% in low income countries with poor health infrastructure.

Moves to contain measles outbreak
------------------------------
Measles is spreading through the Campbelltown area after first appearing in Eagle Vale last month. South Western Sydney Local Health District director of public health Stephen Conaty said there had been at least 22 local cases of measles since the beginning of June and the disease had now spread to suburbs around Eagle Vale. "Measles is very infectious and so it's possible that we could see a huge outbreak," Dr Conaty told the Advertiser. He said the disease was not common in Australia and could have been brought to Sydney by someone who had travelled overseas. "All the cases of measles that we see are really imported from elsewhere, and we can see some local transmission after that," Dr Conaty said.

Those born since 1966 who have not had two doses of the MMR vaccine, or a previous measles infection, are considered most susceptible. The majority of people who have been diagnosed locally have been teenagers and young children that had not been immunised, including five infants. "What's really important is that people are aware of the symptoms -- a cough, running nose and then a rash that follows [a few days later]," Dr Conaty said. He said people should see a doctor if they had these symptoms, but should call and notify the doctor's surgery before arriving to avoid spreading the virus. For young children, the MMR vaccination is recommended at 12 months and again at four years of age.
