400 families in the interior of Ba have been affected by an outbreak of communicable diseases [hepatitis A and leptospirosis] that stemmed from a [contaminated] water source. Prime Minister Commodore Voreqe Bainimarama confirmed this during a visit to the affected water source yesterday [15 Nov 2013]. So far, 12 confirmed cases of hepatitis A and 23 cases of leptospirosis have been reported by health authorities.

Commodore Bainimarama led a government delegation consisting of WAF, district officers, medical and police officials. He was also briefed by a team of health officials who have been monitoring the area since the 1st suspected cases were reported earlier this week. Ba health officials revealed that the dam owned by Ba company MR Dayal and Sons was alleged to have been contaminated by nearby farmlands and animals that freely roam the unprotected water source.

Areas affected include Nukuloa, Tabataba, Moto, Nacaci, Balevuto, and Vatusui. Also located within these areas are 4 schools that also depend on the water source. Concerned for the residents that have now been without water since the Waica dam was shut down earlier this week by health officials, the Prime Minister ordered immediate action to be taken by authorities. He said the government could not afford to leave residents without water or with a contaminated water supply.

Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama has ordered authorities to improve the quality of water for hundreds of families in a part of Ba where cases of leptospirosis and hepatitis A were reported. The emergency operation at Nukuloa is expected to continue, and water will be carted to affected families for a while.

Bainimarama visited the dam to see the problem firsthand: "The water needs to go to everybody. They don't want water that provides them only 5 hours of when they want water. They want 24 hours of drinking water like everybody else."

The emergency situation has already cost FJD 20 000 [USD 10 730] and it will cost the government FJD 400 000 [USD 214 720] to deliver clean and safe water to the families. Water Authority of Fiji Chief Operating officer Laxman Attanyake says they will help improve conditions at the dam. "That has to be done in 3 months; that is the directive from the Prime Minister, and the Water Authority is determined to accomplish that task in within 3 months."

More than 80 suspected cases of water-borne diseases were reported in the last fortnight. The owner of the private water source says they are not responsible for the outbreak of diseases. "I don't think so. We should not be held responsible for all this, because we don't know the cause. The Health Ministry is saying it, but we don't' know. The water supply system has been there for the last 56 years."

Bainimarama wants a permanent solution, and the government is looking at constructing a dam in the mountains near the area.

[The above articles say that Fiji authorities have implicated contamination of a community's water source to account for an outbreak of leptospirosis and hepatitis A in the community. The 1st article says that the water was contaminated from runoff of nearby farmlands and from animals that freely roam the unprotected water source. The articles, however, fail to say how this was established. Was fecal contamination of the water supply determined? Were hepatitis A virus and _Leptospira_ specifically identified at some point in the community's water supply?

Leptospirosis is transmitted to humans by exposure to soil or fresh water contaminated with the urine of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rodents) that are chronically infected with pathogenic _Leptospira_. Humans, however, rarely become chronic carriers. _Leptospira_ may survive in contaminated fresh water or moist soil for weeks to months. Outbreaks of leptospirosis in Fiji frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers.

Hepatitis A also is transmitted to previously uninfected (and unvaccinated) persons by ingestion of contaminated food or water, as well as by person-to-person contact, primarily by the fecal-oral route. In contrast to leptospirosis, only humans and non-human primates become infected with hepatitis A, and hepatitis A has no carrier state. From my brief search on the Internet, there are no non-human primates on Fiji, which suggests that if the water supply is the source, hepatitis A virus is being shed in feces from active cases of hepatitis A in the community, and that there is human sewerage contaminating the water source.

In addition to improved sanitation, ensuring a supply of safe drinking water, and food safety, immunization against hepatitis A has been used successfully to control community-wide outbreaks (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs328/en/). The CDC recommends, after exposure to hepatitis A virus, a single dose of hepatitis A vaccine or serum immunoglobulin (IG) (0.02 mL/kg) be given as soon as possible, within 2 weeks after contact with the virus to unvaccinated persons aged 1-40 years (http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hav/havfaq.htm). For persons aged 40 years and older and for children aged less than 12 months, IG is given, and IG should also be used in immunocompromised persons, persons with chronic liver disease, and persons who are allergic to the vaccine or a vaccine component. Hepatitis A vaccine should also be optimally included in the routine series of childhood immunizations.

Ba is a town in the province of the same name that occupies the northwestern sector of Viti Levu, Fiji's largest island. Fiji is an island nation in Melanesia in the South Pacific Ocean, about 2000 km (1300 miles) northeast of New Zealand's North Island (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiji). Fiji is divided into 4 major divisions: Central, Eastern, Northern, and Western. For a map of Fiji's divisions, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fiji_divisions_named.png.
