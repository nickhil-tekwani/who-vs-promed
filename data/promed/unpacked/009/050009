State agriculture officials say they're seeing an outbreak of a
mosquito-borne disease that can kill horses.

Last year [2007], the state saw 18 cases of eastern equine
encephalitis [EEE]. There have been 9 cases already this year [2008].
The season typically starts in May.

Florida Agriculture Commissioner Charles Bronson warns that horses
should be vaccinated to protect them against the disease and the West
Nile virus.

Eastern equine encephalitis is a viral disease transmitted to horses
[and humans] by mosquitoes. Signs of the virus include fever,
listlessness, stumbling, circling, coma and, in 90 percent of cases,
death.

Volusia County has been hardest hit so far this year [2008], with 4
of the 9 cases.

[This is an early start to the EEE season, although there can be
year-round transmission of the virus in Florida during mild winters.
Disease in horses is entirely preventable by routine vaccination. Why
horse owners neglect to vaccinate their animals in this well
recognized endemic EEE virus transmission area is bewildering. -

The finding of EEE virus in horses and/or mosquitoes is often a
prelude to human cases. The reservoir is wild birds of species that
nest in swamps. People who live near the Florida swamps should
already begin taking anti-mosquito precautions. There is no publicly
available human vaccine, and the disease is pretty nasty, causing
encephalitis that can kill small children and old people. - Mod.JW
