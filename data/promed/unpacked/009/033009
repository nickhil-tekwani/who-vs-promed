A large number of cases of brucellosis among
animals has been registered in the
Bogdanovicheskiy district [Sverdlovsk region]:
A significant outbreak of brucellosis among
animals has been registered in the
Bogdanovicheskiy district of Sverdlovsk region.
[An entire] herd of sheep became ill with
brucellosis on a dairy commodity farm in the
village of Prishchanovo. Health officers
indicated that animals have been imported without
the necessary documentation. Veterinary
inspection experts from the city of Bogdanovich
indicated that only a some of sheep got sick with
brucellosis, but it was necessary to destroy all animals kept on the farm.
It has been more than 20 years since large
numbers of cases of brucellosis have been found
among animals in the district and therefore
veterinarians mentioned that the incident is significant.
The wooden facilities where the sheep were
contained will be disassembled, and the farm will
be disinfected. Animals will be directed to a
meat-packing plant in Ekaterinburg. Sick sheep,
according to the order of veterinarians, should
be destroyed before 24 May [2007].
Veterinarians have noted that it is safe to
consume meat from animals that were diagnosed
with brucellosis, as long as proper manufacturing
and processing methods are followed for sausage products and canned food.

[The Sverdlovsk region is located between the
Central and Northern Urals adjoining the Siberian
plain. The total area is 194 000 square
kilometers, and the population is 4.4 million.
Ekaterinburg, the administrative center of
Sverdlovsk region, is located 1667 km east of
Moscow on the border between Europe and Asia. - Mod.NP]

[The newswire mentions that it is safe to use
meat taken from an animal with brucellosis as
long as proper processing procedures are
followed. One does wonder about the prudence of
such a recommendation given the local
setting. According to the FAO Animal Health
Disease Card on bovine brucellosis (available at:
<http://www.fao.org/AG/AGAINFO/SUBJECTS/en/health/diseases-cards/brucellosi-bo.html>):
"Brucellosis known as 'Malta fever' or 'undulant
fever' are synonyms for brucellosis in man
(Ansorg et al., 1983). Symptoms of acute
brucellosis caused by Brucella abortus are
'flu-like' and highly nonspecific. Chronic
brucellosis is an insidious disease with vague
symptoms that might be confused with other
diseases affecting various organ systems (Yinnon
et al., 1993). Humans usually acquire brucellosis
by consumption of raw milk or milk products.
Brucellosis is also recognized as an occupational
hazard for farmers, veterinarians, and workers in
the meat industry within areas with enzootic _B.
abortus_. Farmers and workers in the meat
industry may contract brucellosis percutaneous,
conjunctival or by nasal mucous membrane
infection. Veterinarians may become infected when
handling aborted foetuses or apparently healthy
calves born to infected cows and by performing
gynaecological and obstetric manipulations, or
rectal examination of infected cattle
(Schnurrenberger et al., 1975; Dekeijzer, 1981; Peelman and Dekeyser ,1987)."
