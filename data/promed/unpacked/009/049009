Viet Nam: another human case of avian influenza virus confirmed in Thai Binh
-----------------------------------------------
A 36 year old man from Viet Nam's northern Thai Binh province has just been
confirmed to be infected with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus, raising the
number of infections in the country to 19 since December 2004. Testing
conducted on Sat 26 Feb 2005 showed that samples from the man from Vu Thu
district [of Thai Binh province] had tested positive for the virus, the
local newspaper Saigon Liberation reported on Sun 27 Feb 2005.
The patient is now receiving treatment at the Tropical Disease Institute in
Hanoi, which is also treating a 21 year old man from the province's Thai
Thuy district for H5N1 virus infection. The 21 year old, who needs
respiratory assistance, ate goose meat before exhibiting bird flu symptoms,
said a local doctor.
In the most recent outbreak, starting from 16 Dec 2004, Viet Nam has
identified 19 local people who have contracted avian influenza A (H5N1)
virus infection, 12 of whom have died. Avian influenza, which has killed
and led to the forced culling of more than 1.5 million fowl in 35 cities
and provinces in the country since January 2005, is cooling down. By Sat 26
Feb 2005, 14 out of 35 localities had detected no new bird flu-affected
sites for at least 3 weeks, according to the Vietnamese Department of
Animal Health.
