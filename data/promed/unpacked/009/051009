The 19-year-old university student diagnosed with [a] hantavirus
[infection] has undergone a satisfactory evolution in his state of
health. The infected person was disconnected from a respirator and
has no renal function damage, so recuperation is expected soon.

SEREMI [The Department of Public Health and Health Planning]
initiated a health summary to verify where the infection was acquired.

[The previous report of this case (see ProMED archive no.
20100209.0448) indicated that the young man is 21 years old, yet this
report indicated 19 years, but the name of the patient is the same,
confirming that this is a subsequent report on the progress of this
patient. The scant clinical information provided by this report
points to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. A 10 Feb 2010 report from
Radio Bio Bio
(<http://www.radiobiobio.cl/2010/02/10/confirman-segundo-caso-de-virus-hanta-en-la-araucania/>)
indicated that a rapid diagnostic test was positive for a hantavirus.
The etiological agent in this case is most likely Andes virus.
