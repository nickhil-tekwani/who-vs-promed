Malaria kills 200 in western Kenya
-------------------
NAIROBI - A malaria epidemic in Kenya's western and Rift Valley regions has
killed more than 200 people during the past 2 weeks and thousands of others
are suffering from the disease, a senior health ministry official said on
Monday. "There has been a massive death toll along Kenya's malaria belts in
Nyanza and parts of Rift Valley provinces in the past 2 weeks but the
government has intervened to offer free medical services," Director of
Medical Services Richard Muga told AFP.
Muga said the government would deliver free drugs to hospitals in the
affected areas: Keiyo, Nakuru, Kisii, Kericho, and Nandi districts. "The
long rains that have been pounding the western region of the country and
high temperatures that followed are to blame for the upsurge in the spread
of highland malaria infections," said Muga.

Malaria outbreak in Rift Valey and Nyanza Province
-----------------------------------
Hospitals in Kenya's Rift Valley and Nyanza provinces are on emergency
alert as the death toll from a malaria epidemic tops 200. The outbreak of
highland malaria has affected thousands of people in western areas of the
country, according to the acting provincial medical health officer, John
Kibusio, speaking in Nakuru on Monday. The government has responded by
announcing that treatment for the disease will be given free at state-run
hospitals. Highland malaria is defined by scientists as malaria that occurs
at the high altitude limit for the disease.
Outbreaks of the disease show a fluctuating pattern, Dr Jon Cox of the
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine told BBC News Online. During
the last 5 years there have been a number of outbreaks of malaria in
highland areas of Kenya, Burundi, and Uganda. Most of the deaths have
occurred in Rift Valley and Nyanza provinces. Worst affected have been the
districts of Kericho, Londiani, Nandi, and Kapsabet. Over 5000 people have
been treated in hospital in the 2 provinces after being infected with the
disease.
Kenya's director of medical services, Dr Richard Muga, has toured Kericho's
worst-affected areas and promised free treatment and free laboratory tests
to determine who is suffering from malaria. He also said that action should
be taken to crack down on "illegal clinics" and "quacks" who were not
following health ministry guidelines, according to the Daily Nation on
Monday. Outbreaks of highland malaria in Africa occur mainly in East Africa
and, while having no clear pattern, tend to occur every 4 to 7 years. There
is considerable debate over the causes of the epidemics. The incidence of
the disease at higher altitudes is determined generally by temperature.
Dr Jon Cox says "the jury is still out" on whether climate change is a
factor in epidemics. He says other possible factors are deforestation,
changes in land and water use. The reason, he says, that high numbers of
deaths result from outbreaks is that malaria is not present permanently in
highland regions and so people build up little resistance. It is also
thought that high death rates can be caused by growing resistance of the
disease to commonly used drugs.

[The outbreak is large and widespread and will inevitably will be mainly
highland, as it won't show up in the endemic lower areas, where there
already is a lot of malaria. It is uncertain whether the current outbreak
is due to global warming. Drug resistance (chloroquine and sulfadoxine /
pyrimethamin) and poor control measures are probably also important
contributing factors. Â­ Mod.EP]
