Following the outbreak of a mysterious disease at Shakok village at Phungyar block, hundreds of fowl have perished.

In a telephone conversation, one of the villagers said that hundreds of village chickens have died, adding that the disease seems to attack fully grown chickens.

During the day, the chickens look healthy with no symptoms of any illness, but the next morning, they are found dead beneath the shed, which is usually built atop trees in the courtyard.

The chickens started dying from 1 Nov 2017, the villager said, and added that anywhere between 10 and 15 chickens are found dead every morning at the village.

On dissecting the dead chickens, villagers found that the livers of the dead chickens are usually yellowish, while the gizzards are found to be stone hard.

Reportedly, a similar disease has started to spread to neighbouring villages, such as Leiting, Phaklang and Leishi, etc.

The villagers are in despair as they have no means to control the fast spreading fowl disease.

[Sudden deaths in poultry may be due to various etiological causes, infectious or otherwise. Hopefully, veterinarians are being consulted to tackle the described event, check the anamnestic information (e.g. deaths occurring only during night?!), perform PM examinations, and collect samples for laboratory tests. Excluding a zoonotic background is one of the issues of particular importance. Results of the investigations are anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS
