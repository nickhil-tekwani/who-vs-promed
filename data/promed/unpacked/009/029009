Plague has been recorded in the Volgograd and Astrakhan regions of
the Southern Federal District of Russia. Sick rodents were found in
several [parts] of these regions.
According to experts, rats and mice have been infected by plague;
humans are at risk of being infected by pets [which have killed
infected rodents]. The experts expect a hazardous situation to
develop. Vaccination of the population at risk is being applied.
It has been postulated that unusually warm winter weather has
contributed to the development of the outbreak.
The control activities undertaken include poisoning of rats and mice.
The effect of these measures is not yet clear, since there is
movement of mice to open areas where food, namely winter wheat, is
available. It is practically impossible to carry out effective
control in outdoor conditions.

[According to
<http://www.5-tv.ru/news/print.php?newsId=2116>,
sick rodents have been found in the Limanskiy district of the
Astrakhan region, which borders Kalmykia. Cases of plague are
registered in the Volgograd region, close to the regional centre
[Volgograd] Kalachaebskiy and Svetlojarskiy districts.
In the Russian Federation, natural foci of plague in rodents have
been recorded [historically] in several regions, namely the republics
of Chechnya, Kabardino-Balkaria, Karachaevo-Cherkessia, Kalmykia and
Dagestan, and the regions Stavropol and Astrakhan, all located in the
South Federal District of Russia. Cases have also been observed in
the republics of Tyva and Gorniy Altay.
Since 1984, no plague cases have been recorded in humans in Russia. See
<http://biology.krc.karelia.ru/misc/atl/ra56g.htm>.
However, abnormally warm weather and a sharp increase in the rodent
population enhance the danger of an epidemic in pets and humans in
many regions of the country. - Mod.NP]
