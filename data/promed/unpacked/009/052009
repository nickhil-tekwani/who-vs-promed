A suspected zoonotic SARS-CoV-2 transmission from a cat to a human
------------------------------------------------------------------
In a recent study published in Emerging Infectious Diseases, researchers investigated a suspected cat-to-human transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is causally linked to a live animal market in Wuhan, China, lending the infection a zoonotic origin. America, Europe, Asia, and Africa have reported several cases reporting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 among various species, including cats, dogs, minks, lions, and tigers.

Case report
-----------
In the present study, researchers characterized a suspected case of zoonotic transmission of COVID-19 from a cat to a human.

On 15 Aug 2021, patient A visited the hospital of Prince of Songkla University in Hatyai District, Songkhla Province. The patient was a 32-year-old healthy female veterinarian with a history of clear nasal discharge, fever, and productive cough for 2 days. Physical examination included a chest radiograph and was mostly unremarkable. The patient reported 5 days earlier [10 Aug 2021], she and patients E and F, also veterinarians, had examined a cat belonging to 2 men, named patients B and C.

Patients B and C were son and father aged 32 and 64 years old, respectively, who lived in Bangkok, Thailand. A day prior, they tested positive for COVID-19 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and were transferred to the Prince of Songkla University hospital. Patients B and C, along with their cat, were transported via an ambulance on a 20-hour drive on 8 Aug 2021. The patients were then admitted to an isolation ward.

The cat was sent to the university veterinary hospital and was examined by patient A on 10 Aug 2021. The cat was found to be medically normal. Subsequently, patient A collected rectal and nasal swabs from the animal while patients E and F restrained it. When the nasal specimen was collected, the sedated cat sneezed on patient A. The 3 veterinarians were equipped with gloves and N95 respirator masks but were not wearing eye goggles or face shields during the swabbing.

Three days after exposure to the cat, patient A displayed symptoms but did not consult any medical care until 15 Aug 2021, when the cat tested RT-PCR positive for COVID-19. The nasopharyngeal swab samples collected from patient A also had SARS-CoV-2. Patients A, B, and C and the cat were isolated in the hospital. Patients E and F tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.

The team found the genomes of the cat and patients B and C were identical to those collected from patient A. This indicated the SARS-CoV-2 infections were epidemiologically related. Since patient A had no history of contact with patients B and C, she most likely acquired the virus from the cat when it sneezed on her.

Furthermore, the comparatively low RT-PCR cycle thresholds found in the nasal swabs obtained from the cat indicated the viral load was significantly high as well as infectious. Since patient A was wearing a mask but no goggles or face shield at the time of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, her exposed ocular surface was susceptible to acquiring infectious droplets from the cat.

Conclusion
----------
The study provided evidence SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from cats to humans. The researchers believe even though the odds of such a transmission are low due to the short duration of viral shedding in cats, individuals with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection must limit exposure to their cats.

[What is unclear in this report is did the father and son have SARS-CoV-2 infection and passed the infection to the cat? I suspect this is true.

While this appears to be the 1st zoonotic transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 infection from a cat to a human, it is unclear how long the cat may have been infected. If there was a high viral load from the co-caregivers, the cat may have received a high viral load from its human caregivers. The cat sneezing with the veterinarian in close proximity may have been what allowed the virus to enter the human being. While this is an interesting case, it by no means is a method of casual transmission from pet to human.

A zoonotic transmission of a disease/illness is from an animal to a human. However, in this case, it may have been 1st a case of reverse zoonosis. Meaning the men may have transmitted the disease to the cat, which is known as reverse zoonosis. Reverse zoonosis, known as zooanthroponosis, and occasionally as anthroponosis (Greek zoon "animal", anthropos "man", nosos "disease"), refers to pathogens reservoired in humans which are capable of being transmitted to non-human animals. Once the cat had the disease it was zoonotic transmission back to the veterinarian.

We hope all involved, including the cat, have recovered. - Mod.TG
