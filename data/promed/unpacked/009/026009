Microbe in Salon Footbath Is Suspected in Boil Outbreak
-------------------------------------------------------
A trip to the nail salon had far from beautiful results for at least
110 customers at a California establishment, government health
officials reported today. The customers, all but one of them women,
developed boils and skin ulcers, apparently from a microbe growing in
a footbath used for pedicures.
The boils typically developed anywhere from 10 days to 4 months after
a pedicure in the salon, and numbered as many as 37 in one woman, said
Dr. Kevin L. Winthrop, an epidemiologist who led the investigation of
the outbreak that occurred in Watsonville last fall. The boils were
often initially mistaken for insect bites.
The infection, caused by a fast-growing microbial cousin of the
tuberculosis bacterium, left some of the customers taking antibiotics
for months, and even that did not always clear the infection, Dr.
Winthrop told a scientific meeting at the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. Some women suffered scarring or have needed skin
grafts, and estimated medical costs for some have exceeded $10 000.
Dr. Winthrop said spot checks of other nail salons elsewhere in
California showed that the microbe was present in the vast majority of
footbaths. Although only one nail salon customer outside Watsonville,
a San Diego woman, is known to have been infected with the microbe,
Dr. Winthrop and Dr. Ben Werner of the California health department
said they strongly suspected that other outbreaks would occur.
Identification of the microbe, _Mycobacterium fortuitum_, usually
requires a minor surgical procedure known as a punch biopsy of the
skin. Then the treating doctor must instruct a laboratory to use the
type of culture media on which the organisms grow. Otherwise, proper
identification of the bacterium may not be made.
Dr. Winthrop said his team discovered whirlpool footbaths used in
pedicures were teeming with _M. fortuitum_. By summer, Dr. Winthrop
said, California officials are expected to issue regulations for
rigorous cleaning and disinfection of footbaths in nail salons. Nail
care is a $6 billion industry in the United States, Dr. Winthrop said,
and the more than 7500 salons in California employ some 80 000 nail
technicians.
_M. fortuitum_ and its bacteriological cousins are often found in
potable water and are ubiquitous elsewhere in the environment.
Although the microbe has occasionally caused infections among patients
with traumatic injuries, the Watsonville outbreak was the first spread
in a community, Dr. Winthrop told the 50th annual meeting of the
Epidemic Intelligence Service at the CDC.
The outbreak was discovered when a dermatologist called the state
health department to report 5 patients with boils on their lower legs
that had failed to respond to antibiotics. The dermatologist noted
that all 5 patients were pedicure customers at the same nail salon.
Dr. Winthrop's investigation identified 105 other infected customers
who typically began the $15 pedicure by sitting for a 10- to 15-
minute soak in water up to their calves or higher. Customers who had
shaved their legs with a razor before the pedicure showed increased
risk of infection.
The investigation turned up _M. fortuitum_ in the footbaths, and
laboratory tests showed the strains of the bacteria were identical to
those found among the infected customers, Dr. Winthrop said.
Dr. Winthrop said that the salon owner said he had never cleaned or
disinfected his machines in the year they had been operating, and
studies showed that the bacteria had built up behind an inlet suction
screen where it had been blocked by hair, grease, and clipped nails.
Dr. Winthrop said his team was conducting a study to monitor the
response of infected pedicure customers to standard antibiotics like
doxycycline and ciprofloxacin that usually are effective in combating
_M. fortuitum_.

[This is an interesting epidemiological niche for a ubiquitous
organism that has been known for a long time to be capable of causing
cutaneous and other infections in humans. Postsurgical or accidental
wound infections are common presentations. The current popularity of
nail salons is likely to result in other outbreaks as noted above. _M.
fortuitum_ and _M. chelonae_ are both rapid-growers (produce visible
colonies in 2-5 days on specialized media) among the mycobacteria, and
are often considered together as the _M. fortuitum-chelonae_ complex.
Both strains can cause cutaneous infections, but they produce
morphologically distinguishable colonies, _M. fortuitum_ producing
more filamentous extensions. - Mod.ES
