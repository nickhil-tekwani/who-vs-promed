French food retailer Leclerc has issued a recall of a brand of cheese made with raw milk that has been linked by the authorities to cases of _E. coli_ infection among young children. Leclerc, France's biggest supermarket chain by market share, said on its website that it was withdrawing Reblochon cheese supplied by cheesemaker Chabert in the Savoy region and sold under the "Nos regions ont des talents" ("Our regions have talent") brand.

The move came after the French health authorities linked 7 cases of _E. coli_ 026 bacterial infection among children between 1 1/2 and 3 years related to the cheese, which is a creamy specialty of the French Alps. "The investigations conducted by the health authorities have confirmed an epidemiological link between these cases and the consumption of whole Reblochon cheese made with raw milk under the brand and sold by the Leclerc chain in several regions," France's health and agriculture ministries said in a joint statement.

The ministries said that 6 of the 7 cases of infection involved hemolytic-uremic syndrome, a potentially serious condition that can cause kidney failure among young children. Up to 6 children were taken to hospital and 1 is yet to return home, the health ministry added in an emailed response. The cause of the _E. coli_ outbreak was not yet known, the ministries said in their statement, reiterating official guidance that raw milk and cheese made with raw milk should not be given to young children.

The agriculture ministry, which is overseeing the product recall, said it was unable to give details at this stage, while Leclerc did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

[Unpasteurized dairy products remain a potential risk for a variety of pathogens including enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, either the prototypic serotype or one of the other serotypes, in this case O26. In analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups of EHEC [enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_], it has been found that they belong to their own lineages and have unique profiles of virulence traits different from the prototypic O157 strain (1). The serogroups appearing to be most prominent are O26, O111, O128, and O103 (2), the O26 serotype being the implicated strain in this outbreak.

To have almost all the cases to be reported be associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome is very unusual, I would suspect that more cases are known or the particular strain is a hyperproducer of Shiga toxin or the specific toxin is more potent.

The following was extracted from Lutwick LI. Enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ infections. In: Confronting emerging zoonoses: the One Health paradigm. Yamada A, Kahn LH, Kaplan B, Monath TP, Woodall J, Conti LA (editors). Tokyo, Japan: Springer, 2014, 77-112:

Risk factors for the subsequent development of HUS after EHEC include children less than 10 years of age, elevated white blood cell counts, persistent low platelet counts without reversal and the use of either antimicrobial agents or antimotility agents during the diarrhea stage before or after bloody diarrhea develops. Since fever is generally not part of the presentation but significant abdominal pain is, patients with diarrhea, significant abdominal pain and no fever should be considered to have EHEC infection, and antimicrobial or antimotility agents should be avoided. Additionally, certain strains -- for example, the so-called clade 8 and the chimeric organism _E. coli_ O104:H4 -- can be associated with a higher risk of HUS.

HUS itself is a thrombotic illness primarily caused by the effects of the EHEC produced Shiga toxin acting on the vascular endometrium of organs where the toxin's receptors are expressed, particularly the kidney and brain. The syndrome consists of the combination of prominent low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia), intravascular red blood cell destruction (hemolysis) and diminished kidney function that can require hemodialysis. Neurological involvement occurs mostly in those who develop renal failure and the central nervous system involvement portends much higher mortality. Indeed, most of the acute mortality relates to neurological disease. Most patients will recover, but some, perhaps 10 percent, remain with renal failure and require chronic hemodialysis.
