[1] Thailand, what has been working so far...
Date: Sun 21 Jun 2020

Thailand is emerging as another success story in the COVID-19 pandemic. It is all the more remarkable considering the country was the first outside of China to detect a case of COVID-19 back in January [2020]. At the time, there was intense speculation the virus could ravage South East Asia. But Thailand -- along with Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, and Viet Nam -- have all had low case numbers despite dense populations and many direct flights to China.

Tanarak Plipat, who is the deputy-director general of the Department of Disease Control and has been at the forefront of Thailand's response to the coronavirus, says the country was considered high risk because of travel from China. "Put it this way, we know that there were a lot of travellers from China -- especially from Hubei Province and at the beginning of the epidemic," Dr Plipat told the ABC. "They thought we were the highest-risk country because of how many tourists from Hubei province travel to Thailand."

An army of volunteers helped with Thailand's success
----------------------------------------------------
In March [2020], Thailand declared a state of emergency. People were told to stay indoors and curfews were put in place. Businesses were ordered to close and there was a growing nervousness about what lay ahead with the fast-spreading virus.

But instead of locking herself indoors, health volunteer Aksorn Boosamsai went to visit neighbours in Klong Toey -- the largest slum in the centre of Bangkok. "I was scared ... but I think helping the community is one of my duties," the 52-year-old told the ABC. Mrs Boosamsai is a Village Health volunteer, an army of predominantly female, community-minded workers with basic medical training. While they are frequently called upon outside of pandemics, the strength of the volunteers has proven to be valuable amid the spread of COVID-19.

They have helped triage cases, sending people with symptoms to medical clinics for testing, and dispelled rumours and misinformation about coronavirus. "During the peak in March and April [2020], I went to visit the community every day," Mrs Boosamsai told the ABC, adding she 1st made sure to take precautions against being infected. "I gave them food, masks, hand gel, and taught the villagers how to wash their hands," she said.

The volunteers are an important part of an impressive suite of measures that Thailand has drawn upon to keep confirmed COVID-19 cases to just over 3000. There have only been 58 deaths so far from the virus. Among other things, the team of mostly women was responsible for helping to enforce quarantine when people travelled between provinces or back from overseas. They also visited areas considered vulnerable to outbreaks -- including jails, border communities, and migrant communities -- and provided important public health information in local communities.

James Wise, a former Australian ambassador to the country and author of Thailand: History, Politics and the Rule of Law, said the Village Health volunteers were "enormously important". "The key factor is they were well prepared for it," Mr Wise said. "[The volunteers] work closely with the local communities and then once coronavirus comes along you've got an army of foot soldiers who can be quickly briefed on the coronavirus and then can go out into the communities, spread information, dispel misinformation and check people's symptoms. And that's what they did."

How coronavirus first emerged in Thailand
------------------------------------
Thailand's initial response was not textbook perfect. As the virus quickly spread in Wuhan, Thailand did not at first block international flights. The 1st case arrived in Thailand on [8 Jan 2020].

The country has about 13 million Chinese tourists a year, and early on some citizens on social media accused the Government of putting tourism profits ahead of public health. There was also outrage after a major muay Thai [Thai boxing] match at Bangkok's indoor Lumpini Stadium on [6 Mar 2020] led to more than 100 coronavirus cases. And there was also confusion around the availability of masks, quarantine measures and the specifics of lockdown restrictions. "They are minor missteps if you have a look at the statistics," Mr Wise said. "Thailand has still done very well when it comes to the health side of things. I think the missteps have not been all that serious."

Cultural factors and lessons from SARS key to successful strategy
-----------------------------------------------------------------
What has helped Thailand manage well so far is it has drawn on systems that have been developed and refined after experiences with SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome). Those systems include sophisticated airport screening and a large network of highly trained health professionals across the country.

"[It's] so many things, not just one thing," Dr Plipat said. "We have a very strong public health system [and] in the very 1st month we were able to do 2 very important things." The 1st of those key measures involved the Communicable Disease Control Unit, which is made up of about 1000 teams distributed all over the country, including about 100 teams that can investigate dangerous pathogens. "We called those teams in to make sure they were alert," Dr Plipat said. "The 2nd thing we were able to do very quickly was ... call in again all the hospital staff from every province to make sure they knew how they could detect cases and how they could prevent outbreaks in the hospitals. "When we activate our system, everybody knows what to do."

Dr Plipat said there was also "very good collaboration" from Thai people, who all pitched in, took precautions, and followed the advice of health officials. Mr Wise added Thailand's excellent public health system proved its strength and cultural factors also helped. "Thais are pretty quick if they're feeling unwell, or think they're going to be exposed to people who are unwell, they immediately put on a mask," Mr Wise said. "There are some more general things as well. When [Thai people] greet each other, they don't shake hands, they don't kiss. [Instead] they bring their hands together in front of their face and bow gently. "So it's almost built-in social distancing in the way that they go about their normal lives."

Experts wary of underestimating impact of virus
-----------------------------------------------
However, Dr Plipat said he was extremely cautious not to celebrate any success too soon. "We are still very cautious and the Prime Minister himself also said this," he said. "We all know this virus can cause very minor symptoms and some of them [people infected] might not have any symptoms at all." Dr Plipat said the aim for health officials now was to maintain active surveillance of the virus.

That includes trying to identify anyone who might have COVID-19, even those who have minor symptoms. A big part of this strategy is testing. "Currently we test more than 7000 per day, or a little more than 50 000 per week," Dr Plipat said. "To me, I think that is a reasonable amount of testing we perform, although some might want us to do even more. "I think we will plan to do surveillance as best we can."

Along with maintaining active surveillance, economic recovery is set to be difficult. Mr Wise says while Thailand has managed to deal well with the health crisis, the Government, like those everywhere, is "going to be vulnerable to criticism" when it comes to rebuilding the economy. "It's very hard to get this right," he said.

The Thai Government has announced a range of packages to stimulate the economy. With the virus causing severe stress and strain on society, many people have lost their jobs. There will also be challenges ahead for the Village Health volunteers. Some are already receiving training on how to detect people whose mental health is suffering, and to refer them on to experts for treatment.

With the difficult period ahead, Mrs Boosamsai will be there to help. "I am glad that I am a part of giving knowledge to the community to protect themselves, and to help my country, even it is not a big part, only in my community," she said. "I feel proud that I am a part of helping the country and Thai people."

[It's time for an upbeat story in the midst of the serious impact that the SARS-CoV-2 is having globally. The existence of a functional village health worker cadre can be an excellent cog in the wheel of a Ministry of Health. They know the communities in which they work, they don't elicit suspicion and mistrust, and when they give health related messages they are followed. Using them to help enforce quarantine, and do outbreak surveillance within high risk vulnerable communities has been successful in many countries, Thailand being an excellent example.

I remember when the projections came out identifying Thailand and other countries in the region (while Thailand is in the South East Asia region, the other countries are in the Western Pacific region which has to date maintained a low level of disease transmission -- see section [4] below). One thing many of these countries have in common is their history/experience with SARS-CoV-1, the 1st major CoV outbreak with serious disease. And clearly, lessons were learned. More so than countries that were predominantly spectators having a few isolated imported cases without further spread.

Another important point raised in the article above is societal cultural differences -- the countries in this area naturally do social distancing when greeting people they know, unlike other cultures that hug and kiss people when they greet them; and the use of face masks to protect others from one who may have a respiratory illness.

Can we take away some lessons from this region... I think the answer should be yes.

[2] China (Tianjin): tracing a chain of transmission
Date: Tue 23 Jun 2020 3:31 AM CST
Source: Asia One/South China Morning Post [edited]
https://www.asiaone.com/china/tianjin-case-reveals-mystery-carrier-who-tests-negative-no-symptoms


The 1st local COVID-19 cases in northern Tianjin city in 110 days were infected by an asymptomatic carrier who was believed to have contracted the illness in neighbouring Beijing, a Tianjin CDC official said. "The conclusion is correct and scientific. The most likely method of transmission was human to human but the investigation is continuing in order to find the source of infection and to rule out other possible ways of infection," Zhang Ying, deputy director of the Tianjin Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters on Monday morning [22 Jun 2020].

The finding highlights the complex and difficult task China faces in trying to avoid a possible 2nd wave of COVID-19 caused by asymptomatic infections or imported cases. Cities with severe COVID-19 infections, such as Wuhan where the global pandemic started and Shulan in northeastern Jilin province, have imposed citywide nucleic acid tests.

Beijing, where 236 people were diagnosed with COVID-19 between [11 Jun 2020] and [21 Jun 2020] -- mostly related to the Xinfadi Food Wholesale Market -- is also putting in place gradual citywide testing to identify infections in the community.

In Tianjin, mystery surrounds how a 22-year-old hotel kitchen worker became infected. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 last Wednesday [17 Jun 2020] but had no history of travel 2 weeks before testing positive. All close contacts of the man took nucleic acid tests and were found to be negative. The man washed dishes and occasionally cleaned frozen seafood for his work. The centre tested samples of beef, lamb, salmon, vegetables, and fruit. They were found to be negative and so were environment samples from the workplace.

Genome sequencing of the man's virus sample showed it was identical to that found among patients in Beijing. A breakthrough came last Friday [19 Jun 2020] when the Tianjin CDC retested 55 chefs from the hotel, this time using a nucleic acid test to detect the existence of SARS-CoV-2 and a serological test to look for traces of infection. SARS-CoV-2 is the virus that causes COVID-19. One chef's serological test came back IgM positive indicating a recent infection, but nucleic acid tests were negative. The chef was tested 3 more times and the results were the same.

The chef, who showed no symptoms and has been under medical observation as a close contact, was interviewed by Zhang who believed the chef was the source of the infection in Tianjin. "The chef has been to Beijing many times in the past month [June 2020] and was exposed to public venues. He stayed in a restaurant and an entertainment venue from dinner to midnight on [8 Jun 2020]," Zhang said.

The CDC investigation showed the chef once talked with the 1st case -- the kitchen worker -- without a mask on. The 2 also used a basement smoking room with poor ventilation together once or twice a day. They were also believed to be in contact when the chef handed over his lunch tray to the kitchen worker, who was responsible for cleaning food residue and washing dishes.

But the chef was not classified as an official asymptomatic carrier because his nucleic acid test was negative. A positive test is the diagnosis threshold in China. Zhang said it was possible the chef was returning a false negative because he had a low viral load. The chef was under medical observation for 2 days before his positive antibody test, cutting off any possible transmission from him.

[A fascinating description of the process of defining a transmission chain undertaken in China. And an anecdotal report documenting a probable asymptomatic infection as part of the transmission chain. The use of genomic evidence to identify the origin of the virus. Coincidentally, the Chinese have uploaded the genomes on the viruses (3) isolated in Beijing in the past 24 hours, demonstrating it was closer to the virus identified in Europe than that circulating in China earlier in the pandemic (see https://www.genomeweb.com/scan/beijing-sequence).

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 22 Jun 2020.

Highlights
----------
- With influenza season starting in the southern hemisphere, WHO has alerted countries to maintain vigilance for influenza and prepare for the upcoming influenza season during the COVID-19 pandemic. WHO recommends that countries optimize the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) for both influenza and COVID-19 sentinel surveillance. Countries are urged to (i) sustain influenza surveillance, (ii) report surveillance data to WHO FluNet and FluID or through regional platforms, (iii) send representative viruses to WHO Collaborating Centres of GISRS without delay, and (iv) maintain influenza vaccination programs according to WHO guidance.

- A team of public health experts has been deployed to Tajikistan through the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN). The team will provide support to strengthen disease surveillance and laboratory testing to complement ongoing work by the COVID-19 response team in Tajikistan.

- WHO and collaborating agencies provided support to health authorities in Uzbekistan to assess their options for COVID-19 testing and identify potential resources in-country to increase their laboratory capacity.

- A nurse who is a refugee from Syria shared his experience as a COVID-19 responder in Turkey. His daily activities as part of the contact tracing team are "actively preventing the spread of the disease within communities, thereby protecting the health of hundreds of people."

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
-----------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 59.5% of the global newly reported cases and 65.3% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period. Brazil reported 38.2% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, the USA reported 35.7%, Chile 6.2%, Mexico 5.2%, and Peru 3.8%. The same 5 countries remained at the top, with the same ordering.

The European region reported 10.6% of the global newly reported cases and 7.0% of the newly confirmed deaths in the region. Russia reported 47.0% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by the UK 7.6%, Turkey 7.4%, Ukraine 4.2%, Belarus 3.5%, and Germany 3.3%. Again, same countries, minor juggling of orders and percentages day by day (Germany and Belarus switched places again).

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 11.2% of the global newly reported cases and 11.3% of global newly reported fatalities. Pakistan reported 26.1% of the regional newly reported cases followed by Saudi Arabia 19.7%, Iran 13.8%, Iraq 9.6%, Egypt 8.6%, Oman 5.3%, and Qatar 5.1%. Same countries, minor juggling of positions (Oman and Qatar switched places).

The African region reported 5.0% of the global newly reported cases and 3.0% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 60.2% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Cameroon 8.4%, Nigeria and Ghana 5.7%, each, Kenya 3.4%, and Cote d'Ivoire 2.8%. While South Africa and Nigeria are consistently numbers 1 and 2 in terms of the 24-hour increase in cases, other countries have less consistent reporting patterns and vary considerably from day to day.

The Western Pacific region reported 0.69% of the global newly reported cases and 0.47% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 62.0% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Singapore 24.9%, Japan 4.9%, Australia 2.4%, and China 2.0%. The outbreak associated with the Beijing Seafood markets continues to bring China to prominence in terms of daily newly confirmed cases. That said, the Philippines and Singapore are consistently numbers 1 and 2, respectively, and the other countries, including Malaysia and Australia, vary in daily reporting.

The South East Asia region reported 12.9% of the global newly reported cases and 12.9% of global deaths. India reported 75.4% of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 18.0%, Indonesia 4.4%, and Nepal 2.1%. Same countries, same order as in previous days, with India continuing to be the driving force in the regional growth in cases.

Impression: Europe seems to be stabilizing at a significantly lower rate, although Russia is still reporting 7000+ new cases a day (down from 8000+ per day). The Eastern Mediterranean has surpassed the European region, with Pakistan reporting around 4000+ cases a day and Saudi Arabia reporting around 4000+ cases a day. South East Asia has overtaken both the European and Eastern Mediterranean regions, with India reporting 8000-10 000+ cases a day (over 14 000 cases today 22 Jun 2020). The Americas region is usually reporting around 70 000 cases a day (over 90 000 cases today 22 Jun 2020), with Brazil usually reporting 25 000-30 000+ cases a day (over 34 000 cases today 22 Jun 2020) and the USA at 20 000-25 000+ a day (over 32 000 today 22 Jun 2020). In the Africa region, the regional proportion is slowly climbing, with South Africa reporting in the 3000-4000+ range daily, and the Western Pacific region is maintaining a very low rate compared with the other regions, with the Philippines averaging 500+ cases per day (over 600 cases today 22 Jun 2020). (Singapore had been reporting twice as many cases per day for a period of time but has dropped back over the past couple of weeks).

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 22 Jun 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has significantly decreased. The Americas region continues to increase, as does South East Asia, in terms of daily newly confirmed cases; the African region is noticeably increasing as well. The Americas region continues to greatly outnumber all other regions for daily reporting. - Mod.MPP]

[*On 2 Jun 2020, France completed a review of all positive lab tests reported and removed all duplicate tests on individuals who were counted more than once. This led to a decrease in cumulative case counts.
In the table above, NA is "not applicable"; those countries whose 1st case was reported after 1 Mar 2020 did not have cases on 1 Mar 2020. - Mod.MPP]

Countries with more than 5000 cases not on the list above (as the list has grown longer, we froze the list and maintain a list of countries passing the 5000-case mark):

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 9 186 153, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. The global case count rose by 1.5% in the past 24 hours. The USA, with more than 2.38 million confirmed cases, now represents 26.0% of the global cases of COVID-19, and Brazil, having crossed the 1 million mark (more than 1.11 million cases), represents 12.1% of the global cases of COVID-19. Other countries such as Chile, Peru, Mexico, India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Pakistan are reporting increased numbers of new and cumulative cases as well. A global total of 474 260 deaths have been reported, an increase of 3562 deaths in the past 24 hours. A reminder that in the absence of well-developed contact-tracing activities with testing of asymptomatic and mildly ill contacts, numbers of SARS-CoV-2 virus infections are significantly underreported: actual numbers may be 10-20 times larger. There are also individuals who stay at home throughout their illness, sometimes, unfortunately, dying at home, who are never officially confirmed as infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These data are presented to provide relative indicators of the situations in each of the countries and comparisons between countries and regions of the world.

In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19, followed by Brazil, Russia, India, the UK, Spain, Peru, Chile, (Chile surpassed Italy in the past 24 hours), Italy, and Iran at number 10. China is number 21. In descending rank order, USA is number 1 for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by Brazil, India, Russia, Chile, Mexico, Pakistan, South Africa, Bangladesh, and Saudi Arabia, all countries that are currently experiencing major community-based transmission and considered global hot spots.

The top 20 countries in terms of cumulative cases include 7 from the European region, 6 from the Americas region, 4 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 from the South-East Asia region, and 1 from the African region, no change in the past 24 hours. There are no countries from the Western Pacific region. The top 20 countries in terms of numbers of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours includes 7 from the Americas region, 7 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 from the European region, 2 from the South East Asia region and 1 from the African region. Again, there are no countries from the Western Pacific region. This listing very much reflects the "hot spots" in terms of countries and regions with ongoing high transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. - Mod.MPP]
