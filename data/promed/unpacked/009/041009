Cambodia's Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization
announced Wednesday [6 Apr 2011] that an 11-year-old girl from the
eastern province of Kompong Cham has died of avian influenza H5N1
[virus infection].

A joint statement sent to the media said the 11-year-old girl from
Kbal Au Village, Steung Trang District, Kompong Cham province died on
31 Mar 2011 as a result of respiratory complications after contracting
avian influenza H5N1 virus infection.

"The girl is the 14th person in Cambodia to become infected with the
H5N1 virus and the 10th to die from complications of the disease," the
statement said.

The patient became sick on 22 Mar 2011, and she was initially treated
by local villagers with no effect and was admitted to a local hospital
on 29 Mar 2011 before she was later, on 31 Mar 2011, sent to a
hospital in Siem Reap province, where she died just 4 hours after
admission.

"Avian influenza is still a threat to the health of Cambodians; early
identification of potential patients is the fastest way of ensuring
they can have correct treatment," said Minister of Health Mam Bunheng.
"I urge communities to be on the lookout for respiratory infection
with history of contact with dead or sick poultry to promptly seek
medical attention at the nearest health facilities," he added.
