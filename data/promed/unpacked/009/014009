SCOTLAND, Conn. -- The state Department of Agriculture has ordered the
destruction of 16 000 chickens at a Scotland poultry farm where a virus has
been discovered. The discovery of a rare and potentially devastating viral
disease was announced Monday. The state agency said avian influenza virus
was found last month in chickens on a farm raising broilers.
The state quarantined the Scotland site 12 Oct and was to begin destroying
the birds Tuesday. All poultry owners across New England were informed as
to how to protect their flocks.
Steps include preventing contact with other birds, knowing the source of
supplies, and controlling site access, according to Department of
Agriculture Deputy Commissioner Bruce Gresczyk. "Once it gets into a
species it can be devastating to fowl," Gresczyk said. "We haven't had any
in Connecticut in quite some time."
Tests taken from neighboring and area flocks have been negative, Gresczyk said.
