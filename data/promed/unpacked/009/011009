The Rhode Island Department of Health advises consumers not to eat Mediterranean Olives: Calcidica Sweet (Brand: Bel Frantoio) sold at any Ocean State Job Lot (OSJL) stores. OSJL is voluntarily recalling the product after Department of Health staff discovered that these products were not handled appropriately to prevent production of the toxin that causes botulism.

Mediterranean Olives: Calcidica Sweet, produced by Bel Frantoio and packaged in 34-oz. plastic containers, were sold in OSJL stores in New York and throughout the Northeast (Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine). This product is being voluntarily recalled because it is labeled "Keep Refrigerated," but was sold at room temperature, making it susceptible to germination of spores of _Clostridium botulinum_.

Other olive products produced by Bel Frantoio that were sold at Ocean State Job Lot, as well as other brands of olives, do not currently pose a safety issue. This recall applies only to this product sold at Ocean State Job Lot.

This product sold elsewhere, where refrigerated, is safe for consumption.

Ingestion of botulinum toxin from improperly stored foods can lead to serious illness and death.

No illnesses associated with this recall have been reported at this time.

[Many food product recalls that are botulism-related, as this one is, involve inadequate preparation conditions that would predispose to the production of the disease neurotoxin, not necessarily the finding of the toxin in the food.

Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated with the food. - Mod.LL
