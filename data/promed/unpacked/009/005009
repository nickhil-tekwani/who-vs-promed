A district in the south east of the impoverished Indian Ocean island of
Madagascar is battling a outbreak of the mosquitoborne chikungunya or
"stooped walk" virus, a local newspaper reported on Thursday [25 Feb 2010].

Chikungunya virus, which is transmitted by a bite from an infected
mosquito, causes high fever, headaches, and severe joint pain that can last
several weeks.

Around 44 000 families in and around Mananjary, a small port town on the
Mananjary River [Fianarantsoa Province], have been affected by the
outbreak, the Malaza daily reported.

The virus gets its name from the Swahili for "stooped walk", after the
appearance of a person affected by the disease, according to the World
Health Organization (WHO).

The latest outbreak in Madagascar has spread rapidly since the 1st case was
diagnosed in the capital Antananarivo on 11 Feb [2010]. Over 60 per cent of
the population in 8 Mananjary neighbourhoods were receiving medical
attention after displaying symptoms, the report said.

Checkpoints had been set up on access roads leading to the town and all
incoming vehicles were being sprayed with insecticide.

There are no specific treatments nor a vaccine for chikungunya [virus],
which occurs during the rainy season in parts of Africa, Southeast Asia,
southern India, and Pakistan, according to the WHO. The virus is rarely
deadly, but a number of fatalities were reported during a severe outbreak
in La Reunion Island near Madagascar in 2005-2006.

[One hopes that this is not a harbinger of anther massive chikungunya
outbreak in Indian Ocean Islands. Madagascar experienced a large
chikungunya virus outbreak in 2006, with sporadic cases since, the last 2
having occurred on 1 Jun 2009 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20090611.2156).
