Shigellosis outbreak spreads

The Marion County health department now confirms 150 cases of the disease
shigellosis at 24 day care centers since January. The facilities are in
various areas of town. All but one, in Beech Grove, are within the I-465
beltway. Compare that to only 22 cases in each of the past two years.
Most day cares take precautions against disease by bleaching, using gloves
and washing hands. The same recommendations the health department makes in
a letter sent to parents of children who've been sick.

Because itÂ’s a disease that originates from fecal matter, the best defense
is to wash your hands, especially before handling food, and after changing
diapers and doing laundry.
