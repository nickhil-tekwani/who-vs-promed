An elderly man in Martinique has become the 2nd person to die from dengue
fever this year [2007] on the Caribbean island, the health department said
on Thursday [25 Oct 2007].

The victim, who was in his 60s, died at a hospital Tuesday [23 Oct 2007].
He and a man in his 70s who died last month [September 2007] had both
contracted the hemorrhagic form of the mosquitoborne illness, officials said.

Authorities in Martinique, which declared a dengue epidemic in August
[2007], have announced more than 6400 suspected cases on the French
overseas department of about 430 000 people.

As some parts of the Caribbean and Latin America continue their efforts to
stem the tide of dengue cases, the Netherlands Antilles is keeping a close
eye on the situation.

Of the 269 lab tests for dengue done in the Netherlands Antilles between
January and early October [2007], 165 were suspected dengue cases, 53 were
confirmed to be dengue fever, and one case in Curacao was confirmed to be
dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF].

The report Update Dengue Fever 2007 compiled by the Curacao-based
Epidemiology and Research Unit shows that no lab tests were done for Saba
and St Eustatius so far this year [2007].

According to the report, a total of 25 dengue lab tests were done for St.
Maarten between January and early October [2007]. Of these, 14 were
suspected cases, 4 were confirmed to be dengue fever, and 7 tested negative.

The monthly breakdown shows that the highest number of suspected dengue
cases for St Maarten (4) was reported in August [2007], followed by January
[2007] when 3 cases were reported. The last confirmed dengue case (one) was
in September [2007]. The other confirmed cases were in March (2) and July
(one).

In Curacao a total of 195 tests were done, 37 of which were confirmed
dengue cases, 125 were suspected cases, 32 were negative, and one was
confirmed dengue hemorrhagic fever.

In Bonaire a total of 49 tests were done, 12 of which were confirmed dengue
fever, 26 were suspected cases, and 11 tested negative.

The data for the report were compiled thorough a laboratory-based
surveillance system, a collaboration between Analytic Diagnostic Centre
(ADC) and the Epidemiology and Research Unit of the Medical and Public
Health Services.

Head of the Preventative Section of Sector Health Care Affairs (SHCA) in St
Maarten, Dr Rachel Eersel, who had stated earlier that 11 suspected cases
had been reported via the local health surveillance system, said the
figures in the report did not show any alarming trends in St Maarten. She
had said earlier that some 11 suspected cases of dengue had been reported
on the island for the entire year 2006. The figures in the report, Eersel
said, are from lab tests done by the ADC lab in St Maarten and do not
include figures from French St Martin. She said some people went to the
French side for their tests and SHCA was working with French St Martin
health authorities to get a clearer picture of the number of cases for both
sides of the island. She said a close eye was being kept on the situation.

Head of the Veterinary and Hygiene Department, Tony Boyrard, had told this
newspaper in an earlier interview that the current weather conditions were
not favourable for fumigating. "We are monitoring everything and it doesn't
make sense to do fumigation at the moment," Boyrard had said, "because when
it rains the residue of the insecticide that will be left on trees will be
washed away and won't have any real effect. If we fumigate right now we
also risk the mosquitoes developing a resistance to the insecticide and if
we do get a dengue outbreak here it will be twice as difficult to control
it." Boyrard had said fogging would start as soon as weather conditions
permitted.

[Spraying trees with insecticides would be of limited value in controlling
_Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes, as these dengue virus vectors breed and feed in
and immediately around human habitations and other buildings. The key to
long term vector control is elimination of the water catchments in which
this mosquito breeds.

Belize on Friday [26 Oct 2007] confirmed 80 cases of "classical" dengue
fever since the start of the year [2007] and appealed to residents to take
all necessary precautions against the spread of the disease.

An official statement said that most of the cases were in the Corozal
district and Belize City and reported only "one confirmed case of dengue
hemorrhagic fever".

"The Ministry of Health is addressing the increased number of cases seen
recently in Belize with insecticide spraying and treatment of mosquito
breeding sites," the statement said, urging citizens to help stem the
spread by washing water storage containers at least once a week, changing
the water in flower pots every 4 to 5 days and avoid having containers that
can collect water on their premises.

The statement urged citizens travelling to countries where dengue fever is
epidemic to take all necessary precautions to reduce their risk of
acquiring the disease and named countries like Grenada, Jamaica, St Lucia,
St Vincent, Suriname, Puerto Rico, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mexico,
Guatemala, Salvador, and Honduras that have had dengue fever outbreaks this
year [2007].

[The focus on citizen responsibility for eliminating vector mosquito
breeding sites is laudatory. It would be interesting to know what public
education efforts are being made, and with what success. A zoomable health

Costa Rica's Caja de Seguro Social [CCSS; the national social security
system that includes health care. - Mod.TY] has reported since January
[2007] over 24 000 cases of dengue, including 4000 children under 14. The
CCSS says the disease, transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes, has
affected over 940 children of 4 years [of age], 1230 between 5-9 years, and
1989 10-14 years.

So far there have been 6 fatalities, including 2 babies less than 12
months, and 250 people contracted the very aggressive and lethal
hemorrhagic strain.

The most affected areas are Guanacaste and Puntarenas on the Pacific coast
and Limon, in the Caribbean. There have also been over 60 cases in the
capital [San Jose].

Specialists claim that a child with dengue is 15 times more prone than an
adult to die.

CCSS Health Development director, Jose Miguel, Rojas announced a sanitation
and prevention drive to eliminate the mosquito breeding sites.

[If any Central American country can launch an effective, citizen-based
vector control program, Costa Rica, with its relatively small population,
fairly good infrastructure, and high literacy rate, should be able to. The
2007 rainy season, still going on, has been unusually wet in Costa Rica,
which may be related to the intensity of dengue virus transmission there.

The Ministry of Health has ordered provinces and cities to adopt stringent
measures to prevent and control dengue fever as the risk of new outbreaks
is high in flood-prone areas. Nearly 80 000 cases of mosquitoborne dengue
fever have occurred nationwide this year [2007], 68 of them fatal. The
southern provinces of Dong Thap, Tien Giang, and An Giang continue to lead
the country in the number of cases.

The dengue fever patients' number in the city has risen to 1527 since
August [2007], a provincial health official said on Tuesday [23 Oct 2007].

Around 48 new cases were reported from different areas on Tuesday [23 Oct
2007]. The official said that 2 hospitals, which were earlier reluctant to
share information about dengue fever patients, started giving reports about
those admitted there. The number of patients, according to this
information, appears to have increased.

As many as 110 patients tested positive for dengue [virus infection] were
still admitted in the hospitals. The official said a total 534 cases tested
positive and 11 of these had died.

Doctors said that there were several issues associated with dengue fever.
The concerned authorities, they allege, are not aware of ways to deal with
it. Doctors were also not trained on how to diagnose and manage dengue
cases properly. Without proper management, the case fatality rate of dengue
hemorrhagic fever can exceed 20 per cent. Modern intensive supportive
therapy may reduce the rate to less than one per cent.

Dengue fever is caused by 4 types of dengue viruses known as dengue 1, 2,
3, and 4. If an individual is infected with type 3, the person develops
antibodies against dengue 3 virus. This infection is known as primary
dengue infection (1st time infection). If this person is later infected
with the same dengue 3, there will be no relapse [reinfection] as the
person will have become immune. However, if this person is infected with a
dengue virus other than type 3, there will be [may be. - Mod.TY] severe
infection (known as secondary infection -- 2nd time, 3rd time, and so on).

Dr Rafiq Khanani, associate professor and senior pathologist at the SMC
[Sindh Medical College] and DUHS [Dow University of Health Sciences] said
on Tuesday [23 Oct 2007] that many doctors not knowing this fact discarded
the diagnosis of dengue fever if dengue IgG is present. Several
laboratories are offering only IgM antibody test and are missing this
important group of patients by giving a dengue IgM negative report to
infected individuals, he added.

Another problem is that dengue test kits are from different manufacturers
and a large number of kits detect dengue type 2 only -- resulting in a
large number of negative reports, Khanani believed. He suggests that
authorities ensure that kits available are up to standards, tests are done
properly by qualified personnel/laboratories, and doctors be trained to
interpret reports.

Another important aspect of dengue, which is not recognised commonly, is
that a majority of those infected have no symptoms and infection can be
detected only if a dengue antibody test is performed. Khanani pointed out
that the World Health Organization had a programme known as DEWS [dengue
early warning system]. It requires a system for early reporting of
infectious diseases so that appropriate control measures are instituted in
timely manner. However, implementation strategy is poorly understood and,
therefore, these diseases assume epidemic proportions.

[The reluctance of hospitals to report dengue virus infections is
dismaying. Good surveillance, supported by competent laboratory services,
is essential to rapid case detection and focused mosquito vector control
efforts. Help in establishing reliable diagnostic techniques is available
through the WHO, and are clearly needed here.
