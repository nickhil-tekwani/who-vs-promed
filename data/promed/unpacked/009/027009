A man has tested positive for the Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) at Pims. Pims media coordinator Dr Waseem Khawaja told Dawn that the patient arrived at the hospital a few days ago with complaining of fever and oral bleeding. He had the symptoms of Congo virus so blood samples were sent to the National Institute of Health (NIH) which tested positive for the disease. Dr Khawaja said the patient belonged to Murree and had cattle in his house. "It was suggested that the health department immediately send a team to the area as the village is at the risk of being infected," he added.

CCHF is a tickborne viral disease with symptoms such as high fever, muscle pain, dizziness, abnormal sensitivity to light, abdominal pain and vomiting.

In this meeting, Dr Munir Ahmed directed all district officers to raise awareness campaigns on Congo virus for the general public. He said very few cases of Congo fever have been reported yet in Punjab. However, both health and livestock departments are working together in the field. He added that district administration has already been directed to take special measures.

If these symptoms appear, patients should visit the nearest government hospital, he added.

[3] Health advisory [notice]: K-P health department issues Congo fever alert

With an advisory [notice] already in effect over dengue owing to the monsoon rains, the provincial health department has issued a fresh alert over the possibility of the Congo fever spreading during Eidul Azha.

The Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) Health Department has warned the public that the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), commonly called Congo fever, can be transmitted via 'ticks', responsible for severe outbreaks in humans but never affect[s] cattle, sheep and goats ['never' here means the cattle do not show disease signs. - Mod.UBA].

With a significant number of cases reported across K-P every year, the alert stated that the affected districts over the past 2 years include Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat, and Bannu though cases have been reported from Mansehra and Abbottabad districts as well.

The disease can spread to humans either by tick bites or through contact with disease-infected animal tissues during and immediately after slaughter. CCHF outbreaks constitute a threat to public health services, the advisory noted. It added that most of the cases took place among people involved in the livestock industry, including agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, veterinarians or those who have been involved in slaughtering an animal or have been in contact with tissues of the infected animal.

Human-to-human transmission can occur as a result of close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons, it informed, adding that the hospital-acquired infections could also occur due to improper sterilisation of medical equipment, reuse of needles and contamination of medical supplies.

"Contact with animals increases in Eidul Adha where most of the general public is involved in slaughtering or handling of animal tissues or blood," the alert read, adding, "It is therefore requested to adopt preventive measures to protect yourself from this deadly disease."

The department advised using acaricides (pesticides designed for ticks and mites), reducing the risk of tick-to-human transmission, wearing protective clothing (long sleeves, long trousers, trousers tugged in socks when handling animals), light coloured clothing to allow easy detection of ticks, using approved chemicals intended to kill ticks, approved repellent on the skin and clothing, regularly examining clothing and skin for ticks. "If found, remove them safely and never touch or crush the tick with bare hands besides do not try to remove the tick with your fingers," it said, adding that people must avoid areas where the ticks were in abundance and seasons when they were most active.

[The first confirmed case of CCHF in Pakistan was reported in 1976 followed by outbreaks from almost all areas of the country, mainly Balochistan province where the disease still remains entrenched. Genetic analysis of the viruses has confirmed the presence of Asia-1 and Asia-2 genotypes in this province. In Pakistan, CCHF exhibits 2 annual peaks from March to October [Abbas et al. Int J Infect Dis. 2005 Jan; 9(1):37-42]. Since 2000, there has been an increasing trend in the numbers of cases, and cases have been reported from previously uninfected areas across all provinces and regions. Mapping the areas with relatively high incidences of the tick vector and the virus is an essential step to target surveillance and prevention programmes. - Mod.UBA
