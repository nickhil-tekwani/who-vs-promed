Wild poliovirus confirmed in China 1 Sep 2011
---------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in China has informed WHO that wild poliovirus
type 1 (WPV1) has been isolated from 4 young children, aged between 4
months and 2 years, with onset of paralysis between 3 and 27 Jul 2011.
All 4 cases are from Hetian prefecture, Xinjiang Uygur autonomous
region, China. Genetic sequencing of the isolated viruses indicates
they are genetically related to viruses currently circulating in
Pakistan. The last WPV case in China, reported in 1999, was due to an
importation from India. The last indigenous polio case occurred in
China in 1994.

A national team of clinicians, laboratory experts, epidemiologists,
and public health experts has been dispatched to the affected region,
to assist in the investigation and planning of response activities,
and this team will be joined by international support as required.
National, Xinjiang autonomous region and local public health
authorities are currently conducting an epidemiological investigation,
including collection of stool specimens from contacts and evaluation
of vaccine coverage.

The Ministry of Health plans to conduct an initial response
vaccination campaign in early September [2011], targeting 3.8 million
children aged under 15 years in the key affected outbreak area, and
children aged under 5 years in other areas of Xinjiang. This website
will be updated as more information becomes available.

[For the interactive HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Xinjiang Uygur
autonomous region, China, see http://healthmap.org/r/1aQE. In the
prior post on these cases, the newswire mentioned that the WPV
identified in this cluster was the same as a WPV circulating in
Pakistan in 2009. The notice above mentions the virus involved is
similar to those currently circulating in Pakistan, hence this
moderator's previous observation that the virus had most likely been
circulating silently in the region for 2 years might have been
erroneous. - Mod.MPP]

- Genetic sequencing of a case of WPV1 in Nyanza province, western
Kenya, continues. While it is therefore an "advance notice case" and
not officially reported, this case has significant implications for
polio eradication in the Horn of Africa. The most recent WPV found in
the greater Horn of Africa area was from Uganda, with onset of
paralysis on [15 Nov 2010]. This was a continuation of the 2009
outbreak in the Turkana region of northern Kenya.

Afghanistan
-----------
Five new cases were reported in the past week, bringing the total
number of cases for 2011 to 18 (all WPV1). All 5 cases were due to
wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) and all were in districts that had not
yet reported cases in 2011 -- Nad Ali in Hilmand or Shah Wali Kot and
Panjwayi in Kandahar. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on
[15 Aug 2011] in Panjwayi district, Kandahar province, in the
country's south.

India
-----
India has reported just one case this year [2011] -- WPV1 with onset
of paralysis on [13 Jan 2011] in West Bengal. The country has gone
more than 7 months without reporting a single case.

Nigeria
-------
One case was reported in the past week. The total number of cases
reported from Nigeria in 2011 is now 26 (19 WPV1, 7 WPV3), compared to
6 at this time last year [2010]. This week's case was reported with
onset of paralysis on [18 Jul 2011] in Nguru Local Government Area
(LGA), Yobe state. This is the 1st case to be reported in Nguru this
year [2011]. The most recent case remains the WPV1 reported in Bagudo
LGA, Kebbi State, with onset of paralysis recorded on [20 Jul 2011].

Pakistan
--------
Five cases (all WPV1) were reported this week, bringing the total
number of cases for 2011 to 77 (76 WPV1 cases and one WPV3 case). The
most recent case (WPV1) had onset of paralysis on [17 Aug 2011] in
Peshawar district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in north west Pakistan.

Angola
------
No new cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cases
for 2011 remains 4. The most recent case (WPV1) had onset of paralysis
on [27 Mar 2011] in Kuando Kubango.

Chad
----
Nine cases were reported in the past week, all WPV1. The total number
of cases for 2011 has risen to 109 (106 WPV1, 3 WPV3). The most recent
case had onset of paralysis on [31 Jul 2011] in Koumra district of
Mandoul province. This is the 1st case this year to be reported in
Mandoul. Newly infected districts this week include Moissala district
of Mandoul province along with Abou Deia and Haraze Manuegne in
Salamat province.

Democratic Republic of the Congo
--------------------------------
No new cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cases
for 2011 remains 75 (all WPV1). The most recent case had onset of
paralysis on [25 Jul 2011] in Kimvula, Bas-Congo.

Horn of Africa
--------------
No wild poliovirus cases have been officially reported this week. The
total number of cases officially reported in 2011 remains zero.
However, the Ministry of Health of Kenya has alerted WHO that it has
isolated WPV1 from an AFP [acute flaccid paralysis] case with onset of
paralysis on [30 Jul 2011] in Nyanza Province, on Lake Victoria,
western Kenya. This is exactly 2 years since Kenya reported its last
case.

West Africa
-----------
Five cases were reported from this region in the past week -- 3 WPV3
from Cote d'Ivoire, one WPV3 from Mali, and one WPV1 from Niger. The
total number of cases for 2011 in the West African region is now 46 (2
from Burkina Faso, 34 from Cote d'Ivoire, 2 from Guinea, 6 from Mali,
and 2 from Niger). All but one of the WPV cases reported in West
Africa this week are in districts that had not previously reported any
WPV cases this year. The case reported in Niger is the 1st case of
WPV1 reported from West Africa this year. The most recent case remains
the WPV3 reported in Siguiri district of Kankan province, Guinea, with
onset of paralysis on [27 Jul 2011].

[The continued identification of cases in endemic countries in
geographic areas that have not confirmed cases recently is
disconcerting, as is the continued identification of WPV associated
disease in countries that had been considered polio free and are now
identifying cases. The identification of a WPV case in Kenya now 2
years since the last case, following in the footsteps of having
identified a WPV case in Uganda in November 2010 genetically similar
to a virus that had circulated in Kenya the previous year suggests
that there continues to be undetected circulation of WPV in Kenya and
Uganda that is not being detected through surveillance activities.
