Scientists say they're not sure why about 30 percent of lobsters in
eastern Long Island Sound have a disease that's causing their shells
to waste away.

Researchers say the main question is why the lobsters can't defend
themselves against the bacterial attack of shell disease, which
doesn't affect their meat but usually lands them in canning factories
because of their unsightly shells.

Hans Laufer, a University of Connecticut research professor of
molecular and cellular biology, told the Connecticut Post that
chemicals known as alkylphenols that are used to make plastics and
detergents are being found in lobster body tissues.

Laufer says the chemicals are toxic and interfere with lobsters'
shell development.

Other scientists are looking at bacterial agents.

[This article provides no new information from when the disease was
posted in 2005. The question becomes, what attacks the shell
initially, the chemicals or the bacteria? If it is bacteria, why are
we seeing it now instead of some earlier time, such as in the 1990s?

If it is a chemical, could we ask the same question, or has the
concentration of the chemicals changed over 10, or 15 or 20 years? Do
we even know whether this chemical was around 20 years or more ago?
If it is the chemical, what level is harmful?

At this stage, it seems there are more questions than answers. - Mod.TG]
