Bacteria called Vancomycin Resistant Enterococci (VRE) were discovered in a
patient who died in April at the International Medical Center of Japan in
Shinjuku Ward, Tokyo, sources said Tuesday. The man, who was in his 50s,
died of pneumonia on April 21, after being hospitalized for serious liver
trouble in January. A test conducted on April 28 discovered VRE in a blood
sample that had been taken from the man on April 15. The relationship
between the patient's death and VRE is not clear, but the hospital is
investigating how the patient became infected.
Last month, VRE was detected in three patients at a general hospital in
Nagano Prefecture, and one of them, a 76-year-old woman, died.
VRE was first reported in this country three years ago in Kyoto, and about
20 cases have come to light since then. In 1998, VRE was found in a patient
who died at a university hospital in Kyushu. The bacteria were also
detected in three inpatients at a university hospital in Shikoku.
According to the ministry, six VRE cases were reported from April to
mid-July. Two were in Akita Prefecture, and one each in Tokyo, Nagano,
Shizuoka and Hiroshima prefectures.
The amount of vancomycin antibiotics used in Japan is much less than that
used in Europe and the United States. Alarmed by the fact that VRE is
causing increasing problems abroad and is spreading in hospitals at home,
the Health and Welfare Ministry is gathering information on the bacteria.
The ministry issued a statement in April last year encouraging hand washing
at hospitals to prevent infection. In the same month it also required
medical institutions to inform authorities if they have VRE-infected patients.
