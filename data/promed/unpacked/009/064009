39th Remington Winter Course in Infectious Diseases
---------------------------------------------------
The Winter Course in Infectious Diseases and the University of Nebraska Medical Center, Center for Continuing Education are pleased to announce that the 39th Remington Winter Course in Infectious Diseases will take place from 10-15 Feb 2013 at the Westin Riverfront at Beaver Creek in Avon, Colorado.

This comprehensive 6-day course is designed to educate healthcare professionals about the latest advances in the epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of infectious diseases. Topics will be presented in lectures, panel discussions, debates, case presentations, and question and answer sessions. Meet the professor sessions will allow for personal exchange between participants and faculty.

Course directors: A W Karchmer, MD and Richard P Wenzel, MD MSc

Planning Committee: Kieren A Marr, MD FIDSA; Jose G Montoya, MD FACP FIDSA; A W Karchmer, MD; Cynthia L Sears, MD; Richard P Wenzel, MD MSc

Upon completion of this activity, participants will be able to:
1. summarize best practices for treating infection in immunocompromised transplant recipients, particularly with regard to multi-drug-resistant pathogens;
2. identify patients who are at increased risk for opportunistic fungal infections or endemic mycoses and review tailored treatments that include pharmacological and, when necessary, surgical interventions;
3. examine the treatment guidelines for preventing and treating opportunistic infections in patients with HIV/AIDS and monitoring recommendations for patients receiving HAART;
4. identify treatment strategies and alternatives for drug-resistant infections such as MRSA, VRE, Acinetobacter, and NDM-1 producing Enterobacteriaceae, as well as infection control recommendations;
5. describe optimal infection control protocols to reduce exposure to _Clostridium difficile_ and treatment strategies for resistant and relapsed infection;
6. discuss appropriate use of monotherapy and combination therapy for treatment of hepatitis C virus based on individual patient and disease factors;
7. assess emerging antibiotic resistance and reduced susceptibility in gram positive and Gram negative pathogens and the use of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles in achieving effective therapy;
8. identify emerging treatments and issues associated with invasive pneumococcal infections;
9. review the current recommendations for vaccines in children and adults, and the concerns that have led to decreased acceptance of vaccines in the US and elsewhere, and the need for new vaccines to prevent difficult hospital and community-acquired infections;
10. summarize best practices for treating device-related infections, including left ventricular assist device-related infections;
11. examine the current treatment options for treating tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections;
12. discuss the diagnosis and treatment of common gastrointestinal infections caused by Norovirus and the importance of the microbiota of the GI tract in health and disease;
13. apply new information gained from broad topic updates in areas of interest to ID specialists and internal medicine physicians, including travel related infections, CAP/VAP, and emerging infections.
