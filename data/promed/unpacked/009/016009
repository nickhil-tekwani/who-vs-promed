Onychomadesis outbreak in Valencia , Spain, June 2008
-----------------------------------------------------
Onychomadesis describes complete nail shedding from the proximal
portion. It is consecutive to a nail matrix arrest and can affect
both fingernails and toenails. It is a rare disorder in children.
Except for serious generalised diseases or inherited forms, most
cases are considered to be idiopathic. Nail matrix arrest has been
associated with a variety of drug exposures and systemic illnesses,
including infections, and may result in a variety of changes,
including transverse ridging (Beau's lines) and nail shedding (onychomadesis).

Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is a contagious enteroviral infection
occurring primarily in children and characterised by a vesicular
palmoplantar eruption and erosive stomatitis. The association of HFMD
with Beau's lines and onychomadesis has been reported by Bernier et
al., 2001 [1] and Clementz et al., 2000 [2].

Since 15 Jun 2008, an increasing number of cases of onychomadesis
have been detected in dermatology hospital services. The suspicion of
an epidemic started when 14 cases at a kindergarten were reported by
the school health care services. Twelve of the cases were children
between one- and two-years-old. At the same time, a paediatric
dermatology clinic notified 5 cases from others places within Spanish
public health surveillance procedures. Revision of the medical
literature did not indicate an ongoing epidemic outbreak of
onychomadesis anywhere else in the world.

By the end of this analysis on 30 Jun 2008, 180 cases in children
have been reported to the public health services, after the alert
communication to the health care services.* A case was defined as "a
child with loss of nails without previous traumatic or systemic
disease." The majority of cases were children at the age of one or 2
years [These data are tabulated in the original text].

A preliminary analysis of data from 89 cases revealed an association
with 'hand, foot and mouth' disease (HFMD) as antecedent of
onychomadesis within 30 days after clinical diagnosis from paediatric
or dermatology consultation. (Odds for HFMD/CASE 5.836; CI95 percent:
2.113-16.120; p<0.001).

A case-control study is being carried out. Habits, diet, previous
diseases in the 60 days before onychomadesis, treatments and exposure
to other cases of HFMD are been investigated. Blood and faeces
samples are been collected from paired cases and controls, aiming to
identify the virus related with the illness. Mycosis and heavy metals
have been ruled out as the cause by specialised laboratories.

No hypothesis has currently been established, but epidemiologic
investigation suggests a strong cause-relation with some enterovirus.
Initial results as of 2 Jul 2008 have detected IgG antibodies against
coxsackievirus in 52 subjects (22 positive cases and 8 positive
controls). Multi-ethnic origin, absence of geographical concentration
and age-related concentration excludes a personal characteristic or
condition and reinforces the hypothesis [of] virus activity changes.

To our knowledge, such an outbreak has not been described in Spain
before. At the time of publication of this article (3 Jul 2008), the
total number of confirmed cases was 213.

[An outbreak of onychomadesis of this magnitude in children is an
unusual event. It will be interesting to follow the course of this
investigation to see if the linkage with a prior outbreak of hand,
foot and mouth disease can be established. Since several different
enteroviruses can be responsible for causing outbreaks of hand, foot
and mouth disease, it may be premature to associate the outbreak with
coxsackievirus infection. - Mod.CP]
