[1] Cholera, possible - Syria/Iran border (refugee camp)

Despite the efforts of the Iraqi government and WHO to contain a recent
cholera outbreak, the disease has already spread to half of the country and
has also crossed the border into Iran, according to WHO and Iranian
authorities. Refugee camps on Iraq's borders and inside Iran, Syria, and
Jordan have been warned of the outbreak by the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).
"Many of us are suffering from diarrhea. Doctors are not always available
and this week we discovered that 2 men who were at our camp for a short
period of time are now in Baghdad being treated for cholera," said a 36
year old displaced woman living in a camp on the Iraqi-Syrian border.
"We are living in an unhygienic environment. Toilets are close to our
living quarters, vegetables and beans are not washed properly. We're
therefore vulnerable to catching the disease," she added.

of having cholera". Other countries neighboring Iraq are going to the alert
to detect cases of cholera within their boundaries, including Jordan
(<http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-10/07/content_6842297.htm>) and
Saudi Arabia
(<http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hQB6T4vJMhb7vacrFWe5Ll37fM8g>). These
countries are located on the western borders of Iraq although most of the
Iraqi cases are reported in the eastern (and primarily north eastern) part
of the country. A map of Iraq showing its borders can be found at

[2] Cholera - China (Hong Kong SAR) ex Thailand

The Centre for Health Protection is investigating a cholera case involving
a 29 year old Shenzhen woman, who visited Thailand with her Hong Kong
husband from 27 Sep to 1 Oct 2007.
The woman came down with diarrhea and vomiting on 1 Oct 2007 and was
admitted to a Shenzhen hospital the next day. She is in hospital and in a
stable condition. Tests conducted yesterday [5 Oct 2007] showed she had
infection with _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 El Tor Ogawa. Her close contacts in
Shenzhen showed no symptoms. Her 49 year old husband, living in Hong Kong,
also had diarrhea and vomiting on 1 Oct 2007, but the symptoms subsided. He
was admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital for observation.
As the couple joined the Thailand tour in Hong Kong, the centre is tracing
the other 29 tour members and will put them under medical surveillance.
Preliminary investigation showed that the other members did not have symptoms.
