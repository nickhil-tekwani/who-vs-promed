Polio up in Pakistan as clashes impede vaccination
--------------------------------------------------
Fighting between the Pakistani army and Islamist
militants as well as hostility towards
vaccinating teams has led to a sharp increase in
polio cases in Pakistan this year [2008], health
workers said on Friday [19 Sep 2008]. Pakistan is
one of the few countries where the deadly,
crippling disease still exists. Polio spreads
through poor hygiene, and is also endemic in Nigeria, India and Afghanistan.

Pakistan has had 55 polio cases this year
compared with 32 last year and 39 in 2006.
Pakistani forces have been battling militants in
the northwest of the country, in areas on the
Afghan border, disrupting efforts to make sure
every child gets vaccination drops.

"Parts of Swat and parts of FATA, we haven't been
able to go and immunise children for quite some
time. So that means we have a build-up of
susceptible children that haven't been
immunised." said Melisa Corkum, a UNICEF communications officer.

FATA is the Federally Administered Tribal Areas,
7 semi-autonomous ethnic Pashtun dominated
regions in the northwest, where militants
fighting the Pakistani government and foreign
forces in Afghanistan have sanctuaries. Swat is a
valley in North West Frontier Province where fighting has also been intense.

"Vaccinators are really putting themselves at
risk in these areas," Corkum said.

Polio can be prevented with the use of vaccines
that have eliminated the virus as a public health
threat in most of the world. But as well as
fighting between the army and militants,
vaccinating teams also have to contend with
suspicion and even hostility from people who
believe the vaccination campaign against the
highly infectious disease is a plot.

Some Muslim clerics in the conservative tribal
belt along the Afghan border have opposed
anti-polio campaigns, saying it is a
foreign-funded ploy to sterilise people. Last
year [2007], a doctor and a health worker were
killed in a roadside blast in the Bajaur region
on the Afghan border, leading to the suspension
of a vaccinating campaign. A Health Ministry
official said vaccinators had even been attacked
during brief peace pacts between militants and government forces.

"During recent peace deals with the militants,
the government had tried to stop them from
attacking our vaccinators. But still they
attacked," said the official, who declined to be
identified. "During the last campaign one of our
doctors was kidnapped," he said.

Health authorities have run information campaigns
with the help of Muslim clerics in favour of
vaccination to try persuaded parents of the benefits of immunisation.

UN agencies call for peace as polio vaccination
campaigns continue in Afghanistan
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As the International Day of Peace, [21 Sep 2008],
approaches the World Health Organisation (WHO),
the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) are calling on all
parties to the conflict to take a pause on the
International Day of Peace to allow safe access
for vaccinators to carry out polio immunization
-- a life saving activity. The sanctity of
schools must be respected, the lives of students
and teachers must be protected, and the schools
must not be used by any parties to the conflict
for operations or political reasons.

Polio and lack of access to education affect
every family in Afghanistan. WHO and UNICEF are
urging the actors involved in the conflict not to
harm the vaccinators and allow the peace polio
immunizations to take place from [21-23 Sep 2008]
in order to vaccinate 1.8 million newborns and
children under the age of 5. More (pdf)

The vaccination campaigns are due to start a week
after a suicide bombing killed 3 people in a UN
convoy in Kandahar as they were preparing the
campaigns. ["Two doctors on WHO duty and their
driver were assassinated today by a vehicle-borne
suicide bomber in Kandahar province of southern
Afghanistan. Dr. Shamsul Haq MH Kakar, Dr. Mamoon
Taher Taheri, along with their driver Azizullah
Almas from the UN Assistance Mission in
Afghanistan, were on their way to prepare
logistics for a polio vaccination campaign in the
region next week when their convoy was
attacked." a quote from a news release on the
polio eradication website dated 14 Sep 2008,
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/LatestNews200809.asp#AFGH>
- Mod.MPP]

In 2008 ([1 Jan - 17 Sep]), more than 18 cases of
polio have been reported mostly in Southern and
Eastern regions where accessing vulnerable
communities has been hindered due to the fighting
on the ground. Polio is the target of a global
eradication effort, and Afghanistan is one of
only 4 countries left with endemic polio. [the
other 3 countries are India, Pakistan and Nigeria. - Mod.MPP]

In safeguarding every child's rights to
education, UNESCO and UNICEF are urging
communities across Afghanistan to renew their
commitments in protecting schools and literacy
centres; students and teachers from attacks.

In 2008 ([1 Jan - 10 Sep]) Â­ total of 199 school
attacks have taken place resulting in 37 deaths and 33 injured.

UNICEF, UNESCO, and WHO are urging all factions
and communities to take 21 Sep 2008 as an
opportunity to renew their commitments and
respect for children's rights to life through
receiving essential health services including the
life-saving polio vaccine and in gaining safe
access to education away from politics and conflict on the ground.

As of 16 Sep 2008 there have been 655 cases of
polio reported from Nigeria. The date of onset of
the most recent case was 24 Aug 2008, and
involved a wild poliovirus type 1. The date of
onset of most recent wild poliovirus type 3 was 24 Jul 2008.

The following information is from the monthly
situation update, 26 Aug 2008, available at:
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/current_monthly_sitrep.asp>

- In 2008, 597 cases have been reported (547 type 1 and 49 type 3).

- The highest number of type 1 polio cases in
any state in the country this year are from Kano (204 of 547 type 1 cases).

- With recent confirmation of a polio case in
Burkina Faso caused by wild poliovirus with
origin in northern Nigeria, the current type 1
outbreak affecting northern Nigeria threatens to
spread further. Transmission of the virus remains
intense, and large-scale population movements are
expected for the upcoming Hajj season (pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia).

- To minimise the risk of international spread
and as part of urgent efforts to stop the current
type 1 outbreak, the Government of Nigeria has
recently established high-level Task Forces, to
rapidly overcome the operational challenges which
continue to mar polio campaigns, and to ensure
that state and local government leaders are held
accountable to polio eradication efforts.

- While this restructuring is encouraging, it
must now translate urgently into improvements in campaign quality.

- Further efforts must be made to achieve
operational improvements, including better
vaccinator selection and supervision, enhanced
and coordinated social mobilization efforts, and
increased use of independent out-of-house monitoring of activities.

The following information is from the Polio News
published 1 Sep 2008, available at:
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/polionews/PolioNews31.pdf>

Presidential action following international alert
on spread of polio from Nigeria
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The government of Nigeria has set in motion new
emergency measures to respond to an escalating
type 1 polio outbreak that is a major threat to
its polio eradication efforts, as President Umaru
Yar'Adua publicly stated his intention "to do
everything humanly possible to ensure that polio
is finally and totally eradicated from Nigeria."
Backed by a Presidential Initiative for
Immunization and Child Survival, a Steering
Technical Committee on Polio Eradication --
headed by the Minister of Health of Nigeria -- is
now to be advised by a high-level Task Force
mandated to improve eradication activities in the country.

On the heels of this development, the Expert
Review Committee on Polio Eradication and Routine
Immunization in Nigeria (ERC) met in Kano and
concluded that the outbreak is due to a failure
to vaccinate: only 42 percent of children in
states with a high burden of polio have 3 or more
doses of vaccine, against 87 percent in
polio-free states. The outbreak is concentrated
in the north; over a third of the 483 cases
reported from Nigeria to date this year [2008]
are from Kano state alone. The ERC stressed that
mechanisms are needed to ensure that the
high-level political commitments are translated
into local government accountability for
high-quality implementation of polio campaigns.

Over the past months, polio from northern
Nigerial has spread west to Benin, north to Niger
and east to Chad, and the possibility of further
spread is magnified by large-scale population
movements across Africa for the Hajj (annual
pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia). The WHO has
officially notified its Member States of this growing risk.

[According to the most recent data available on
the polio eradication website (as of 16 Sep 2008)
there were a total of 1210 cases of polio
reported from 14 countries since 1 Jan 2008
<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp>.
The 4 endemic countries (India, Nigeria, Pakistan
and Afghanistan) account for 1135 (93.8 percent)
of the cases reported this year, with the
remaining 75 reported cases in 10 countries
related to importations from Nigeria and India
(see below). From the newswire in [1] above, it
appears as though an additional 11 cases have
been identified in Pakistan in the past few days
since the weekly global statistics on polio cases was compiled.

Total cases: Year-to-date 2008 / Year-to-date 2007 / Total in 2007
Globally: 1210 / 497 / 1315
- in endemic countries: 1135 / 433 / 1208
- in non-endemic countries: 75 / 64 / 107

The tragic event in Afghanistan involving the
killing of polio eradication team workers is hard
to reconcile. This moderator agrees with the
statement on the polio eradication website, "This
tragic incident -- and recent armed attacks which
injured 2 polio workers in Somalia -- are stark
reminders of the sacrifices made daily by public
health and humanitarian workers around the world.
We mourn our colleagues and acknowledge the
courage and devotion of all those who are working
in difficult and dangerous circumstances to make
the world a better place for children." - Mod.MPP]
