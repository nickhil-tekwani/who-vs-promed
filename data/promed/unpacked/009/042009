Bacterial disease near Fort Collins
-----------------------------------------
Larimer County health officials have warned hunters and hikers to take
precautions after an outbreak of the bacterial disease tularemia north
of Fort Collins. The disease was found in dead wild rabbits on one
rural property in the Owl Canyon area.
Tularemia can be fatal if untreated. It is sometimes transmitted to
humans through infected wood ticks and deer flies, contaminated
drinking water, inhaled contaminated dust, or an animal bite. Symptoms
in humans include an ulcer-type lesion and enlarged, painful glands
near an insect bite. Symptoms can also include sore throat, intestinal
pain, vomiting, and diarrhea if the infection was contracted through
food. Inhaling the organism might produce fever and pneumonia.

[Hunters can get infected from skinning and eviscerating infected
rabbits. Therefore, to avoid Darwinian selection they should avoid
shooting sick-looking rabbits and treat any unexplained retrieved dead
rabbits with extreme caution. - Mod.MHJ
