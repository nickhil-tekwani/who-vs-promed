MILWAUKEE, Wisconsin.
A [recent report in the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel [indicated thatthe
source of the _Cryptosporidium_ that contaminated Milwaukee's water supply
in 1993, sickening more than 403,000 people and contributing to the deaths
of more than 100, was never identified, but cattle had been the prime
suspects.
Ben Beard, a parasitic disease expert with the US Centers for Disease
Control, was cited as saying that new studies now suggest that human waste
in city water drawn from Lake Michigan was the source of the outbreak in
March and April of 1993.

[Because of the importance of this large outbreak of cryptosporidiosis and
the amount of time that has transpired since the outbreak, ProMED-mail
contacted CDC officials to learn more about these reported new findings.
The results described were now possible because of genetic typing methods
that have improved since 1993. - Mod.ES

When we wrote the New England Journal of Medicine article regarding our
investigation [N Engl J Med, 1994 Jul 21, 331:3, 161-7 we made it clear
that there was no evidence that suggested one source over another. I quote
from the article, "The source of the oocysts leading to the outbreak in
Milwaukee and the timing of their entrance into Lake Michigan remain
speculative. Possible sources include cattle along two rivers that flowed
into the Milwaukee harbor, slaughterhouses, and human sewage." Nowhere
will you find the original investigators focusing on cattle as the source.
In the present article on genotype 1 and genotype 2 of Cryptosporidium we
do not conclude that the Milwaukee outbreak was caused by a human source.
Ben's [Ben Beard's laboratory tested only four isolates that were
available from the Milwaukee outbreak. They were genotype 1 which TO DATE
has only been found in humans. These findings, based on so few specimens,
allow scientists only to suggest that the outbreak was from a human source.
There is nothing absolutely conclusive about the results.

[Thanks very much to Bill Mackenzie for definitive information. Even
though we make an effort to substantiate reports that appear on
ProMED-mail, we trust that subscribers will follow the most important rule
i.e. the "Caveat Reader rule". The posting above illustrates how the
ambiguities inherent in the scientific disciplines underlying public health
can become simplified and then distorted into half truths in the wrong
hands. In this case, there was such an overwhelming buzz in the media that
dairy farms "were a potential source" or "could possibly be involved" that
they soon became the culprit despite a very clear, authoritative stance
that there were several potential sources of the water contamination with
cryptosporidia. Now, Bill MacKenzie who headed the investigation at CDC,
finds SOME evidence that a human source MAY have been involved. Once
again, someone choose to look at this new evidence and reach a definite
either/or conclusion rather than live with the ambiguity or do the research
to settle the matter. No wonder confusion sometimes reigns in the public's
mind. Let me remind everyone that in epidemiology, just as in coffee
drinking, there is many a slip between the cup and the lip. - Mod.PC
