1st responders rushed to a Dayton, [Ohio], elementary school Wednesday morning [31 Oct 2018] after some children became sick after reportedly eating candy. Medics and police were called to Belle Haven Elementary school on Free Pike around 11:30 a.m.

A school resource officer called 911, reporting 3 students were feeling woozy after eating candy. According to the caller, the candy had been brought to school and "may have been laced with something."

After investigating the matter, it was determined that the candy brought in was actually over-the-counter melatonin gummies that were brought to school by another student.

Dayton Public Schools [DPS] says 2 of the students started feeling ill, and paramedics were called. After learning the "candy" was melatonin gummies, paramedics determined the children did not need to be taken to the hospital. DPS says it was an isolated incident, and no other students were involved.

[Melatonin, which occurs naturally in the body and is involved in the natural regulation of sleep, is also sometimes used as a dietary supplement to help people sleep. Like other dietary supplements, there are few studies that have examined its effectiveness. Toxicity from melatonin appears to be mild. Dietary supplements in the USA are not regulated as drugs (https://www.poison.org/articles/2015-sep/melatonin).

Even though administration of melatonin in humans, as well as in animals (even at supraphysiological doses), has not shown evidence of toxicological effects, several features specific to this neurohormone need to be taken into consideration. Whatever the species concerned, melatonin is secreted during the night; it is the "hormone of darkness." It presents a circadian rhythm and a circannual rhythm (in photoperiodic species). The duration of these secretions could have an impact on the reproductive system, for example, showing the importance of the pharmacodynamics of melatonin. An inappropriate time schedule of melatonin administration could induce supraphysiological concentrations of the neurohormone and a desensitization (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9406047).

This would help explain why the students, getting essentially an overdose of a sleep hormone in the morning, were dizzy, groggy, and woozy. The melatonin levels were likely higher than expected after consuming multiple gummies. There is no indication in this article of how many gummies each student ate, but it was likely it was more just a few. It is likely these students either slept off the effects of the melatonin or recovered quite quickly. - Mod.TG
