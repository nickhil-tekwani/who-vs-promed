Hog Cholera Spreading to 18 Regions
------------------------------------
Further outbreaks of hog cholera were detected yesterday at 5 farms in
Wanju, Kimje, and Iksan of North Cholla Province, and in Haman of South
Kyongsang Province, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry said. By turn,
the areas where outbreaks have been identified increased to 35 farms in 18
cities and counties in 6 provinces, according to the ministry.
However, the outbreak is expected to spread rapidly, since 3 of 55 hogs in
a livestock artificial insemination center in Kimje, North Cholla Province
tested positive yesterday for the porcine disease, according to the ministry.
A livestock farming company Sangwon Pig Development Co. in Kimpo, Kyonggi
Province has also identified as the origin of the virus as it sold 840
breeding pigs that were thought to be infected. The ministry said Sun, 23
Mar 2003, that it will file a complaint against the farming company.
So far, some 29 370 of 53 880 pigs raised at the farms in question have
been slaughtered in an effort to contain the disease. The ministry has
vaccinated some 2.28 million hogs, or 67 percent of the 3.42 million at or
near the farms, with anti-cholera vaccine.

[The continuing spread of Classical Swine Fever (CSF) in Korea is alarming.
In December 2002 the government decided to adopt "the only measure that can
quickly prevent the spreading of the disease among hogs" - vaccination of
pigs reared within a 10-kilometer radius of the outbreaks. (see ref
20021228.6145).
In Korea's last notification to the OIE -- Follow-up report No. 4 of 3 Jan
2003 -- the authorities informed that "the emergency vaccination (ring
vaccination) policy for pigs has been applied since 25 Dec 2002 in the
affected cities and counties (Gimpo, Incheon, Gwanghwa, Icheon, Seogu) and
the vaccinated animals have been marked". It seems now that these measures
have not been sufficient.
CSF, also known as hog cholera, is a contagious List A viral disease of
pigs. The causative virus is a member of the genus Pestivirus of the family
Flaviviridae. There is only one serotype of CSF virus.
The disease may run an acute, subacute, chronic, or inapparent course,
depending on a variety of viral and host factors of which the age of the
animals, the virulence of the virus and the time of infection (pre- or
post-natal) are of greatest importance. Adult pigs usually display less
severe signs of disease than young animals and stand a better chance of
survival. In pregnant sows, the virus may cross the placental barrier and
reach the fetuses. In utero infection with strains of the virus of moderate
or low virulence can result in what is referred to as the "carrier sow"
syndrome followed by prenatal or early post-natal death, the birth of
diseased piglets, or an apparently healthy but infected litter. An outbreak
of CSF has serious consequences for trade in pigs and pig products, causing
severe economical losses. Further details on CSF, its diagnosis and the
vaccine, are available in chapter 2.1.13. of OIE's Manual of Standards for
Diagnostic Tests &
Vaccines.<http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00034.htm>CSF does not
affect humans.
