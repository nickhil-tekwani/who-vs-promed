From: Claudio Betts <claude@nueva-era.org>

I received the following message from the Chief Epidemiologist of the
Ministry of Health of Panama (Dr. Mosca):
There has been an increase in the number of shigellosis cases diagnosed at
the Children's Hospital and at the Pediatric Ward of the Social Security
Hospital of the City of Panama during the first quarter of this year with
respect to the same period of 1999. However, laboratory confirmation of
clinical cases suspect of shigellosis has been intensified as compared to
previous years.

In the Children's Hospital, the confirmed cases have been of _S. flexneri_
and _S. sonnei_.
In the Pediatric Ward of the Social Security Hospital, there have been two
confirmed cases of _S. dysenteriae_ and the rest have been _S. flexneri_
and _S. sonnei_.
