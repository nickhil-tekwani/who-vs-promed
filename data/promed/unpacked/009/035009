BLUETONGUE - EUROPE (12): BTV-8, GERMANY, NOT, FINAL

Regarding ProMED-mail posts "Bluetongue - Europe" (10) and (11),
please find below a statement by the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut,
Federal Research Institute for Animal Health, which should finally
clarify the issue in question:
1. A cross-sectional study (CSS) was performed in those regions of
Germany that had been affected last year [2006] by bluetongue disease
(BT), as described in the "Working Document on Bluetongue monitoring
and surveillance in the EU (European Union)"
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/bluetongue_wd_en.pdf>.
Not surprisingly, this resulted in the identification of a
substantial number of seropositive cattle. The results of the CSS
were used to identify sentinel animals, which were selected based on
negative BT serology and PCR (polymerase chain reaction).
2. After the CSS, the sentinel program started. Sentinels are tested
once a month. So far, there have been reports about 2 sentinels that
were suspected to have tested positive for BT. However, further
investigations of the identity of the samples and the animals they
were derived from (including genetic identification of the respective
animals or samples, respectively), led to the conclusion that the
pairs of samples giving rise to the suspicion of a new infection were
derived from different animals. This indicates that either the
samples or the animals were mixed up. As a consequence, the results
do not indicate that new infections with BT have occurred, so far, in 2007.

Results of the monthly sentinel tests are anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS]
