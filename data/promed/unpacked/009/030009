I - Evolution of the pandemic

North America

In the United States (1), the traditional influenza season ended in
EW 20. In EW 23, the proportion of outpatient consultations for
influenza-like illness (ILI) continued to remain below the national
baseline, and all sub-national surveillance regions reported the
proportion of outpatient visits for ILI to be below their
region-specific baseline. The proportion of deaths attributed to
pneumonia and influenza was below the epidemic threshold. No
influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported this week.

Caribbean

Jamaica reported widespread influenza activity; Cuba reported
regional influenza activity; and Dominica and Dominican Republic
reported no influenza activity. Cuba reported a decreasing trend in
acute respiratory disease, while the other 3 countries reported an
unchanged trend. All of these countries reported low/moderate
intensity of acute respiratory disease and low impact of acute
respiratory disease on health care services.

Central America

Panama reported no influenza activity, an unchanged trend in acute
respiratory disease, low/moderate intensity of acute respiratory
disease, and low impact of acute respiratory disease on health care services.

South America

Andean

Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela reported regional influenza
activity, while Ecuador reported no influenza activity. Bolivia
reported a new increasing trend in acute respiratory disease, while
Colombia and Venezuela have reported 2 and 3 consecutive weeks of
increasing trends in acute respiratory disease, respectively. Ecuador
and Peru reported unchanged trends in acute respiratory disease. All
countries reported low/moderate intensity of acute respiratory
disease and low impact of acute respiratory disease on health care services.

In Bolivia (2), nationally, the number of cases of acute respiratory
infection (ARI) remained within the endemic channel, however, in the
department of Pando, the number of ARI cases passed the epidemic
threshold in EW 23.

In Peru (3), in EW22, nationally, the number of pneumonia cases in
children under 5 years of age was below the epidemic threshold, while
in the southern department of Moquegua, it was above the threshold.

Southern Cone

Brazil and Chile reported regional influenza activity, unchanged
trends in acute respiratory disease, and low/moderate intensity of
acute respiratory disease.

In Chile (4), nationally, consultations for ILI remained low and
within the endemic channel. At the regional level, 10 regions
reported low ILI activity, one reported moderate ILI activity, one
reported high ILI activity, and 3 reported no ILI activity.
