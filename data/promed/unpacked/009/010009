Russia: High Rabies Risk in Moscow
----------------------------------
Moscow must cut its stray dog population to stop the spread of rabies, a
top doctor said on Tuesday [26 Jul 2005], the day after an 8-year-old girl
died of the disease in a region east of the capital. Gennady Onishchenko,
Head of the Public Health Agency and Russia's top public health doctor,
said 11 Russians had died of rabies in the first 6 months of 2005.
Rabies is incurable once symptoms develop and causes an exceptionally
painful death. It is spread by the bites of infected animals -- most
famously by "mad dogs" or by blood-sucking bats. "The situation in the
Moscow region is very worrying ... (in one region of the city alone) we
have had 3 cases of rabies, and therefore 3 fatalities," said
Onishchenko. "Naturally we are most concerned about domestic animals. In
Moscow 2 years ago, 340 000 stray dogs were registered."
He spoke as the town of Gus-Khrustalny [transliterated as Goose-Khrustalniy
in the preceding post], 200 kilometres (124 miles) from Moscow in the
Vladimir region, imposed a quarantine on pets after the young girl died,
local media reported. "Up to 10 people a day have been contacting us
because of rabies, mainly with bites, scratches, and contact with
non-vaccinated animals," Igor Matveyev, the main health official in
Gus-Khrustalny said in comments on state television. "The vaccine is very
expensive; the hospital is experiencing colossal losses."
Rabies statistics are hard to come by, and the World Health Organisation
estimates the number of deaths at 40 000 to 70 000 a year worldwide. Rabies
has been all but eradicated in much of the Western world, and Russia lags
behind countries like the United States, where official figures report only
1-2 deaths a year. Some Russian officials have suggested a cull of stray
dogs to halt the spread of rabies, but Onishchenko called for calm.
