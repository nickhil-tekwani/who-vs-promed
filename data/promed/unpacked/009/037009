Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 - WHO update 65
------------------------------------
Weekly update:
--------------
In the temperate region of the southern hemisphere (represented by
countries such as Chile, Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, and South
Africa), influenza activity continues to decrease or return to baseline.

Active transmission persists in tropical regions of the Americas and
Asia. Many countries in Central America and the Caribbean continue to
report declining activity for the 2nd week in a row. However,
countries in the tropical region of South America (represented by
countries such as Bolivia, Ecuador, and Venezuela) are reporting
increasing levels of respiratory disease. In the tropical regions of
Asia, respiratory disease activity remains geographically regional or
widespread but the trend is generally increasing as noted in India,
Bangladesh, and Cambodia.

In the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere activity is
variable. In the United States, regional increases in influenza
activity are being reported, most notably in the south-eastern
states. Most of Europe is reporting low or moderate respiratory
diseases activity, but parts of Eastern Europe are beginning to
report increases in activity.

WHO Collaborating Centres and other laboratories continue to report
sporadic isolates of oseltamivir-resistant influenza virus. 21 such
virus isolates have now been described from around the world, all of
which carry the same H275Y mutation that confers resistance to the
antiviral oseltamivir but not to the antiviral zanamivir. Of these,
12 have been associated with post-exposure prophylaxis, 4 with long
term oseltamivir treatment in patients with immunosuppression.
Worldwide, more than 10 000 isolates of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009
virus have been tested and found to be sensitive to oseltamivir. WHO
will continue to monitor the situation closely in collaboration with
its partners, but is not changing its guidelines for use of antiviral
drugs at this time.

Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus continues to be the predominant
circulating virus of influenza, both in the northern and southern
hemisphere. All pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza viruses analysed to date
have been antigenically and genetically similar to
A/California/7/2009-like pandemic H1N1 2009 virus. See below for
detailed laboratory surveillance update.

Of note, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
this week reported on an analysis of 36 fatal pandemic influenza
cases in children under the age of 18 years. 67 percent of the
children had one or more high-risk medical conditions, most commonly
neurodevelopmental disorders. In addition, 10 of 23 children for whom
data were available were found to have strong evidence of secondary
bacterial co-infections.

Weekly update (Virological surveillance data):
----------------------------------------------
As of 11 Sep 2009, The Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN)
continues monitoring the global circulation of influenza viruses,
including seasonal viruses. Since the beginning of the pandemic in 19
Apr 2009 to 29 Aug 2009, a total of 80 countries reported to FluNet.
The total number of specimens reported positive for influenza viruses
by NIC laboratories was 93 628. Of these, 56 812 (60.7 percent) were
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, 5429 (5.8 percent) were seasonal A (H1),
12 476 (13.3 percent) were A (H3), 15 326 (16.4 percent) were A (not
subtyped) and 3585 (3.8 percent) were influenza B.

For this reporting week (23 - 29 Aug 2009); a total of 26 countries
reported to FluNet. The total number of specimens reported positive
for influenza viruses by NIC laboratories was 5640. Of these, 4294
(76.1 percent) were pandemic H1N1 2009 virus, 139 (2.5 percent) were
seasonal A (H1), 696 (12.3 percent) were A (H3), 476 (8.4 percent)
were A (not subtyped) and 35 (0.4 percent) were influenza B. On
average, the pandemic (H1N1) accounted for 76 percent of all
influenza detections. Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus continues
to be the predominant circulating virus of influenza, both in the
northern and southern hemisphere.

All pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza viruses analysed to date have been
antigenically and genetically similar to A/California/7/2009-like
pandemic H1N1 2009 virus.

guidance on global surveillance: see,
<http://gamapserver.who.int/h1n1/cases-deaths/h1n1_casesdeaths.html>

Region Cumulative Total as of 6 Sep 2009 / Cases* / Deaths

WHO Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) / 6336 / 35
WHO Regional Office for the Americas (AMRO) / 120 653 / 2467
WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean (EMRO) / 9844 / 51
WHO Regional Office for Europe (EURO) / Over 49000 / At least 125
WHO Regional Office for South-East Asia (SEARO) / 22387 / 221
WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific (WPRO) / 69 387 / 306
Total / Over 277 607 / At least 3205

*Given that countries are no longer required to test and report
individual cases, the number of cases reported actually understates
the real number of cases.
