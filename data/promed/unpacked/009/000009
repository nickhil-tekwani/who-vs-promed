Some historical information on autochthonous dengue in the
continental United States and Hawaii.
Dengue was first reported in the United States in 1827. A major
epidemic in 1850 involved the southeastern states. 40 000 were infected
in New Orleans in 1873, and a subsequent epidemic was reported
during 1879 to 1880.
50 000 cases occurred in Hawaii in 1903. 1496 cases (3 fatal) were
reported in Honolulu in 1943.
One to 2 million cases were estimated for the southern states during the
1930's.
The last dengue epidemics in Florida (Tampa and Miami areas)
occurred 1934-35 and affected an estimated 15 000 persons in Miami
(11.1% of the city's population).
The last continental epidemic occurred in Louisiana (approximately 243
cases -- 106 officially reported) in 1945. No autochthonous cases were
reported for the United States during 1980 to 1985.
Epidemics were registered in Texas in 1885 and 1897. Texas reported
40 000 cases (true number estimated at 500 000 to 600 000) during a
statewide epidemic in 1922. 526 cases were reported in Texas in 1941;
10 in 1986; 0 during 1987 to 1994; 29 in 1995 (including 4 acquired in
Hidalgo County and 3 in Cameron County); 0 in 1996. Three cases
were acquired in Texas (Cameron and Hidalgo Counties) in 1997; one
in 1998 (Cameron County).
Texas reported 55 cases (1 fatal) in 1999 (28 in Webb County; others in
Bexar, Cameron, Dallas, Galveston, Hidalgo, Nueces, Starr, Tarrant,
Travis, and Willancy Counties) -- including 16 autochthonous cases
and 35 imported (30 from Mexico and one from Brazil). Through
active case-finding, 11 additional cases (9 imported from Mexico, 2
autochthonous) were diagnosed in Laredo during 1999. No positive
cases were reported from Laredo in 2000.
