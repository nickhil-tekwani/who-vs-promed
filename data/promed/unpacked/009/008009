[The Israeli Veterinary Services produce monthly reports on the
occurrence of ex-list A diseases, which are distributed to the OIE
and to countries with which Israel maintains bilateral veterinary
agreements. The following information, related to Lumpy Skin Disease
(LSD), has been retrieved from the November 2007 report, issued 8 Dec
2007. - Mod.AS]

1. Location: EREZ, Hadarom region, Beer Sheva district, 34.57
longitude, 31.56 latitude [This is a Kibbutz settlement with 2 bovine
operations: A non-grazing dairy herd, and a beef herd which includes
grazing units. - Mod.AS].

Continuation of the outbreak reported on July 2007.

The outbreak occurred 1st in a free grazing [beef] herd. The herd was
vaccinated with sheep pox vaccine about 6 months before the outbreak.
In the milk herd nearby, which was not affected since the middle of
August 2007, the outbreak is continuing.

a. Beef herd (No new cases in November 2007):
[Accumulated since the start of the outbreak:] Susceptible - 235.
Cases - 97. Deaths - 0. Destroyed - 97.

b. Milk herd (4 new cases in November 2007):
[Accumulated since the start of the outbreak:] Susceptible - 520.
Cases - 43. Deaths - 0. Destroyed - 43.

Diagnosis was made by clinical signs. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
(Kimron Veterinary Institute) is in process.

Immediate movement control and quarantine were applied, and
revaccination of all the susceptible animals with sheep pox vaccine
in a radius of 10-km was carried out.

2. Location: DOROT, Hadarom region, Ashkelon district, 34.65
longitude, 31.50 latitude.
New outbreak.
The outbreak occurred in a milk herd.
Susceptible: 550. Cases: 2. Deaths: 0. Destroyed: 2.
Diagnosis was made by clinical signs and polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) (Kimron Veterinary Institute).

Immediate movement control and quarantine were applied, and
revaccination of all the susceptible animals with sheep pox vaccine
in a radius of 10 km was carried out.

[Israel has sent during 2007 6 reports pertaining to LSD, as follows:
13 Jun 2007 Immediate Notification
21 Jun 2007 Follow-up Report 1
1 Jul 2007 Follow-up Report 2
24 Jul 2007 Follow-up Report 3
18 Aug 2007 Follow-up Report 4
6 Nov 2007 Follow-up Report 5

For the above 6 reports with map, see
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=5568cvoBulgaria>.

All 7 outbreaks (initially in Alumim, followed by Or-Haner, Havat
Shikmim, Yad Mordechai, Erez, Nir-Am and Dorot) have occurred within
a 10-km zone around the northern part of the Palestinian Gaza strip.
As stated in the 1st (immediate notification) report, "a couple of
weeks before the outbreak in ALUMIM, 2 outbreaks in the Gaza strip
were reported to the Israeli Veterinary Services by the Veterinary
Services of the Palestinian Authority. Sheep pox vaccines were
delivered, after request, to the Palestinian Authority." The disease
seems to have become endemic in the Gaza strip, most probably
introduced from Egypt.

In spite of vaccinations and revaccinations of all bovines within a
protection zone around the Gaza strip, the disease continues to
simmer, while the control methods applied are composed of 4 main
actions: quarantine and animal movement restrictions, "modified
stamping out" (culling only animals with clinical symptoms),
arthropod control, and vaccination. These steps have been helpful in
preventing, so far, the spread of the disease to other parts of the
country; however, its continued simmering is cause for concern.

The vaccine applied is a locally produced live attenuated vaccine
(sheep-pox RM/65 strain). Large quantities of the same vaccine have
been applied during recent years in sheep in Israel with inconclusive
results. For the incidence (villages affected) of sheep pox in Israel
between 1986-2006, see graph on page 20 of Israel's annual report for
2006, available on-line at
<http://www.vetserv.moag.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/2D2D95F5-C369-46C8-8EC1-34AFF5C68142/1808/report2006.pdf>.

The vaccine strain RM/65 was initially developed in the Razi
Institute, Tehran in 1965 and underwent experimental challenge trials
as well as large-scale field trials to test its efficacy; see
references. The studies suggested that doses of the reconstituted
lyophilized vaccine, containing 100 TCID50 viral particles, produced
-- in susceptible sheep -- resistance which may last beyond 24 months.

In view of the long period which has elapsed since the introduction
of the RM/65 vaccine to field use (1966), it would be advisable to
check its current potency, in sheep as well as in cattle, against
prevailing field strains of sheep pox and LSD. It would also be
useful to obtain available information from other countries where
this vaccine is used, particularly Iran, as to its current efficacy
in preventing sheep pox.
