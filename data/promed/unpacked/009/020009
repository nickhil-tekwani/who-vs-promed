From: "Terry and Andrea" <terand@sunbeach.net>

I am seeking information on the cases of infection of non-freshwater fish by
_Streptococcus iniae_. There was an outbreak in the southern Caribbean
[Barbados among reef fish which resulted in mass mortality of the fish and
I am interested in knowing whether there were similar outbreaks in
open/coastal waters or whether it has been confined to freshwater fish, so
far.

[I believe Terry means the cause of the reef fish outbreak is unidentified,
& sheÂ´s wondering whether it could have been due to _Strep. iniae_.
Please reply direct to Terry, copy to ProMED - Mod.JW
