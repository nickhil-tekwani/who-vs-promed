California poultry processors are losing more than $125,000 a week because
of the detection of Newcastle disease in a Fresno backyard flock of 48 game
hens.
The find triggered an embargo by the Hawaii Department of Agriculture on
the importation of game birds specifically from Fresno, but it also has
prompted a moratorium on imports of poultry meat from the state to six
countries. The greatest impact is on poultry processors in Merced and
Stanislaus counties. It's a six-month embargo by Russia that is having the
most impact, along with an indefinite quarantine by Japan. Less significant
are quarantines by Estonia, Morocco, New Zealand and Romania, said Mark
Looker of the Modesto-based California Poultry Industry Federation.
A spokesman for Zacky Farms, with operations in Fresno, said it does
limited business exporting to the six countries and anticipates little
impact from the trade restrictions.
The infected or exposed birds at the Fresno residence were destroyed and
the premises cleaned and disinfected in early June. The birds were 17 miles
from the nearest commercial poultry location, and an investigation by the
California Department of Food and Agriculture over a 56-block area in south
Fresno found no other infected birds.
Newcastle disease is not transferable to humans.
Poultry producers have cultivated a profitable market in Russia, which
prefers the dark meat that has limited appeal in the United States. Japan
long has been a valuable market for poultry processors. Exports to those
and the four lesser markets stopped upon discovery of the disease. The
trade loss to Russia -- which could ban the poultry for up to six months --
alone is estimated at $125,000 a week, according to the poultry federation.
California has a $ 450 million chicken meat industry with Merced and
Stanislaus counties raising 90% of the state's product. Poultry is
processed and sold by companies such as Livingston-based Foster Farms.
Processors fear other countries will take advantage of the Newcastle
discovery to halt U.S. exports, the USA Poultry & Egg Export Council said.
Processors believe that action is unnecessary because U.S. poultry exports
are frozen and Newcastle won't be passed from frozen poultry to live birds.
Processors also point out that Newcastle disease was not discovered in a
commercial flock.
"We have a strong prevention program, which prevented the problem from
spreading," said Kevin Herglotz of the California Department of Food and
Agriculture. "We moved in quickly, determined the problem, isolated it and
then eliminated it. "Like any animal disease, this posed a threat to
agricultural production and exports. It's been almost three weeks now and
it hasn't spread to other birds."
That pleases growers.
"You can't take chances with a disease like Newcastle," said Mary Harris,
who raises chickens near Merced. "If it were to spread, you'd have a
disaster."
Growers have a right to worry. A major Newcastle outbreak in 1971 led to a
quarantine of all poultry south of the Tehachapis, the killing of 12
million birds and an eradication bill of $56 million.
The current effort is expected to cost $56,000, assuming no more diseased
birds are found.

[That it has not apparently spread further is the good news. The outstanding
question is still where did it come from? NDV finger-printing is reasonably
exact and if there are adequate archival reference material to hand plus the
use of genebank sequences, it should be possible to get some indication of
likely sources to be checked out. Obviously, there is still more to come on
this outbreak. - Mod.MHJ
