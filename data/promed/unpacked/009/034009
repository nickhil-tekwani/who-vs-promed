*** Cases for which insufficient clinical information was provided.
**** Total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET
by state and local health departments.
Neuroinvasive Disease refers to severe disease cases, particularly
West Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis.
West Nile fever refers to typically less severe cases that show no
evidence of neuroinvasion.
West Nile fever is not currently on the list of nationally notifiable
diseases, and therefore, it is optional whether or not state health
departments report these cases to CDC. Click the above CDC site [URL
above] for further explanations of neuroinvasive West Nile virus
disease and West Nile fever.
Other Clinical includes persons with clinical manifestations other
than WN fever, WN encephalitis or WN meningitis, such as acute
flaccid paralysis. Unspecified cases are those for which sufficient
clinical information was not provided.
Total Human Cases Reported to CDC: These numbers reflect both mild
and severe human disease cases occurring since 1 Jan 2006 reported to
ArboNet by state and local health departments.
ArboNet is the national, electronic surveillance system established
by CDC to assist states in tracking West Nile virus and other
mosquito-borne viruses. Information regarding 2006 virus/disease
activity is posted when such cases are reported to CDC.

[The numbers of human cases appear to be continuing to slow in the
northern tier of states, probably due to the onset of colder weather,
with a corresponding reduction of mosquito vector activity. - Mod.TY]

weekly basis and are reported to the CDC ArboNET for the following 5
categories: wild birds, sentinel chicken flocks, human cases,
veterinary cases, and mosquito surveillance. Maps detailing
county-level wild birds, sentinel chicken flocks, human cases,
veterinary cases, and mosquito surveillance data are published each
week on the collaborative USGS/CDC West Nile virus website.

WN virus antibody-positive sentinel animals (birds and/or horses)
have been found in Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, Iowa,
Montana, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Utah and
Virginia. [Not every state has a sentinel program. - Mod.JW]
WN equine infections have been reported from Alabama, Arizona,
Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,
Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi,
Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New
York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon,

[As in the previous West Nile virus update (archive 20061027.3075),
this epidemiological bulletin from the Mexican Ministry of Health,
Office of the Director of Epidemiology, reports no cases of West Nile
virus infection in humans for all of 2006 through 7 Oct 2006 and none
in 2005. This seems unusual, given that numbers of cases in humans in
the border states of Texas, Arizona and California continue to mount.
ProMED-mail requests any available information on West Nile virus
surveillance from Mexico and from Central and South America. Any
information from this area similar to that provided in previous years
would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.TY]
