Shrimp and prawn growers in Negros Occidental have expressed fear over the emerging shrimp disease called the early mortality syndrome (EMS) or acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) recently detected in the province and other parts of the country, including Central Luzon, Bohol, and Cebu.

Raoul Flores, vice chairman of the Negros Prawn Producers Cooperative, said on [Mon 7 Mar 2016], that the persisting heat associated with El Niño has resulted in high water temperature and salinity, which increases the risk of AHPND in shrimp and prawn production areas.

Flores said AHPND is caused by the _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ bacteria, which jump from one species to another.

"The disease has already caused up to 70 percent drop in production in China, Thailand, Viet Nam, and Malaysia," Flores said, adding that this has caused fear among local producers since these countries, which possess advanced shrimp production technology, have not yet recovered.

Thailand used to produce 685 000 tons of shrimp per year 10 years ago, but since the disease hit in 2010, its production for 2015 was only 250 000 tons.

"AHPND is deadliest among other diseases, like the white spot," Flores said.

In Negros Occidental, AHPND initially hit 2 production areas sometime in June 2015, where slight El Niño effects were already felt. Flores said the disease was diagnosed and treated, but not eradicated.

As preventive measures, local shrimp and prawn producers have utilized various equipment in checking and monitoring the disease in at least 1000 hectares [2471 acres] of production areas in the province.

The prolonged dry spell has brought P 381.41 million (more than USD 8.3 million) worth of damage and production losses in crops and animals in Negros Occidental as of February [2016], including, P 163.31 million [about USD 3.5 million] in losses of sugarcane, the main crop of the province.

The Negros Prawn Producers Cooperative, comprised of about 60 members, have advised local producers to maintain ideal temperatures and water salinity in their ponds.

Negros Occidental, like General Santos City [South Cotabato], produces 30 percent of the country's total annual production of shrimp and prawns, next only to Central Luzon, which produces 40 percent.

Of the province's total production, about 95 percent is vannamei or whiteleg shrimp, and the remaining 5 percent is tiger prawn.

Since the shrimp industry is risky business, Flores said producers have monitored a huge drop in the number of member-producers from the initial 300 members now only about 60. Production areas also dropped by 3500 hectares [about 8650 acres].

In terms of exportation, the province supplies an average of about 18 000 tons per year to countries like US and Japan, forming part of the country's 60 000 to 100 000 tons of total exportation.

"We are still on the growing momentum, we have been inviting processors to come in. They want to operate year-round. However, our production period is only 6 months due to changing climate conditions," Flores added.

["Early mortality syndrome" (EMS), more technically known as acute hepatopancreatic necrosis syndrome (AHPNS), is a new disease that appeared in shrimp farms located in southern China and Hainan Island in 2010. By early 2011, it was also detected in Viet Nam and Malaysia.

The disease appears within 20 to 30 days of stocking ponds with postlarvae.

Mortalities can approach 100 percent in severely affected ponds, where diseased shrimp become lethargic and anorexic. Upon simple dissection, the hepatopancreas organs of the shrimp may appear atrophied and whitish with black streaks. Other signs include a soft, generally darker shell and mottling of the carapace.

In early 2013, the Aquaculture Pathology Laboratory at the University of Arizona was able to isolate the causative agent of AHPNS in pure culture. AHPNS has a bacterial etiology, which has been identified as a member of the _Vibrio harveyi_ clade, most closely related to _V. parahaemolyticus_. This bacterium is infected by a virus, known as a phage, which causes it to release a potent toxin.
