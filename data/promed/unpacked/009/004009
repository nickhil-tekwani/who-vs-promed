Washington: Death of Student in Skagit County
-------------------------------------------------
The death of a community college soccer player here marks the first known
case of hantavirus infection in Skagit County. A 21-year-old student at
Skagit Valley College died a week ago, just days after he was taken to a
hospital for vomiting and diarrhea.
State Health Department tests confirmed the presence of hantavirus, said
Peter Browning, director of the Skagit County Health Department. The
hantavirus infection is spread by the common deer mouse. "It's pretty rare
for this area," he said. "We knew it was in the mouse population a while
ago, and we can assume there were cases in the past, but none verified by a
lab."
County health department investigators hope to identify where [the
individual] may have been exposed to the virus. Because the disease cannot
be spread through human contact, local residents should not become alarmed,
Browning said. Migrant workers and people who work around barns where deer
mice could be present are among those most at risk for contracting the virus.
Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [is caused by Sin Nombre virus] and is
characterized by fever, chills, and severe muscle aches, followed by
difficulty in breathing and shortness of breath. Deer mice are the main
carriers of the deadly virus, which kills 40 percent of people infected. To
prevent the disease, wear gloves and a dust mask when cleaning a
rodent-infested area or a shed or cabin that has been closed up. Soak mouse
nests and droppings with a solution that is one cup bleach to 10 cups
water. Don't stir up any dust; use mops or rags soaked in the bleach solution.
