Mystery virus ravages UK frogs
------------------------------
Scientists say they are now certain that the disease that has killed
millions of British frogs is caused by a virus. The disease, which began in
south-east England, has crossed the Scottish border, hundreds of kilometres
to the north. Tom Langton, the director of the Froglife Trust, stated that:
"The ends of their limb extremities, their hands and feet, drop off, they
haemorrhage, open sores develop, they get thin and emaciated, and then they
die."
BBC Wildlife Magazine published the research showing that a virus is
responsible. The work of Froglife and the Institute of Zoology involved
investigation of more than 62 000 dead frogs. Writing in the magazine, Mr
Langton says one theory for the disease's origin is a change in the source
of imported goldfish. Until 20 years ago most goldfish imported to the UK
came from Italy, but since then Israel and the US have dominated the trade.
In the US, bullfrogs breed alongside the goldfish enclosures, and are often
attacked with shotguns to stop them competing for food pellets. Mr Langton
writes: "Bits of bullfrog could be eaten by a goldfish that is netted and
flown off for quick distribution to British garden centres."
"It's a complex situation and the exact causes are still not known. Slug
pellets, vehicle emissions, and changing weather patterns may play a role
in reducing frogs' resistance to the virus; the isolation of urban frogs
and in-breeding could also be a factor. More research is needed urgently."
Froglife says the disease was first seen to be increasing in suburban
London gardens in the late 1980s." Typically, adult frogs are seen to be
dying over several weeks, resulting in dozens, or even hundreds, of deaths,
"Reports of the virus reach a peak in July and August. Large-scale frog
mortalities also occur in late winter and are usually caused by a garden
pond freezing over, which can suffocate male frogs hibernating at the
bottom. We have found no evidence of the disease affecting people, pets or
other pond life; most people report that toads, newts and fish in a pond
where frogs are dying appear totally healthy."

[The virus implicated in this outbreak is a member of the genus _Ranavirus_
of the family _Iridoviridae_. Iridoviruses are large complex viruses
possessing a large double-stranded DNA genome, which infect a variety of
hosts. Iridoviruses have only been isolated from poikilothermic animals,
however, usually those inhabiting damp or aquatic environments, including
marine habitats. None are known to infect warm-blooded vertebrates.
Curiously, however, there is a weak amino acid sequence homology of the
major capsid protein with a corresponding protein of African swine fever
virus, a vertebrate virus of uncertain phylogeny - Mod.CP]
[Although reports concerning viruses, which are not associated with
outbreaks of disease in humans and domestic animals, are not normally
posted on ProMED-mail, the epidemiology of how this ranavirus gets
transported around the world is a lesson to us all. Today frogs, tomorrow ??
Frogs are eaten by humans, and the major trade, which is out of Southeast
Asia, could be used to explain some movement of _Vibrio cholerae_ 'El Tor'.
With the collapse of the US rural population we don't catch the number of
frogs that we used to, but the culinary demand for 'frog legs' is as high
as ever. Many years ago I had my students here in Louisiana study the
survival of _V. cholerae_ in frozen frog legs -- they do very nicely, thank
you -- It is the only paper in the literature on irradiated frog legs in
Louisiana. -

[The following background information on this outbreak has been supplied by
Dr Peter Daszak,Executive Director, Consortium for Conservation Medicine,
Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Palisades, New York 10964-8000, USA

The facts behind this story originate in the work of Dr Andrew A.
Cunningham, Head of Wildlife Epidemiology, Institute of Zoology, London and
Dr Alex Hyatt at CSIRO. Cunningham has been working on the UK frog
mortality events for a decade. His work convincingly implicates a ranavirus
(Genus _Ranavirus_ Family _Iridoviridae_) as the causative agent.
Ranaviruses have been isolated from a range of amphibian, fish, and reptile
hosts in America, Europe, Australia, and Asia.
Cunningham has published solid epidemiological data to support this. He has
also replicated clinical signs (skin ulceration and systemic hemorrhage)
experimentally and fulfilled Koch's postulates for a ranavirus isolate from
common frogs (_Rana temporaria_) (Phil Trans Roy Soc London B. 1996, 351:
1539-1557). This is an important disease. It is implicated in amphibian
population declines in the UK and has received a great deal of scientific
and public interest not least because of widespread mass die-offs and the
striking lesions (the feet don't strictly "drop off", but there often is
extensive necrosis of the digits).
The hypothesis that this is an introduced pathogen is based on a recent
phylogeny paper (Arch Virol 2000, 145: 301-331). Major coat protein DNA
sequences from UK ranavirus isolates (one from a common frog, the other
from a toad) group with sequences of isolates from North American
amphibians including the bullfrog (_Rana catesbeiana_), suggesting it could
have been introduced from North America.
The bullfrog is a recent introduction to the UK and is now resident there,
but the first reports of this easily noticeable disease pre-date the
bullfrog's introduction. Langton suggests goldfish may be involved, and
although this hypothesis seems like a tabloid dream, it also is not
unreasonable. The global trade in aquarium fish is huge: it represents the
largest live animal trade globally and the largest portion of the import of
live animals into the UK.
Many ranaviruses have a wide host range experimentally, and experimental
infections of fish with amphibian ranaviruses (and vice versa) have been
published. Another potential source of introduction is the significant pet
trade in amphibians. Of course, hand-in-hand with import of aquarium fish
is import of aquarium water and its constituent microbial flora and fauna.
Ranaviruses are generally hardy outside the host, especially at cool
temperatures, and previous authors have proposed transport on fishing nets,
by waterbirds, and during fish stocking as means of pathogen introduction
to new sites (reviewed in EID 1999, 5: 735-748). The dimensions of the
aquarium fish and amphibian pet trade, the hardiness of the virus, and lack
of knowledge of amphibian pathogens (let alone surveillance, quarantine and
control measures) all suggest that this hypothesis is worth testing, and
that the disease outbreaks in the UK may represent yet another example of
"pathogen pollution."]
