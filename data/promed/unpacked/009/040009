Sevastopol sanitary authorities in the Ukrainian autonomy of the Crimea
have closed the main city beach in Omega Harbour after cholera vibrio
[bacteria had been discovered in sea water.
Local doctors say there is no surprise that the vibrio were discovered in
Omega Harbour. The beach is overcrowded night and day, and "the sea does
not have time enough to purify itself."
However the public health authorities of the Crimean capital Simferopol
have expressed concern as a cholera-like vibrio has been found in city
reservoirs.

[The report does not mention which cholera vibrios have been identified.
The Black Sea is somewhat of a cesspit at the best of times as it receives
large volumes of minimally treated, if at all, municipal sewage from the
coastal cities plus the industrial waste contamination of the major rivers
emptying into the sea. - Mod.MHJ
