(_Vicia faba_) reported for the 1st time. BSPP New Disease Reports 2008; 17]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
During the period December 2005 to January 2006, unusual leaf
symptoms suggestive of a virus infection were observed in faba bean
(_Vicia faba_) in fields in the Gezira area and Northern parts of
Sudan. Symptoms in beans were coincident with a high level of crop
infestation by _Aphis craccivora_ that might play a role in the
transmission of the virus. Chlorotic mottling and/or mosaic symptoms
were accompanied by black streaks on stems and leaf petioles. In some
bean varieties, severe leaf chlorosis (Fig. 1) subsequently developed
into browning and blackening of the entire leaves (Fig. 2), resulting
in plant death (Fig. 3).

Extracts from bean leaves were mechanically inoculated onto a range
of host plants, and _Nicotiana benthamiana_ and _Chenopodium quinoa_
were identified as suitable propagation hosts. Electron microscope
analysis of leaf extracts from infected _C. quinoa_ revealed
virus-like particles with isometric particles approximately 30
nanometers in diameter.

A specific antiserum against the purified virus was produced, and the
size of the putative coat protein was estimated to be between 29 and
30 kDa. Using several reference viruses for a serological comparison,
the virus isolated from faba bean was found to be related to _Tobacco
streak virus_ (TSV), a virus that is a serious pathogen of groundnut,
sunflower, and okra in India.

The identity of the faba bean virus isolate was confirmed by reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequence
analysis. A comparison of the deduced 237 amino acid coat protein
sequence revealed between 90 and 92 percent sequence identity with
the coat proteins of TSV isolates from sunflower, cotton, and a
number of other crops in India. The closest relationship (98 percent
identity) of TSV from the Sudan was found with a TSV isolate from the
ornamental _Impatiens neuguinea_. An analysis of TSV isolates from
legumes including _V. faba_ revealed a 92 percent amino acid sequence
identity with a soybean isolate from India, and only a distant
relationship to a TSV soybean isolate from Brazil (83 percent). This
shows a distinct geographic distribution of the TSV isolates from
faba bean in Sudan.

To our knowledge this is the 1st report of the natural occurrence of
TSV in _V. faba_.

[_Tobacco streak virus_ (genus _Ilarvirus_] affects a number of
crops, including bean, sunflower, peanut, maize, soybean, and a range
of vegetable and ornamental species. It is probably distributed
worldwide and has been reported to be spreading in North America and
Oceania. It is transmitted by thrips vectors (_Frankliniella
occidentalis_ and _Thrips_ spp.), possibly by allowing virus from the
surface of infected pollen to enter through feeding wounds. Weed
species, for example _Parthenium_ species, may serve as pathogen
reservoirs and potential sources of infected pollen (see previous
ProMED-mail post no. 20070419.1289). TSV can also be transmitted by
mechanical inoculation and grafting, by pollen to the pollinated
plant, and it is seed-transmitted in some species to different
extents. It is not transmitted by contact between plants.

While this is the 1st report of a natural field infection of faba
beans with TSV, _V. faba_ has been reported previously as an
experimental host susceptible to mechanical inoculation. Furthermore,
aphids do not cause major feeding wounds like thrips and are not
known to transmit TSV, and therefore the _A. craccivora_ reported
above to have been present in the same crop are not likely to have
been involved as vectors. It appears that further work is needed to
elucidate the epidemiology of TSV in field crops of faba beans.
