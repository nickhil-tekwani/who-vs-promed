African Swine Fever in Zambia is Severe
---------------------------------------
Since the outbreak of African Swine Fever (ASF) in Zambia's
North-Western Province in December of last year [2007], more than
3000 swine have died of the infectious disease in the province.

According to a report of 8 Feb 2008 by Zambia News Agency, health
inspection agencies in North-Western Province have adopted preventive
measures, such as a ban on the sale of pork, in 5 areas affected by
the disease, and with the assistance of the central government and
European Union have proceeded with immunization of all livestock in
the province. [see commentary].

More than 85 percent of livestock in the province have now been immunized.
