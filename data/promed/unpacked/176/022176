Drum skin plea at anthrax inquiry
---------------------------------
The brother of a man who died after contracting anthrax has called
for tighter controls on the importation of potentially contaminated
drum skins. Michael Norris, 49, was speaking at the start of an
inquiry into the death of Christopher "Pascal" Norris.

The artist and woodworker, from the Scottish Borders, died on 8 Jul
2006. A report from NHS Borders concluded Mr Norris, 50, was likely
to have contracted the disease by playing or handling West African
drums. His was the 1st recorded death from anthrax in the UK for more
than 30 years. However, a drum-maker in east London died earlier this
month [November 2008] after inhaling spores while handling animal skins.

A fatal accident inquiry at Edinburgh Sheriff Court heard Mr Norris
was in remission from leukaemia when he died at his home in Stobs,
near Hawick, a few days after attending a drumming class in
Smailholm, near Kelso.

His brother Michael questioned the point of the inquiry before
Sheriff Principal Edward Bowen QC. He said: "As far as we know,
Pascal's inhalation of anthrax came from playing the drums,
admittedly with a compromised immune system. It seems a bit rich that
all this money is being spent on legal processes and no money is
being spent on telling drummers to watch out. The importation and
provenance in general of drum skins needs to be addressed to stop
people from dying." He told the inquiry that his brother had been in
good health when he last spoke to him a few weeks before his death,
although he complained of a sore finger.

He said his brother, a Buddhist and vegan, lived a healthy lifestyle
and had plenty of energy. Mr Norris described his brother as
non-judgmental and "thoroughly likeable."

The inquiry also heard from Pascal Norris's friend and neighbour,
69-year-old John Godfrey. He said he remembered Mr Norris feeling
feverish on Wednesday but better the following day. However, he said
on the Friday he had noticed Mr Norris's door was open and went in to
find him very unwell. "He looked ghastly, very drawn," he said. "I
thought it was probably a result of the fever and thought he should
see a doctor immediately." He took him to see a doctor who
immediately called an ambulance to take him to hospital but he died
later that night.

[This report points up a possible host risk factor in that he was in
remission for acute myeloid leukemia. The previous ProMED-mail
reports on this case (archives no. 20061122.3326 and no.
20070312.0877) are of interest in pointing up the contamination,
admittedly slight, of a local community centre used for drumming
classes. The centre was in active use for a wide range of local
events before and after Christopher Norris's death. I fear that
Michael Norris has a good point about the need to warn drummers about
the risks from purchasing and handling these African hides. - Mod.MHJ]
