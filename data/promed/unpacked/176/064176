[An] anthrax outbreak has killed dozens of cows during the last few days in [the] Karman area of the Kurram tribal district, triggering fear among the local residents. Talking to mediapersons here on Wednesday [24 Jul 2019], elders of the area said that the [bacteria] killed the cows within a short span of time.

The elders demanded of the government to take necessary steps to eradicate the disease forthwith. If not controlled in time, spread of the deadly disease to the adjacent areas cannot be ruled out, they feared.

When contacted, senior veterinary officer Mazhar Ali confirmed to Dawn the outbreak of anthrax [bacteria] in the area. "We have vaccinated cattle against anthrax in Karman area and have sent the blood samples of the affected cattle to Peshawar for laboratory test," he said, adding that a few years ago the [pathogen] had attacked central Kurram [see 31 Oct 2001 Anthrax, livestock - Pakistan (NWFP) 20011031.2692], but was successfully contained later.

["Anthrax" has yet to be confirmed, but there is no reason to doubt their suspicions. Obviously any vaccination programme stimulated by the previous outbreaks in Kurram had fallen by the wayside. The wording in this report indicates that control then was not immediate but took some effort.

Kurram District is a district in Kohat Division of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurram_District. Until 2018, it was an agency of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA); with the merger of FATA with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, it became a district. Geographically, it covers the Kurram Valley region, which is a valley in the northwestern part of Pakistan. Until the year 2000, when the old divisions were abolished, the Kurram District used to be part of the Peshawar Division of the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan. - Mod.MHJ
