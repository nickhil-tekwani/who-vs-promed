A 2 years & 6 months old bird-flu suspect has been referred to Arifin
Achmad General Hospital in Pekanbaru after receiving several days of
treatment at Ibnu Sina Hospital. Arifin Achmad Hospital's bird flu
response team coordinator Azizman Saad said the patient had to be
referred to his hospital because the symptoms of bird flu he displayed
-- high fever, breathing difficulties and coughing -- had not abated.

"Not only did his fever reach 40 C when he arrived at the hospital,
but he also displayed all the signs of someone suffering from bird
flu. Preliminary tests also showed a high amount of liquid in his
lungs. The patient is still being treated in the bird flu isolation
ward and still holds the status of suspect," Azizman told The Jakarta
Post on Tuesday [24 Mar 2009]. The hospital has sent liquid and blood
samples to the Health Ministry's Medical Health and Development
Center in Jakarta.

[I am curious about the assertion that bird flu can be diagnosed
clinically. I should have thought it would be impossible to
distinguish it from any other severe case of influenza. - Mod.JW]
