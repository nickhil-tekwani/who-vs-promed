Concerning the health status of the Beni population, it is certain
that there have been deaths due to hemorrhagic fever and that there
are other infectious diseases present, such as dengue, although there
is no official information concerning human losses due to these diseases.
The [government] of the United States signed an agreement with the
Bolivian government that guarantees the delivery of medicine to stop
the outbreak of hemorrhagic fever and dengue.

Diseases related to flood waters have cost 2 additional lives.
Yesterday [7 Mar 2007], the Minister of Health reported that 2 people
died of hemorrhagic fever in the Magdalena Municipality (the capital
of the Itenez Province of the Beni), located approximately 400 km
northeast of Trinidad.
This outbreak involved cowboys and workers on the Guamaha ranch,
where 6 cases have been reported. Two of these cases died, and the
others were taken to Trinidad to receive medical attention.

[It is not clear from these reports whether the reported hemorrhagic
fever is caused by Macuhpo virus (the etiological agent of Bolivian
hemorrhagic fever) or is dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Machupo
virus is endemic in lowland, tropical Bolivia in the rodent _Calomys
callosus_. The Beni seasonally floods, especially severely this year
[2007], which drives the rodents to the higher areas where people
live. Lowland Bolivia is suffering a dengue outbreak as well (Archive
No. 20070213.0541), so it is not clear whether the hemorrhagic fever
cases are due to DHF or to Machupo virus infections. ProMED requests
information that may clarify the etiology of these cases. The control
strategies would be different for each: rodent control for Machupo
virus and dengue virus mosquito vector control for _Aedes aegypti_.
The news source El Nuevo Dia
<http://www.el-nuevodia.com/versiones/20070306_007026/nota_249_398700.htm>
reports on the severity of this year's [2007] floods in the Beni and
mentions the occurrence of diseases, including dengue and hemorrhagic fever.
