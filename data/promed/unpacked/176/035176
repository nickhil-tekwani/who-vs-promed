On 2 Mar 2011, the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks (KDWP)
announced that 10 deer from northwestern Kansas had tested positive
for chronic wasting disease [CWD], the same number as last year [2010]
although 2 of those deer were found in counties farther east than any
previous confirmations. These were animals taken by hunters in the
2010 hunting seasons.

6 confirmed cases of CWD deer were taken by hunters in Decatur County
and one each from Graham, Norton, Sherman, and Smith counties. The
Norton, Sherman, and Smith cases were firsts for those counties. The
cases included 9 white-tailed and one mule deer. This season's [2010]
testing results brings the total number of confirmed CWD cases in
Kansas to 40 since testing began in 1996. In total, 2503 animals were
tested for CWD for the 2010 deer seasons. Although most testing is
finished for the year, KDWP will continue testing some vehicle-killed
and sick or suspect-looking deer, as well as deer taken with
depredation permits, through 31 Jul [2011]. If US Department of
Agriculture funding is available, a new surveillance period will begin
[1 Aug 2011].

Annual testing is part of ongoing effort by KDWP to monitor the
prevalence and spread of CWD. The fatal disease was first detected in
a wild deer taken in Cheyenne County in 2005. 3 infected deer were
taken in Decatur County in 2007 and 10 tested positive in 2008, all in
northwest Kansas.

CWD is a member of the group of diseases called transmissible
spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). Other diseases in this group
include scrapie in sheep and goats, bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE or mad cow disease) in cattle, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in
people. CWD is a progressive, fatal disease that results in small
holes developing in the brain, giving it a sponge-like appearance
under the microscope. An animal may carry the disease without outward
indication (only 2 of the 40 positive animals showed signs) but in the
later stages, signs may include behavioral changes such as decreased
interactions with other animals, listlessness, lowering of the head,
weight loss, repetitive walking in set patterns, and a lack of
response to humans. Anyone who discovers a sick or suspect deer should
contact the nearest KDWP office.

"It must be noted that many signs of CWD are indicative of other
diseases," says KDWP wildlife disease coordinator Shane Hesting.
"Thus, a sick deer may or may not be infected with CWD. CWD is a
serious deer disease but is still a rare disease in Kansas. There is
no vaccine or other biological method that prevents the spread of CWD.
However, there is no evidence that CWD poses a risk to humans or
livestock in the natural environment."

Still, precautions should be taken. Hunters are advised not to eat
meat from animals known to be infected, and common sense precautions
are advised when field dressing and processing meat from animals taken
in areas where CWD is found. More information on CWD can be found on
KDWP's website at http://www.kdwp.state.ks.us or at the Chronic
Wasting Disease Alliance website at http://www.cwd-info.org..

[The finding of infected 2 deer in counties further east represents a
slight expansion of the disease. While the actual number of positive
deer remains the same as the previous level, it may provide insight to
know how many years it has remained at this level without an expansion
of territory. - Mod.TG]
