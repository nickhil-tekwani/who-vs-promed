Adopted Baby's Cough Puts Travelers at Risk
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A Russian baby who was adopted by an American family exposed fellow
travelers to highly contagious whooping cough as he was flown to his new
home in the United States on 24 Apr 2002, said health officials at the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC.
The CDC said it has contacted other passengers on the flights and advised
those who sat near the child to take antibiotics if they will be near young
children. There has been no indication that anyone has been infected.
A U.S. Embassy spokeswoman said one of the doctors accredited by the
embassy to perform medical checks before visas are issued overlooked the
whooping cough, concluding the child had a common cold.
"The child was 9 months old and had not been vaccinated. Since the embassy
is allowed to waive those vaccinations, and the family signed an agreement
to have the vaccinations done in the U.S., the visa was issued," the
spokeswoman said in an e-mail response to questions.
In its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report last week, the CDC said the
adoptive parents picked up the child, described as 10 months old, from an
orphan ward at a hospital in Bryansk on 8 Apr 2002. They noticed he had a
cough, as did another baby in the same room.
On 24 Apr 2002, the baby flew with his adoptive parents from Moscow to New
York and on to Raleigh, North Carolina. On 26 Apr 2002, the baby was
diagnosed with whooping cough, and he and the parents have been treated,
the report said.
"CDC is collaborating with the U.S. Embassy, adoption agencies, visa
applicant medical clinics in Moscow, and the airline to identify anyone who
might have been exposed to the infant during his flights to North
Carolina," the report said. The CDC did not identify the airline or the
parents.
Whooping cough, also known as pertussis, is highly contagious, and can be
transmitted from personal contact and being close to an infected person who
is coughing and sneezing, according to the CDC web site.
Kristy Murray-Lillibridge, the doctor in charge of the CDC's response to
the case, said the disease is widespread in Russia and the United States.
Although the associated cough is easily recognized, a brief medical
examination could result in it being missed.
Airline passengers are reasonably safe from the spread of disease because
aircraft ventilation systems filter out infected air, she said Monday in a
telephone interview from Atlanta, Georgia.
The CDC has contacted all 11 people who sat within 2 rows of the infant and
his family during the flights, she said. The main concern had been that
they could infect other infants, but no other children were within the
2-seat range, she said. The flight to New York often has one or more
adopted children among the passengers.
Embassy staff and adoption agency staff and other children who had been in
the Bryansk hospital were alerted to the infection, she added.

[While this thread was closed yesterday, I'm exercising editor's
prerogative, as this newswire article does provide more information on the
background and vaccination history of the case discussed in the thread. In
addition, the CDC statement that "airline passengers are reasonably safe
from the spread of disease because aircraft ventilation systems filter out
infected air" has kept me busy tracking down the available data. In recent
years there have been 2 documented instances of transmission of
tuberculosis during airline flights (refs 1 & 6). In both instances
transmission was limited to close proximity to infected/contagious
individuals over a prolonged amount of time (greater than 8 hours). In
other instances there were skin-test conversions (a sign of infection with
_M. tuberculosis_) among airplane contacts, but results were inconclusive
as to whether the airplane contact was responsible for the skin test
conversion (as opposed to the person having been exposed prior to the
airline flight).
Other diseases that have been transmitted during airline flights include
influenza and measles. The National Academy of Sciences study on The
Airliner Cabin Environment and the Health of Passengers and Crew (2002)
(ref 5) discussed that while the risk of spread of disease was
theoretically there, it was more likely to be associated with droplet
infection with the usual observed spread of droplet infections in closed
environments. It did conclude that "Presence of some infectious agent is
likely, but the frequency of exposures that result in infection is not
known." and "Little information is available on the transmission of
infectious agents on aircraft."
