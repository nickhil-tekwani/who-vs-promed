In a follow-up report on _Vibrio vulnificus_ cases and deaths in Florida, state health officials are reporting 33 _V. vulnificus_ cases and 6 fatalities through [Fri 9 Sep 2022].

The cases are distributed as follows: Bay (3), Brevard (2), Broward (2), Charlotte (1), Citrus (2), Collier (2), Dade (2), Duval (1), Escambia (4), Flagler (1), Hernando (1), Highlands (1), Indian River (1), Jackson (1), Lee (2), Madison (1), Manatee (1), Okaloosa (2), Pinellas (1), and Santa Rosa (2) counties. Concerning fatalities, the 6 deaths were reported in Bay (1), Broward (1), Citrus (2), Escambia (1) and Highlands (1). The state saw 34 total _V. vulnificus_ cases and 10 deaths in 2021.

_Vibrio vulnificus_ can cause disease in those who eat contaminated seafood or have an open wound that is exposed to warm seawater containing the bacteria. Ingestion of _Vibrio vulnificus_ can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. _Vibrio vulnificus_ can also cause an infection of the skin when open wounds are exposed to warm seawater; these infections may lead to skin breakdown and ulcers. Healthy individuals typically develop a mild disease; however, _Vibrio vulnificus_ infections can be a serious concern for people who have weakened immune systems, particularly those with chronic liver disease.

The bacterium can invade the bloodstream, causing a severe and life-threatening illness with symptoms like fever, chills, decreased blood pressure (septic shock), and blistering skin lesions. _V. vulnificus_ bloodstream infections are fatal about 50% of the time. A recent study showed that people with these pre-existing medical conditions were 80 times more likely to develop _V. vulnificus_ bloodstream infections than healthy people.

[In high-risk individuals, the microorganism enters the bloodstream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50%). Over 70% of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions." (shown at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5508923/).

There are 2 points to be emphasized: (1) Vibrios are normal flora in warm salt water (not indicative of any sewage contamination), and (2) most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just develop gastroenteritis. The range of diseases due to _V. vulnificus_ may involve more northern geographical areas as overall global warming takes effect. - Mod.LL
