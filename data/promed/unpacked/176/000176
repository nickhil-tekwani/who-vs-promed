ENCEPHALITIS, TICKBORNE - SAUDI ARABIA

>From Jeddah, Saudi Arabia it was reported on 19 June 1997, that a new
strain of flavivirus was responsible for two deaths previously attributed
to a "mystery" disease. Blood samples of the two victims was tested at the
Dr. Solaiman Fakeeh Hospital and was subsequently confirmed by the US
Centers for Disease Control.
Symptoms of the disease are high fever, bleeding due to reduced platelets,
derangement of liver function, encephalitis and reduced white cell counts.
Dr. Mazim Fakeeh, who is the deputy director general and consulting
physician at the hospital said that the disease comes from contact with
animals during slaughter of infected sheep or consuming contaminated camel
milk. He also said that "ticks seem to act as a factor in transmitting the
disease."
[ProMED-mail has not been able to find any public information about this on
the CDC website; however, it sounds very much like tick-borne encephalitis
(TBE), which is caused by a flavivirus transmitted by ticks and through the
milk of domestic animals, and is not new, although it may be new to Saudi
Arabia -- GIDEON, please check?
Would any of our readers in Saudi Arabia or CDC care to clarify this
report? - Mod.JW]
