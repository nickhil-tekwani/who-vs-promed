An outbreak of a multi-drug resistant Heidelberg strain of _Salmonella_ has affected 54 people in 15 states, according to the CDC. The ongoing outbreak has progressed for some time, with associated illnesses dating back to January 2015. Since the last update on [Wed 2 Aug 2017], the CDC has reported 8 new cases in humans in 6 states [a map of the outbreak can be seen at the original URL - Mod.LL]. Up to 18 of the human cases in this outbreak, or 33 percent, are children under the age of 5 years.

The outbreak appears to have originated with dairy calves from Wisconsin. Of 54 patients CDC investigators have interviewed, 63 percent reported contact with dairy calves or cattle. Ongoing surveillance in veterinary diagnostic laboratories meanwhile, has found calves in several states with sickness associated with the outbreak strains of multidrug resistant _S._ Heidelberg. Animal-health officials currently are working to trace the origin of calves associated with the most recent human cases.

Investigators have used whole-genome sequencing to identify multiple antimicrobial resistance genes in outbreak-associated isolates from 43 ill people, 87 isolates from cattle, and 11 isolates from animal environments. They have also verified those findings with standard antimicrobial resistance testing methods used by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory on clinical isolates from 8 ill people in this outbreak. Those tests show:

- All 8 isolates were resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline, and had reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin.
- Up to 7 isolates were also resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
- A total of 5 were also resistant to nalidixic acid.
- Up to 3 were also resistant to chloramphenicol.
- All 8 isolates tested were susceptible to azithromycin and meropenem.

The CDC recommends the following preventative steps for veterinarians or producers working with cattle.
- Always wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water right after touching livestock, equipment, or anything in the area where animals live and roam.
- Use dedicated clothes, shoes, and work gloves when working with livestock.
- Keep and store these items outside of your home.

It is especially important to follow these steps if there are children under the age of 5 in your household. Young children are more likely to get salmonellosis because their immune systems are still developing.

[It appears that the source of the calves was Wisconsin. The number of cases in humans has more than doubled from 21 in November 2016 to 54 in November 2017.

It would be interesting to know the clinical response of the subgroup of this cohort who were treated with antimicrobials and how they responded to the therapy and if 2nd or 3rd line treatment was needed. Many cases of salmonellosis resolve without any therapy. - Mod.LL
