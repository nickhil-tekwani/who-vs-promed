Comments on BSE updates: 21 Nov 2000
--------------------------------------------
Following are some comments on Bovine Spongiform Encephalitis (BSE) in
Europe / Austria (based on information via radio and TV). The EC (European
Community) is actually discussing the introduction of obligatory checks of
all animals slaughtered.
This should not be restricted to countries where the occurrence of BSE has
been proven, but should be mandatory in all countries of the EC.
Austria, which has never had a case of BSE (nor a case of scrapie), stopped
using bonemeal and other animal parts for feeding cattle in 1991 and has
given the order to check every animal with symptoms similar to those of
"mad cow disease" for BSE.
On the other hand, it was said the EC actually DOES NOT PLAN to generally
ban feeding with bonemeal (which is said to be one of the highest risk
factors as far as I know).
I would very much appreciate an explanation on a rational basis.
