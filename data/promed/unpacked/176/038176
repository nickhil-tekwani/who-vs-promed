Thousands of apple growers in Kashmir are worried as scab and other related infections have engulfed their orchards. The infection has affected most of the apple orchards in north, south, and central Kashmir.

Dr. Zahoor Ahmad, Sheri-e-Kashmir Institute of Agricultural Sciences (SKUAST), said that most of the apple growers missed sprays due to wet weather and coronavirus lockdown. [He] said sub-standard fungicides can also lead to scab. "Spray schedules are very crucial. Some growers even used fungicides of their own choice. People should follow spray schedules and follow strictly advisories from the department to combat these diseases," he said.

Another scientist at SKUAST [said] that sub-standard fungicides play a vital role in spreading scab infection. "They should be tested before arriving in the market," he said.

[Scab disease (also called black spot) caused by the fungus _Venturia inaequalis_ affects apple, crab apple, loquat, and a few other related tree species. It is considered the most economically important disease of apples worldwide. Infected fruit is often unmarketable, and losses can be more than 70%. Symptoms may include dark leaf spots, premature leaf fall, and fruit lesions. Early infections often result in severely cracked and malformed fruit; they are most damaging since fruit becomes more resistant as it matures. Cracks in fruits may serve as entry points for other pathogens to cause rotting pre- or post-harvest.

The fungus overwinters in infected leaves on the ground. Spores are spread with infected plant material or by mechanical means or splashing rain and can be carried long distances in air currents. Disease management is expensive, requiring up to 12 fungicide sprays per year in areas where scab has become established. Apple cultivars vary in their susceptibility to scab. Resistant varieties are available, but few of them are currently suitable for commercial production.

The related species _V. pirina_ causes scab on pear with similar symptoms. The pathogens are specific to pear and apple, respectively, and cannot cross-infect the other's hosts. Other fungi in the same genus are known to cause scab diseases on different fruit crops.
