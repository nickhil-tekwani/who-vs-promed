Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1, Eurasian lineage goose/Guangdong clade 2.3.4.4b was confirmed on one commercial meat-type turkey premises in Dubois County, Indiana. Clinical signs included decreased water consumption, lethargy and increased mortality. State officials have quarantined the affected premises and depopulation of birds is underway. Movement controls have also been implemented. This is the first confirmed case of HPAI in commercial poultry in the United States since 2020. Comparisons of the virus to other recent detections from wild birds and North America reports are in progress. The USDA Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the Indiana State Board of Animal Health are conducting a comprehensive epidemiological investigation and have implemented enhanced surveillance and testing related to this finding.

Control measures at event level
Domestic control measures applied: zoning; quarantine; movement control inside the country; surveillance within containment and/or the protection zone; surveillance outside containment and/or the protection zone
Domestic control measures to be applied: disinfection; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; stamping out

Diagnostic test results

["This is the 1st confirmed case of HPAI in commercial poultry in the United States since 2020" (https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/newsroom/stakeholder-info/sa_by_date/sa-2022/hpai-indiana).

On 10 Feb 2022, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the US Department of Agriculture (APHIS-USDA) mentioned that "Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is a serious disease and requires rapid response because it is highly contagious and often fatal to chickens. APHIS works with its federal, state, local and industry partners to quickly mobilize a response to any HPAI findings. The goal is to quickly contain and eradicate the disease, protecting our poultry industry, and in turn, the American consumer." For more information of the current situation of HPAI in USA, see the following APHIS-USDA pages: Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/defend-the-flock-hpai and Confirmed HPAI findings in wild birds at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/2022-hpai. - Mod.CRD
