More horse owners considering rabies shots
------------------------------------------
Following a documented case of rabies in a Lea County horse earlier this
month [March 2006], area veterinarians are encouraging horse owners to get
their horses vaccinated. So far, officials from the New Mexico Department
of Public Health say the horse in Lea County is the only known rabies case
in a horse in the area, but it's best to err on the side of caution.
Chris Minnick, regional public information officer for the health
department, said the Lea County case should awaken some concern. "We just
have this one case," Minnick said, "but it serves to remind farmers and
ranchers and anyone who has domestic animals that rabies exists in the
area. We believe the horse was bitten by a wild animal, possibly a skunk."
A health department press release states that some Lea County residents
have reported wild skunks attacking livestock. Portales veterinarian, Dr
Kathryn Bartlett said no such reports have crossed her desk locally, but
she strongly recommends that Portales-area horse owners get their horses
vaccinated. "In the past few years, more people have become aware that
horses can get rabies," she said. "Rabies is not as common in horses as in
cats or dogs."
Minnick emphasized that rabies can be deadly to animals and humans. "A
horse can get bitten by a wild animal, and a human being can get rabies
from the horse. By protecting your animals, you are protecting yourself,"
Minnick said. "Vaccination is the key to preventing spread of the disease.
You can't prevent wild animals from coming into contact with domestic
animals in rural areas."
Veterinarian Dr Richard Mobley of the New Mexico Large Animal Hospital in
Clovis said it might not be economically feasible to vaccinate herds of
cattle, and there is no reason to expect large-scale rabies infestations of
cattle, but he said it is possible for cattle to be bitten by rabid
animals. "It's just not that common of a thing," Mobley said. "I can see
where horse owners might want to get their horses vaccinated, but I haven't
received any calls from horse owners since that rabies case (in Lea County).
Bartlett gave an example for horse owners to consider. She said if a horse
was choking, the horse owner would naturally want to stick his or her hand
in the horse's mouth to remove the obstruction. "But what if the horse had
rabies?" Bartlett asked. Mobley said the procedure for vaccinating horses
is the same procedure used for vaccinating cats and dogs. "There are 2
initial shots and then one every year," he said.

[This is a reminder that any mammal is susceptible to rabies. Rabies
vaccination is cheaper by far than risking contracting the usually fatal
disease.
Horses should be vaccinated for rabies [unless in countries free of rabies.
- Mod.SH]. Most owners or associates of the owners often hand feed their
animals and may be putting themselves at risk. Horses are naturally curious
animals and will put their noses to skunks and other small animals, and may
get bitten. Protecting them and yourself by vaccinating against rabies may
be prudent.
Depending upon the circumstances, it may be worthwhile to vaccinate cattle
as well. Vaccinations should especially be done in animals being prepared
for show, primarily because of the much closer, more frequent contact with
people. - Mod.TG]
