[It is striking that Canada, with only one-tenth of the population of
the USA, had roughly the same number of human cases
2035 vs 2307), and that not a single death has been reported this
year in Canada, whereas there have been 58 deaths in the USA -- see
below. - Mod.JW]

* cases with neurological manifestations (such as WN encephalitis,
meningitis*, and myelitis)
** cases with no evidence of neuroinvasion
*** cases for which insufficient clinical information was provided
**** total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET
by state and local health departments.
"Neuroinvasive disease" refers to severe disease cases, particularly
West Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis.
"West Nile fever" refers to typically less severe cases that show no
evidence of neuroinvasion. West Nile fever is not currently on the
list of nationally notifiable diseases, and, therefore, it is
optional whether or not state health departments report these cases
to CDC. [Further explanations of neuroinvasive West Nile virus
disease and West Nile fever can be found on the CDC website at the
URL provided above.]
"Other" includes persons with clinical manifestations other than WN
fever, WN encephalitis, or WN meningitis, such as acute flaccid paralysis.
"Unspecified" cases are those for which sufficient clinical
information was not provided.
"Total human cases reported to CDC:" these numbers reflect both mild
and severe human disease cases occurring since 1 Jan 2007, reported
to ArboNET by state and local health departments. ArboNET is the
national electronic surveillance system established by CDC to assist
states in tracking West Nile virus and other mosquito-borne viruses.
Information regarding 2007 virus/disease activity is posted when such
cases are reported to CDC.
