Farmers in Nabeul governorate are concerned about the spread of stripe rust that threatens wheat and fodder crops. They are dissatisfied because of the lack of agricultural guidance from official sources in the face of the spread of this disease.

Most grain farmers did not carry out treatment operations when spotting the disease in their fields due to the high prices of fungicides. There is a perceived need to strengthen agricultural extension services to improve yields and ensure quality of production. Farmers consider that it is not possible to save the season because the disease had not been noticed early enough.

The total area of grain production in Nabeul is estimated at 45 000 hectares, with wheat and durum wheat each representing around 20 percent of the area, while barley accounts for the rest.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_. The disease affects wheat (_Triticum aestivum_), durum wheat (_T. turgidum_), some barley varieties, triticale (wheat/rye hybrids), and a number of wild grasses. It causes yellow stripes on leaves, which leads to loss of photosynthetic ability and plant vigour, as well as stunting of plants. Yield losses of 40-100% have been reported in wheat.

Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season. Grasses and volunteer crop plants may generate a "green bridge," providing inoculum for the next crop cycle. Disease monitoring is important so that timely action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogen as well as build-up of inoculum. Disease management may include the use of resistant varieties, fungicide applications and control of pathogen reservoirs. Monitoring and resistance breeding programmes have been established in different regions for early detection of new rust strains and to attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution.

While stem rust (_P. graminis_) poses a huge potential threat to world wheat production, stripe rust is currently causing the most damage to wheat crops on a global scale. New strains of both rusts with increased virulence and additional fungicide resistances have been reported in recent years from wheat-growing areas worldwide. Climate warming allowing survival of wheat rusts on green bridges into higher latitudes is another example of pathogens extending their range due to climate change (e.g. ProMED posts 20141024.2895414, 20120809.1235745, 20090914.3230, and 20110718.2172). Projects for double-resistance breeding to manage both stripe and stem rusts simultaneously are in progress (see ProMED post 20120831.1274190).
