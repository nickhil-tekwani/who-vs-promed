Growing concern in Uruguay with Brazilian delay in FMD vaccination timetable
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Uruguay is concerned that in neighbouring Rio Grande do Sul, one of
Brazil's breadbaskets and famous for livestock breeding, the
vaccination campaign against foot-and-mouth disease remains
disturbingly delayed. With 10 days left for the end of the
vaccination period "only 20 percent of livestock has been immunized",
according to official sources from Porto Alegre.

Uruguayan sanitary officials are closely monitoring the Brazilian
situation and data from the compulsory vaccination campaign since the
north of Uruguay is exposed to Rio Grande do Sul livestock given the
porosity of the border, which has no major geographical barriers and
is an extension of South America's rolling plains.

Both Uruguay and the [Brazilian] state of Rio Grande do Sul are
considered free of FMD with vaccination by the World Organization for
Animal Health, a FAO dependency, which awards the crucial
certification to access the strictest markets.

Top quality beef is one of Uruguay's main export items. Brazil is
among the world's leading exporters of different meats (beef, pork,
and chicken).

Rio Grande Do Sul agriculture secretary has called on cattle breeders
to speed up the vaccination rate against FMD, because so far "only 20
percent of livestock has been immunized", although admitting that the
main problem is with small farmers who have rodeos [herds with] less
than 50 head. Agriculture secretary, Gelmar Tiebohl, according to
Porto Alegre's Zero Hora daily has recalled that the vaccination
period will be over by [31 May 2010] with no extension of the period planned.

Zero Hora reports there have been unexpected difficulties with the
distribution and the free vaccines are not arriving on time to the
small farmers. Apparently of the 4 million doses distributed free of
cost by the provincial government only 241 000 are recorded as having
effectively been used. The information covers 392 municipal areas
with information from another 104 still missing.

"The creation of 'immunity windows' is the main alarming consequence
of the delay in vaccinating cattle in a given period of time" pointed
out Rio Grande do Sul Agriculture Livestock health director Bernardo
Todeschini.

Meantime in Uruguay over 50 percent of the rodeo [national herd] to
be immunized has already been vaccinated according to local
authorities. The vaccination period ends [31 May 2010]. During this
period all cattle less than 2 years, estimated in 6 million head,
have to be inoculated for which 6.5 million FMD doses have been
distributed. Besides the May period, in February every year the whole
national rodeo (over 12 million head) is vaccinated and in the
November period all calves born in the previous 12 months.

Uruguay is particularly concerned because in 2002 it lost its
condition of FMD [freedom] without vaccination when a highly volatile
virus spread over from Argentina. Similarly in several states of
Brazil the disease is recurrently endemic and threatens the whole
Mercosur area because many small farmers do not bother to vaccinate
or don't have the means to do so.

[This would seem to be a disaster waiting to happen. Latterly I have
been hearing of chaotic situations in various states, specifically in
rural Sao Paulo and Santa Catarina. A few years ago Brazil was a
leading force in the effort to eradicate FMD from South America. - Mod.MHJ]
