Scarlet fever cases are on the rise again. While North East Lincolnshire has reported just 1 case this month, there has been a sharp rise across the country, prompting a warning to parents to be on the lookout for symptoms of the infection.

As reported earlier in 2015, figures show the Yorkshire and the Humber region, which includes the Grimsby area, had the highest number of cases of scarlet fever in England, with a 200 per cent rise in North East Lincolnshire.

Nationally, scarlet fever cases have risen sharply this year so far, up from 4138 for the same period in 2013, 14 583 last year to 16 170 so far this year. This is the only communicable disease that has shown a rise in the past 3 years.

[The scarlet fever outbreak that occurred throughout England in 2014 was worse than at any time in the past 50 years (http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/fastest-rise-in-scarlet-fever-cases-for-half-a-century-10045621.html) and now the number of scarlet fever cases in England in 2015 surpasses that in 2014.
