Referring to [the report from 27 Mar 2000 [cited above I would like to
[provide the data on the outbreak.
8 leptospirosis cases were notified from 7 until 23 Mar 2000 among
employees of a fish processing company. All patients had clinical signs
compatible with leptospirosis ([references to "an intestinal disease"
[were incorrect interpretations of the information from mass media). The
diagnosis was confirmed serologically by [a microscopic agglutination
test. Blood samples from all patients were tested for 15 serological groups
of _Leptospira_. 6 samples showed the evidence of _Leptospira_ serovars:
_icterohaemorrhagiae_, _sejroe_, _javanica_, _cynoptery_, and _ballum_. One
sample was negative. The diagnosis of [a lethal case was based on
clinical, epidemiological and pathomorphological evidence.
An epidemiological investigation was organized by [the epidemiologist of
[a local Environmental Health Centre and the National Environmental Health
Centre. During the epidemiological investigation of [the outbreak 57
employees were tested serologically. 9 samples (18%) were positive to
different _Leptospira_ serovars. Appropriate control measures were taken
including observation of contacts, disinfection, derating, education of
employees etc.

[We are grateful for this excellent information. I presume that the
epidemiological information is based on single sample titrations rather
than on a comparison of acute and convalescent sera. If so, some of the
positives could be reflections of prior exposures. - Mod.ES
