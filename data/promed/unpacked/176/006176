Rabies found in horse; public health threat considered serious
--------------------------------------------------------------
The death of a rabid horse in Black Forest provides new evidence that
a disease once considered a negligible threat in Colorado is now a
serious public health problem, health experts said Tuesday [15 Sep
2009].

The horse was euthanized Friday [11 Sep 2009] and later tested
positive for rabies, the 1st case of a rabid horse in Colorado in at
least 25 years, according to the El Paso County Department of Health
and Environment, which announced the case Tuesday [15 Sep 2009].
Health experts believe the horse contracted rabies from a skunk, the
first known "spillover" casualty of a strain of skunk rabies that's
shown up in Colorado for the 1st time in decades.

"I think it's a seminal event," said Dr Bernadette Albanese, medical
director at the El Paso County health department. The fact that a
horse contracted the virus means there are a number of infected skunks
out there, and they are moving around, she said.

Health officials are urging people to vaccinate pets and livestock for
the virus, which attacks the nervous system and is usually transmitted
by infected saliva.

In recent months 6 rabid skunks have been discovered in the county,
making this the 1st year that skunk rabies has been reported here
since 1970. Although the cases were in northern and eastern El Paso
County, Albanese said that doesn't mean rabies is limited to those
areas.

"At this point, with so much going on in a 2- to 3-month period, I
think anywhere in the county's a risk, no matter where you are,"
Albanese said.

If rabies becomes more prevalent in animals that have frequent contact
with people, it could raise the risk of someone being exposed to the
disease and having to undergo an expensive shot regimen [post exposure
prophylaxis (PEP) - Mod.TG] to stop it.

It could also change the way health officials handle animal-bite
cases. People are frequently bitten by dogs, for example, but seldom
treated for rabies. That could change if the disease begins to spread
among pets. Once symptoms show, the disease is fatal.

Rabies is so rare in horses that vaccines have only recently been
recommended for them, said Dr Jim Friedly, a large-animal veterinarian
in Falcon. Even so, many horse owners in Colorado have declined to
order it, because rabies in horses here was so unlikely.

Friedly said the risk of rabies means horse owners should be
especially aware of unusual signs and take extra caution. If a horse
is drooling or foaming at the mouth, for example, don't go fishing
around for stuck grass or inspect its mouth for problems. A foaming
mouth could mean rabies.

Rabies prevention
-----------------
a. Get pets, horses, and other high-value livestock vaccinated.
b. Don't feed wild animals or allow your pets around them. Make sure
children stay away from wild animals.
c. Contact the vet if a pet is bitten or scratched by a wild animal.
d. Call a doctor immediately if you suspect you've been exposed to rabies.
e. Stay away from an animal exhibiting bizarre behavior, such as a
nocturnal animal like a skunk wandering about during the day.
f. If you must remove a dead skunk on your property, wear rubber
gloves or lift the carcass with a shovel or other tool, and double-bag
it for the trash.

Texas horse dies of rabies, possible human exposure
---------------------------------------------------
Public health officials in Texas are alerting anyone who may have come
in contact with a certain horse at the Scurry County Rodeo, held in
mid-July [2009] in Snyder, that they might have been exposed to
rabies. More than 250 contestants from Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana,
New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas participated in the rodeo.

The horse was at the rodeo 16-18 Jul 2009. It became ill on 28 Jul,
died on 30 Jul, and tested positive for rabies on 5 Aug 2009. The
horse was not in any rodeo ceremonies or events and was in a stall the
entire time. Officials say it is highly unlikely, but possible, that
the horse was capable of transmitting the rabies virus while at the
rodeo arena.

The 6-year-old sorrel quarter horse mare was 14 hands high [a hand has
been measured as 4 inches (about 10 cm), so that a 14 hands horse
would be approximately, 56 inches [about 1.42 m] tall at the withers
or shoulders - Mod.TG] with white rear stockings and a white star on
her forehead. The horse was in the 4th stall from the south end of a
row of stalls on the west side of the arena grounds in a parking area
reserved for contestants. The adjoining stalls were empty. The arena
is on Gary Brewer Road in Snyder.

Health officials say transmission could have occurred if the horse bit
anyone or if saliva from the horse got in an open wound or cut or in
the eyes or nose of a person.

If you might have been in contact with this horse, contact a doctor or
call the Texas Department of State Health Services at 512/458-7255 to
determine if you need to receive treatment to prevent rabies.

[Vaccines for horses have been around for many years, however not all
horse owners believe the vaccine to be a cheap insurance policy for
themselves, their family, and their horses.

Horses may show a slight behavior change that may at first go
unnoticed. For example the horse may seem frisky, perhaps associated
with the cooler weather of autumn, or take a playful nip, and in a few
days the playfulness may be outward aggression, without necessarily
signs of drooling. There may be stumbling or ataxia, and may be
confused with diseases such as eastern equine encephalitis or West
Nile virus. Other animals may have little to no neurological signs,
but only appear to be choking.

All pet and livestock owners are encouraged to protect themselves, and
their families by vaccinating the companion animals (dogs, cats, and
horses) and livestock such as cattle, goats, and sheep, especially if
these are show animals around which there are people on a daily or
near daily basis. That small investment in a vaccine may be what saves
your life. - Mod.TG]
