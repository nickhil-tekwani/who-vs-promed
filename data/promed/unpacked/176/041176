Rhode Island health officials are reported to have initiated a program to
vaccinate up to 250,000 persons between the ages of 2 and 22 years against
meningococcal meningitis. Dr. Patricia Nolan, Director of Health for Rhode
Island issued the unusual vaccination recommendation in response to 11
cases of bacterial meningitis that have occurred this year, with 3
fatalities. The 3 fatalities were geographically dispersed and apparently
epidemiologically unrelated. Despite the unusual recommendation for
widespread vaccination, Dr. Nolan is quoted as saying "this is not an
outbreak."
Massachusetts health official, Dr. Bela Matyas, is quoted as disagreeing
with the Rhode Island response saying, "what they are doing is dangerous,
not only because there may not be enough vaccine available for intended
uses, but because it has created alarm that has crossed over to residents
of Connecticut and Massachusetts." Massachusetts has reported 12 cases of
bacterial meningitis this year with 2 fatalities. Last year, Massachusetts
had seen 26 cases with 6 fatalities by this time.
Nancy Rosenstein of the CDC's Meningitis Program is reported to have said
that the Rhode Island response is "reasonable" but that "there's no reason
to panic in Rhode Island or Massachusetts."
A spokesperson for Pasteur Merieux Connaught, the vaccine producer has
indicated that production has been increased in response to the demand, and
that it is probable that the demand can be met.

[Based upon the information reported by news media, the response of Rhode
Island health officials seems to me to be a bit extreme. ProMED-mail would
appreciate comments from CDC or other officials concerning the reports in
the media, and their views of the scientific/ medical basis for a response
of this magnitude to the meningococcal meningitis cases reported in Rhode
Island. Laboratory data indicating strain relatedness, or lack thereof,
for meningococcal isolates from the 11 Rhode Island cases would also be
useful in assessing the situation. - Mod.ES]
