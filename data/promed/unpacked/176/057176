Two international news services have reported the issuance of a warning of
hemorrhagic disease outbreak in China, now as the flood waters recede.
The health department of China's heavily flood-damaged northeastern
Heilongjiang province has issued an emergency circular putting affected
areas on guard for an epidemic.
The population of rodents, which carry the virus, has risen sharply in
flooded areas, it said, and many regions in the province face the danger of
an outbreak, a ministry of health official was quoted as saying. This
official added that men in their prime are most likely to contract
hemorrhagic fever, an often fatal condition for which there is no effective
treatment. A program to exterminate rodents is due to begin, according to
Xinhua.

[This report contained some inaccuracies with regard to transmission of the
etiologic agent of this disease, in China called epidemic hemorrhagic
fever, in Korea called Korean hemorrhagic fever, but just about everywhere
else called hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). I have deleted
the inaccurate statements.
The etiologic agent of HFRS is Hantaan virus (transmitted by certain
species of mice) but HFRS can also be caused by Seoul virus (transmitted by
certain species of rats). Both are related to Sin Nombre virus, the
etiologic agent of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in North America and
to other hantaviruses causing HPS in the Americas. Sharp increases in
rodent populations have been used in China to predict outbreaks of HFRS. It
remains to be seen whether the conditions caused by the extreme flooding in
China will be related to an increase in HFRS there.
One way or another, China will have to confront the disastrous results of
its flood control program. - Mod.CHC]
