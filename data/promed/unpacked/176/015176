Resurgence of Wild Poliovirus Type 1 Transmission and Consequences of
Importation -- 21 Countries, 2002--2005
-------------------------
After the 1988 World Health Assembly resolution to eradicate poliomyelitis
globally(A), the number of polio-endemic countries decreased from 125 in 1988
to 6 (B)(Afghanistan, Egypt, India, Niger, Nigeria, and Pakistan) in 2003 (1).
However, during 2002-2005, a total of 21 previously polio-free countries(C)
were affected by importations of wild poliovirus (WPV) type 1 from the 6
remaining countries (primarily Nigeria) where WPV was endemic; 4 countries
(Indonesia, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen) had outbreaks of greater than 100 polio
cases (1,2)(D). By the end of 2005, WPV transmission in all 21 countries
except Somalia had been interrupted or substantially curtailed. This report
summarizes WPV importations into polio-free countries during 2002-2005 and the
status of WPV transmission in these countries as of 24 Jan 2006, and describes
actions that polio-free countries can take to improve importation preparedness.
Origins and Timelines of Importations
-----------------
Comprehensive sequencing data enable tracing of the origins and routes of
virus importations(E). Of 21 previously polio-free countries with importations
since 2002, a total of 11 countries in Africa detected WPV type 1 during Sep
2002-Jun 2004; the virus was imported directly from Nigeria into Benin,
Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, and Chad and indirectly from Nigeria through
neighboring countries to Central African Republic, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana,
Guinea, Mali, and Togo [see Figure at above given URL - depicts a world map
showing the routes of spread of the WPV type 1 - Mod.MPP]. The number of
reported polio cases resulting from a single importation ranged from one in
multiple countries to 44 in Chad(F). [see Table at above given URL: genetic
profile of viruses, duration of circulation of WPV 1 following re-
introduction, number of cases, interval from onset date of 1st case to date of
confirmation, interval from confirmation to 1st large-scale vaccination
response, estimate!
d OPV coverage during 2004, and percent of districts with greater than or
equal to 80 percent coverage during 2003 - Mod.MPP]
In addition, WPV type 1 of Nigerian origin was transmitted into 7 other
countries after virus from the Chad outbreak spread to Sudan in mid-2004.
During November 2004--July 2005, WPV from Sudan spread to Eritrea, Ethiopia,
Saudi Arabia, and Yemen; subsequently, WPV was imported into Indonesia from
Saudi Arabia and into Somalia from Yemen. The number of polio cases ranged
from one in Eritrea to large outbreaks in Yemen (478 cases), Indonesia (299),
Somalia (154), and Sudan (146) (G)(4,5,6).
WPV type 1 originating from India has resulted in 15 polio cases in 3
countries since 2002. WPV type 1 was imported into Lebanon (one case in
January 2003), Angola (10 cases during Apr-Nov 2005) (7), and Nepal (4 cases
during Aug-Oct 2005 from multiple importations) [see above referenced Figure &
Table at URL link provided].
Consequences of WPV Importation
--------------------
Imported WPV did not result in sustained transmission in 8 of the 21
countries, including 4 countries (Botswana, Eritrea, Lebanon, and Togo) with
only one case and 4 countries (Benin, Cameroon, Nepal, and Saudi Arabia) with
either polio cases not directly linked genetically or epidemiologically or
with a duration of WPV transmission of less than 6 months. In the remaining 13
countries, imported WPV caused multiple-case outbreaks lasting greater than 6
months. In 8 (Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire,
Ghana, Guinea, Mali, and Sudan) of the 13 countries, transmission is
considered to have stopped(H), with a median interval between the 1st and the
last case of 315 days (range: 184-743 days).
The 8 countries without sustained WPV transmission differed in other ways from
the 13 countries with sustained transmission. According to World Health
Organization (WHO)/UNICEF estimates for 2003, the 8 countries had median
vaccination coverage (3 doses of live, attenuated oral polio vaccine [OPV3] by
age 12 months) of 83 percent compared with a median coverage of 52 percent in
the other 13 countries (p = 0.001, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). The median
proportion of districts with reported coverage of at least 80 percent also
differed: 63 percent for the 8 countries without sustained WPV transmission
and 20 percent for the 13 countries with sustained transmission (p = 0.009)
(8).
Timeliness of Detection and Response
------------------------
The median interval from onset of paralysis in the 1st case to laboratory
confirmation of WPV was 51 days (range: 24-123 days) in the 21 countries with
importations [see Table at above-referenced URL]. The median interval from
laboratory confirmation to supplementary immunization activity (SIA)(I) was 37
days (range: 7-102 days). All countries conducted multiple SIA rounds (mean: 4
rounds; range: 2 to 10 rounds) in response to WPV importations, some of which
had already been planned because of the known high risk for importations. SIAs
in west and central Africa and Sudan were synchronized among as many as 22
countries. The median interval from onset of the 1st case to the 1st large-
scale (i.e., greater than 25 percent of children) vaccination response was 92
days (range: 60-202 days).
Countries with Ongoing Transmission
-------------------
In 6 countries (i.e., 5 with sustained transmission [Angola, Ethiopia,
Indonesia, Somalia, and Yemen] plus Nepal with repeated importations),
transmission was detected during the most recent 6-month period. Nepal
reported a case with onset on [24 Oct 2005], and ongoing transmission,
although unlikely, cannot be excluded. The following are summaries of the
status in the 3 countries with recent WPV transmission and large outbreaks.
Yemen. 6 years after its last clinically confirmed polio case in 1999 and 4
years after conducting its last national immunization day (NID) in 2002, Yemen
confirmed its 1st case of imported WPV infection (onset February 2005) in late
April 2005. Even before the 1st case in the outbreak was identified, an NID
round was conducted in mid-April 2005 in response to the threat of importation
from Sudan. 6 additional NIDs were conducted during May-December 2005, with
type 1 monovalent OPV (mOPV1)(J) used for 3 of the 6 rounds. A total of 478
polio cases have been reported from 21 of 22 governorates, with only 5 cases
reported after the September [2005] NID; the most recent onset was [17 Nov
2005].
Indonesia. 10 years after its last clinically confirmed polio case and 2.5
years after its most recent SIA, Indonesia confirmed its 1st case of imported
WPV infection (onset in March 2005) in West Java Province in May 2005. By the
time the 1st response SIA was conducted, targeting 6.4 million children aged
less than 5 years in 3 provinces of the island of Java (25 percent of the
national target population), 99 additional cases had occurred; the outbreak
had grown to 252 cases in 7 provinces when the 1st of 3 full NIDs targeting 24
million children was conducted in August 2005. To date, 299 cases have been
reported from 10 provinces on Java and Sumatra; 11 cases have been reported
since the September [2005] NID campaign, with the most recent onset on [4 Dec
2005].
Somalia. The 1st case of polio in Somalia in 2005, which resulted from
importation of WPV from Yemen, had onset of paralysis in the capital city of
Mogadishu in July 2005 and was confirmed in September 2005. Before this case
occurred, the last confirmed polio case in Somalia (WPV type 3) occurred in
October 2002. Because of the difficulties of implementing polio eradication
strategies in Somalia, which has been affected by chronic conflict and
security problems, OPV SIA campaigns have been conducted in Somalia every
year. 4 NIDs (2 using mOPV1) were conducted during February-July 2005 in
response to the risk for WPV importation from nearby countries. After the
onset of polio cases in July, 3 additional NID rounds were conducted during
Aug-Nov 2005. To date, 154 cases have been confirmed, with the most recent
onset on [30 Nov 2005]; the cases have included 140 from Mogadishu, 11 from an
adjacent district, one from a district west of Mogadishu, and 2 from a
district in northwes!
t Somalia near the Ethiopian border.

MMWR Editorial Note:
Strategies for achieving polio eradication include high routine vaccination
coverage, high-quality SIAs, and acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance
that meets WHO performance indicators. Cessation of SIAs in portions of
northern Nigeria during 2003-2004 (2) and the ongoing deficiencies in
vaccinating children through routine services in many countries resulted in
regional spread of WPV type 1 from Nigeria into previously polio-free
countries, followed by intercontinental spread to the Middle East and Asia.
Continuing transmission in northern India similarly resulted in
intercontinental spread of WPV type 1 to Lebanon and Angola and contiguous
spread to Nepal.
During 2005, WPV type 3 polio cases were limited to 5 countries (Afghanistan,
India, Niger, Nigeria, and Pakistan). WPV type 3 typically is more
geographically localized than WPV type 1 and is less commonly associated with
importation events or subsequent outbreaks.
WPV type 1 importations and subsequent transmission has had a major impact
(e.g., on finances and human resources) on the Global Polio Eradication
Initiative. During 2005, a total of 1000 polio cases (54 percent of the global
total of 1856) were reported from countries with outbreaks caused by
importation, more than from the 6 remaining polio-endemic countries. Most
outbreaks required multiple rounds of large-scale SIAs to control and stop
transmission. Countries and international polio partners had to urgently
secure additional financing and vaccine. Because of these efforts,
transmission of WPV after importation has been halted or curtailed in all
countries experiencing importations since 2002, except Somalia.
The relative ease with which WPV type 1 originating from Nigeria spread
through west and central Africa to the Horn of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula,
and Indonesia, underscores the immunity gaps among children in the affected
countries. In the 13 countries experiencing outbreaks after importation,
routine immunization programs remained weak, and immunity gaps at the
subnational level enabled sustained transmission of WPV. The majority of
countries had discontinued large-scale SIAs soon after becoming polio-free
because of funding limitations. Inability to achieve or maintain high routine
vaccination coverage in the absence of periodic NIDs made some countries with
imported WPV vulnerable to reestablishment of WPV transmission within their
borders. When periodic SIAs are conducted, planning and supervised
implementation to ensure campaign quality and effectiveness are critical.
Delay in effective response vaccination contributes to extended duration of
WPV transmission, which facilitates further global spread. Although
surveillance systems detected and confirmed initial imported cases within the
recommended 60-day period in the majority of countries, response vaccination
often was not implemented within the recommended 28-day interval after WPV
confirmation. Only 6 (30 percent) of 20 countries met this target.
WPV importations from polio-endemic countries into polio-free areas will
continue to occur until endemic transmission is interrupted globally. The risk
for importation is greatest for countries adjacent to polio-endemic countries;
however, globalization and international migration pose a risk for
reintroduction of WPV to all countries. Maintaining polio eradication
strategies and preparedness can prevent WPV spread subsequent to importation.
All polio-free countries are advised to maintain sensitive, efficient AFP
surveillance systems in all areas to detect importations rapidly and to
maintain sufficient levels of immunity against polioviruses through routine
immunization programs or, where necessary, SIAs. Countries should prepare and
maintain plans for timely, large-scale, high-quality response SIAs in case
importation occurs.
WHO's Advisory Committee on Polio Eradication recommends that any polio-free
country that detects imported WPV take the following measures immediately: 1)
obtain a risk assessment from an international expert group and prepare a
large-scale vaccination response plan within 72 hours of case confirmation; 2)
conduct at least 3 large-scale, house-to-house immunization campaigns using
type-specific mOPV, initiating the 1st round within 28 days of case
confirmation(K); 3) target a large number (e.g., at least 2--5 million) of
children aged less than 5 years in the affected and adjacent geographic areas;
and 4) initiate independent SIA monitoring to ensure adequate coverage, with
rounds repeated in areas with less than 90 percent vaccination coverage (10).
Adherence to these recommendations and timelines, in combination with enhanced
surveillance and investigation, can minimize the impact of WPV importation and
facilitate global eradication of polio. Despite substantial progress tow!
ard polio eradication during 2002--2005, the potential for WPV importation and
transmission underscores the importance of sustained political and financial
support to avoid resurgence of polio worldwide.

[The above review is a nice summary of the status of wild poliovirus
circulation during the period 2002-2005. For the most up-to-date data on
poliomyelitis, check the polioeradication website, which includes cases as of
14 Feb 2006.�
<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp>
The data support the recommendations for the need to keep OPV coverage levels
of the population at or above 80 percent as a protective means against
reintroduction with continued circulation of the WPV.
A pity there wasn't inclusion of information on the vaccine-derived poliovirus
(VDPV) type 1 that has been circulating in Indonesia. According to the WHO
Regional Office for South-East Asia website, there have been 45 cases of VDPV
type 1 identified in Madura island in East Java Province.�
<http://w3.whosea.org/vaccine/linkfiles/polioupdate.pdf>
These cases have continued to mount -- see Poliomyelitis - Worldwide (Somalia,
Ethiopia, Indonesia) 20060111.0103 -- and are still "under investigation."
Information on the derivation of these VDPVs, especially if they are
genetically linked to the recent use of mOPV, is of interest. It is the
largest outbreak of poliomyelitis associated with VDPV identified to date. -
