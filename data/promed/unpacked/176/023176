According to the report of regional Rospotrebnadzor (Federal
Supervision Agency for Customer Protection and Human Welfare), 7
cases of tularemia were registered in the settlement of Berezovo from
16 to 23 Aug 2007. Four cases have been confirmed by laboratory tests.
A local authority has commissioned a plan for action to control the
spread of infection. The movement of non-immunized people to the
areas of risk is prohibited. Mass-information campaigns have been
launched to deliver health and prevention information. A
non-scheduled immunization for tularemia has been planned. House
visits are being performed to identify sick people, to control rodent
invasion, and to supply repellents.
Nakanune reports that 191 884 people have received vaccine against
tularemia during the last 6 years, 27 400 of them in 2006. During the
6 months of 2007, 51.3 percent of the eligible population have
received the vaccine.

[Sporadic cases of tularemia are common in different regions of
Russia, as the disease is endemic for all the country. Outbreaks,
however, are emergent events, even if of local scale. The suspected
route of infection and the clinical form or forms are not given in this report.
The Khanti-Mansiysky Autonomous Okrug (also called Yugra) is located
on the West Siberian Plain. It is a part of the Tyumen Region. - Mod.NP/LL]
