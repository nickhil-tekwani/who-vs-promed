Rare chiungunya disease strikes Malaysian village
-----------------------------------------------
A tiny coastal village in Malaysia's northern Perak state has been hit by a
sudden outbreak of a rare mosquito-borne disease, health officials and
local media said yesterday [4 Apr 2006].
More than 200 people have been diagnosed, and 7 people have been
hospitalized since the chikungunya disease, a form of viral fever spread by
mosquito bites, was 1st detected 2 weeks ago in the village, health
officials said.
Health Ministry Parliamentary Secretary Lee Kah Choon said the virus was
believed to have been carried by immigrant workers.
"We do not discount the fact that immigrants working in the village were
infected with the virus," Lee was quoted as saying by the Star daily.
Symptoms of chikungunya, which is not considered to be fatal, include high
fever, rashes on the limbs and trunk of the body, and arthritis affecting
multiple joints.
Lee said the government would continue to carry out chemical fogging in the
village to kill mosquitoes.

31 000 people affected by chikungunya in India
-----------------------------------------------
Around 31 000 people have been affected by chikungunya in 209 villages of
Maharashtra.
Maharashtra Health Minister Vimal Mundada today [4 Apr 2006] said cases of
malaria, dengue, [chikungunya] and typhoid were found in Nasik, Pune,
Aurangabad, Latur and Akola regions and that, so far, 13 921 patients
affected have been identified at 90 places, PTI report said here.
Dr. Mundada told media persons in Mumbai, the capital city of Maharashtra,
that the blood samples of nearly 5 percent of patients are being sent to
the National Institute of Virology, Pune to check on whether they are
suffering from dengue or [chikungunya]. Both the diseases spread through
mosquitoes that breed in stored water. [Chikungunya and dengue are 2 quite
distinct viral diseases and yet similar in most symptoms; the former is
caused by an alphavirus and the latter by flaviviruses. - Mod.RY]
As a precautionary measure, cleaning of water storage tanks and other
sources of stored water is advisable once a week, the Minister said.
She said the word [chikungunya] has been derived from the Swahili language
of African countries and clarified that it is "not connected with bird
flu." She said [chikungunya] was 1st detected in [1952] in Tanzania, and in
India it was detected in 1963 in Kolkata. In 1964, it was found in Chennai,
Pondicherry, Vellore, Vishakhapattam, and in 1965 in Rajahmundri, Kakinada
and Nagpur. In 1973, the same fever was found in Barshi and later in Yavat
village of Pune in 2000.
Dr. Mundada said the gestation period of [chikungunya] is around 3 to 12
days and added that the disease is not fatal.
She also said there is no vaccine for [chikungunya] or dengue, but both are
treated symptomatically.
