Paniai outbreak's cause still unclear
-----------------------------------
The government has not yet identified the cause of an outbreak that has
killed 97 babies in Papua's Paniai regency during the past 2 months, health
workers said. ["Papua" here refers to the Indonesian region Irian Jaya, as
opposed to the country Papua New Guinea (PNG), with which it shares an
island. - CopyEd.MSP]
"We have received a report that a team of private doctors are treating
patients in the area, but we haven't heard from them yet," Papua Health
Office deputy head Bagus Sukaswara said.
A team of doctors from the American-owned Freeport Mine in Tembagapura,
Timika, has gone to 6 districts in Paniai affected by the sickness, which
causes symptoms such as chronic diarrhea, vomiting and high fevers. They
had treated hundreds of patients during the past few days, and some doctors
had already returned to Tembagapura, Bagus said.
Bagus promised the government would soon follow suit and send 2 nurses from
Jayapura to join Dr. Aron, the director of Paniai Hospital in Enarotali,
the capital of Paniai. The 2 nurses would fly to Timika from Jayapura and
then travel on to Paniai.
"The 2 nurses and Dr. Aron will go to the 6 districts on Monday [20 Dec
2004], and they will begin to examine the causes behind the outbreak and
also to treat local residents," said Paminto Widodo, the coordinator of the
Papua Health Crisis Center.
Paminto speculated the illness had hit the area due to poor sanitation.
Inadequate and late treatment had probably led to the large number of
fatalities, Paminto said. "There is a report that there are only 2 nurses
in a community health center in the area. Besides a lack of manpower, the
health center also lacks medicines."
The sickness had struck hundreds of residents, mostly infants and toddlers.
"These diseases are common but become fatal in the absence of proper
medical treatment," said Lana Oyong, a doctor from Tembagapura, Timika, who
helped treat local residents for 3 days until 15 Dec 2004. He would not
specify what the diseases were. Death rates are often high in the province
from common bacterial infections in contaminated food or water.
Rev. John Cutts, from Kemah Injil Church in the area, said that companies,
hospitals and non-governmental organizations in Paniai had begun channeling
medical and food aid to residents. Cutts said no one was to blame for the
slow and late medical treatment that led to the high death rate, because
the districts were located in remote areas. They could only be reached by
plane, impeding rescue and treatment efforts, he said.

with a febrile gastrointestinal outbreak among 0-2 year olds. More
information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources would be
appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
