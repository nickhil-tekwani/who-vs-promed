The government is expected to take special powers to close public footpaths
near farms, to reduce risk of spreading FMD virus. Requests for voluntary
avoidance of livestock farms has apparently not been completely successful.

Agriculture Minister Nick Brown has announced the Government is applying
for 152M BPS "agrimoney" compensation for beef, sheep and dairy farmers,
arising from the drop in incomes for the year 2000. 16M would be taken
from future budgets of the pig industry restructuring scheme for those who
need help now.

Scotland was warned it was on the brink of a "Foot and Mouth Disaster" last
night as the crisis deepened with the confirmation of a 12th case of the
disease south of the border.
Government ministers and officials will today discuss the extension of the
current ban on UK livestock movements beyond Friday's original deadline,
although Agriculture Minister Nick Brown told the Commons there could be
some individual movements between farm and abattoir under licence.
The one farm under suspicion in Scotland was this morning awaiting results.
Grampian Country Food Group, which owns Banks Farm, near Fyvie,
Aberdeenshire, were cautiously optimistic the pig farm would be cleared today.
The Government's chief veterinary officer, Jim Scudamore, admitted
livestock farmers may have to suffer the ban on exports for up to 6 months
after the UK is declared free of FMD.
Almost 7000 animals have been or are about to be slaughtered in a bid to
stop the disease, including 1800 cattle, 1600 pigs and 3500 sheep. Mr Brown
said he will announce some form of controlled movement of animals direct
from farms to abattoirs.
If Scotland remain free of the disease, strictly controlled movements of
cattle, sheep and pigs direct from farms to abattoirs may be resumed.

The Department of Agriculture last night issued a raft of measures aimed
at keeping Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) out of Northern Ireland.
A number of checks were put in place at Northern Ireland ports and airports
to stop the spread of disease, and Minister for Agriculture Brid Rodgers
said she believes Northern Ireland was FMD-free.
Disinfection facilities have been provided for vehicles at Larne and
Belfast, and travelers have been advised to visit the Department of
Agriculture's veterinary staff if they have visited farms in Britain. All
livestock vehicles will be inspected and sprayed externally with
disinfectant. Any containing horses will be examined and the horses could
also be sprayed in special circumstances.
A complete ban has been placed on the trade of FMD-susceptible animals, and
all animal products will be checked to see if they meet the new stringent
regulations.

Suspected case on fourth Devon farm
-----------------------------------
A suspected case of Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) has been found on a fourth
farm in Devon, the Ministry of Agriculture said today. The case is not yet
thought to be linked to the existing outbreak at Burdon Farm in the county
and it is not clear which area the farm is in. A MAFF spokesman said test
results were awaited on a suspect animal.

Sale of sheep led to outbreak
-----------------------------
The spread of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) 400 miles from Northumberland to
Devon and on to the Continent started with the movement of 18 sheep worth
less than 900 BPS.
The sheep were taken from Prestwick Hall Farm, Ponteland, to Hexham market
on 13 Feb 2001 -- 6 days before the Government was aware that the disease
might be in the country. They were probably already infected or incubating
the disease, which had spread by wind from the pig unit in
Heddon-on-the-Wall 4 miles away, still believed to be the possible source
for the outbreak. Pigs from Heddon are sent regularly to Cheale Meats, of
Little Warley, Essex, where the disease was identified last Monday.
State vets took another 3 days to track down the Heddon plant from which
the virus infected several farms, including Prestwick Hall. Another
infection, at Westerhope, was confirmed yesterday.
Richard Whitelock, spokesman for Hexham and Northern Marts, said last night
on the day the 18 sheep had been sold there were 3800 sheep and 85 cattle
at the market. They belonged to about 120 farmers and a difficult tracing
exercise was taking place. The sheep were bought by an agent for William
Cleave, a dealer from Devon. They stayed in pens at the market until the
evening of 14 Feb 2001, when they were moved to Longtown market, near
Carlisle, where Mr. Cleave had bought other animals. The sheep are believed
to have travelled by lorry from Longtown on 15 Feb 2001 and were sent to
Mr. Cleave's various farms in Devon.
A number of animals were sold on, some to British farms and others destined
for elsewhere in Europe. The Government is verifying destinations. Some
were sent to the Bromham abattoir in Wiltshire on Wednesday, and on
Thursday the day before the ban on animal movement began a number of the
sheep were on sale at Northampton market.
As many as 25 000 cattle, sheep and pigs are thought to have passed through
the 3 markets, and all animal movements are now being urgently checked by
Ministry of Agriculture vets. The Government was alerted to a possible new
case in Devon on Saturday evening, and scientists worked through the night
to provide conclusive results on Sunday.
Mr. Cleave exported 349 sheep to Germany on 12 Feb 2001. The Government
immediately informed German authorities of this, and the sheep have been
slaughtered as a precaution though it is unlikely they were at risk of
infection or incubation. Other animals are likely to have been sold to
other dealers who collect batches for export to France, Belgium or The
Netherlands.
Last night cases linked to Mr. Cleave's business were confirmed in Hereford
and Okehampton, Devon. All animals on his farms are now to be slaughtered
as "dangerous contacts."
Vets and staff from abattoirs and the Meat and Livestock Commission have
been enlisted to identify farms which could be at risk. Jim Scudamore, the
Government's Chief Veterinary Officer, appealed to all farmers to report
anything suspicious to their vet.

Farmers bring Brussels to a standstill
--------------------------------
Irate farmers protested in Brussels yesterday as European Union (EU)
agriculture ministers met to discuss BSE and FMD.
There is also rising alarm at the possibility that FMD may have spread
across the Channel. Germany and Holland have begun slaughtering animals
recently imported from Britain as a precautionary measure. North
Rhine-Westphalia ordered the slaughter and burning of 350 sheep from 2
farms, one of which had bought sheep originating from an English farm
infected with foot-and-mouth disease.
Sandwich controls were imposed on all British travelers arriving in German
airports. "All uneaten on-board lunches found on aircraft from London are
being taken away and incinerated," German officials said.
Spain has slaughtered 540 British pigs. Belgium has banned animal markets
and is trying to trace 2000 sheep recently imported from Britain. France is
carefully monitoring 20 000 sheep imported from Britain this month.
Nick Brown, the Agriculture Minister, flew to Brussels last night to brief
his EU counterparts in Brussels on the situation in Britain.

French praise quick action by the British
------------------------------------
A French farmers' leader paid a rare tribute to Britain yesterday for the
measures taken to combat FMD. With the specter of an outbreak looming over
France, Guillaume Roue, vice-president of the French Pork Federation, said:
"We are extremely worried but we are satisfied with what is being done by
the British authorities and the British farmers. It is difficult to see
what more could be done, either by Britain or by the European Union at this
stage."
In the meantime a list of British animals imported into France over the
past month is being compiled by the French authorities. One option under
consideration in Paris is to slaughter all of them.
The debate was given added urgency yesterday by the news sheep from the
farm in Devon, the scene of the latest FMD cases could have been exported
to France. They are among a total of 47 000 sheep believed to have crossed
the Channel over the past 30 days. Many are destined for the Muslim Aid El
Kebir celebration. France also imports 5000 pigs from Britain a year.
All farms thought to have bought British animals over the past month have
been visited by vets, who are compiling the list that will be the key
French tool in the fight against FMD.

[The primary infection in the Heddon pigs has not been revealed, if it is
known. The virus didn't jump from Asia to the UK all by itself. Granted
these were swill-fed pigs, but that merely points the finger at one more
possible source in those kitchens producing swill as a side-product of
English meals. If they were using ham or sausages contaminated with
possible virus, those animals would have been infected, perhaps, within the
past 3 months in whatever region the ham or sausage meat came from. - Mod.TG
