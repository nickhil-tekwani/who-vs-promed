Tomato bacterial wilt strikes again
-----------------------------------
[In Mukono district], tomato plantations started to wither away.
Godfrey Sseruwu, Mukono Zonal Agricultural Research Institute
(Muzardi), identified the disease as tomato bacterial wilt. He said
the disease is caused by a soil-borne bacterium, _Ralstonia
solanacearum_, which cannot be controlled by spraying.

Mr Sseruwu said the disease is currently a great threat to tomatoes
mostly in the central and eastern regions of Uganda. "Once you know
that the soils were once affected, don't plant tomatoes there," he
advises. He adds, "Whenever you see an affected plant, remove it
immediately and burn it."

Sseruwu says farmers can also use tolerant varieties like Tangeru 97,
which is currently being evaluated by researchers at Muzardi.
According to him, the variety can be affected but not as much as
other common varieties.

Tomatoes are the most popular vegetable used by almost everybody
daily and dominate home gardens. Mr Sseruwu says farmers ought to
seek advice from extension services when they spot any type of
disease.

Nepali farm develops disease-resistant tomatoes
-----------------------------------------------
Gorkha Seed Company has developed 9 varieties of disease-resistant
and heat-tolerant tomatoes and is making final preparations to
introduce them into the market. "The varieties we have developed are
bacteria-resistant and withstand hot climate," senior scientist Dr
Kedar Budhathoki said.

The research is currently being undertaken in Lalitpur [district].
"Farmers can produce at least 10 kg [22 lb] per plant even under
worst conditions, with temperatures as high as 40 deg C [104 deg F],"
said Budhathoki.

"We are planning to export seeds of these varieties to India and
Bangladesh where the climate is hot and the possibility of bacteria
attack is high," the company said.

[Bacterial wilt (BW) caused by _Ralstonia solanacearum_ is one of the
major diseases of tomato and other solanaceous crops (including
potato and aubergine). It is most severe in tropical and subtropical
areas with high rainfall and warm temperatures. Symptoms on tomato
include wilting of the youngest leaves, which may recover temporarily
during cooler evenings; eventually the whole plant wilts permanently,
roots and lower portion of the stem develop browning of the vascular
system, invaded roots may rot, and plants may die.

The bacteria are spread by mechanical means (including insects),
contaminated equipment, infected plant material, soil, and water.
They can survive in soil on plant debris or roots of hosts. Some
weeds and volunteer crop plants may serve as pathogen reservoirs.

Disease management is difficult, relying mostly on exclusion from new
areas and use of certified clean tomato explants for planting. Some
cultural methods (such as crop rotation), control of pathogen
reservoirs, and phytosanitary measures may be used. Grafting
susceptible tomato varieties onto rootstocks of resistant aubergine
lines is widely practiced in some Asian countries. Tomato varieties
with some genetic resistance/tolerance exist, but due to the
different strains of the pathogen may not be suitable for all
regions. Therefore, breeding programmes to develop resistant tomato
varieties suitable for local conditions, like the one in Nepal, are
needed.

_R. solanacearum_ affects more than 200 plant species including
important crops such as banana, potato, peanut and a number of
vegetables. _R. s._ has been classified into various races and
biovars active under different climatic conditions and affecting
different hosts.
