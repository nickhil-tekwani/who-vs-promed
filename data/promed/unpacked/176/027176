Nebraska has never had a case of Lyme disease confirmed to be contracted within the state -- until now. Officials with Nebraska's Department of Health and Human Services say 2 cases of Lyme disease were recently confirmed in Thurston County.

Lyme disease is an infection caused by specific bacteria from the bite of an infected tick. Its symptoms are very mild at first but can get increasingly worse if the infection spreads to the heart, the nervous system, or the joints.

Both people contracted Lyme disease around the same time and near the same place. That sent researchers in multiple health departments to the area for a full environmental investigation. They collected blacklegged ticks from areas where they think the two people were exposed. Those ticks were sent off to labs at Creighton University and the CDC's Division of Vector-Borne Disease where they tested positive for _Borrelia burgdorferi_-- the bacteria that causes Lyme disease.

Officials say it's the 1st definitive evidence a case of Lyme disease was contracted within Nebraska. But they say it doesn't mean the bacterium isn't already spreading and established among Nebraska's tick population. With the colder weather setting in, most ticks aren't as large of a concern, but blacklegged ticks are still active even in the colder weather.

Your best bet to avoiding Lyme disease is avoiding ticks in the first place.

Tips from DHHS:
- use an EPA-approved insect repellent containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-menthane-diol, or 2-undecanone;
- treat clothing and gear such as boots, pants, socks, and tents with products containing 0.5% permethrin;
- dress in long-sleeved shirts, pants, and socks when outside;
- do frequent tick checks after being outdoors and remove attached ticks promptly with fine-tipped tweezers. Don't forget to check pets for ticks after being outdoors as well;
- shower as soon as possible after being outdoors.

Ticks are generally found near the ground, in brushy or wooded areas. They cannot jump or fly. Instead, they climb grasses or shrubs and wait for you to brush against them. This is called "questing". When this happens, they hang on to you with small claws and then find a spot to attach and take a blood meal.

What to do if you find a tick on you:
- remove the attached tick as soon as you notice it by grasping with fine-tipped tweezers, as close to the skin as possible, and pull it straight out. Early removal can minimize and often eliminate the chance of infection. After removing the tick, thoroughly clean the bite area and your hands with rubbing alcohol or soap and water;
- avoid using nail polish, petroleum jelly, or heat to make the tick detach from the skin. These methods are not effective and may increase the risk of disease transmission;
- watch for signs of illness such as rash or fever in the days and weeks following the bite, and see a healthcare provider if these develop. Be sure to let your healthcare provider know you were recently bitten by a tick.

[Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States and is caused in the US by the bacterium _Borrelia burgdorferi_ and rarely, _B. mayonii_.The white-footed mouse is the reservoir in nature and it is transmitted to humans by the bite of a hard-bodied tick, _Ixodes scapularis_, commonly known as the deer tick, in the northeastern US and upper midwestern US and _I. pacificus_ along the Pacific coast. About 30 000 cases of Lyme disease are reported to the CDC each year in the US. However, the CDC estimates that the actual number of cases is more than 10-fold higher (https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/datasurveillance/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Flyme%2Fstats%2Findex.html). Most cases are reported by week of disease onset in June-August, but cases are still reported in late November-December (https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/datasurveillance/charts-figures-recent.html).

The geographic distribution of areas with a high incidence of Lyme disease appears to be expanding, based on data from the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS); the number of counties with an incidence of â‰¥10 confirmed cases per 100 000 persons increased from 324 in 2008 to 432 in 2019 (https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/datasurveillance/recent-surveillance-data.html). Nebraska and all its surrounding states reported cases of Lyme disease in 2019, but that does not necessarily mean that Lyme disease was acquired in that state; people travel between states, and reporting is by state of residence, not the place where the disease was actually acquired (https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/datasurveillance/maps-recent.html).

Nebraska (pop., 1.9 million residents in 2020) is a state in the midwestern region of the United States, bordered by South Dakota to the north; Iowa to the east and Missouri to the southeast; Kansas to the south; Colorado to the southwest; and Wyoming to the west.

[The geographic range of the blacklegged tick (_Ixodes scapularis_) continues to expand in the midwestern USA, and with it the Lyme disease spirochete. The above report comes late in the season, but field investigators did find this tick in the areas where the patients resided. _Borrelia bergdorferi is now likely established in some foci in Nebraska and additional cases in coming years may be expected. - Mod.
