A case of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian flu strain has been detected in
a village in Sg Buloh, the 1st incident in Malaysia after the outbreak in
March last year [2006].
Agricultural and Agro-based Industries Ministry secretary-general Datuk Dr
Zulkifli Idris said 8 teams from the Veterinary Services Department had
been dispatched to cull all chickens and birds within a 1 km radius of the
village Kg Paya Jaras Hilir, beginning at 2 pm on Wednesday [6 Jun 2007].
Also affected were 3 other villages in the surrounding area: Kg Paya Jaras
Hulu, Kg Jaras Dalam, and Kg Kubu Gajah. Similarly at risk was the duck
breeding center run by the department, located less than 300 metres from
the site.
"On Saturday [2 Jun 2007], the Petaling veterinary office in Shah Alam
received a complaint from a resident in the village that 60 of his chickens
died suddenly in the past 3 days. Our officers visited the site the
following day and took samples from the sick animals for testing at the
Petaling Jaya veterinary laboratory. Initial testing showed that it was the
virulent bird flu strain H5N1. This was subsequently confirmed by another
round of testing at the Veterinary Research Institute in Ipoh. We have put
this case on red alert throughout the country, and all officers in the
other states have been directed to monitor birds in their areas," Dr
Zulkifli Idris said here on Wednesday [6 Jun 2007].
The areas within a 10 km radius of the affected villages would also be put
on a 3 month clinical surveillance for signs of any recurrence, added Dr
Zulkifli. "The Health Ministry has been informed, and they will take all
the necessary steps to monitor the health conditions and symptoms of the
residents living in the area," he pointed out.
Dr Zulkifli said an estimated 2000 birds and eggs, including chickens and
ducks, would be culled in the operation. "This is an isolated case, and
there is no worry at present. We will attempt to clear the affected areas
of any sick bird within 36 hours," he said, adding that Minister Tan Sri
Muhyiddin Yassin, who is currently overseas, had been informed on the
latest development.
Dr Zulkifli said although the affected area was not involved in any export
or import of chickens -- the nearest commercial farm was 12 km away -- both
the Federation of Livestock Farmers Association and Singapore's Agri-Food
and Veterinary Authority had been informed of the measures taken by the
government.
Dr Zulkifli said the department was still trying to trace the original
source of the virus.
