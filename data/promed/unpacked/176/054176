2004/052 new canker disease of pear in Italy: addition of _Valsa
ceratosperma_ to the EPPO Alert List
-----------------------------------------------
The NPPO of Italy informed the EPPO Secretariat of the presence of a
new canker disease of pear in Emilia-Romagna caused by _Valsa
ceratosperma_ [Vc] (Ascomycetes: _Diaporthales_). In 2001, this new
canker disease was observed, on a limited number of 30-40 year-old
pear trees, in 3 orchards in Emilia-Romagna (1 in the province of
Modena, 2 in Ferrara). Laboratory analysis revealed the presence of
Vc [anamorph _Cytospora vitis_ (=C. sacculus)].
In 2002 and 2003, the disease was observed on a larger number of
trees in the provinces of Modena, Ferrara and Bologna. Vc was not
only found on old trees, but also on young productive trees (from 8
years-old). In some orchards, cankers were observed on 70 percent of
the trees. In these orchards, as heavy pruning was needed to contain
the disease, crop losses were observed.
Surveys have been conducted in nurseries on certified and CAC
multiplication material, but, so far, Vc has not been found.
According to the literature, this is the 1st report of Vc causing
canker disease on pear in Italy and in Europe. Moreover, the EPPO
Panel on Phytosanitary Measures suggested Vc should be added to the
EPPO Alert List.
The situation of Vc in Italy, according to the EPPO Reporting
Service, can be described as follows:
Present, found in Emilia-Romagna (provinces of Bologna, Ferrara and
Modena) at low prevalence and subject to containment measures.
_Valsa ceratosperma_ (a new canker disease of pear)
Why: The presence of a new canker disease of pear caused by Vc was
reported by Italy, and the EPPO Panel on Phytosanitary Measures
concluded that this fungus should be added to the EPPO Alert List.
Where: EPPO region: Italy (Emilia-Romagna). In Italy, containment
measures have been taken to prevent any further spread. Asia: China,
Japan and Korea. Note: The IMI description of Vc (no. 1366, 1998),
gives a much broader distribution. However, the disease it causes on
pear, apple, and quince has only been observed in the Asian countries
mentioned above, and now in Italy.
On which plants: _Cydonia oblonga_, _Malus domestica_, _Pyrus
communis_. In Asia, Valsa canker is mainly reported on apple, and,
occasionally, on pear and quince. In Italy, it was only found on
pear. (cv. Abate Fetel was the most affected, but other cultivars --
William, Decana, Kaiser, Passecrassane, Morettini, General Leclerc --
were also found susceptible).
Damage: The fungus causes elongated cankers on twigs, branches and
trunks. Symptoms can easily be confused with other pathogens such as:
_Nectria galligena-, _Sphaeropsis malorum_, _Phomopsis mali_, and
_Erwinia amylovora_. When cankers develop, they can girdle twigs,
branches, and even trunks, which then lead to desiccation and death
of the distal part. Vc over-winters in infected wood and plant
debris, and most new lesions appear in spring. The affected bark is
swollen, water-soaked, and, in February, small dark pycnidia can be
observed. In spring, under humid conditions, pycnidia release spores,
which are responsible for new infection. The fungus penetrates
through natural bark crevices and wounds (due to adverse climatic
conditions or pruning). Ascospores are also formed in autumn/winter,
but it seems that they only play a secondary role in disease spread.
In the literature, it is mentioned that on apple, the disease may
remain latent for 1 to 3 years.
Dissemination: Within orchards, disease spread is ensured by the
production of pycnidiospores in spring, and, to a lesser extent, by
ascospores in autumn/winter. Over long distances, trade of plants,
and, eventually, of wood can ensure dispersal of Vc.
Pathway: Plants for planting, wood of _Cydonia_, _Malus_, and _Pyrus_
from countries where Vc occurs.
Possible risks: Fruit crops such as pear, apple and quince are
important for the EPPO region. Control of canker diseases is usually
difficult in practice. Mechanical removal of cankers is a
possibility, but data is currently lacking on chemical products which
may be effective against Vc. In Italy, high incidence in affected
orchards, and crop losses, have already been observed. Therefore, any
further spread of this disease should be avoided.

[Vc is the fungus that causes perennial canker in pear. Similar
diseases are caused by species of _Cytospora_ and _Leucostoma_. The
pathogens over-winter in active cankers, or, in dead wood, thus
perpetuating their life cycle. A controlled integrated pest
management program (IPM) is required to maintain fruit production.
Disease management includes control of other pathogens, such as the
brown rot pathogen (_Monilinia fructicola_), and other pests such as
insects, tree-borers, and rodents that cause injury to tree limbs.
Eradication of the pathogen is one strategy, but it is effective only
if affected limbs below the cankered area are removed and burned,
especially in younger orchards.
