[An] epidemic of brucellosis in Kyrgyzstan has affected 2000 humans.
The Red Cross and the World Health Organization (WHO) are at a loss
knowing what to do as the hospitals fill up and nothing is being done
to prevent the spread of the disease.

The small former Soviet nation of Kyrgyzstan that gained independence
in 1991 is showing in the Naryn region, a 10 percent incidence of
brucellosis in the human population according to the WHO. Brucellosis
in humans causes loss of weight, followed by a slow agonizing death
and abortion in women.

[The 10 percent incidence of brucellosis in Naryn reported in the
news release above has been denied by the Ministry of Health Care of
Kyrgyzstan. The director of the Republican Center of quarantine and
dangerous infections, J Gaibulin, told the correspondent from the
Kabar Agency that 404 cases [about 15 cases per 10 000 population] of
brucellosis were registered this year [2008] in Naryn oblast and 444
cases last year [2007] (see
<http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache:C1drXd-t5BgJ:www.timesca.com/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26task%3Dview%26id%3D193838%26Itemid%3D7+WHO+brucellosis+naryn&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us>).

Brucellosis in humans is a zoonotic infection caused mainly by one of
3 species of _Brucella_, namely B. melitensis_, _B. suis_, and _B.
abortus_. Brucellosis is transmitted to humans either by direct
contact with tissues of infected animals or their
post-partum/post-abortion secretions, or by the ingestion of
contaminated, unpasteurized food products, mainly dairy products.
Direct person-to-person transmission from an infected mother to infant
can occur by means of breast-feeding. Sexual transmission has also
been reported. _B. melitensis_, which causes the most severe
infections in humans, is maintained in small ruminants (sheep and
goats), though cases in cattle and buffalo may occur sporadically. _B.
abortus_ is maintained mainly in large bovines (cattle and buffalo).
The _Brucella_ species that are causing brucellosis in Kyrgyzstan are
not given in the news release.

Brucellosis in humans causes fever, sweating, weakness, headaches,
depression, and muscle and joint pains, the duration of the which can
vary from a few weeks to many months or even years. Mortality is low
(less than 2 percent), and is usually associated with endocarditis.
Focal complications include sacroiliitis, endocarditis,
epididymoorchitis, and meningitis. Diagnosis is based on isolation of
the organism and/or serology.

Brucellosis in humans can be prevented by eradication of brucellosis
in animals and by pasteurization of milk. Brucellosis control
programs in animals involve test-and-slaughter, and/or vaccination.

_Brucella_ can also be used as a bioweapon, in which the
microorganism is delivered as an aerosol. An outbreak following
aerosolization would be initially difficult to detect because the
earliest indications of infection are non-specific flu-like symptoms.

The current situation with brucellosis in Kyrgyzstan is likely a
continuation of a prior outbreak that was noted in ProMED-mail post
archive number 20060924.2725. In this post, Dr Steve Berger said
that: "[Kyrgyzstan] may have the highest rate of brucellosis in the
world. Annual rates exceed those of adjacent countries and even
traditional "hot-spots" in southern Europe. See:
<http://exhibit.gideononline.com/Brucellosis-Kyrg.jpg>."

The rates of brucellosis for Kyrgyzstan [extracted by Mod.LL] ranged
from 15 to 24 cases per 10 000 in the 1990's and rose to 50 in 2003
and 43 in 2004.

According to another prior ProMED-mail post, archive number
20060923.2715 that concerned brucellosis in Kyrgyzstan, Mod.NP noted,
"...hygienic standards are frequently not observed in the sale of meat
and dairy products. The population quite often does not hand over
sick animals to veterinarians for slaughter." Also see
<http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=20842>.

Kyrgyzstan is a mountainous, landlocked Central Asian country, west
of China, that is divided into 2 administratively independent cities
(Bishkek, the capital, and Osh) and 7 provinces (oblasts), one of
which is Naryn. The provincial capital of Naryn is about 350 km (218
mi) from Bishkek and 200 km (124 mi) from the Chinese border. The
town of Naryn has a population of about 50 000 (there are about 260
000 inhabitants in the whole of the Naryn oblast) and is separated
from the rest of Kyrgyzstan by mountain ranges
(see <http://www.advantour.com/kyrgyzstan/naryn.htm> and
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naryn>).
Sheep, raised on the extensive steppe and alpine pastures, are the
mainstay of the economy.
