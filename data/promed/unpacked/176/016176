Did I miss something? The problem here seems to be the feedlots. Regardless
of the weight of the cattle coming in, and regardless of the presence or
absence of high-energy barley, the toxigenic _E. coli_ is present in the
feedlot. It appears to be the nature of the feedlot that is causing the
problem. In the past 15 years it has become evident that major departures
from nature have resulted in emerging disease outbreaks. The feedlot may be
a significant enough departure that we are seeing a major microbial form
arise from that environment.

The following is in response to Hal Nash's suggestion that the _E. coli_
O157:H7 problem is due to feeding of cattle in a feedlot setting:
The hypothesis is likely based on the facts that the average size of
feedlots has sharply increased over the past 50 years and that cattle in a
feedlot are kept in a much higher density situation than, say, cattle on
range. Perhaps, too, the feeding of cattle an energy dense ration is being
invoked as something that is both unnatural and new. Barley, in particular,
is mentioned as a high energy feed. On these grounds, the hypothesis is as
reasonable as any of the other (of the dozens of) hypotheses offered to
explain the emergence and increase in E. coli O157:H7-associated human
disease. It is not, however, supported by certain other data.
First, the prevalence of detectable _E. coli_ O157:H7 among cattle in
feedlots (individual prevalence) is similar to that in growing cattle in
other settings, including those grazing on pastures.(1,2) Second, the
probability of finding E. coli O157 in a feedlot (herd prevalence) does not
seem to be substantially different from other types of cattle operations;
given sufficient sampling intensity and duration, the organism can be found
at least intermittently in most cattle operations.(1,2,3). Third, studies
which have looked for an association between increasing size of cattle
operations and increasing _E. coli_ O157:H7 prevalence have failed to find
such an association.(4,5,6) Fourth, the fattening of cattle on high energy
diets is not all that new. From the late 19th century it was relatively
common for midwestern grain farmers to purchase and fatten cattle in a
confinement setting. The mention of barley in Hal Nash's statement is
perhaps based on a recent exploratory analysis which found a tentative
statistical association between barley in feedlot diets and the prevalence
of _E. coli_ O157:H7.(6) It should be noted, however, that cattle in that
study which were not on barley-containing rations were being fed some other
high energy feed such as corn or grain sorghum.
It is surely reasonable to hypothesize that changes in cattle production
practices might have contributed to the emergence of _E. coli_ O157:H7, and
a large number of possible changes (including an increase in size of
feedlots) can be named. Some are being examined with ongoing studies. But
in pursuing our explanation of why this pathogen emerged, we must remember
the adage that hypotheses are like back yard chickens: we'd best not get
too attached because we might have to eat them.
