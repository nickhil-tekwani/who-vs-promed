DOH: foreigner tests positive for MERS
--------------------------------------
The Department of Health confirmed [Mon 6 Jul 2015] that a foreigner from the Middle East who recently arrived in the Philippines has tested positive for MERS-CoV.

Health secretary Janette Garin said the 36 year old foreigner was admitted to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine last [Sat 4 Jul 2015] after showing symptoms of MERS-CoV infection on [2 Jul 2015].

"He was tested on [4 Jul 2015]. At 5 pm, the test yielded a positive result," she said in a press briefing.

She said the patient's viral load is low, which meant that the patient could be recovering. She said the patient had no diabetes or high-blood pressure.

One person who came in contact with the patient is in isolation after manifesting symptoms of MERS infection.

A DOH task force is now doing contact tracing after the latest finding.

Garin noted that there is no documented community transmission of the MERS coronavirus, saying that most infections happen inside a hospital.

"Health workers are usually at risk. Transmission also occurs during repeated and close contact with a family member or a household companion," she said.

The health secretary said the World Health Organization has not recommended the imposition of a travel, trade or screening restrictions related to MERS.

Travelers are advised to maintain a high level of vigilance especially those coming from MERS-CoV infected countries.

[This is now the 2nd case of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infection in the Philippines. In both instances, there was a history of travel to the Philippines from the Middle East. The 1st case from January 2015 involved a Filipino nurse returning to the Philippines from Saudi Arabia (see MERS-CoV (19): Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, Philippines, WHO, RFI 20150212.3160052). Another media report mentioned the newly confirmed individual arrived in the Philippines on 19 Jun 2015 (http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/philippines-confirms-second-mers-case-in-foreigner-who-arrived-from-dubai) 13 days prior to the reported onset of symptoms in this individual. More information on the travel history of this individual including dates of travel to areas known to have had MERS-CoV transmission and dates of onset of actual illness would be greatly appreciated. In addition, more information on the above-mentioned contact with possible symptoms constant with MERS-CoV infection would also be greatly appreciated.

One hopes this importation will follow a relatively benign course, similar to the 1st imported case in January 2015 without continued transmission of the virus within the Philippines.

[No news is good news.... Clearly, transmission has slowed down in South Korea, but it is much too early to conclude it has stopped, especially if the information in the media report in item [3] below is correct.

S Korean woman has MERS -- a week after quarantine over
-------------------------------------------------------
The latest Middle East respiratory syndrome ([MERS-CoV]) infection in South Korea took place a week after a woman was released from precautionary quarantine and the health authorities are now trying to figure out how she contracted the virus.

The 50 year old cancer patient, who was diagnosed with the disease last [Sat 4 Jul 2015], is the 186th person confirmed to have been infected with [MERS-CoV] in the country. She is the wife of a 55 year old MERS patient who caught the disease on [12 Jun 2015], but was discharged after making a full recovery last [Thu 2 Jul 2015], reported The Korea Herald.

The woman was quarantined for 14 days after her husband was found to be infected.

But the woman began showing 1st symptoms, a fever, only on [Thu 2 Jun 2015], according to officials from the MERS special response team at the health ministry. That was 21 days after being isolated from her husband. The disease is thought to have a maximum dormancy period of 14 days.

"It is likely she acquired the virus from her husband, and the symptoms belatedly showed up after her cancer treatment compromised her immune system," said Dr Jeong Eun Gyeong of the MERS special response team.

There have been similar cases of belated symptoms before, but the authorities maintained that there was no evidence the incubation period estimate was wrong.

She may have instead been infected by MERS at Samsung Medical Centre in Gangnam district, southern Seoul, where she went last [Mon 29 Jun 2015] to receive cancer treatment, 3 days before the symptoms showed up.

"We believe there is no possibility that patient no. 186 was exposed to medical staff infected with MERS... We are conducting further investigation on (her being infected via) other medical staff or patients, but such a possibility is low, for now," Dr Jeong said.

If this turns out to be true, the woman would be the 91st person to have been infected at the Samsung hospital, which has been found responsible for nearly half of the 186 MERS cases in the country.

The death toll from the MERS outbreak in South Korea held at 33 for the 5th straight day yesterday [5 Jun 2015].

[If the information provided in the media report above is correct, one suspects that the transmission to this patient occurred when she was at the Samsung Hospital for chemotherapy 3 days prior to onset of her symptoms. The key question then becomes how and where within the hospital did the transmission occur.

More information from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP
