Animal welfare charity the Scottish SPCA [Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals] says it has received a number of reports of dead and dying rabbits at Silver Sands beach in Aberdour.

Several rabbit carcases were visible on playing fields just yards from one of Fife's most visited beauty spots on Friday [3 Sep 2021]. Dog owners have reported finding rabbits that have died or have been suffering from myxomatosis -- which does not affect other species.

A regular visitor to the area said: "I saw a couple on Thursday [2 Sep 2021] and more today while out walking my dog. "I spoke to another owner who also said they had seen some too. "Most have been got at by seagulls and other birds. It's quite concerning as my dog will tend to pick them up."

Another dog owner said: "I've seen 4 dead rabbits on the field just in the last few minutes. I also witnessed a couple of live rabbits stood motionless further up the field. Usually, they would be frightened off at the sight of my dog but they never moved. I thought it was very odd, then a fellow walker mentioned that there had been an outbreak, which explains the sightings and the behaviour."

Scottish SPCA chief inspector John Chisholm said: "We have attended a number of jobs regarding wild rabbits with myxomatosis in the Silver Sands area. Myxomatosis is highly contagious among rabbits and unfortunately, there is no cure. The symptoms include bulging eyes, which can sometimes be crusted shut, discharge from mouth and eyes, and laboured breathing. Sadly, the disease does cause the animal to suffer and will eventually end in death. Unfortunately, the only way to eradicate the disease is by removing those with myxomatosis from the population."

[Myxomatosis is a viral disease commonly observed in European wild rabbits (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) and hares (_Lepus europaeus_). In case of high prevalence among rabbits, hares can also become infected by myxoma virus. The virus is a natural pathogen of the South American rabbit (_Sylvilagus brasiliensis_), where it causes a relatively localized fibroma. The myxoma virus is an example of a virus that has jumped to other species to produce an exotic disease and then coevolved with its new host. The virus is transmitted via blood-feeding arthropods or by close contact between infected rabbits or their excretions. - Mod.PMB
