_E. coli_ cases in Wisconsin and Minnesota have been linked to alfalfa sprouts produced by Jack & The Green Sprouts of River Falls, Wisconsin. Health and agriculture officials are investigating the outbreak. Minnesota officials urge consumers not to eat alfalfa sprouts produced by Jack & The Green Sprouts and retailers and restaurants not to sell or serve them.

7 _E. coli_ cases were identified in January 2016 and early February 2016 in Minnesota, according to a release by the Minnesota Department of Health. Those taken ill range in age from 18 to 84, and 5 are female. 4 of the cases are residents of the Twin Cities metro area and 3 live in greater Minnesota. 2 were hospitalized, and all have recovered. 2 additional cases of _E. coli_ infection, considered part of this outbreak, were identified by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (WDHS) in Wisconsin residents. Neither case was hospitalized.

Jack & The Green Sprouts distributes alfalfa sprouts to states in the upper Midwest and possibly other states. The 7 Minnesota cases and at least 1 of the Wisconsin cases were exposed to implicated alfalfa sprouts from a variety of locations, including grocery/cooperative stores, restaurants, salad bars and commercial food service.

This is an ongoing investigation, and the extent of the product contamination is unknown. Based on the information collected to date, health officials recommend not eating any alfalfa sprouts produced by Jack & The Green Sprouts. Currently, there is no evidence that other products produced by Jack & The Green Sprouts are contaminated. The sprouts may be packaged in a plastic clamshell with a brightly colored round label on top that notes the sprout variety. The alfalfa sprouts may also be mixed in the same package with other sprout varieties.

Symptoms of illness caused by this strain of _E. coli_ can include stomach cramps and diarrhea, often with bloody stools, but only a low-grade or no fever. People typically become ill 2 to 5 days after exposure, but this period can range from 1 to 8 days. Most people recover in 5 to 10 days. However, _E. coli_ infections sometimes lead to a serious complication called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which can cause kidney failure and other severe problems, including death. Those most at risk of developing complications from _E. coli_ include children younger than 10, the elderly and those with weakened immune systems.

[Although not specifically stated, the _E. coli_ here based on the text is likely to be an enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC). Several very large outbreaks of EHEC have been linked to sprouts, one being related to fenugreek sprouts when in 2011, Germany experienced the largest outbreak of EHEC cases ever recorded: a total of 3842 cases were reported, including 2987 cases of laboratory-confirmed _E. coli_ gastroenteritis with 18 deaths and 855 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) that led to 35 fatal outcomes. The outbreak started on 8 May 2011, peaked on 22 May 2011, and was declared finished by 4 Jul 2012. The organism in that outbreak was a unique genetic chimera, an _E. coli_ O104:H4 enteroaggregative enteropath that also contained the gene for Shiga toxin. - Mod.LL
