Avian influenza has been detected in a 2nd Christian County poultry facility, the Kentucky Department for Public Health (DPH) is reporting today. Human transmission has not been detected, but all 2700 chickens at the facility have been depopulated as a standard public health safety measure.

Tests were conducted by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), which identified the presence of avian flu -- H7N9 low pathogenic avian influenza -- at the western Kentucky facility, according to DPH. There were no signs of disease in the birds at the time of testing. These findings mirror the positive test results announced at another Christian County facility earlier this month [March 2017], where H7N9 was also detected and the facility's birds were depopulated. Human transmission was not detected in either case nor has the virus been found to be spreading to the human population in Alabama and Tennessee, where the virus has been detected in poultry.

"The risk of avian influenza transmission from poultry to humans is very low, especially when poultry workers use proper precautions and personal protective equipment," said Dr Ardis Hoven, infectious disease specialist for DPH. "Person-to-person transmission of avian influenza viruses is even more unlikely. However, it is our duty as public health clinicians to monitor the presence and patterns of this virus to make sure, if there is a threat to the human population, we are aware and able to respond."

Avian influenza occurs naturally among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can affect domestic poultry more severely. Avian influenza viruses are spread through direct contact with affected birds or their waste, including contaminated bedding, feed, or water. Affected birds shed the virus in their saliva, mucous, and feces.

Only people who have direct contact with affected birds or their waste, or who live on farms where affected birds have been identified are potentially at risk. For individuals who might potentially be exposed to infected birds either as a farm worker or someone involved in the depopulation process, wearing personal protective equipment is advised, in addition to hand hygiene. The best way to prevent infection with avian influenza is to avoid sources of exposure whenever possible.

"A person having direct contact could become infected if an adequate amount of virus gets into the eyes, nose, or mouth, or is inhaled while disturbing contaminated bedding," said Dr Hoven. "Individuals experiencing symptoms of influenza, and who have had contact with affected poultry, should seek medical care for evaluation and testing."

Laboratory specimens are required to make an official diagnosis. Antiviral therapy, used in the treatment of seasonal influenza, is also the treatment for avian influenza. Specimens for influenza testing must be obtained before initiating antiviral treatment. The local health department and DPH will coordinate testing of those specimens at the state public health laboratory.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers the risk to the public's health from this North American HPAI H7N9 virus poultry outbreak in the US to be low. CDC has issued precautionary guidance for the public in the context of previous domestic HPAI outbreaks. This includes avoiding wild birds and observing them only from a distance; avoiding contact with domestic birds (poultry) that appear ill or have died; and avoiding contact with surfaces that appear to be contaminated with feces from wild or domestic birds.

[It is sad news to learn of another production facility being infected with this virus. Although it is the low pathogenicity strain, there is always the possibly of the virus mutating to the highly pathogenic strain.

Biosecurity is the watch word and should be the mantra for every facility. This includes people, as they may have backyard flocks; trucks as they may have come from a facility infected with a different strain; and of course prohibiting contact with wild birds. Close attention to the birds to notice the 1st slight sign of an animal not quite right is very important. - Mod.TG
