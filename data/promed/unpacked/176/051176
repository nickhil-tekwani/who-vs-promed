Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo - update
-------------------------------------------------------
As of Wed 24 Oct 2012, 52 cases (35 laboratory confirmed, 17 probable) with Ebola haemorrhagic fever [Ebola virus disease] have been reported in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Of these, 25 have been fatal (12 confirmed, 13 probable).

The cases are reported from Isiro and Viadana health zones in Haut-Uele district in Orientale Province.

The Ministry of Health (MoH) continues to work with local health authorities and international partners in active surveillance, tracing of contacts of probable and confirmed cases, infection prevention and control in health care settings, management of patients in health care facilities, logistics, social mobilization, provision of psychosocial support, and conducting anthropological analysis to support the control of the outbreak.

Surveillance activities are being strengthened in Isiro and neighbouring areas, including Bedhe and Nakwapongo. In Isiro, health care workers are being trained on basic infection prevention and control in health care settings. Through the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), a field laboratory has been set up by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC).

Social mobilization activities are being carried out in schools and churches in Isiro, Rungu, and Ngosaku to provide information on protection against the Ebola virus disease and to discuss concerns of the local population.

[These figures differ slightly from those attributed to the WHO by Agence France-Presse in the previous ProMED-mail posting in this thread (Ebola virus disease - Congo DR (21): (OR) 20121024.1361956). The case number has been reduced from 75 to 52, the number of laboratory-confirmed cases from 36 to 35, and the number of fatalities from 36 to 25. Nonetheless the figures are consistent, or more so, with the conclusion that the outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Orientale province of the Democratic Republic of Congo has been stabilised.
