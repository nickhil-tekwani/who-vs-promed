Since August, Costa Rica has been combating a resurgence of dengue in the
central Pacific region. To September 6, 5 cases of hemorrhagic fever and
the death of a 78 year-old woman due to the disease have been confirmed; 12
other patients are suspected of having hemorrhagic dengue based on similar
symptoms.
Costa Rica declared a red alert concerning the outbreak, the worst since
the disease reappeared in 1993 after it was thought to have been
eradicated. During 1997 the number of cases [of dengue fever approached
4,000, mostly in the central Pacific regions, bastions of tourism in the
country. The most affected province, Punta Arenas, 106 Km south of San
Jose, is a rural agricultural zone well suited to the vector, _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquitoes. The principal fear is the occurrence of an epidemic of
hemorrhagic dengue, not only in this province but also in Guanacaste in the
north Pacific and in Limon in the Atlantic. According to health estimates,
30,000 Costa Ricans are at risk of contracting [hemorrhagic dengue, as a
results of having had classic dengue in the past.
