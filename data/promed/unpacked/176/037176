Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever In Johor, Malaysia
-------------------------------------------
On 27 Oct 2000 The Sun newspaper reported that Johor has been placed on a
dengue alert following a 60.86% increase in cases and a higher mortality
rate this year. The Health Department has recorded 14 deaths among 1 155
dengue cases detected throughout the State from 1 Jan 2000 until 21 Oct
2000, of which 135 were [diagnosed as dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF). A
total of 11 deaths were recorded in Johor Baru district and another 3 in
Batu Pahat district. The Department's survey also showed that 79% of the
deaths from dengue were in the age range of 5 to 39 years. In 1999, 10
deaths were reported from a total of 718 dengue cases, of which 100 were
DHF. Health officers have conducted inspections of 372 525 premises up to
14 Oct 2000 and found a total of 2 326 premises [with breeding dengue
mosquitoes. Fogging exercises have been conducted on 175 369 premises
throughout the state and 248 warning notices have been issued.
The WHO Collaborating Centre for Dengue/DHF in the University Hospital
Kuala Lumpur received 47 samples from DHF cases in Johor between Sep 2000
and Oct 2000. Of these, 33 were found to be positive serologically by
dengue virus IgM capture ELISA and/or HI, and 20 of the 33 samples showed a
secondary dengue virus response by HI. A total of 6 strains of Dengue virus
type 3 was isolated from specimens which had low HI antibody levels.
From the virological surveillance conducted by the WHO Collaborating
Centre, Dengue virus type 3 was the predominant strain circulating in the
country between 1992 to 1995. Between 1996 and 1997, Dengue virus type 1
predominated and from 1998 to 1999, the predominant strain was Dengue virus
type 2. During the years when Dengue virus type 3 was the predominant
strain, it was noted that the clinical disease was more severe and the
mortality rate higher than that attributed to Dengue viruses types 1 and 2.
The re-introduction of Dengue virus type 3 as the predominant strain after
4 years is indeed worrying. From past experience, when a new predominant
strain is detected in the country, it is the second year in which the
disease increases to a peak. This should serve as an early warning that the
year 2001 may be a severe Dengue virus type 3 season in Malaysia and
greater efforts at vector control should be initiated immediately before
the dengue season starts in April/May.

Mosquito-Borne Dengue Kills at Least Six People in Honduras
-----------------------------------------------------------
TEGUCIGALPA: A fatal form of mosquito-borne dengue fever [dengue
hemorrhagic fever? has killed at least 6 people in the past month and
filled the Honduran Government's 18 hospitals to capacity, officials said.
Another 130 people were being treated for dengue fever on Tue 31 Oct 2000
and 381 others were under observation. [An additional? 2 children died
over the weekend, and the majority of the victims have been under the age
of 12.
Dengue is a painful disease characterized by headaches, rashes, cramps and
severe back and muscle pains. The variety that is striking Honduras causes
internal bleeding [dengue hemorrhagic fever and can be fatal. So far this
year, Honduras has counted 6 478 cases [of dengue fever compared to 11 000
last year.

Current Status of Dengue Fever in Bangladesh and Borneo
-------------------------------------------------------
BANGLADESH (Update - 23 Oct 2000): Dengue fever is rapidly spreading in the
cities of Dhaka, Feni, Khulana and Chittangong as a result of the heavy
rains. 4 223 cases have been reported throughout the country since 1 Jul
2000. Dengue fever is transmitted by day-time biting mosquitoes. As there
is no vaccine, travellers should take mosquito bite avoidance measures,
particularly during the rainy season.
BORNEO (Update 2 Oct 2000): The risk of dengue fever has been decreasing
since 1998 following the implementation of statewide eradication measures.
During the first 6 months of the year 2000, only 185 cases were reported.
The highest risk period of transmission is during, and just after the rainy
season. This unpleasant viral disease is transmitted by mosquitoes that
bite mainly in the day. Reduce bites by covering up and applying insect
repellent to exposed areas of skin.
