[Necrotising hepatopancreatitis (NHP) disease is caused by infection with Gram-negative, pleomorphic intracellular alpha-proteobacterium. The principal host species in which necrotising hepatobacterium (NHPB) can cause significant disease outbreaks and mortalities are _Penaeus vannamei_ and _P. stylirostris_.

NHP has 4 distinct phases: initial, acute, transition, and chronic. In acute- and transition-phase disease pathognomonic lesions are typically present in histological sections of the hepatopancreas, while in the initial and chronic phases of the disease, there are no pathognomonic lesions, and molecular and antibody-based methods for NHPB detection are necessary for diagnosis.

NHPB appears to have a Western hemisphere distribution in both wild and cultured penaeid shrimp. In the Western Hemisphere, NHPB is commonly found in cultured penaeid shrimp in Belize, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, United States of America, and Venezuela.

Clinical signs, a wide range of gross signs can be used to indicate the possible presence of NHP. These include: lethargy; reduced food intake; atrophied hepatopancreas; anorexia and empty guts; noticeable reduced growth and poor length weight ratios ('thin tails'); soft shells and flaccid bodies; black or darkened gills; heavy surface fouling by epicommensal organisms; bacterial shell disease, including ulcerative cuticle lesions or melanised appendage erosion; and expanded chromatophores resulting in the appearance of darkened edges in uropods and pleopods.

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, please refer to OIE Aquatic Manual 2014, Chapter 2.2.4 "Necrotising hepatopancreatitis", available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/current/2.2.04_NHP.pdf.
