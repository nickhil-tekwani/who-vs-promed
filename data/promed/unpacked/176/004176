Texas Prepares for Emergency Animal Disaster
--------------------------------------------
With 254 counties and more than 36 million head of livestock and wildlife
at risk, Texas animal health officials cannot afford to wait until a
foreign animal disease strikes to plan for disaster. For nearly 4 years,
the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC), the state's livestock regulatory
agency, and the Texas staff of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
Veterinary Services (USDA-APHIS-VS) have prepared to respond to an animal
disease or pest emergency, address bioterrorist events involving livestock,
or respond during a natural or man-made calamity, including a flood or
hurricane.
Each member of the joint state and federal first-strike force, called the
Texas Emergency Response Team (TERT), has advance duty assignments, to
lessen confusion when disaster strikes, says Dr. Linda Logan, Texas' state
veterinarian and head of the TAHC. Furthermore, nearly all of the state's
21 regulatory veterinarians are foreign animal disease diagnosticians,
trained to recognize dangerous animal diseases, and properly collect and
ship samples for laboratory diagnosis, she said.
In years past, said Dr. Logan, the USDA had sufficient funding to develop
and maintain first-response teams, which were called READEOs, or Regional
Emergency Animal Disease Eradication Organizations. Because of funding and
staffing cuts, the USDA today operates only 2 READEOs, and states have to
be able to respond immediately, Dr. Logan pointed out.
"The 216 TAHC staff and the Texas USDA alone could not sustain eradication
efforts for a long-term or widespread animal disease outbreak, so we also
joined forces with Texas' Department of Emergency Management, where we can
draw on services, technical expertise, equipment and manpower statewide,"
said Dr. Logan. "On 29 Mar 2001, Governor Rick Perry, recognizing the
importance of the Texas livestock industry to the state's economy,
appointed the TAHC as a full-fledged member of the 32-seat State Emergency
Management Council."
Governor Perry then established, by a letter dated 5 Apr 2001, the Foreign
Animal Disease Working Group, chaired by Dr. Logan. The objective is to
manage an animal disease emergency in the most efficient manner possible.
More than 30 state agencies are members of this group, which is working
closely with the Division of Emergency Management, Texas Department of
Public Safety. Among the members are: the Texas Veterinary Medical
Diagnostic Laboratory (TVMDL), the Texas Department of Highways, Texas A&M
University, and the Texas Department of Agriculture.
Dr. Logan said the TAHC also has organized a Stakeholder Advisory Group
that includes all the major livestock industry organizations in Texas.
This group will provide input and to be a part of the planning process
needed to manage an animal health emergency. The Foreign Animal Disease
Working Group and Stakeholder Advisory Group are working to complete the
Texas plan to manage animal health emergencies. The infrastructure
developed as part of this state plan will be tested in late June, 2001 in a
simulated animal health emergency.
"With the industry's support, we can succeed. Without it, all our best
efforts could fail," commented Dr. Logan. She said the 12
governor-appointed members on the TAHC commission also represent facets of
the livestock industry, including cattle feeding, exotic livestock and
fowl, equine, veterinarians and public members.
For several years, TAHC field staff across the state also have developed
valuable contacts with local leaders, including county judges, local
disaster agencies, agriculture teachers, county agents and private
veterinary practitioners through the TRACE--or Texas Rural Awareness,
Compliance and Education effort. With increased threat of foot-and-mouth
disease (FMD), field staff revisited community bellwethers to provide
disease information and instructions on how to report suspect cases.
Dr. Logan pointed out that livestock producers may avoid reporting cases,
for fear of crying "wolf." Diagnosis can also be confused with vesicular
stomatitis, VS, a viral disease that, during the past 10 years, has
resulted in sporadic outbreaks in New Mexico, Colorado and Texas.
Unlike FMD, however, VS can affect horses. In sheep, blisters and erosions
also can be caused by bluetongue, or contagious ecthyma, better known as
"sore mouth."
"If a producer sees an animal with erosions or blisters around the mouth,
in the mouth, excessive slobbering, lameness or foot erosions, we want them
to immediately contact their local veterinarian, the Texas USDA-APHIS-VS,
or the TAHC," said Dr. Logan. "We have a 24-hour hotline, and one of our
foreign animal disease diagnosticians is always available to take calls.
We'll dispatch a diagnostician to the premise to collect samples and assess
the situation."
To promote livestock health awareness, TAHC staff are encouraged to
actively seek speaking engagements for youth associations, producer groups,
and Kiwanis, Rotary and Lions' Clubs. The TAHC also distributes numerous
news releases, information kits and brochures to keep producers and the
public informed not only about regulations, but also disaster preparedness,
said Dr. Logan.
Because it's not enough to just plan for disaster, Dr. Logan said 5 TAHC
veterinarians have had month-long stints in Great Britain, as part of the
USDA's international assistance to the FMD disease outbreak. "Seeing field
cases of FMD and working on-site in an eradication effort is the most
valuable training for our foreign animal disease diagnosticians," she said.
This spring, Dr. Logan also attended a reunion of people who battled FMD in
Mexico in the late l940s and early l950s. "These folks have a wealth of
practical experience they can share," said Dr. Logan. "These men and women
are heroes, having spent several years eradicating the outbreak so near to
us."
With a common border stretching 1237 miles, Texas continues to maintain
communication and share livestock health information with Mexico's
livestock producers and veterinarians. Dr. Alejandro Perera, formerly a
USDA veterinarian in Mexico, is the TAHC bi-national liaison, and works
closely with the other border states: New Mexico, California and Arizona.
In November 2000, Texas participated in the Tripartite Exercise, involving
Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. The exercise was designed to test plans,
policies and procedures that would guide emergency response efforts to a
multi-site outbreak of FMD in North America. Hidalgo County, in South
Texas, was the site of a simulated foot-and-mouth disease outbreak.
This was the first time in the world that field staff were deployed in a
"real-time" exercise of 8 days' duration. Although the scenario began in
mid-October, for purposes of the exercise, it was not reported to livestock
health officials until early November. In the simulated storyline, a South
Texas swine producer on October 15 retrieved food scraps for his animals
from a foreign ship docked in Brownsville. Unwittingly, the producer had
collected scraps from food that originated in an FMD-affected country.
According to the scenario, after cooking the waste food, the swine owner
poured it back into the unwashed transport barrels to carry it to the
animals' troughs. Within a few days, the producer's swine exhibited signs
of illness and several litters of piglets had died. The owner finally
contacted the TAHC on November 1, but by then, he had sold several pigs
from the premise, and more than 1200 susceptible animals had moved through
a nearby livestock market. These animals were exposed to the disease when
the virus became airborne.
"What began as a one-site foreign animal disease investigation in the South
Texas county of Hidalgo literally 'blew up,' within 2 days, as we received
reports of sick animals next door in Cameron County and as far away as
Dallas County in North Texas," said Dr. Logan. "Furthermore, the storyline
included our need to 'catch' a truck that had been contaminated with the
virus. The driver had criss-crossed the country from Harlingen to Canada
and back, and from Missouri to the Rocky Mountains, potentially spreading
disease far and wide."
"This exercise gave us a 'homegrown' demonstration about how fast FMD can
get out of hand. Within 24 hours after the disease was passed through the
market, exposed animals were sent to more than 30 ranches and feedlots in 4
states," she said.
In just Hidalgo County, the estimated cost to stamp out the disease would
be more than $50 million, she pointed out. "We're using this knowledge to
reinforce the need for producers to report animal illnesses or death losses
to private practitioners or regulatory agencies," she said.
"Furthermore, after seeing that this exercise mirrored several of the
actual outbreaks worldwide in the past 18 months, the Texas legislature has
worked with us to ban the waste-food feeding of meat or meat products to
swine," said Dr. Logan.
The law is effective 1 Sep 2001, but penalties will not be exacted until 1
Dec 2001. The law will affect 610 TAHC-permitted waste food feeders in
Texas. Currently, Texas USDA animal health technicians make herd health
checks on the waste food feeders at monthly intervals and make temperature
checks of the devices used to cook the waste food to kill parasites,
bacteria and viruses.
As of 1 Sep 2000, the permitted waste food feeders will be allowed to feed
only "unrestricted garbage," which includes vegetables and fruit, dairy or
baked goods. Additionally, it will be against state law for restaurants,
schools or other establishments to provide wastefood meat or meat products
for swine feeding. The TAHC still will permit wastefood feeders, and
inspections by USDA and TAHC field staff will continue for disease
surveillance, noted Dr. Logan.
In late June, Texas will step up its preparedness with an FMD exercise in
College Station that will involve the state's emergency management system.
Staffing up is one thing; maintaining a major eradication effort for 190
days or longer will tax all entities, reports Dr. Logan.
"The exercise will give us an opportunity to review the organizational
structure and develop greater cooperation between agencies. We'll also have
an opportunity to discuss issues like biosecurity, decontaminating, humane
depopulation issues and other animal-related topics that may be foreign to
other members of the state emergency structure. We also want to address the
issues that will be associated with how to pay indemnity to producers."
"We'll be tapping the expertise of agencies, such as law enforcement,
including county sheriff's departments and the Department of Public Safety
troopers, on how to enforce quarantines and movement restriction. We'll
also be learning from community services agencies that aid with stress and
mental anguish, and other agencies that provide radio and phone
communications and ground support--like construction equipment for moving
dead animals and digging trenches for burning carcasses."
"Will we be ready if, or when a disaster occurs? That's a questions that
keeps me awake nights," lamented Dr. Logan. "No one is ever fully ready, as
there will always be surprises. But, with the state emergency management
system, we've got a lot of experienced folks who have weathered tornadoes,
fires, hurricanes and other catastrophes. The livestock industry wants to
be involved and has demonstrated their concern and willingness to be a part
of the planning process. Our staff is intent on preparedness. I only hope
this preparation won't be needed."
