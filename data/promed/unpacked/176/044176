In order to save the herd, federal wildlife managers say they may begin fencing in healthy Key deer battling a grisly outbreak of New World screwworm.

Crews have begun building a 6-foot high enclosure covering several acres of pine rockland in the National Key Deer Refuge at the north end of Big Pine Key, U.S. Fish and Wildlife officials said. If the population of the herd -- the planet's last -- drops below what it needs to survive, vets will corral healthy deer inside the pen erected with black plastic deer fencing.

FWS officials are now working with Texas A & M University, where much of the Key deer research is based, to determine what that number should be. "We are focusing on Big Pine Key and No Name Key due to primary herds being located on these 2 Keys as well as it being in the impact area," spokesman Kevin Lowry said in a text Monday [31 Oct 2016].

When the diminutive deer -- a cousin of the mainland white tail deer that migrated across a land bridge about 13 000 years ago -- were added to the endangered species list in the mid 1950s, the number had dwindled to about 2 dozen. The herd now stands at about 1000, wildlife officials say. Since August 2016, screwworm infestations have killed 121 [as of Sun 30 Oct 2016].

Officials took the unprecedented step as they ramp up efforts to save the deer after mostly males, in the midst of the mating season, started turning up in carports and under porches with festering wounds on their heads and shoulders. In the last 2 weeks, volunteers and refuge biologists have doled out 787 doses of doramectin -- a powerful anti-parasitic commonly used to treat screwworm outbreaks in domestic livestock -- to tamer deer in neighborhoods. It's not clear how many individual deer were treated.

But wild deer that wander more remote areas of the 8500-acre refuge are proving harder to treat. Vets treated 6 deer over the last week, using darts to sedate them then manually removing screwworm larva and applying a 30-day dose of a topical parasitic. A 7th severely infected deer was euthanzied.

Federal entomologists are also releasing millions [more] of sterile male flies in the coming weeks to mate with wild females and stop reproduction of wild screwworms.

For the time being, 4 large gates on the new pen will remain open, allowing deer to wander in and out, FWS officials said. But if the number of dead deer climbs too high, vets plan on luring a group of deer into the pen and closing the gates. A smaller enclosure will be built on Cudjoe Key to save a separate population if necessary.

[From what I have seen of white tail deer ranching in West Texas, they thrive on attention, but they will do better when they can do their thing un-afflicted with screwworms. With relations between the US & Cuba becoming more amicable, I can foresee the day coming when the US government will persuade the Cuban government to initiate a NWS eradication program on the island with US support in order to prevent another outbreak in southeast USA. - Mod.MHJ
