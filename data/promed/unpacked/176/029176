Health officials investigate an outbreak of legionnaires' disease which has
killed 2 people.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Health officials have confirmed 2 more cases of legionnaires' disease in an
outbreak in Hereford which has killed 2 people and left 2 more in a
critical condition in the hospital.
A man and woman in their 70s have died and 4 middle aged people are being
treated in Hereford County Hospital for the disease. 2 of the hospital
patients are in a critical condition in the intensive care unit, the Health
Promotion Agency said on Sat, 8 Nov 2003. All victims have links to
Hereford city center, where investigations are focused.
Public health officials are investigating the cause of the outbreak.
Environmental health officers visited shops and businesses to take water
samples from air conditioning systems to check for the bacteria which
causes the disease.
Professor Rod Griffiths, director of public health for the West Midlands
region, said anyone who was exhibiting symptoms of the disease should
contact their general practitioner (GP). He said doctors across the region
had been alerted to the outbreak and were on the lookout for further cases.
Prof Griffiths said: "If there are people who have had a strange kind of
chest infection, with more of a temperature and less of a cough than usual,
they should tell their GP."
Griffiths said microbiologists were conducting detailed tests on samples of
bacteria taken from the 4 confirmed cases to determine whether the patients
had contracted the disease from the same source. He explained: "These
specialist tests look at the genetics of the bug and the results are
expected early next week. "Then we will know whether they have all caught
the same species of the bug."
Dr Mike Deakin, Herefordshire's director of public health, added that
further cases of the disease linked to the outbreak could not be ruled out.
The incubation period is normally between 2 and 10 days but can be up to 3
weeks. Dr Deakin said that on average the county would expect to see an
average of 1 case every 2 years. "That is why we are particularly concerned
by this," he said.

Sixth suspected legionnaires' case
----------------------------------
A suspected case of legionnaires' disease connected to the outbreak in
Hereford has emerged in Wales. Health officials believe a 72 year old man
may have contracted the disease during 2 visits to Hereford -- where 2
people have already died from the illness. He is being treated in a Welsh
hospital but the location has not been identified.
A further 3 victims are also being treated in Hereford County Hospital for
the disease -- 2 in intensive care. Professor Rod Griffiths, director of
public health for the West Midlands, said, "A male pensioner is being
treated as a suspected case of legionnaires' disease in Wales. We have
spoken to the man's wife and ascertained that he had visited Hereford twice
within the relevant time window."
Dr Mike Deakin, Hereford's director of public health, said health officials
were trying to trace the man's movements and hoping that because he was
only briefly in the city it might help to pinpoint the search for the
outbreak's source. He said: "This could prove a very useful lead in the
search for the source." Meanwhile environmental health officials are
checking air conditioning systems. The search is likely to continue for the
next few days, but the Health Protection Agency (HPA) said it was possible
it would never be found.
GPs across the region have been alerted to the symptoms of the disease,
which include a flu-like illness with muscle aches, tiredness, headache,
dry cough, and fever. Samples have been taken from the confirmed cases to
see whether patients have caught the disease from the same source. Results
are expected early next week.
_Legionella pneumophila_, which causes the disease, is widely distributed
in the environment and found in hot and cold water, and air conditioning
systems in very small numbers. A hotline has been set up by NHS Direct to
deal with concerned members of the public on 01785 231011.
