The Kurdistan region has banned the import of animals and red meat from central and southern Iraq after the detection of bovine tuberculosis in Wasit, southeast of Baghdad.

Bovine TB is a contagious disease that can be transmitted to humans via meat or milk from infected cows. It can also spread throughout cattle herds and to other animals.

An official from Kurdistan's agriculture ministry said the ban will remain in place until they are confident that the disease has been brought under control by the Iraqi authorities. Authorities in Wasit slaughtered 1000 cows infected with the disease on 17 Jul 2017.

Dr. Miqdada Akrayi, the head of the livestock health department at the Kurdish ministry, told Rudaw that they have informed checkpoints and relevant parties that the import of animals and red meat from the centre and south of Iraq is banned, "unless the disease is treated and the situation comes under control." The ban came into effect on 20 Jul 2017.

He said that the Iraqi health ministry did not inform them about the disease "officially, but that we have done our unofficial follow up."

Animals imported from foreign countries should have a health license from their home authorities, Akrayi said, adding that animals would be kept for 21 days to make sure they do not carry any disease, including bovine TB.

Akrayi said the cattle disease is non-existent in the Kurdistan region, where they carry out continuous check-ups to prevent the spread of such diseases.

Dr. Khalid Ajyawi, a member of the Wasit Provincial Council said on 19 Jul 2017 that they will continue to check farms to detect any remaining infected cows in the province. He had said earlier that the affected cattle were slaughtered.

Ajyawi added that local authorities will help the infected farm get back to business, as it provides 80 jobs in the province. He added that the field no longer poses a health risk to the people or the livestock.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), TB is a public health priority in Iraq. It is among 7 countries in the region that has a high TB burden, accounting for 3 percent of the cases.

There are an estimated 20 000 TB patients in Iraq, according to the WHO, killing more than 4000 people annually.

[The slaughter of 1000 TB-infected cattle on a single day (17 Jul 2017) in Wasit may sound exceptional, but a visit to Iraq's semi-annual reports to the OIE on the WAHIS interface provides supporting evidence on the Iraqi bovine tuberculosis situation as presented in the Kurdish source; however, the slaughter date may have been inaccurate.

The WAHIS site "Detailed country's disease incidence," addressing bovine tuberculosis in Iraq since January 2016, presents the following data:

Date / location / susceptible animals / cases / deaths / killed & disposed of
October 2016 / Wasit / 18 / 6 / 6 / 0
November 2016 / Wasit / 2250 / 32 / 0 / 0
January 2017 / Wasit / 1931 / 725 / 0 / 725
March 2017 / Wasit / 1296 / 414 / 0 / 414

Details on the bTB event(s) in Wasit will be appreciated.

The given human-disease figures (20 000 cases with 4000 mortalities) need clarification. Iraq's information to the OIE on the occurrence of zoonotic diseases in humans during 2016 does not include bovine tuberculosis. The following 5 zoonoses are presented:

Disease / cases / deaths
Leishmaniasis / 1959 / 0
Brucellosis / 899 / 0
Toxoplasmosis / 645 / 0
Echinococcosis-hydatidosis / 455 / 0
Rabies / 17 / 17

Do the mentioned 20 000 human cases and 4000 mortalities relate to bovine TB, as may be apparent from the report, or rather to the total number of TB cases in humans, of which the majority, if not all, would have been caused by the human strain (_Mycobaterium tuberculosis_)?
