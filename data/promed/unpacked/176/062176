["The 2 outbreaks reported in the current report] occurred at commercial duck farms in Csongrad county in the south, where the birds had subclinical illness. All 195 652 birds were slated for culling. The country also reported 37 outbreaks at poultry farms, all in Bacs-Kiskun county, also in the south. The events began between 22 Mar and 30 Mar [2020], killing 4261 of 282 742 susceptible birds. The survivors will be destroyed to curb the spread of the virus. Though the source of the virus isn't known, investigators suggest that wind, high humidity, and human contact contributed to its spread."
