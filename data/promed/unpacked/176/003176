A comment
---------
I don't know whether or not it is of importance in the recent
outbreak in Angola, but in many parts of the developing world there
are a number of often bizarre "remedies" for rabies. It is my
understanding that only about half of rabid dogs shed the virus from
the salivary glands. Thus, half the time the remedies "work," not a
bad average for home remedies, so their use persists. Unfortunately,
by the time the failures get to valid medical assistance, it's too late!
