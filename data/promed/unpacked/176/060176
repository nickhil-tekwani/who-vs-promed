Hong Kong butcher infected by pig-borne disease
-----------------------------------------------
A Hong Kong butcher has contracted a pig-borne disease that has infected
over 200 people and killed 39 in southwestern China, triggering calls for
the city's government to expand curbs on pork imports from the mainland.
The 44-year-old man, who was not identified, is the 4th person to become
infected with the _Streptococcus suis_ bacterium in Hong Kong since the
outbreak in China was 1st reported in June 2005, and the 9th person to
catch the disease in the city in 2005.
The report of the new infection comes as fears grow that the disease has
spread from Sichuan province to other parts of China, which supplies much
of Hong Kong's food.
"The infected pork would have arrived at many kitchens here, putting many
housewives at risk," infectious disease expert Lo Wing-lok told Reuters on
Wed 17 Aug 2005. "If information is not forthcoming from the mainland, the
Hong Kong government should err on the safe side and ban imports from more
regions in China."
The butcher worked at Wellcome Supermarket, a leading Hong Kong supermarket
chain.
On Mon 15 Aug 2005, Hong Kong suspended imports of frozen pork from the
central Chinese province of Henan and the southern city of Shenzhen, which
borders Hong Kong. Chinese authorities have not explained why they recalled
a large amount of pork from Shenzhen, which originated from Henan.
The government has repeatedly rejected calls to halt imports of live pigs
from China, saying they come from registered farms and are tested by
veterinarians when they arrive.
Hong Kong's government refused to ban pork imports from Sichuan at the
start of the outbreak and admitted later that it chose not to do so because
it did not want to jeopardize relations with China. It was only later that
Chinese authorities suspended exports of Sichuan pork.
A spokeswoman for Wellcome said the supermarket chain buys its pork from a
Hong Kong government slaughterhouse, which in turn gets its supplies from
Ng Fung Hong, the city's major distributor of imported pork from China. The
spokeswoman said sales of pork had been suspended at the branch where the
butcher worked, but the meat was still on sale at its other locations.
"We're still trying to investigate how the butcher got infected," she told
Reuters.
The Hong Kong man had not traveled to China recently but had earlier cut
his finger, the Health Department said, urging people to wear gloves when
handling pigs or raw pork. He was admitted to the hospital on Tue 16 Aug
2005 with fever and pain in his finger and left thigh and is now in stable
condition.
Although the outbreak in China and infections in Hong Kong have led to a
fall in sales of pork here, some consumers do not appear to be unduly
worried. Pork is a staple meat in Chinese communities and is used in many
soups and dishes. "We just cook it longer now, but we still buy it," said
housewife Betty Ching, as she checked out a well-stocked pork counter at a
Wellcome store in eastern Hong Kong island.

China checks 2 pig-germ deaths
-----------------------------------
Authorities in east China's Jiangsu province say they are investigating the
deaths of 2 people who reportedly are suspected of having been infected
with a swine-borne disease that has killed 39 people. The men, one of them
said to be a butcher and the other a meat seller, died earlier in August
2005 at hospitals in Suzhou, the provincial capital, reports in the Hong
Kong and mainland media said.
An official at the Jiangsu Health Bureau, who refused to give her name,
confirmed on Wed 17 Aug 2005 that the cases were under investigation. But
she said the cause of the 2 deaths had not yet been confirmed. In
southwestern China's Sichuan province, 39 people have died since June 2005,
and more than 200 people have been infected with suspected or confirmed
cases of what the government says is a deadly strain of _S. suis_.
2 cases have been reported in southern China's Guangdong province since
June 2005, and neighboring Hong Kong has reported 3 such infections in the
past month [now 4, see above - Mod.LL]. But there have been no reports of
human-to-human infection: All cases reportedly involved contact with raw
pork or pigs. The outbreak of the disease has been a severe blow to China's
pork industry, especially in Sichuan, and officials appear to be seeking to
downplay worries over the potential risk to public health. Chinese
authorities typically are extremely cautious about releasing information on
such outbreaks. Chen Xiaokang, deputy director of Suzhou's Municipal Health
Bureau, said he wasn't able to release any information about the men's
deaths. "I don't have the right to release the result of the investigation
on whether there were _Streptococcus suis_ cases in Suzhou," Chen said.
According to a report in the 18 Aug 2005 edition of the state-run magazine
Oriental Outlook, the 1st man to fall ill was admitted to the hospital with
a high fever on 28 Jul 2005. He died on 2 Aug 2005, it said. The 2nd case
was hospitalized on 2 Aug 2005 and died a few days later, said the report,
citing relatives of the men who died and doctors working in the hospitals.
It said doctors did not immediately suspect the 1st patient had _S. suis_.
But when the 2nd man showed up with the same symptoms of fever and bleeding
under the skin, they began to treat it as a possible case.
