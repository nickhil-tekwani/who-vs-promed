Summary

The national veterinary service is investigating the reemergence of
FMD outbreaks in Albasrah [Basra] Province, southern Iraq. This
decision was made in response to an announcement from the local
veterinary agency indicating an increase in the number of reported
FMD outbreaks throughout the province. Additionally, the national
veterinary service announced that sufficient vaccine doses are
available in most veterinary hospitals across the country.
