Ringrot detected in Prince Edward Island seed potato fields
-----------------------
MONTAGUE -- Ringrot has been detected in tissue samples of a number
of Prince Edward Island seed potato farms resulting in their seed
crops being rejected by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA).
This means the seed crops can not be reused for seed stock in 2003
and must be sold either as tablestock or for processing. It also
means a major disinfection program is being implemented and that
affected land will be removed from potato growing for 2 years.

[The finding of Cms-infected seed potatoes in PEI seed potatoes is a serious
set-back to potato seed producers who have an enviable record of seed potato
production. Bacterial ring rot (a.k.a. ring rot) is an insidious disease
caused by _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ [Cms] (formerly
_Corynebacterium sepedonicum_). There is a zero tolerance for the pathogen
in seed potato production. Cms overwinters in tubers remaining in potato
fields or in storage facilities. The pathogen overwinters in tubers in
storage or in the ground and can multiply rapidly once it becomes
established. Cms also survives on potato handling equipment and other
items associated with production (bins, crates and burlap sacks). A
major pathway for entry into potato is during cutting of
infected/infested potatoes for planting. Potato is the only host that
is naturally infected although the bacterium can colonize sugar beet
roots without causing the disease.
Disease management involves disposal of all potato stocks by using
them for food or feed; disinfestation of equipment and ancillary
items; disposal of all potato sacks; at least 3 year crop rotation;
and use of resistant cultivars although there is the caveat that such
cultivars can often be symptomless carriers of Cms. - Mod.DH]
