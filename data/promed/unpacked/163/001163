An alert made by the municipal health department (Secretaria Municipal da Saúde; SMS) of Curitiba, to identify a man who delivered a bat to a municipal guard, in Rua da Cidadania do Pinheirinho, last Sunday [30 Jan 2022], had an effect. He presented himself at UPA [Unidade de Pronto Atendimento; emergency care unit] Sítio Cercado on Saturday [5 Feb 2022]. Tests on the bat showed it was infected with the rabies virus. Therefore, it was necessary to find the person who found the animal.

The man went to the UPA after learning from the media he was being sought. He had no complaints and also reported not touching the animal because he knew the risks. Even so, as a precaution, the SMS decided to administer rabies vaccine.

Rabies is a serious disease of high mortality, which affects all mammals, including humans, domestic and wild animals. Curitiba has not recorded cases of human and/or canine rabies for more than 30 years, but in 2010 a cat caught the disease after having contact with a bat.

Therefore, it is very important that the population remains attentive and, in case of unprotected contact with bats, seek medical advice as soon as possible.

Bats
----
Although they can harbor rabies virus and infect people, bats are extremely important because they contribute to the control of insects, spread seeds, and pollinate many plant species in the parks and squares of Curitiba. In addition, bats are part of the food chain of predators such as owls, some snakes and hawks. The bat found in Rua da Cidadania do Pinheirinho was of the family Vespertilionidae, genus _Eptesicus_, male, with lesions on the "wings" (torn, pierced). All bats have nocturnal habits -- that is, they go out to feed at night and are rarely found by day or on the ground.

However, when they are infected with the rabies virus, they can change their behavior and fly or be found by day. You should never touch a bat found in these conditions, even if it's dead.

What to do
----------
When finding a bat in an unusual situation (lying on the ground, indoors, hunted by dog and cat, among others), the indication is to isolate the place where the animal was found or contain it with a bucket, if it is on the ground. Next, it is recommended to register the removal request by calling 156 -- including weekends and holidays -- and wait for a technician from the zoonosis surveillance unit (Unidade de Vigilância de Zoonoses; UVZ) of SMS to make contact. "We advise the person does not try to capture the bat or in any way touch the animal", advises the coordinator of UVZ, Ana Paula Poleto.

A UVZ team goes to the site, removes the bat, vaccinates dogs and cats that may have had contact and gives guidance. Then the bat is referred for examination. The measure is part of the routine preventive work of UVZ, which also monitors suspicious dogs and cats when notified by veterinary professionals.

"UVZ's actions combined with the collaboration of the population are fundamental to keep the disease under control," says Ana Paula.

Vaccine
-------
For cats and dogs, the guideline is to keep them vaccinated against rabies. The vaccine should be given annually. Dogs and cats have hunting habits and may eventually come into contact with contaminated bats. "Even animals not having access to the streets should be vaccinated, since bats can enter houses and apartments and animals by hunting instinct come into contact", advises Ana Paula.

In addition to private clinics, vaccination for pets can be done at UVZ's headquarters at 1381 Lodovico Kaminski Street, CIC - Caiuá, Monday to Friday, from 8:00 am to 11:30 am and from 1:00 pm to 4:30 pm. You must, however, call ahead to schedule by phone (41) 3314-5210.

For humans, there is no indication for routine vaccination, except for professionals working in the area and with animal management, according to case-by-case evaluation by the epidemiology center of the SMS, based on the protocols of the Ministry of Health.

USA
[2] CDC warning: rise in rabies cases
Date: Fri 4 Feb 2022

https://www.cengnews.com/news/as-the-cdc-warns-of-a-rise-in-rabies-cases-children-find-a-rabid-bat-in-their-basement-241462.html


A mother from Pennsylvania revealed her children discovered a bat in their house which had rabies. The children discovered the bat in the basement, according to Bonnie Wilson of CBS affiliate WKBN in Sharon [PA]. Wilson said the bat was moving slowly and acting strangely, so she put it in a bucket and put it outside without touching it directly. She then put the bat in a container and called the game warden for assistance. Later, the animal was tested for rabies and found to be positive.

The announcement comes after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a warning about an increase in human rabies cases linked to bats. After 3 people in the United States, including a child, died from rabies between late September and early November 2021, the CDC issued a statement on 6 Jan 2022, saying it was "raising awareness" of the disease's risks from bats. In 2021, the US saw 5 rabies deaths, compared with none in 2019 and 2020.

Rabies is а deadly virus which attacks mammals' brains and spinal cords. The virus is usually passed from an infected animal to human beings through а bite. According to CDC, exposure to infected bats is the leading cause of human rabies deaths in the US, accounting for roughly 70% of all fatalities. Rabies can be prevented with prompt treatment after exposure, but the disease is almost almost fatal in human beings once symptoms appear.

According to CDC, human rabies cases are extremely rare in the US, with only 1 to 3 cases reported annually on average. In 2021, however, 3 people died of the disease in а 5-week period after coming into direct contact with bats in or round their homes; 1 in Idaho, 1 in Illinois, and 1 in Texas.

CDC determined 2 of the cases were "avoidable exposures". The patient in 1 case grabbed the bat with his bare hands. Rather than capturing the bat for testing, 2 of the 3 people released it. Furthermore, none of the 3 received post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), which is а series of shots which can prevent the spread of rabies [within the human body. - Mod.TG] if given before symptoms appear.

"We've come а long way in the United States in terms of reducing the number of people infected with rabies each year, but this recent spite of cases serves as а sobering reminder contact with bats poses а real health risk," said Ryan Wallace, а veterinarian and rabies expert with the CDC's Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology.

The number of rabid bats reported has remained constant since 2007, according to the National Rabies Surveillance System. According to the CDC, this suggests the rise in human rabies cases is due to а lack of knowledge about the illness's risks and the importance of PEP treatment.

As а result, CDC advises people to stay away from bats. Anyone who has had direct contact with а bat -- or suspects they have -- should contact their state or local health department or animal control for assistance in trapping the bat for testing. Alternatively, the individual can safely trap the bat on his or her own.

To determine whether PEP is required, the person should consult а doctor or а local public health official. "These precautions are necessary even if bat contact occurs through clothing and no bite or scratch marks are visible," according to CDC. "It's not always clear whether someone has had contact with а bat, such as when а bat is discovered in а room with а sleeping person or а child who has been left alone." Although bat bites do not always leave а visible mark, rabies can spread through infected saliva in some circumstances, such as when the skin is broken.

According to CDC, rabies symptoms usually appear after 3 weeks to 3 months. However, if PEP is given before this happens, it is nearly 100% effective at preventing the disease. CDC say over 60 000 people in the US receive PEP each year to stop the disease from progressing.

Roger Coup, wildlife manager for the Pennsylvania Game Commission's north west region, said there were 2 types of rabid animals to be on the lookout for when it came to the bat discovered by Bonnie Wilson's children. He told WKBN the first is an animal exhibiting aggressive behavior. The second is а motionless animal that appears disoriented or is salivating.

[3] Virginia (Arlington County): fox, pets, human exp
Date: Wed 2 Feb 2022

https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/local/virginia/virginia-rabid-fox-arlington-neighborhood-bites-person-and-pets/65-ed3f9e0f-e5ff-4a20-9ff5-c0191cc245ac


Residents in the Gulf Branch neighborhood of Arlington [Virginia] were on high alert after a rabid fox bit a person and 3 pets on Wednesday [2 Feb 2022]. The aggressive fox approached the victims in the 3500 block of N Utah Street and 4507 of 33rd Street North and it was briefly on the loose. The County asked neighbors to keep pets and children inside unless supervised while the fox was still out on the prowl.

Officials said onWednesday evening [2 Feb 2022] that a fox with a similar wound pattern on its back had been captured. Now, Arlington County Animal Control and the Arlington County Department of Human Services are urging anyone who may have been bitten or scratched by any wild animal, including a fox, to reach out immediately by calling Arlington County Animal Control. Be sure to reach out if any pets have been injured by a wild animal as well.

In the future, anyone who encounters the fox or any other wild animal are encouraged to pay attention to the following guidance from the county:
• Ensure pets are up to date on their rabies and distemper vaccines
• Keep dogs on a leash at all times and keep cats inside
• Do not approach or feed any wild animals
• Feed pets inside
• Remove wildlife attractants from yards, such as unsecured garbage cans, open containers of food and compost

"Do not attempt to haze or make loud sounds at [a possibly infected] animal. Back away slowly while facing the animal at all times," the county advised. "If you come across a deceased rabies vector animal (including cats, dogs, foxes, raccoons, and groundhogs) in your yard or a public space, contact Animal Control promptly and do not handle the animal."

[4] South Carolina (Greenwood County) horse, human exposure
Date: Thu 10 Feb 2022
Source: Outbreak News Today [edited]
http://outbreaknewstoday.com/south-carolina-horse-tests-positive-for-rabies-four-people-were-potentially-exposed-37449/


South Carolina health officials reported yesterday [9 Feb 2022] that a horse found near Thrush Road and Martin Towne Road in Ninety Six, SC, has tested positive for rabies. Four people were potentially exposed and have been referred to their healthcare providers for medical consultation.

South Carolina law requires all dogs, cats, and ferrets be vaccinated against rabies and revaccinated at a frequency to provide continuous protection of the pet from rabies using a vaccine approved by the department and licensed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Livestock are also susceptible to rabies and all livestock should be vaccinated with USDA approved rabies vaccinations. Cattle and horses, however, are the most frequently reported infected livestock species. Species for which licensed vaccines are not available, goat and swine, having frequent contact with humans or are considered valuable should also be vaccinated. [No rabies vaccine is licensed for goats in the US. However, there has been one long term study testing the Merial sheep rabies vaccine (Imrab®) on goats. - Mod.TG]

"Keeping your pets and livestock current on their rabies vaccination is a responsibility coming with owning an animal. It is one of the easiest and most effective ways you can protect yourself, your family, your pets, and your livestock from this fatal disease. That is an investment worth making to provide yourself some peace of mind," said Terri McCollister, DHEC's Rabies Program team leader.

This horse is the first animal in Greenwood County to test positive for rabies in 2022. There have been 4 cases of rabid animals statewide this year. Since 2002, South Carolina has averaged about 148 positive cases a year. In 2021, 3 of the 101 confirmed rabies cases in South Carolina were in Greenwood County.

[When you have been bitten, or gotten saliva of an animal with rabies in your eye, nose, mouth or a cut on your skin, a post-exposure prophylaxis series of shots is needed as a life-saving measure. Also, wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water. If you have had saliva in your eye, irrigate the eye with copious amounts of water, or flush the eye for several minutes. Seek appropriate medical care.

"Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) consists of a dose of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and rabies vaccine given on the day of the rabies exposure, and then a dose of vaccine given again on days 3, 7, and 14. For people who have never been vaccinated against rabies previously, postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) should always include administration of both HRIG and rabies vaccine. The combination of HRIG and vaccine is recommended for both bite and non-bite exposures, regardless of the interval between exposure and initiation of treatment.

"People who have been previously vaccinated or are receiving preexposure vaccination for rabies should receive only vaccine.

"Adverse reactions to rabies vaccine and immune globulin are not common. Newer vaccines in use today cause fewer adverse reactions than previously available vaccines. Mild, local reactions to the rabies vaccine, such as pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site, have been reported. Rarely, symptoms such as headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, and dizziness have been reported. Local pain and low-grade fever may follow injection of rabies immune globulin.

"The vaccine should be given at recommended intervals for best results. Talk to your doctor or state or local public health officials if you will not be able to have your shots at the recommended interval. Rabies prevention is a serious matter and changes should not be made in the schedule of doses. Patient assistance programs that provide medications to uninsured or underinsured patients are available for rabies vaccine and immune globulin.

"People cannot transmit rabies to other people unless they themselves are sick with rabies. PEP will protect you from developing rabies, and therefore you cannot expose other people to rabies. You can continue to participate in your normal activities." Extracted from https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/medical_care/index.html

Now there is a product called HyperRab. This is a recognized PEP and will likely reduce the number of shots required after an exposure to a rabid animal.

One of the articles mentioned a number of people dying from rabies. Please be cautious. Bats are notorious for carrying rabies. Do NOT handle bats. If you find one in your room, seek medical attention. People have been bitten by bats while sleeping and never known it. Exercise extreme caution if you are around bats. While bats are vital to our ecosystem, they can also easily be deadly to us.

Have your animals vaccinated against the rabies virus! Yes, vaccines are available for almost all our animals. If you have animals, or work with any mammalian animal, get them protected against rabies. This includes your dogs, cats, horse, and cows, sheep, goats and even pigs. While pigs are not as susceptible to the rabies virus, they can still get this disease. There are vaccines that have been tested and shown to be effective in swine although are not yet labeled for swine. Consult your veterinarian. But protect yourself and your livestock and pets from this disease. - Mod.TG
