New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Logan River, Queensland
Date of start of the outbreak: 22 Nov 2016
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: pond
Water type: salt water
Population type: farmed
Production system: semi-closed
Affected animals:
Species / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Giant tiger prawn (_Penaeus monodon_) (t) / 0 (scale 0 to 5) / 4 (scale 0 to 5) / - / - / - / - / - /

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: On [Tue 22 Nov 2016], a prawn farmer reported a minor mortality event with a small numbers of dead prawns, reduced feeding and some unusual swimming behavior. Samples were collected on [22 and 25 Nov 2016] and processed with routine priority. Higher mortalities were reported from one pond on [28 Nov 2016]. Positive PCR results from Queensland's Biosecurity Sciences Laboratory were reported on [30 Nov 2016] and confirmed by the Australian Animal Health Laboratory on [1 Dec 2016]. Measures to contain the disease to the affected farm have been applied. The disease response aims to eradicate the disease from the affected farm and confirm freedom in nearby farms and in wild crustaceans. The source of the outbreak is unknown.

Control measures
Measures applied: traceability; quarantine; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; stamping out; zoning; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: disinfection/disinfestation

["The causative agent of white spot disease is white spot syndrome virus, a large DNA virus assigned to the new genus _Whispovirus_ (family _Nimaviridae_). The virus infects only crustaceans and appears not to be related to any other known viruses. It is not involved in the parasitic disease, common in finfish, also known as white spot.

All decapod crustaceans (order Decapoda), including prawns, lobsters and crabs from marine, brackish, or freshwater environments, are considered susceptible to infection. However, the disease has mainly been a problem in farmed penaeid (family _Penaeidae_) prawns.

White spot disease has been officially reported from Bangladesh, Burma (Myanmar), Cambodia, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam" (http://library.enaca.org/Health/FieldGuide/pdf/White%20spot%20disease.pdf). - Mod.CRD
