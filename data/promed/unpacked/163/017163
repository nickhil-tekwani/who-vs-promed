Human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus - update - 5 Mar 2014
-------------------------
On [4 Mar 2014], the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified WHO of an additional laboratory-confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.

The patient is a 59 year-old man from Zhuhai City, Guangdong Province. He became ill on [26 Feb 2014], was admitted to a hospital on [1 Mar 2014] and died on [2 Mar 2014]. The patient has a history of exposure to live poultry.

The Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures:
- strengthen surveillance and situation analysis;
- reinforce case management and treatment; and
- conduct risk communication with the public and release information;

Sporadic human cases
The overall risk assessment has not changed (see WHO Risk Assessment under 'Related links').

The previous report of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus detection in live poultry exported from mainland China to Hong Kong SAR shows the potential for the virus to spread through movement of live poultry, at this time there is no indication that international spread of avian influenza A(H7N9) has occurred. However as the virus infection does not cause signs of disease in poultry, continued surveillance is needed.

Further sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection are expected in affected and possibly neighbouring areas.

Should human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is unlikely as the virus does not have the ability to transmit easily among humans. Until the virus adapts itself for efficient human-to-human transmission, the risk of ongoing international spread of H7N9 virus by travellers is low.
WHO advice

WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions.

As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.

WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.

[2] Hong Kong CHP 6 Mar 2014, 3 new cases: Guangdong (1), Jiangsu (1), Shandong (1, ex Jiangsu)

6 March 2014
CHP notified of three additional human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) in Mainland

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) received notification yesterday ([5 Mar 2014]) of a total of 3 additional human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) respectively in Guangzhou from the Health and Family Planning Commission of Guangdong Province; and in Jiangsu and Shandong from the National Health and Family Planning Commission.

The case in Guangzhou involves a man aged 75 who died on [1 Mar 2014]. The case in Jiangsu is a man aged 36. The case in Shandong is a man aged 59 with his disease onset in Jiangsu and he returned to Shandong afterwards. Both are hospitalised for treatment.

As of yesterday, a total of 374 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been confirmed in the Mainland, including Zhejiang (138 cases), Guangdong (83 cases), Jiangsu (43 cases), Shanghai (41 cases), Fujian (20 cases), Hunan (17 cases), Anhui (9 cases), Jiangxi (6 cases), Beijing (4 cases), Henan (4 cases), Guangxi (3 cases), Shandong (3 cases), Guizhou (1 case, imported from Zhejiang), Hebei (1 case) and Jilin (1 case).

"Locally, enhanced disease surveillance, port health measures and health education against avian influenza are ongoing. We will remain vigilant and maintain liaison with the World Health Organization (WHO) and relevant health authorities. Local surveillance activities will be modified upon the WHO's recommendations," a spokesman for the DH remarked.

"In view of human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) confirmed locally and multiple cases notified by the Mainland, further cases are expected in affected and possibly neighbouring areas. Those planning to travel outside Hong Kong should maintain good personal, environmental and food hygiene at all times," the spokesman urged.

"All boundary control points have implemented disease prevention and control measures. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks of inbound travellers. Random temperature checks by handheld devices have also been arranged. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up investigation," the spokesman added.

Regarding health education for travellers, display of posters in departure and arrival halls, in-flight public announcements, environmental health inspection and provision of regular updates to the travel industry via meetings and correspondence are proceeding.

The spokesman advised travellers, especially those returning from avian influenza-affected areas and provinces with fever or respiratory symptoms, to immediately wear masks, seek medical attention and reveal their travel history to doctors. Healthcare professionals should pay special attention to patients who might have had contact with poultry, birds or their droppings in affected areas and provinces.

Members of the public should remain vigilant and take heed of the preventive advice against avian influenza below:
- Do not visit live poultry markets and farms. Avoid contact with poultry, birds and their droppings. If contact has been made, thoroughly wash hands with soap;
- Avoid entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with surfaces which might be contaminated by droppings of poultry or other animals;
- Poultry and eggs should be thoroughly cooked before eating;
- Wash hands frequently with soap, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, handling food or eating; after going to the toilet or touching public installations or equipment (including escalator handrails, elevator control panels and door knobs); or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing;
- Cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing, hold the spit with a tissue and put it into a covered dustbin;
- Avoid crowded places and contact with fever patients; and
- Wear masks when respiratory symptoms develop or when taking care of fever patients.

The public may visit the CHP's avian influenza page (<www.chp.gov.hk/en/view_content/24244.html>) and website (<www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/global_statistics_avian_influenza_e.pdf>) for more information on avian influenza-affected areas and provinces.

[According to the most recent tally of confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) in China maintained by the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection, there have been 374 cases reported by 15 provinces (one province reported an imported cases). Zheijiang continues to be the most affected province, reporting 138 cases, followed by Guangdong reporting 83 cases.

According to the FluTrackers blog site, since the beginning of this outbreak in 2013, there have been a total of 385 laboratory confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) (see http://www.flutrackers.com/forum/showthread.php?t=202713 for details maintained on this blogsite).

To date the overwhelming majority of reported cases have a history of exposure to live poultry prior to onset of disease, with no evidence of significant human to human transmission.
