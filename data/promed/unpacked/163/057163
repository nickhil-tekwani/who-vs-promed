South Africa: new avian flu scare
---------------------------------
Agriculture officials will begin culling a further 4000 ostriches today [21
Sep 2004] after discovering a new pocket of avian flu among ostriches on a
farm near Fort Brown. Blood tests on the birds have confirmed the presence
of the deadly virus, and many of them were showing symptoms of the disease,
agriculture department spokesman Segoati Mahlangu said.
The Fort Brown farm had exchanged birds with farms in the area of the
original outbreak, near Somerset East, prior to the quarantine measures and
had initially been linked to the 1st farms by the department's forward and
backward tracing system. According to departmental policy, Mr Mahlangu
would not name the farm on which the ostriches tested positive, but it is
understood to be near Fort Brown, north of Grahamstown.
Residents of the area yesterday [20 Sep 2004] reported seeing a large pile
of dead ostriches on a farm. Mr Mahlangu insisted the culling had not yet
started, but he could not explain the reports. [If the reported pile was
indeed there, either significant mortality occurred in affected birds, or
culling was initiated by the owners themselves. - Mod.AS]. This is the 2nd
outbreak of the disease outside of the original 30 km radius control zone,
in the Somerset East district, since the virus was 1st detected in late
July 2004.
Some 2237 ostriches on 2 farms in the Salem area, south of Grahamstown,
were culled, along with poultry in the area, earlier this month [September
2004], when tests identified the virus there. These farms too had exchanged
birds and workers with the Somerset East farms. A total of 16 443 ostriches
were culled on 18 farms in the Somerset East control zone. The virus was
identified as the same H5N2 strain that killed chicken flocks in Asia last
year [2003]. [The current HPAI outbreak in Eastern Asia is caused by H5N1.
The only country which has reported a (mild) outbreak caused by H5N2 is
Taiwan; see 20040118.0202. - Mod.AS].
Mr Mahlangu said that it was not yet clear how many farms elsewhere had
purchased ostriches from infected farms in the control zone. "At this
stage, it's just those farms (in Salem and Fort Brown). The situation is
not static. We are still getting information, and serosurveillance (blood
testing) is continuing."
Any ostrich farm which had "recent" dealings with those in the control zone
would be investigated. Mr Mahlangu insisted that the disease had been
contained, however, and said that the Salem and Fort Brown cases were just
extensions of the original outbreak. "We have done countrywide
serosurveillance, and the disease has been found only in these 2 areas. We
have dealt with it successfully," he said. He conceded, though, that
testing on flocks elsewhere in the country had not been completed.
Officials, meanwhile, are busy with "mopping up" operations in the Somerset
East district, using a helicopter to look for stray flocks, or wild
ostriches, which might have missed the culling net.

[As stated in the last official report from South Africa to the OIE,
received 26 Aug 2004 [20040829.2416], 13 055 birds were destroyed, out of a
susceptible population totaling 16 000 on the affected farms; there were
1500 clinical cases, of which 1000 died. It further stated that "a
Controlled Area was established around Middleton in the Eastern Cape
Province, which consists of an inner Infected Area of a 5 km radius, a
middle Quarantine Area at 15 km, and an outer Surveillance Area at a 30 km
radius from the epicentre of infection". On 30 Aug 2004, the agriculture
department said that tests for bird flu on ostriches across the Somerset
East quarantine zone were completed, and, indicated the disease was
contained [see 20040831.2428].
In spite of the great and costly efforts exercised by the veterinary
authorities, unfortunately, eradication seems to still be ahead. Disease
control activities depend upon the effective cooperation of animal owners.
The current outbreak is the 2nd one outside the 30 km radius Surveillance
area. Earlier in September 2004, some 2237 ostriches on 2 farms in the
Salem area, south of Grahamstown, were culled, along with poultry, when
tests identified the virus there. In the current outbreak, near Fort Brown
(more than 100 km from the original outbreak at Middleton), 4000 ostriches
are to be culled. Both foci in September 2004 are said to have contracted
the virus by earlier trade contacts with the primary outbreaks. This might
mean that the virus had been around earlier than initially suspected.
An updated follow-up report is expected, including morbidity/mortality
figures, total number of affected farms, and the possible involvement of
commercial poultry farms. - Mod.AS].
