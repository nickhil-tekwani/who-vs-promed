Abstract
--------
Background
West Nile virus (WNV) was 1st sequenced in Brazil in 2019, when it was isolated from a horse in the Espírito Santo state. Despite multiple studies reporting serological evidence suggestive of past circulation since 2004, WNV remains a low priority for surveillance and public health, such that much is still unknown about its genomic diversity, evolution, and transmission in the country.

Methods
A combination of diagnostic assays, nanopore sequencing, phylogenetic inference, and epidemiological modeling are here used to provide a holistic overview of what is known about WNV in Brazil.

Results
We report new genetic evidence of WNV circulation in southern (Minas Gerais, São Paulo) and northeastern (Piauí) states isolated from equine red blood cells. A novel, climate-informed theoretical perspective of the potential transmission of WNV across the country highlights the state of Piauí as particularly relevant for WNV epidemiology in Brazil, although it does not reject possible circulation in other states.

Conclusion
Our output demonstrates the scarceness of existing data, and that although there is sufficient evidence for the circulation and persistence of the virus, much is still unknown on its local evolution, epidemiology, and activity. We advocate for a shift to active surveillance, to ensure adequate preparedness for future epidemics with spill-over potential to humans.

[West Nile virus arrived in North America in 1999 and has taken only 15 years or less to reach Brazil. With human and equine cases occurring in several states in Brazil in the past 6 years, it is likely that the virus has become established there. There is no doubt that West Nile virus is actively circulating in Brazil currently but is underreported. An earlier 9 Jan 2021 ProMED post reported, "genetic evidence of West Nile virus (WNV) circulation from southern and northeastern Brazilian states isolated from equine red blood cells. In the northeastern state, the 10th human case was also detected, presenting neuroinvasive disease compatible with WNV infection. Our analyses demonstrate much is still unknown on the virus' local epidemiology. We advocate for a shift to active surveillance, to ensure adequate control for future epidemics with spillover potential to humans" (1). (see West Nile virus (01): Americas, Brazil (SP, MG, PI) horse 20210109.8086240). Further research and greater surveillance efforts to document occurrence and epidemiological studies would make for greater understanding of the virus and its importance for human and equine health in Brazil.
