A disease that kills white-tailed deer has shown up in cattle herds in Jo Daviess County.

The Illinois Department of Natural Resources has received 47 reports this year [2015] of suspected cases of epizootic hemorrhagic disease [EHD] in wild, white-tailed deer, according to a press release.

EHD cases in deer have been reported in Stephenson County and 16 other counties, and while no such cases have been reported in Jo Daviess County, EHD has been reported in cattle there, the release states.

The disease is transmitted between deer by a midge. Infected animals develop a high fever, and the dead often are found near water sources, the DNR states. It can cause "localized die-offs when conditions are favorable for transmission," the release states. EHD also can affect livestock.

Residents are asked to contact their local DNR field office of the Illinois Wildlife Disease and Invasive Species Program if they find deer they suspect died due to EHD.

[EHD is most commonly found in cervids. However, several cases have occurred finding EHD or EHD2 in cattle.

"The epizootic hemorrhagic disease viruses belong to the genus _Orbivirus_, family Reoviridae. Ten serotypes of EHDV are known worldwide. The viruses of the EHDV serogroup are transmitted by biological vectors, usually biting midges in the genus _Culicoides_. In North America, _C. variipennis_ is the major vector. Some species of gnats and mosquitoes can also transmit EHDV. Infected deer can be viremic for up to 2 months. The incubation period for epizootic hemorrhagic disease in deer is 5 to 10 days.

Disease in cattle is characterized by fever, anorexia, and difficulty swallowing. The swallowing disorders are caused by damage to the striated muscles of the pharynx, larynx, esophagus and tongue, and may lead to dehydration, emaciation, and aspiration pneumonia. Edema, hemorrhages, erosions, and ulcerations may be seen in the mouth, on the lips, and around the coronets. The animals may be stiff and lame, and the skin may be thickened and edematous. Abortions and stillbirths have also been reported in some epidemics. Most EHDV infections in cattle appear to be subclinical.

Typical signs include fever, oral ulcers, salivation, lameness associated with coronitis, and weight loss. In pregnant cows, the fetus may be resorbed or develop hydranencephaly if it is infected between 70 and 120 days of gestation. Deaths are uncommon with the North American strains of EHDV; however, some animals may be lame and unthrifty for a prolonged period. Epizootic hemorrhagic disease has not been reproduced in experimentally infected cattle; although animals become viremic, they remain asymptomatic.

Preferred tissues in deer are spleen, lymph node, and unclotted whole blood in EDTA or heparin. Other useful samples may include serum (for serology), liver, and lung. Both fresh and fixed tissues should be collected if possible. Samples for virus isolation should be transported under refrigeration. For suspect cases in cattle, blood should be collected into anticoagulant (calcium citrate, EDTA, or heparin) and sent chilled for virus isolation or RT-PCR. Paired serum samples should also be collected if possible. Additionally, because of other differentials, involved fluid from intact vesicles as well as aggressive swabs or biopsy samples near lesions are also suggested.

Should questions arise, please feel free to contact any of the diagnosticians at the ISU-VDL (515-294-1950)."
