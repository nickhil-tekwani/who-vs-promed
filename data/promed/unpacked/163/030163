Farms hit by citrus disease
---------------------------
The citrus greening disease, which almost wiped out hundreds of orange
orchards in the coastal areas in this division several years ago, has
apparently made a comeback. The disease, spread by infected psyllids, has
again been detected in many citrus farms. Some 1900 ha of land here have
infected orange trees.
State Agriculture Department deputy director Paul Vincent Ritom said
farmers should destroy infected citrus trees. "Farmers should carry out
preventive measures by spraying their fruit trees with chemicals on a
regular basis," he added. Ritom said the department had, after the last
outbreak of the disease in the late 1990s, issued guidelines on how to
control the disease.
During a visit to the Agriculture Department office here on Thursday [31
Mar 2005], Deputy Chief Minister and Minister for Modernization of
Agriculture Tan Sri Dr. George Chan Hong Nam advised farmers to strictly
follow the department's instructions to keep the disease in check.
Ritom said the department had provided disease-free citrus seedlings to
farmers, adding that some 600 ha had been planted.
"Samarahan has produced some 7500 tons of oranges so far this year [2005],
and it has the potential to produce 20 000 tons a year," he added.

[Huanglongbing (HLB) a.k.a. citrus greening is caused by 2 species of
_Liberobacter_ (_L. asiaticum_ and _L. africanum_). Samarahan is situated
about 40 km from Kuching. Kota Samarahan is the administration center for
the areas of Asajaya dan Muara Tuang. Disease management includes heat
treatment to eradicate the pathogen in budwood. The most effective method
of preventing the disease is to control the insect vectors (_Diaphorina
citri_ in Asia, and _Trioza erytreae_ in Africa). Agricultural practices,
including the careful selection of vector-free production areas, good crop
husbandry, and careful selection of trees, are key to successful management.
The HLB bacterium can cause catastrophic losses of an important crop.
Infection rates of up to 95 percent have been seen in Thailand, and crop
losses of 100 percent have been reported in some areas of South Africa,
resulting in destruction of entire crops.
