[1] Liberia: new Ebola cases confirmed

On Fri 20 Nov 2015, 3 new cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were diagnosed. A 10-year-old boy, who lives with his 3 siblings and parents in Paynesville (east of Monrovia), was the 1st newly diagnosed with EVD, and 2 direct family members have subsequently been diagnosed with EVD. The boy was 1st admitted to the John F. Kennedy Medical Center in Monrovia, in isolation, with symptoms of fever, weakness and bleeding. He was transferred to the Paynesville Ebola Treatment Unit [ETU] on Wed 18 Nov 2015.

All 6 family members and other high-risk contacts are now being cared for in an Ebola Treatment Unit in Paynesville. According to Liberia's Health Minister, Bernice Dahn, "The hospital is currently decontaminating the [ETU] unit. All of the healthcare workers who came in contact with the patient have been notified."

According to Bruce Aylward, head of the Ebola response for the World Health Organization (WHO), the boy had no known contact with any person with EVD. Aylward also said 2 of the index patient's siblings have been diagnosed positive for EVD.

Liberia was 1st declared free from EVD on 9 May 2015, but EVD flared up again with 4 EVD-positive patients in late June 2015. Two of those patients died from EVD. Liberia was again declared EVD-free on 3 Sep 2015. To date, EVD has killed approximately 11 300 people in West Africa.

[Either the index case was exposed through a former Ebola case who continues to shed virus, by attending a funeral where the corpse was shedding virus, or though exposure to infected wildlife. The 1st 2 appear to have been eliminated as possible causes. This is a discouraging setback, but the Liberian government has responded fully to the new case. Ebola likely is endemic/enzootic in West Africa, and the health care system must maintain vigilance and act quickly and decisively to keep the virus under control. It will be difficult to eliminate Ebola virus completely in the immediate future with the understanding we now have of viral persistence. Viral nucleic acid was detected in the semen of 26 per cent of 43 recovered men who had a specimen obtained 7-9 months after onset (G.F. Deen, B. Knust, N. Broutet et al., Ebola RNA Persistence in Semen of Ebola Virus Disease Survivors -- Preliminary Report. N Engl J Med. 14 Oct 2015; http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa1511410). It is still not clear what proportion of these individuals have infectious virus present. - Mod.LK]

Vaccines
-------
18 Nov 2015: Study finds that Ebola vaccine is safe and stimulates strong immune response
http://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-11-ebola-vaccine-safe-strong-immune.html
[According to a study published in the latest issue of the journal Lancet Infectious Disease, a clinical trial of a new Ebola vaccine (ChAd3-EBO-Z) has found that it is well tolerated and stimulates strong immune responses in adults in Mali, West Africa and in the US. Larger trials, sponsored by GSK Biologicals, have already started.

The full reference is: MD Tapia, SO Sow, KE Lyke. Use of ChAd3-EBO-Z Ebola virus vaccine in Malian and US adults, and boosting of Malian adults with MVA-BN-Filo: a phase 1, single-blind, randomised trial, a phase 1b, open-label and double-blind, dose-escalation trial, and a nested, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. 2015. _The Lancet Infectious Diseases_.

19 Nov 2015 Cameroon: Gov't bows to pressure, halts Ebola vaccine trials
http://www.cameroonjournal.com/govt-bows-to-pressure-halts-ebola-vaccine-trials/
[According to a national broadcast on 19 Nov 2015, the government has indefinitely suspended the ongoing clinical trials in Cameroon at the Bamenda Regional Hospital and the Center Pasteur laboratory in Yaounde. Though a reason for the suspension of the trials has not been given, it is believed the government was yielding to pressure from activists.]

Research
-----
Kucharski, A.J., Camacho, A., Flasche, F. et al. (17 Nov 2015). Measuring the impact of Ebola control measures in Sierra Leone, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, vol. 112 no. 46 14366-14371. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1508814112.

[Significance. Between June 2014 and February 2015, thousands of Ebola treatment beds were introduced in Sierra Leone, alongside other infection control measures. However, there has been criticism of the timing and focus of this response, and it remains unclear how much it contributed to curbing the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic. Using a mathematical model, we estimated how many Ebola virus disease cases the response averted in each district of Sierra Leone. We estimated that 56 600 (95 per cent credible interval: 48 300-84 500) Ebola cases were averted in Sierra Leone as a direct result of additional treatment beds. Moreover, the number of cases averted would have been even greater had beds been available 1 month earlier.]

[The authors found that the effect varied considerably by district, with large impacts in districts with large outbreaks, and noted the highly variable nature of Ebola transmission. -Mod.LK]

Technology
--------
17 Nov 2015: Xenex Germ-Zapping Robot destroys Ebola virus & Anthrax spores in new study performed at Texas Biomed Biosafety Level 4 Lab
http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151117006753/en/Xenex-Germ-Zapping-Robot%E2%84%A2-Destroys-Ebola-Virus-Anthrax
[The study validates the effectiveness of pulsed Xenon UV light disinfection technology on Ebola virus and Anthrax. In Texas Biomed's BSL-4 lab, the Xenex robot destroyed both Ebola and anthrax spores on surfaces, achieving a greater-than-4-log reduction of Ebola in 1 minute, and a greater than 3-log reduction in anthrax spores in 15 minutes. In none of the time/distance combinations was either anthrax or Ebola detected after the Xenex device was used. The study was done using live Ebola virus and _Bacillus anthracis_.]

Funding
------
17 Nov 2015 Sierra Leone: Ebola-free Sierra Leone receives IMF recovery funds
http://www.publicfinanceinternational.org/news/2015/11/ebola-free-sierra-leone-receives-imf-recovery-funds
[The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved a USD 46.14 million disbursement to Sierra Leone for its recovery from the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak.]

18 Nov 2015 Sierra Leone: U.S., Sierra Leone Sign USD 44.4 million agreement
http://allafrica.com/stories/201511190850.html
[On Tue 17 Nov 2015, the United States (US) government, through the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), signed a USD 44.4 million partnership grant agreement with the government of Sierra Leone to support the country's threshold programs. These programs include policy reforms, institutional capacity building, and improved governance, water and electricity sectors (with focus on Freetown), within 4 years.

[An expert panel has recommended to WHO (World Health Organization) Director Dr. Margaret Chan [the formation of] a separate entity within the WHO to handle both outbreaks and emergencies.]
