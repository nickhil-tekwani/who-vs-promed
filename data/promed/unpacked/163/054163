The press-service of the Southern inter-regional management of the Ministry
of extreme situations of Kyrgyzstan has reported that an inhabitant of the
village of Talaabulak in the rural area of Kysylkuu in the Suzakskiy
district of the Jalalabad region was hospitalized on 11 Dec 2006 in the
Suzakskiy district hospital on suspicion of anthrax.
According to Iljas Ashurov, press-secretary of the Ministry of Emergency
Measures of Kyrgyzstan, the diagnosis has not yet been confirmed.

[In the mass media of Kyrgyzstan some reports of suspected anthrax in
humans also appeared in August -- September 2006. In total, there was
information on 5 cases of suspected anthrax in 2 administrative territories
of the republic. However, confirmation or denials of this diagnosis as a
result of laboratory investigations have not appeared in the Internet mass
media - Mod.NP
Jalal-Abad is enzootic for cattle anthrax in Kyrgyzstan and the oblast
wraps itself around eastern Uzbekistan, which is similarly afflicted. So
this report is not surprising except that by December one expects the
incidence to have dropped off to near zero, at least in livestock. Without
other details one might assume that this is a normal result of a villager
butchering an animal moribund or dead from anthrax, which unfortunately is
the commonest cause of this disease in humans in Central Asia. Further
details have been requested from colleagues in Bishtek. To get an idea of
the location of this village is, go to:
