11 Children Died in Hospital of the City of Khabarovsk
----------------------------------
In the hematology section of Khabarovsk regional hospital 11 children have died in several days.
All the patients in the hematology section took an up-to-date German
medicine. Death was a result of numerous internal hemorrhages.
Infection or overdose of the preparation are excluded. Children aged 1-
17 years have died.
The oncohematological centre in Khabarovsk is the best in Russia.
Children with the most serious forms of cancer are being treated here.
Neither the AIDS commission nor the regional centre of sanitary
epidemic inspectors has found anything. The main current explanation
of what has happened is the unusual heat in Khabarovsk. In unofficial
comments doctors say the children weakened by illness and
chemotherapy simply could not bear these unusually hot days.

[This article does not give many details of the fatal illnesses other than
suggesting an increase in hemorrhagic manifestations, which may relate
to the marked thrombocytopenia seen with chemotherapy. ProMED-
mail would appreciate more information on this occurrence. -
