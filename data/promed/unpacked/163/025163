Situation summary: Data published on 14 Jan 2015
-----------------------------------------
Total in the 3 epidemic countries (Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone) as of 11 Jan 2015:
- 21 261 cases
- 8414 deaths
- 1047 cases in the past 21 days [Another version of the WHO report states 1798 cases in the last 21 days and 841 deaths. I do not know what accounts for this discrepancy, as the cumulative case number is the same. - Mod.LK]
- 10 124 total (confirmed, probable and suspected) cases (3062 deaths) confirmed in Sierra Leone alone.

WHO sitrep.
Guinea reported its lowest weekly total of new confirmed Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases since the week ending 17 Aug 2014. Case numbers remain low in Liberia, with no confirmed cases nationally for the final 2 days of the week ending 11 Jan 2015, and the lowest weekly total of confirmed cases since the 1st week of June 2014. Sierra Leone has now reported a decline in case incidence for the 2nd week running and recorded its lowest weekly total of new confirmed cases since the week ending 31 Aug 2014.

See:
Figure 4: Geographical distribution of new and total confirmed and probable* cases in Guinea, Liberia, Mali and Sierra Leone, and

Figure 5. Location of Ebola Treatment Centres and capacity to isolate probable and confirmed cases by district in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.

The cumulative case fatality rate in the 3 intense-transmission countries among all probable and confirmed cases for whom a definitive outcome is recorded is 71 percent. For those patients recorded as hospitalized, the case fatality rate is 57 percent in Guinea, 58 percent in Liberia, and 60 percent in Sierra Leone (tables 3-5).

A total of 843 health-care workers (HCWs) are known to have been infected with EVD up to the end of 11 Jan 2015 in all affected and previously affected countries. 500 HCWs have died. Figures for the 3 intense-transmission countries are shown in table 6 [Table 6 figures differ from the text that accompanies the table, showing 825 cases in HCWs with 493 deaths. - Mod.LK].

[2] Sierra Leone: burials
Date: Tues 13 Jan 2015
Source: Sky News [edited]
http://news.sky.com/story/1407199/ebola-we-cant-dig-graves-quickly-enough


Sky News visited a graveyard where 300 babies have been buried in a week as a nearby community is put in quarantine. Armed soldiers and police stand guard at Sima village just outside Kerry Town to ensure no one breaches the quarantine.

There is a thin red string that separates the people who could be carrying the deadly Ebola virus.

Nearly 50 people who lived here have already been taken to hospital with Ebola symptoms; 10 have died. Now, their relatives, friends and everyone they came in contact with have effectively been put under house arrest for 21 days, the Ebola incubation period. When we saw them, it was only day 6 of their quarantine, and tempers were already fraying. They haven't been allowed to shop or farm, so they are hungry and angry.

An argument breaks out as some of the younger men behind the string barrier complain about being ignored. "They haven't let us out for 6 days, and if we complain, they beat and shove us," one shouts to us. "We all feel fine."

As we are there, British aid arrives. There are huge bundles of food and provisions, including a water carrier, provided by Plan International, but it's piled up in lines just beyond the red string as the distributors try to match names on their lists with the hoards of people behind the barrier.

After some delay, they begin handing it out to the visibly grateful people.

The next few weeks will be tortuous for this community as they wait to find out whether they too are going to succumb to Ebola. The scale of this scourge is evident at the Kingtom burial site run by the Irish charity Concern. They dig 50 graves a day and still often can't keep up with the demand. "We average about 50 a day."

They can't clear this former dump quickly enough to cope with the dead. Unsafe burials of Ebola victims are believed to be responsible for up to 70 percent of new infections, so now every death is treated like an Ebola death. The authorities don't wait for confirmation.

The burial teams suit up to protect themselves, but the danger is never far from their thoughts. Every body the authorities retrieve is double wrapped and sealed in thick plastic bags with copious disinfectant used. By the end of the day, all the graves will be filled.

Sierra Leone hasn't resorted to cremations like neighbouring Liberia -- they are disliked on cultural grounds -- and people continue to prepare and bury their loved ones themselves in secret to avoid what they see as this indignity.

Alongside the graves, the burial teams disinfect, burn and then bury all their outer layers of protective clothing. They know that with all their precautions, the risk has been greatly reduced, but they go through this procedure about 8 times a day, and complacency could mean contamination.

It has taken just 8 days for a huge number of tiny graves to build up that are all babies or toddlers. A stick represents a body, and some graves have multiple sticks to one mound. The charity estimates that there have been about 300 babies buried here in just over a week.

[3] Region: Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon)
Date: Wed 14 Jan 2015
Source: Eye Witness News [edited]
http://ewn.co.za/2015/01/14/Afcon-to-start-following-Ebola-controversy


The Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) finally gets underway on Sat [17 Jan 2015] after a controversial build-up to the 30th edition, which included a hasty late switch of hosts to Equatorial Guinea in the wake of concerns over the Ebola virus.

16 nations again line up for the biennial continental championship, seeking Africa's top sporting prize at the tournament, which starts on Sat [17 Jan 2015] and finishes on 8 Feb [2015].

Few previous editions have had such a dramatic backdrop, with the hosting of the 2015 finals being switched 2 months ago after Morocco asked for a postponement in the wake of the spread of the Ebola virus in West Africa. That request precipitated a crisis that left the tournament having to be organised almost from scratch in a few weeks.

Fears that travelling fans could spread Ebola and damage Morocco's tourist industry were seen as alarmist by the Confederation of African Football (CAF), who rejected the request and then stripped Morocco of their hosting rights.

From a country with plentiful resources, who have previously bid to host the World Cup, Afcon is now being played in one of Africa's smallest and most enigmatic countries.

Equatorial Guinea is a family-ruled former Spanish colony which has newfound oil wealth and is reveling in rescuing the continent's most eagerly anticipated sporting event. ... - more

[4] Costs
Date: Wed 14 Jan 2015
Source: The Atlantic [edited]
http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/01/ebola-sierra-leone-hunger-farming/384515/


On 3 Sep 2014, AN learned by phone that her son was dead and that there would be no burial. He had died of Ebola. AN is a nurse in the Kono district of Sierra Leone, and when her son had fallen ill, she had diligently followed disease-prevention protocol and brought him to the local hospital. Nonetheless, not long after she learned of his death, police officers wearing blue protective gowns over their camouflage uniforms arrived at her family compound in the village of Borbodu and nailed a flimsy wooden bar across the entrance. For 21 days, AN and 17 family members were quarantined inside.

Behind the barrier, AN agonized over the immediate trauma; as she watched some of her other children get sick, she feared for their lives and her own. But she also worried about what would sustain the family should they survive. Rice is the staple food in Sierra Leone, and her 8 acres of swampland needed to be planted with the crop before it was too late in the season. Though she and her family had the seed, they couldn't leave the compound to put it in the ground. Normally other villagers would help, but people didn't want to risk catching Ebola by working the quarantined family's field. As is the case for most of Sierra Leone's rural population -- roughly 60 percent of the West African nation's 6 million people -- the food on AN's table is largely what is grown on her farm. If the crop wasn't planted, what would her family eat?

Even as Ebola infection rates appear to be leveling off in the country, the disease's less visible but long-term impacts on communities and the economy are taking shape. On 17 Dec [2014], the UN Food & Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Food Program estimated that 120 000 Sierra Leoneans have become "food insecure" as a result of Ebola, meaning they neither have the food they need nor are able to buy it. By March [2015], the report predicted, the number will rise to 280 000. In other words, the number of people in Sierra Leone who have died from Ebola -- just over 3000 to date -- will be only a fraction of the number who will go hungry from it.

This is in large part because Ebola poses an almost impossible quandary in Sierra Leone, where the outbreak has taken the greatest human toll. Prevention of the disease requires people to distance themselves from one another. But agriculture, the country's lifeblood, relies on people coming together. If the quintessential image of American farming is a lone figure riding a tractor or a combine, the picture in Sierra Leone is instead dozens of men and women using machetes, shovels, and their bare hands. As they touch, talk, and sweat their way across a field, the work they do is inherently connective.

"Farming unites us," explained Bondu Lebbe, the president of the Kono Women's Cooperative, a marketing collective whose aim is to empower its 5000 female members. (AN is a chairwoman.) Before Ebola, the cooperative would normally assemble 100 or 200 people at a time to work in members' fields. "It's not like in Europe," she told me. "When we go to the farm, we come together. We talk about our families. We solve our problems. We give courage to each other."

Over the past year, farming in much of Sierra Leone has been hindered by the disconnection Ebola demands and the distrust that disconnection breeds. In telephone interviews, farmers and agricultural officials described the same scenarios repeatedly. Many farmers are afraid to hire the additional hands they need for planting, weeding, and harvesting, thinking outsiders might bear the disease. Many workers fear farmers, like AN, whom they suspect of having some link to Ebola. And the seasonal migration of laborers has been obstructed by lockdowns that force people to stay in one place and blockades that impede movement when migration is allowed.

Even when manpower is available, critical mass is hard to achieve. In most cases, the government has prohibited gatherings of more than 5 people. Lebbe said that her planting crews are now small, and in the field, people keep their distance from one another. But that is better than nothing at all. In the areas hardest hit by Ebola, an uncounted number of farms lie fallow because farmers died, because farm families were shattered by death, or because people simply abandoned their land, having run away to escape the threat of disease or the pain of losing loved ones to it. Rice has gone unplanted in some places and unharvested in others. Where labor was in short supply to defend against weeds, rodents, and birds, yields have suffered. Some areas unscathed by Ebola have still struggled: Even as farmers have harvested good crops of rice and other foods, they have been challenged to sell them because markets are closed and roads are blocked.

This shortfall in agricultural production and income is not the isolated concern of the farming sector, as it might be in the United States. That's because Sierra Leone's farming sector is, in effect, the country: It employs 2/3rd of the population and produces 46 percent of GDP, more than any other sector. Most importantly, agriculture constitutes the nation's primary food source, much of it delivered directly from field to table. When a rice crop fails, the impact is often hunger.

Liberia and Guinea are in similar predicaments, and the FAO/WFP report predicted that by March 2015, the 3 countries may have one million people who are food insecure as a result of Ebola. But the suffering is not yet obvious, said Vincent Martin, head of the FAO's Subregional Hub for Resilience and Emergency in Dakar. "People in rural areas have coping strategies," he explained. "So people will last for some time, up to the point where they will take all the reserves they have. Seeds they were supposed to use for planting next season, they will eat them."

Martin and others at the FAO believe that a hunger epidemic can be avoided through a series of preventive measures. Supplementary food imports can be purchased and micro-loans granted to farmers whose harvests allowed them only enough to eat, not enough to sell for income. Extension workers, who provide agricultural education to the public, can help people plant fast-producing vegetables and supply chickens for eggs. Already, the FAO's office in Sierra Leone is planning to buy and distribute seed rice to farmers who have none.

The challenge is that all of this requires money, which the nation's devastated economy cannot provide. International donors have mobilized to fight Ebola, but raising money for preventive measures is much harder.

"You don't wait for a crisis to come!" Joseph Sesay, Sierra Leone's minister of agriculture, told me with a note of exasperation. "People only become sympathetic when a crisis itself is here, but we are trying to explain to donors that they shouldn't wait until Ebola is over to provide funds for agriculture. Otherwise, the next crisis will be a food crisis."

And yet Sierra Leone's fate is not entirely in the hands of these donors. As Sesay explained, international aid is meant to temporarily fill gaps in the harvest and bolster an agricultural system weakened by disease. The solution in the long term must come from within the country. "People will not think life is normal," Sesay said, "until agriculture is normal."

Some hope lies in the story of AN. While she and her family were quarantined, Lebbe and other leaders of the Kono Women's Cooperative brought them food to supplement the spartan rations the government had supplied. They gave AN mobile-phone credit and, from across the barrier, offered comfort and encouragement. "Bondu behaved to me like a mother, and all the other women treated me like a sister," AN said. "They were always by my side."

But perhaps the most valuable support they gave was going to AN's rice farm when no one else would. The women organized themselves into small groups that worked on successive days. By phone, AN reminded them to stay clear of one another in the field and wash their hands with chlorine. One cooperative member recalled that instead of talking and singing, the women quietly prayed for AN. Some villagers overcame their fear and joined the effort. When the group was finished, all 8 acres had been planted with short-season red rice.

In the months that followed, Ebola surged through Kono district. In early December [2104], the World Health Organization found the local hospital overwhelmed by infections and death. The entire district was quarantined for 3 weeks. By New Year's, the International Red Cross was calling Kono a new hotspot for the disease. So when the women gather in January [2015] to harvest this rice by hand, it will be more than hard work; it will be an act of courage and resolve. They are buoyed, in part, by the fact that AN will be there in the field alongside them.

After quarantine, AN's entire family tested negative for Ebola. They still carry some stigma, as if somehow the virus were following them, but AN has returned to her life as best she can. As a nurse, she is leading education campaigns about Ebola prevention. As a farmer, she is preparing for harvest.

She said the swampland's crop looks healthy but predicts the yields this month [January 2015] will be low; even though the women were able to plant, there was simply not enough help to cultivate the field properly and scare away birds. But at least when AN goes out to the field, there will no longer be a need for others to pray for her. Instead, the familiar work of cutting, bundling, and threshing will become a prayer itself: for the survival of her family, the strength of her community, and the healing of her nation.

[The collateral damage from the Ebola epidemic is far reaching and clearly goes beyond the disease itself. This article points to a major issue to be addressed, i.e., disruption of food production. Also see, from 14 Jan 2015, "Ebola hits household hard" http://www.voanews.com/content/ebola-world-bank-14jan15/2597984.html.

A World Bank study conducted using a high frequency cell phone survey indicates that at the household level, nearly half of Liberian heads of households are out of work, while in Sierra Leone, many in urban areas have lost their jobs.

It is clearly critical for the global community to maintain support of countries affected by Ebola even while feeling relief that the situation is beginning to become resolved. - Mod.LK]
