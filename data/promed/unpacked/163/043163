Emerging Swine Disease Tightens Gap between Producers and Scientists
-----------------------------------------------
A new disease has taken swine producers, veterinarians and scientists
across the country by surprise and left them searching for solutions.
Formerly known as Post-weaning Multisystemic Wasting Syndrome (PMWS),
Porcine Circovirus Associated Diseases (PCVAD) were discovered in the
early 1990s by 2 Canadian veterinarians, John Harding and Ted Clark,
said Lisa Tokach, an Abilene, Kansas veterinarian. Harding and Clark
associated the disease with an increased mortality rate in weaning pigs.
"The 1st PCVAD case in Kansas was discovered in November 2005, and
now we're seeing new cases almost every week," Tokach said. "It is
highly contagious and is spreading fast." She gave a presentation on
PCVAD at Kansas State University's annual Swine Industry Day in November, 2006.
The PCVAD name was suggested by the American Association of Swine
Veterinarians (AASV) after the discovery of Porcine Circovirus type 2
(PCV2). PCVAD can be used to describe all of the diseases attributed
to porcine circovirus, including PMWS.
The PCV2 disease was discovered when swine practitioners began
reporting an increased number of PMWS cases in finisher pigs. Through
research trials and field cases, scientists discovered that the PCV2
disease was contributing to the increased presentation of PMWS in
these swine herds.
Unlike diseases such as West Nile Virus, PCVAD is species specific,
meaning it doesn't spread to other species, but other types of
circoviruses have been found in birds, Tokach said.
It's predicted that every swine herd in the United States is
"infected" with PCVAD, however, not all herds are "affected," she
said. "Infected" means that porcine circovirus type 2 is present in
the herd, but clinical signs may not be present, whereas, "affected"
means that the herd is displaying symptoms associated with the virus.
Environmental conditions and the presence of other pathogens or
diseases may be contributing factors, explaining the difference
between "infected" herds and "affected" herds. However, it is not yet
clear what drives the disease.
PCVAD depletes the lymph node system, leaving the pig with no defense
against other pathogens. When the pig becomes infected with another
pathogen or disease, its body can't defend itself, so most
PCVAD-affected pigs die, Tokach said.
"We're still learning a lot about PCVAD, but we do know that it is a
viral condition in swine caused by PCV2, and it seems to have a wide
variety of symptoms," she said.
She has been working closely with swine producers and a team of
K-State scientists who are studying PCVAD and other infectious
diseases that affect it to find possible solutions.
K-State scientists are conducting field studies and laboratory
diagnostics, developing a disease model, and working with swine
producers to test PCV2 vaccines, said Bob Rowland, virologist for
K-State's College of Veterinary Medicine.
"This is definitely a new approach to infectious disease research, in
which we're working closely with vets and producers," Rowland said.
"The producers have been extraordinary in helping us out, since labs
tend to be isolated, and with PCV2, much of my success in research
depends heavily on field studies. For the 1st time, we're getting
e-mails from producers and are developing relationships with them.
This has given us a sense of urgency to develop solutions so
producers can recover their profitability. Their long term success is
dependent on our research success."
K-State has received approximately USD 70 000 in research grants from
the National Pork Board and from agriculture experiment station
funding, Rowland said. Scientists expect to have the vaccination
study finished in about a month, but they are not sure when a vaccine
will be available in sufficient amounts for producers to purchase.
"From a practitioner point-of-view, I'm seeing farmers lose up to 20
percent of their finisher pigs," Tokach said. "This disease is not
only economically devastating, but it's emotionally devastating, too.
That's why we're working so hard to find a cure or vaccine."
There is currently one commercial vaccine available, but in limited
amounts, she said. Some producers using the vaccine have been working
with Tokach and the K-State scientists, giving them the opportunity
to study the vaccine's effectiveness in the field.
It's too early to tell how effective this vaccine will be, but the
preliminary trials look good, Tokach said.
Scientists are also working to find a point of origin, such as a
particular farm or possibly maybe a boar stud, but have had little
success so far. The disease seems to be spreading rapidly and
randomly, making it difficult to predict where it may turn up next.
Some symptoms of PCVAD include anorexia, rapid weight loss, generally
unhealthy pigs, skin discoloration or lesions, respiratory problems
and diarrhea, according to a brochure from the National Pork Board
and the AASV. The brochure recommends some management practices
producers can follow to reduce the risk of a PCVAD outbreak and is
available on the World Wide Web at
<http://www.aasp.org/aasv/documents/PCVADBrochure.pdf>.
If producers suspect that their herds may be affected, Tokach
recommends that they work with their veterinarian to collect tissue
and blood samples to be tested.
