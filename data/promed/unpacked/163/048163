The State Ministry of Health has banned selling yellow fever cards by individuals at Juba International Airport unless those individuals are 1st vaccinated, according to a ministerial order from the state minister of health in Central Equatoria [one of the states of South Sudan].

The order states that yellow fever cards are only to be issued by the Central Equatoria Ministry of Health.

Radio Tamazuj reported on 3 Jul 2015 that individuals at Juba Airport were selling yellow fever cards to people who had not been vaccinated [reported by ProMED-mail in archive no. 20150704.3485325].

"I went to Ministry of Health to get vaccinated against yellow fever and get the card but I was told that they got finished but was referred to some persons at Juba International Airport where I got only the card and paid SSP 150 [about USD 49]," a traveler told Radio Tamazuj in July [2015].

[If the Ministry of Health is just now issuing the order to halt the sale of fake yellow fever (YF) vaccination cards, the delay is of serious concern. It was public knowledge that the practice was going on on 3 Jul 2015, some 16 weeks ago. As noted in that earlier posted comment, the sale of fake yellow fever vaccination cards or issuance of certificates to individuals who did not receive the vaccine presents a serious public health problem inside and outside South Sudan. Susceptible unvaccinated individuals could contribute to a YF outbreak within or outside the country.

YF outbreaks have occurred in Sudan, and South Sudan is also likely at risk. Yellow fever is not new to the Sudan. Between 3 Oct and 24 Nov 2013, a total of 44 confirmed cases of YF were reported, including 14 deaths. A total of 12 localities in West and South Kordofan were affected by that outbreak. There was a large YF outbreak in Sudan's Darfur state in 2012-2013. In 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that over 840 people were infected with yellow fever in Darfur and that the epidemic had affected 35 out of 64 localities in the region since September 2012.

Apparently, the earlier report was true -- employees of the Ministry of Health have been issuing YF vaccination cards without vaccinations. Issuance of fake YF vaccination cards, or cards without vaccination, carries potentially serious adverse consequences both within South Sudan and outside the country. An unvaccinated viremic individual with a card who becomes infected in a country such as Sudan, where YF virus outbreaks have occurred, could bring the virus to South Sudan. Conversely, an unvaccinated viremic individual with a card who becomes infected in South Sudan could carry YF virus to localities where vector mosquitoes are present and initiate an outbreak of this serious disease. Public health authorities and law enforcement agencies in South Sudan and any other countries where the certificates are being sold without vaccination should crack down on the practice swiftly and end it. It is also critical that YF vaccine be consistently available in government clinics at affordable cost so that there is no demand for the purchase of cards.
