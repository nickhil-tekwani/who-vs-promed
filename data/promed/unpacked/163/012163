Monkey dies of yellow fever in [Santa Catarina] and rekindles the alert for the disease in the state.

The case was confirmed by the Epidemiological Surveillance this Friday [10 Dec 2021]; vaccination coverage in the state is below that recommended by the Ministry of Health.

Dive/SC (Directorate of Epidemiological Surveillance of Santa Catarina) confirmed the death of a monkey as a result of the yellow fever virus in Pedras Grandes, in the south of the state. Howler monkey sample collection took place on [24 Nov 2021].

With this, the State has 625 cases of epizootics notified this year [2021] alone, of which 137 were confirmed with yellow fever.

In relation to human cases, there was a record of 8 cases of the disease, with 3 deaths. None of the human cases had a vaccine record against the disease.

The period of greatest transmission of yellow fever occurs between the months of December to May, due to favorable climatic and environmental conditions for the reproduction of the mosquito that transmits the disease.

"And once again, an alert is lit for the entire population and for the government. It is time to reinforce surveillance and disease prevention measures", declares João Augusto Brancher, director of dive/SC.

Monkeys do not transmit yellow fever. They live in the same environment as the mosquitoes that transmit the disease (_Haemagogus_ and _Sabethes_) and are therefore the 1st victims of the virus.

"When you find a dead or sick monkey, it is important to notify the health service so that the surveillance teams can travel to the site to collect a sample of the animal and carry out the diagnosis," warns Aysla Matsumoto, veterinarian at Dive/SC.

A vaccine is the best way to prevent yellow fever. All residents of Santa Catarina, from 9 months of age, must be vaccinated against the disease. The dose is available at health posts.

Until November 2021, vaccination coverage in the state was 79.57%, below the 95% recommended by the Ministry of Health, as it allows for the occurrence of more human cases.

"It is very important that people who have not yet received the vaccine, look for a health unit. Vaccination coverage is still below the recommended level, and with the circulation of the virus, unprotected people can contract the disease", highlights Arieli Schiessl Fialho, immunization manager at Dive/SC.

[The expansion of yellow fever that has been taking place in South America for the last few years raises concern for public health and also about potential conservation problems for susceptible non-human primate species in the continent. The virus is endemic in much of central and northern South America, and makes sporadic incursions to southern areas of the continent, like the states of Santa Catarina, Paraná, and Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, Misiones in Argentina, or Paraguay.

The yellow fever virus was introduced into the Americas approximately 400 years ago, yet the complex interactions that were established after its introduction are far from being elucidated. There is a need for more research on the eco-epidemiology of the disease in the continent, specifically on the role of each non-human primate species, and especially in the presence of the persistent anthropogenic global environmental change. - Mod.PMB
