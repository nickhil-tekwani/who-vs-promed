The Yamuna river is harbouring a high number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which can have serious ecological and public health implications, a recent study published in the latest issue of International Journal of BioAssays has revealed.

Strengthening the global concern that the development of resistance for antibiotics in bacteria will make the use of these antibiotics ineffective in humans, the study has reported that all the isolated [_Escherichia] coli_ strains in the Yamuna were found to be resistant to most of the tested antibiotics.

This may be explained by high and uncontrolled use of these antibiotics in humans and animals apart from pollution from pharmaceutical companies -- as well as heavy metals or biocides.

The study -- conducted by the University School of Environment Management, Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University -- also reported that a high incidence of multi antibiotic resistance (MAR) and multi drug resistance (MDR) has been detected in the collected samples from Yamuna. The study was done for commonly-used antibiotics like amikacin, ampicillin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and streptomycin.

"An ominous concern is extensive emergence of multiple drug resistance among microbes such as _E. coli_, which inhabit human intestine and readily contaminate drinking water sources like rivers due to faecal contamination. Results of antimicrobial susceptibility test showed that all the isolated _E. coli_ strains were resistant to most of the tested antibiotics," said the study.

Antibiotics are the biologically active compounds of natural or synthetic origin, which are widely used to prevent or treat [bacterial] infections in humans, animals and food producing insects [bees] and plants.

"The abuse of antibiotics in human medicines, animal treatment and agriculture, combined with inadequate wastewater treatment, has led to the presence of antibiotics and antibiotic resistant bacteria in the environment, particularly in surface waters. Subsequently, it has led to the development of multiple drug resistance in many bacterial species," the study said.

The microbiological safety of drinking water is generally assessed using microbial indicators called faecal coliform bacteria, and in particular _E. coli_, which is commonly found in the lower intestine of humans. It is also found in water, soil, and vegetation.

Commensal _E. coli_ in human gut can act as reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes which might be transferred to other commensal or pathogenic bacteria.

"The bacterial strains isolated from Yamuna have a high degree of resistance to most of the antibiotics. The increasing resistance and multiple resistances of the bacterial strains in this river could be attributed to discharge resultant from faecal residues, household activities and hospital wastes from the areas adjoining the river, which overflowed in Yamuna through surface run off and sewage outlets," it said.

Bhardwaj R, Gupta A, Garg JK: Prevalence of multidrug resistance in _Escherichia coli_ strains isolated from river Yamuna, Delhi stretch. International J Bioassays, 2015; 4(11): 4492-8; available at http://www.ijbio.com/index.php/ijb/article/view/828/pdf

Abstract
--------
"River water can act as a sink of multidrug resistant strains that may have serious public health implications. The aim of the study was to assess the antibiotic susceptibility and multidrug resistance character of twenty-eight _Escherichia coli_ strains that have been isolated from water samples collected from the River Yamuna in Delhi stretch, India. The isolates were subjected to antibiotic sensitivity test by Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method as per Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) guidelines using 24 different antibiotics belonging to three different modes of action namely beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, phenicols, tetracyclines, and quinolones. Most evident results of the study were that none of antibiotics used in the study was 100 percent effective. Findings have revealed that 100 percent of the isolates exhibited multi drug resistance (MDR) character and all the isolates were having a very high multiple antibiotic-resistance (MAR) index, suggesting the origin of the isolates to be of high antibiotic usage. Presence of multi drug resistant _E. coli_ in river water can act as a medium to spread antibiotic resistance to other bacteria. The current attempt towards identification of existence of multidrug resistant bacteria isolated from the river Yamuna is a rather timely event which may find utility in the development of strategies to counteract this problem by incorporating the use of antibiotic resistance as a bacteriological water quality parameter."

The Yamuna River is the longest (that is, 1376 kilometers or 855 mi) tributary of the Ganges, in northern India. Originating from the Yamunotri Glacier on the southwestern slopes of the Lower Himalayas in Uttarakhand, it drains over 40 percent of the entire Ganges Basin that includes the Indian states of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh, passing by Delhi, and merges with the Ganges at Triveni Sangam, Allahabad, the site for the Kumbha Mela, a mass pilgrimage in which Hindus gather to bathe in the sacred river every 12 years.

As the authors of the study point out: "The [Yamuna] river is a major source of potable water to Delhi, which unfortunately also receives, untreated and partially treated domestic, agricultural, and industrial wastes from the mega-metropolis city of Delhi." The river is also polluted by untreated sewage, wash-off of fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides from agricultural sites and run-off from commercial activity and industrial sites at multiple other points along its run (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamuna).

The following is extracted from my moderator comments in ProMED-mail post Antibiotic resistance - India (02) 20141205.3012828:

"The news report above paints a very grim picture of antibiotic overuse and its consequences in India. The news report says that antibiotic overuse in India is driven by private doctors who deliver about 90 percent of care and who are often poorly trained. Apparently, these physicians in India can prescribe as well as dispense antibiotics, profiting from their selling antibiotics for which they have written prescriptions. In addition, pharmacists dispense antibiotics over-the-counter in India, without a physician's prescription (http://www.reactgroup.org/news/332/18.html). Antibiotic overuse is also occurring in India's rapidly growing industrialized animal husbandry.

"Much of this antibiotic usage is for inappropriate indications, which needlessly causes intestinal bacteria exposed to antibiotics to become resistant. These resistant intestinal bacteria end up in human fecal waste that is then spread in the environment because half of Indians defecate outdoors and much of the sewage generated by those who do use toilets is untreated, contaminating surface water (creeks, lakes, and streams) and ground water to eventually end up in the drinking water.

"India is also a large producer of the world's supply of generic antibiotics, which has led to environmental contamination by these drugs. A study found high levels of antibiotics downstream from a waste-water treatment plant that received effluent water from 90 Indian drug production facilities near Hyderabad, India -- much higher levels than levels measured in waters that receive sewage effluent in the USA. In addition, high levels of antibiotics were found both in well water that was used for drinking by local villagers and in lakes that did not take in wastewater from the sewage plant, suggesting that drug contamination of surface, ground, and drinking water was more generalized (Fick J, Soederstroem H, Lindberg RH, et al: Contamination of surface, ground, and drinking water from pharmaceutical production. Environ Toxicol Chem. 2009; 28(12): 2522-7. doi: 10.1897/09-073.1; available at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1897/09-073.1/full).

"Antibiotic resistance is thus not restricted just to hospitals in India, but is circulating widely in the community, and its causes are not restricted just to overuse of antibiotics by physicians or pharmacists who dispense antibiotics without valid prescriptions. Its causes are complex and will require wide-ranging efforts to control." - Mod.ML
