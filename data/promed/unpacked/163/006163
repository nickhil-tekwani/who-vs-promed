The Japanese word for syphilis, "baidoku," literally translates as "plum poison." It was so named from the chancres (painless ulcerations) that appear on the skin in the disease's primary stage, which were thought to resemble plum blossoms.

Nikkan Gendai [27 Nov 2015] notes that according to the Shinjuku-based National Institute of Infectious Diseases, reported cases of this ancient scourge of mankind appear to be making a comeback. While 831 cases were reported in 2008, the number declined to 621 in 2010. By the end of October this year [2015], the count was up to 2037 -- up from 1670 for all of 2014. Most disconcerting, perhaps, is that the largest demographic turned out to be females in the 20 to 24 years age group: the 177 reported cases represented a 2.7-fold increase over the year before.

"We're in the midst of a worldwide pandemic," says Dr Yasuhiko Onue, an authority on sexually transmitted diseases. "Among the carriers I believe are also women from Asian countries visiting Japan." Koichiro Fujita, professor emeritus at Tokyo Medical and Dental University, tells the newspaper, "It's spreading because more people are engaging in sex without taking precautions. Young females lacking knowledge of the ways of the world are overly trusting, and are persuaded by males to have sex with them without use of a condom."

The decline in fears over contracting AIDS appears to be a main factor, says Fujita. "When HIV was a concern, warnings were ubiquitous, and young people became more conscientious about use of condoms," he explains. "But more recently there's been less concern over contracting HIV. And at the same time people regard syphilis as 'a disease of olden times,' and they're not taking the necessary precautions."

Another contributing factor, Dr Fujita believes, is the insufficiency of vitamin B, which may be responsible for weakening of the surface membrane of the genitals and lowered resistance to infection. Syphilis can also be spread via oral sex.

Unlike gonorrhea, syphilis in its early stages can be asymptomatic, and if a woman is infected during pregnancy, miscarriages or stillbirths are not uncommon. If the fetus does survive, should the syphilis bacteria infect its brain, mental impairment can result.

"It's very difficult to tell if a woman's been infected from a superficial glance," says Dr Fujita. "Some of them tend to have rather sickly complexions. During sex, some of them may have telltale wart-like bumps, or inflammation, on their genitals. "Some doctors overseas say they can detect infection from the characteristic odor. In any case, they should undergo a blood test as part of a full physical examination, and specifically request the doctor to look for signs of syphilis.

Tertiary cases of syphilis are a relative rarity but if allowed to go untreated a carrier can suffer a fatal aneurysm. Should you find yourself tested positive, Nikkan Gendai advises, you should also inform all of your recent sexual partners, whether they are amateurs or pros.

[ProMED-mail reported last year (2014) that the number of cases of syphilis, presumably primary and secondary syphilis, in Japan increased yearly since 2010, to reach more than 1000 cases in 2013; 989 of those infected were men, with the majority being between the ages of 25 and 39. The news report said that the Tokyo branch of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases speculated that that this increase is due to "sexual contact between males". This presumed increase in syphilis in Japan due to men who have sex with men (MSM) is similar to the situation in the US and many other countries, as reported in past ProMED-mail posts listed below.

In the US in 2012, primary and secondary syphilis cases in the 35 reporting areas that reported the sex of sex partners for 70 percent or more of male cases comprised 83.7 percent (13 113) of all nationwide cases. In those areas in 2012, the proportion of male primary and secondary syphilis cases attributed to MSM increased from 77 percent (6366) in 2009 to 83.9 percent (8701) (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6318a4.htm). Again in the US in 2014, 83 percent of primary and secondary syphilis cases occurred in MSM (http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-msm-syphilis.htm). This has been attributed to a variety of reasons that promote unprotected sex among MSM, such as engaging in sex only with partners perceived to have the same HIV status as one's own in an attempt to avoid using condoms (serosorting), taking pre-exposure (PrEP) or post-exposure HIV prophylaxis, use of psychoactive "party drugs", multiple anonymous sex partners, use of smartphone apps, such as Grindr and Tinder, that facilitate anonymous "hookups", etc. According to the founder of Grindr, Tokyo is Grindr's 4th largest city, after New York, Los Angeles, and London (http://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/jul/04/grindr-the-new-sexual-revolution).

According to the news report above the number of syphilis cases continued to increase to reach 1670 cases in 2014 and 2037 cases so far this year (2015). The news report above, though, focuses on the increase in syphilis in women so far this year (177 cases in 2015) from 66 cases in 2014. However, women represent only 4 percent of syphilis cases in 2014 and 8.7 percent in 2015. Over 90 percent of cases of syphilis are occurring in men, most likely in MSM as part of the widespread on-going epidemic of the primary and secondary syphilis in MSM. If some of the increasing numbers of MSM also have unprotected sex with wives and girlfriends, there may be a spillover that may lead to a rising incidence of syphilis in women and also congenital syphilis, as has happened in other localities. Confirmation will require knowing the sex of sex partners of syphilis cases.

Often, the chancre of primary syphilis may go unnoticed, as it is painless sore, especially if it is located in the vagina, or in the anus or mouth of women or men. Syphilis does not cause any body odor. However, the vaginal discharge in trichomoniasis, another sexually transmitted infection, often has a foul odor. There is no characteristic "sickly complexion" associated with syphilis in either women or men. - Mod.ML
