Influenza season ending in the WHO European Region
--------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
- This issue is based on data reported in week 17/2011 [25 Apr-1 May
2011] by 44 Member States in the WHO European Region.
- Consultation rates for influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute
respiratory infection (ARI) are now at pre-season levels in all
countries.
- Sentinel-hospital surveillance data for severe acute respiratory
infection (SARI) from 7 countries shows that SARI hospitalizations
have declined to levels observed at the beginning of the season.
- Less than 2 percent of sentinel specimens from patients with ILI or
ARI, and 2 percent of specimens from sentinel SARI patients tested
positive for influenza.

Current situation -- week 17/2011 [25 Apr-1 May 2011]
-----------------------------------------------------
During week 17/2011 [25 Apr-1 May 2011], all but one country
(Armenia) reported low influenza activity. ILI or ARI consultation
rates either continued to decline further or were at very low levels
in all of the 36 countries reporting clinical data this week. Among 39
countries reporting on the geographical spread of influenza, 37
reported no or sporadic activity. Armenia and Lithuania reported local
spread, and Georgia, regional activity. The impact of influenza on
health care systems was low in 20 and moderate in 2 of the 22
countries reporting on this indicator.

A total of 7 countries reported data from sentinel hospital-based
surveillance systems for SARI: Armenia, Kazakhstan, the Republic of
Moldova, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia, and Ukraine. SARI
hospitalizations have returned to pre-season levels in these countries
and, although influenza detections have been reported from sentinel
sites in recent weeks, the percentage of samples testing positive is
very low.

Further information on the sentinel SARI surveillance systems
represented in the EuroFlu bulletin can be found in the "Overview of
sentinel SARI systems in EuroFlu."
[http://www.euroflu.org/documents/EuroFlu_Overview_of_SARI_Surveillance_Systems.pdf].

Virological situation -- week 17/2011 [25 Apr-1 May 2011]
---------------------------------------------------------
Sentinel physicians collected 136 respiratory specimens, of which
only 2 (2 percent) were positive for influenza virus: 1 was pandemic
A(H1) and 1 was influenza B. One country, the Russian Federation,
tested 20 or more sentinel specimens, and influenza was detected in 2
percent of the samples. In addition, 70 non-sentinel specimens were
reported positive for influenza: 37 (53 percent) influenza B and 33
(47 percent) influenza A. Of the influenza A viruses, 25 were
subtyped: 21 (84 percent) as pandemic A(H1) and 4 (16 percent) as
A(H3).

Sentinel hospitals participating in SARI surveillance collected 41
respiratory specimens, of which 1 (2 percent) was positive for
influenza. Only the Russian Federation tested more than 10 sentinel
SARI specimens, finding 1 positive specimen, to yield a 3 percent
positivity in the country.

Cumulative virological update -- weeks 40/2010-17/2011 [4 Oct 2010-1
May 2011]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 83 369 influenza virus detections were reported during
this period, of which 59 075 (71 percent) were influenza A and 24 294
(29 percent) were influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 47 068 were
subtyped: 45 311 (96 percent) as pandemic A(H1) and 1757 (4 percent)
as influenza A(H3).

>From week 40/2010 to week 17/2011 [25 Apr-1 May 2011], 1540 out of
5622 sentinel SARI specimens (27 percent) tested positive for
influenza. Of these influenza viruses, 876 (57 percent) were influenza
A and 664 (43 percent) influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 696
were subtyped: 643 (92 percent) as pandemic A(H1) and 53 (8 percent)
as influenza A(H3).

Since week 40/2010, 5250 influenza viruses have been characterized
antigenically: 2622 were A(H1) pandemic A/California/7/2009
(H1N1)-like; 2255 were B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (B/Victoria/2/87
lineage); 197 were B/Florida/4/2006-like (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage);
174 were A(H3) A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)-like; and 2 were
B/Bangladesh/3333/2007-like (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage). Based on the
genetic characterization of 607 influenza viruses, 169 belonged to the
pandemic A/California/7/2009 A(H1N1) cluster; 10 belonged to the
pandemic A/Christchurch/16/2010 A(H1) cluster; 46 belonged to the
pandemic A/Hong Kong/2213/2010 A(H1) cluster; 142 belonged to the
recently emerged A/England/142/2010 subgroup characterized by S185T
substitution in the HA; 12 belonged to the A(H3) clade represented by
A/Perth/16/2009; 5 belonged to the A(H3) clade represented by
A/Victoria/208/2009; 29 belonged to the subgroup represented by A/Hong
Kong/2121/2010 in the A/Victoria/208/2009 A(H3) clade; 23 belonged to
the B/Bangladesh/3333/2007 clade (Yamagata lineage); and 171 to the
B/Brisbane/60/2008 clade (Victoria lineage).

Since week 40/2010, 9 countries (Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Italy,
the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, and the UK) had screened
3533 viruses for susceptibility to the neuraminidase inhibitors
oseltamivir and zanamivir. The UK analysed most of the viruses
screened (1672). Of the 3169 pandemic A(H1N1) 2009 viruses that were
tested, 3077 were sensitive to both inhibitors and 92 viruses (2.9
percent) carried the NA H275Y mutation. These 92 viruses were
resistant to oseltamivir but remained sensitive to zanamivir. 18
influenza A(H3N2) viruses were tested and found to be sensitive to
both inhibitors. All of the 346 influenza B viruses tested for
susceptibility to oseltamivir and the 340 tested for susceptibility to
zanamivir were found to be sensitive. All 197 pandemic influenza
A(H1N1) 2009 viruses and 10 A(H3N2) viruses that were screened for
susceptibility to adamantanes were found to be resistant.

Comment
-------
ILI and ARI consultation rates are low throughout the WHO European
Region. The great majority of countries is reporting no or sporadic
influenza activity and the percentage of sentinel ILI, ARI, and SARI
samples testing positive for influenza has declined to pre-season
levels.

[The EuroFlu website features an interactive map presenting
qualitative indicators of influenza activity (intensity, trend,
geographical spread, and impact) and the dominant virus as assessed by
each of the countries. This information can be accessed by clicking on
the individual countries in the map and readers are recommended to
make use of this facility. In addition, clicking on France, the
Russian Federation, Turkey, and UK (England) will provide regional
data for these countries.

The 2010/2011 winter influenza season in the European Region has
virtually ended. All but one (Armenia) of the 39 reporting countries
have reported no or low influenza activity. Among the 39 countries
reporting on the geographical spread of influenza, 37 reported no or
sporadic activity. Armenia and Lithuania reported local spread, and
Georgia, regional activity.

Consequently for the present ProMED-mail will discontinue reproducing
