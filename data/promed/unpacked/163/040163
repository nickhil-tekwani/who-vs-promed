VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Princess Cruise Lines canceled an Alaskan
voyage of the Regal Princess after viral outbreaks sickened hundreds of
passengers during three successive cruises.
Rick James, a vice president of Los Angeles-based Princess, was cited as
saying that at least 270 people suffered diarrhea and vomiting after
contracting the unknown virus during week-long cruises that began June 7,
14 and 21. Two investigators from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention boarded the ship in Juneau last week to determine the origin of
the outbreak.
Dave Forney, a senior health advisor for the CDC, was quoted as saying,
"We're dealing with a viral outbreak as far as we can tell. We don't know
if it's food-borne or water-borne, but we're looking at all these avenues
of exposure."
