The number of cases of hepatitis C has increased by more than a 3rd in 2 years. There were 7882 cases confirmed in England in 2010, rising to 10 873 in 2012. Experts estimate there are 160 000 living with hepatitis C, many unaware they are infected. The Public Health England figures, released ahead of World Hepatitis Day on Sunday [28 Jul 2013], show that hospital admissions for end stage liver disease and liver cancer caused by hepatitis C increased from 574 in 1998 to 2266 in 2012.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has called hepatitis a "silent epidemic" because so many people do not realise they are infected. Dr Helen Harris, a hepatitis expert at Public Health England, said: "While there has been an increase in confirmed cases of hepatitis C infection, partly as a result of increased testing and partly because of improved laboratory reporting, sadly, many people chronically infected with hepatitis C remain unaware of their infection."

For many, it can be several years or even decades before they develop symptoms. Antiviral therapies exist that will clear the virus in most cases, yet only around 3 percent of the chronically infected population in England access them each year. If the number of people being treated is doubled over the next 10 years, around 6000 new cases of hepatitis C-related end stage liver disease could be averted over the next 30 years.

Hepatitis C in the UK annual report
-----------------------------------
Laboratory-confirmed new diagnoses of hepatitis C infection (HCV) reported in England rose to 10 873 cases in 2012, up by more than one 3rd from the 7882 cases reported in 2010 -- when statutory notification by diagnostic laboratories was 1st introduced. London accounted for 26 per cent of all cases reported in England in 2012, almost treble -- at 2844 cases -- the 954 reported in London in 2010. These are among the conclusions of the annual hepatitis C report published by Public Health England (PHE) ahead of World Hepatitis Day on Sunday 28 Jul 2013 [1,2].

The report is the 8th for England, and the 5th also to present consolidated data for the UK as a whole. The main chapters describe: the scale of the UK problem; prevention; diagnosis, testing and awareness of infection; and treatment and care in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, respectively. Data are also presented on testing and diagnosis in respect of particular groups (people who inject drugs, prison populations, black and minority ethnic populations and blood donors).

Across the UK more than 215 000 individuals are thought to be chronically infected with hepatitis C. In England, around 160 000 people are living with chronic infection, the report confirms, many of whom are unaware of their infection. Over the past 15 years, hospital admissions for hepatitis C-related end stage liver disease and liver cancer in England have increased from 574 in 1998 to 2266 in 2012, while deaths have risen from 115 in 1998 to 326 in 2012.

Antiviral therapies exist that will clear the virus in most cases, yet only around 3 per cent of the chronically infected population in England access them each year. Preliminary results from statistical models presented in the report suggest that cases of hepatitis C-related, end-stage liver disease, and the number of liver cancer patients, could be substantially reduced by increasing access to treatment.

The greatest risk of hepatitis C infection is associated with sharing equipment for injecting drugs. Data from the Unlinked Anonymous Monitoring (UAM) survey of people who inject drugs suggest that levels of infection in this group remained high in 2012, with around half of those surveyed in England being infected [3].

PHE is encouraging local authorities and NHS colleagues to absorb the recommendations in this report and take local action to drive improvements in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis C infection.

[Hepatitis C is found worldwide, with some countries having chronic infection rates as high as 5 per cent and above. Hepatitis C virus is most commonly transmitted through exposure to infectious blood. This can occur through: receipt of contaminated blood transfusions, blood products and organ transplants; injections given with contaminated syringes and needlestick injuries in health care settings; injecting drug use; or being born to a hepatitis C infected mother. Hepatitis C may be transmitted through sex with an infected person or sharing personal items contaminated with infectious blood, but these are less common. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food or water, or by casual contact such as hugging, kissing and sharing food or drinks with an infected person.

According to the HPA report above, the number of cases of hepatitis C has increased by more than a 3rd in 2 years in England. There were 7882 cases confirmed in England in 2010, rising to 10 873 in 2012. The HPA estimates that around 160 000 people are living with chronic infection in England, many of whom are unaware of their infection. London accounted for 26 per cent of all cases reported in England in 2012, almost treble -- at 2844 cases -- the 954 reported in London in 2010. It is likely that there has been a corresponding increase in the prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection throughout the UK.

The greatest risk of hepatitis C infection is associated with sharing equipment for injecting drugs. Data from the Unlinked Anonymous Monitoring (UAM) survey of people who inject drugs suggest that levels of hepatitis C virus infection in this group remained high in 2012, with around half of those surveyed in England being infected. - Mod.CP
