The Pennsylvania Department of Health has added another 6 cases to the ongoing campylobacter outbreak linked to raw milk from Your Family Cow dairy in Chambersburg, PA, bringing the number of confirmed infections to 71. At least 9 individuals have been hospitalized. The current age range of those sickened is from 2 to 74 years old, with 24 of the victims (34 per cent) under the age of 18.

The latest breakdown of cases by state is as follows: Pennsylvania (62 illnesses), Maryland (4), West Virginia (3), New Jersey (2).

After making improvements to equipment and passing a health inspection, the dairy was cleared to resume production early last week.

The sale of unpasteurized milk is legal in Pennsylvania. Since 2007, the state has had at least 7 disease outbreaks linked to raw milk, resulting in 288 confirmed illnesses:

2007 - Salmonella (29 illnesses)
2007 - Campylobacter (7)
2008 - Campylobacter (72)
2008 - Campylobacter (68)
2009 - Campylobacter (9)
2010 - Campylobacter (22)
2012 - Campylobacter (71 thus far)

In that time, the state's department of health has tracked an additional 9 clusters of 5 or fewer illnesses that have been linked to raw milk.

The Pennsylvania Department of Health plans to update its outbreak information as new cases of infection are confirmed.

[The update does not state whether the additional cases had dates of illness onset after 1 Feb 2012, the latest date of onset reported, but does break down the ages of those affected. A full third of cases have occurred in minors fed the inherently unsafe product by their parents. - Mod.LL
