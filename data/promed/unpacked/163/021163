Rapid risk assessment: Human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, Egypt, 1st update
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A PDF of the document European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, Egypt -- first update. 13 Mar 2015. Stockholm: ECDC; 2015 is available online at the URL above for no cost.

It summarises the epidemiological, virological and environmental information about human infections with avian influenza A viruses of subtype A(H5N1) in Egypt; and assesses potential changes in the risk to public health in the EU/EEA and to EU/EEA citizens. The report includes: Disease background information (Human and avian surveillance of A(H5N1) in Egypt, Human and avian surveillance of A(H5N1) in Europe), Event background information (Human cases in the world, Human cases in Egypt, Situation of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A(H5N1) in birds, Situation of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) in birds in Egypt, A(H5N1) virus characteristics and circulating A(H9N2) in Egypt, Virus transmission and risk factors), ECDC threat assessment for the EU, Conclusions. The Abstract and Conclusions are posted below.

Abstract
--------
Human cases and fatalities due to influenza A(H5N1) virus continue to increase in Egypt, with cases from the country now accounting for the highest number of human cases reported worldwide.

Continuous increase of virus circulation in backyard poultry and exposure to infected poultry are most probably contributing to the increase in human cases. Whenever avian influenza viruses circulate in poultry, sporadic infections and small clusters of human cases are possible in people exposed to infected poultry or contaminated environments.

Although Egypt has reported an increased number of animal-to-human infections over the past few months, the influenza A(H5) viruses do not appear to transmit easily among people, and no sustained human-to-human transmission has been observed. As such, the risk of these viruses spreading in the community remains low.

Increased human infectivity of the circulating virus and the protection conferred by the poultry vaccines currently in use should be further investigated.

The current assessment remains that there is no risk for the general public in the EU. Travellers from the EU should avoid direct contact with poultry or poultry products when travelling to Egypt.

There is a low but ongoing and continuous risk of the virus being introduced and cases being imported into Europe and therefore both veterinary and public health authorities should maintain preparedness.

Conclusions
-----------
The recently reported increase in human cases of A(H5N1) infection during the winter months 2014-2015 may be due to an increase in the circulation of A(H5N1) among backyard poultry and exposure to infected poultry across Egypt. Identification of such sporadic cases or small clusters is not unexpected as avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses are known to be circulating among poultry within the country. Strict implementation of control measures to reduce and eliminate infection in poultry is essential for reducing the risk of zoonotic transmission and human cases. Enhanced human infectivity of the circulating virus and the protection conferred by the poultry vaccines currently in use should be further investigated. Surveillance in poultry as well as in humans needs to be strengthened and, ideally, coordinated. Intervention programmes to reduce virus circulation in the country should be reinforced.

Travellers visiting Egypt should avoid direct contact with poultry and birds or uncooked/untreated poultry products.

[The Editor and Senior Moderator of FluTrackers submitted a correction to the WHO report posted in ProMED-mail (Avian influenza, human (68): WHO case count, H5N1 20150311.3222415) and also cited in the ECDC report above (with a reference to the WHO report). He wrote [edited]: "The line list of H5N1 cases from the 2015 monthly WHO reports enumerates 82 H5N1 cases in 2015. There is a discrepancy in the WHO cumulative table for H5N1 case counts in Egypt in 2014 and 2015. In the table, the 2014 case count is short 6 cases (based on onset dates) while the 2015 count (through 3 March 2015) is over counted by 6 cases. A link to the list of the 82 cases from Egypt in 2015 is included in my [the Editor's] blog post -- http://novel-infectious-diseases.blogspot.com/2015/03/egypt-leads-world-in-number-of-human.html." In this blog post, he wrote [edited]: "In late December 2014, Egypt surpassed Indonesia in the number of reported A(H5N1) cases.[1] As of 3 Mar 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed a worldwide cumulative total of 784 human H5N1 cases, about 37 per cent or 292 of these cases have been reported from Egypt (Table 1 [in the blog post]). 82 of those cases from Egypt occurred in the 1st 2 months of 2015 [2]. In addition, media reports suggests that another 4 cases have occurred since late February [2015] in Egypt and may be included in future monthly updates by WHO [3].

"The recent WHO report from 3 Mar 2015 notes, 'The number of laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection in Egypt with onsets of illness in the months of December 2014, January and February 2015 are the highest numbers reported by any country in a single month.' To put these statistics in perspective, about 36 per cent of all H5N1 cases reported from Egypt have occurred in the last 3 months. The graph [in the blog post] shows the distribution of WHO confirmed cases by ISO week number in Egypt since December 2014.

"Based on onset dates, since December 2014, there have been 105 H5N1 cases reported from Egypt. According to WHO, at least 28 of these individuals have died. The fatality rate among this group is 27 percent to date, although only 17 of these cases have been reported in media reports to have recovered.

"Besides the 82 cases from Egypt since the beginning of 2015, only 1 other case of H5N1 has been confirmed by WHO in 2015, a 37-year-old woman from Suzhou, Jiangsu Province in the People's Republic of China. With 83 cases so far this year, the H5N1 case count for 2015 already exceeds the annual case count of H5N1 for the preceding 7 years [4]. [However, as posted in ProMED-mail (Avian influenza, human (70): China (SC) H5N1 20150313.3228528), the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) on 13 Mar 2015 received notification from the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of a 2nd human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) affecting a man aged 46 in Sichuan, China. - Mod.LK]

"While the spotlight is on human H5N1 infections in Egypt, the single case from Suzhou, China [and the 2nd case in Sichuan] is a reminder that the H5N1 influenza virus is endemic in many parts of the world and that human outbreaks of H5N1 in the size and the scope now occurring in Egypt could quickly develop elsewhere in the world."

To add to the confusion over numbers, Ahram Online (http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/125142/Egypt/Politics-/At-least--deaths-in-Egypt-from-bird-flu-in--Offici.aspx) reported 13 Mar 2015: "At least 33 deaths in Egypt from bird flu in 2015: Official.

"About 33 people have died from bird flu in Egpyt since the start of 2015, according to Egyptian officials.

"Around 263 cases of bird flu have been reported in 25 governorates since the beginning of this year [2015], Moussa Soliman, head of poultry at the General Authority for Veterinary Services announced on Friday [13 Mar 2015].

"The most recent deaths were in Cairo, and the Nile Delta governorates of Menoufiya, Fayoum and Kafr El-Sheikh, according to the Minister of Local and Administrative Development Adel Labib.

"The minister added that infections are most common in the Nile Delta governorate of Sharqiya." ... - more

This number, 263 total cases in 2015, likely refers to human plus avian cases. Clarification from anyone knowledgeable would be greatly appreciated.
