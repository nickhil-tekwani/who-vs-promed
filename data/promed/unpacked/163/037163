Vaccines Rushed To Meningitis Town
Extra supplies of meningitis vaccines and antibiotics were last night
drafted into a South Wales town where three people have died from the deadly
brain disease.
Health experts have warned that cases of the brain bug have reached a 50
year peak and there are fears the outbreak may yet claim more victims.
Thousands of worried parents from South Wales and the rest of the country
have besieged helplines.
A spokeswoman for the Meningitis Research Foundation said: 'Our helplines
have been going all night from very worried people. Figures show there are
peaks and troughs in notifications of meningococcal disease and at the
moment we are in a peak.'
In the first three weeks of this year there were 440 notifications of the
disease, compared with 255 in 1998 and 304 in 1997.
Youngsters in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Kent were also being treated
for the disease which has claimed at least 35 deaths this year [1999.
More than 1700 pupils and staff at two schools in Pontypridd [Wales, where
two women and a 15-year-old boy have died, were vaccinated against the
disease yesterday.
Health chiefs were deciding whether to extend the emergency immunisation
programme to other schools in the area following more cases of the bug.
