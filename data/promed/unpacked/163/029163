Equine influenza virus, horses, United Kingdom
----------------------------------------------
We would like to inform you that the diagnostic laboratory at the Animal Health Trust (AHT) in Newmarket, United Kingdom has today (24 Jul 2013) confirmed positive cases of equine influenza in Shropshire, UK. The diagnosis was made following positive qPCR [real-time polymerase chain reaction] assays performed on nasopharyngeal swab samples.

These positive cases follow recent diagnoses made in Northumberland, Hertfordshire and Northamptonshire, although no epidemiological link has so far been made between the different cases.

[The AHT's Equiflunet website includes useful information for horse owners and for veterinary surgeons. According to their data, during 2012 there were equine influenza outbreaks in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Dubai (UAE), France, Germany, Uruguay and the UK, including cases in vaccinated animals. Details of UK outbreaks during 2012 are provided at http://www.aht.org.uk/skins/Default/pdfs/outbreaks.pdf.

The following recommendations on equine influenza vaccine composition for 2013 have been issued earlier this year (2013) by OIE's Expert Surveillance Panel:

It is not necessary to include an H7N7 virus or an H3N8 virus of the Eurasian lineage in vaccines as these viruses have not been detected in the course of recent surveillance and are therefore presumed not to be circulating.

Vaccines for the international market should contain both clade 1 and clade 2 viruses of the Florida sublineage.
Clade 1 is represented by A/eq/South Africa/04/2003-like or A/eq/Ohio/2003-like viruses.
Clade 2 is represented by A/eq/Richmond/1/2007-like viruses.

A panel of viruses covering both clades is available from the OIE Reference Laboratories.

Manufacturers producing vaccines for a strictly national market are encouraged to liaise with reference laboratories. This will ensure utilisation of reference reagents in the selection of viruses for inclusion in vaccines that induce cross-reactive responses that are immunogenically relevant to the equine influenza viruses circulating nationally" (see at http://tinyurl.com/l2zhmt3). - Mod.AS
