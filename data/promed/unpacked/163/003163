This is the 1st time that HPAI H5N1 is officially reported in Honduras.

The event started on 18 Oct 2022. On 27 Dec 2022, the ICF (Institute for Forest Conservation and Development, Protected Areas and Wildlife) was notified of the presence of sick and dead _Pelecanus occidentalis_ on the beach of the municipality of La Ceiba, in the department of Atlántida. Samples were collected and sent to the national reference laboratory, IHIMV (Honduran Institute of Veterinary Medical Research). The results were positive for influenza A on 28 Dec 2022.

The samples were sent to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) where, on 3 Jan 2023, a diagnosis of highly pathogenic influenza A subtype H5N1 (Clade 2.3.4.4b - Lineage: Fully Eurasian) was confirmed.

Therefore, a focal area, containment area and surveillance area have been established. Pelican carcasses have been buried. Likewise, serological sampling has been conducted in areas of greatest risk of exposure of backyard poultry in both the containment and surveillance zones, a total of 432 samples have been collected and the results have been negative. To date, only wild birds are affected, specifically _Pelecanus occidentalis_.

Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Brown Pelican / - / 43 / 41 / 2 / 0 / 0

"With severe mortality rates, avian influenza can heavily impact the health of both poultry and wild birds. Often considered mainly as vectors of the disease, wild birds, including endangered species, are also victims. The consequences of AI on wildlife could potentially lead to a devastating effect on the biodiversity of our ecosystems.

In addition, avian influenza can also cross the species barrier and infect mammals, such as rats, mice, weasels, ferrets, pigs, cats, tigers, dogs and horses.

The transmission of avian influenza from birds to humans is usually sporadic and happens in a specific context. People who are in close and repeated contact with infected birds or heavily contaminated environments are at risk for acquiring avian influenza".
