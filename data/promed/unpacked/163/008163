--------------------------------------------------------
Viruses constitute a major cause of plant disease and have an estimated economic impact of over USD 30 billion annually. They constitute almost 50% of pathogens responsible for emerging and reemerging plant diseases worldwide. Virus disease outbreaks threaten cultivated plants not only by impairing their growth and vigor, thereby diminishing gross yields, but also by spoiling produce quality and thus decreasing marketable yields. Such crop losses occur globally. Virus diseases also threaten endangered wild plant populations growing in natural ecosystems.

Begomoviruses, tospoviruses, and potyviruses -- transmitted by whiteflies, thrips and aphids, respectively -- belong to the groups causing devastating diseases in tropical and subtropical food crops. When virus-infected, newly introduced crops grow next to native vegetation, new encounters between viruses and native plants may have serious consequences.

The most important dissemination pathways [for the viruses] include transcontinental trade involving the seed supply chain; vegetatively propagated material; and plant products that are virus infected or contaminated with soil containing virus particles, viruliferous nematode vectors, or virus-carrying vector resting spores.

SUMMARY POINTS:

- Because of agricultural globalization and climate change-driven influences, viruses and their vectors are expanding their bioclimatic envelopes, crossing national borders into new geographic regions, and triggering virus disease epidemics leading to devastating crop losses.

- Continued alterations in climate and other climate-triggered challenges modulate the pathogenic behavior of plant viruses, trigger outbreaks of known viruses and create opportunities for new ones to emerge.

- Rapidly changing cropping patterns and agricultural practices designed to increase agricultural productivity are contributing to increasingly frequent and widespread virus disease outbreaks that are proving more difficult to manage effectively.

- The remarkable diversity of plant viruses and their vectors, along with climate change driven events, greatly influence virus epidemics, making it impossible to implement "one-size-fits-all" control solutions; however, robust solutions that are economically, environmentally and socially sustainable can be delivered by IDM [integrated disease management] that combines different types of control measures thereby conferring additive/synergistic effects in mitigating losses.

- Research that provides a sound understanding of the epidemiology of the virus involved and the mode of action and effectiveness of each control measure is required before comprehensive IDM strategies can be designed for each individual pathosystem and situation.

- Advances in scientific understanding of virus pathosystems, rapid technological innovation, innovative communication strategies, and global scientific networks provide opportunities to build epidemiologic intelligence of virus threats. Optimizing the advantages [of] technology can be achieved only by integrating these innovations with knowledge and concepts about plant virus epidemiology and management generated in the past using conventional data collection procedures.

- A paradigm shift toward deploying integrated, smart, and eco-friendly strategies is required to advance virus disease management in diverse agricultural cropping systems.

[Molecular methods are needed for virus (and viroid) diagnosis. Similar symptoms may be due to different pathogens or other factors, as well as a combination of several of these. In addition, asymptomatic virus infections may occur, depending on virus strains, host varieties and/or environmental conditions. These factors make surveys for the presence of any virus difficult and increase potential biosecurity risks.

For disease managent of seed transmitted viruses (and viroids), use of certified clean seed is mandatory. Disease management of vector transmitted viruses is extremely difficult and may include vector control, removal of virus and vector reservoir hosts, phytosanitation to reduce inoculum (such as crop debris), use of clean planting material and resistant crop cultivars, if available.
