New MERS-CoV case reported in Qatar
-----------------------------------
A Qatari man, aged 69, has been infected with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the Supreme Council of Health (SCH) announced.

The patient, who also has a history of chronic illnesses, had fever for a few days. He developed sore throat and cough and was referred to Hamad General Hospital. Upon assessment and laboratory investigations, the patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and subsequently confirmed as a MERS-CoV case in the national reference laboratory.

He is currently in ICU in critical condition.

The Rapid Response Team of the SCH conducted an epidemiological investigation including listing all close contacts to the case and initiated screening. Health education about appropriate preventive measures was given to the contacts along with close follow-up for any symptoms.

The SCH has urged all community members to implement the recommended infection prevention and control measures.

As a general precaution, anyone visiting farms, markets, barns, or other places where animals are present should practise general hygiene measures, including regular hand washing before and after touching animals, and avoid contact with sick animals.

People with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‚ÄêCoV infection.

Therefore, these people should avoid contact with camels, drinking raw camel milk, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.
