The coffee wilt disease is spreading fast in Uganda, where it has
destroyed some two percent of the country's coffee plantations,
officials said Sunday [8 Nov 1998].
"The situation is bad. The disease is spreading fast, doubling every
two years," William Nagaga, corporation secretary for the Uganda
Coffee Development Authority (UCDA), told AFP in an interview.
The disease, also known as tracheomycosis, is said to have affected
two percent of an estimated 300 000 hectares (741 000 acres) planted
with Arabica coffee, Nagaga said. The fungal disease affects the
roots, causing the plants to wilt and die. It has no known cure.
Nagaga said that the UCDA will spend more than 330 000 dollars in
developing coffee varieties which are resistant to the disease.
Uganda, the world's fifth largest coffee producer, has so far this
year exported a total of 3 013 701 bags of coffee worth 274.7 million
dollars, compared to 4 237 114 bags worth 355.1 million dollars
realized the previous season.

[In reviewing the literature, there are numerous disease causal
agents which go by the same common name of coffee wilt. Can any of
our subscribers provide some background or additional information on
this problem, including the exact disease causal agent? - Mod PKA]
