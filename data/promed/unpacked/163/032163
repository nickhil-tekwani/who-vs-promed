European Union veterinary experts have voted to ease curbs on exports
of pork and beef from Britain imposed because of foot-and-mouth
disease (FMD), according to the European Commission.
The Standing Veterinary Committee voted on Wednesday in favor of a
European Commission proposal extending the area from where Britain is
allowed to export fresh pigmeat to all counties that have had no
outbreak of FMD or have remained free of the disease for more than 3
months.
The vets had earlier this month recommended allowing pigmeat to be
exported from some counties in eastern England and Wales, Scottish
counties, and islands such as the Shetlands which had never had the
disease. These areas will now also be allowed to export beef, the vets
decided on Wednesday.
The proposal still has to be adopted by the European Commission and
will enter into force as soon as it is adopted.
The situation in the British sheep and goat sector will be evaluated
at the next meeting of the Standing Veterinary Committee on 6 and 7
Nov 2001.
The highly infectious livestock virus reached epidemic proportions in
Britain earlier this year, hitting more than 2000 farms and leading to
the slaughter of nearly 4 million animals.
