Romania's Intelligence Service's Report On Bird-Flu Origin Inconclusive says PM
-----------------------------------------------
The report of Romania's Intelligence Service, or SRI, stating the bird-flu
in Romania's chicken farms allegedly originated in imports from Hungary and
Slovakia was inconclusive, said Premier Calin Popescu Tariceanu on Tuesday
[23 May 2006]. The director of Hungary's Veterinary Authority, Miklos Suth,
emphatically denied the allegations the bird flu virus originated from
chicken imports from Hungary or Slovakia, MTI news agency reports.
The Slovak company Liaharensky Podnik, alleged to have sold tens of
thousands of chicken, said it sold only a few hundred birds, more than 3
months ago, to Romania's Drakom Codlea, where the bird-flu virus outbreak
originated.
Romania's Verba Trans Brasov, which [according to the SRI report] sold tens
of thousands of bird-flu contaminated turkey chicks imported from Hungary
to other Romanian companies, said it actually bought chicken, not turkeys,
and did not sell them but still [has] them alive and well on the farm.
"We bought in January [2006] from Hungary's Aviagen a total of 41 860 young
chickens. They are 18 weeks old, and in 8 more weeks, they will start
producing eggs," MEDIAFAX [was told by] Vasile Citre, the owner of Verba
Trans chicken farm. Romania's minister of agriculture, Gheorghe Flutur,
told MEDIAFAX he asked SRI head Radu Timofte to declassify the bird flu report.
Romania's Veterinary Authority and Ministry of Agriculture are currently
investigating what triggered the bird-flu outbreak in 3 of Romania's
chicken farms [in] early May 2006. The 3 chicken plants in the central
Romania's Brasov County, 8 Transylvanian villages, and one town were
immediately quarantined.
These were the 1st cases of bird-flu outbreaks at chicken farms in Romania,
with previous cases detected on family farms only. In April 2006,
authorities had closed the last of the 53 outbreaks active in Romania since
the virus was 1st discovered in the Danube Delta last October 2005.
Hungary's Ministry of Agriculture Tuesday [23 May 2006] said it will
enforce precaution measures in Hungary, considering the bird flu status in
Romania is very serious, MTI reports.
Romanian authorities placed, on Tuesday [23 May 2006], 60 households in the
capital city's 4th district under 1st-degree quarantine, after laboratory
tests late Monday confirmed the presence of the deadly bird flu virus in
poultry in the area. Some 200 people from Bucharest District 2 were already
quarantined from Sunday [21 May 2006], when the virus was confirmed there.
Romania had so far confirmed 37 outbreaks of bird flu in 6 counties as well
as in 2 districts of the capital city Bucharest one month after authorities
had closed all previous virus outbreaks. There are currently around 28 more
suspected virus outbreaks.

Romanian PM says bird flu not imported from EU
-----------------------------------------------
Romanian Prime Minister Calin Tariceanu on Tuesday [23 May 2006] dismissed
media allegations that imports of live poultry from Hungary and Slovakia
have caused a series of recent bird flu outbreaks across the country.
Local media, quoting a leaked report by the country's secret service SRI,
reported chicken farms in Transylvania brought sick birds from the 2
European Union-member states.
"I heard about this speculation that imported chicken brought the virus
into Romania. That's not true. I can tell you that there is no proof that
imports from Hungary and Slovakia triggered the new outbreaks in Romania,"
Tariceanu told private television station Realitatea TV. "I saw the SRI
report."
In the latest outbreaks, the virus spread from one chicken farm in the
county of Brasov, some 170 km (106 miles) north of Bucharest, after it sold
live chickens to peasants without health or veterinary certificates, the
agriculture minister said.
The SRI decided to make public its report on Tuesday [23 May 2006]
following repeated media requests. The report does not say that bird flu
definitely came from abroad but says: "The SRI cannot exclude the
hypothesis that the outbreak might have been caused by imports of birds."
It noted that chicken farms in Brasov have imported domestic birds from
Hungary, Slovakia and the Netherlands since January 2006 with health and
veterinary certificates.
Romania has reported more than 40 bird flu outbreaks over the past 2 weeks,
mostly in Brasov, just a month after the strain was said to have been
eradicated in the Black Sea state.
Tariceanu said the country's sanitary-veterinary authority and the farm
ministry had launched an investigation to determine the cause of recent
bird flu outbreaks.
Last Wednesday [17 May 2006], prosecutors issued warrants for the arrest of
2 owners of the Brasov farms. Another 7 people were being investigated for
allegedly spreading the virus.
The European Union candidate has culled nearly half a million birds since
discovering the 1st bird flu case in the Danube delta, Europe's largest
wetlands, last October 2005.
It has not reported any cases in humans.
