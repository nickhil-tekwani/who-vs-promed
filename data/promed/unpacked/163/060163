A fresh outbreak of a killer dog disease has flared a few miles from the corgi-loving Queen's Sandringham estate in Norfolk, where several pets have died in recent years. Cases of seasonal canine illness, SCI, which hits dogs walked in woodland, have been reported to Haven Vets surgery in Great Yarmouth.

The outbreak has raised fears that a new epidemic is breaking out across Britain's woods, parks, and even gardens this autumn.

SCI usually strikes from September to November, when owners love to walk their dogs in the carpets of autumn leaves, and without prompt veterinary treatment it can prove fatal. It was first diagnosed at Sandringham in 2009, the vast Royal estate that allows the public to walk their dogs on well-defined paths through the woods.

Several dogs were reported to have died, and after another outbreak, the Queen's staff posted warning notices at Sandringham. The Queen is a well-known dog lover and at one point had 13 corgis.

Haven Vets in Great Yarmouth say they have already seen 2 cases so far this autumn [2020], prompting it to post a warning on its Facebook page and circulate posters.

The new alert was raised by [a woman] who walked her toy poodle in Fritton Woods, also known as Waveney Forest, on [Sun 20 Sep 2020]. By the early hours of [Tue 22 Sep 2020] morning [the dog] was shaking and suffering with vomiting and diarrhea, classic signs of SCI. [The woman] rushed her 2-year-old pet to the vets, where the dog was put on a drip and remains in hospital after being diagnosed with the mystery illness.

The surgery [Haven Vets] confirmed it has also seen another dog and that it was the 1st time in several years a case had been confirmed.

Symptoms usually appear within 24-72 hours of dogs walking in woodland in autumn, and can come on very quickly and include vomiting, diarrhea and lethargy.

After the disease was first identified at the estate and other nearby woodland areas in 2009, the Queen reportedly personally requested the Animal Health Trust veterinary charity to investigate [see comment].

[According to AHT earlier comments], the cause had not been pinpointed, but it was believed that bacteria, blue-green algae, or fungal spores are responsible. Harvest mites have been linked to the disease, but tests have not proved conclusive.

[An earlier seasonal canine illness (or 'SCI') event in the Sandringham estate affecting 3 dogs (a Bichon Frise, a Yorkshire terrier, and a Shih Tzu Kiki) was published by the media on 16 Sep 2020.

SCI was addressed several times by the Animal Health Trust (AHT) in The Veterinary Record (News & Reports) between 2010 and 2013 (for example https://veterinaryrecord.bmj.com/content/173/8/177.2). See also https://www.vets-now.com/pet-care-advice/seasonal-canine-illness/.

This syndrome was first reported in dogs visiting the Sandringham Estate "and other woodland areas" in September-October 2009. Cases recurred, and were addressed by ProMED-mail, during the 3 following autumn seasons: In 2010, 37 cases were reported, of which 6 died. In 2011, a total of 95 cases were eventually reported by the AHT in 5 'study sites', namely Clumber Park and parts of Sherwood Forest in Nottinghamshire, Rendlesham Forest in Suffolk and the Sandringham Estate and Thetford Forest in Norfolk. On 8 Dec 2012, the AHT reported 11 new cases in dogs during the previous 2 weeks within hours of being walked in woods on the said Queen's Estate, which was open to the public (ProMED post http://promedmail.org/post/20111208.3545). AHT informed that the cause had not been pinpointed, but it was believed bacteria, blue-green algae, or fungal spores were responsible. Infestation with harvest mites was suspected to affect dogs coming from distant locations. Signs in affected dogs included vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy. Notices were put up at Sandringham, warning dog owners.

Unfortunately, the Animal Health Trust (AHT) charity, which undertook, upon the Queen's request, investigations into SCI has been forced to close its doors and enter liquidation on 31 Jul 2020, reportedly following fundraising issues exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic (https://www.aht.org.uk/). AHT, founded in 1942, was a large national independent charity in the UK, employing over 200 scientists, vets, and support workers. Its objectives were to study and to cure diseases in companion animals (horses, dogs, and cats) and to advance the teaching and practice of veterinary art and science.

Another seasonal disease of dogs, reported every year from woodlands in England during the recent years, is CRGV (canine renal glomerular vasculopathy), also known as Alabama rot disease. This syndrome has been subject to continuing investigations and research while its etiology is not yet established. Differentiation between CRGV and SCI requires laboratory involvement. The major renal histopathological lesion reported in CRGV is thrombotic microangiopathy. The prognosis of CRGV is poor.

Results of investigations into the etiology of the current cases are anticipated with interest, in particular, exclusion of CRGV. - Mod.AS

According to the Animal Health Trust, which has led the way in research into SCI, the prognosis is good for dogs treated early and appropriately. In 2010, when SCI was first reported, 20% of the cases recorded died. 2 years later fewer than 2% died. Most dogs given intensive veterinary care recovered within 7 to 10 days. This appears to be rather intensive care, involving monitoring and intravenous fluids.

Clearly, acute attention to when your pet is 'not quite 'normal' is key to getting rapid treatment and hopefully survival. This disease can progress from extremely critical to fatal in a mere few hours.

The main cause still remains unknown, though, after comprehensive research, it is said this could be occurring due to harvest mites or tiny insects in and around the wooded areas. Not all dogs get affected by this disease, so it is believed the mites trigger the illness, which turns more severe with time. Therefore, it is always recommended to administer treatments protecting your dog from not only fleas and ticks but also mites and other insects. Broad-spectrum flea and tick products, kills and prevent flea and tick infestation, protect the dog from heartworms, as well as control mites.

The mites may indeed be the trigger. The mite may set off some 'allergic' type reaction in sensitive dogs producing the syndrome. The mechanism reminds me faintly of the human allergic reaction to cats. However, there is a food being produced which renders the enzyme in the cat unable to produce the allergen. I wonder if a similar approach could work to whatever enzyme/allergy is triggered by the mite when it is encountered by the dog?
