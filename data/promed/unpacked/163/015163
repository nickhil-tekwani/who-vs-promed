Brain disease in Greek goats
-----------------------------
12 Greek goats were found to be suffering from the brain-wasting disease
scrapie in the 1st half of 2004, EU figures that were made public yesterday
[18 Jan 2005] revealed.
The data, issued by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), show that 12
cases of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) were discovered in
Greece, 8 in Cyprus and 26 in France out of some 17 294 goats tested
throughout the EU in 2004 [Apparently, these figures refer to the 1st
semester of 2004. - Mod.AS]. The figures were made public by Left Coalition
Synaspismos MEP Dimitris Papadopoulos.
Meanwhile, tests are continuing in the case of a French goat slaughtered in
2002, which experts think may have developed BSE [See comment]. The EU bans
the use of milk and meat from herds affected by a TSE case.

[The results of tests in goats for TSE's, during the 1st semester of 2004,
are presented in table form, available at
<http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/food/biosafety/bse/goats_1st-semester-2004_en.pdf>.
The figures are arranged in 4 groups: "Eradication"; "Risk animals"
(mostly, animals found dead on farms; also some emergency slaughtered
animals and animals with clinical signs during ante-mortem inspection in
slaughterhouses); "Healthy animals" (Healthy animals subject to normal
slaughter) and "TSE suspects" (Animals reported as TSE clinical suspect).
Positive and pending cases have been reported in the following countries:
Greece: 12 positive, 0 pending. (All positives were TSE suspects). Spain: 0
positive, 2 pending (in "risk animals"). Portugal: 0 positive, 48 pending
(3 in "risk animals," 45 in "healthy animals"). Cyprus: 8 positive, 0
pending. (All the positives in "risk animals").
The total number of adult goats in EU's 25 member countries is about 9.5
million, compared with 66 million adult sheep. The leading goat breeding
countries are (millions of adult animals): Greece (3.9), Spain (2.33),
France (1.03), Italy (0.82), Portugal (0.39), Cyprus (0.3) and Netherlands
(0.2).
On 30 Nov 2004, EU's Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC)
was informed that a definitive interpretation of the French data on a goat
suspected of BSE could not be provided by the Community Reference
Laboratory (CRL) for TSEs (based in Weybridge, England) until further data
from mouse bioassays were available in about 2 months. Those results are
anticipated with great interest. - Mod.AS]
