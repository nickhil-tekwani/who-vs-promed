University of Minnesota plant pathologists told crop consultants
there's a new disease needing attention. Goss's bacterial leaf blight
and wilt was first discovered in Nebraska in 1969 and confirmed this
2009 season in Minnesota.

"We need to watch for this. We've detected it only in a few fields
near Morris and Hastings. It's likely in other locations but not yet
discovered. Yield losses up to 50 percent have been measured in
Nebraska. Wet weather with sand blasting and hail would be ideal
environments for this disease.

"Goss's is still very limited but increasing in other states as well,
especially Nebraska. At this stage, accessing hybrids with good
disease resistance scores, plus tillage that buries most of the plant
residue from infected fields is our suggested control."

[Goss's wilt and blight of maize is caused by the bacterium
_Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _nebraskensis_. It is a persistent
and economically serious disease of susceptible maize hybrids in the
USA and has been reported previously from Nebraska, Indiana, and Iowa
(ProMED-mail post 20080822.2612).

The bacterium can also affect some grasses, which may serve as
pathogen reservoirs. Symptoms include systemic wilting and/or leaf
lesions and blighting. Infection of leaves, stems, and roots occurs
primarily through wounds (mechanical, hail, or insect damage), and
plants are susceptible at all growth stages.

The pathogen is seed transmitted and overwinters on crop debris and
maize kernels. Disease management includes cultural practices to
minimise inoculum, crop rotation, and use of resistant crop varieties.
Subsp. _nebraskensis_ has so far not been reported outside the USA,
however other subspecies affecting different hosts are found
elsewhere, including _sepedonicus_ (potato ring rot) and
_michiganensis_ (bacterial canker of tomatoes), which cause severe
yield losses on their respective hosts.
