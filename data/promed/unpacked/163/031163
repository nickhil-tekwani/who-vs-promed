Officials say a small beef cattle herd has tested positive for bovine tuberculosis [TB] in Alcona County [Michigan].

The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development said Thursday [23 Jul 2015] the infection was confirmed after testing of the herd by the agency and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It's the 62nd cattle herd found to have the infectious bacterial disease in Michigan since 1998 and the 2nd this year [2015].

Bovine TB primarily affects cows but can be transmitted between wildlife and other mammals, including humans. The disease is widespread among wild deer in the area of the infested cattle farm. A meeting for beef and dairy cattle producers in Alcona County is scheduled for [6 Aug 2015] at the Barton City Veterans of Foreign Wars post.

[Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease of both animals and humans. It is caused by 3 specific types of bacteria that are part of the _Mycobacterium_ group: _M. bovis_, _M. avium_, and _M. tuberculosis_. Bovine TB, caused by _M. bovis_, can be transmitted from livestock to humans and other animals.

TB can be passed to a herd by infected cattle, cervids, swine, and humans. It is spread through the inhalation of TB bacteria aerosols, through feed or watering sites contaminated with saliva and other discharges, or by drinking raw, unpasteurized milk from infected animals. The risk of exposure is greatest in enclosed areas, such as barns with poor ventilation.

TB is difficult to diagnose with clinical signs alone. In the early stages of TB, clinical signs are not visible. In later stages, clinical signs may include: emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade fever, and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. Lymphnode enlargement may also be present.

There is also a nationwide surveillance program in slaughter plants. If lesions consistent with TB appear on a carcass, a sample is sent to APHIS [Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service] National Veterinary Services Laboratories [NVSL] for confirmation. The state officials will likely be tracing the movements of animals into and out of this herd in an effort to find the originating herd or herds.
