Anthrax kills wild chimpanzees in a tropical rain forest
-----------------------------------------------
"Infectious disease has joined habitat loss, and hunting, as threats to the
survival of the remaining wild populations of great apes. Nevertheless,
relatively little is known about the causative agents. [The authors]
investigated an unusually high number of sudden deaths observed over 9
months in 3 communities of wild chimpanzees [_Pan troglodytes_ verus] in
the Tai National Park, Ivory Coast. Here, [the authors] report combined
pathological, cytological and molecular investigations that identified
_Bacillus anthracis_ as the cause of death for at least 6 individuals. [2
others disappeared, and, are believed to have also died of anthrax.] We
show that anthrax can be found in wild, non-human primates living in a
tropical rain forest, a habitat not previously known to harbor _B.
anthracis_. Anthrax is an acute disease that infects ruminants, but other
mammals, including humans, can be infected through contacting, or inhaling,
high doses of spores, or, by consuming meat from infected animals.
Respiratory and gastrointestinal anthrax are characterized by rapid onset,
fever, septicemia and a high fatality rate without early antibiotic
treatment. Our results suggest that epidemic diseases represent substantial
threats to wild ape populations, and through bush meat consumption, also
pose a hazard to human health."

[The full paper is well worth reading. Briefly, sudden deaths and
disappearances were noted -- in October 2001 and February and June 2002 --
in 3 different communities of chimpanzees, North, Middle and South. The 6
recovered bodies were examined, and _B. anthracis_ recovered from them all.
MLVA analysis indicated that they all died of the same strain, but the
number of primers used is not given. From the references, it would have
been only 6. So, the probability is that the 6 isolates are identical, but
it is not certain. While chimpanzees are meat-eaters, it seems that they
prey exclusively on various monkey species and ignore antelopes. They raise
the possibility of contaminated water, but there had been no observed
die-off of other species. As they comment, there are many ponds and water
sources, and, the forest is dense. A 3rd possibility is that, through
forest clearances, cattle trucks from Mali and Burkino Faso now pass near
the park border, but, as yet, there is no evidence of anthrax introduction
in relation to this road. Anthrax does occur in the Ivory Coast, in fact
throughout West Africa, and, with the exception of Ghana, is largely
uncontrolled.
If I were to bet on how these animals became infected, I would 1st guess
contaminated water in a pond where an animal had died and had been
scavenged, and then ask if chimps have ever been seen to gnaw on bones.
Lastly, there is the possibility that they had been eating leaves, on which
blow-flies had deposited spores from feeding on an unseen dead anthrax
case. Having 3 separate outbreaks would indicate a background series of
anthrax events.
This is a 1st. But, anthrax has been seen in Southern Africa in baboons
(_Papio ursinus_) and vervets (_Cercopithecus aethiops_) (See MHJ & V. de
Vos, Rev.Sci.Tech.Off.int.Epiz, 2002, 21(2), 359-383). Obviously, it is not
the 1st, but the chimpanzees at Tai were being intensely observed. I very
much doubt that it presents any risks to the bush meat trade, however much
one may hope otherwise. - Mod.MHJ]
