About 5000 birds are being slaughtered after avian flu was confirmed
in turkeys on a Suffolk farm, government officials have announced.

The H5 strain was found in turkeys at Redgrave Park Farm near Diss.
All birds on the farm, which include ducks and geese, are to be
slaughtered.

A 3-km protection zone and a 10-km surveillance zone have been set up
[maps available at the above URL - Mod.AS].

Police officers have been seen at the entrance to the farm, and
vehicles are being sprayed with a jet hose.

A statement issued by the Department for Environment Food and Rural
Affairs said that preliminary tests showed the turkeys had the H5
strain of bird flu. It is not yet known whether it is a highly
pathogenic form of the disease.

All birds are being slaughtered at the premises, and Defra said it
was consulting on what further measures may be needed.

Inside the zones, bird movements will be restricted, and all birds
must be housed or isolated from contact with wild birds.

All poultry keepers on the British poultry register will be notified,
and EU officials have been informed.

National Farmers' Union president Peter Kendall said: "Obviously,
this is another huge blow to the farming industry, which is still
dealing with the effects of bluetongue and foot-and mouth."

The acting Chief Veterinary Officer, Fred Landeg, said that
laboratory results on what type of bird flu it was were expected "in
the next 24 hours."

He told BBC Radio 5Live that the disease was discovered on Sunday [11
Nov 2007] by a vet who noticed that there had been an increasing
number of deaths among turkeys in one of the 5 sheds on the farm.

Results on Monday [12 Nov 2007] morning showed that the flu was of
the H5 type, but more tests were needed to ascertain whether it is
the dangerous variant.

He said that the risk of bird flu spreading was increased during the
autumn months because of wild bird migration.

Mr Landeg confirmed that the affected birds were free-range, meaning
they had access to the outdoors and may have been at greater risk of
catching the disease.

A statement released on behalf of poultry producer Bernard Matthews
said the affected farm was not owned by the company, and none of the
firm's farms fell within the exclusion zone.

Earlier this year [2007], bird flu was discovered at a Bernard
Matthews turkey farm in Suffolk.

More than 160 000 birds were killed after an outbreak of the virulent
H5N1 strain of the disease on the farm in February 2007.

Defra has today [12 Nov 2007] confirmed avian influenza in turkeys on
a premises near Diss on the Norfolk/Suffolk border after preliminary
tests were positive for the H5 strain. The premises also contain
ducks and geese. All birds on the premises will be slaughtered.

Full confirmation of results, including whether or not this is H5N1
and whether the strain is high or low pathogenic will follow.

A 3-km protection zone and a 10-km surveillance zone are being
established around the infected premises. Inside these zones, bird
movements will be restricted, and all birds must be housed or
otherwise isolated from contact with wild birds. We are also urgently
considering, with ornithological and other experts, what wider
measures may be needed.

All poultry keepers on the GB Poultry Register will be notified, and
the EU Commission has been informed.

Notes to editors:

1. Avian Influenza is a disease of birds. While it can pass very
rarely and with difficulty to humans, this requires extremely close
contact with infected birds, particularly feces. Advice from the Food
Standards Agency remains that properly cooked poultry and poultry
products, including eggs, are safe to eat.

2. All avian influenzas (H1 to H16) can be low pathogenic, but only
H5 and H7 are known to become highly pathogenic.
