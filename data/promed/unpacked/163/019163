Agriculture Victoria [AgVic] announced there had been a spike in yellow dwarf virus (YDV) in cereal crops, while officials in other states are also closely monitoring the situation. These widespread viruses can cause yield losses of up to 80 per cent when plants are infected early in the growing season.

AgVic's Narelle Nancarrow said symptoms can take around 3 weeks to appear after infection, however many infected grasses are symptomless, meaning the disease can be wider spread than farmers realise. Another difficulty in identifying the disease is [that] the damage can present very similarly to nutrient deficiency.

YDV is spread by aphids. Last summer and autumn [2019], with good rain allowing a green bridge, was perfect for YDV carryover. Ms Nancarrow said controlling the green bridge was one of the best ways of lowering the YDV risk. Further into the season, she said, farmers could consider an insecticide if aphid loads were particularly high, but that had to be weighed up against potential insecticide resistance and the effects on beneficial insects.

[Barley yellow dwarf (BYD) disease occurs worldwide and affects a wide range of grass species (Gramineae) including cereal crops like barley, wheat, oats, rice, maize, triticale (wheat-rye hybrids), and rye. It is the most destructive of the virus diseases for wheat, but oats are particularly susceptible. Grain yields may be reduced severely. Symptoms include leaf discolouration from yellow to purple (depending on the host species), stunting, reduced tillering, and empty seed heads. Yield reduction is most severe if infection occurs at the seedling stage. Plants infected in autumn may not survive the winter or show severe symptoms when growth resumes. Diseased plants often occur in circular patches within a field, which are associated with colonisation by the aphid vectors.

BYD viruses have now been split into several species in the family Luteoviridae (mostly in the genus _Luteovirus_). They are differentiated by their ability to be transmitted by various aphid species (family Aphididae) and their virulence on a selected variety of oats. Some of the viruses are transmitted equally well by several aphids, whereas others can be transmitted by only one or 2 species. The bird cherry(-oat) aphid (_Rhopalosiphum padi_) and (English) grain (wheat) aphid (_Sitobion avenae_) are vectors of the severe _Barley yellow dwarf virus-PAV_ (type member of genus _Luteovirus_). Coinfections of several BYD viruses may occur in one plant, which can result in either more severe (synergistic) or milder (due to cross protection) symptoms, depending on the virus partners.

The viruses cannot be transmitted by seed, pollen, or mechanical means and cannot survive in stubble or in the soil. Volunteer cereal plants or grassy weeds may serve as pathogen reservoirs ("green bridge"). Disease management includes use of crop cultivars with reduced sensitivity to the viruses and control of the aphid vectors. To protect beneficial insects such as bees or other pollinators, some neonicotinoid insecticides have now been banned in a number of countries which, unfortunately, is leading to increased use of other agrochemicals also under debate for potential environmental implications.

In Australia, cereal yellow dwarf viruses are increasingly prevalent in southeastern areas. Recently, another BYD-associated virus, initially identified in South Korea in 2016 and tentatively named Barley virus G (with suggested genus _Polerovirus_), was reported for the first time in the country from Victoria (ProMED-mail post 20181126.6166030). So far, little is known about its epidemiology, potential aphid vectors, and impact on crop yields.
