Abalone virus outbreak
----------------------
The head of Tasmania's abalone industry has confirmed there has been
an outbreak of a potentially deadly abalone virus at a processing
factory in the south of the state.

The chief executive of the Tasmanian Abalone Council, Dean Lisson says
traces of the ganglioneuritis virus were found in abalone stored in a
tank at the factory last week [week of 24 Aug 2009]. They have now
been destroyed, the tanks disinfected, and the water stored for safe
disposal.

Mr Lisson says there are no traces of the virus in the wild, which
supports the view the virus is endemic to the fishery and only
surfaces when abalone get stressed.

He says that is good news because it makes it a management issue.
"That comes down to good tank management and good handling
management," he said.

Mr Lisson says he has talked to the state's chief vet and he does not
believe any fisheries will be forced to close.

[Ganglioneuritis is an interesting condition causing inflammation in
the nervous tissue, which swells. The result is curling of the abalone
foot and swelling of the mouth. Thus, the organism cannot eat and
looses its grip on the rocks it so depends on.

Abalone viral ganglioneuritis (AVG) is a highly virulent herpes-like
virus, undescribed in Australia before 2005, and still not well
characterized. The virus affects the nervous tissue of abalone and
rapidly causes death. The virus can be spread through direct contact,
through the water column without contact, and in mucus that infected
abalone produce before dying. The virus is thought to survive only a
short time when out of a moist environment.

AVG affects both blacklip and greenlip abalone and hybrids of these 2.

In June 2006, coastal waters off Port Fairy were declared a Control
Area under the Victorian Livestock Disease Control Act (1994), as the
disease is listed as notifiable. Fishing and diving activities in the
Control Area were restricted to minimize the risk of human activity
transferring the disease to unaffected abalone populations elsewhere
in the State.

Abalone shell, viscera (meat and gut) should not be
- shucked (taken from the shell) at sea,
- dumped into the sea,
- used as fishing bait.
