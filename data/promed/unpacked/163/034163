A 35-year-old Indonesian woman has died of bird flu, taking the
country's human death toll from the virus to 57, a Health Ministry
official said on Tuesday [28 Nov 2006].
The woman from West Java had been undergoing treatment in a Jakarta
hospital since early November.

[This report lacks essential details to allow its reliability to be
assessed. In particular there is no clinical information regarding
the condition of the patient prior to her death, nor whether she had
any contact with diseased poultry prior to her hospitalization. The
report states that if her death is confirmed as due to H5N1 avian
influenza, the human death toll in Indonesia would rise to 57.
Previously it was reported that the death of a 6-year-old child on 16
Nov 2006 was a consequence of avian influenza and this fatality was
considered to be the 57th human bird flu death in Indonesia (see
ProMED-mail post: Avian influenza, human (179) - Indonesia, susp.
20061117.3291).
If the 6-year-old child is excluded, however, the most recent
confirmed cases of avian influenza were contracted around 5 and 7 Nov
2006. It is possible that the female patient identified in the above
Reuters report is in fact the 35-year-old female who developed
symptoms on 7 Nov 2006 and was hospitalized on 10 Nov 2006 and
designated as a confirmed case by WHO (see: Avian influenza, human
(177): Indonesia, WHO 20061113.3256). However that woman was reported
to be from Banten province, not West Java. Clarification and further
information are awaited. - Mod.CP]
