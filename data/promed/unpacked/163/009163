Pakistan: Avian influenza situation - WHO Update
--------------------------------------------------------------
The 1st case of human infection with H5N1 avian influenza has been
confirmed in Pakistan. Laboratory tests conducted by the WHO H5
Reference Laboratory in Cairo, Egypt and WHO Collaborating Center for
Reference and Research on Influenza, in London, United Kingdom, have
confirmed the presence of avian influenza virus strain A(H5N1) in
samples collected from one case in an affected family. Additional
laboratory analysis, including gene sequencing, is ongoing.
At the request of the Pakistan government, a WHO team traveled to
Pakistan to participate with national authorities in the ongoing
investigations of several suspected cases of human H5N1 infections.
The following conclusions have been made accordingly:
- The preliminary risk assessment found no evidence of sustained or
community human to human transmission.
- All identified close contacts including the other members of the
affected family and involved health care workers remain asymptomatic
and have been removed from close medical observation.
The Ministry of Health in Pakistan has taken timely steps to
investigate and contain this event including case isolation, contact
tracing and monitoring, detailed epidemiological investigations,
increasing the availability of personal protective equipment,
dedicating hospital facilities for any new suspected cases, and other
infection control measures. In addition, agricultural authorities,
including the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock and FAO,
have been active technical partners for the effective control of this
limited outbreak.

[This report is the first confirmation by a WHO reference laboratory
of a case of H5N1 avian influenza virus infection in Pakistan.
Samples from one member in an affected family have tested H5N1
virus-positive. The particular member of the affected family is not
identified. Other members of the affected family and their contacts
remain asymptomatic and test results are not stated. More precise in
formation is awaited, but occurrence of human-to-human transmission
has been discounted. - Mod.CP]

Bird flu kills boy in Viet Nam
-----------------------------------
A 4-year-old boy in Viet Nam has died of bird flu, becoming the
country's 5th reported victim of the H5N1 viral strain this year, a
health ministry official said today. "He tested positive for H5N1
virus late last week," health ministry administrative office director
Tran Hung told AFP. "It is the 1st human case of H5N1 in about 4
months in Vietnam."
The child, from Moc Chau in the mountainous northern Son La province,
was admitted to a local hospital on 11 Dec 2007 with high fever and
pneumonia. He was transferred to a Hanoi children's hospital on 14
Dec 2007, where he died 2 days later, said Hung. "His relatives told
us he had eaten chicken meat and that some dead chickens had been
found around his family home recently," Hung told AFP.
A total of 5 people are confirmed to have died of the virus in Viet
Nam this year [2007], the previous victim in August [2007], and 47
since late 2003, when the virus 1st hit poultry flocks in the
Southeast Asian country.
The onset of cold and wet winter weather, especially in northern Viet
Nam, is favouring the spread of respiratory diseases including avian influenza.

Two Egyptians test positive for bird flu - ministry
----------------
Two Egyptians have tested positive for the deadly H5N1 bird flu
virus, a day after an Egyptian woman died of the disease, Egypt's
health ministry said on Thursday [27 Dec 2007].
"There are 2 cases today, one in Damietta and one in Menoufia...
Today lab results confirmed that they are infected with bird flu,"
Amr Kandeel, head of communicable disease control at the health
ministry, told Reuters.
The 2 new cases, both of whom are currently receiving treatment in
hospital, bring the total number of human bird flu cases in Egypt to
41, Kandeel added.
State news agency MENA said the Menoufia case was a 22-year-old, but
gave no details for the 2nd case.
On Wednesday, a 25-year-old [female] died of bird flu in Beni Suef
province, south of Cairo, on the same day she was diagnosed as being
infected with the highly pathogenic virus.
She was the 16th fatality from bird flu in Egypt.
The H5N1 virus which causes bird flu tends to lie dormant during the
summer and Egyptian officials had hoped that after 2 years of
outbreaks it would not re-occur this winter.
But John Jabbour, an official at the World Health Organisation, said
the new cases were not surprising.
"The agent is there... Since July [2007] we've had no human cases and
many things calmed down, so people returned to dealing with live
birds as usual. Since the virus is there, we expect to have human
cases. It's not a surprise at all," Jabbour said.
MENA reported Thursday [27 Dec 2007] that veterinary authorities in
Sharkia province had culled 12 000 chickens after tests found the
flock had been infected with bird flu.
Most of those who have fallen ill in Egypt were reported to have had
contact with sick or dead household birds, primarily in northern
Egypt where the weather is cooler than in the south.
The government still finds it hard to enforce restrictions on the
movement and sale of live poultry.
The death toll is the highest for any country outside Asia and could
reflect the high population density in agricultural parts of Egypt.
Experts fear the bird flu virus might mutate or combine with the
highly contagious seasonal influenza virus and spark a deadly
pandemic which could circle the globe and kill millions.
Around 5 million households in Egypt depend on poultry as a main
source of food and income and the government has said this makes it
unlikely the disease can be eradicated.
