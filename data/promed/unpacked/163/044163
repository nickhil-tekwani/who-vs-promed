Poliomyelitis in Indonesia - update 7 - 1 Jul 2005
-----------------------
On 30 Jun 2005, one new polio case was confirmed in Indonesia,
bringing the total number of cases to 66. The new case is the 1st
from Lampung Province on the island of Sumatra. The 3-year-old girl
had onset of paralysis on 4 Jun 2005.

Both this case and a previous case from Central Java are from outside
the area where an emergency 'mop-up' campaign was held from 31 May to
2 Jun [2005], covering the provinces of West Java, Banten and
Jakarta, to reach 6.4 million children under the age of 5 years. A
2nd round of vaccinations was completed on 29 Jun 2005.

A large outbreak response immunization targeting 78 000 children aged
less than 5 years was held from 26 June around the case in Central
Java. Lampung and Central Java will be included in the next phase of
the large-scale immunization campaigns which will start from August.

[The identification of a case of polio in Lampung Province on the
island of Sumatra is disappointing news. All prior cases had been in
Provinces on the island of Java. Geographically, Lampung Province is
the closest to the island of Java, near Banten and Jakarta Provinces.
The island of Java is the most populated island in the Indonesian
archipelago. Provincial population statistics for 2000 from the
Bureau of Population Statistics of Indonesia, the estimated
population of West Java (Jawa Barat) was 35 729 537, Jakarta was 8
389 443, Central Java 31 228 940, Banten 8 098 780, and Lampung was 6
741 439 -- these 5 provinces represent approximately 44 percent of
the population of the country.

Provincial-level mop-up activities in the originally affected
provinces has not prevented spread to additional provinces. One
wonders at what point there will be the re-institution of national
immunization days as part of the response to this outbreak.

Further information from the Polio eradication website update on this
outbreak mentions that "genetic analysis of the virus demonstrates
that its origin is in West Africa, similar to the viruses which
caused the 2003/04 outbreak. Further analysis suggests the virus
traveled to Indonesia through Sudan, and is similar to recently
isolated viruses in Saudi Arabia and Yemen."

Hence, it appears as though the geographic spread from the original
outbreak in Nigeria (see references below) is continuing. - Mod.MPP]
