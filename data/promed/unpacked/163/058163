A horse that had gone down in its stall had to be euthanized Monday morning [26 Nov 2012] at Hawthorne Race Course, raising concerns that the equine herpesvirus that has been circulating at the Chicago-area track since 14 Oct 2012 remains active in the equine population.

A sample from the horse, housed in Barn 1 and trained by Eduardo "Lalo" Rodriguez, was drawn before it was euthanized and was sent for laboratory testing, according to state-employed veterinarian Dr Dawn Folker-Calderon. Until the results are obtained -- Wednesday [28 Nov 22] at the earliest -- there's no confirmation that the horse was suffering from the herpesvirus, known as EHV-1.

The virus has led to the death of 3 horses at Hawthorne, most recently on 18 Nov 2012, when a neurologically afflicted horse trained by Dale Bennett fell and had to be euthanized while being transferred from Bennett's barn to an isolation barn for horses showing sign of the EHV-1 virus or testing positive for it.

Another horse, trained by Mark Cristal, was transferred to the isolation barn, K-2, after testing positive for the virus late last week [week of 19 Nov 2012]. That horse, however, displayed no neurological signs of the disease, Folker-Calderon said.

Hawthorne has been under an Illinois Department of Agriculture-imposed quarantine since 26 Oct 2012 when the virus jumped from Barn A, the 1st place horses were infected, to Barn C. If the Rodriguez horse is confirmed positive, it would be the 1st afflicted horse from Barn 1. A positive test on that horse would also re-start the clock on the Hawthorne quarantine, which will last for 28 days after the last neurologically symptomatic horse is reported. The last such horse to test positive for the virus showed clinical signs 19 Nov 2012.

The Hawthorne quarantine was to a degree lifted last week, when the Department of Agriculture released protocols under which horses could leave Hawthorne for out-of-state quarantine sites. Horses trained by Gary Scherer departed Hawthorne on Friday [23 Nov 2012] bound for a private facility in Kentucky. On Tuesday morning [27 Nov 2012], 10 horses trained by Christine Janks left Hawthorne bound for Janks's farm in Florida, where they'll be quarantined. 2 horses trained be Leo Rodriguez were scheduled to leave later Tuesday for a quarantine site in Indiana.

Hawthorne-based horses, however, will not be permitted to leave Hawthorne for another racetrack, training center, or any other location housing an equine population until the quarantine is fully lifted.

All officials at the track are desperately hoping this horse does not have the disease that could reinstate the quarantine. Horse owners are also hoping for a positive outcome.

This is a very nasty and often fatal disease in horses. Usually the disease is abbreviated as EHV for equine herpes virus or EHM for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy.

Equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) infection in horses can cause respiratory and neurological disease, abortion in mares, and neonatal foal death. The neurological form of the disease is known as equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM) and has the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality.

EHV-1 is easily spread and typically has an incubation period between 2-10 days. Respiratory shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7-10 days but may persist longer in infected horses. For this reason, the isolation period recommendation for confirmed positive EHM cases is 21 days. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include nasal discharge, incoordination, hindquarter weakness, recumbency, lethargy, urine dribbling, and diminished tail tone. The prognosis for EHM positive horses depends on the severity of signs and the period of recumbency. Employing supportive treatment with intravenous fluids, anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-viral drugs, and other supportive measures may be beneficial, since there is no specific treatment for EHM.

Currently, no EHV-1 equine vaccine has a label claim for protection against the neurological strain of the virus.
