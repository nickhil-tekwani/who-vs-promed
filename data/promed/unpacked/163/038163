[1] Italy (Milan, Turin): waste water monitoring
Date: Thu 18 Jun 2020

English media report: The Local https://www.thelocal.it/20200619/coronavirus-was-already-in-italy-by-december-waste-water-study-shows


The Italian Higher Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanita; ISS) reports that sewage water from Milan and Turin already contained COVID viral RNA sequences on 18 Dec 2019 [over 2 weeks before China reported its 1st cases and 6 weeks before the 1st Italian cases were detected on 31 Jan 2020. - PNP].

A total of 40 wastewater samples were collected from October 2019 to February 2020, and [compared with] 24 control samples whose sampling date (September 2018 to June 2019) enabled the presence of the virus to be excluded with confidence. The results, confirmed in 2 different laboratories with 2 different methods, showed the presence of SARS-Cov-2 RNA in the samples taken in Milan and Turin on 18 Dec 2019 and in Bologna on 29 Jan 2020. In the same cities, positive samples were also found in the following months of January and February 2020, while the samples of October and November 2019, as well as all the control samples, gave negative results.

These results are consistent with previous reports obtained from the retrospective analysis on samples of hospitalized patients in France, which identified a SARS-CoV-2 positive in a respiratory sample in a clinical case dating back to the end of December 2019, and to a recent Spanish work that found SARS-CoV-2 RNA in waste water samples collected in mid-January [2020] in Barcelona, about 40 days before the notification of the 1st autochthonous case.

The ISS results confirm the "strategic importance" of sewage water as an early detection tool because it can signal the virus's presence before cases are clinically confirmed. The ISS plans to launch a pilot study in July [2020] in the main tourist resorts and set up a nationwide surveillance system by the autumn.

[Thanks to Pablo Nart for flagging this study and providing other references to back this up. The information presented is very interesting, and while other studies have cited a 5% stool recovery of the SARS-CoV-2, it seems as though waste water monitoring may well be another good strategy to serve as an early alert of the presence of the virus (and infections in individuals) in a geographic area covered by the monitoring plant. One suspects that there may be intermittent shedding of the virus in stool, so single captures may have "false negative" results, but monitoring the collective waste waters in an area seems to be worthwhile. Pablo has provided background articles, including the environmental sampling routinely done for poliovirus monitoring as part of the polio eradication efforts. Positive environmental samples in geographic areas signal where teams need to go to canvas the population looking for AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) cases and flag areas that need supplemental vaccination campaigns/activities.

Looking at the 2 links for waste watering monitoring in Spain, the monitoring in Valencia has shown the amount of viral RNA detected is now approaching zero in the area. In February 2020 no virus was detected; in March and April 2020, concentrations of viral RNA were high; and in May 2020, they started decreasing and are now approaching a zero point throughout Valencia. Waste water sampling (now at 950 specimens) has demonstrated identifying the presence of virus 1 week before cases were actually detected. The Galicia report mentions they will implement the waste water monitoring in time to monitor for a possible reintroduction in autumn and to serve as an early warning system of the virus reappearing in Galicia.

[2] Germany: meat slaughterhouse outbreak
Date: Fri 19 Jun 2020 15:27 EDT
Source: The Daily Mail [edited]

Germany has reported its highest daily increase in coronavirus cases in a month after managing to contain its outbreak better than comparable large European nations. The Robert Koch Institute, Germany's disease control centre, listed 770 new confirmed cases, taking the country's total to 188 534.

A flurry of positive tests this week from an outbreak at a slaughterhouse in the western region of Guetersloh contributed the biggest daily increase since 20 May 2020. Over 657 German slaughterhouse workers have been infected with coronavirus at a single meatpacking plant in the west of the country, officials announced today [19 Jun 2020]. The spike in coronavirus cases today marks a significant rise for Germany, which has recorded nationwide infections in the low hundreds lately.

Health officials in Guetersloh said they have received a total of 983 test results from workers at the Toennies slaughterhouse in Rheda-Wiedenbrueck. Of those, 326 tests were negative. All 6400 employees of the plant and their close contacts are now in quarantine after the plant was closed just hours after the news at 2 pm on Wednesday [17 Jun 2020].

Since the start of the outbreak, Germany has recorded 188 474 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 8844 deaths. The infection rate declined sharply after authorities imposed nationwide social distancing rules in March [2020], and the daily case increase had averaged between 300 and 400 in June [2020].

News of the outbreak in Guetersloh came as Chancellor Angela Merkel was meeting with Germany's 16 state governors to discuss progress in tackling the pandemic. Merkel said that the country would continue to try to relax restrictions while containing any local outbreaks. She said: "We are far away from an exponential increase. That's why I very much welcome that, as today in the county of Guetersloh for example, when there is such an accumulation of infections, then measures are immediately taken, for example the closure of schools and such-like. We see from these outbreaks that the virus isn't gone," she added.

Company officials at Toennies said the outbreak at the slaughterhouse may have been linked to workers taking the opportunity to visit their families in eastern European countries as border controls were relaxed. Officials ordered the closure of the slaughterhouse, as well as isolation and tests for everyone else who had worked at the Toennies site -- putting about 7000 people under quarantine.

The infections pushed the county above the threshold of 50 new infections per 100 000 residents over a week at which local authorities in Germany have to consider new restrictions. Officials decided to close schools and child care centers across the county from Thursday [18 Jun 2020] until the summer vacation starts near the end of the month [June 2020], but chose to avoid a wider-ranging lockdown.

There have been several outbreaks at German slaughterhouses in recent weeks, prompting the government to impose stricter safety rules for the industry and ban the practice of using sub-contractors. The outbreak in Rheda-Wiedenbrueck, where Toennies operates one of Germany's biggest slaughterhouses, could affect the meat supply in Germany. Sven-Georg Adenauer, head of the regional administration, said one-fifth of Germany's meat products could be unavailable while the plant is shut, the dpa news agency reported. [Deutsche Presse-Agentur GmbH (dpa) is a German news agency founded in 1949.]

Gereon Schulze Althoff, the Toennies official in charge of the company's pandemic response, said that the company had been "fighting like lions since February [2020]...to keep the virus out of the operation." Schulze Althoff said he had no conclusive explanation for why the infections had occurred now. But he noted that many foreign workers had wanted to go and see their families as European borders started to reopen, meaning that "we were exposed to new risks. We were aware of that, but we...carried out extra testing of people returning from holidays and so on," he added. "But we didn't succeed in keeping out these sources or this source (of infection) -- we don't know which exactly." He said the company has a lot of workers from eastern European countries, and many went home over recent long weekends. He said cooled rooms may also have facilitated the virus spreading.

Germany started loosening its coronavirus restrictions in late April [2020] and has largely kept infection rates low, though local outbreaks linked to slaughterhouses, church services and a restaurant among other places have caused some concern.

This week, the German government launched its coronavirus tracing app, designed to help people learn if they've been in close proximity to someone who later tests positive. Officials said the app was downloaded more than 6 million times in the first 24 hours. Merkel declined to say whether she was using the new app, saying only that she was "willing" to do so.

[Information from the Robert Koch Institute's (RKI) daily COVID-19 update adds to the above media report: "The increase in the 7-day incidence in the district Guetersloh is due to an outbreak in a meat processing plant. Several hundred employees tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Contact tracing is ensured at the present time. The affected plant was temporarily closed at short notice and all employees are being quarantined. In addition, all schools and day-care centres in the district will be closed from 18 Jun 2020 until the end of the summer holidays (11 Aug 2020). The outbreak in Guetersloh is linked to an outbreak in Warendorf LK. Employees of the meat processing company are residents of neighbouring districts." (see https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Situationsberichte/2020-06-19-en.pdf?__blob=publicationFile for full update in English).

Outbreaks in meat slaughterhouses have been reported, notably in the USA and in Brazil, and have been attributed to the close proximity workers keep in these slaughterhouses and the difficulties in working for long periods while masked. From the above report, the possibility of importation of the virus from outside of Germany is raised, but there has been virus identified within Germany that could have also been a point of introduction into the factory. According to the RKI daily report (URL listed in previous paragraph), North Rhine-Westphalia has reported a cumulative case count as of 19 Jun 2020 of 40 156 cases, the 2nd highest in the country, and 1660 deaths, with 379 cases reported in the last 24 hours and 1069 cases in the last 7 days.

The Guetersloh District, where the outbreak is located, is in North Rhine-Westphalia, in the western part of Germany. A map showing administrative divisions of Germany can be seen at https://www.mapsofworld.com/germany/germany-political-map.html. - Mod.MPP]

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 19 Jun 2020.

Highlights
----------
- The hydroxychloroquine arm of the Solidarity Trial, which seeks to find an effective COVID-19 treatment, is being stopped. The decision is based on evidence from the Solidarity Trial, the UK's Recovery trial and a Cochrane review of other evidence on hydroxychloroquine. Data show that hydroxychloroquine does not result in the reduction of mortality of hospitalised COVID-19 patients, when compared with standard of care.

- Dr Tedros announced the roll out of the WHO Academy, a major new initiative as part of WHO's transformation. With the WHO Academy, WHO aims to build one of the world's largest and most innovative digital learning platforms to enhance the competencies of health professionals. So far, courses on the OpenWHO.org have received almost 3.5 million enrolments on 12 topics in 31 languages.

- Several countries affected by COVID-19 have seen increases in levels of violence occurring in the home, including violence against children, intimate partner violence and violence against older people. A new brief, addressing violence against children, women and older people during the COVID-19 pandemic, outlines key actions that the health sector can undertake to prevent or mitigate interpersonal violence.

- Today's "Subject in Focus" provides a summary of virtual meetings held on COVID-19 preparedness and response at points of entry from the WHO Regional Office for Africa.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
-----------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 54.2% of the global newly reported cases and 68.5% of newly reported fatalities for this 24-hour period. Brazil reported 41.7% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, USA reported 30.0%, Mexico 6.4%, Chile 5.8%, and Peru 4.9%. The same 5 countries remained at the top with Mexico switching order with Chile.

The European region reported 13.4% of the global newly reported cases and 11.6% of the newly confirmed deaths in the region. Russia reported 41.9% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Sweden 7.8%, Turkey 6.9%, the UK 6.4%, Ukraine 4.8%, and Belarus and Armenia at 3.3% each. Again, same countries, minor juggling of orders and percentages on a daily basis.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 13.4% of the global newly reported cases and 9.0% of global newly reported fatalities. Pakistan reported 25.8% of the regional newly reported cases followed by Saudi Arabia 24.8%, Iran 13.6%, Iraq 7.6%, Qatar 6.6%, Egypt 6.4%, and Oman 3.9%. Same countries, minor juggling of positions.

The African region reported 4.7% of the global newly reported cases and 2.2% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 52.4% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria 11.2%, Cote d'Ivoire 5.7%, Ghana 5.1%, Kenya 3.2%, Congo DR 2.8%, Guinea 2.6%, Ethiopia 2.9%, and Mauritania 2.5%. While South Africa and Nigeria are consistently number 1 and number 2 in terms of 24-hour increase in cases, other countries have less consistent reporting patterns and vary considerably from day to day.

The Western Pacific region reported 0.72% of the global newly reported cases and 0.16% of global fatalities. The Philippines reported 54.6% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Singapore 25.0%, Japan 7.0%, South Korea 4.8%, and China 3.6%. The outbreak associated with the Beijing Seafood markets continues to bring China to prominence in terms of daily newly confirmed cases. That said, the Philippines and Singapore are consistently number 1 and number 2, respectively, and the other countries vary in daily reporting, including Malaysia and Australia.

The South East Asia region reported 13.7% of the global newly reported cases and 8.5% of global fatalities. India reported 69.8% of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 19.5%, Indonesia 6.8%, and Nepal 3.4%. Same countries, same order as in previous days.

Impression: Europe seems to be stabilizing at a significantly lower rate, although Russia is still reporting 7000+ new cases a day (down from 8000+ per day). The Eastern Mediterranean is on par with the European region, with Pakistan reporting 4000+ cases a day and Saudi Arabia reporting 4000+ cases a day. South East Asia surpassed both the European and Eastern Mediterranean regions, with India reporting 8000-10 000+ cases a day. The Americas region is reporting around 70 000 cases a day, with Brazil usually reporting 25 000-30 000+ cases a day and the USA at 20 000-25 000+ a day. In the Africa region, the regional proportion is slowly climbing, with South Africa reporting in the 3000-4000+ range daily, and in the Western Pacific region, they are maintaining a very low rate compared with the other regions, with the Philippines averaging 400+ cases per day (Singapore had been reporting twice as many cases per day for a period of time but has dropped back over the past couple of weeks).

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 19 Jun 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has significantly decreased. The Americas region continues to increase, as does South East Asia, which surpassed the Eastern Mediterranean and European regions today in terms of daily newly confirmed cases; the African region is noticeably increasing as well. The Americas region continues to greatly outnumber all other regions for daily reporting. - Mod.MPP]

[*On 2 Jun 2020, France completed a review of all positive lab tests reported and removed all duplicate tests on individuals who were counted more than once. This led to a decrease in cumulative case counts.
In the table above, NA is "not applicable"; those countries whose 1st case was reported after 1 Mar 2020 did not have cases on 1 Mar 2020. - Mod.MPP]

Countries with more than 5000 cases not on the list above (as the list has grown longer, we froze the list and maintain a list of countries passing the 5000-case mark):

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 8 757 734, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. The global case count rose by 2.1% in the past 24 hours. The USA, with more than 2.29 million confirmed cases, now represents 26.2% of the global cases of COVID-19, and Brazil, having crossed the 1 million mark (more than 1.10 million), represents 11.9% of the global cases of COVID-19. Other countries such as Chile, Peru, Mexico, India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Pakistan are reporting increased numbers of new and cumulative cases as well. A global total of 462 519 deaths have been reported, an increase of 6250 deaths in the past 24 hours. A reminder that in the absence of well-developed contact tracing activities with testing of asymptomatic and mildly ill contacts, numbers of SARS-CoV-2 virus infections are significantly underreported: Actual numbers may be 10 to 20 times larger. There are also individuals who stay at home throughout their illness, sometimes, unfortunately, dying at home, who are never officially confirmed as infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These data are presented to provide relative indicators of the situations in each of the countries and comparisons between countries and regions of the world.

In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19, followed by Brazil, Russia, India, the UK, Spain, Peru, Italy, Chile and Iran at number 10. China is number 21. In descending rank order, Brazil is number 1 for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by the USA, India, Russia, Chile, Mexico, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Peru -- all countries that are currently experiencing major community-based transmission.

The top 20 countries in terms of absolute cumulative cases include 7 from the European region, 6 from the Americas region, 4 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 from the South East Asia region, and 1 from the Western Pacific region, unchanged in the past 48 hours. There are no countries from the Africa region. The top 20 countries with most newly confirmed cases include 8 from the Americas region, 5 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 from the European region, 3 from the South East Asia region, and 1 from the African region, none from the Western Pacific region -- having added 1 new country in the America's region, and decreasing 1 country from the European region. The new country in the America's region is Argentina, now reporting over 2000 new cases in the past 24 hours and having progressed rapidly from the 41st in ranking to the 31st in ranking over the past 2 weeks. This listing very much reflects the "hot spots" in terms of countries and regions with ongoing high transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. - Mod.MPP]
