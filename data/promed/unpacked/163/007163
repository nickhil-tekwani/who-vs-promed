WA state veterinarian investigating reported cow deaths at dairy
-------------------------
State animal health officials are investigating
reports of dead cows at a Stevens County dairy
farm, a Washington State Department of Agriculture spokesman said today.
The investigation by state Veterinarian Dr.
Leonard Eldridge was in the initial stages, spokesman Jason Kelly said.
"We don't have any information that would lead us
to identify one cause of illness or death," Kelly
said. "Right now, we're just investigating these
reports we've gotten about diseased animals."
Kelly said state investigators previously had
been at the dairy near Addy, about 75 miles north
of Spokane and about 50 miles south of the
Canadian border. No milk had been sold or
distributed there since December [2007], Kelly said.
The investigation was prompted by reports that
dead animals were seen at the dairy. Kelly
declined to give details, including how many
animals were involved, whether there were actual
deaths or to identify the dairy.
"Reports prompted us to begin an animal health investigation," he said.
Officials from the U.S. Department of Agriculture
and U.S. Food and Drug Administration were aiding
the investigation, Kelly and others said.
Alan Bennett, a spokesman with the FDA in
Portland, said his agency has been in contact
with state agriculture officials, but noted it is
not uncommon for the agency to work with state officials.
Kelly would not say whether the investigation
involves bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad
cow disease, a chronic, degenerative disease of
the brain and spinal cord in cattle. Cattle can
get the disease through contaminated meat and
bone meal fed to the animal as a protein source.
It's thought that people eating infected beef can
contract the human variant of the disease.
The 1st U.S. case of the deadly brain-wasting
disease was found in a Mabton dairy cow in
December 2003. The herd was destroyed and that
cow's origins were later traced to Canada, where
it was believed to have eaten contaminated feed.
Kelly warned against concluding that the current
diseased animal investigation has any link to BSE.
"The state veterinarian's office is conducting an
investigation right now," Kelly said. "At this
point, we simply don't have any information."

[It is not uncommon for dairies, especially large
ones, to have a dead animal or 2, but what is
interest grabbing here is that milk has not been
sold since December [2007] and both the USDA
(United States Department of Agriculture) and the
FDA (Food and Drug Administration) are involved,
as well as a state agency. Although it is not
uncommon for agencies to cooperate in an
investigation, a dead animal case more often
involves local authorities. If the dairy has not
sold milk since December [2007], then it is curious that FDA would be there.
We would appreciate any authoritative information that is available. � Mod.TG]
