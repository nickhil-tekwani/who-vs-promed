SAIMIRI, UNDIAGNOSED DEATHS - RUSSIA (MOSCOW ZOO): REQUEST FOR INFO

During this week we are facing the problem of sudden deaths of squirrel
Saimiri in the Department of Primates of the Moscow Zoo. It looks like
[an] epidemic, because within a week 7 monkeys (_Saimiri sciureus_) of
different age and sex have died.
The symptoms of the disease are: apathy, damaged coordination of movements,
specific posture [?], hard and frequent breathing, palpation of the abdomen
is painful, however complete anorexia is not taking place, i.e. the animal
continues to take food.
The only outer sign of the disease is evident stagnation in peripheral
venous network. The death in fact is the result of edema of lungs.
Postmortem changes are as follows: in the pleural cavity there is up to 5
ml of serous pink or red fluid. There are points of changes in the lung
tissue with ischemia and necrosis. Lymph nodes in the thoracic region are
substantially enlarged. The liver has no macroscopic changes, but the
spleen is enlarged to twice its normal size. Both kidneys are swollen and
enlarged, and the kidney capsule is tense. Under the capsule there are
multiple vesicles, about 1-1.5 mm in diameter. Abdominal lymph nodes are
slightly enlarged. The intestine is without evident macroscopic changes.
The course of treatment of all the Saimiri is with antibiotics and immune
modulators, which were started after the death of the first 2 animals, but
it has not stopped this "epidemic".
We would greatly appreciate your participation in discussing this problem
and would be really obliged for your kind advice or help.
