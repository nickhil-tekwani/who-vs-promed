Germany has reported an outbreak of carbapenemase-producing (NDM-1 and OXA-48) and colistin-resistant _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ sequence type (ST) 307. As of [21 Oct 2019], 17 patients in 3 hospitals and one rehabilitation clinic in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania in north east Germany have been affected. Six of the 17 cases presented with clinical symptoms of infection, while 11 were identified as carriers.

This is the 1st reported outbreak in Germany of _K. pneumoniae_ that produce both NDM-1 and OXA-48 while also involving the emerging clone ST307. The outbreak strain is closely related to a _K. pneumoniae_ ST307 isolate producing the same carbapenemases detected earlier in Finland from a patient previously hospitalised in Russia, yet there is no epidemiological link between the Finnish case and the outbreak in Germany.

_K. pneumoniae_ ST307 is a high-risk clone expanding globally, including in the EU/EEA. The specific German outbreak strain carries virulence markers associated with increased ability to cause disease. Genetic characteristics related to a potential survival advantage in the environment have also been described for _K. pneumoniae_ ST307. The combination of extensive antimicrobial resistance, increased virulence and capacity to persist in the environment result in a high risk for dissemination and future healthcare-associated outbreaks of this _K. pneumoniae_ ST307 outbreak strain in hospitals and other healthcare settings. By contrast, the risk of transmission for individuals outside healthcare settings is low. Enhanced control measures have been implemented in the involved German hospitals, and no further cases have been detected since the end of September 2019.

The highly virulent and resistant _K. pneumoniae_ strain of this outbreak was introduced to the EU/EEA in at least 2 countries in 2019: Germany and Finland. As not all EU/EEA countries have an effective screening system for carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) in high-risk patients and may also lack the capacity to perform whole genome sequencing (WGS) -- or do not routinely use WGS on all carbapenem-resistant _K. pneumoniae_ isolates collected at the national level -- the number of such imported events may be considerably underestimated. In addition, several other high-risk clones of carbapenemase-producing _K. pneumoniae_ have been spreading in hospitals and other healthcare settings in the EU/EEA in recent years. Hospital admissions of patients with previous hospitalisations, including prior hospitalisation in another country, are a daily occurrence in the EU/EEA, and the risk for further introduction of such high-risk clones of _K. pneumoniae_ to hospitals in the EU/EEA, possibly resulting in other hospital outbreaks, is therefore high.

This outbreak also highlights the concomitant increase in virulence, transmissibility and antimicrobial resistance among certain _K. pneumoniae_ strains, which are posing a considerably higher risk to human health than has previously been the case with the broader _K. pneumoniae_ population. Early detection of such strains and close cooperation between clinicians and public health services are crucial to avoid spread into the EU patient population. There is a need for increased capacity in the EU/EEA to support outbreak investigations and surveillance with real-time WGS to identify high-risk clones and to implement enhanced control measures in order to avoid further spread.

[Klebsiella have been known to develop multiple antimicrobial drug resistance, commonly due to production of beta-lactamases that destroy the class of beta-lactam antibiotics known as carbapenems, as well as all other beta-lactam antibiotics. These carbapenemases include the KPCs -- that is, _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemases, as well as other carbapenemases including OXA-48 and the metallo-carbapenemases, NDM and VIM. Some multidrug-resistant strains have also been found to produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs). The genes that encode carbapenemases and ESBLs are plasmid-mediated, which readily facilitates horizontal gene transfer between bacteria. The genes that encode these beta-lactamases are often linked to genes that encode resistance to multiple other classes of antibiotics. The principal reservoir for these organisms is the gastrointestinal tract, and spread occurs from there on the contaminated hands of healthcare workers and environment.

_K. pneumoniae_ ST307 is an internationally emerging high-risk clone in healthcare-associated outbreaks. Carbapenem resistance in ST307 in previous studies was mostly mediated by KPC-2 and KPC-3. Most isolates also carried the ESBL CTX-M-15. In 2016, ProMED-mail posted a report of a 2014 outbreak caused by colistin-resistant OXA-48-producing _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ in the French regions Ile-de-France and Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur (Antibiotic resistance - France: non-MCR-1, colistin/carbapenem, 2014 20160916.4492825). Three strains belonged to sequence type ST307.

The strain causing the current outbreak in Germany contained the virulence genes encoding for aerobactin and yersiniabactin and produced both the carbapenemases NDM-1 and OXA-48, was resistant to colistin, and belonged to sequence type ST307. No plasmid-encoded _mcr-1_ gene was identified among these carbapenemase-producing isolates; rather, colistin resistance was likely due to chromosomal encoded mechanisms.

Clinically, both the carbapenems and colistin are "antibiotics of last resort" -- that is, used in situations in which the patient is seriously infected with a multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacillus resistant to all antimicrobial drugs, except for these few drugs. In the above study, the _K. pneumoniae_ outbreak strain was resistant to penicillins (piperacillin-tazobactam, temocillin), cephalosporins including combinations with beta-lactamase inhibitors (cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftazidime-avibactam, ceftolozane-tazobactam and cefepime), carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem, doripenem), aztreonam, fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin), aminoglycosides (amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin), fosfomycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and colistin. It was susceptible only to chloramphenicol, tigecycline and cefiderocol, a siderophore cephalosporin; the latter was recently recommended for approval by the FDA in the USA for treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (https://www.healio.com/infectious-disease/antimicrobials/news/online/%7B7f332525-b0b2-4648-8848-7544d2ed74c0%7D/fda-advisory-committee-supports-approval-of-cefiderocol-for-complicated-utis). - Mod.ML
