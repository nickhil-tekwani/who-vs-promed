An outbreak of bubonic plague in Uganda has killed 14 people in the last 3
weeks, officials said. A government health official said on Thursday that
the disease is believed to have been caused by an influx of rats into
several villages.
The rats entered 4 villages in the northwestern Nebbi district near the
Congo border, said Dr. Dam Okware, who is coordinating the government's
efforts to halt the spread of the fatal disease. The rats normally live
outside the villages but seek shelter during the annual rainy season, he
told Reuters.
So far, 23 people have been infected with the disease, which affects the
lymph nodes, and 14 have died. No new cases have been reported since 3 Oct
2001, Okware said.
The bacterial disease is transmitted from rodents to humans by fleas living
on the infected animals. Humans can also get it through direct contact with
infected blood or tissues.
There are 3 different variations of plague, including bubonic, all of which
are treatable with antibiotics if diagnosed in time. Symptoms in people
include sudden high fever, chills, headache, muscle aches and sometimes
nausea or vomiting.
At least three major plague outbreaks have claimed 200 million lives in the
past 1500 years. In 541 A.D., the first outbreak swept through the Roman
Empire. Europe's Black Death started in 1347, killing 25 million in Europe
and 13 million in the Middle East and China within five years. The third
major outbreak started in China in 1894 and by 1900 it had spread
worldwide, killing 12.5 million in India alone. A large outbreak was
contained in Los Angeles in 1924-25.
