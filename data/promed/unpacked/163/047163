The Department of Health [of Western Australia]
today urged people living and holidaying in the
north of Western Australia to take extra care
against mosquito bites,following evidence of
mosquito-borne viruses in the east Kimberley and
east Pilbara regions.
Department of Health Medical Entomologist Dr Mike
Lindsay said that the Departmentï¿½surveillance
program (undertaken by The University of Western
Australia) had detected activity of Kunjin virus
for the first time this wet season.
"Kunjin virus, which is carried by mosquitoes,
belongs to the same group of viruses as Murray
Valley encephalitis (MVE) virus," he said. [And
is a member of the Japanese encephalitis complex
of viruses. - Mod. TY]
"Infection with Kunjin virus can cause symptoms
that are similar to Ross River virus disease,
such as swollen and aching joints, fever and
rash. However, in rare cases it can cause more
severe symptoms, like MVE, which include
headache, neck stiffness, fever, delirium and
coma.
"In young children, fever might be the only early
sign, so parents should see their doctor if
concerned, and particularly if their child
experiences drowsiness, floppiness, irritability,
poor feeding, or general distress."
People most likely to be affected by the Kunjin
or MVE virus are newcomers to affected regions,
such as babies, young children, tourists or new
employees, but anyone experiencing these symptoms
should seek medical advice quickly.
"Wet season activity of mosquito-borne viruses
now appears to be well underway in the north,
with a few reported cases of Ross River and
Barmah Forest viruses as well," Dr Lindsay said.
There are no specific cures or vaccines for
Kunjin, MVE, Ross River or Barmah Forest viruses
so it is very important that people take care to
prevent being bitten by mosquitoes.
The warning particularly applies to people
living, visiting or camping near swamp and river
systems during the evening and night through the
north-east Kimberley and mosquito-prone areas of
the Pilbara. However, the viruses may be active
elsewhere in the north of the state, especially
where mosquitoes are abundant.
"Controlling mosquitoes in most rural regions of
WA is generally not possible because of the large
size and inaccessibility of natural mosquito
breeding habitat," Dr Lindsay said.
People do not need to alter their plans to visit
the Kimberley or Pilbara as a result of this
warning. However, it is important to avoid
mosquito bites by taking a few simple steps, such
as:
* avoiding outdoor exposure from dusk and at
night in all areas of high mosquito activity;
* wearing protective (long, loose-fitting) clothing when outdoors; and
* using a personal repellent containing diethyl toluamide (DEET) or
picaridin. The most effective and long-lasting formulations are lotions or
gels. Most natural or organic repellents are not as effective as DEET or
picaridin;
* ensuring insect screens are installed and
completely mosquito-proof: use mosquito nets and
mosquito-proof tents;
* ensuring infants and children are adequately
protected against mosquito bites, preferably with
suitable clothing, bed nets or other forms of
insect screening.

[Professor John Mackenzie commented in archive no. 20010208.0249:
"Kunjin virus is not restricted to Australia. In
all, 3 isolates of Kunjin virus were obtained
from Sarawak, Borneo in 1966, by Bowen and
colleagues (Bowen, et al. Ann Trop Med Parasitol
1970; 64: 263-8).
In addition, Hawkes, Marshall, and our laboratory
have found serological evidence of Kunjin virus
in Papua New Guinea, and Olson [and colleagues]
and Kanamitsu [and colleagues] have found
serological evidence of Kunjin virus in parts of
the eastern Indonesian archipelago. We have also
recently isolated Kunjin virus from mosquitoes
trapped on Saibai Island in the Torres Strait,
about 4 km from the coast of Western Province of
Papua New Guinea. Taken one step further, Kunjin
virus has recently been re-classified by the
International Committee for the Taxonomy of
Viruses (ICTV) as a subtype of West Nile virus.
The definition of where Kunjin extends to is not
then quite so simple!"
