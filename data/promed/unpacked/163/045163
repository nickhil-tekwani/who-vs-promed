Headlines
Summary of newly reported viruses this week
- Afghanistan - 1 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1)-positive environmental sample;
- Pakistan - 2 WPV1 cases and 4 WPV1-positive environmental samples; and
- Nigeria - 1 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) case and 3 cVDPV2-positive environmental samples.

Afghanistan
- No cases of WPV1 were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 is 16.
- 1 WPV1-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week from Kandahar, collected on [25 Sep 2018].

Pakistan
- 2 cases of WPV1 were reported in the past week from greater Karachi, Sindh (with onset of paralysis on [22 Sep 2018]) and Khyber district, Fata province (with onset of paralysis on [25 Sep 2018]). The total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 is 6.
- 4 WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week: 3 from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, collected between [18 and 27 Sep 2018], and one from Balochistan, collected on [1 Oct 2018].
- The detection of new cases and positive environmental samples is not unexpected at this time, and underscores the fact that transmission is ongoing in the country. The country continues to implement national emergency action plans to identify remaining immunity gaps and urgently fill these gaps.

Nigeria
- 1 case of cVDPV2 was reported this week from Katsina, with onset of paralysis on [16 Sep 2018]. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 is 17.
-3 cVDPV2-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week, 2 from Yobe and 1 from Bauchi, and collected in August and September [2018].
- These newly reported viruses are all linked to a cVDPV2 originating in Jigawa; this same virus has also been detected in neighbouring Niger. Separately, Nigeria is affected by a 2nd cVDPV2 outbreak, centred around Sokoto state.
- In response to cVDPV2 detection, the country continues to conduct acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance-strengthening activities, including enhanced active surveillance visits and community sampling. The programme has also carried out an extensive search for type 2-containing vaccines (tOPV/mOPV2) in the areas surrounding where the virus is detected.
- At the same time, outbreak response to WPV1 continues, including efforts to address surveillance and immunity gaps in parts of Borno state.

Lake Chad basin
- No new cases of cVDPV2 were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 is 6, from Zinder, Niger. These cases are linked to a cVDPV2 in Jigawa, Nigeria.
- The government of Niger has declared a national public-health emergency, as per the temporary recommendations of the Emergency Committee of the International Health Regulations.
- WHO and its partners are supporting local public-health authorities in field investigations and risk assessment, and to conduct additional response measures as appropriate and necessary. Health workers are conducting active searches for additional AFP cases; surveillance is also being strengthened by taking more environmental samples from more areas and sampling the stools of healthy people.
- The detection of WPV1 and cVDPV2 in Nigeria continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin. Emergency outbreak response and efforts to improve surveillance continue across the basin. These include efforts to vaccinate children at markets, in internally displaced persons and refugee camps, and at international borders.

Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo)
- DR Congo is affected by 3 separate strains of cVDPV2 in the provinces of Mongola, Maniema, and Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri.
- The relevant provincial governors have signed a "Kinshasa Declaration for Polio Eradication," committing to providing the necessary oversight, accountability, and resources needed to stop the outbreak. It is hoped that level of oversight will improve operational performance of the outbreak response.
- The polio outbreak response is being conducted simultaneously with an ongoing Ebola outbreak affecting North Kivu province, in the east of the country (close to provinces affected by cVDPV2). As in the past, the polio teams are coordinating closely with the broader humanitarian emergency network to ensure both outbreaks are addressed in a coordinated manner.

Horn of Africa
- The Horn of Africa is currently affected by separate outbreaks of cVDPV2 and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3), reporting both cases and environmental positives.
- The country is carrying out outbreak response to both virus types in line with internationally agreed-upon guidelines. An outbreak response assessment is due to start on [18 Nov 2018], followed by a technical advisory group meeting.

Papua New Guinea
- No cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV1 cases in 2018 is 18.
- Emergency Operations Centres are established and operational in all affected provinces; environmental surveillance is functional in 5 sites in 2 major cities.
- 3 supplemental immunization activities (SIAs) of expanding scope have taken place since late July [2018], from 3 provinces to 9, to nationwide. The most recent was aimed at children under the age of 15, due to the large numbers of poorly immunized older children.
- Detection and reporting of new viruses or cases at this point in the outbreak response is not unusual or unexpected, as surveillance is being strengthened, and most reported and confirmed cases had onset of paralysis prior to the start of comprehensive outbreak response.

Middle East
- No new cases of cVDPV2 were reported in the past week in Syria. The total number of officially reported cVDPV2 cases in Syria in 2017 remains 74. There are no cases reported in 2018. The most recent case (by date of onset of paralysis) was reported in Boukamal district, with onset on [21 Sep 2017].

[Well, all 3 cases reported in the media and posted in Poliomyelitis update (50): Nigeria (BA), cVDPV2, Pakistan (SD) follow-up 20181020.6102512 and Poliomyelitis update (49): global (WPV1, cVDPV), Pakistan (non-paralytic), RFI 20181018.6099294 were confirmed in this week's GPEI update, demonstrating the value of the media in early warnings of emerging diseases. It is important to note that as of this week [week of 22 Oct 2018], the number of cases of WPV1-associated paralytic disease is now at the final total number for 2017. One suspects that there will be more cases identified during the remainder of the year [2018] and in early 2019, with dates of onset in 2018, hence a higher tally than seen in 2017.

It is too soon to declare transmission interrupted in those countries not reporting newly confirmed cases this week, especially with the identification of the polioviruses in environmental samples. The update on the state of VDPVs in the following section ([2] below) is a good technical summary of what we have been observing.

[2] Update on cVDPVs - MMWR
Date: Fri 26 Oct 2018

Update on Vaccine-Derived Polioviruses - Worldwide, January 2017-June 2018
26 Oct 2018 / 67(42);1189-1194

Jorba J, Diop OM, Iber J, et al. Update on Vaccine-Derived Polioviruses - Worldwide, January 2017-June 2018. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2018; 67:1189-1194.

Since the Global Polio Eradication Initiative was launched in 1988 (1), the number of polio cases worldwide has declined by greater than 99.99%. Among the 3 wild poliovirus (WPV) serotypes, only type 1 (WPV1) has been detected since 2012. This decline is attributable primarily to use of the live, attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in national routine immunization schedules and mass vaccination campaigns. The success and safety record of OPV use is offset by the rare emergence of genetically divergent vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs), whose genetic drift from the parental OPV strains indicates prolonged replication or circulation (2). Circulating VDPVs (cVDPVs) can emerge in areas with low immunization coverage and can cause outbreaks of paralytic polio. In addition, immunodeficiency-associated VDPVs (iVDPVs) can emerge in persons with primary immunodeficiencies and can replicate and be excreted for years. This report presents data on VDPVs detected during January 2017-June 2018 and updates previous VDPV summaries (3). During this reporting period, new cVDPV outbreaks were detected in 5 countries. 14 newly identified persons in 9 countries were found to excrete iVDPVs. Ambiguous VDPVs (aVDPVs), isolates that cannot be classified definitively, were found among immunocompetent persons and environmental samples in 7 countries.

Global eradication of type 2 WPV (WPV2) was declared in 2015; type 3 WPV (WPV3) was last detected in 2012. The number of detected WPV1 cases has reached a historic low (22 cases in 2017 and 18 as of September 2018) in 2 of the 3 countries with endemic WPV1 transmission (Afghanistan and Pakistan); in Nigeria, WPV1 was last detected in September 2016. After the emergence of multiple cVDPV2 outbreaks during the preceding 15 years, in April 2016, all OPV-using countries switched from using trivalent OPV (tOPV; Sabin types 1, 2, and 3) to bivalent OPV (bOPV; Sabin types 1 and 3). To control and prevent cVDPV2 outbreaks, approximately 100 million doses of monovalent type 2 OPV (mOPV2) have been distributed in 11 countries (4). To maintain protection from poliovirus type 2 paralysis, 176 OPV-using countries have introduced at least 1 dose of injectable inactivated polio vaccine beginning in 2015.

Properties and Virologic Characterization of VDPVs
Poliovirus isolates are characterized by laboratories of the Global Polio Laboratory Network. VDPV screening is conducted using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction nucleic acid amplification, followed by sequencing of the VP1 region. VDPVs are isolates that are greater than 1% divergent (for PV1 and PV3) or greater than 0.6% divergent (for PV2) in VP1 nucleotide sequences from the corresponding OPV strain (3). Starting [1 Aug 2016], use of the VDPV2 screening assay was discontinued, and all PV2 isolates have been sequenced. VDPVs are further classified as 1) cVDPVs, when evidence of person-to-person transmission in the community exists; 2) iVDPVs, when they are isolated from persons with primary immunodeficiencies; and 3) aVDPVs, when they are clinical isolates from persons with no known immunodeficiency and no evidence of transmission, or they are sewage isolates that are unrelated to other known VDPVs and whose source is unknown (2).

Detection of cVDPVs
During January 2017-June 2018, cVDPV circulation was detected in 6 countries, an increase of 1 since the previous reporting period (3) (Figure 1. Vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) detected - worldwide, January 2017-June 2018); 5 countries reported cVDPV2 circulation (Democratic Republic of the Congo [DRC], Kenya, Nigeria, Somalia, and Syria [available at the source URL]); cVDPV1 was reported in Papua New Guinea (Table). Cases of cVDPV (in patients with acute flaccid paralysis [AFP]) continued to be identified from the previously reported (3) cVDPV2 outbreaks in Syria and DRC (5,6). No additional cases were reported from the cVDPV2 outbreaks 1st reported in Nigeria and Pakistan in 2016. New outbreaks were reported in DRC (3 cVDPV2 emergences); Somalia (1 cVDPV2 emergence and 1 cVDPV3 emergence) with linked cVPDV2 isolation in sewage in Kenya (7); Nigeria (2 cVDPV2 emergences); and Papua New Guinea (1 cVDPV1 emergence) (Table. Vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) detected, by classification and other selected characteristics - worldwide, January 2017-June 2018). During the reporting period, 113 cVDPV2 cases were detected (Table), including 74 in Syria, 33 in DRC, 4 in Nigeria, and 2 in Somalia. The large cVDPV2 outbreak in Syria (3) was apparently interrupted in 2017; the last reported cases had paralysis onset in September 2017. 3 cVDPV1 cases were detected in Papua New Guinea, and 3 cVDPV3 cases were detected in Somalia (Table). 62 cVDPVs were isolated from sewage sampling in environmental surveillance sites in Kenya, Nigeria, and Somalia. After June 2018, newly identified VDPVs linked to emergences during the reporting period were detected in all outbreak countries except Syria. During January 2017-June 2018, among 119 cVDPV cases, 113 (95%) were cVDPV2, which represented a serotype profile similar to that of the previous 12 years (Figure 2 Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) cases detected, by serotype (N = 917) - worldwide, January 2000-June 2018*).

Selected cVDPV Emergences from the Reporting Period
Democratic Republic of the Congo. 3 distinct cVDPV2 emergences (designated HLO-1, MAN-1, and MON-1, per detection location and number of emergences in a geographic region) were detected during February 2017-June 2018. The HLO-1 emergence circulated in Haut Katanga, Haut Lomami, Ituri, and Tanganyika provinces. The MAN-1 and MON-1 emergences had limited circulation in Maniema and Mongala provinces, respectively. Multiple supplementary immunization rounds with mOPV2 were conducted in outbreak provinces and adjacent high-risk areas in response to the cVDPV2 emergences.

Horn of Africa (Kenya and Somalia). 2 distinct cVDPV emergences were detected during October 2017-May 2018. A cVDPV2 emergence (designated BAN-1) was detected in 3 environmental sites in Mogadishu, Somalia, (Banaadir province) and in 1 environmental site in Nairobi, Kenya. 2 cVDPV2 cases linked to BAN-1 also were detected in Gedo and Hiran provinces of Somalia. A cVDPV3 emergence (BAN-2) also was detected in the same 3 environmental sites; during February-May 2018, cVDPV3s associated with BAN-2 emergence were detected in 3 environmental sites in Mogadishu and in 3 cases in Middle Shabelle and Hiran provinces of Somalia. The launch of a new environmental sampling site in Mogadishu, Somalia, in October 2017 led to the immediate detection of type 2 cVDPV and subsequent detection of 2 type 3 cVDPVs and 1 aVDPV2. Outbreak response included 3 supplementary immunization rounds with mOPV2 in Somalia (December 2017-May 2018) and 1 mOPV2 round in Kenya (May 2018).

Nigeria. During January-June 2018, 2 concurrent cVDPV2 emergences were detected in Nigeria, one in the states of Gombe, Jigawa, and Yobe (designated JIS-1), and the other in Sokoto state (SOS-3). The JIS-1 emergence was detected in 18 cVDPV2 isolates from environmental samples and in isolates from 4 persons with AFP. 17 SOS-3 cVDPV2s were isolated from sewage samples collected in Sokoto. Outbreak response included 2 supplementary immunization rounds with mOPV2 conducted in 4 states (Bauchi, Gombe, Jigawa, and Sokoto) in May 2018.

Papua New Guinea. During April-June 2018, circulating VDPV1s were isolated from 3 patients with AFP and 2 contacts in the provinces of Easter Highlands and Morobe. Reported routine vaccine coverage at the subnational level has been low (50%) for years; bOPV outbreak response campaigns are ongoing.

Detection of iVDPVs
During January 2017-June 2018, 14 iVDPVs were reported from 9 countries, including 7 type 3 iVDPVs (iVDPV3), 5 type 2 iVDPVs (iVDPV2), and 2 type 1 iVDPVs (iVDPV1). (Table). 6 of the iVDPV isolates were newly detected since the last report. Since introduction of OPV in 1961, the cumulative iVDPV serotype distribution is iVDPV2 (66%), iVDPV3 (17%), iVDPV1 (12%), and heterotypic mixes (i.e., types 1 and 2 or types 2 and 3) (5%).

Detection of aVDPVs
During January 2017-June 2018, the number of countries with detected aVDPVs decreased to 7 from 11 described in the previous report (3) (Table). Among 28 detected aVDPVs, 23 were type 2 (aVDPV2) (predominantly after mOPV2 responses to cVDPV outbreaks), 4 were type 3 (aVDPV3), and 1 was type 1 (aVDPV1); 23 (82%) aVDPVs were isolated from environmental samples. Detection of aVDPVs in settings with less than 60% polio vaccination coverage might indicate a risk for cVDPV emergence and further spread. A highly divergent aVDPV2 (8.4% VP1 divergence) was isolated from an environmental sample collected in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia on [21 Nov 2017]. This environmental isolate had genomic sequence characteristics compatible with iVDPVs.

Discussion
During January 2017-June 2018, the number of reported cVDPV outbreaks and the total number of reported cVDPV cases in these outbreaks increased from the January 2016-June 2017 reporting period (3); new cVDPVs were detected in DRC, Kenya, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, and Somalia during the January 2017-June 2018 reporting period. Cases have continued to be identified in 2018 after this reporting period in DRC, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, and Somalia.

The continued expansion of sewage sampling (244 sites in 41 countries) (8) has increased the frequency of detection of WPV, VDPV, and residual PV2 excretion after mOPV2 vaccination during outbreak responses. As of April 2018, the number of environmental sites in countries with recent active WPV transmission (Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan) increased from 21 at the end of 2011 to 153. Partially as a result of supplemental surveillance measures for VDPVs among patients with primary immunodeficiencies (9), the number of known iVDPV excretors has increased; the antiviral pocapavir has recently been used to treat iVDPV excretors under compassionate-use protocols in 3 countries (Task Force for Global Health, personal communication, October 2018).

Gaps in immunity to poliovirus type 2 remain in high-risk areas and continue to increase with time after the 2016 tOPV-to-bOPV switch. Continued detection of VDPV2s in 2017 and into 2018 underscores the existence of substantial populations of children who missed PV2 immunization before the switch. Some cVDPV2 detections occurred in or near security-compromised areas (DRC, Somalia, and Syria), where surveillance quality is uncertain. Likewise, new type 1 and type 3 cVDPV outbreaks highlight the importance of maintaining high levels of poliovirus immunity against these serotypes, as well as sensitive AFP surveillance. During the reporting period, VDPV cases outnumbered WPV cases; however, documentation of eradication of WPV is required before global OPV use can cease. Cessation of all OPV use after certification of polio eradication will eliminate the risk for VDPV emergence.
