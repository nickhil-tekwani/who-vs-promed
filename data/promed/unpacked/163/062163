[A temporary suspension of control efforts for any reason is a serious setback. One wonders how long this disruption of field activities will have to continue. No one really knows how long it will take for calm to return, but what an unfortunate exacerbation of the health and safety insecurity that exists in the region. See the following report to read more about this regrettable challenge facing the DRC. - Mod.LK]

[2] Unrest disrupts control effort
- Sun 23 Sep 2018. Rebel attack in Congo Ebola zone kills 18
[Reuters, edited]

At least 14 civilians and 4 soldiers were killed on [Sat 22 Sep 2018] in a 6-hour attack by rebels on the town of Beni in eastern Congo, the army and local officials said, disrupting efforts to contain an Ebola epidemic in the area.

The latest outbreak of the deadly disease in Democratic Republic of Congo has been focused in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, which have been a tinderbox of armed rebellion and ethnic killing since 2 civil wars in the late 1990s.

Militants believed to belong to the Allied Democratic Forces, a Ugandan Islamist group active in eastern Congo, clashed with Congolese troops in Beni, a town of several hundred thousand people, local civil society leader Kizito Bin Hangi said by telephone.

"Beni is ungovernable this morning. Several protests have been declared in the town where the people express their anger with consternation," he said.

In addition to the known fatalities, dozens of civilians were wounded as they fled the violence, which broke out in the early hours of Saturday evening [22 Sep 2018] and lasted until midnight, Bin Hangi added.

During a news conference in Beni on [Sun 23 Sep 2018], a representative of the Congolese army said 4 soldiers had also been killed in the attack. Spokesman Mak Hazukay confirmed the civilian death toll of 14, but said 6 civilians and 4 military personnel had been wounded -- lower figures than estimated by the civil society leader.

The attack underscores the challenges the government and health organizations face in tackling Ebola in an area where years of instability has undermined locals' confidence in the authorities.

Community unrest in the wake of the latest violence prompted the Health Ministry to suspend temporarily the field work it has been carrying out in Beni as part of its Ebola response.

"Many inhabitants of the town of Beni took to the streets this [Sun 23 Sep 2018] to protest against the growing insecurity in the zone. The field work of the response will resume once calm returns to the town," the ministry said in its daily Ebola report.

The latest outbreak, which causes haemorrhagic fever, vomiting, and diarrhea, is believed to have killed 99 people since July [2018] and infected another 48.

[The assault is believed to have been led by rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF). ... Congolese military official Mak Hazukai confirmed the attack and told AFP (Agence France-Presse) news agency that "the territory and the city of Beni are facing ADF terrorism, whose command structure is led by Ugandans."

The ADF militia was initially created by Muslim rebels to oppose Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, but it has spread its operations into the DRC's North Kivu province, a hotbed of armed rebellion and ethnic conflict since the late 1990s.

Community unrest followed the attack in Beni and prompted the Health Ministry to temporarily suspend its efforts to contain the current Ebola outbreak, highlighting the challenges authorities face in dealing with a public health emergency in the unstable region.

According to the BBC, it appears that treatment centers remain open but vaccinations and the tracing of people who have been in contact with suspected Ebola patients have stopped for now. (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-45625735)

Note that it was actually the community unrest as a result of the armed conflict that led to suspension of control efforts. This unsettled situation is exactly what has been of great concern to the agencies involved in control. No matter how close the country comes to having the outbreak under control, there is always the danger of an undetected case in a region of instability where contacts cannot be followed. Further contributing to concern is travel to new locations by the militia or civilians, making further spread a high risk. - Mod.LK
