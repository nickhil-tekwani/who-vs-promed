Fears that avian influenza has taken hold in Turkey are growing after the
death of a 2nd teenager and evidence that the disease is infecting birds in
at least 3 areas of the country, hundreds of miles apart. Samples of the
virus from birds and from the 1st human victim, aged 14, were flown to
laboratories in Britain yesterday for confirmation that the virus is the
same H5N1 avian influenza virus that has caused more than 70 deaths in Asia.
11 other people, including 2 members of the same family, are being treated
in Van, eastern Turkey, where the boy's sister, age 15, became the 2nd
victim yesterday.
She died despite treatment with Tamiflu, the antiviral drug that is the
only known defence against the infection. Among others being treated are
her 11-year-old sister, who remains in a weak condition, and her brother,
age 6 [The death of the younger sister has now been reported; see report
below. - Mod.CP]. The family is from the remote town of Dogubeyazit in the
province of Agri, near the borders with Iran and Armenia and about 60 miles
south of Aralik, where vets detected the 2nd outbreak last week.
In Van, Huseyin Avni Sahin, the head physician of the Yuzuncu Yil
University Hospital, said that he was expecting another 5 suspected cases.
In Igdir province to the north, 6 more people were taken to hospital with
suspected bird flu.
The 14-year-old boy was buried yesterday [Thu 5 Jan 2006] by an imam
wearing a mask, and lime was spread over his grave. Turkish officials are
almost sure that the cause of his death was the H5N1 strain, but this will
not be confirmed until tests have been completed at the World Health
Organisation influenza laboratory in Colindale, North London. [These tests
have now been completed and confirm the presence of the H5N1 virus in the
deceased patient. - Mod.CP].
At the same time, tests on samples taken from the birds are being carried
out at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency in Weybridge, Surrey. The extent
of the outbreaks in Turkey has dismayed experts. Although the risks were
clear, the Turkish authorities have not been able to prevent the spread to
people. Mehdi Eker, the Turkish Agriculture Minister, who flew to the
region yesterday, said that bird flu had now been identified in 5 separate
places. This could mean that the extent of the outbreak in poultry in
Turkey has been underestimated, or that the virus can jump more easily from
birds to people, according to Professor John Oxford, of Queen Mary's School
of Medicine and Dentistry in London. "It is surprising that there are 2
[now 3] deaths and a number of people have been infected in what we thought
to be a rather small outbreak," he said.
Worried local people went to hospitals in Dogubeyazit, forcing hospital
staff to call the police. Doctors said that they were inundated with calls
from people saying that they had slaughtered and eaten sick birds. Contrite
villagers handed over chickens that they had kept from health officials.
Newspaper reports said that the Kocyigit family had moved their chickens
into the house for the winter. Doctors at the hospital said that the
children had played with the infected chickens' remains, including the
head, after eating the birds. Turkish officials imposed a ban on the sale
and movement of animals in the region. Agriculture officials in Dogubayazit
have culled 1500 fowl and aimed to kill the remaining 2000 yesterday before
burying them outside the town.
Hugh Pennington, president of the Society of General Microbiology, said
that: "This shows we have to keep our vigilance up but the picture hasn't
changed. It's still an avian virus and hasn't mutated to enable
human-to-human infection. So the message is, Don't panic!" A spokeswoman
for the Department of Health said: "The level of risk has not changed.
There is no human-to-human transmission. We have robust systems in place
for monitoring this."

A 3rd child from the same family in eastern Turkey died from bird flu on
Friday [6 Jan 2006], and health experts plan to study the outbreak for
signs the virus was passing from person to person.
Doctors were treating more than 20 other people, mostly youngsters,
suspected of having the deadly virus. Some of the victims had been playing
with the severed heads of infected birds, doctors said. The H5N1 bird flu
virus has killed 74 people in East Asia and has now spread to the fringes
of Europe. It has so far been hard for people to catch, but there are fears
it could mutate into a form easily transmitted among humans. Experts say a
pandemic among humans could kill millions and cause massive economic losses.
A spokeswoman in Geneva said the World Health Organisation (WHO) was
sending experts to the area who would check for any signs the virus had
been passed from person to person -- something that has happened in only
one previous but unconfirmed case [in East Asia - Mod.CP]. "It is possible
that they all had common exposure to sick poultry but it is also possible
there may have been human-to-human transmission. We don't have enough
information to draw a hypothesis either way," WHO spokeswoman Maria Cheng
said. "That is certainly one of the possibilities that the team is going to
be investigating," she added.
The latest child to die was 11 years old, the sister of the 14-year-old boy
who died last weekend, and of the 15-year-old girl who died on Thursday.
She was buried alongside her brother and sister on Friday in a lime-covered
grave. Final tests at a WHO laboratory [in the UK] have confirmed 2 of the
victims had [contracted avian influenza]. The additional tests are carried
out to confirm the preliminary diagnosis and it normally takes a few days
for the [confirmatory] results to come through.
Turkey's Minister of Agriculture said bird flu had been detected in 2 wild
ducks near the capital Ankara, nearly 1000 km (700 miles) west of infected
areas where the 3 children died. The discovery suggests migratory birds may
be spreading the disease across the large country, as experts had warned.
The dead children lived in a remote rural district of eastern Turkey near
the Armenian and Iranian borders, mixing with poultry -- just like the East
Asian victims. Neighbouring Azerbaijan is also going to run tests on
suspect dead birds.
Doctors treating victims at a hospital in the eastern city of Van said the
disease had been contracted from sick birds. "All our patients have been in
close proximity to poultry. Some patients handled the infected poultry,
some of them were even playing with the heads of chickens," BBC television
quoted doctor Ahmet Faik Oner as saying.
A joint WHO/European Commission team is expected to arrive in eastern
Turkey on Friday. 4 more WHO experts will go to Turkey at the weekend.
Doctors said more than 20 people were being treated for suspected avian
influenza in hospital in the eastern city of Van. The patients, many of
them children, come from several provinces across eastern Turkey. 6
children were being tested for suspected bird flu in the city of
Diyarbakir, hundreds of kilometres southwest of the area so far affected,
hospital officials said.
The dead children's 6-year-old brother was also being treated for [symptoms
of] the same disease in hospital. But their parents were in good health as
they received visitors paying condolences at their tiny one-room cottage in
the town of Dogubayazit. "There is no doctor here, we are very poor," a
relative told Reuters in a tent set up near the house to accommodate the
flood of visitors.
In Dogubayazit, an anxious crowd gathered outside the state agricultural
offices to dump sacks of dead poultry or ask for their poultry to be
culled. "After the deaths everybody is scared. We are all getting rid of
our chickens and nobody dares eat their meat," said local trader Devlet Kaya.
The WHO said in a statement dated Thursday [5 Jan 2006] that the Turkish
authorities had told it that the district had been placed under quarantine,
with no people or animals allowed to move in or out. However, a Reuters
reporter there on Friday saw no controls.

[Some new aspects of the epidemic situation in Turkey compared with those
pertaining in East Asia appear to be the following:
(1) relatively small outbreaks of disease in poultry in at least 5 widely
separated places (several hundred kilometres apart);
(2) larger number of confirmed (3) and suspected (more than 20) human cases
in a limited time-frame;
(3) children apparently at greater risk of infection;
(4) ineffectiveness of Tamiflu treatment in at least one case;
(5) failure of poultry culling and quarantine of population to contain the
outbreak; and
(6) for the 1st time serious consideration of the possibility of some
limited person-to-person transmission.
