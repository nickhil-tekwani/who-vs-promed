P.cantonensis was identified in the spinal cord of a horse in Tonga about
three years ago. I also have unconfirmed reports that it has been
incriminated in similar locations in Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. Dr John
Bowskill was the veterinarian in Tonga at that time - he has since returned
to Australia but I do have a contact address if anyone wishes to follow up.

What stage of the parasite was found?
The parasite has been reported from New Orleans in rats and monkeys in
the zoo, also one human case.
