[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 2 250 450 with 82 719 (3.7%) cases reported by China. There are now a total of 2 167 731 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from 213 countries/locations outside mainland China, representing an increase of 67 901 cases when compared with the data on 16 Apr 2020. The total number of confirmed cases reported from outside China now represents 96.3% of the total number of reported cases. The epicenter has shifted outside of China to Western Europe and the USA. The USA now represents 31.6% of the global cases of COVID-19. A global total of 154 241 deaths have been reported, 149 609 (97.0%) outside mainland China.

The USA is number one outside China for numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19; Spain is number 2 and Italy is number 3. While the number of daily new cases in Iran has slowed down, Turkey and Russia have shown a rapid increase in the number of cases. Turkey will be reporting more cases than China and the UK over the coming days if their daily confirmations stay at the same rate. - Mod.MPP]

[3] Asymptomatic infections: naval ship/homeless shelter
A. Naval ship
Date: Thu 16 Apr 2020 5:25 PM EDT
Source: Reuters [edited]
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-military-sympt/coronavirus-clue-most-cases-aboard-us-aircraft-carrier-are-symptom-free-idUSKCN21Y2GB


Sweeping testing of the entire crew of the coronavirus-stricken US aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt may have revealed a clue about the pandemic: The majority of the positive cases so far are among sailors who are asymptomatic, officials say.

The possibility that the coronavirus spreads in a mostly stealthy mode among a population of largely young, healthy people showing no symptoms could have major implications for US policy-makers, who are considering how and when to reopen the economy. It also renews questions about the extent to which US testing of just the people suspected of being infected is actually capturing the spread of the virus in the United States and around the world.

The Navy's testing of the entire 4800-member crew of the aircraft carrier -- which is about 94% complete -- was an extraordinary move in a headline-grabbing case that has already led to the firing of the carrier's captain and the resignation of the Navy's top civilian official.

Roughly 60 percent of the over 600 sailors who tested positive so far have not shown symptoms of COVID-19, the potentially lethal respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, the Navy says. The service did not speculate about how many might later develop symptoms or remain asymptomatic.

"With regard to COVID-19, we're learning that stealth in the form of asymptomatic transmission is this adversary's secret power," said Rear Admiral Bruce Gillingham, surgeon general of the Navy. The figure is higher than the 25% to 50% range offered on [5 Apr 2020] by Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of President Donald Trump's coronavirus task force.

Defense Secretary Mark Esper, speaking in a television interview on Thursday [16 Apr 2020], said the number of asymptomatic cases from the carrier was "disconcerting." "It has revealed a new dynamic of this virus: that it can be carried by normal, healthy people who have no idea whatsoever that they are carrying it," Esper told NBC's "Today" morning show. Such data present challenges to the Pentagon, which is deployed around the world, sometimes in confined environments like submarines, ships, and aircraft. Testing the entire military is not yet feasible, given still-limited testing capacity, officials say, and detecting enough cases without tests is impossible if most cases are asymptomatic.

The US coronavirus death toll -- the highest in the world -- surged past 31 000 on Thursday [16 Apr 2020] after doubling in a week. It also claimed the life of a sailor from the Theodore Roosevelt this week. 5 other members of the crew are hospitalized. Still, the case of the Theodore Roosevelt offers a case study for researchers about how the virus spreads asymptomatically in a confined environment among mostly younger adults. That cohort has been somewhat underrepresented in the epidemiological data so far, said William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

"The findings are of enormous interest because the proportion of people who are asymptomatic is just simply not known," Schaffner said when asked about the Navy's data. Vice Admiral Phillip Sawyer, a deputy chief of naval operations at the center of the Navy's coronavirus response efforts, presented the 60% figure in a call with a small group of reporters on Wednesday [15 Apr 2020].

But he declined to speculate about the implications. "I don't know if we're proving something different," Sawyer said. "I do agree that we are providing some data that some other organizations might not have."

B. Homeless shelter
Date: 15 Apr 2020
Source: Boston 25 news [edited]
https://www.boston25news.com/news/cdc-reviewing-stunning-universal-testing-results-boston-homeless-shelter/Z253TFBO6RG4HCUAARBO4YWO64/


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now "actively looking into" results from universal COVID-19 testing at Pine Street Inn homeless shelter. The broad-scale testing took place at the shelter in Boston's South End a week and a half ago because of a small cluster of cases there.

Of the 397 people tested, 146 people tested positive. Not a single one had any symptoms. "It was like a double knockout punch. The number of positives was shocking, but the fact that 100 percent of the positives had no symptoms was equally shocking," said Dr Jim O'Connell, president of Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program, which provides medical care at the city's shelters. O'Connell said that the findings have changed the future of COVID-19 screenings at Boston's homeless shelters.

"All the screening we were doing before this was based on whether you had a fever above 100.4 F [38.0 C] and whether you had symptoms," said O'Connell. "How much of the COVID virus is being passed by people who don't even know they have it?" The 146 people who tested positive were immediately moved to 2 different temporary isolation facilities in Boston. According to O'Connell, only 1 of those patients needed hospital care, and many continue to show no symptoms.

"If we did universal testing among the general population, would these numbers be similar?" said Lyndia Downie, president and executive director at the Pine Street Inn. "I think there are [so] many asymptomatic people right now. We just don't know. We don't have enough data on universal testing to understand how many asymptomatic people are contagious."

Hundreds of tests are now set to be conducted at additional Boston homeless shelters in the coming days. "It tells you, you don't know who's at risk. You don't know what you need to do to contain the virus if you don't actually have the details or facts," said Marty Martinez, Boston's chief of Health and Human Services.

About 250 people are expected to be tested on Thursday [16 Apr 2020] and Friday [17 Apr 2020] at the men's Southampton Street shelter run by Boston Public Health Commission. "Our goal within the next 3 or 4 days is to test everybody so we have a good understanding of who has it and who doesn't," added Martinez.

More than 900 isolation beds have been set up locally for people who are homeless. The majority of those beds have not yet been used, but local and state health officials aren't sure if that could change after more testing is complete.

[These 2 articles are not surprising. Studies on "captive populations such as on a naval ship (or cruise ship) permit one to have a finite denominator and permit a closer look at the population statistics. A 60% asymptomatic rate may fully explain how this virus overwhelmed Wuhan China, the north of Italy, and New York State being transmitted under the radarscope, until it managed to infect high risk populations who went on to have severe disease. That being said, one still wonders what proportion of these individuals will go on to develop symptoms.

The asymptomatic positive rate in the homeless shelter is curious and one wonders what proportion of these individuals will ultimately develop symptoms as the population is one where pre-existing comorbidities may be high and untreated.

The Chinese have been collecting data on asymptomatic infections, which they have been sharing on a daily basis for the past week or so, it would be interesting to learn more about the target population for testing when asymptomatic, the rate at which these asymptomatic infected individuals ultimately develop symptoms, and the number of days these individuals are asymptomatic and shedding virus. - Mod.MPP]

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CET, 17 Apr 2020

Highlights
----------
- No new country/territory/area reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.

- Globally, the number of reported confirmed cases exceeded 2 million.

- WHO has released public health guidance for social and religious practices and gatherings during Ramadan. The guidance also offers advice to strengthen mental and physical wellbeing as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. The guidance is available at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/points-of-entry-and-mass-gatherings.

- WHO has released guidance on considerations in adjusting public health and social measures in the context of COVID-19. This document is intended for national authorities and decision makers in countries that have introduced large scale public health and social measures. It offers guidance for adjusting public health and social measures while managing the risk of a resurgence of cases. The guidance is available at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/critical-preparedness-readiness-and-response-actions-for-covid-19.

- The Chinese authorities have informed WHO that as cases have declined in China and the strain on the healthcare system has eased, a multisectoral team was established in late March 2020 to perform a comprehensive review of COVID-19 data in Wuhan, Hubei Province. Information from a variety of sources was reviewed, leading to duplicate cases being removed and missed cases added. Following this review, the total number of cases in Wuhan increased by 325 and the total number of deaths increased by 1290.

- As of 11 Apr 2020, 167 countries, territories and areas have implemented additional health measures that significantly interfere with international traffic. An updated summary is outlined in the 'subject in focus' below.

Subject in focus: additional health measures significantly interfere with international traffic
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As of 11 Apr 2020, 167 countries, territories and areas have implemented additional health measures that significantly interfere with international traffic as defined under Article 43 of the International Health Regulations (2005) (Table 1. Number of States Parties officially reporting additional health measures that significantly interfere with international traffic (that is, more than 24-hour delay), under Article 43 of the IHR (2005), by WHO region -- available at the source URL above)

Since 6 Feb 2020, WHO has shared information regarding additional health measures in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak with Member States every week through the Event Information Site, a secure platform accessible by national IHR focal points and United Nations agencies. The majority of measures taken by Member States relate to the denial of entry of passengers from countries experiencing outbreaks, followed by flight suspensions, visa restrictions, border closures, and quarantine measures. The public health rationale provided by States relates to these measures being part of a comprehensive set of interventions aiming at reducing the spread of the disease, the unknowns about the new virus and the disease, perceived vulnerabilities and concerns about overburdening the public health response capacities, limited capacities to quarantine returning travelers, specificities of small islands states, and the absence of treatment or vaccine.

WHO has held weekly technical coordination meetings with the aviation and tourism sectors. WHO also produces regularly updated guidance and online courses on points of entry and mass gatherings which is available at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/points-of-entry-and-mass-gatherings. The UN International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) published an analysis of the economic impact of COVID-19 on civil aviation yesterday [16 Apr 2020], which is available at https://www.icao.int/sustainability/Documents/COVID-19/ICAO_Coronavirus_Econ_Impact.pdf. Airport Council International has also published a survey of good practices at major airports on operations during COVID-19, available at https://store.aci.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Airport-Operational-Practice-Examples-for-Managing-COVID19.pdf. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has recently published a Quick Reference Guide for Ground Handling during COVID-19, which can be found at https://www.iata.org/contentassets/094560b4bd9844fda520e9058a0fbe2e/quick-reference-guide-ground-handling-covid.pdf

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China is stable at 211. This includes 18 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 60 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 from the Southeast Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 47 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

The Americas region is reporting 36 486 new cases (in the past 24 hours) of which 78.7% were reported by the USA, followed by Brazil at 8.4%, Canada (3.7%), and Peru (3.2%). Recognizing the USA data are overshadowing the regional proportions, without including the reported newly confirmed cases from the USA, Brazil reported 39.3%, followed by Canada at 17.3% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Peru at 15.1%, Chile at 6.9%), and Mexico at 5.8%.

The European region newly confirmed 37 778 (45.5% of the global newly reported cases) new cases and 4163 (49.0%) deaths in the 24 hours since the last WHO update. Spain reported 13.7% of newly confirmed cases, Turkey 12.7%, the UK 12.2%, v Germany 8.9%, and France 6.9%. Russia accounted for 10.8% of the newly confirmed cases, more than Germany and France. Those 6 countries (UK, Spain, Turkey, Italy, Germany, and France, representing 10% of the European countries) account for 64.6% of newly confirmed cases in Europe.

In the Eastern Mediterranean region, Iran reported 1606 new cases representing 36.6% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Pakistan at 11.8%, Saudi Arabia at 11.8%, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) at 10.5%, and Qatar at 8.9%. Removing Iran from the denominator, Pakistan represents 18.7% of newly confirmed cases, followed by Saudi Arabia at 18.6%, UAE at 16.5%, Qatar at 14.1%, and Egypt at 6.0%.

In the African region, there were 16 countries reporting no cases in this 24 hour period. That being said, Algeria reported 20.9% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by South Africa at 19.1%, Cabo Verde at 8.7%, Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire at 6.6% each, Mali at 5.2%, and Niger at 4.8%.

In the Western Pacific region, Singapore reported 43.5% of the newly reported cases (outside of China), Japan reported 35.0%, the Philippines 12.3%, and Malaysia 6.6%. With the revision of the Wuhan totals China represented 17.4% of the total regional newly confirmed cases and 97.8% of the regional newly reported fatalities.

In South East Asia, India reported 56.9% of newly reported cases, followed by Indonesia at 21.5% and Bangladesh at 19.3%. Removing India from the denominator, Indonesia represents 49.8% of the newly reported cases, Bangladesh 44.7%, Thailand 3.7%, and Timor-Leste 1.6%.

Figure 1. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO region through [17 Apr 2020], at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and now the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA but other countries are following suit. The curve dropped over the weekend, although the America's region did not appear to drop.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4).

For the past 4 weeks, I have had help compiling all of the data presented in the tables and preparing spreadsheets, and want to publicly thank Coleman Schaefer for his amazing assistance -- a formidable task to say the least. - Mod.MPP]
