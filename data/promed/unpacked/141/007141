Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) vets are warning farmers about a rise in the incidence of blackleg in cattle after the disease was diagnosed in 5 of its Disease Surveillance Centres (DSC) at St Boswells, Ayr, Dumfries, Edinburgh, and Perth.

These DSCs all serve veterinary practices that are in areas affected by the recent heavy rains and localised flooding. They believe the recent wet weather may have triggered the increase in cases of this fatal disease, caused by the bacterium _Clostridium chauvoei_.

Vet Alwyn Jones, from St Boswells DSC, said: "Cattle between 6 and 24 months old are particularly susceptible to this disease. Affected cattle are often found dead, although occasionally they may be lame and have a swollen upper limb before they die."

Mr Jones said it was not unusual to see outbreaks of blackleg during the warmer months of the year.

The disease can be prevented by vaccination. SAC is advising farmers to investigate the unexpected death of any cattle and consult their vet on vaccinating young stock at pasture.

[Blackleg, also called black quarter, is an acute febrile disease of cattle and sheep caused by _Clostridium chauvoei_ (feseri), characterized by emphysematous swelling, usually in the heavy muscles. It is found worldwide and is not included in OIE's list.

The following information on the disease is extracted from the Merck Veterinary Manual http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/50704.htm&word=blackleg:

Etiology
--------
_C. chauvoei_ is found naturally in the intestinal tract of animals. It probably can remain viable in the soil for many years, although it does not actively grow there. Contaminated pasture appears to be a source of organisms. Outbreaks of blackleg have occurred in cattle on farms in which recent excavations have occurred, which suggests that disturbance of soil may activate latent spores. The organisms probably are ingested, pass through the wall of the GI tract, and after gaining access to the bloodstream, are deposited in muscle and other tissues.

In cattle, blackleg infection is endogenous. Lesions develop without any history of wounds, although bruising or excessive exercise may precipitate some cases. Commonly, the animals that contract blackleg are of the beef breeds, in excellent health, gaining weight, and usually the best animals of their group. Outbreaks occur in which a few new cases are found each day for several days. Most cases are seen in cattle from 6-24 months old, but thrifty calves as young as 6 weeks and cattle as old as 10-12 years may be affected. The disease usually occurs in summer and fall and is uncommon during the winter.

Clinical findings and lesions
-----------------------------
Usually, onset is sudden, and a few cattle may be found dead without premonitory signs. Acute lameness and marked depression are common. Initially, there is a fever but, by the time clinical signs are obvious, body temperature may be normal or subnormal. Characteristic edematous and crepitant swellings develop in the hip, shoulder, chest, back, neck, or elsewhere. At first, the swelling is small, hot, and painful. As the disease rapidly progresses, the swelling enlarges, there is crepitation on palpation, and the skin becomes cold and insensitive as the blood supply to the area diminishes. General signs include prostration and tremors. Death occurs in 12-48 hr. In some cattle, the lesions are restricted to the myocardium and the diaphragm, with no reliable antemortem evidence of the localized lesion.

Diagnosis
---------
A rapidly fatal, febrile disease in well-nourished young cattle, particularly of the beef breeds, with crepitant swellings of the heavy muscles suggests blackleg. The affected muscle is dark red to black and dry and spongy; it has a sweetish odor and is infiltrated with small bubbles but with little edema. The lesions may be in any muscle, even in the tongue or diaphragm. Field diagnoses are confirmed by laboratory demonstration of _C. chauvoei_ in affected muscle. The samples of muscle should be taken as soon after death as possible. The fluorescent antibody test for _C. chauvoei_ is rapid and reliable.

Control
-------
A bacterin containing _C. chauvoei_ and _C. septicum_ is safe and reliable for both cattle and sheep. Calves should be vaccinated twice, 2 weeks apart, at 2-6 months of age; in high-risk areas, revaccination may be necessary at 1 year and every 5 years thereafter. When outbreaks are encountered, all susceptible cattle should be vaccinated and treated prophylactically with penicillin to prevent new cases, which may develop for up to 10 days, at which the bacterin provides protection. In some areas, multicomponent clostridial vaccines are warranted. Treatment of clinical cases with parenteral and multiple local injections of penicillin may be attempted but is frequently unsuccessful. - Mod.AS
