A little-known equine disease is affecting West Berkshire and North
Hampshire this autumn [2011]. The disease, known as atypical myopathy,
has hit the region particularly harshly, with several fatalities
already reported.

Two ponies are known to have died at Hall Place Equestrian Centre in
Sulham Hill, and several owners in West Berkshire have reported, via
on online equine chatrooms, that their own animals have been
stricken.

Partner at Newbury vets O'Gorman Slater Alastair Welch said: "It's
worth getting the message out that we seem to have an outbreak in this
region. It's thought to be caused by clostridium bacteria in soil or
pasture that is ingested. It seems the current weather conditions have
caused the bacteria to multiply more than usual. Although I've
personally heard of 6 or 7 cases locally this year [2011], last year
was particularly bad, with around a dozen cases."

Symptoms include lethargy, tight muscles, difficulty breathing,
distended nostrils and raised pulse rate, and risk factors include
cold, damp, frost-free weather and pastures with poor natural drainage
and vegetation of low nutritional value.

In its early stages, the condition can be confused with colic or
laminitis, and affected animals can deteriorate rapidly if not
treated.

Mr Welch advised: "It would be sensible, if at all possible, for
owners to remove animals from pasture and keep them stabled and fed
hay. If this isn't practical, then try to feed hay from a height or
from a bucket instead of scattering it on the ground."

[Earlier this year (2011), researchers in Switzerland suggested that
_Clostridium sordellii_ toxins could be suspected as the possible
cause of equine atypical myopathy (EAM). Final evidence is still
awaited; see ProMED mail post 20110410.1139. - Mod.AS]
