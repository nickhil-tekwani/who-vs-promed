[2] Indonesia (Java, Sulawesi): suspected
Date: Tue 23 Jan 2007

Two suspected avian influenza patients have been admitted to Kariadi
Hospital in Semarang, Central Java, and another one to Wahidin
Sudirohusodo Hospital in Makassar, South Sulawesi.
The 2 and man 51, and a woman, 26 -- have been treated in the
hospital's intensive care unit since Sun 21 Jan 2007, after coming
down with symptoms similar to those of bird flu.
Their daughter said on Monday that her father had suffered from high
fever with respiratory difficulties since 18 Jan.
"Due to the illness in his throat, he could not speak. I wasn't sure
whether his disease had something to do with bird flu. We just got
scared after we found out many fowls in our village had died suddenly
for unclear reasons," the daughter said. "Because of our fear we
brought our father here on Sunday. The hospital still has not given
us any information about the cause of my father's illness," she said.
She added that her neighbors raised a lot of poultry in their backyards.
The ill woman's father said his daughter complained of breathing
problems and coughing. He believed his daughter was infected with
bird flu because several days before she fell ill, many birds kept by
their neighbors died suddenly.
The 2 raised the number of suspected bird flu patients in Central
Java in 2007 to 4. One patient died in the 1st week of January. She
was identified as a resident of Blerong village in Guntur district,
Demak regency. After her death, authorities carried out a mass cull
of fowls raised by residents in her village.
The Makassar patient is a 22-month-old baby. She was admitted to the
hospital Saturday with a high fever and difficulty breathing. The
baby's mother said her daughter had been ill for a week. As her
temperature remained high, her mother brought her to the hospital to
get better medical treatment. "Instead of falling, her temperature
rose on the 4th day of her illness. I was worried she was infected
with the bird flu virus because she was used to playing with the
neighbors' fowls, some of which had died suddenly," the woman said.
She explained that her daughter's condition had improved
significantly, but the hospital had not yet determined her diagnosis
because her blood samples were still being analyzed at the laboratory.
The local administration has urged residents of South Sulawesi to be
alert for the possible spread of bird flu because the province is
classified as one of the 9 regions in the country where the virus is
endemic. During 2006 at least 25 suspected bird flu patients were
admitted to the same hospital in Makassar.
Meanwhile, West Java has not yet begun mass culls, which are already
underway in Jakarta. Nana M. Adnan of the West Java Livestock
Husbandry Office said officials were awaiting a decree from the
governor. Nearly 33 million chickens are raised in backyards
throughout the province. "We cannot do anything because the
gubernatorial decree is still being worked out," Nana said in Bandung
on Monday.
The number of suspected bird flu patients being treated at the Hasan
Sadikin Hospital in Bandung fell to 4 as of Monday. One patient, a
woman from Garut, died Friday.

[These additional suspected, as yet unconfirmed, human cases of avian
influenza (2 located in Central Java and one in South Sulawesi) are
being reported because sporadic cases are being confirmed regularly
from different regions of Indonesia. In contrast, there have been
several reports of suspected human cases in Thailand where there has
been a resurgence of disease in poultry. These suspected cases have
not been reported because so far none of the Thai cases have been
confirmed. - Mod.CP]
