Angola: Marburg hemorrhagic fever death toll reaches 150
-----------------------------------------------
The outbreak of [Marburg hemorrhagic fever] has intensified in Angola,
claiming more than 20 lives over the past 3 days [1-3 Apr 2005], taking the
nationwide toll to 150. "In total, we have registered 163 cases, of whom
150 have died," Angola's Vice Health Minister Jose Van-Dunem told reporters
on Sun 3 Apr 2005. The official toll had stood at 130 on Friday [1 Apr
2005]. The Marburg outbreak has claimed a record number of lives in Angola,
overtaking an earlier peak in the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo.
"A 4th person has died in Luanda, but all 4 came from the province of
Uige," which is the epicenter of the outbreak, about 300 km north of the
coastal capital. A combined statement by the World Health Organization and
the Angolan government, meanwhile, said 80 percent of the cases involved
children under 15.
Causing a severe hemorrhagic fever similar to Ebola, Marburg virus spreads
through contact with bodily fluids, such as blood, urine, excrement, vomit
and saliva. The disease was 1st identified in 1967 in Germany, after
laboratory workers were infected by monkeys from Uganda.
