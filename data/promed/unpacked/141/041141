At least 2 patients in New Jersey have contracted _Burkholderia cepacia_ bloodstream infections related to a multistate outbreak that may be associated with pre-filled saline flushes, the state Department of Health announced Tue [4 Oct 2016]. The department is investigating the outbreak, along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the NJ Board of Pharmacy and other state departments.

Pennsylvania and Maryland's health departments alerted state officials to clusters of infections among patients in long-term care facilities who receive medication through a central [intravenous] line. The infections may stem from using pre-filled saline flushes from Nurse Assist, a Texas-based company.

All long-term care facilities that receive the product were notified on 30 Sep [2016] and told to discontinue using them until further notice, the department said. "However, since this is a rapidly evolving situation, not all distribution networks have been identified, and it is unclear at this time that all the affected products have been identified," the department warned.

Long-term facilities are asked to report suspected illnesses to the state.

_B. cepacia_ complex is a group of related lactose-non fermenting, Gram negative bacterial species, some of which are capable of causing life-threatening respiratory tract infections in immunocompromised patients or patients with chronic lung diseases, particularly cystic fibrosis https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16217180).

_B. cepacia_ is a water/soil organism that was formerly classified as _Pseudomonas cepacia_. _B. cepacia_ survives and multiplies in aqueous hospital environments and can contaminate certain antiseptic solutions such as quaternary ammonium salts, chlorhexidine, and iodine products. _B. cepacia_ are often resistant to common antibiotics. - Mod.ML
