In the municipality of Utrecht, 2 dead wild geese were found to be infected by HPAI H5N5. This avian influenza variant may originate from a combination of the H5N8-type virus (which circulated in Europe last month [April 2017]) with a different, low pathogenic type. This H5N5 variant has been found more frequently in wild birds over the past few years.

The risk of contamination has recently decreased so that almost all rural measures could be withdrawn as of [Wed 19 Apr 2017]. Although the risk has decreased, the virus is not completely gone. Thus, infected wild birds can be found. Alert among poultry holders is thus suggested. This includes the continued maintenance of good hygiene on the plant.
