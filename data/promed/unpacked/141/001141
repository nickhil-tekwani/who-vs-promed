[With the addition of these 6 newly confirmed cases, there have now been a total of 1147 cases of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection including 487 deaths reported in Saudi Arabia since June 2012. With respect to the ongoing transmission of MERS-CoV in Riyadh, since the beginning of August 2015 there have been a total 87 newly confirmed cases and 19 fatalities reported. Information is not available to determine how many of these 87 newly confirmed cases in Riyadh are associated with the outbreak in the National Guard hospital vs. elsewhere in Riyadh.

The Saudi Arabia Ministry of Health today [23 Aug 2015] conducted the 1st of a series of detailed background briefings designed to provide specific and up-to-date information regarding MERS-CoV as part of its commitment to transparency and cooperation. Today's briefing was focused on the recent outbreak in Riyadh's National Guard hospital and the related containment actions to date.

The Ministry detailed both the specific actions taken to address the MERS-CoV cluster at the National Guard hospital, as well as actions taken to prevent flare-ups in other areas.

This outbreak tested several of the new procedures put in place recently by the Ministry to respond to such outbreaks, and those systems have worked extremely well to date in containing the situation.

53 cases have been traced to the National Guard hospital infection. Of those, 32 patients remain hospitalized, 3 are in at-home isolation, there have been 17 deaths, and 1 patient has already been discharged. More than 5700 samples have been screened as part the tracking and tracing activity to monitor all potentially affected persons.

There were 7 new cases confirmed yesterday [22 Aug 2015]. All of these patients are in stable condition.

Specific steps taken to respond to the outbreak include:
- Rapid Response team sent to National Guard hospital immediately after the infections were identified as a MERS-CoV outbreak. This team comprises leading experts in infectious disease who support the local medical teams in effective containment procedures.
- Field Epidemiology team deployed to the site to support on-site analysis and transmission specifics.
- Public Health Team is on site supporting comprehensive tracking, tracing and testing of all persons in the contact circle of suspected and at-risk cases. The Ministry has sampled and tested more than 5700 samples to support early identification among all at-risk individuals and give them the "all clear" when they are identified as having no infection.

In addition, the Ministry worked with the National Guard staff to streamline the facilities to better address the MERS-CoV issue specifically by deferring all elective admissions and procedures.

The Ministry of Health also detailed steps taken to bolster the preparedness of medical facilities across the country to prevent another outbreak, including:

- Deployed Infectious Disease Specialist teams to all Riyadh hospitals. This is meant to increase coverage surrounding the infection area and ensure our facilities are running all necessary safety protocols. The Minister of Health personally met with the directors of all Riyadh hospitals to lead the coordination.

- Established an open network connecting the medical teams throughout our national hospital network. This enables them to be fully connected in real time and able to monitor, communicate and learn from their colleagues about MERS-CoV activity.

Collectively, these containment steps have been highly effective. MERS-CoV is a tricky disease. It can crop up in unlikely places; but these rapid-response capabilities, built in coordination with global health partners such as the WHO, are essential tools in helping us to meet this challenge.

Responsibility for stopping the spread of MERS-CoV doesn't end with healthcare workers. It is a responsibility shared by everyone -- to be aware and informed about the very basic preventative hygiene steps that can stop the spread of infection and save a life:
- Wash your hands with warm soapy water for 30 seconds
- Cough into your arm
- and limit visitors to sick family members in the hospital.

Statistics and news regarding MERS-CoV are updated daily on the Ministry of Health website, <www.moh.gov.sa> and the latest prevention information can be accessed at <www.wecanstopthis.com>, where you can donate your own personal Twitter feed to broadcast MERS health bulletins to your circle of friends and loved ones.

[3] Saudi Arabia, Hajj preventive measures - media report
Date: 24 Aug 2015

The Ministry of Health has taken all necessary measures to control the rising incidence of MERS in Riyadh, and a 24X7 epidemiological surveillance system is in place in Makkah and Madinah.

This information was given to reporters here on Sunday [23 Aug 2015] by Deputy Health Minister Abdulaziz bin Saeed and Assistant Deputy Minister for Preventive Health Abdullah M. Asiri.

"This is the 4th Haj without any Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus case," Asiri said.

The ministers were addressing a press conference on the action taken to address the MERS-CoV cluster at the National Guard hospital, as well as steps taken to prevent flare-ups in other areas of Riyadh.

Abdulaziz said the ministry has deployed infectious disease specialist teams at all hospitals in the capital to monitor the movement of the virus. When the National Guard hospital reported high incidence of the disease, a rapid response team of experts in infectious diseases was sent there to support the local teams in effective containment procedures, he said.

"The ministry has tested over 5700 samples for early detection to give an all-clear certificate to individuals who tested negative for MERS."
Asked about the safety measures during the forthcoming Haj period, Asiri told Arab News that 3 laboratories have been set up in Makkah, Mina and Arafat, while 4 such facilities in Madinah.

"The test results of suspected samples will be given within 8 hours. In the event of any positive cases, the authorities will isolate such patients and bring them out of the sacred areas to prevent the spread of the disease among other pilgrims," he added.

Some 53 cases have been traced to the National Guard hospital infection. Of those, 32 patients remain hospitalized, 3 are in at-home isolation, 17 died, and 1 patient has been discharged. More than 5700 samples have been screened as part the tracking and tracing activity to monitor all potentially affected persons.

There were 7 new cases confirmed on Saturday, bringing the total to 1141 cases since June 2012.

[Among the challenging aspects of the MERS-CoV surveillance during the Hajj is the 14-day incubation period, and the possibility of infected individuals returning to their home countries where MERS-CoV surveillance may be sub-optimal.

The 8-hour turnaround time for processing specimens for MERS-CoV confirmation is commendable. Some questions come to mind here. There is mention of isolating individuals if they test positive for MERS-CoV, but will there be isolation facilities for those pending laboratory confirmation? Based on reports from previous Hajj pilgrimages, there is a fairly high incidence of febrile respiratory illnesses in Hajj attendees. Up through the present, where results were available there have not been any documented cases of MERS-CoV infection among Hajj attendees. Will there be sufficient resources to test all individuals presenting with febrile respiratory illnesses? And what about those individuals who do not seek medical care? - Mod.MPP
