A total of 40 workers in a confectionery factory in Perm have suffered
poisoning after having lunch in the canteen. 3 of them are being treated in
the intensive care unit due to their severe condition. Rospotrebnadzor
[Federal Service for Consumer Affairs and Human Welfare] specialists have
found sodium nitrite on the plates and in the table salt at the canteen.
Criminal charges are being pursued according to the regulations for such
incidents.

[Sodium nitrate has on a number of occasions been mistaken for table salt.
Clinical signs of ingestion may include gastroenteritis, abdominal pains,
dizziness, bloody diarrhea, convulsions, and collapse. Purging and diuresis
are expected. If the victim receives small, repeated doses there may be
headache and mental impairment. Generally in the case of mistaking sodium
nitrate for sodium chloride, the dose may be larger for large meals typical
of celebrations. Rare cases of nitrates being converted to the more toxic
nitrites have been reported.

Sodium nitrate has been used in curing meat for centuries. Bacterial action
converts the nitrate to nitrite, which kills the organism responsible for
botulism poisoning. Generally sodium nitrite has replaced sodium nitrate,
except in slow-cured hams.

Nitrite is added to certain foods to prevent the growth of the
spore-forming bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_, whose toxin causes
botulism, leading to paralysis and, potentially, death. The word botulinum
comes from the Latin word botulus, meaning sausage, which was responsible
for many deaths centuries ago before curing with nitrite was used. In
addition to serving as an antimicrobial, nitrite is used to produce the
characteristic flavor, texture, and pink color of cured meats.

At significant blood levels, the nitrite's oxidation of the iron in
hemoglobin from the ferrous to the ferric state yields methemoglobin, which
does not carry oxygen and imparts a brown hue to the blood. Symptoms of
methemoglobinemia include headaches, fatigue, tachycardia (fast heart
rate), weakness, and dizziness. As oxygenation of tissues decreases to the
point of becoming truly inadequate, dyspnea (shortness of breath),
acidosis, arrhythmias (irregular heart rhythms), coma, convulsions, and
even death may occur. - Mod.TG
