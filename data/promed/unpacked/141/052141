The Department of Health (DOH) on Tuesday [3 Jan 2023] said no additional human cases of anthrax were recorded in the province of Cagayan, declaring that the health event has been tagged as "controlled." The DOH also reported that no additional deaths due to anthrax among carabaos were logged as of 3 Jan 2023.

"According to the latest reports from the DOH Epidemiology Bureau (EB) and the Regional Epidemiology Surveillance Unit (RESU) of Region II, there has been no additional human cases of anthrax recorded and no additional deaths among carabaos as of 3 Jan 2023," the DOH said. "The health event has now been tagged as controlled," it added.

The DOH earlier said there were 12 suspect cases reported as of 22 Dec 2022 and 3 tested positive for _Bacillus anthracis_ via PCR. [Human cases] monitored by the regional health units as of 22 Dec 2022 have all been tagged as recovered.

Regional units of both the DOH and the Department of Agriculture reported a number of carabaos, which got sick and died after exhibiting symptoms of anthrax. Individuals have also been reported to have consumed meat of the sick carabaos.

The health department said anthrax is a bacteria commonly found in soil. "It is also a zoonotic disease that is transmitted from animal to human usually via direct skin contact or consumption of contaminated food or drink. You can also be infected through inhalation of its spores," the DOH said.

According to Mark Salazar's "24 Oras" report on Tuesday [3 Jan 2023], the Bureau of Animal Industry said the mortality rate of anthrax among animals is at least 90%, after they eat grass from the soil with anthrax bacteria. "It is endemic only in Region 1 and 2 so that's normal because they have Cagayan River, flooding, anthrax spores spread," Dr. Myrna Baldecañas, head of Bacterial Veterinary Biologics Laboratory Production, BAI-DA, said. The BAI said it is still studying and monitoring the presence of anthrax bacteria in the said regions.

"The BAI is doing the anthrax vaccine to prevent the disease and infection [in livestock]. We have a target of 15 000 doses which is enough for their needs and requirements [in] Region 2," said Baldecañas. The Department of Agriculture Region 2 said at least 2 areas in Cagayan were under quarantine as part of the biosecurity protocol despite the absence of additional cases of the disease. The BAI said they are strictly monitoring the area to prevent the spread of the disease like the African swine fever (ASF) in other areas.

The earlier report had 4 Carabao bull deaths, and 73 people exposed and 22 with cutaneous lesions. And the regional medics and veterinary services have done an excellent job getting it all under control, as well as livestock vaccination initiated. - Mod.MHJ
