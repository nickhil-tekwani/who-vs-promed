Emergence of a novel cluster of influenza A(H5N1) virus clade 2.2.1.2 with putative human health impact in Egypt, 2014/15
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
A distinct cluster of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of subtype A(H5N1) has been found to emerge within clade 2.2.1.2 in poultry in Egypt since summer 2014 and appears to have quickly become predominant. Viruses of this cluster may be associated with increased incidence of human influenza A(H5N1) infections in Egypt over the last months.

In Egypt, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) influenza A(H5N1) viruses of clade 2.2.1 and their descendants have been circulating in poultry populations since 2006, causing sporadic human infections [1]. Human influenza A(H5N1) infections in Egypt have been reported since the introduction of the virus in 2006 with â€‰204 cases occurring until end of 2014 and a fatality rate of 35.8 percent in laboratory-confirmed cases reported to the World Health Organization (WHO). However, since January 2015, the incidence of human H5N1 cases in Egypt has increased dramatically: as of 21 March 2015, 116 human cases including 36 deaths have been reported to WHO [2]. This study was initiated to analyse molecular properties of H5N1 viruses that have caused outbreaks in poultry in Egypt since summer 2014 and to compare them with published sequences from H5N1 viruses obtained from recent human cases. ...

According to FluTrackers, the current tally of human H5N1 cases in Egypt is 128 (https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/china-h7n9-outbreak-tracking/143874-flutrackers-2013-15-human-case-list-of-provincial-ministry-of-health-government-confirmed-influenza-a-h7n9-cases-with-links), a number greater than the 116 quoted above by WHO. In addition, there have been heavy losses in poultry due to high infection rates. 435 outbreaks of H5N1 infections in poultry in Egypt are noted in this paper between October 2014 and February 2015, as reported to the National Laboratory for Quality Control on Poultry Production (NLQP) by Egyptian veterinary authorities. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that this increased level of transmission in the birds in Egypt (which includes chickens, ducks, turkeys and quail) has led to increased exposure of bird handlers and buyers and backyard bird owners, and consequently increased numbers of cases. However, another possibility proposed by this paper is that the genetic changes observed in the 2015 viruses have led to greater transmissibility of the virus. The investigators found that strains analyzed since November 2014 contain distinct fixed mutations in several genome segments PB2, PB1-F2, HA, NA, M1. The emerging cluster identified in this study seems to be predominant across all poultry production sectors and has already caused 1/3rd of all human H5N1 infections reported in Egypt since 2006, in only 3 months of 2015.

But questions remain -- what are the molecular determinants that increase fitness of these viruses? What are the selective pressures acting on the virus? Are the observed genetic changes random, or is natural selection acting to favor mutations that make the virus more transmissible? Studies of the pathogenicity and transmissibility of these viruses, most likely using the ferret model, need to be conducted to answer the question of whether the genetic changes are affecting the current outbreak.
