As of Wed 20 Nov 2002 the Ministry of Health has confirmed 57 cases and 10

The outbreak has affected: - Touba, Mbacke, and Bambey districts, Diourbel

Mousty and Kebemer districts, Louga region - Khombole and Thiadiaye
districts, Thies region - Tambacounda district in Tambacounda region - and
Dakar Centre district, Dakar region.
New confirmed cases have been detected in Louga and Thies region.
Preliminary laboratory testing suggest that one case has occurred in Dakar
and is being investigated further.
A total of 33 cases were reported from Touba, where urban transmission was
occurring. The immunization campaigns in Diourbel region have achieved
coverage rates of 94-99 percent (Touba = 99 percent), and no cases have
been confirmed in this region since 24 Oct 2002. The date of onset of
illness for the 2 most recent confirmed cases was 11 Nov 2002 and 9 Nov

surveillance in all districts in the country, including active surveillance
in Dakar is continuing.
Laboratory testing is being performed by the WHO Collaborating Centre at
the Institut Pasteur in Dakar (IPD). The Institut de Recherche pour le
Developpement (IRD), the University Cheikh Anta Diop of Dakar and IPD are
carrying out entomological investigations. IPD, IRD and WHO have been
assisting the Ministry of Health with surveillance, epidemiological and
entomological investigations. An immunization campaign has begun in Gossas
and Fatick districts, and one is planned for Tambacounda, Khombole,
Guingineo, Kebemer, and Darou Mousty districts. WHO is supporting the
immunization campaigns with both technical assistance and vaccine supplies.
In response to an appeal for financial support for the outbreak response,
WHO wishes to acknowledge the support of the Government of Norway, the
Government of Belgium, the UNFPA, and the Gates Foundation.
