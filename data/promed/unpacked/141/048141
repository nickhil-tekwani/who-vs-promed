Medical investigators are looking into the death of a Florida meat
warehouse laborer who died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. The Miami man died
March 5 of the degenerative disease, a rare affliction that affects just
one in one million people, officials said. The man was not a victim of the
variant strain of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) linked by British
researchers to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), officials said.
Dr. Eleni Sfakianaki, medical executive director of the Dade County Health
Department said the variant type of CJD has not appeared in the United
States. "This is a typical, regular CJ disease," she said. "It is a very
rare disease, the incidence is about one in one million people. "There is
no reason for people to panic, no reason to be alarmed at all."
In a March 6 statement, the Dade County Medical Examiner's Office said:
"The relationship of this condition to the deceased's occupation, a meat
warehouse laborer, is under investigation and remains to be determined."
"The clinical course (progression of the disease) doesn't fit the variant
disease that was described in England," according to Dr. Bruce Hyma, a
Miami-Dade County associate medical examiner. "His clinical course
indicates CJD." Dade County authorities launched an investigation in part
to quell perceptions of a public health threat and partly because the man
worked in a meat warehouse, Hyma said. "It brings up the question -- is
there a relationship? From all the information I've seen so far, he would
be a sporadic case of CJD. He just happened to have that occupation," he
said.
Brain tissue samples were being sent to Case Western University in
Cleveland, Ohio, for examination by experts in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been notified.
