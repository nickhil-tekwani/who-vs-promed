9 people have died due to eating maize contaminated with aflatoxin in
Makueni District. In June 2004, over 121 people died in Makueni District
due to the same cause. The Ministry of Health has sent a team with CDC
experts to control the outbreak.

[Aflatoxin is a naturally occurring mycotoxin produced by 2 types of mold:
_Aspergillus flavus_ and _Aspergillus parasiticus_. _A. flavus_ is common
and widespread in nature and is most often found when certain grains are
grown under stressful conditions such as drought. The mold occurs in soil,
decaying vegetation, hay, and grains undergoing microbiological
deterioration and invades all types of organic substrates whenever and
wherever the conditions are favorable for its growth. Favorable conditions
include high moisture content and high temperature. At least 13 different
types of aflatoxin are produced in nature, with aflatoxin B1 considered the
most toxic. While the presence of _A. flavus_ does not always indicate
harmful levels of aflatoxin, it does mean that the potential for aflatoxin
production is present
(source:<http://www.usda.gov/gipsa/newsroom/backgrounders/b-aflatox.htm>).
Aflatoxins are acutely toxic and have been shown to be carcinogenic for
humans. Animals are susceptible to acute death and liver damage when
exposed to high doses, but seldom develop cancer following long term
low-level exposure. The toxicity varies between different species, but data
from a large outbreak of poisoning in India in 1974, which involved moldy
maize and in which nearly 100 people died, suggests that the toxicity of
aflatoxin B1 for humans lies somewhere between that for the dog and that
for the rat. The involvement of aflatoxins with human cancer is more
complex and remains to be defined
(source:<http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/capacity/en/2.pdf>).
Considering the number of deaths here, it would seem this is an acute
poisoning with a high dose. - Mod.TG]
