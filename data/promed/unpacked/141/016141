problem is anthrax.
The southwest reporting its 1st case of anthrax. Dr. Sandra Stephens
is the regional veterinarian with the Canadian Food Inspection
Agency. "The producer had reported some mortalities to his local
veterinarians and they had submitted samples to the Prairie
Diagnostic Labs in Saskatoon and so this time we have 3 confirmed

quarantine and the remaining animals will be treated with an
antibiotic and then vaccinated.
