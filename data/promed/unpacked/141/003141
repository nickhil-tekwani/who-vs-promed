For the third time this month, a New Jersey food company is recalling
exotic foods, mostly French delicacies, because they may be contaminated
with a bacterium that can cause an uncommon but potentially fatal illness.
Tests revealed that 26 additional products from D'Artagnan Inc. of Newark,
N.J., may contain _Listeria monocytogenes_, which can cause listeriosis,
the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
The latest recall applies to all varieties and sizes of Terrine of Foie
Gras Natural, Terrine of Foie Gras Sauternes, Terrine of Goose Foie Gras,
Mousse of Foie Gras, Mousse of Foie Gras with Truffles, French Kisses --
Prunes with Foie Gras, Duck Galantine, Indian Summer Pate, Mousse
Basquaise, Mousse Basquaise -- slice, Mousse Truffee, Mouse Peppercorn and
Quail Terrine Bacchus.
The recall also includes Rillettes, Terrine Chicken Du Soleil, Terrine
Mousquetaire, Terrine Pheasant Herbette, Vegetable Terrine, Venison Terrine
En Croute, Smoked Magret Duck Breast Half, Smoked Magret Duck Breast
Quarter, Smoked Duck Wings -- 4/Pack, Pastrami of Smoked Duck Breast, Duck
Leg Confit, Gizzards Confit and Truffle Butter.
All the products have the number "P9678" or "EST9678" inside the USDA seal
of inspection.
Earlier this month D'Artagnan recalled 8-ounce packages of Pork Free Mousse
Truffee and Pork Free Peppercorn Mousse when tests showed the products may
contain _Listeria monocytogenes_.
The government said consumers who purchased any of the recalled D'Artagnan
products should return them to the store where they were purchased. Anyone
concerned about illness should contact a doctor immediately.
For more information consumers can call USDA's meat and poultry hot line at
1-800-535-4555. The hot line is staffed from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. EST Monday
through Friday.
