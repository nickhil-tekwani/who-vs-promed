Lumpy skin disease: vaccination is most effective control method
----------------------------------------------------------------
Vaccination of cattle is the most effective option for controlling the spread of lumpy skin disease, European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) experts say. This is one of the main findings of a scientific statement on the effectiveness of different options for controlling the spread of this economically damaging disease. The work was requested by the European Commission following the rapid spread of the disease in Greece and Bulgaria and other Balkan countries.

Lumpy skin disease is a viral disease that affects cattle and is transmitted by blood-feeding insects, such as certain species of flies and mosquitoes, or ticks.

EFSA experts say that when vaccination is thoroughly applied, partial culling of affected animals is as effective in eradicating the disease as whole-herd culling, which is currently required under EU legislation. In particular, vaccination is most effective if applied before the virus enters a region or a country. Experts recommend that vaccination is applied uniformly across all areas.

EFSA used a mathematical model for simulating the spread of the disease according to different control measures. Lumpy skin disease is present in many African countries. Since 2012, it has been spreading from the Middle East to south east Europe. The risk of further spread of the disease is high.

[The full EFSA document, "Urgent advice on lumpy skin disease, by EFSA's Panel on Animal Health and Welfare" has been published in EFSA's Journal 2016;14(8):4573, at http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/4573.

We present 2 sections from the document: 1. the abstract and 2. article 3.1 "vaccines available" (for the omitted references, please refer to the full document at the source URL).

1. Abstract
-----------
"In order to assess the effects on disease spread and persistence of partial stamping out of only clinically affected animals in holdings where the presence of lumpy skin disease has been confirmed, against total stamping-out policy of infected herds coupled with vaccination, a mathematical model for the transmission of LSDV [lumpy skin disease virus] between farms was developed and different scenarios explored. According to the model, vaccination has a greater impact in reducing LSDV spread than any culling policy, even when low vaccination effectiveness is considered. When vaccination is evenly applied so that 95 per cent of the farms are vaccinated with 75 per cent of vaccinated animals effectively protected, then total stamping out and partial stamping out result in a similar probability of eradicating the infection. When no vaccination is applied or when vaccination has a lower effectiveness (for example, 40 per cent), the probability of eradication is higher when total stamping out is performed as compared to partial stamping out. In general, partial stamping out results in limited increase of the number of farms affected as compared to total stamping out. Independently of the culling interventions applied in the model, vaccination was most effective in reducing LSDV spread if protection had already been developed at the time of virus entry, followed by protection of herds after virus entry. No vaccination is the least effective option in reducing LSDV spread. In order to reach the above described effects, it is necessary to implement vaccination of the entire susceptible population in regions at risk for LSDV introduction or affected by LSDV in order to minimise the number of outbreaks, and high animal- and farm-level vaccination coverage should be achieved. Farmers and veterinarians should be trained in the clinical identification of LSD [lumpy skin disease] in order to reduce underreporting, and the effectiveness of partial stamping out should be evaluated."

2. 3.1 Immune response and vaccines against LSD
-----------------------------------------------
"Since vaccination is part of the eradication strategy, the main characteristics of the immune response and vaccination against LSD are reported below.

"Immunity to capripoxvirus infections is predominantly cell mediated and requires a replicating agent to be effectively stimulated. Animals that have recovered from apparent or inapparent natural infection with LSDV develop antibodies capable of neutralising up to 3 logs of the virus, and are also resistant to reinfection. Animals that have been vaccinated or showed mild disease develop low levels of neutralising antibodies. Serological assays are not capable of distinguishing between neutralising antibodies of vaccination and infection origins.

"Only live attenuated vaccines against LSD are currently commercially available, such as the attenuated Neethling strain (LSDV) vaccine. General requirements for LSDV vaccines are described in the European Pharmacopoeia and in the OIE Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines (OIE, 2014). It is widely agreed that vaccination using a homologous vaccine is the only effective way to control the spread of LSDV in endemic countries. In some contexts, the sheep pox/goat pox vaccine was used for cattle but cross-protection is poor. Neutralising antibodies to LSDV persist for at least 2-3 years after vaccination. Antibodies appear 10 days after vaccination and reach the highest level 30 days post inoculation. Calves born to immunised cows will have passive immunity that persists for about 6 months.

"Currently, there are no inactivated or DIVA [Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals] vaccines of any kind (or associated tests) commercially available.

"Literature review revealed only one randomised field study and 2 challenge studies on LSDV vaccines. The randomised field study, conducted on 5000 cows in 15 dairy herds in Israel, compared an LSDV attenuated Neethling strain vaccine and a sheep pox attenuated RM-65 vaccine administered at 10 times the dose administered to sheep, both administered at 103.5 TCID. The Neethling vaccine was 4.3 times more effective in preventing laboratory-diagnosed LSD than the 10x M-65 vaccine, and 11.2 times more effective in preventing severe LSD cases. This vaccine, however, caused adverse effects in 0.5 percent of the vaccinated cows, which was characterised by a very mild and transient LSD-like disease. A challenge study performed recently in Ethiopia showed that an attenuated Gorgon strain GTPV vaccine is effective in preventing LSD after challenge" [see at http://www.researchgate.net/publication/278022728].

The change of EU LSD policy of stamping out without vaccination into preventive vaccination policy in yet unaffected countries is long due. It remains to be hoped that a validated inactivated DIVA LSD vaccine becomes available sooner than later.
