other reports

A major wire service today provided information on an outbreak of H5N1 in
poultry that was originally published in the Hong Kong Standard on 22
August of this year.
There was an outbreak of the virus in chickens in Guangdong province (whose
capital is Guangzhou) in February and March, killing approximately 1.7
million birds. This information was not carried on the Office
International des Epizooties reports. China is not a member of the OIE.
However, Hong Kong [prior to its return as a province of China in
mid-summer was an OIE member. For 1996 no highly pathogenic avian
influenza was reported by Hong Kong to the OIE.
In April, there was an outbreak, according to the newspaper, killing 4500
chickens on 3 farms in Lau Fau Shan, Hong Kong province. According to
official statements of the Agriculture and Fisheries Department (AFD) in
late August, the virus was believed to have burned itself out, because
there were no further reports from farmers. After the first human case of
H5N1, the department's Castle Peak laboratory took 80 blood samples from 5
farms to test for viral activity. Laboratory results, supposed to be ready
within 4 weeks (i.e., late Sept.), were not made public.
Annual chicken production in the province is about 17,950 tonnes from 150
farms. The 1996 consumption of chicken in the province was 69,250 tonnes.
The balance between local production and consumption is filled by imports
from the mainland.
Simultaneously with the stepped up inspection of Hong Kong producers, the
AFD began demanding health certificates for all poultry brought across
provincial borders. Previously, a visual check on the clinical health of
the imports had been deemed sufficient. [Highly pathogenic strains of AI is
a severe, devastating disease, usually killing many birds quickly. - Mod.PC

>From another media source of today (10 December), Macao Daily News, experts
have warned Macao residents to be careful in contacts with birds, cook food
thoroughly, tend to personal and environmental hygiene, but not panic. The
residents of Macao have been told that their imported poultry comes mainly
from Zhuhai, Zhongshan and Jiangmen cities, whereas Hong Kong's imports are
mainly from Shenzhen which is in Guandong province.

[It is important to note that approximately 30% of the poultry sold in
China for consumption is sold "on the foot" and is not pre-slaughtered.
The poultry are sold in crowded markets where a great deal of mixing of
people and birds occur. While it is good to have better health
certification, the most important information is incidence data over time
and geography for poultry in Guangdong province since last February in
order to assess the need for quarantine. Of course, human to human
transmission is the most significant question now that the thin line
between animal and human disease has been crossed. - Mods.DP/PC
