REGULATED PLANT PESTS, DETECTION, MAY 2001: EPPO
-------------------------------------------------
The EPPO Secretariat has gathered the notifications of non-compliance (as
they are now called by FAO ISPM no. 13) for 2001 received since the
previous report (EPPO RS 2001/079) from the following countries: Algeria,
Austria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany,
Ireland, Israel, Lithuania, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia,
Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom. When a consignment has been
re-exported and the country of origin is unknown, the re-exporting country
is indicated in brackets. When the occurrence of a pest in a given country
is not known to the EPPO Secretariat, this is indicated by an asterisk (*).
The EPPO Secretariat has selected notifications of non-compliance made
because of the detection of regulated pests. Other notifications of
non-compliance due to prohibited commodities, missing or invalid
certificates are not indicated. It must be pointed out that the report is
only partial, as many EPPO countries have not yet sent their notifications.
The EPPO Secretariat has gathered the notifications of non-compliance (as
they are now called by FAO draft ISPM) received since the previous report
(EPPO RS 2000/186) for:
1) 2000 from the following countries: Algeria, Austria, Cyprus, Croatia,
Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Israel,
Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Sweden,
Switzerland, United Kingdom.
2) 2001 from the following countries: Denmark, Finland, France, Ireland,
Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom. When a
consignment has been re-exported and the country of origin is unknown, the
re-exporting country is indicated in brackets. When the occurrence of a
pest in a given country is not known to the EPPO Secretariat, this is
indicated by an asterisk (*).
The EPPO Secretariat has selected notifications of non-compliance made
because of the detection of regulated pests. Other notifications of
non-compliance due to prohibited commodities, missing or invalid
certificates are not indicated. It must be pointed out that the report is
only partial, as many EPPO countries have not yet sent their notifications.
Note:
-----
Interceptions should NOT be interpreted as confirmed presence of a pest in
a country. Errors or even falsifications may occur (the origin of the
consignment may be incorrect, pest misidentified, etc.). EPPO publishes
reports on these notifications of non-compliance because they are an
indication of the practical problems that are encountered in Europe. They
can give useful indications and help countries to identify pathways (type
of commodity + origin) which may present a risk. Some interceptions might
indicate the presence of a pest in countries where it was not reported
before, but this always needs to be VERIFIED. The numeral at the end of
each reported non-compliance represents the number of interceptions. It
should not be considered an official statistic, but rather an indication of
the state of trade within the European area.
In most cases, interceptions occur at the time when the commodity enters
the country (seaports, airports, border crossings etc.). The commodity is
officially inspected by duly authorized phytosanitary inspectors. It may
happen that the commodity is released at the point of entry, and inspected
later at the production site to avoid unacceptable delays in trade or to
avoid damage to the plants or plant products. The commodity may also be
released but kept under surveillance waiting for the results of various tests.
All notifications of non-compliance are made in this official framework.
The aim is that the importing country informs the exporting country that
the commodity is refused entry on the basis of visual inspection and/or a
series of laboratory tests. The basis of the refusal is that it did not
comply (non-compliance) with the phytosanitary regulations of the receiving
country because the product was infected/infested with a quarantine pest
that should not be present in its territory.
[Acronyms are suggested for pathogens but only in the case where the
pathogen is cited more than once. The first time the name of the pathogen
is cited in a report, the complete name of the pathogen (bacterium, fungus,
phytoplasma) is indicated, followed by an acronym in brackets. For example,
_Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ (Cms) would refer to the
first citation of this pathogen. Subsequent reports citing the same
pathogen would read as: Cms..... . For viruses, the name of the virus is
indicated, followed by the acronym. For example, Plum pox potyvirus (PPV)
would refer to the first instance and subsequent citations would be PPV. I
invite your comments and suggestions. - Mod.DH]

* This consignment of potatoes (cv. Agria) was intercepted in October 1999
and was thought to originate from Germany. However, in January 2000, it was
discovered that these potatoes [originated in Belgium and had been
transported by a German company]. ... No potatoes cv. Agria were left in
the firm concerned. On the fields which had grown these potatoes, volunteer
plants were tested and all results were negative. In addition: 1000 tons of
cv. Nicola (40 samples) and 300 tons of cv. Bintje (12 samples) have been
tested and all results were negative. The farm concerned is under
supervision of the NPPO, and potato fields were sampled during the annual
survey for ringrot and brown rot. No samples were found positive. The NPPO
considers that Belgium is still free from Cms.
_Helminthosporium solani_ (Hs) was detected in _Solanum tuberosum_ (Seed
potatoes) originating in Netherlands and exported to Algeria 1
Hs and _Fusarium_ sp. was detected in _Solanum tuberosum_ (Seed potatoes)
originating in France and exported to Algeria 1
Pepino mosaic potexvirus (PepMV) was detected in _Lycopersicon esculentum_
(Fruits) originating in Belgium and exported to United Kingdom 1
PepMV was detected in _Lycopersicon esculentum_ (Fruits) originating in
Morocco and exported to France 1
