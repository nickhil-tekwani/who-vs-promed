RALEIGH, N.C. -- Health officials were cited as saying yesterday that a
7-year-old girl attacked by a rabid fox at a North Carolina zoo over the
weekend was the latest victim of the worst rabies outbreak in the state in
nearly 40 years. The girl, visiting the zoo with her family to celebrate her
birthday, was bitten by a wild gray fox on Saturday outside the baboon
exhibit at the North Carolina State Zoological Park in Asheboro, about 65
miles (104 km) west of Raleigh.
The fox was captured in a stand of bamboo at the zoo, and [later killed
after it tested positive for rabies. The girl is undergoing rabies
vaccination. North Carolina health officials were cited as saying they were
monitoring a "massive" wild animal rabies epizootic in the state.
The state Department of Health and Human Services documented 839 [animal
rabies cases last year, up from 10 cases in 1990, in the worst rabies
outbreak since the 1950s.
