The Costa Rican government has issued a national alert saying that alcohol tainted with methanol is behind the deaths of 19 people.

According to the government, 5 women and 14 men have died after drinking contaminated liquor since early June [2019] The Health Ministry said the victims ranged from 32 to 72 years in age.

While investigations continue, the ministry said in a report that the alcohol had been poisoned with methanol.

The deaths occurred in June and July [2019] in the Cost Rican towns of San Jose, Cartago, Limon, Guanacaste, and Heredia.

Government officials have seized about 30 000 bottles from brands suspected of containing methanol.

The ministry said it believes the tainted alcohol is just counterfeit products of known brand names. Those brands seized include Guaro Montano, Guaro Gran Apache, Star Welsh, Aguardiente Baron Rojo, Aguardiente Timbuka, and Aguardiente Molotov.

The government has warned people to avoid these brands as they investigate.

Aguardiente translates to English as 'fire water'. Both it and guaro are traditionally distilled from sugar cane.

Liquor sellers sometimes dilute products with toxic methanol to increase profit margins or raise alcohol content.

Consuming methanol can cause dizziness, drowsiness, headaches, and an inability to move muscles.

'It is important to emphasize that this information is preliminary since the investigations continue,' a statement from the ministry said.

'The Ministry of Health continues to carry out operations throughout the national territory in order to reduce the exposure of consumers to adulterated products.'

Tainted alcohol has killed 19 people in Costa Rica since June [2019]. The 14 men and 5 women ranged in age from 32 to 72, and lived in several cities, CNN reports. The alcohol they drank contained toxic levels of methanol, and the Ministry of Health has now warned against several brands of alcohol after samples tested positive for methanol adulteration; SafeProof, a group fighting "tainted, counterfeit, and fake alcohol," has a complete list [https://www.safeproof.org/tainted-aguardiente-brands-costa-rica/. Since methanol is "a close chemical cousin of potable alcohol" and also makes people feel intoxicated, it is "sometimes used by bootleggers to cheaply pad out liquor," as LiveScience explained in 2012.

But methanol, which is used in solvents and antifreeze, is metabolized differently than ethanol and can kill people in the same way typical alcohol poisoning does -- except it can do so after just a few ounces are ingested. The Costa Rican government has confiscated about 30 000 bottles of alcohol suspected to be tainted; vendors selling the tainted alcohol could face charges, CBS News reports. Methanol poisoning outbreaks have hit other countries in recent years as well, per the World Health Organization, which calls it "a relatively common form of mass poisoning."

Methanol toxicity initially lacks severe toxic manifestations. Its pathophysiology represents a classic example of lethal synthesis in which toxic metabolites cause fatality after a characteristic latent period. In other words, these people may not realize they are sick or ill until some time after consumption.

Methanol is sometimes used as an ethanol substitute for alcohol. Foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables, fruit juices, fermented beverages, and diet soft drinks containing aspartame are the primary sources of methanol in the human body, but [they contain] minute quantities.

Wood alcohol is also known as methanol. It is a commonly used toxic organic solvent causing metabolic acidosis, neurologic issues, and death when ingested. It is a part of many commercial industrial solvents and of adulterated alcoholic beverages or is mistaken as being the same as alcohol for ingestion. Methanol toxicity remains a common problem in many parts of the developing world, especially among members of lower socioeconomic classes.

Neurological complications are recognized more frequently due to advanced technologies and because of early recognition of the toxicity and advances in supportive care. Hemodialysis and better management of acid-base disturbances remain the most important therapeutic improvements.

Serum methanol levels of greater than 20 mg/dL correlate with ocular injury. Funduscopic changes are notable within only a few hours after methanol ingestion. The mechanism by which the methanol causes toxicity to the visual system is not well understood. Formic acid, the toxic metabolite of methanol, is regarded as being responsible for ocular toxicity, and blindness can occur in humans.

The prognosis in methanol poisoning correlates with the amount of methanol consumed and the subsequent degree of metabolic acidosis; more severe acidosis confers a poorer prognosis. Methanol has a relatively low toxicity. The adverse effects are thought to be from the accumulation of formic acid, a metabolite of methanol metabolism. The prognosis is further dependent on the amount of formic acid that has accumulated in the blood, with a direct correlation existing between the formic acid concentration and morbidity and mortality. Little long-term improvement can be expected in patients with neurologic complications.

The minimal lethal dose of methanol in adults is believed to be 1 mg/kg of body weight. The exact rates of morbidity and mortality from methanol intoxication are not available.

Rapid, early treatment is necessary for survival, but sequelae such as blindness may be permanent.

Metabolic acidosis in methanol poisoning may necessitate the administration of bicarbonate and assisted ventilation. Bicarbonate potentially may reverse visual deficits. In addition, bicarbonate may help to decrease the amount of active formic acid.

Antidote therapy, often using ethanol or fomepizole, is directed towards delaying methanol metabolism until the methanol is eliminated from the patient's system either naturally or via dialysis. Like methanol, ethanol is metabolized by ADH [alcohol dehydrogenase], but the enzyme's affinity for ethanol is 10-20 times higher than it is for methanol. Fomepizole is also metabolized by ADH; however, its use is limited because of high cost and lack of availability.

Hemodialysis can easily remove methanol and formic acid. Indications for this procedure include (1) greater than 30 mL [1 oz] of methanol ingested, (2) serum methanol level greater than 20 mg/dL, (3) observation of visual complications, and (4) no improvement in acidosis despite repeated sodium bicarbonate infusions.

Intravenous administration of ethanol in a 10 percent dextrose solution may be helpful. As ethanol prolongs the elimination half-life of methanol, the treatment may take several days, and the patient should be hospitalized. Dialysis may be necessary to prevent kidney failure as well. Hemodialysis remains an effective treatment.
