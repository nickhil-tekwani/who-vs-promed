Influenza activity peaking in the WHO European Region
-----------------------------------------------------

Summary
-------
- This issue is based on data reported in week 6/2011 [7-13 Feb 2011]
by 45 Member States in the WHO European Region.
- Clinical activity has apparently moved past peak in 24 countries of
the Region.
- 44 percent of sentinel specimens from patients with influenza-like
illness (ILI) and/or acute respiratory infections (ARI), and 39
percent of specimens from sentinel severe acute respiratory infection
(SARI) patients were positive for influenza.
- 97 percent of antigenically characterized viruses from the
2010/2011 influenza season are similar to the viruses included in the
2010/2011 northern hemisphere influenza vaccines.

Current situation -- week 6/2011 [7-13 Feb 2011]
------------------------------------------------
During week 6/2011, 2 countries (Georgia and Luxembourg) and the
Siberian region of the Russian Federation reported very high intensity
of influenza activity; 8 countries reported high intensity; 28
reported medium intensity; and 11 countries, low intensity. 23
countries reported widespread activity. Of the 26 countries reporting
on the impact of influenza on health care systems, 1 (Georgia)
reported severe impact; 14 countries reported moderate impact; and 11,
low impact.

Of the 41 countries reporting on consultation rates for ILI and ARI,
8 (Albania, Belarus, the Czech Republic, Iceland, Kazakhstan, Moldova,
Serbia, and Slovakia) reported increases while 6 (Ireland, Israel,
Malta, Norway, Spain, and the UK (England)) reported decreases.
Influenza activity has apparently passed its peak in 24 countries in
the Region. In general, the highest consultation rates were reported
for children aged 0-4 and 5-14 years.

WHO/Europe received sentinel surveillance data on hospitalized SARI
cases from 9 countries (Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
Romania, the Republic of Moldova, the Russian Federation, Serbia and
Ukraine). Sentinel SARI hospitalizations are at the highest levels
observed for the season so far in Georgia and Serbia. In Georgia,
however, outpatient clinical consultation rates declined from week 5
[31 Jan-6 Feb 2011] to week 6 [7-13 Feb 2011], while the relative
percentage of both SARI and ILI specimens testing positive for
influenza B increased. Sentinel SARI hospitalizations in Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, Romania, and the Russian Federation have declined somewhat
from observed peaks in weeks 3-5 [17 Jan-6 Feb 2011], but remain
notably elevated above pre-season levels, with 30-50 percent of
sentinel SARI specimens testing positive for influenza in each of
these countries. Sentinel SARI admissions in the Republic of Moldova
and Ukraine are at levels below prior peaks. Nevertheless, a
significant percentage of sentinel SARI specimens continue to test
positive for influenza, and the proportion of influenza A detections
in sentinel SARI specimens in Ukraine increased in week 6.

Virological situation -- week 6/2011 [7-13 Feb 2011]
----------------------------------------------------
Pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 was reported to be dominant in 14
countries and co-dominant with influenza B in 12 countries. Influenza
B was dominant in 7 countries. During the past few weeks, the
predominance of influenza B viruses has increased in countries in
Western Europe, which had predominantly pandemic A(H1N1) viruses
circulating at the start of their season. In a number of eastern
European countries, the predominance has now shifted from influenza B
viruses to pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 viruses.

Sentinel physicians collected 3109 respiratory specimens, of which
1373 (44 percent) were positive for influenza virus: 712 (52 percent)
were influenza A and 661 (48 percent) were influenza B. Of the
influenza A viruses, 647 were subtyped: 606 (94 percent) as pandemic
A(H1) and 41 (6 percent) as A(H3). In the 31 countries testing 20 or
more sentinel specimens, influenza positivity ranged from 9 percent to
91 percent, with a median of 46 percent (mean: 48 percent). In
addition, 6739 non-sentinel specimens were reported positive for
influenza: 5050 (75 percent) influenza A and 1689 (25 percent)
influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 4526 were subtyped: 4445 (98
percent) as pandemic A(H1) and 81 (2 percent) as A(H3). Out of 320
sentinel SARI specimens collected during week 6/2011, 125 (39 percent)
tested positive for influenza: 81 (65 percent) were influenza A; 44
(35 percent) were influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 59 were
subtyped: 58 (98 percent) as pandemic A(H1), and 1 (2 percent) as
A(H3). Of the 7 countries testing 10 or more sentinel SARI specimens,
the percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza ranged from
29 percent (Kazakhstan) to 55 percent (Republic of Moldova) with a
median of 44 percent (mean: 43 percent).

Respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) were detected in 16 countries; 14
of these reported fewer detections in week 6/2011 than during
previously observed peaks of RSV activity.

Cumulative virological update -- weeks 40/2010-6/2011 [4 Oct 2010-13
Feb 2011]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 55 529 influenza virus detections were reported during
this period, of which 39 778 (72 percent) were influenza A and 15 751
(28 percent) were influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 29 727 were
subtyped: 28 492 (96 percent) as pandemic influenza A(H1), 1234 (4
percent) as influenza A(H3), and 1 as influenza A(H1).

From week 40/2010 [4-10 Oct 2011] to week 6/2011 [7-13 Feb 2011], 756
out of 3058 sentinel SARI specimens (25 percent) tested positive for
influenza. Of these influenza viruses, 345 (46 percent) were influenza
A and 411 (54 percent) influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 246
were subtyped: 230 (93 percent) as pandemic influenza A(H1) and 16 (7
percent) as influenza A(H3).

Since week 40/2010, 1818 influenza viruses have been characterized
antigenically: 1043 were A(H1) pandemic A/California/7/2009
(H1N1)-like; 626 were B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (B/Victoria/2/87
lineage); 93 were A(H3) A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)-like; 55 were
B/Florida/4/2006-like (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage); and 1 was
B/Bangladesh/3333/2007-like (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage). Based on the
genetic characterization of 311 influenza viruses, 147 belonged to the
pandemic A/California/7/2009 A(H1N1) clade; 7 belonged to the pandemic
A/Christchurch/16/2010 A(H1) clade; 23 belonged to the pandemic A/Hong
Kong/2213/2010 A(H1) clade; 25 were reported as A(H1) pandemic not
attributed to group category but belonging to the recently emerged
A/England/142/2010 subgroup characterized by S185T substitution in the
HA; 9 belonged to the A(H3) clade represented by A/Perth/16/2009; 6
belonged to the A(H3) clade represented by A/Victoria/208/2009; 20
belonged to the subgroup represented by A/Hong Kong/2121/2010 in the
A/Victoria/208/2009 A(H3) clade; 8 belonged to the
B/Bangladesh/3333/2007 clade (Yamagata lineage); and 66 to the
B/Brisbane/60/2008 clade (Victoria lineage).

Since week 40/2010, 5 countries (Ireland, Italy, Norway, Spain, and
the UK) have screened 801 viruses for susceptibility to the
neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir. The UK analysed
most of the viruses screened (671). Out of the total of 738 isolates
of pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 viruses that were tested, 710 were
sensitive to both inhibitors and 28 viruses (3.8 percent) carried the
NA H275Y mutation. These 28 viruses were resistant to oseltamivir but
remained sensitive to zanamivir. One influenza A(H3N2) virus was
tested and found to be sensitive to both inhibitors. All of the 61
influenza B viruses tested for susceptibility to oseltamivir and the
62 tested for susceptibility to zanamivir were found to be sensitive.
All 35 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 viruses and 2 A(H3N2) viruses
that were screened for susceptibility to adamantanes were found to be
resistant.

Comment
-------
ILI and ARI clinical consultation rates and the percentage of
sentinel specimens testing positive for influenza remain high in the
WHO European Region, particularly in the central, eastern and
south-eastern parts. Influenza activity is generally progressing in a
west-to-east manner across the Region, with pandemic influenza A(H1N1)
2009 circulation decreasing in the western part and increasing in the
central and eastern parts. Influenza B is becoming relatively more
predominant in countries where the circulation of pandemic influenza A
(H1N1) 2009 is decreasing. This pattern is also apparent in sentinel
SARI hospitalizations, which are associated with both influenza A and
influenza B infections. Currently 97 percent of antigenically
characterized viruses from the 2010/2011 influenza season are similar
to the viruses recommended for inclusion in the 2010/2011 northern
hemisphere influenza vaccines.

[In brief: influenza activity is generally progressing in a
west-to-east manner across the Region, with pandemic influenza A(H1N1)
2009 circulation decreasing in the western part and increasing in the
central and eastern parts. Influenza activity has passed its peak in
24 countries in 41 countries of the Region. In general, the highest
consultation rates were reported for children aged 0-4 and 5-14 years.
Influenza B is becoming relatively more predominant in countries where
the circulation of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 is decreasing. In
contrast, in a number of eastern European countries, the predominance
has now shifted from influenza B viruses to pandemic influenza A(H1N1)
2009 viruses. This pattern is markedly different from that observed
currently in North America (see Influenza (15): USA update
20110217.0523). To what extent this reflects differences in patterns
of vaccine uptake remains to be analysed.

(intensity, trend, geographical spread, and impact) and the dominant
virus as assessed by each of the countries. - Mod.CP]
