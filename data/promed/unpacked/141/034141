TUBERCULOSIS TRANSMISSION RISK IN AIDS PATIENTS (7)
==================================================
[A posting yesterday, inquiring about the report by Dannte
Landucci on Mycobacterial detection, asked whether any of
the patients were on corticosteroids or other
immunosuppressive medication.]
None of the patients received corticosteroids. At the time, I was unaware
of the potential of such medications to transiently improve the clinical
status of patients with tuberculosis. As I was focused only on the
potentially adverse effects of administering such agents in the presence of
active tuberculosis, I can be reasonably certain of this.
