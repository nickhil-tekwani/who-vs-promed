Over 180 cases of Dengue have been detected within the Colombo
metropolis, giving rise to a fear that the disease could assume
epidemic proportions if uncontrolled.
"The numbers detected so far reveal an increase of over 90 percent
over 2003", Dr. Pradeep Kariyawasam, Chief Medical Officer of the
Colombo Municipal Council told the Sunday Observer.
Dr. Kariyawasam said that there were usually 2 peaks of the disease
during a year, from June to July and December to January, which
followed heavy rains. He said that in 2003, it was possible to avert
a crisis because the CMC had carried out a dengue awareness campaign
and conducted house-to-house visits to detect dengue breeding sites,
in March, before the onset of the peak season.
"We also imposed fines and warned all householders who had dengue
breeding sites that we would take stern action if they did not clean
their surroundings at our next visit. This proved a deterrent and we
were able to bring the disease under control", he said.
Emphasising the importance of a sustained campaign to create
awareness on the prevention of dengue, the CMC spokesman said that
experience had proved that the public on the whole had a short memory
and tended to forget that environmental cleanliness was the most
effective way of eliminating the dengue-carrying vector.
"We therefore have to remind them constantly, and carrying out
surveys and awareness campaigns is the best way to do this", he said.
He added that in addition to poorly maintained gardens, many
residents were guilty of breeding mosquitoes within their homes in
flower vases, flower pots and ant traps.
Currently the CMC is carrying out fogging and spraying of chemicals
in high-risk areas, but because the dengue carrying mosquito is a
low-flying insect, these activities have not proved 100 percent
effective, the CMC spokesman said.
In order to create awareness on dengue, the CMC hopes to conduct a
big campaign involving CMC staff, medical students of the Colombo
medical faculty, and Rotarians who will inspect houses in the city,
distribute leaflets and enlist the support of the public to maintain
a mosquito-free environment both outside and within their homes.
A survey carried out in 2003 revealed that the dengue-carrying vector
was found not only in the slums and other poor districts of the city
but in plush residential areas such as Colombo 3,4 and 7 as well.
Broken and clogged drains, uncleared dirt, coconut shells and tyres
left lying around in gardens are some of the common causes for the
spread of dengue.

Health experts face dengue resistance
-----------------------------------
Health authorities in Townsville are encountering new opposition to
their efforts to control dengue fever. The dengue fever outbreak has
now reached 47 cases, with the latest cases in North Ward, Gulliver
and Aitkenvale.
John Piispanen from the Tropical Public Health Unit says some
residents in North Ward have been resisting efforts to eradicate
mosquito breeding sites in and around their homes.
"There's nothing that people would like worse than having to go out
house-to-house for dengue," he said. "I think these people do need a
lot of support, I think what they don't need are terrible dogs biting
them and people hosing them and people having a go at them...give
them your support and hopefully we can do something about getting rid
of this dengue problem."
