SARCOCYSTIS NEURONA IN OPOSSUMS (3)

Dr. Fenger...
Thank you for your response to my queries about Sarcocystis neurona.
Apologies for miscrediting the research...I did not personally read
the article in Equus; my friend with the horses did and provided the
information. Your info is quite interesting.
I am curious about the differences between the spp. neurona, falcatula
and rileyi. Are all three responsible for the same neurologic symptoms;
are all treatment protocols similar?
Regarding our native marsupial, D. virginiana, I work with them in a
rehabilitation setting. Obviously, given this context, I am not likely
to euthanize them. While they usually carry a load of parasites (as do
other carnivores), they are uniquely resistant to many diseases and
viruses that affect and spread among other animals; I believe they are
vectors for few. In rehab settings, other species present the major
zoonotic concerns. Opossums are also responsible for keeping rodent and
snake populations at bay where there is feed/hay etc in abundance. I
believe there is greater concern with these species...
Opossum feces are soft and last a very short time in natural settings.
Researchers cannot easily locate populations or identify diet as with
other wildife by use of fecal remains. Yet the article in Equus
indicated that sporocytes lasted up to a year, if I understand correctly,
in the feces. What is the setting? What happens to the sporocyte when
the fecal substrate disappears? Do they remain viable in soil?
Merck Veterinary Manual that cats and dogs are likely to be carriers of
the protozoan (although S. neurona is not specifically cited); opossums
are not mentioned as a carrier. Can other carnivores/omnivores --
anything that feeds on cowbirds or starlings -- also provide sanctuary
as secondary host?
Can the sporocytes be detected in fecal floats or smears of the opossum?
Thanks for bearing with this long post, and regards,
Nancy Hawekotte

I want to clarify a few of the items in my previous post to this
group...
Opossums have a relatively small individual range (150-250 acres),
and therefore, trapping and relocating should theoretically be as
effective as killing them. Be sure to release the opossums in areas
that are sufficiently distant from horse-raising property. If you
choose to trap and release them, remember that they can bite, and
are extremely dangerous, similar to most wild animals (although
they rarely carry rabies). Again, be sure to check with state and
local authorities regarding any regulations about handling wildlife.
Alternatively, opossums can be discouraged from entering barns by
covering garbage and feed cans, NOT leaving cat and dog food out at
night, and securing hay lofts and feed rooms as much as possible.
Dogs are excellent opossum deterrents. Personally, I would extremely
fearful of using hay that has opossum excrement on it as feed for
horses.
Preventative measures such as coccidiostats cannot be used in horses
because they are toxic to horses. (They are not that effective in the
prevention of Sarcocystosis anyway) Periodic treatment with pyrimethamine
and sulfonamides has been recommended in the past, but are NOT currently
recommended because this regimen is likely to encourage the development
of resistant protozoa.

[- Nancy Hawekotte makes an excellent point about faecal consistancy.
If not deposited in hay or on feed, as Clara Fenger points out, faeces
will very soon be broken up in pasture by dung beetles and rain, and the
cysts dispersed. Further rain and u/v light will diminish the risk still
further. - MH-J ProMED-Ahead Moderator]
