We would like to inform you that our diagnostic laboratory at the Animal Health Trust (AHT) in Newmarket, United Kingdom has confirmed further positive cases of equine influenza in the UK. Areas affected since 29 Sep 2014 include Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Worcestershire, Cumbria, Kent, West Midlands and Cambridgeshire in England, as well as South Ayrshire, Ayrshire, the Scottish Borders and Perthshire in Scotland.

The diagnoses were made following positive qRT-PCR [quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR] assays performed on nasopharyngeal swabs sample taken from animals presenting with clinical signs including nasal discharge, coughing and lethargy. Some of the affected animals were recently imported from Ireland.

Virus isolation and characterisation is currently underway at the AHT, and early results indicate that the viruses isolated from these cases belong to clade 2 of the Florida sub lineage. Further details will be made available at http://www.equiflunet.org.uk as soon as possible.
