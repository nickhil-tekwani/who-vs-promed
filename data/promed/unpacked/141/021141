African swine fever [ASF] was found in hogs in the northern Russian
region of Murmansk, according to Rosselkhoznadzor, the food safety
watchdog.

The virus was found in several pigs in the Severomorsk settlement,
and the entire herd of 21 animals has been slaughtered,
Rosselkhoznadzor said in an e-mailed statement today [6 Apr 2011].
Veterinarians are investigating.

Three cases were found in and around St. Petersburg in January 2011.
Most other cases have been found in southern areas.

[According to a news release of 6 Apr 2011 in the Russian web-site of
Rosselkhoznadzor (http://www.rosselkhoznadzor.ru/fsvps), the
All-Russian Research Institute of Veterinary Virology and Microbiology
has identified genetic material of ASF virus in samples from pigs kept
in private farms located in a closed settlement, Severomorsk (other
names: Vaenka, Vayenga, Vaenga), Murmansk Region (oblast). The
mortality had started on 26 Mar 2011. Animals on the affected premises
were destroyed by a "bloodless method" (gas?). Additional measures are
said to have been applied to eliminate the outbreak; an investigation
to clarify the route of ASFV introduction is underway.

ASF is now circulating throughout vast parts of European Russia, from
the southernmost Trans Caucasus region to northern Murmansk, most
probably spread, on top of the slow dissemination by animal movement
(including wild boars), also by "jumps" by the transportation of
contaminated food or waste of swine origin. A review, dated 22 Mar
2011, is available at
http://archive.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/monitoring/documents/poa-russia-110322.pdf.

Results of the investigation will be appreciated.

For the location of Severomorsk, in the utmost north of European
Russia, some 150 km from Norway's northern border and 250 km from the
Finnish border, see maps at
