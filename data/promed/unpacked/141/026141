Influenza update - 309 (based on data up to 4 Feb 2018)
------------------------------------------
Influenza activity remained high in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, while in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, activity was at inter-seasonal levels. Worldwide, influenza A accounted still for the majority of influenza detections, but influenza B (mostly B-Yamagata lineage) increased in recent weeks.

Up to now, the majority of countries in influenza season reported influenza-like illness reaching moderate levels in comparison with previous years, with few reaching levels exceeding those of previous years. Some countries, however, have reported levels of hospitalization and ICU admissions reaching or exceeding peak levels of previous influenza seasons. WHO recommends countries with current influenza activity or entering their season to adopt necessary measures for ensuring appropriate case management, compliance with infection control measures, and seasonal influenza vaccination for high risk groups (see also the fact sheet given below).

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 104 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the period from 22 Jan 2018 to 4 Feb 2018 (data as of 2018-02-16 04:33:50 UTC). The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 302 596 specimens during that period. 98 068 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 54 142 (55.2 percent) were typed as influenza A and 43 926 (44.8 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 10 290 (58 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and 7441 (42 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 7553 (92.5 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 615 (7.5 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Week 7/2018 (12-18 Feb 2018)
- Influenza activity was widespread in the majority of reporting countries, with overall 51 percent of individuals sampled from primary healthcare testing positive for influenza. The detection rate decreased slightly compared to the previous week (53 percent).

- Both influenza virus types A and B were co-circulating with a higher proportion of type B viruses. Different proportions of circulating influenza virus types and A subtypes were observed between countries.

- The majority of severe cases admitted to non-ICU hospital wards were adults infected by influenza type B viruses. The majority of severe cases admitted to ICU were adults infected mostly by influenza type A viruses.

2017/18 season overview
----------------------
- For the region overall, a higher proportion of type B compared to type A viruses has been detected in sentinel and non-sentinel sources, representing a high level of influenza B compared with previous seasons. Of the type A detections from sentinel sources, whereby the majority of viruses were subtyped, A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have outnumbered A(H3N2) viruses. In non-sentinel sources, whereby only 35 percent of influenza viruses were subtyped, more A(H3N2) viruses were reported than A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses.

- The majority of severe cases reported this season are due to influenza B and occur in persons above the age of 15 years. In confirmed influenza cases in ICU, similar numbers were infected by influenza type A and B viruses, and approximately equal numbers of cases were reported in the 15-64 and over-64-year age groups. In laboratory confirmed cases reported in wards other than ICU, type B viruses were detected approximately twice as frequently as type A viruses, and twice as many cases occurred among those aged over 64 years compared with patients in the 15-64 age group.

- Concomitant with the increase in influenza activity, mortality due to any cause among the elderly has significantly increased over the past weeks in the western parts of the region based on data provided by 20 EU countries to EuroMOMO.

- For type B viruses from both sentinel and non-sentinel sources, B/Yamagata lineage viruses have greatly outnumbered those of the B/Victoria lineage. The current trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine does not include a virus from the B/Yamagata lineage.

- Different patterns of dominant type and A subtype were observed between the countries of the region, which may be due to differences in relative weights of information being derived from sentinel, non-sentinel and severe influenza case sources of information.

- While low in number, 59 percent of the genetically characterized A(H3N2) viruses belong to clade 3C.2a, the clade of the vaccine virus described in the WHO recommendations for vaccine composition for the northern hemisphere 2017-2018, and 37 percent to subclade 3C.2a1, with mammalian cell-cultured viruses in both clades being antigenically similar.

- Although low in number detected and characterised, an increasing percentage (currently 40 percent) of B/Victoria lineage viruses belonged to B/Norway/2409/2017, representing the Victoria lineage clade 1A with deletion 162-163, which is antigenically different from the current quadrivalent vaccine component B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus.

- Interim or real-time vaccine effectiveness estimates from Canada, Finland, Germany, Spain, Stockholm County and the United States of America suggest overall vaccine effectiveness of 15-46 percent, depending on the proportions of circulating (sub)types. Effectiveness against influenza B is in the range of 16-67 percent, despite the circulating lineage not being included in the most commonly used trivalent vaccine.

- Additional information on global influenza activity is available from WHO's biweekly global updates. WHO convened the Vaccine Composition Meeting on 19-21 Feb 2018 and recommended the composition of the 2018-2019 northern hemisphere vaccine.

[3] WHO: composition of influenza virus vaccines, 2018-2019 northern hemisphere season
Date: Thu 22 Feb 2018
Source: Influenza Vaccines WHO recommendations on the composition of influenza virus vaccines [edited]
http://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/recommendations/2018_19_north/en/


The WHO Consultation on the Composition of Influenza Virus Vaccines for Use in the 2018-2019 Northern Hemisphere Influenza Season finishes today [22 Feb 2018] with the information meeting and round-table discussion on matters relating to influenza vaccine development and production.

It is recommended that quadrivalent vaccines for use in the 2018-2019 northern hemisphere influenza season contain the following:
- an A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;
- an A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 (H3N2)-like virus;
- a B/Colorado/06/2017-like virus (B/Victoria/2/87 lineage); and
- a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage).

It is recommended that the influenza B virus component of trivalent vaccines for use in the 2018-2019 northern hemisphere influenza season be a B/Colorado/06/2017-like virus of the B/Victoria/2/87-lineage.
