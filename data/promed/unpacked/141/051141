--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
During the 2019/20 and 2020/21 cropping season, a new disease was observed in different areas of the country. Infected parts of plants were swollen and filled with teliospores. A smut fungus was suspected, which is known to attack reproductive organs of tef plants before heading. Samples from diseased tef varieties were collected and observed under a microscope without culturing because the pathogen is obligate.

To confirm presence of a smut, healthy teff seeds were imbibed with suspensions of teliospores from field samples and planted in a glasshouse. They developed the same symptoms as observed in the field, while unimbibed seeds remained symptomless.

On the basis of these results, the disease was identified as smut. Species-level identification of this pathogen, evaluation of sensitivity of teff genotypes to the disease, distribution of the pathogen, and determination of its host range remain to be carried out as future work.

[Teff (_Eragrostis tef_; 'love grass') is a grass cultivated for its edible seeds. It originates from Ethiopia, where it is one of the most important cereal staple crops but is also widely grown in other countries in the region. Teff is thought to be one of the earliest plants used in agriculture.

Smut fungi are serious pathogens of a number of cereal crops. Symptoms may include stunting of plants, premature flowering, and the replacement of seeds by a black mass of spores that drastically affect plant vigour and biomass. Plants may die, and yield is reduced or completely lost. Grain quality is also severely affected; grain contaminated with spores may not be fit for consumption. Disease management may include fungicides (mostly too expensive for smallholders), use of clean planting material, phytosanitation, and planting of alternative crops not susceptible to the respective fungus. Molecular identification of the above suspected smut pathogen, followed by development of resistant teff cultivars from local germplasm, will be important for effective control of the disease.
