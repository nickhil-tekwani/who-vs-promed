Leptospirosis toll rises to 75
------------------------------
With 4 more deaths reported today [6 Sep 2004] -- 3 from the

official sources said.
"Out of 550 registered cases, 37 deaths were reported from the
worst-affected Navsari district, 31 from Surat, and 7 from Valsad

[It seems that the diagnosis of leptospirosis is not well established
here as of yet. - Mod.LL]
[Surat was the focus of the plague outbreak in 1994 -- see CDC MMWR
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/wk/mm4341.pdf>. However, there is no report of
rat-fall (rat die-off) this time, so plague can likely be excluded. - Mod.JW]
