LEGIONNAIRE'S DISEASE EPIDEMIOLOGY (6)
======================================
[Collecting further replies on differentiating community acquired
and nosocomial cases, continued from "Legionnaire's disease
epidemiology" (4) and (5):]

As Dr. Wallis already suggested, the first step is to establish a diagnosis.
If it is confirmed as Legionella spp., then consider whether there is any
epidemiologic link between your two cases. From what you describe, there is
no suspicion of common source exposure (unless, of course, both cases
resided down-wind of some point source elsewhere in the community). Unless
person "A" was readmitted soon after a previous discharge, that case sounds
like a community acquired disease, and any of a number of infectious
diseases would be more common than Legionnaire's Disease. Person "B" could
be relapse or superinfection, from what you described; again, any of a
number of pathogens are likely. Person-to-person transmission would be most
unusual: if you have a cluster of cases, then typing to determine clonal
relationship between isolates could be useful (J CLIN MICROBIOL contains a
number of good references on typing Legionella spp.). Onset of disease
after the second day of hospitalization is a clue to infections being
nosocomial, but an incubation period long enough to extend back to community
exposure prior to admission can complicate classification.
It isn't clear why you've suggested Legionnaire's given the information
provided, nor how you're involved in these cases. You may want to go back
to the literature to gain perspective on the problem of legionellosis in
hospitals. Victor Yu has written several good papers on risk factors and
disease patterns in sporadic and epidemic Legionnaire's Disease. There are
a number of good outbreak reports, some of which give a comprehensive
picture (eg: Struelens MJ, Maes N, Rost F, et al., Genotypic and Phenotypic
Methods for the Investigation of a Nosocomial Legionella pneumophilia
Outbreak & Efficacy of Control Measures. J INFECT DIS 1992;166:22-30).

In response to Jospeh Wagner's question about differentiating community
acquired vs nosocomial Legionnaire's, I would think, the distinction would be
made based primarily on history. The majority of L pneumophila is type 1, so
typing would not help. Additionally, nosocomial infection is estimated to be
at least 14% of all hospital acquired pneumonias, so it is not uncommon.
In the cases presented, I assume that Legionnaire's was diagnosed post
mortum, because the final bacteriologic diagnosis is not actually mentioned
in the case reports. Neither patient was reported to be immunosuppressed.
Both patients had severe pulmonary infections on admission though the second
(20 y.o.) seemed to improve then suddenly crashed after 4 days. It would
help to know the bacteriological findings throughtout the couse of both
patient's hospitalizations (i.e. what did the sputum grow at different
times). Also knowing what antibiotics were used, and when, would be helpful.
I see no reason to presuppose anything but community acquired disease in the
1 year old. But the age makes me think of the possibility of cystic
fibrosis. Was this looked for and was the diagnosis of Legionnaire's
confirmed? If the sputum grew pseudomonas at any time, CF should be
considered. The second case is not as clear cut. This patient could have
had an initial rally due to good pulmonary toilet and better hydration, or he
could have acquired the Legionnaire's after being placed on the ventilator
(with an incubation period of as little as 2 days, this is certainly
possible).
I would also be interested to know if these patients had anything in common,
such at temporally related admissions, or use of the same ventilator or same
room.
I hope this helps, though I'm afraid it raises more questions than it
answers.
