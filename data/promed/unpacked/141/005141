An industrial, cooperative dairy farm in a southern Kibbutz, HaDarom (South) district, has been found to be infected with _Brucella melitensis_. Of the 1350 lactating cows, 12 per cent (135 animals) have been found positive by the CF [complement fixation] test; all positive cows have been separated and subsequently culled. The causative bacterium has been isolated and identified from the blood and placenta of an aborting heifer. There have been 2 additional abortions (registered but not sampled) on the farm.

The index case in this event was the attending veterinary practitioner.

[The briefly described event reflects the deteriorated brucellosis situation in Israel, as described in detail in posting 20150801.3550984. The fact that the pathogen spread extensively in the dairy operation, discovered only after the diagnosis of a human case, is rather concerning. Periodic milk tank sampling and testing is meant to discover brucellosis infection in herds earlier. The history of the testing regime in this herd deserves to be reviewed. It will be also interesting to note if vaccinated animals are included among the positive ones.

It may be assumed that the infection in this event originated in neighboring sheep/goat flocks. The route of _B. melitensis_ introduction from infected flocks into the (zero-grazing) Kibbutz dairy farm is yet to be established.

Brucellosis in livestock in Israel is caused, since decades, exclusively by _B. melitensis_. The pathogen of bovine brucellosis, _B. abortus_, which causes massive abortions in this species, has been long eradicated.

Humans are mostly infected by the consumption of unpasteurized dairy products originating from extensively held, infected dairy sheep and goat flocks. However, about 20 per cent of the human cases are known to be infected directly from animals. Occasionally, cattle are infected as well, becoming an efficient source of human infection. In difference with sheep and goats, _B. melitensis_ rarely causes abortion in cattle, their infection expected to be discovered by the application of periodic milk tank sampling and testing.

The deterioration in the brucellosis situation in Israel is reflected by the following statistics published by Israel's Ministry of Health addressing human cases: 2005 - 141, 2006 - 138, 2007 - 152, 2008 - 149, 2009 - 136, 2010 - 139, 2012 - 183, 2013 - 336, 2014 - 596.

According to the ministry's most recent available Weekly Epidemiological Report, dated 3 Oct 2015, the accumulated number of officially reported new human brucellosis cases since the beginning of 2015 is 349, compared with 539 during the same period in 2014. While 2014 seems to have been a record year (a total of 596 human cases in 52 weeks), 2015's figures are still higher than all years previous to 2014.

The described situation may not be attributed to a change in the hygiene measures in patients' kitchens (deplorable as they may be) but to increased exposure to the pathogen, namely spread within the animal vectors. Financial losses caused by the disease to animal owners (abortions in sheep and goats) are much lower than the devastating damage to human health. This is an obstacle in obtaining the owners' cooperation, unless control measures, including vaccination and animal identification, are free of charge and full, immediate compensations are paid when animals are culled.

The affected dairy cattle farm has to undergo repeated tests, applying the "test and slaughter" policy until declared free. In case of excessive infection rate, it may become necessary to cull the entire herd. In the past, such a measure was applied at least once. - Mod.AS
