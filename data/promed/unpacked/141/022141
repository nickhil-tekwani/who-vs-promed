Scientists are predicting that artemisinin-resistant malaria found on the border of Thailand and Myanmar could now spread to India and then Africa as resistance to other antimalarial drugs has done before. Artemisinin was recently adopted as the 1st-line treatment for malaria.

According to a new study, if the artemisinin-resistant malaria does spread, eliminating the disease could prove impossible and will threaten initiatives to reduce its global burden.

The study, funded by researchers from Shoklo Malaria Research Unit and Texas Biomedical Research Institute, followed reports in 2009 of the emergence of artemisinin-resistant malaria parasites in western Cambodia, 800 km away from the Thailand-Myanmar border, where the new cases of resistance have been found.

Resistance to artemisinin makes the drug less effective and could eventually render it obsolete, putting millions of lives at risk. In the study, the researchers measured the time taken to clear parasites from the blood stream in 3202 patients infected with falciparum malaria using oral artesunate medications over a 10 year period between 2001 and 2010.

Over this period, the average time taken to reduce the number of parasites in the blood by a half (the "parasite clearance half-life") increased from 2.6 hours in 2001 to 3.7 hours in 2010, a clear sign that the drugs were becoming less effective. The proportion of slow-clearing infections (a half-life of over 6.2 hours) increased over this same period from 6 to 200 out of every 1000 infections.

By examining the genetic make-up of the parasites, the researchers were able to provide compelling evidence that the decline in the parasite clearance rates was due to genetic changes in the parasites which had made them resistant to the drugs.

Francois Nosten, director of the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit, said: "We have now seen the emergence of malaria resistant to our best drugs, and these resistant parasites are not confined to western Cambodia. This is very worrying indeed and suggests that we are in a race against time to control malaria in these regions before drug resistance worsens, develops and spreads further. The effect of that happening could be devastating. Malaria already kills hundreds of thousands of people a year. If our drugs become ineffective, this figure will rise dramatically."

Tim Anderson from the Texas Biomedical Research Institute, who led the study said: "Mapping the geographical spread of resistance can be particularly challenging using existing clinical and parasitology tools. If we can identify the genetic determinants of artemisinin resistance, we should be able to confirm potential cases of resistance more rapidly. This could be critically important for limiting further spread of resistance. We know that the genome region identified harbours a number of potential genes for us to explore further to see which ones drive artemisinin resistance. If we can pinpoint the precise gene or genes, we can begin to understand how resistance occurs."

According to the World Malaria Report 2011, the most effective anti-malarial drug is artemisinin; artemisinin derivatives, most commonly artesunate, have an advantage over other antimalarial drugs such as chloroquine and mefloquine, because of acting more rapidly and having fewer side effects and, until recently, malaria parasites have shown no resistance against them.

Although the drugs can be used on their own as a monotherapy, and these can still be obtained, fears over the possible development of resistance led to recommendations that they should only be used in conjunction with one or more other drugs as artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs).

These are now recommended by the World Health Organization as the 1st-line treatment for uncomplicated falciparum malaria in all endemic countries. ACTs have contributed substantially to the recent decline in malaria cases in most tropical endemic regions.

[This news item refers to the paper: Aung Pyae Phyo, et al. Emergence of artemisinin-resistant malaria on the western border of Thailand: a longitudinal study. Lancet. 2012 Apr 5. [Epub ahead of print]. Abstract available at http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2812%2960484-X/abstract

The paper concludes: "Genetically determined artemisinin resistance in _P. falciparum_ emerged along the Thailand-Myanmar border at least 8 years ago and has since increased substantially. At this rate of increase, resistance will reach rates reported in western Cambodia in 2-6 years."

The increase in artemisinin resistance on the Myanmar-Thai and Thai-Cambodia borders is very disturbing. The Thai border areas are hotspots of malaria resistance, also 1st reporting chloroquine resistance in the 1960s and mefloquine, quinine and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamin resistance in the 1980s and early 1990s. It is not entirely clear what drives the development of resistance, but counterfeit drugs, substandard drugs, and inadequate dosage schedules certainly are important factors. - Mod.EP
