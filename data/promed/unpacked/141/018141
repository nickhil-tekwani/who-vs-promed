We ask every ProMED-mail subscriber who has an e-mail contact in China to
forward this message to that person.
********************************
This is a call for more people in China to subscribe to ProMED-mail -- it´s
free!
It is absurd that out of our 15,000 subscribers in 150 countries we only
have 33 from China, the world´s biggest country with one-fifth of the
globe´s population -- and 17 of those are in Hong Kong. According to
today´s news report from the Comdex trade fair in Beijing, there are 2
million Internet users in China.
You can see above what we´ve posted so far from China this year. Chinese
subscribers will see a similar range of reports from neighboring countries
& worldwide. It is the most convenient way of keeping up-to-date with
current outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases 7 days a week. Health
agencies in many countries subscribe to ProMED-mail for just that reason.
We would very much like to know from China the final diagnosis of the food
poisoning episode in Hong Kong earlier this month, of the zoo giraffe
deaths last month, and of the virulent flu that swept through North China
at the beginning of the year. If anyone can tell us, please do.
The easiest way to find out more about us, and to subscribe, is to visit
our web pages:

To subscribe by e-mail, all you need to do is to send the words: info
promed to:
majordomo@usa.healthnet.org (NOT to the Reply address on this message) &
follow the instructions.
We hope to see you soon!
Best wishes,
Jack
