The ministry of health announces that based on data received from health workers, a total of 322 suspected measles cases have been reported in 5 counties [in Liberia]. Laboratory tests have identified and confirmed 72 of them.

Speaking at the Ministry of Information's regular briefing Thu 3 Mar 2022, the Director for the expanded program on immunization, Mr Adolphus T Clark disclosed that this total number shows the country is experiencing a high periodic upgrade of measles in certain areas, including districts that these cases are coming from.

"We have cases coming from Montserrado, Nimba, Bong, Margibi, and Maryland counties," Mr Clark revealed.

However, he claims there are ongoing efforts by the ministry of health to ensure the situation is brought under control.

"So we are working with our county health teams, our district health teams, as well as the health facilities to conduct 2nd trial vaccination around the community that is affected and then the national effort to be by the 4th quarter of this year [2022]."

"So, we will be targeting children between 9 months up to less than 15 years." He says.

Director Clark says data received from these cases, suggests that the number of cases is almost 1.97 times higher in 2022.

"This means that we need a national effort to intervene relatively to measles cases otherwise we may just be seen the tip of the iceberg."

[When the 2014 measles vaccine campaign was suspended due to the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola outbreak, the immunity gap led to the largest measles outbreak Liberia had seen in years. In response to this outbreak, Liberia began a systematic community outreach campaign to restore vaccination rates. - Mod.LK

[2] Afghanistan: increasing cases

As Afghanistan is going through the worst humanitarian situation in decades and over half of the population needs life-saving assistance in the country, measles has spread in several provinces of Afghanistan and affected 15 900 children since the beginning of 2022.

The Ministry of Public Health of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan said that the disease has also claimed the lives of 124 minors. The ministry has said that most of the children have lost lives in the Afghan capital Kabul, Helmand, and Kunduz provinces while most cases of measles have been recorded in Jawzjan, Ghor, and Kunduz provinces.

It comes as the Ministry has launched a 6-day vaccination drive in provinces with most cases of measles.

Unhealthy and insufficient food for children [makes them more susceptible to measles]. The thing that is not rare in a country where 97 percent of people are living under the poverty line.

["The low routine measles immunization coverage of 66% [in Afghanistan] and longer interval since the measles follow-up campaign in 2018 have resulted in the accumulation of the high number of children under 5 years old with no measles immunization, said WHO."

"The rise in measles cases in Afghanistan is especially concerning because of the extremely high levels of malnutrition. [Malnutrition contributes to weakening immunity, making people more vulnerable to illness and death from diseases like measles -- especially children]," WHO Representative in Afghanistan Dr Luo Dapeng said.

"The health emergency comes as officials at the United Nations say decades of conflict, a devastating drought, a collapsing economy and the impact of international sanctions on Taliban rulers are causing "irreparable damage" to Afghan children.

"The UN estimates that around 23 million people, more than half of Afghanistan's population, need humanitarian assistance. It says one in 3 people faces acute hunger and 2 million children are malnourished."
