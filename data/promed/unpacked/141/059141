Another 16 anthrax infected people were detected yesterday [13 Sep
2010] in 2 districts of the country. The newly infected people raised
the infected accounts to 495.

Among the newly contaminated people, 7 were from the Araihazar
Upazila [sub district] of Narayangonj district while the 9 others
were from Charghat Upazila of Rajshahi district. The detected people
of Araihazar area was sent to Upazila Health Centre yesterday [13 Sep
2010] and the on-duty doctor identified them as anthrax infected.
Medical officer on duty Dr Zinat Ara said they are certainly infected
by anthrax but no need to be anxious as we have taken necessary
initiatives for their proper treatment.

Referring to the infection, locals said a resident of Kalyanadi
village bought a cow just before the Eid and doubted that it might be
anthrax affected. Later, he brought the cow to the local livestock
hospital for its treatment. Finding no improvement of treatment, he
slaughtered the cow and distributed its meat to at least 50 families
of that area. As a result, some of them got infected by eating its
meat.

Mentioning the latest [numbers of human anthrax caes], director of
Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) said
"we have detected 495 cases from 18 Aug 2010 to 13 Sep 2010 and after
treatment more than 90 percent of the infected people have recovered
while others are under treatment." He also said that close monitoring
and a massive awareness programme was going on.

The IEDCR director suggested that people should not pay heed to
rumours that fish, birds, etc are being infected by anthrax. It only
infects cattle and never spreads from human to human.

Meanwhile, the local residents of Dhamrai had been given anthrax
vaccine yesterday [13 Sep 2010], though the deaths of birds and
animals in that area were not caused by anthrax. Dhamrai health and
family planning officer Sukumar Sarker said the locals were given
anthrax vaccine as a precaution, though no anthrax affected people
were identified or admitted to hospitals.

The officials have collected specimens from the cow and other
animals, also asked people not to consume meat of that cow, which
they suspect might have contracted anthrax.

Local residents said 41 families of Kayetpara together bought 3 cows
from Kalampur market. Those cows were brought from Sirajganj, from
where anthrax has spread recently. One of the buyers said one of the
cows had lesions on its body. "It was slaughtered on Friday night [10
Sep 2010] and the families took their share of meat. But as it was
late, the blood was not covered up with mud," he added.

The locals informed the Upazila livestock officials that for some
inexplicable reasons, several ducks, chickens, pigeons, crows, dogs,
and cats were found dead in the area until Saturday noon [11 Sep
2010].

Experts from Dhaka also visited the area, collected specimens from
the dead and the cow's blood, and sent them to the Dhaka's Institute
of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IEDCR). Deputy director
of the divisional livestock directorate Dr Mosaddek Hossain said:
"The matter can be resolved after we get the report in 3 days." But,
primarily, the reason could be 'blood poisoning', he said. "We're
taking steps to vaccinate the people who consumed meat of that ailing
cow. A monitoring team will also be sent to the area," he added. The
official, however, claimed that no bird or animal dies of anthrax.

None of those who had the beef was admitted to hospital and there had
been no anthrax patients identified in Dhamrai.

Until 9 Sep 2010, at least 479 people have contracted anthrax in 8
Upazila around the country since 18 Aug 2010.

[There is a photo attached to this report of dead pigeons littering
the ground. Whatever they died of, it was not anthrax as small and
medium sized birds are resistant to infection with _Bacillus
anthracis_; their body temperature is too high to allow infection. On
the other hand dogs and cats would be infected if they had lapped up
the infected blood. But their deaths were very rapid. I suspect
someone had wittingly or unwittingly put out some poison. But it sure
made for good copy and heightening everyone's fears. This points up
the need for making sure that the journalists reporting on an event
are properly briefed.
