[1] Ebola: How does mortality compare with other diseases?

This article presents data on how [mortality from] Ebola actually compares to previous outbreaks [of Ebola] and other diseases and poses the question: "While the world focuses on Ebola, are we guilty of ignoring much bigger killers?"

Analyzing the death rates from different viruses shows Ebola is certainly one of the most deadly infections ever encountered. David Mabey, a professor of communicable diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: "The mortality rate from previous outbreaks is generally over 50 percent in Africa. Very few other viruses approach that, apart from rabies, which is 100 percent and Marburg [a closely related filovirus found in the same region as Ebola], which is in the same ballpark as Ebola."

But just because a virus is deadly does not mean it will cause a large number of deaths. It also has to infect new people. This outbreak has shown Ebola does not spread as quickly as other infectious diseases. The total death toll of a disease depends on the combination of how rapidly a virus spreads and how deadly it is.

"It sounds slightly perverse, but a virus can cause less severe disease, but be a much bigger problem," said Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham. This is based on the "R0," or the basic reproduction value, which represents how many other people an infected person passes their disease onto. The value must be greater than one for a virus to spread, otherwise an outbreak will peter out. It is those [pathogens] that emerge and then spread with ease that pose global threats.

Even at the height of this epidemic, Ebola is far from a major killer in Africa. It takes HIV/AIDS just 2 days to kill as many people as have died in the whole Ebola outbreak so far... - more

[2] Uganda: Trial of early-generation Ebola, Marburg vaccine candidates

Results of an early-stage clinical trial of 2 experimental vaccines against ebolaviruses and marburgviruses [filoviruses closely related to Ebola viruses] -- the 1st to be completed in an African country -- showed that they were safe and induced immune responses in healthy Ugandan adult volunteers. Developed by researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the experimental vaccines (called DNA vaccines) were predecessors to a next-generation candidate vaccine, called the NIAID/GSK Ebola vaccine, which is currently in clinical development. The NIAID/GSK vaccine incorporates Ebola gene segments into a carrier derived from a chimpanzee adenovirus. It is being tested in several Phase 1 clinical trials [trials conducted in a small number of healthy volunteers, to determine safety at various doses] around the world, with larger trials planned for early 2015.

Overall, the immune responses in the Ugandan volunteers were similar to those reported in a trial of these same DNA vaccines that enrolled participants in the United States in 2008. This is important, the researchers noted, because geographically disparate populations can sometimes have differing immune responses to the same vaccine. That North American and East African volunteers responded similarly to the experimental Ebola and Marburg vaccines is encouraging, they added, and information gained from this trial contributed to accelerated development of the current NIAID/GSK Ebola candidate vaccine.

The Ugandan trial began enrolling volunteers at Makerere University Walter Reed Project, Kampala, in 2009. A total of 108 people enrolled in the trial; 18 people received placebo injections, and 3 groups (30 volunteers in each) received Ebola vaccine, Marburg vaccine or both. Participants received 3 injections spaced over 8 weeks, and all volunteers were followed for 2 years after enrollment. Antibody responses in all vaccine groups peaked at 4 weeks after the 3rd inoculation. Antibodies against the Zaire stain of Ebola virus, the strain causing the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa, were seen in 17 volunteers who received the Ebola vaccine alone and in 14 of those who received both vaccines. Researchers also detected responses of the T-cell arm of the immune system in many of the volunteers. T-cells are believed to play an important role in protection against Ebola infection. Both vaccines were well-tolerated.

[A number of vaccine candidates are looking hopeful in the fight against Ebola, although identification of immune correlates of protection remains unknown. The addition of Marburg to the vaccine is a good approach, as the 2 viruses may occur concurrently. For a summary of Ebola vaccines in clinical trial, see Cooper CL & Bavari S.

Soldiers of the 36th Engineer Brigade out of Fort Hood, Texas held a grand opening ceremony of the Ebola treatment unit near Buchanan, Liberia on 22 Dec 2014 as part of Operation United Assistance. The Buchanan ETU [Ebola Treatment Unit] was built by 902nd Engineer Company soldiers who supported 36th Engineer Brigade and handed it over to the International Organization for Migration. The soldiers of the 902nd Engineer Company built the ETU in 22 days. The IOM customized the facility for its needs before opening it to the public.

Dario Gonzalez, a medical director with IOM, and a native of New York City, discussed adjustments made by the IOM of the ETU to enhance their vision of care. The biggest change they made was to reduce the capacity from 100 beds to 50 beds. 1st Lt. Abraham Richardson, a platoon leader for the 902 Engineer Company and a native of Hartland, Maine, said they also received local support and equipment from the community to help build the ETU... - more

[4] Sierra Leone: Ebola survival rate rising in epicentre of the outbreak
Date: Fri 26 Dec 2014

A year into the world's worst outbreak of Ebola, in West Africa, doctors are reporting an encouraging sign: about 70 per cent of patients in a hard-hit area of Sierra Leone now survive. In a letter published online yesterday [25 Dec 2014] by the New England Journal of Medicine, Kathryn Jacobsen of George Mason University in Virginia and other doctors tell of 581 patients taken to an Ebola treatment centre that opened near Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown in late September [2014]. They were given antibiotics, malaria medicines, ibuprofen for pain and fever, intravenous nutrients, anti-nausea medicine and other supportive care.

About 31 per cent died, including 38 people who were dead when they arrived. Among those admitted more recently, since 5 Nov 2014, mortality was less than 24 per cent. That is much lower than the 74 per cent death rate other doctors reported for 106 patients who were treated in the eastern Sierra Leone town of Kenema, in May and June [2014], when some health workers were on strike and response to the outbreak was in crisis mode.

The new results are cause for "cautious optimism" that access to care may be improving survival, said one author of the earlier report, Tulane University's Daniel Bausch, but they were not from a clinical trial or experiment, so the value of any specific treatment was not known. In some previous Ebola outbreaks, survival has improved as time goes on and cases are detected and treated sooner. The pace of this outbreak also has slowed, and there have been far fewer cases than health officials had predicted... - more
