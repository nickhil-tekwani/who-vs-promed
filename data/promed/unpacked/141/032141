Last night 6 more children and an adult were feared to have
contracted _E. coli_ as the outbreak of the deadly bug linked to a
Fife nursery intensified. The total number of clinically confirmed
and suspected cases has now reached 13. At Glasgow's Yorkhill
Hospital, 4 children are being given specialist treatment for kidney
failure, while another child showing what could be early signs of _E
coli_ O157 infection was being cared for at Victoria Hospital in
Kirkcaldy. The other 8 suspected cases were all being allowed to
remain at home under observation.
Health officials said the source of the outbreak had still not been
traced, but added that it appeared likely that contact with an
infected person was the reason -- rather than contaminated food or
water at the Careshare nursery at Lauder College in Dunfermline.
Dr Jackie Hyland, a consultant in public health medicine for NHS
Fife, said "According to evidence and information so far, the source
of the infection does not appear to be food- or water-related." Dr
Hyland said the families of the children involved had asked for no
further information to be released and for their privacy to be
respected "at this difficult, stressful time".
The man in charge of the day-to-day running of the nursery, Jonathan
Bell, the operations director at Careshare, said they were informed
of the suspected _E. coli_ infection in one child who attended the
nursery last Fri, 5 May 2006. The nursery was shut voluntarily by
Careshare on Tue, 9 May 2006 when news emerged of the suspected bug
in 3 toddlers.
