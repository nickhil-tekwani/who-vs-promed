Lumpy skin disease (LSD), an infectious viral disease of cattle and bovine animals, is spreading fast in some districts of Vidarbha and Marathwada, creating panic among dairy farmers. According to the [Maharashtra] state Animal Husbandry department, so far 93 252 infections of the capripoxvirus, which was first detected in the state in Gadchiroli district in April [2020], have been recorded in the state.

The virus causes the development of stiff, round, cutaneous nodules of 2-5 cm in diameter on the skin of the animal, besides causing fever, lesions in the mouth and reduced milk production. The virus strain currently active in Maharashtra is said to have about 20% morbidity and about 1% mortality rate. The state has launched a vaccination programme.

The virus is not zoonotic and doesn't infect humans through consumption of milk or meat. Though it affects the cow and buffalo, however, infection in the latter has been found to be minimal.

As per the state Animal Husbandry department, Chandrapur is the worst affected with 50 419 cases, followed by Nagpur with 12 296 cases so far. Other affected districts in Vidarbha are Gondia (8150), Vardha (3598) and Gadchiroli (1358). In Marathwada, the disease has been detected in Nanded (13 136) and Parbhani (2182) in considerable proportion with a sporadic spread in several other districts.

Of the 93 252 animals infected so far since April [2020], 67 035 have recovered following medical intervention.

Dr. Devendra Jadhav, deputy commissioner of Animal Husbandry (Disease Control), said the department has launched a massive vaccination programme and has so far inoculated 152 000 animals with a goat pox vaccine.

"Soon after the detection in Chandrapur, we had started a vaccination programme in Chandrapur, Gadchiroli and Nagpur. We have 450 000 vaccine doses available. Whenever an infection is detected, we send the vaccine to inoculate the healthy animals to contain the spread," said Jadhav.

He added that the virus is not highly virile, and the mortality rate is also not high. Owing to the spread of the virus to newer areas, an advisory has been issued to dairy farmers enlisting preventive measures that they need to take while rearing the animals.

"Since the virus spreads via insects, it's very important that the sheds are kept insect-free. The animals can be massaged with insect repellents. Apart from this, affected animals have to be kept away from healthy ones and should not be taken away for grazing. Also, once an infected animal is found, cattle in a 5-km (3.1 mi) radius should be inspected and inoculated," said Jadhav.

[India submitted its immediate notification announcing its 1st LSD event on 18 Nov 2019, reportedly started 12 Aug 2019. The report addressed 3 outbreaks, all in India's northeastern state Odisha (referred to as Orissa, the former name for the state, in the OIE report). The outbreak, assumed to be introduced from Bangladesh, has spread since in a southwesterly direction, most probably by movements of infected cattle followed by local spread by vectors. Numerous outbreaks have already been reported, by the media, from the states Kerala, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh and Assam, now followed by Maharashtra. This extensive spread covering vast parts of the Indian subcontinent, from the northeast to the southwest, is yet to be officially reported to the OIE.

OIE's global LSD map, presenting all outbreaks reported since January 2018, is available at https://tinyurl.com/ya6sk6vr (click on the relevant cluster to center, zoom in to the required resolution).

The summer season is considered favorable to the spread of LSD, presenting climatic and ecological conditions favourable to vector amplification. The gaps in activities of veterinary services have been exacerbated by the restriction on movement due to the COVID-19 emergency and may have hampered control efforts leading to further spread of the disease. - Mod.AS
