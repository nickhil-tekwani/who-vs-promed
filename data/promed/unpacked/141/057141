Drug deaths link confirmed
--------------------------
Users injecting into muscle have fallen ill Health experts believe the
illness which has caused 19 deaths among injecting drug addicts in
Scotland and Dublin shares the same cause. The death toll in Glasgow has
risen to 12, with the death of a man four days ago and officials said two
deaths in Aberdeen could also be linked to the illness. The total number
of reported cases in Scotland now stands at 26. In Dublin, 14 addicts
have been afflicted, seven of whom have died.
Public health officials in both countries held a telephone conference at
the weekend, which concluded that the two outbreaks have the same cause.
Dr Laurence Gruer, from Greater Glasgow Health Board, said: "Much of the
evidence points towards the Glasgow cases being caused by a contaminant
of some of the heroin recently available in certain parts of the city.
"From the information we have received from Dublin, the pattern of cases
there seems almost identical."
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta has been called
in to help identify the cause. Tissue specimens have been sent to the
centers and staff have travelled to Glasgow and Dublin to lend their
expertise to the investigation. Dr Joe Barry, from the Eastern Regional
Health Authority in Ireland, said: "We agree that we seem to be dealing
with the same phenomenon in both cities and we very much value our
collaboration with investigators in Scotland. The whole episode
highlights the importance of international networking in general and the
European Communicable Disease Early Warning System in particular."
In Glasgow, 17 of the cases involved women, including eight of the dead.
In Dublin, only three of the cases were women, one of whom died. Health
chiefs in Aberdeen confirmed that they have been investigating whether
two deaths in the city were linked to the mystery illness. A spokeswoman
for Grampian Health Board said public health officials in Aberdeen have
been liaising with colleagues in Glasgow over the matter. The latest
drugs fatality in the north east, a woman believed to be in her mid-20s,
died in Aberdeen Royal Infirmary on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Scottish Executive has launched a website designed to act
as a focal point for efforts to add to the understanding of the nation's
drugs problem. Deputy Justice Minister, Angus MacKay, also announced the
first Scottish study to assess the number of injecting drug users and
gauge the rate of Hepatitis C infection among them.

[This thread is being downgraded to an 'interupted' status until such
time as significant new information comes available. From various sources
we are aware that many parts of the world are now on the alert for
similar situations.
In discussing the present status with Dr. Syed Ahmed in Glasgow on 24 May
2000 no more new cases were being seen so it would certainly appear to
have been a point-source outbreak. He said that they have recovered the
following Bacillus spp from the 60% pure street heroin: Bacillus pumilus,
_B. megaterium_, & _B. coagulans_. One of their lines of thought was that
as the heroin was purer than usual and the extra citric acid needed to
dissolve the drug may be causing the tissue necrosis. However this would
not of itself explain the terminal septicaemia and multiple organ
collapse.
Mogens Jensenius, Oslo, tells me that they had treated a case of
IDU-associated botulism at Aker University Hospital, Oslo, in February
this year. The report was submitted to The Lancet in April as a Case
report. So they had had a confirmed botulism clinical experience prior to
the anthrax death in April. Chances of their confusing cases are
therefore probably nil. - Mod.MHJ
