Anthrax outbreak hits Masvingo
------------------------------
An anthrax outbreak has been detected in several areas in Masvingo rural
district. Farmers in areas such as Mushandike, Nemanwa, Sipambi, and
Manyama confirmed they were living in perpetual fear of losing their cattle
following the detection of anthrax in their areas.

Member of Parliament for Masvingo West constituency, Tachiona Chiminya
Mharadza, said he was running around to try and come up with a quick
solution to rescue the farmers. "Farmers are afraid of losing their cattle
since the detection of anthrax in their area. Most of the peasant farmers
have very little cattle so they are very worried that there is a likelihood
of them losing their cattle. As the MP for the area, I will engage various
stakeholders so that they assist us with vaccines," said Mharadza.

Titus Goronga of Manyama said he had already lost one beast due to the
disease. "I have already lost one beast so far and to me that loss is very
painful because as a family, we rely on cattle for sustenance. We are
appealing to the government and the local authority to help us as a matter
of urgency before we lose all our cattle," said Goronga.

Charity Sibanda, the provincial head of veterinary services in the
province, confirmed the outbreak. She was, however, not in a position to
give details concerning the most affected areas. "We are aware of the
outbreak so as the department we shall do our level best fight the disease.
We are yet to find out the most affected areas," said Sibanda.

Farmers are saying the government is greatly to blame for the outbreak
because of lack of dipping services for the past 18 months.

[It appears that the country is incapable of any structured effective
response. And unfortunately until the country can turn itself around this
will continue and the hole it is in will get only deeper and more expensive
and complex to get out of. - Mod.MHJ
