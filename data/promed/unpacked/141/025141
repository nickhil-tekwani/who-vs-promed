There's important scientific news out of Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton [Ravalli County, Montana]. Scientists have discovered the Bitterroot Valley is home to a tick that carries the bacterium that causes relapsing fever. Relapsing fever is a treatable, acute, usually nonfatal disease that can make patients sick over and over again. If not treated, it can be fatal to the fetus of a pregnant woman.

Dr. Tom Schwan, a Rocky Mountain Laboratories entomologist, took NBC Montana to a high-elevation wooded area on the east side of Corvallis, not far from where a man got relapsing fever in 2013. The man was bitten by a soft tick while working in his woodpile. The soft tick is different from the larger hard-shelled tick that causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever. "You don't pick them up while hiking through the woods," said Schwan. He said the ticks feed much more quickly than the Rocky Mountain spotted fever tick. "Most people don't know when they're being bitten by these ticks," he said.

He said chipmunks and squirrels are hosts to the tick. In 2013, his team of scientists took blood samples from a chipmunk that was trapped near the patient's woodpile. Schwan said that chipmunk was infected with the same bacterium that the man who fell ill was infected with. He said finding the infected chipmunk, plus infected ticks in the woodpile, explained how the patient became sick with tickborne relapsing fever.

Schwan and Missoula physician Dr. Joshua Christensen, who treated the patient, wrote the paper that appears in the scientific journal. Schwan suspected this soft tick was present in the Bitterroot before the man became ill. "These ticks are very hard to find," he said. "They're secretive. They only come out at night."

In 2002, Schwan and his team found soft ticks on Wild Horse Island on Flathead Lake. 5 people attending a family reunion there were bitten by the ticks and came down with relapsing fever. Schwan and his team did a 3-year study there. "We also found evidence of the infection at Yellow Bay near the University's research station," he said.

The ticks may be elusive. But Schwan thinks they are probably native to the Bitterroot. They are widespread across the western United States. Christensen, Schwan and his team made the important discovery that people can acquire tick-borne relapsing fever in the Bitterroot. That has never been recognized in the valley before.

"This is an important bit of evidence," Schwan said, "to help in the future when people get infected with this disease, so they can get the proper diagnosis and prompt treatment with the appropriate antibiotics." The scientist thinks these ticks may be fairly widespread in the valley. He and his team have also found evidence of them in the Lake Como and Westfork areas. Both are in the southern portion of Ravalli County.

"Seminal research on tickborne diseases of humans in North America began more than a century ago with the discovery in 1906 that an illness locally called black measles, which affected persons in the Bitterroot Valley of western Montana, USA, resulted from the bite of a bacteria-infected Rocky Mountain wood tick (1,2). What soon followed was the establishment of a multidisciplinary public health program to control this newly identified disease, now called Rocky Mountain spotted fever, which was caused by _Rickettsia rickettsii_, and a search was conducted for other diseases in nature that resulted from the bite of pathogen-infected ticks. These programs were based at a newly funded state laboratory in Hamilton in the Bitterroot Valley, a facility that was soon incorporated into the US Public Health Service and is now the Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

One of the many diseases studied at the RML since the early 1930s has been tickborne relapsing fever (RML, unpub. data) (3,4). In North America, this zoonosis is associated with 3 species of spirochetes, but most human cases are caused by _Borrelia hermsii_, which is found in scattered foci in the western USA and southern British Columbia, Canada (5,6). The specific vector of this spirochete is the _Ornithodoros hermsi_ tick (7), which is found in higher-elevation coniferous forests where its preferred rodent hosts, primarily squirrels and chipmunks, are also found (6). In spite of the many decades of intensive research on ticks and tickborne diseases in the Bitterroot Valley, the tick _O. hermsi_, the spirochete _B. hermsii_, or an autochthonous human case of relapsing fever has not been observed in this region of Montana, until now. We report a case of tickborne relapsing fever in a person in this region.

Case-Patient
------------
The patient was a previously healthy 55-year-old man who sought care in July 2013 after a week of fevers. He had traveled widely over the previous months, including trips to Antarctica, New Zealand, Spain, Italy, and eastern Washington State, before returning to his home in the Bitterroot Valley of Montana. A week before his symptoms developed, he had moved part of a woodpile and noted rodent feces among the cut logs. He came to the emergency department of a local hospital because of fever, chills, night sweats, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and malaise.

At initial evaluation, he had a temperature of 37.3 degrees C; other vital signs were within reference ranges. Initial laboratory values included mildly increased levels of bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and aspartate aminotransferase, and mild transaminitis with an increased level of alanine aminotransferase. A complete blood showed a low platelet count. Hemoglobin level and leukocyte count were within reference ranges. He was given a presumptive diagnosis of an acute viral infection and discharged from the emergency department.

He returned 2 days later with confusion, tachycardia, hypoxemia, and a measurable fever (temperature 38.7 degrees C). A physical examination identified a bilateral conjunctival suffusion, more notable in the right eye; cervical lymphadenopathy, tachypnea, tachycardia, splenomegaly, and major confusion. Additional laboratory tests showed a leukocyte count of 9400 with 23 percent bands and a further reduced platelet count to 29 000/mL. Levels of bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, serum lactate with lactic acidosis, procalcitonin, and total creatine kinase were all highly increased above reference values. Urinalysis showed a 2+ protein level, and a chest radiograph showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates.

He was admitted to the hospital and given intravenous ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline pending further examination. A peripheral smear was prepared, which showed thrombocytopenia and multiple extracellular spirochetes. A coded diagnostic specimen of the patient's whole blood was sent to the RML for identification of the spirochetes. His hospital course was notable for acute respiratory failure caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome, metabolic encephalopathy, and uveitis of the right eye. His sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome resolved, and his condition rapidly improved after treatment with ceftriaxone and doxycycline. On hospital day 5, he was discharged and given a 14-day course of oral doxycycline.

He was seen as an outpatient and showed resolution of abnormalities and symptoms, except for decreased visual acuity of the right eye that ultimately required a corrective lens. Results of serologic tests performed at a commercial diagnostic laboratory were negative for antibodies against _Coxiella burnetii_, _Brucella_ spp., _Francisella tularensis_, _Leptospira interrogans_, _Treponema pallidum_, hantavirus (Sin Nombre virus), Colorado tick fever virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and hepatitis A, B, and C viruses. An IgM test result for Lyme disease was equivocal but was probably cross-reactive because of the _B. hermsii_ infection. A convalescent-phase serum sample obtained 6 weeks after onset of symptoms was sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Fort Collins, Colorado, USA). This sample was positive for _B. hermsii_ by enzyme immunoassay and Western blotting."

Relapsing fever is tickborne in the USA but may also be louse-borne. Louse-borne disease remains endemic in parts of central and east Africa and the South American Andes. Although the clinical illnesses can be quite similar, the tickborne form is associated with more relapses (as many as 13, but averaging about 3, as compared with the louse-borne form, with as many as 5 but usually only one) and a much lower mortality rate if left untreated (2-5 percent versus as high as 40 percent). In the USA, a majority of the reported cases are from California and Washington state. A 1927 case of relapsing fever diagnosed in Washington state was thought to have been acquired in Montana (1), and soft ticks collected in 1936 in southwestern Montana were found to be able to transmit _B. parkeri_ to mice in the laboratory (2).

Although various species of _Borrelia_ (at least 15) can transmit tickborne disease, it is not entirely clear that in 1936, they could be readily differentiated. More specific serologic identification is now possible (3). It is important to note that only one species, _B. recurrentis_, is associated with the louse-borne form. Unlike hard ticks such as _Dermacentor_ (one of the vectors for Rocky Mountain spotted fever) and _Ixodes_ (Lyme disease), _Ornithodoros_ soft ticks are night feeders, feeding quite quickly (5-20 minutes) and painlessly. Outbreaks of tickborne relapsing fever are often associated with sleeping in cabins.

The diagnosis can be readily made during febrile periods by a Wright stain of the peripheral blood. Without any concentration of blood, as shown in the Emerging Infectious Diseases case above, spirochetes can be seen extracellularly. Unlike other spirochetes, this organism readily picks up the Wright stain. The relapses appear to be caused by changes in the outer protein antigens of the organism. For additional reading on the manifestations of the tickborne form, references 3 and 4 are useful.

Louse-borne relapsing fever has been imported into the USA. In 1976, a case of a woman from Ethiopia was reported from Dayton, Ohio in which the organism was detected in her blood and in lice. It was claimed to have been the 1st case of louse-borne relapsing fever in the USA in the 20th century (5).
