The number of dengue cases in the 9 months to September [2007]
dropped 4.6 percent from the same period last year [2006], the
Department of Health (DoH) said Monday [17 Sep 2007].
In a statement, the DoH's National Epidemiology Center (NEC) said 18
705 dengue cases were recorded from January to September [2007]. A
total of 19 601 cases were recorded during the same period last year [2006].
NEC data showed that while the ages of those stricken with dengue
ranged from 18 days to 98 years old, the bulk of cases -- 77 percent
-- involved people between the ages of one and 20. The [slight]
majority of those affected -- 53 percent -- were male.
No dengue hotspots were identified in the latest NEC data but the
clustering of cases was noted in cities such as Manila, Malabon,
Quezon, Caloocan, Muntinlupa, Paranaque, San Juan, and Valenzuela in
the National Capital Region.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III reminded community officials to
sustain clean-up activities and continue the improvement in the
agency's drive against the disease. "Barangay [village] officials
should not let up in their efforts to rid their communities of
mosquito-breeding places," said Duque in the statement. Duque visited
Barangay 275 in Parola in Binondo on Monday [17 Sep 2007] as part of
the department's dengue inspection. Barangays are expected to remove
non-essential containers in their areas that can hold [water] and
become breeding places of mosquitoes, which carry dengue.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) got it right on Wednesday [19 Sep
2007] when it said in Phuket that we should be taking the 33 percent
jump in the number of reported dengue cases this year [2007] a great
deal more seriously. It also chose the right moment to call for
stricter and more effective control measures before the problem gets
out of hand.
The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, which transmits dengue fever [viruses],
inflicted its misery on 41 975 people between 1 Jan and 8 Sep [2007]
and killed 47 of them, according to the Public Health Ministry's
Disease Control Department. And these are just the cases we know
about. Indonesia has been hardest-hit with over 160 000 cases, while
Burma [Myanmar] has also seen a surge in infections, totalling 11
577. Cambodia has suffered 25 000 cases this year [2007], killing 300
children under 15 -- 3 times the number in all of 2005. Malaysia has
also seen a 50 percent leap in infections, with 56 deaths recorded in
June [2007] and more than 1000 patients admitted to hospital every
week in July [2007], while Viet Nam has seen a 40 percent jump on
last year [2006], with 33 000 people infected and 32 deaths. In fact,
no country in Southeast Asia has been left untouched and the outbreak
threatens to become the worst in a decade.
Some of the blame for this is put on changing climate conditions
which have affected the life cycle of the mosquito carrier, enabling
it to produce a minimum infective dose of the dengue virus faster
than before. Another factor is the increase in travel and migration
of people and animals which has caused a rise in dengue transmission
across international borders and could be why new strains of the
virus have emerged throughout the world [Non-human animals are not
hosts for dengue viruses, with the possible exception of non-human
primates. Therefore, movement of animals is not a factor in rising
dengue virus transmission. Movement of infected mosquitoes could move
dengue viruses across international borders. - Mod.TY]
The major culprit, though, is rapid urbanisation. This is usually
fuelled by growing prosperity, but we have a home-grown problem
rooted in the past. The grim legacy of the 1997 property market
collapse and financial crisis is still visible in the number of
unfinished buildings in central Bangkok. Of the total 508 structures,
only 380 have been re-developed while the remaining 128 have been
left to decay. Despite repeated safety warnings they remain empty and
abandoned. Abandoned that is except for the pools of unsanitary,
stagnant water which have been allowed to build up, providing ideal
conditions for mosquitoes to breed and create a major health hazard.
This pattern is also visible in regular construction sites with every
puddle, old, unused automobile tyre, discarded plastic bag, or
aluminium can [be] a potential breeding ground.
So what hope is there for an end to this scourge? There is no cure
for either dengue fever or the potentially fatal form called dengue
haemorrhagic fever [DHF], which causes internal bleeding and
circulatory collapse. Attempts are being made to develop a vaccine
effective against the 4 serotypes but production is a long way off.
Epidemiologists are working on ways to combat dengue but the only
surefire method of prevention and control is to eliminate the places
where the mosquitoes breed. And that can only work if we all play a part.
Eradicating them in their breeding grounds means emptying pools of
still water, whether in small pots, jars, bottles, and other areas
where they breed. Mosquitoes never breed in moving water so drains
must be kept clear and flowing. Old vehicle tyres must be disposed
of. If pools of still water cannot be emptied, a coat of oil will
kill underwater larvae by depriving them of oxygen. All this is very
difficult to manage in the rainy season but it is the only effective way.
Sale and distribution of mosquito larvae, commonly known as 'luk
nam', for use as fish food must be outlawed and a public awareness
campaign launched. Nor must there be any repetition of the selfish
incident under the previous government when ornamental fish breeders
in Nakhon Pathom physically blocked health workers from spraying,
saying they needed the mosquito larvae as live feed for their fish.
It was no coincidence that Nakhon Chaisri district, where the fish
breeding business is popular and where this occurred, had the highest
incidence of dengue fever in the province that year.
Health officials, much to our disappointment, have not been very
successful in keeping the city clean of mosquitoes. So it is up to us.

The number of dengue cases reported in the 9-15 Sep week [2007] was
203, which is significantly lower than in previous months. But there
were still 29 clusters, which have more than 10 cases each. These
hotspots were located across the island. So the public is advised to
remain vigilant to prevent the _Aedes_ mosquito from breeding.
Bukit Batok remained the worst-hit, with 97 cases reported. Ang Mo
Kio Avenue 4 was also on the black list, with 13 cases.

Dengue is caused by a mosquito called _Aedes aegypti_. In some
countries there are control programmes. In Myanmar, where less than
0.4 percent [of the government's budget] is spent on health care (USD
0.50 per person), there is no such programme. Not surprisingly dengue
outbreaks hit the impoverished country hard and fast.
Throughout Myanmar more than 1000 people a week, most of them
children, were diagnosed with dengue in July [2007], according to
government statistics. However this figure is only for public
hospitals. In Yangon [the capital] alone there are over 1000 private
clinics. One paediatrician who runs a private clinic in Yangon
reported seeing more than 100 children a day in the 1st 10 days of
August [2007]. "I started work every day at 6 am and didn't finish
until 11 pm."
The cost of treating dengue is USD 1.50. The average Myanmar family
makes USD 1.64 a day. But even if a family is able to pay for tests,
the medicines may not be available. One paediatrician who didn't want
to be identified said medicines were not stockpiled in advance for an epidemic.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) held its 1st coordination meeting
on [3 Aug 2007] in Yangon. At around the same time, the UN children's
agency UNICEF started distributing leaflets with information on how
to prevent dengue, identify the symptoms, and what to do at the 1st
sign a child has the disease.
Cases in April and May [2007] were nearly double what they were the
year before [2006], official statistics show. In June [2007], WHO's
regional office reported there was a risk of a major outbreak.
In August [2007], UNICEF received a request from the government for
USD 55 000 to buy pesticides, fumigation equipment, and continue
education campaigns.

[In the last ProMED-MBDS posting on dengue in Myanmar dated 9 Jul
2007, there were reports of 30 deaths out of 3000 cases (see Dengue -
Myanmar (04): RFI 20070709.2177). The newswire above does not provide
specific figures to know what the most recent morbidity and mortality
statistics are in the country with respect to dengue fever. It is
clear from all of the reports to date, that 2007 is a major year for
dengue activity in Southeast Asia, with significant morbidity and
mortality in many of the MBDS countries.
Of note, the newswire above quotes a physician saying that it hasn't
been as bad since the outbreak in 1996. To put this into perspective,
according to the WHO's Southeast Asian Regional Office (SEARO)
statistics, the numbers below represent annual reported cases of
dengue in Myanmar during the period 1996 through 2006 (information
for 2007 was not available as yet -- see
<http://searo.who.int/LinkFiles/Dengue_dengue_updated_tables_06.pdf>).
1996 - 1854 cases / 18 deaths
1997 - 4500 cases / 82 deaths
1998 - 13 002 cases / 211 deaths
1999 - 5828 cases / 88 deaths
2000 - 1884 cases / 14 deaths
2001 - 15 695 cases / 204 deaths
2002 - 16047 cases / 170 deaths
2003 - 7907 cases / 78 deaths
2004 - 7369 cases / 79 deaths
2005 - 17 454 cases / 169 deaths
2006 - 11 383 cases / 128 deaths
The important fact to note is that this is considered to be the worst
year for many years, so that one suspects that the current case load
seen in Myanmar exceeds the 17 454 cases and 169 deaths reported in 2005.
ProMED-MBDS would greatly appreciate information from knowledgeable
sources about the current dengue situation in Myanmar.
