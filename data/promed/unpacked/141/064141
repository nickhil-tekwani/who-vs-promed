The epidemic of [a disease whose symptoms include] abnormal movements
among children of the same area in Sudan is rather surprising. It
seems to be different from classical diseases. Of course, I agree
with colleagues saying that autopsies including a wide-spectrum
search for microbiological or toxic agents would be useful to solve
this mystery.
I would suggest including tests for Whipple's disease, although no
epidemic has been reported previously, to my knowledge. Infection due
to _Tropheryma whippleii_ is soil-transmitted. It can produce
malabsorption, leading to severe impairment to the physical
development of children. In late stages, after years of evolution,
this disease strikes the central nervous system with dementia and
abnormal motions distinct from seizures. Classically, there is no
real meningitis, only a subacute or chronic encephalitis.
It would be of interest to know how the children responded to
antibiotics, such as cotrimoxazole, or even ceftriaxone (if available
locally), which is much more efficient on neuro-Whipple. Hoping that
these ideas could help these unfortunate Sudanese children.

When I heard this story, I was reminded of the strange disease known
as Kuru (shivering) that affected mainly children in the Fore tribe
in Papua New Guinea. Has a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy
been positively ruled out as the cause of this disease?
There is a reference to monkey flesh. Do they eat monkey (meat,
offal, brain)? Monkeys can certainly be infected with TSEs.
Anthropological techniques were invaluable in investigating the cause
of Kuru -- can such techniques help here?

[We thank Dr. Fabrice Simon and Dr. Gerry Bryant for their comments.
Though nothing should be ruled out at this stage, Whipple's disease
in children would be unusual. Treatment with
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is recommended for a year, and a
treatment trial without a more certain diagnosis seems unfeasible.
As alluded to in the comments contained in the previous post, a prion
disease like Kuru or Creutzfeldt-Jakob is a possibility, but such
diseases in humans have a much more rapid course than the prolonged
disease described in the report. A novel prion disease transmitted
from bush meat is a possibility, but we would expect to see cases in
adults as well. Autopsies would tell us whether changes were
compatible with other known prion diseases. - Mod.EP]
