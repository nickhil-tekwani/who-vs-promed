[The following information came from a presentation titled "Information on the implementation of the African swine fever [ASF] programme in 2015" given by the National Sanitary Veterinary and Food Safety Authority of Romania at the PAFF (Plants, Animals, Food and Feed) Committee, 1-2 Jun 2016 Brussels.
(Thanks to Sabine Zentis for the link https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/reg-com_ahw_20160601_pres_africane-swine-fever-romania.pdf)

Information in this presentation noted that:
- Romania was a country at risk as shown by all risk analyses conducted (FAO, CISA/INIA [Spain, centre for research on infectious animal diseases and environmental health]), as well as by one conducted by the Romanian veterinary authorities;
- to its north east, Romania is bordered by the Ukraine and Republic of Moldova [both countries have confirmed cases of ASF. - Mod.CRD];
- 8 counties on its north eastern border are considered high risk: Satu-Mare [where the current outbreak is located], Maramures, Suceava, Botosani, Iasi, Vaslui, Galati, and Tulcea.

Document SANTE/7113/2015 (https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/ad_control-measures_asf_wrk-doc-sante-2015-7113.pdf) summarizes the ASF strategy for the eastern part of the EU. The ASF strategy is directed at the member states recently affected by the disease or which have a higher risk of disease introduction. It is intended to help prevent the spread of the disease, and to help control and eventually eradicate it from the affected territories.

A map showing the outbreaks of ASF reported in the region from 1 Jan 2015 to 31 Jul 2017 can be seen at http://tinyurl.com/y9jhzyvw (click on the section of interest on the map, and zoom in). - Mod.CRD
