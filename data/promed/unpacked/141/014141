When Chobani Greek yogurt consumers complained of stomach problems in September 2013, the company issued a recall, but when symptoms reportedly worsened in healthy people over time, researchers took a closer look. Initially, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) thought the _Mucor circinelloides_ fungus that contaminated the products only sickened those with compromised immune systems, but it wasn't until it started to harm healthy people that researchers decided to take a closer look at the fungal strain and published their findings in the journal mBio.

"When he heard about the Chobani recall after reports of people becoming sick from yogurt contaminated with _Mucor circinelloides_, we thought the _M. circinelloides_ strain could cause more serious problems than one might think," the study's co-author Soo Chan Lee of Duke University said in a press release.

More than 200 Chobani yogurt consumers suffered vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea after consuming yogurts contaminated with the mold. According to the FDA report, illnesses became very severe, and one person experienced "repeated vomiting and diarrhea for 2 entire days and 2 days of missed work," while their spouse only experienced severe diarrhea and nausea for a few days. Researchers obtained the yogurt from the couple's fridge and confirmed the mold, which had previously been thought to pose "little or no risk to consumers," but that was based on an evaluation from the Chobani breakout. It turns out it is capable of causing significant infections and reactions in humans.

Before the outbreak, scientists didn't know the potential harm this fungal strain could inflict on humans. Researchers even tested the particular strain on mice and found it had the ability to cause lethal infections when ingested through the gastrointestinal tract and also when directly injected into the bloodstream.

When Chobani CEO Hamdi Ulukaya was asked in 2013 about the outbreak, he said the voluntary recall "totally fixed" the issue and said the mold became a problem because the company doesn't use preservatives in its products, according to USA Today. Customers described the products as "unnervingly fizzy" and described it as tasting like wine.

"When people think about foodborne pathogens, normally they list bacteria, viruses, and maybe parasites. Fungal pathogens are not considered as foodborne pathogens. However, this incidence indicates that we need to pay more attention to fungi. Fungal pathogens can threaten our health systems as foodborne pathogens," Lee said.

"Food-borne pathogens are ongoing problems, and new pathogens are emerging. The impact of fungi, however, is largely underestimated. Recently, commercial yogurts contaminated with _Mucor circinelloides_ were sold, and greater than 200 consumers became ill with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Mucoralean fungi cause the fatal fungal infection mucormycosis, whose incidence has been continuously increasing. In this study, we isolated an _M. circinelloides_ strain from a yogurt container, and multilocus sequence typing identified the strain as _Mucor circinelloides f. circinelloides_. _M. circinelloides f. circinelloides_ is the most virulent _M. circinelloides_ subspecies and is commonly associated with human infections, whereas _M. circinelloides f. lusitanicus_ and _M. circinelloides f. griseocyanus_ are less common causes of infection.

The yogurt isolate was virulent in murine and wax moth larva host systems. In a murine gastromucormycosis model, Mucor was recovered from fecal samples of infected mice for up to 10 days, indicating that Mucor can survive transit through the GI tract. In interactions with human immune cells, _M. circinelloides f. lusitanicus_ induced proinflammatory cytokines but _M. circinelloides f. circinelloides_ did not, which may explain the different levels of virulence in mammalian hosts. This study demonstrates that _M. circinelloides_ can spoil food products and cause gastrointestinal illness in consumers and may pose a particular risk to immunocompromised patients."

One of the references cited about clinical infections (Singh N, Aguado JM, Bonatti H, et al: Zygomycosis in solid organ transplant recipients: a prospective, matched case-control study to assess risks for disease and outcome. J Infect Dis 2009;200: 1002-1011) actually does not speciate the Mucor isolates, but human infections have been reported.

_Mucor circinelloides_ is a rare cause of human mucormycosis (zygomycosis), a fungal infection that generally manifests in diabetics or in immunocompromised individuals. In one report (Khan ZU, Ahmad S, Brazda A, Chandy R: _Mucor circinelloides_ as a cause of invasive maxillofacial zygomycosis: an emerging dimorphic pathogen with reduced susceptibility to posaconazole. J Clin Microbiol 2009;47: 1244-1248), the authors state (citation numbers removed):

"A review of the literature revealed only 8 cases of zygomycosis in adults caused by _M. circinelloides_. Six of the cases with cutaneous or subcutaneous involvement were either known or suspected to have sustained trauma. Hematological malignancy was the underlying disease in 4 cases (acute myelocytic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome in 2 patients each); one had multiple underlying conditions (insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with metabolic acidosis, alcoholism, cirrhosis, and corticosteroid treatment), and one had short gut syndrome with multiple surgical interventions. Two of the patients had no recognizable underlying condition. Our patient was a 40-year-old man who apparently had no underlying disease except non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, which is a frequently associated condition among patients developing zygomycosis, particularly the rhinocerebral form of the disease. However, diabetes mellitus in our patient was well controlled by oral anti-diabetics, and the patient was apparently healthy and occupationally functional."

Note that the publication mentions that the organism is dimorphic. Indeed, some species of Mucor grow as a yeast under anaerobic conditions, which is unique among the zygomycosis molds (Orlowski M: Mucor dimorphism. Microbiol Rev 1991;55: 234-258.

The pathophysiology of the illnesses associated with the mold-contaminated yogurt is less than clear. Gastrointestinal mucormycosis occurs but is not likely to be self-limited and occurs almost exclusively in immunocompromised hosts. The 200 some odd individuals in this outbreak all had self-limited gastrointestinal symptoms, suggesting that the process was toxin-induced rather than tissue invasion from the mold. This is further underscored in some of the supplemental information in the paper. A note is included (described in the paper) regarding a Texas couple who ingested the yogurt after it was combined in a casserole as a "healthier" sour cream substitute, and the casserole was cooked at 350 F [176.6 C] for at least 30 minutes. This additionally suggests that the mediator of symptoms may have been a toxin that was heat stable. No information seems to be available regarding the incubation period of illness after ingestion or whether fever was present. - Mod.LL
