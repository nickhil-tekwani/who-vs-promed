Blight outbreak hits J&K farmers
--------------------------------
Bhisham Das, 80, is trying to come to terms with the loss he suffered after
his potato crop was completely ruined by blight. For several years, farmers
in the border areas could not grow anything because of the intermittent
firing between Indian and Pakistani forces. The army's de-mining operations
further impeded their work. Now when the fields could finally be
cultivated, crops have been hit by the deadly disease. "After the
cease-fire, we sowed potatoes and thought that we will get a good crop, but
that was not to be," said Das. Another farmer, Joginder Pal, has resorted
to spraying his fields in the hope of saving any potatoes untouched by
blight. He blames the seeds for the disease. "The gave us the seed of
Himachal, which is a sub-standard seed. We were kept in the dark. They had
told us that they will give us good seeds, but they didn't keep the
promise. We could not even get back the money that we had invested," said
Pal. Meanwhile, the department of agriculture has blamed the weather for
the plight of the farmers. The seeds, it says, were fine.
The department has proposed that from next year [2007] the potato crop be
brought under crop insurance in the state. But for now, the department is
trying to provide some interim relief by further subsidizing fertilizers
and new seeds. "I have no agreement with the farmers to provide
compensation. But at the same time, we can give relief, and if the
government has some package, we will try and give them relief," said Farooq
Hakak, director of agriculture, Jammu.
For farmers in the Valley already dealing with war, firing, mines and
earthquake, this has come as yet another setback.

[The crop plant potato (_Solanum tuberosum_) develops symptoms of the
disease late blight when infected by the fungus _Phytophthora infestans_.
Late blight is one of the main diseases of potato worldwide.
The Kashmir town of Srinagar and the surrounding areas are routinely
troubled by border issues between India and Pakistan and were severely
affected by the earthquake of October 2005. The 300 km long Srinagar-Jammu
national highway, the only road link between Kashmir valley and the rest of
the country, was reopened for traffic in February 2006. This article puts a
human face on plant diseases, and it was for this reason that I chose it.
It speaks for itself.
