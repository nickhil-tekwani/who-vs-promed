[The updated summary of the current Hungarian BTV event, since its start (9 Sep 2015), is, according to OIE, as follows:
Total outbreaks = 28 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases
Cattle / 4778 / 64
Sheep / 950 / 2

Links to the 6 reports submitted as of 26 Oct 2015 and an interactive map showing the locations of the 28 outbreaks are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=18625. The map demonstrates the wide spread of the disease in Hungary, mainly in the south, but reaching also Slovakia's border in the north.

Though according to an earlier media report, BTV serotype 4, confirmed in bordering Romania, was reportedly circulating in Hungary as well (see 20151014.3715855), this has not been, so far, officially confirmed: all of Hungary's 5 follow-up reports, including the current one, refer to the serotype as "pending". However, the report mentions "vaccination in response to the outbreak" as being applied. Does this refer to vaccine BTV-4? Final information on serotyping results is anticipated. - Mod.AS
