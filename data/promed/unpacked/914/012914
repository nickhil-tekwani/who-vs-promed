A person died while 2 others were reportedly affected in a suspected breakout of anthrax at Munda Jhola village under this block in Koraput district [Sun 26 Mar 2017]. The deceased was identified as [BS] while the affected were [S, 40] and [S, 45] of the same village. The incident triggered panic in the village. Locals claimed that [B's] hands and legs swelled with blisters all over his body. He suffered severe pain and arson [?] and succumbed to the disease.

Soon, the disease affected [B's] neighbours [S and S], locals said. Family members admitted them to the local community health centre (CHC) after blisters were seen on their bodies. They experienced itching on their body parts which soon led to blisters and later their limbs started swelling. They underwent treatment and their condition remained critical while this report came in.

Earlier, the disease had claimed many lives in the neighbouring K Donda Bado village. Many cattle also lost their lives due to the disease, locals said. They feared that the disease would spread to nearby villages as no members from a medical team had visited the village after the breakout of the disease. Locals demanded that a medical team visit the village and administer necessary vaccines and preventive medicines. "A medical team will visit the village and take necessary steps," said CHC officer Amita Tiga, adding that the locals should refrain from eating meat of dead animals and birds. She also asked locals not to allow their cattle to graze until the disease was tackled.

For a description and map of Koraput, go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koraput Koraput is one of the southernmost municipalities of Odisha state.

This is labeled "suspect" merely because there is no record of laboratory confirmation, whether of the humans or from examination of this "rotten beef."

This is a bad anthrax season for Odisha with outbreaks in the north and the south. As subscribers may have appreciated by now, trying to persuade villagers to not slaughter and butcher sick cows is exceptionally difficult. Frankly, it is more cost effective to have annual livestock vaccination in areas with a history of repeated outbreaks. Dead cows are a significant financial loss to affected families and treating human cases, especially when hospitalised, is not cheap either. But the vaccine [veterinary] is cheap, globally one of the cheapest, costing pennies, but still most effective vaccines available. Plus the veterinary presence, even if a matter of hours, increases the confidence in their services and the sharing of information, which of itself increases the long-term efficiency of any visit.

Medical teams do not have the necessary Sterne livestock vaccine. This is a veterinary responsibility. Yes, you can vaccinate humans but the human vaccines are very expensive, not as effective, and necessitate multiple shots to have any impact. Unfortunately anthrax antibodies are temporary, even in response to a clinical exposure, which is another reason why a proactive veterinary control programme is necessary; but it is very cost effective. - Mod.MHJ]
