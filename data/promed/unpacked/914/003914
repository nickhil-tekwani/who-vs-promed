[2] Response to RFI
Date: Mon 17 Mar 2014
From: Robert Roos <bobroos@umn.edu> [edited]


In response to today's [17 Mar 2014] ProMED-mail post and RFI concerning MERS-CoV cases in Saudi Arabia, I'd like to point out that the [12 Mar 2014] WHO update on MERS-CoV cases was revised a day or 2 after it was posted. The original version cited cases in a 51-year-old man and a 56-year-old woman, both from Riyadh. The revised version (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2014_03_12/en/) mentions a 55-year-old man from Riyadh instead of the 56-year-old woman; it includes a footnote about this correction.
