According to the Chuysk sanitary epidemiological surveillance center,
on 14 Feb 2004 botulism was discovered in a 25-year-old woman in the
city of Kara-Balta in the Chuysk region. The woman is in her 6th
month of pregnancy. She had consumed preserved tomatoes and smoked
sausage. The last case of botulism during pregnancy was recorded
there 10 years ago.

[There is not a lot of published information regarding botulism
during pregnancy. 2 reports concern botulism during the 3rd
trimester. In one example in the pediatric literature (1), although
the pregnancy was complicated by a placental abruption (early
separation of the placenta from the uterus), the infant had no
evidence of botulism. In another (2), the infant of a substance
abuser with wound botulism was delivered at 34 weeks and required
several weeks of intensive care; but the report does not state if the
infant was indeed affected by botulism. 2 other reports described
intoxication during the 2nd trimester (3, 4). In both, despite the
need for respiratory support of the mother, ultrasound examination of
the fetus found normal movement and development and resulted in
full-term, healthy infants. A relatively large molecule, botulinum
toxin does not seem to passively diffuse across the placenta (3).
