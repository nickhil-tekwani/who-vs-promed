Cholera outbreak in Hispaniola #10 - 22 Dec 2022
------------------------------------------------
In Haiti, as of [20 Dec 2022], the Department of Epidemiology, Laboratories, and Research (DELR) reports 18 469 suspected cholera cases in all 10 departments of the country since the first cases were reported on [2 Oct 2022]. Of these, 1380 cases have been confirmed in 9 departments, of which 1024 (74.2%) of were reported in the Ouest Department, followed by 157 in Centre, 60 in Sud Est, and 54 in Artibonite.

In Haiti, high levels of insecurity and limited access to populations continue to be major challenges in the response to the cholera outbreak.

In Haiti, PAHO/WHO continues to support the Ministry of Health (Ministère de la Santé Publique et de la Population - MSPP) and partners, including:
- strategic and technical support for the implementation of the first phase of the cholera vaccination campaign with more than 1 170 000 doses, which began on [18 Dec 2022] in Ouest and Centre Departments;
- technical and logistical support to field investigations in all departments, strengthening completeness and quality of data and transportation of samples;
- distribution of cholera kits and other essential supplies by air and land to ensure quality management of cases at cholera treatment centers (CTCs) and oral rehydration points (ORPs) in 9 departments.

In the Dominican Republic, 6 new cholera cases (all male between 4-49 years old) have been confirmed in Santo Domingo in addition to the 2 imported cases from Haiti reported in October and November [2022], bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 8. PAHO/WHO is providing technical and logistic support to the Ministry of Health in monitoring, investigating, and responding to cholera alerts, including prevention activities through risk communication and community engagement.

Reemergence of cholera in Haiti
-------------------------------
Cholera was absent from Haiti until an inadvertent introduction by UN security forces in [October 2010]. The ensuing epidemic sickened 820 000 people and caused 9792 reported deaths [1]. The last confirmed cholera case in Haiti was recorded in [January 2019], and in [February 2022], cholera was declared to have been eliminated in Haiti [2]. In late [September 2022], a new outbreak began in Port-au-Prince and rapidly expanded to include 11 953 suspected cases by late November 2022, more than 1000 of which were confirmed by culture [3]. We conducted a genomic and phenotypic analysis of the _Vibrio cholerae_ isolated from a stool specimen obtained on [30 Sep 2022], from an index patient -- a child who presented with watery diarrhea and severe dehydration -- to begin to address the origins of the epidemic.

The 2022 _V. cholerae_ isolate shares phenotypes with the [2010] outbreak strain. Both strains are _V. cholerae_ serogroup O1 (El Tor biotype) of the Ogawa serotype and have similar antimicrobial resistance profiles, including resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and low-level resistance to ciprofloxacin (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org [for tables and figures, see original URL - Mod.LL]). This resistance profile is consistent among 130 isolates from the current outbreak, which suggests that the strain that was isolated from the index patient is representative of the ongoing epidemic.

To decipher the relationship between the current outbreak strain and other toxigenic O1 El Tor strains from the ongoing 7th pandemic of cholera, we sequenced the isolate obtained on [30 Sep 2022], along with 4 isolates obtained in 2021 and 2022 from Dhaka, Bangladesh (Table S2). Phylogenetic analysis of more than 1200 isolates revealed that the [2022] Haiti isolate was closely related to the 2010 Nepal isolate that was the origin of the initial outbreak. The 2022 isolate belongs to a subclade of Haiti _V. cholerae_ isolates that originated in [2013] during the previous epidemic and is divergent from [2013] strains from Mexico that were thought to have spread from Haiti, as well as from currently circulating Bangladesh isolates. Haiti isolates from [2022] and [2010] have identical ctxB (ctxB7) and other virulence factors (Table S3) and produce similar quantities of cholera toxin (Figure 1).

These analyses suggest that the reemergence of cholera in Haiti in [2022] was caused, at least in part, by a descendant of the _V. cholerae_ strain that caused the [2010] epidemic. However, no cases of cholera were confirmed between [2019] and [2022], despite ongoing surveillance. Several explanations for the recrudescence of this strain are possible. The first is that toxigenic _V. cholerae_ O1 persisted in Haiti through subclinical infections in humans and has recurred in the context of waning population immunity coupled with a crisis in lack of clean water and sanitation. Another nonexclusive possibility is that this _V. cholerae_ strain has persisted in environmental reservoirs. Finally, because the [2010] outbreak in Haiti was ultimately transmitted to other countries in Latin America [4], a 3rd potential explanation is that the current strain could have been reintroduced to Haiti from a nearby country; however, this explanation is less likely than the others, given the phylogenetic evidence and the absence of recent cholera cases in the region. These findings, along with the resurgence of cholera in several parts of the world [5] despite available tools to fight it, suggest that cholera control and prevention efforts must be redoubled.

[In the wake of the devastation caused by the earthquake on 12 Jan 2010 that centered about 10 miles about 15 km) south west of Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, cholera erupted prominently with more than 820 000 cases and almost 10 000 deaths. After several years, the number of cases lessened but flared in times of stress, including hurricanes.

The social and economic crises have continued and along with gang violence, a resurgence of the waterborne scourge has recurred. ProMED awaits more information regarding this cluster. It will be interesting to see how closely the newly found bacteria are related to the previous outbreak strain.

A genetic analysis of the current outbreak strain is presented above. - Mod.LL]
