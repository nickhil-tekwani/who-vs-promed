It's officially an outbreak. There are more West Nile [virus infection, WNV] cases in southern Nevada this year [2019] than ever before, and mosquito season is far from over. There's no clear-cut answer as to why it's so bad this year [2019], but out of the nearly 40 000 mosquitoes the Southern Nevada Health District has tested all across the valley, 20% are carrying the virus.

"So think about that: one in every 5 mosquitoes is carrying a virus," said Devin Raman, MPH, a senior disease investigation and intervention specialist in the Office of Epidemiology with the Southern Nevada Health District. Raman said the district has confirmed 28 cases so far this season, more than most other states. "There are people at all levels of illness that we know are not reported to us."

West Nile causes flu-like symptoms, which is why Raman said many cases go unconfirmed. But 17 cases in southern Nevada have presented as a more serious neuroinvasive form of the disease. "The virus actually gets up into the brain and the spinal cord, and it causes things like meningitis and encephalitis. It can cause paralysis," Raman said.

So where are the mosquitoes coming from?

"Mosquitoes are terrible fliers. One hundred yards [about 90 meters] is a long way for them to go, so if you have mosquitoes, they're local," said Allen Gibbs, a UNLV professor who studies insects in the School of Life Sciences. Gibbs said mosquitoes have a lifespan of about a month, and it doesn't take much for them to move in. "Just this much water, and you can grow mosquitoes, so if you overwater your plants and leave standing water, you can be a mosquito farmer," he said.

But according to the Southern Nevada Health District, why so many [mosquitoes] are carrying this potentially deadly virus is hard to predict from one year to the next, because West Nile is carried in by migratory birds, which the mosquitoes feed on.

What can you do?

You've heard it before. Spray where you can with DEET, remove all standing water, and cover up with long sleeves and pants when outside.

[This report raises 2 interesting questions. How many human WNV infections are there in southern Nevada? As the report indicates, the 28 confirmed cases are doubtless an underestimate of the total number of human WNV cases there. The USA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that about one in 5 people who are infected develop a fever and other symptoms. About one out of 150 infected people develop a serious neuroinvasive disease, which is sometimes fatal (https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/). That suggests there were more than 4000 infected individuals.

The 2nd question is this. Is there a larger-than-usual number of mosquitoes and susceptible bird hosts? Nevada is the state with the lowest rainfall in the USA. Las Vegas, in southern Nevada, so far in 2019 has received 17 mm [0.67 in] of rain in May (usual mean amount is 3 mm [0.12 in]), none in June (usual 2 mm [0.08 in]), and 20 mm [0.79 in] in July (usual 10 mm [0.39 in]). Perhaps the unusually high amounts of rainfall in May and July, in addition to an accumulation of water used to water gardens, has provided above-average breeding sites for mosquitoes. No information is provided about susceptible bird populations this summer, but it is obviously sufficient to infect one in 5 mosquitoes.

Although there is a vaccine available for equine animals, no vaccine for humans is available. People in southern Nevada should heed the advice offered above and avoid mosquito bites, because that is the only way to prevent WNV infection. - Mod.TY
