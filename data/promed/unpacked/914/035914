[The graphs of the epidemic curves indicate that the peak number of cases nationally has passed. However, the Lassa fever period can be expected to continue for another 2-3 months into June 2018. New cases have occurred over the past few days in several states. Providing adequate surveillance and timely treatment over such a large geographic area is challenging. Fortunately, there is international help participating in treatment and surveillance.

The maps and graphs in the above report are interesting and provide a good picture of how the outbreak has progressed over time. They can be accessed at the above URL.
