More dead birds infected with West Nile virus have been found in San
Diego County. It's the earliest time of the year the disease has ever
been detected here.

In January [2008], a red-tailed hawk was found in Escondido with West
Nile virus. Since then, the disease has been detected in at least 5
other birds in various parts of the County.

Chris Conlan with the San Diego County's vector control division says
he can't really account for the early appearance of West Nile [virus
transmission] this year [2008]. He adds, "West Nile [virus] hasn't
been here all that long; it's still a relatively new disease. And
this just could be a sign of what happens after it's gotten
established in an area for a while. But honestly, I don't really know."

Last year [2007] in San Diego County, 15 people became infected with
West Nile virus. Statewide in 2007, the disease sickened 380 people,
and killed 20.

A bird infected with West Nile virus has been found in Bakersfield --
more than 2 months before the 1st bird was found last year [2007],
according to the county Department of Public Health Services.

"This kicks off the West Nile virus season for us," Public Health
Services Director John Nilon said Tuesday [25 Mar 2008]. "It's
serious. It has started." The finding means the public should start
taking precautions against the mosquito-borne virus, Nilon said. He
didn't know where in the city the bird was found. Nilon found out
about the bird at about noon from the state Department of Public
Health, he said.

Kern's 1st infected bird in 2007 was found the week of 8 Jun.

Despite the early occurrence, it's still hard to predict what the
discovery means for the rest of the season, Nilon said.

"I've talked to a lot of entomologists up at the state," he said.
"And there's no bellwether signal that says to us, 'raise the red
flags. It's going to be a bad year.'"

At this time last year [2007], many health experts were predicting
Kern would have a light West Nile season, Nilon pointed out. But last
year's season ended up putting Kern at the top of lists in the state
and nation with 140 people infected and 4 deaths.

"Kern's bird finding might also be a result of people being more
alert when it comes to reporting birds to the state," he said. "Last
year [2007] people weren't as in tune with reporting the dead birds,"
he said. "We may have had [dead] birds at the same time last year."

So far 9 birds have been found statewide, with the other birds coming
from Los Angeles, Sacramento, and San Diego, according to the state
Department of Public Health.

The virus has not infected any humans or horses this year [2008] in
California. [It would be more accurate to say that no clinical cases
of West Nile (WN) virus infection have been detected and reported.
Most WN virus infections are mild or subclinical, and are not
diagnosed or reported. - Mod.TY]
