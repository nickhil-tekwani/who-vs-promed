This season's flu vaccine may not be as effective against new and possibly more virulent strains of the virus that could become the nation's dominant form of influenza in the young flu season. The emergence of a mutated flu virus has caused the [US] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] to issue a national health advisory urging caregivers to prescribe the antiviral medications Tamiflu and Relenza to suspected flu patients, even before they've been confirmed to have the virus.

Although flu activity has been relatively mild in the US [and elsewhere] thus far, the influenza A virus, known as H3N2, has been seen in most states. "We know that in seasons when H3 viruses predominate, we tend to have seasons that are worse flu years with more hospitalizations from flu and more deaths from influenza. The rate of hospitalization and death can be twice as high or more," said CDC Director Tom Frieden in a conference call with reporters.

So far this season, 5 children have died from the flu, and outbreaks have occurred in schools and nursing homes, Frieden said. Testing has found that 52 percent of more than 1100 H3N2 virus samples were found to be antigenetically different, or "drifted," from the H3N2 virus used in this year's [2014] flu vaccine, Frieden said.

"They're different enough that we're concerned that protection from vaccination against the drifted H3N2 viruses may be lower than we usually see," Frieden said. "These changes can signal that the immune response provided by vaccination won't protect as well for these viruses."

Despite the prospect of lower protection rates, Frieden said vaccination is still the best protection against the flu "and may have some effectiveness against the drifted strain."

To fight complications from the flu, Frieden said antiviral medications, which shorten the duration and severity of flu symptoms, are an "important 2nd line of defense," particularly for people who are at high risk of serious flu complications. This includes children under age 2, adults 65 and older, people with chronic pulmonary and cardiovascular problems and those with neurologic and immunosuppressant disorders. It also includes pregnant and postpartum women, people under age 19 who are on long-term aspirin therapy, American Indians, the morbidly obese and nursing home and chronic-care facility residents.

Antivirals are most effective when taken within 48 hours of the onset of flu symptoms. But fewer than one in 6 flu patients actually get the drugs, Frieden said. "It's very important that we do better. We need to get the message out that treating early with these drugs can make a difference between having a milder illness or a very severe illness," Frieden said. Many doctors don't prescribe antivirals because they mistakenly believe that patients must 1st be tested for the virus.

The drifted viruses were 1st detected in March [2014]. Frieden said their emergence could have resulted from their attempts to escape the immunity being developed by widespread vaccination. The drifted viruses became prominent in September [2014] when it was too late to include them in this year's vaccine formula. It takes 4 months to make the vaccine. "Up until now, there's been so little activity it was hard to say that this virus was going to be of public health importance or not," said Dr. Joseph Bresee of CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. "I think now, with the increasing cases of flu, and (the fact) that this virus is maintaining a presence and maintaining a prevalence in the United States, we felt it necessary to come out and talk about it a little bit." Currently, 4 different strains of flu are circulating in the US, and "only time will tell which of them, if any, will predominate for the following weeks and months of this year's flu season," Frieden said.

The flu vaccine provides protection against several of the virus strains and may provide partial protection against the drifted strains, Frieden said. About 146 million doses of the vaccine have been distributed in the US and there is no shortage.

Early Data Suggests Potentially Severe Flu Season
CDC Urges Vaccination, Treatment
--------------------------------
Early data suggests that the current 2014-2015 flu season could be severe. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) urges immediate vaccination for anyone still unvaccinated this season and recommends prompt treatment with antiviral drugs for people at high risk of complications who develop flu.

So far this year, seasonal influenza A H3N2 viruses have been most common. There often are more severe flu illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths during seasons when these viruses predominate. For example, H3N2 viruses were predominant during the 2012-2013, 2007-2008, and 2003-2004 seasons, the 3 seasons with the highest mortality levels in the past decade. All were characterized as "moderately severe."

Increasing the risk of a severe flu season is the finding that roughly half of the H3N2 viruses analyzed are drift variants: viruses with antigenic or genetic changes that make them different from that season's vaccine virus. This means the vaccine's ability to protect against those viruses may be reduced, although vaccinated people may have a milder illness if they do become infected. During the 2007-2008 flu season, the predominant H3N2 virus was a drift variant yet the vaccine had an overall efficacy of 37 percent and 42 percent against H3N2 viruses.

"It's too early to say for sure that this will be a severe flu season, but Americans should be prepared," said CDC director Tom Frieden, M.D., M.P.H. "We can save lives with a 3-pronged effort to fight the flu: vaccination, prompt treatment for people at high risk of complications, and preventive health measures, such as staying home when you're sick, to reduce flu spread."

Depending on the formulation, flu vaccines protect against 3 or 4 different flu viruses. Even during a season when the vaccine is only partially protective against one flu virus, it can protect against the others.

"While the vaccine's ability to protect against drifted H3N2 viruses this season may be reduced, we are still strongly recommending vaccination," said Joseph Bresee, M.D., Chief of the Influenza Epidemiology and Prevention Branch at CDC. "Vaccination has been found to provide some protection against drifted viruses in past seasons. Also, vaccination will offer protection against other flu viruses that may become more common later in the season."

Influenza viruses are constantly changing. The drifted H3N2 viruses were 1st detected in late March 2014, after World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations for the 2014-2015 Northern Hemisphere vaccine had been made in mid-February [2014]. At that time, a very small number of these viruses had been found among the thousands of specimens that had been collected and tested.

A committee of experts must pick which viruses to include in the vaccine many months in advance in order for vaccine to be produced and delivered in time for the upcoming flu season. There is always the possibility that viruses will drift during that time.

Influenza activity is currently low in the United States as a whole, but is increasing in parts of the country. "We are just at the beginning of the season. It's not too late to get your vaccine," Dr. Frieden says.

Influenza antiviral drugs - Tamiflu (oseltamivir) and Relenza (zanamivir) can reduce severe complications such as hospitalization and potentially death for people who are at high risk of serious flu complications or are very sick. Treatment of high risk patients should begin as soon after symptoms develop as possible, without waiting for lab tests to confirm flu infection.

Those at high risk from influenza include children younger than 5 years (especially those younger than 2 years); adults 65 years and older; pregnant women; and people with certain chronic health conditions such as asthma, diabetes, heart or lung disease, and kidney disease.

CDC recommends that people at high risk check with their doctor or other health care professional promptly if they get flu symptoms. Studies show that flu antiviral drugs work best for treatment when they are started in the first 48 hours after symptoms appear. Flu symptoms can include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue.

[Seasonal flu vaccines have rarely been perfect matches and Dr Frieden's statements seem unnecessarily alarmist. Current methodology does not enable seasonal influenza vaccines to be modified and produced in quantity during the course of an outbreak. Nor is it certain at this stage that H3N2 virus will be the predominant influenza virus causing disease in the 2014-15 winter epidemic which has barely begun in North America, and may take a different course elsewhere.

If correctly reported, the recommendation for early and indiscriminate use of anti-neuraminidase drugs seems likely to result in the evolution of drug resistant variants. - Mod.CP
