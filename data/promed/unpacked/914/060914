[A 22 Jul 2022 report indicated that the "Danish biotechnology company Bavarian Nordic (BAVA.CO) said on Friday [22 Jul 2022] the European Union's drug regulator had recommended its Imvanex vaccine be approved to also include protection against monkeypox on its label....Bavarian's vaccine, the only one to have won approval for the prevention of monkeypox disease in the United States and Canada, has in the EU so far only been approved to treat smallpox. But the company has supplied the vaccine to several EU countries during the current monkeypox outbreak for what is known as 'off-label' use.

"'The extension of the label will help to improve access to the vaccine throughout Europe and strengthen the future preparedness against monkeypox,' Bavarian CEO Paul Chaplin said in a statement" (https://reut.rs/3PSXp92).

The number of confirmed cases of monkeypox in Ireland is 85, according to the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC). The 1st Irish case of the disease was confirmed in the east of the country in May [2022].

Speaking on his way into Cabinet this morning, the Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said public health experts are watching the situation closely and extra vaccines have been procured. He said the advice he is getting is that "this is not COVID, this is very different." Minister Donnelly said it is being taken seriously, but that "this is not in the realm of infectious disease that we've been dealing with for some time."

It was announced this week that the smallpox vaccine would be extended in Ireland to people at high risk of monkeypox exposure. The vaccine will be offered to gay and bisexual men, other men who have sex with men, as well as others at high risk of unprotected exposure. The National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) has recommended that 2 doses of the smallpox vaccine should be administered 28 days apart to as many high-risk individuals as soon as practicable.

NIAC Director Dr Lucy Jessop said today [27 Jul 2022] that monkeypox is a disease that is caught through close contact and has only recently started circulating in a multi-country outbreak. Speaking on RTÉ's Morning Ireland, she said close contacts in Ireland have already received vaccinations. Dr Jessop said NIAC is currently working on plans to give the vaccine pre-exposure to high-risk groups.

It comes as the European Medicines Agency confirmed that its Emergency Task Force (ETF) is being formally extended to deal with both COVID-19 and monkeypox. It stated: "In relation to the monkeypox outbreak, the ETF was already activated to discuss the treatments and vaccines available, and the possible medical countermeasures. The ETF's composition will be reviewed and formally approved by EMA's Management Board, taking into account specific expertise relevant to the therapeutic response to the monkeypox outbreak. The tasks of the ETF will then be formally expanded to cover monkeypox."

The EMA said there are currently 2 medicinal products authorised specifically for monkeypox in the EU. "The medicine Tecovirimat SIGA is authorised for use to treat smallpox, monkeypox and cowpox. The vaccine Imvanex is authorised to protect adults against smallpox and monkeypox."
