The H5N1 bird flu virus in Indonesia may have undergone a mutation that
allows it to jump more easily from poultry to humans, the head of the
country's commission on bird flu control said on Wednesday [6 Jun 2007].
Indonesia has recorded 79 human deaths from bird flu, the highest in the
world, and the country has been struggling to contain the disease because
millions of backyard chickens live in close proximity to humans across the
archipelago. "In the past, it took exposure of high intensity and density
to the virus to get infected. There are now suspicions, early indications
that this has become easier," Bayu Krisnamurthi [chief executive, Indonesia
National Committee for Avian Influenza Control and Pandemic Influenza
Preparedness-KOMNAS FBPI] told reporters. He said, however, that the
suspicion had yet to be confirmed.
Wayan Teguh Wibawan, a microbiologist at the bird flu commission, told
Reuters the suspicions were based on preliminary findings of molecular
genetic tests conducted at laboratories in Indonesia. "Virus samples from
poultry cases have increasingly shown a similarity in their amino acid
structure to virus samples extracted from humans. This makes it easier for
the virus to attach to human receptors," he said, referring to receptor
cells lining the human throat and lungs. For the H5N1 virus to pass easily
from bird to human, it would have to be able to readily attach itself to
these special cells. For the moment, because H5N1 is a bird virus, it has
evolved to easily attach to these receptors in poultry.
Humans have a different type of receptor site, making it harder for people
to become infected. Wayan said he had spotted "gradual changes" in the
virus samples he receives every month. He did not give details on these
gradual changes.
Lo Wing-lok, an infectious disease expert in Hong Kong, said changes such
as these demonstrated how important it was for Jakarta to share virus
samples. "Are they going to share these samples with overseas labs? These
must be confirmed and the world must be forewarned if there has been such
an important change," Lo told Reuters in Hong Kong. "If there is such a
change, it would not only mean that the virus can jump more easily from
bird to man, but from human to human, too."
Bird flu is endemic in poultry in many parts of Indonesia. Scientists are
worried about the virus's persistence and ability to adapt to new
environments and hosts, fearing this increases the chances of the virus
mutating into a form that can jump easily between people, triggering a
pandemic.
Contact with sick fowl is the most common way humans become infected with
bird flu. Krisnamurthi said lack of medical facilities and late
intervention were to blame for a recent surge in deaths in Indonesia
because new cases have mostly occurred in remote areas. Bird flu is often
mistaken for seasonal influenza, which in most cases has led to delayed
hospitalisation.
There have been 188 deaths globally from H5N1 and 310 known infections in
total, according to data from WHO. Sharing samples is deemed vital to see
if viruses have mutated, become drug-resistant or grown more transmissible.
The samples are also used to develop commercial vaccines. Indonesia said
last month [May 2007], it had resumed sharing samples with the WHO after a
5 month hiatus. Along with other developing nations, Indonesia has been
demanding guarantees that they will have access to affordable vaccines in
the event of a pandemic.
