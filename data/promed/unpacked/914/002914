The company Wimm-Bill-Dann [WBD] (owned by PepsiCo), one of the leading manufacturers of dairy products in the Russian Federation, withdrew from the market all dairy products distributed by its holding company Opole, Interfax noted from the Communications Director of WBD, Marina Zibareva. According to her, it was done on the recommendation of Rospotrebnadzor, which said: remove dairy products, which has been produced by the Opole [milk processing plant] between 1 and 19 Oct 2016. This is due to the outbreak of FMD [foot-and-mouth disease] in one of the farms of the Vladimir region, which supplied the milk for processing.

"In addition, immediately after receiving information about foot-and-mouth disease, Opole stopped buying milk in this region," said Zibareva. At the same time, she reported that the share of the supplier of the Vladimir region accounted for only 6-7 tons of milk per day. All in all, Opole processes 220-230 tons of milk per day.

Zibareva stressed that the decision on the withdrawal of the product was made despite the fact that the company is confident in the quality of its products. "This belief is based on the fact that the processing involves only safe raw milk, which is accompanied by a veterinary certificate certifying that the milk was derived from healthy cows, and on the fact that all raw milk undergoes thermal treatment, which guarantees the destruction of the FMD virus. The company has a strict control quality of incoming raw materials and finished products," she explained.

The decision on the withdrawal concerns only a limited range of products, manufactured by "Opole" for the period from 1 to 19 Oct 2016, and has not been extended to other of the company's products. According to the letter of Rospotrebnadzor in Moscow, which was sent to trade organizations, it referred to the total withdrawal of almost 3.8 thousand tons of production in that period. We are talking about yogurt, drinking milk, soured milk. The letter to WBD retailers specifies that this is a product under the brand name "The House in the Village."

Rospotrebnadzor also recommended that the seized products are put under isolated storage.

As reported, the outbreak of FMD was discovered in a farm located in the village Vyshmanovo in the Vladimir region. It contained 800 heads of cattle. The causes of infection are currently under investigation by law enforcement. The village has been subject to quarantine. All economic ties with the village have been stopped. Entry and exit are allowed through traffic control posts.

In the area, an increased control upon the movement of meat and dairy products has been introduced, and all cattle are being vaccinated.

Foot-and-mouth disease is an acute viral disease that is accompanied by severe symptoms, blisters and ulcerative lesions of the mucous membranes and skin. The virus is also infectious to humans. There is no human-to-human infection. The main route of human infection is through raw milk from infected animals and its products, less through meat [see comment].

[2] Control measures in the affected village, regional vaccination

A cattle farm in the Vyshmanovo village was affected by foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) and can face complete elimination, according to vice-governor of the Vladimir region, Roman Rusanov. He also admitted that cattle have not been vaccinated since 2013.

According to the vice-governor Rusanov, the virus was detected at a very early stage of the outbreak and is localized in one sector of the village, called Sobinsky area that is now under quarantine.

The total number of cattle in the farm is 797 heads, of which nearly 400 are [milking] cows. All livestock has been vaccinated immediately after the outbreak and will be monitored for 14 days. Those cows that have been confirmed with FMD will go for slaughter. By 24 Oct 2016, 100 of them have been slaughtered.

The cows are being killed by a bloodless method, via lethal injection. Their carcasses are transported to the burial site, burned, and the ashes are treated with bleach.

Despite the fact that not all animals may get sick, according to Roman Rusanov the final decision may eventually be to eliminate all of them. "There are different opinions, but most likely we will eliminate the farm in order to prevent the spread to other farms of the entire province. It should not hurt economy of the province too much."

Samples of biomaterial showed that the animals "picked up" FMD virus type Asia 1, which is common in Asian countries. How the exotic strain could end up in the province of Vladimir region is not clear.

"The virus is widespread in Turkey and registered there on a daily basis. Together with experts from Rosselkhoznadzor veterinary and law enforcement agencies, we are trying to identify a source and the route of transmission of the virus to our region. When we will learn, we will share it with a public. For now, we need to concentrate on localizing the outbreak and preventing the spread via vaccination," said Roman Rusanov.

The vice-governor could not recall when Vladimir had the latest outbreak of FMD. In the spring of 2016 the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) has recognized Russia free from FMD [without vaccination]. The last mandatory vaccination against FMD in the Vladimir region was conducted in 2013. After that, the Russian Ministry of Agriculture has delegated the authority to make a decision about vaccination to the provinces.

"It was a decision of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rosselkhoznadzor that FMD is not a mandatory vaccination. Now the governor decided that we will vaccinate 100 percent of the cattle in our province to prevent such outbreaks. We will take it very seriously from now on," said Rusanov.

Mass vaccination of cows is expected to end on 25 Oct 2016. Of the 131 000 heads of cattle in the herds of the Vladimir region, more than 104 000 have already been vaccinated. All cows (100 percent) of the cows on public [commercial] farms are vaccinated, but it is harder to ensure the same coverage rate on private farms where, so far, about 75 percent of the cattle have been vaccinated so far.

The vice-governor Rusanov called upon all private owners of cattle to be proactive and directly reach out to veterinarians for vaccination, which should be free. According to him, the region has enough vaccines.

During the quarantine period in the village Vyshmanovo, selling raw unpasteurized milk is prohibited throughout the entire Vladimir region. In addition, as a temporary measure, cattle will not be allowed to exit the village.

[3] Kazakhstan bans imports from Russia
Date: Tue 25 Oct 2016

Due to the outbreak of FMD in Vladimir oblast, Kazakhstan has imposed restrictions on imports of Russian agricultural products of animal origin, as of 25 Oct 2016, according to the National Chamber of Entrepreneurs.

The Chamber informs that on 20 Oct 2016, the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) informed about the reported FMD outbreak in the territory of the village Vyshmanovo, Vladimir region, Russia.

In such situations, the sequence of actions is regulated at the international level, says the Chamber.

"In accordance with Article 8.8.2 of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code, one of the requirements for an FMD-free zone is that FMD vaccination has not been carried out there and that FMD has been absent for the last 12 months on the territory of the zone. Vladimir region is part of Russia's FMD-free zone without vaccination, officially assigned by the OIE in 2016," says the Chamber [see http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_fmd.htm].

According to the organization, on 24 Oct 2016, the Ministry of Agriculture of Kazakhstan informed the Rosselkhoznadzor in writing that, subject to the epizootic situation, it was decided to introduce since 25 Oct 2016 restrictions on the import from the Russian republic of agricultural products of the following categories: FMD susceptible animals; beef; pork; lamb; milk and dairy products; finished products which have not undergone successful heat-treatment in accordance with the recommendations of the OIE Code; non-food raw materials and products derived from the slaughter of FMD susceptible animals; used equipment for their maintenance, slaughter and processing, feed and feed additives for animals; feed and feed additives for animal and plant origin animal.

The Chamber provides a list of the [52] provinces of the Russian Federation, included in the above area: Bashkortostan, Karelia, Komi, Mari El Republic, Mordovia, Sakha (Yakutia), North Ossetia - Alania, Tatarstan, Udmurtia, Khakassia Republic, Chuvashia Republic, Autonomous Republic of Crimea, Kamchatka Territory, Krasnoyarsk, Perm, Arkhangelsk region, Belgorod oblast, Bryansk region, the Vladimir region, the Vologda region, the Voronezh region, the Ivanovo region, the Irkutsk region, the Kaliningrad region, the Kaluga region, the Kemerovo region, Kirov region, Kostroma region, Kursk region, Leningrad region, the Lipetsk region, the Magadan region, the Moscow region, the Murmansk region, Nizhny Novgorod region, Novgorod region, Orel region, the Penza region, Pskov region, Ryazan region, Sakhalin region, Sverdlovsk region, Smolensk region, Tambov region, Tver region, Tomsk region , Tula region, Ulyanovsk region, Yaroslavl region, Nenets, Khanty-Mansi Autonomous District, Yamalo-Nenets Chukotka Autonomous District.

"The Committee of veterinary control and supervision of the Ministry of Agriculture has notified in writing the territorial division of the limitations and the need for strict observance of regulations," added in the House.

Recall that in August 2016, due to the outbreak of nodular dermatitis [lumpy skin disease] in Atyrau oblast, Kazakhstan, Russia imposed a temporary ban on the import from Kazakhstan of cattle, meat and skins.

[Restrictions on imports of FMD-related products from Russia have been reported from other countries as well. The Russian authorities have undertaken severe measures to speed up the eradication of this enigmatic outbreak, which reportedly was detected at an early stage of its unfolding. Publication of the genotyping results of the FMDV strain involved are anticipated the earliest; the virus, reportedly confirmed in the laboratory on 19 Oct 2016 (RT-PCR, ELISA, CFT), is expected to be genotyped by the All-Russian FMD laboratory, recognised by the OIE as an FMD reference laboratory. ProMED awaits these results once available.

The withdrawal of pasteurised dairy products from the distribution channels, explained as related to public-health considerations, deserves to be explained. FMD is generally not regarded to be of significant risk to public health; on the contrary, most references (and the personal experience of several of ProMED-mail's moderators) indicate that human infections by FMD virus are, on top of their mildness, extremely rare (see also commentary in the 2 postings 20010504.0859, 20010429.0831).

The following citation [from the FMD chapter, http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/foot_and_mouth_disease.pdf (revised March 2015)] addresses the issue adequately:

"Public Health: Foot-and-mouth disease is not considered to be a public health problem, as infections seem to be very rare and their consequences mild. In the past, many people who worked with FMDV in vaccine laboratories or other locations developed antibodies to this virus, but there were few clinical cases. One laboratory reported only 2 cases in more than 50 years, and a large FMD vaccine manufacturer documented 3 cases among its workers. It may be that exposure to extremely large amounts of virus or a predisposing condition is necessary for infection. Between 1921 and 1969, reports of more than 40 laboratory-confirmed cases of FMD in humans were published. The symptoms included vesicular lesions and influenza-like symptoms, and the disease was generally mild, short-lived and self-limiting. Broken skin was a recognized route of entry for some human cases, with the initial lesions developing at the inoculation site. There is also a report that 3 veterinarians deliberately infected themselves in 1934, by drinking virus-contaminated, unpasteurized milk for 3 days. Person-to-person transmission has never been reported; however, vesicles from affected people do contain virus." [Note: Foot-and-mouth disease is not related to hand, foot and mouth disease, a condition seen only in humans.] - Mods.AS/CRD
