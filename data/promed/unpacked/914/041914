We have been informed by Dr Kande-Bure O`Bai Kamara, Outbreak Verification
Team, EMC/ESR, WHO HQ, Geneva that they were informed by their Nairobi
office on 23 July that as a result of a field investigation of the reported
outbreaks of "Rift Valley Fever" in the Tana River and Garrissa Districts
that it was severe malaria, not RVF. They noted a good response to
antimalarials. Some 500 people were affected with diarrhea, vomiting,
fever, and jaundice in a few cases; there were 7 deaths, not 15 as reported
in the newspapers. According to the Kenyan Ministry of Health, the
situation is now under control.
The original ProMED-mail postings were based on 3 separate reports: Pan
African News 6 July, The Nation (Nairobi) 8 July, and The Telegraph
(London) 9 July. In two of these Dr. David Muthama (Tana River Medical
Officer) was quoted as having announced at a news conference that the cases
either "were" or "resembled" RVF. In one report, Dr. Basil Criticos
(Assistant Health Minister) was quoted as announcing the cases were RVF.
Subsequently, we found another very similar report in the Weekly Mail &
Guardian (Nairobi) for 6 July.
We appreciate Dr Kande-Bure sharing this most recent information with us.
