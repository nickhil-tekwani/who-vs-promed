The discovery of equine herpesvirus EHV-1 at Laurel Park has forced travel restrictions on horses at Pimlico Race Course and Laurel Park.

"Effective immediately: No horses are allowed to ship out of Laurel or Pimlico, with the exception of Pimlico horses entered to run at Laurel," the Maryland Jockey Club tweeted Tuesday [9 Mar 2021] afternoon.

The Maryland Thoroughbred Horsemen's Association hosted a Zoom Q&A session Tuesday [9 Mar 2021] to discuss the situation with Maryland Department of Agriculture State Veterinarian Dr. Michael Odian.

"Equine herpesvirus 1 is a contagious virus which can cause neurological disease, respiratory disease, newborn death and abortion in horses," according to the University of Minnesota Extension.

An unnamed trainer at Laurel Park told Horse Racing Nation he had been told one horse had been diagnosed with EHV-1.

Cecil County, Maryland: A horse stabled at a private barn in Cecil County began displaying clinical signs of neurologic equine herpesvirus on Friday [5 Mar 2021]. The horse did not respond to treatment and was euthanized on Saturday [6 Mar 2021]. [This is not the same horse or the same county as the previous story of a horse at Pimlico, Laurel Park, Maryland. - Mod.TG]

Samples from the deceased horse were confirmed positive for neurologic equine herpesvirus on Monday [8 Mar 2021]. The barn has been placed on a hold order, with veterinary professionals monitoring all horses for clinical signs. The hold order will remain in place until all exposed horses have been cleared for release.

On 3 Mar 2021, an attending veterinarian in Pennsylvania reported a Chester County horse presenting with neurologic signs was suspected with equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1). Subsequently, the University of Pennsylvania's large animal hospital, New Bolton Center, in Kennett Square, diagnosed the horse as positive for equine herpesvirus [myeloencephalopathy] (EHM). The horse was euthanized.

An unspecified number of potentially exposed horses have been identified, and New Bolton Center and Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture (PDA) officials are contacting their owners. At this time, this case is unrelated to international travel, transport, or exhibition. New Bolton Center will provide updates as available, in conjunction with PDA.

The New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets, Division of Animal Industry, has confirmed 2 horses with EHV-1 and 2 horses with EHM, the neurologic form of the disease. All 4 horses are currently quarantined at a stable in Brewster. Their home facility has implemented strict biosecurity measures and temperature monitoring in cooperation with the state. The disease's origin is unknown and under investigation, according to the state.

One of the 4 positive horses (an EHM case) competed at Old Salem Farm in North Salem, New York. This horse arrived on the evening of Thursday [4 Mar 2021], competed in equitation on 5 Mar 2021, and returned home the same day. The horse started to exhibit signs on Sunday [7 Mar 2021].

The other EHM case exhibited signs on Monday [8 Mar 2021]. Veterinarians sampled the 2 additional EHV-1 cases due to their proximity to the index case.

Old Salem Farm currently has no known EHV-1 or EHM cases. Show management is cleaning and disinfecting the facility and following appropriate EHV-1 biosecurity protocols, according to the state's report.

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and equine herpesvirus myeloencephalitis (EHM, the neurologic form).

In many horses, the 1st or only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected. In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with EHM usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

Herpesvirus is easily spread by nose-to-nose or close contact with an infectious horse; sharing contaminated equipment including bits, buckets, and towels; or clothing, hands, or equipment of people who have recently had contact with an infectious horse. Routine biosecurity measures, including hygiene and basic cleaning and disinfection practices, should be in place at all times to help prevent disease spread.

Current EHV-1 vaccines might reduce viral shedding but are not protective against the neurologic form of the disease. Implementing routine biosecurity practices is the best way to minimize viral spread, and the best method of disease control is disease prevention.

The Tennessee State Veterinarian confirmed positive cases of respiratory equine herpesvirus in Knox and Shelby counties, with additional suspect and exposed horses.

In Knox County, a 14-day quarantine has been placed at the University of Tennessee Veterinary Teaching Hospital for the main equine barn facility and for horses in the isolation unit due to a confirmed case of respiratory equine herpesvirus. Two horses are also suspected of having the virus and 9 others are exposed.

The confirmed horse is alive and affected.

The Tennessee State Veterinarian also confirmed a positive respiratory equine herpesvirus case at a boarding facility in Shelby County. Another horse is suspected as having the virus and 100 other horses were exposed.

The confirmed horse was vaccinated and is affected with a fever and alive.

The diagnosis was confirmed as EHV-4 and currently, the horse is normal. A 2nd horse on the premises also was determined to have a fever and is also vaccinated. The facility veterinarian is managing the situation at the facility.

The Utah State Veterinarian has confirmed a case of neurologic equine herpesvirus in Davis County. Two other horses are suspected of having the virus, and 100 other horses have been exposed. The confirmed positive horse was euthanized after it became recumbent.

The horse confirmed with neurologic equine herpesvirus (also known as equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy, or EHM) was at Weber County Complex 8 days prior to becoming sick. Events at the Weber County Complex have been cancelled for the next 2 weeks.

Two horses previously at the Weber County Complex have fevers and are being tested for EHV-1. The 2 suspect cases are quarantined at separate facilities.

The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) confirmed that a private facility in San Bernardino County had 2 horses exhibit neurologic signs and test positive for equine herpesvirus.

A 10-year-old Arabian gelding displaying neurologic signs was confirmed positive for EHV-1 (non-neuropathogenic strain). At the time of this report, the gelding was alive and under veterinary care.

A 2nd horse on the property was exhibiting neurologic signs and tested positive for EHV-1. That horse was euthanized due to the severity of clinical signs.

Following an assessment of the home premises in San Bernardino County by CDFA personnel, 22 potentially exposed equids have been quarantined with enhanced biosecurity measures and twice daily temperature monitoring.

This premises is a private facility with no recent movement on or off the property, and these cases have no known links to any other EHV-1 cases.

CDFA will continue to actively monitor exposed equids.

[This appears to be a very busy season for EHV/EHM. Europe is having an issue with EHM, which may or not be a different strain than the Americas have. Nevertheless, EHM especially deserves the attention of the researchers, as this neurological disease has no vaccine, few effective treatments, and yet continues to cause havoc in the equine community/industry.

The following is from the Merck Veterinary Manual (https://www.merckvetmanual.com/respiratory-system/respiratory-diseases-of-horses/equine-herpesvirus-infection):

"Equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) and equine herpesvirus 4 (EHV-4) comprise 2 antigenically distinct groups of viruses previously referred to as subtypes 1 and 2 of EHV-1. Both viruses are ubiquitous in horse populations worldwide and produce an acute febrile respiratory disease upon primary infection, characterized by rhinopharyngitis and tracheobronchitis. Outbreaks of respiratory disease occur annually among foals in areas with concentrated horse populations. Most of these outbreaks in weanlings are caused by strains of EHV-4. The age, seasonal, and geographic distributions vary and are determined by immune status and horse population. In individual horses, the outcome of exposure is determined by viral strain, immune status, pregnancy status, and possibly age. Infection of pregnant mares with EHV-4 rarely results in abortion.

"Mares may abort several weeks to months after clinical or subclinical infection with EHV-1. The neurologic form of EHV-1 has demonstrated increasing morbidity and mortality in the documented outbreaks since 2000 and appears to be evolving in virulence and behavior. Therefore, the USDA has designated neuropathic EHV-1 as a potentially emerging disease. The natural reservoir of both EHV-1 and EHV-4 is the horse. Latent infections and carrier states are seen with both virus types. Transmission occurs by direct or indirect contact with infectious nasal secretions, aborted fetuses, placentas, or placental fluids.

"The incubation period of EHV is 2-10 days. Susceptible horses develop fever of 102-107 deg F (38.9-41.7 deg C), neutropenia and lymphopenia, serous nasal discharge, malaise, pharyngitis, cough, inappetence, and/or submandibular or retropharyngeal lymphadenopathy. Horses infected with EHV-1 strains often develop a biphasic fever, with cell-associated viremia coinciding with the 2nd temperature peak. Secondary bacterial infections are common and manifest with mucopurulent nasal exudate and pulmonary disease. The infection is mild or inapparent in horses immunologically sensitized to the virus.

"Mares that abort after EHV-1 infection seldom display premonitory signs. Abortions occur 2-12 wk after infection, usually between months 7 and 11 of gestation. Aborted fetuses are fresh or minimally autolyzed, and the placenta is expelled shortly after abortion. There is no evidence of damage to the mare's reproductive tract, and subsequent conception is unimpaired. Mares exposed late in gestation may not abort but give birth to live foals with fulminating viral pneumonitis. Such foals are susceptible to secondary bacterial infections and usually die within hours or days.

"Lesions: The pathogenetic mechanisms of EHV-1 and EHV-4 differ significantly. EHV-4 infection is restricted to respiratory tract epithelium and associated lymph nodes; EHV-1 strains develop cell-associated viremia and have a predilection for vascular endothelium, especially the nasal mucosa, lungs, placenta, adrenal, thyroid, and CNS. The neuropathic strain of EHV-1 produces a viremic load 10- to 100-fold higher than that of non-neuropathic strains.

"Gross lesions of viral rhinopneumonitis are hyperemia and ulceration of the respiratory epithelium, and multiple, tiny, plum-colored foci in the lungs. Histologically, there is evidence of inflammation, necrosis, and intranuclear inclusions in the respiratory epithelium and germinal centers of the associated lymph nodes. Lung lesions are characterized by neutrophilic infiltration of the terminal bronchioles, peribronchiolar and perivascular mononuclear cell infiltration, and serofibrinous exudate in the alveoli.

"Typical lesions in EHV-1 abortion include interlobular lung edema and pleural fluid; multifocal areas of hepatic necrosis; petechiation of the myocardium, adrenal gland, and spleen; and thymic necrosis. Intranuclear inclusions are found in lung, liver, adrenal, and lymphoreticular tissues.

"Diagnosis: Equine viral rhinopneumonitis is difficult to clinically differentiate from equine influenza (see equine influenza, https://www.merckvetmanual.com/respiratory-system/respiratory-diseases-of-horses/equine-influenza), equine viral arteritis (see equine viral arteritis, https://www.merckvetmanual.com/generalized-conditions/equine-viral-arteritis/overview-of-equine-viral-arteritis), or other equine respiratory infections solely on the basis of clinical signs. Definitive diagnosis is determined by PCR or virus isolation from samples obtained via nasopharyngeal swab and citrated blood sample (buffy coat) early in the course of the infection.

"In cases of suspected EHV-1 abortion, definitive diagnosis is based on PCR, virus isolation, and characteristic gross and microscopic lesions in the aborted fetus. Lung, liver, adrenal, and lymphoreticular tissues are productive sources of virus. Serologic testing of mares after abortion has little diagnostic value. Diagnosis of neuropathic EHV-1 is determined by real-time PCR on samples obtained from nasal secretions, CSF, or neural tissue to detect the neuropathic strain of EHV-1. A presumptive diagnosis can be based on clinical signs and CSF analysis (xanthochromia, albuminocytologic dissociation). Necropsy reveals characteristic perivascular cuffing and hemorrhage in the CNS.

"Treatment: There is no specific treatment for EHV infection. Rest and nursing care are indicated to minimize secondary bacterial complications. Antipyretics are recommended for horses with a fever greater than 104 deg F (40 deg C). Antibiotic therapy is instituted upon suspicion of secondary bacterial infection evidenced by purulent nasal discharge or pulmonary disease. Most foals infected prenatally with EHV-1 die shortly after birth despite intensive nursing and antimicrobial medication. If horses with neuropathic EHV-1 remain ambulatory or are recumbent for only 2-3 days, the prognosis is usually favorable. Valacyclovir (30 mg/kg, PO, bid) has shown promise in the treatment of affected horses and in prophylaxis during EHV-1 outbreaks. Intensive nursing care is necessary to avoid pulmonary congestion, pneumonia, ruptured bladder, or bowel atony. Recovery may be complete, but a small percentage of cases have neurologic sequelae.

"Control: Immunity after natural infection with either EHV-1 or EHV-4 involves a combination of humoral and cellular immunity. Whereas little cross-protection occurs between virus types after primary infection of immunologically naive foals, significant cross-protection develops in horses after repeated infections with a particular virus type. Most adult horses are latently infected with EHV-1 and EHV-4. The infection remains dormant for most of the horse's life, although stress or immunosuppression may result in recrudescence of disease and shedding of infectious virus. Immunity to reinfection of the respiratory tract may persist for as long as 3 mo, but multiple infections result in a level of immunity that prevents clinical signs of respiratory disease. Diminished resistance in pregnant mares allows cell-associated viremia, which may result in transplacental infection of the fetus.

"For prevention and control of EHV-4- and EHV-1-related diseases, management practices that reduce viral spread are recommended. New horses (or those returning from other premises) should be isolated for 21 days before commingling with resident horses, especially pregnant mares. Management-related, stress-inducing circumstances should be avoided to prevent recrudescence of latent virus. Pregnant mares should be maintained in a group away from the weanlings, yearlings, and horses out of training. In an outbreak of respiratory disease or abortion, affected horses should be isolated and appropriate measures taken for disinfection of contaminated premises. No horse should leave the premises for 3 wk after recovery of the last clinical case.

"Vaccination (EHV-4 and EHV-1) should begin when foals are 4-6 mo old. A 2nd dose is given 4-6 wk later, and a 3rd dose at 10-12 mo of age. Booster vaccinations may be indicated as often as every 6 mo through maturity (5 yr of age). Vaccination programs against herpesviruses should include all horses that travel to high-risk destinations (racetrack, show grounds) and all other horses on the premises. A high-antigen load, inactivated EHV-1 vaccine is recommended to prevent EHV-1 abortion. Vaccine should be administered during months 3, 5, 7, and 9 of pregnancy. Mares are often vaccinated with inactivated EHV-1/EHV-4 at an interval 4-6 wk before foaling. A modified-live EHV-1 vaccine is available to help prevent respiratory disease caused by EHV-1."
