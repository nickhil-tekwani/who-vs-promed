Africa's 1st outbreak of a deadly strain of bird flu has spread to at
least 4 farms, Nigerian officials said Thursday [9 Feb 2006], as the
continent braced itself for a possible epidemic.
Nigerian agriculture ministry spokesman Tope Ajakaiye said tests on
chicken carcasses had identified the H5N1 type of avian influenza,
which can kill humans, in northern Nigerian sites more than 200 km
(125 miles) apart.
"4 farms have been cordoned off and quarantined; one in Kaduna, 2
near Kano and one in Plateau State," he told AFP.
Previously, officials had said that the disease had only been
identified at Sambawa Farm near Kaduna, and Thursday's announcement
will increase fears that bird flu may be poised to spread rapidly
around the country.
At Sambawa farm itself, 300 km (185 miles) north of Abuja, 20 police
officers were deployed to block access to a site where 45 000
chickens are now known to have died from the highly infectious virus.
Kaduna State agriculture commissioner Lawal Yakawada told AFP that a
team from Nigeria's National Veterinary Research Institute would
arrive later in the day "to ensure that all the other chickens are
killed, burned and buried".
Agriculture ministry officials in the capital Abuja said experts from
the Food and Agriculture Organisation [FAO], World Health
Organisation [WHO] and the World Organisation for Animal Health [OIE]
were expected in Nigeria within 48 hours.
Ajaikaye also said that the United States had pledged 20 million
dollars (16.7 million euros) to help Nigeria fight the outbreak.
Experts from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would
come from their Kenya base and set up a laboratory in Nigeria, he
said. They are to bring 2000 protective suits for health and
veterinary workers, he added.
Kaduna State and neighbouring Kano State have broadcast radio spots
and sent education teams to farming areas to warn of the danger of
bird flu.
Experts fear Africa, with its underfunded health services and
populations weakened by AIDS and malnutrition, could now be facing a
new epidemic, which would devastate poultry farming and encourage the
virus to develop.
A South African veterinary institute said Thursday it is to conduct
tests on bird samples from Kenya, Malawi and Sudan to help track the
possible spread of bird flu.
"We have been asked by the FAO and the African Union to be a support
laboratory for the African continent," said Celia Abolnik, senior
researcher at Pretoria's Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute.
"We will be testing samples collected for surveillance on the African
continent," she told AFP, adding that the samples should arrive in
South Africa for testing in the next 2 weeks.
Experts have advised Nigeria and any country which subsequently
identifies a bird flu outbreak to limit the movement of poultry,
quarantine infected farms and destroy sick birds.
Nigeria has promised 2 billion naira
(15-million-dollar/13-million-euro) to do just that and to compensate
farmers for culled livestock, but health teams appeared to be slow to
be getting into place Thursday.
Auwalu Haruna, secretary of the Kano State poultry farmers'
association warned that farmers and traders were slaughtering sick
birds and rushing them to market for cheap sale "in a frantic effort
to minimise losses."
Meanwhile Kenya joined South Africa, Benin and Mauritania in banning
all poultry imports from Nigeria and ordered stepped up surveillance
measures aimed at preventing the spread of bird flu.

World veterinary experts yesterday raced to help Nigeria attempt to
contain a bird flu outbreak in the north of the country, as the
arrival of the deadly H5N1 virus in Africa was confirmed.
Its appearance on the world's poorest continent, where veterinary
controls are often weak and health systems are stretched by lack of
funds and epidemics such as HIV/AIDS, has long been feared, given the
potential for the disease to spread from infected birds to humans.
Many people live in close proximity to poultry, just as in south-east
Asia where H5N1 has cut a swath through domesticated flocks and
caused scores of deaths since it emerged late in 2003. Chicken is the
main, and often only, source of protein and there are fears that
owners might be reluctant to report disease.
European authorities are already assessing the risk from migratory
birds making the journey north from West Africa this spring, although
how big a factor migration is in spreading the disease is disputed.
Movements of poultry, traded exotic and other birds and of people are
all possible factors.
The highly pathogenic virus strain found in Nigeria -- which was
confirmed by tests in Padua, Italy -- is said to be similar to those
that have been found in birds in Siberia and Mongolia, and further
tests are under way to determine how close the Nigerian samples are
to the H5N1 detected in other parts of the world.
In London, the Department for Environment (Defra) claimed that while
the risk of a further global spread of avian flu was high, the
chances of it arriving in Britain remained low, although assessments
were being reviewed.
The news of the Nigerian outbreak, at a large farm in Jaji, in the
state of Kaduna, coincided with fears that bird flu is now spreading
through Iraq. The avian virus, which has already claimed the life of
a teenager in the largely autonomous region of Kurdistan, is now
being investigated as the possible cause of death of a pigeon-seller
in the southern city of Amara [see a separate posting re Iraqi
situation]. Worldwide, 88 of the 165 people confirmed as being
infected with the avian virus have died.
The threat remains that the virus will mutate further into something
that can spread easily between people and kill millions.
Samples were taken from the Nigerian farm, which is home to chicken,
geese and ostriches, on 16 Jan 2006. The owner had treated birds with
antibiotics before the flu was confirmed. Of 46 000 birds on the
farm, 40 000 had died.
The World Organisation for Animal Health, known as OIE, said it would
take immediate action and a team of experts was being sent to the
affected area to help the national authorities.
Alex Thiermann, one of the experts, said: "The significance is that
it's a completely new continent we are looking at." He commended the
quick response of the Nigerian authorities, including culling,
quarantine, controls on animal movement and disinfection, but noted
that the country was on a major migration flyway.
In Ghana, separated from Nigeria by Togo and Benin, authorities said
they were on full alert, doing random surveys and keeping an eye on
wild wetland birds. Samples from wild waterfowl in Malawi, Sudan and
Kenya will soon be tested at the Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute
in South Africa, the main testing site for avian flu in Africa.
Wild birds do carry avian flu, of which there are 144 types, but a
spokesman for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds warned
against jumping to conclusions. If the strain was carried by birds
migrating from parts of Europe already hit by the disease, the
outbreak would more likely have taken place in the east of the
continent. Andre Farrar said: "Teasing out what is underlying the
movement of the virus is proving a challenge, but it is all too easy
a shorthand that migrating birds spread it around. The concern is
about ducks, geese and swans, which don't go from the UK to Africa
and back again. Waterfowl wintering in Britain clear off in
March/April and are replaced by summer migrants, swallows and little
things that are not going to be a primary concern to moving H5N1.
They are more or less irrelevant in terms of risk to humans and
poultry."
Checks on more than 3000 wild birds in Britain during the autumn have
revealed 3 cases of low pathogenic avian flu, not of the H5N1 variety.
An assessment by Defra experts 3 weeks ago concluded: "Preliminary
discussions indicate that there is not much reliable information on
bird migration or mixing within Africa. It is however reasonable to
expect that birds will follow established routes: that is, birds that
have migrated to east Africa will return over eastern Europe to their
breeding grounds in southern Siberia, while the birds from west
Africa will return over the Mediteranean basin to their breeding
grounds in north Russia.
"It is, however, unlikely that a substantial number of migratory
birds would come directly from West Africa to the UK." [See further

Re: Avian influenza - worldwide (03): Nigeria, flyways
----------------------------------------
The introduction of HPAI H5N1 to northern Nigeria could have occurred
via a number of routes, including both traditional Sahelian trade
routes, newer commercial trade routes, and wild bird migrations last
fall. Without good epidemiologic investigation in addition to
genetic analyses, any conclusion is just speculation.
The outbreak area is not closely associated with the Niger Delta area
where higher numbers of migratory waterfowl would be expected, but is
somewhat closer to smaller river delta complexes. Since the outbreak
has been underway for some time, it is possible that infected poultry
has now been unknowingly moved around the country or to neighboring
countries, thus providing an opportunity to spread the infection to
other domestic poultry and also contaminate areas where wild birds
may become infected prior to northward spring migration. Once again,
controlling outbreaks in domestic poultry is the most scientifically
sound and immediate solution to limiting the persistence of this
disease and detailed wild bird censuses and disease surveillance
could help determine additional routes of potential spread and areas
at future risk.
As Deborah MacKenzie noted from the New Scientist article, northern
pintails (_Anas acuta_) and garganey ducks (_Anas querquedula_)
breeding in Siberia last summer migrate to winter in this region of
West Africa. Both species also winter in large numbers in East
Africa where no HPAI has been found this winter. Northern pintails
from the same summer breeding grounds in Siberia also winter in the
Black Sea, Mediterranean, North Sea of Europe and Britain, the latter
2 areas not showing any evidence of HPAI H5N1 to date. This could
suggest that summer breeding grounds were not the source of HPAI
infection in wild birds but rather they became infected by domestic
poultry at other points along their diverse fall migration routes (an
HIV-contaminated needle model), or that nest site fidelity as seen in
other colonial waterfowl and possibly feeding site fidelity at summer
breeding grounds provides some mechanism to reduce infection between
groups of con-specifics and/or species. The latter could also
partially explain the rarity of shared avian influenza strains
between the old world and the new world. In any case, the simple
presence of the same species of wild bird in 2 geographic areas does
not indicate a transmission route.

[We thank Dr. Karesh for his thoughtful comments adding insight into
the possible ways Avian Influenza could have entered Nigeria. We
really do need to mount a full blown outbreak investigation to
determine the source of the virus using classic outbreak
investigation tools, molecular epidemiology and the best techniques
in wildlife health to unravel this particular incursion of the virus
into a yet another new geographic area. There are many questions to
be asked. For example, this is classically harmattan season in
Nigeria, a time of relative cool in the North characterized by
seasonal wind currents that pick up sand and dust from the Sahara and
deposit it long distances away into Northern Nigeria and even points
further south. How prominent is the harmattan this year and could it
have played a role?
A range of poultry production systems exist in Nigeria spanning
intensively managed types with excellent veterinary care to largely
neglected backyard flocks keep by single household. We should
remember that some estimates have Nigeria containing 20% of
sub-Saharan Africa's human population and so the need for human
surveillance is of the utmost urgency. It is possible that if the
outbreak is only in intensive farms all of us may dodge a bullet in
this case. While that is the hope but I suspect Mod AS is correct in
that too much time has passed between the clinical outbreak and
diagnosis -see Avian influenza - worldwide (03): Nigeria, flyways
20060209.0427. How many resources were mobilized, how quickly
disease control tactics were applied are the key. Knowing the mode of
introduction and means of spread are also critical to the success of
control efforts. We wish the Nigerian health control officials at
all levels the best of luck and swift progress. - Mod PC]

The deadly H5N1 bird flu virus was confirmed in 2 more Nigerian
states on Thu [9 Feb 2006] as authorities grappled to contain the
disease with quarantine orders and culling.
Nigeria reported Africa's 1st confirmed cases on Wed [8 Feb 2006] of
the highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza, which has forced the
slaughter of more than 100 million birds in Asia and jumped to humans
in Asia, Europe and the Middle East.
The bird flu outbreak was first reported at a poultry farm in
northern Kaduna State, affecting tens of thousands of birds, but by
Thursday authorities had reported new cases of fowls with H5N1 in
neighbouring Kano State and Plateau State.
"The federal government is doing everything to contain the disease
within the 3 centres that have been located," said a statement from
Agriculture Ministry spokesman Tope Ajakaiye. [This news item, at the
above URL, includes a map].
The United States has pledged US USD 25 million to help Africa's most
populous nation combat the disease, and is dispatching an expert team
expected in the next 4 days from the Centre for Disease Control in
Atlanta, Ajakaiye added.
"The team will come with 2000 protective suits that will be used in
the affected areas," he said.
Fowl have been dying in large numbers across northern Nigeria for the
past 4 weeks and surveillance teams have been sent to scour northern
Nigeria in search of suspect farms.
Once identified, farms are placed under quarantine and birds marked
for destruction if infected.
The BBC reported on Thursday that farmers in northern Nigeria are
rushing to sell dead chickens at cut-price rates before government
bans are put into place.
The "highly pathogenic H5N1" strain of the avian influenza virus was
confirmed by the Paris-based OIE at a battery farm in Jaji village,
Kaduna. All the 46 000 chickens, geese, and ostrich at the farm have
been destroyed, according to OIE.
OIE spokeswoman Maria Zampaglione told IRIN by phone on Thursday a
team of global experts on bird flu was being assembled to travel to
Nigeria but could not say when they would arrive.
"Some experts are still on assignment in Turkey, and in eastern
European countries," she said. "It's not easy, there are not that
many avian flu experts around."
Agriculture Minister Adamu Bello said samples were taken on 16 Jan
2006 from the farm in the town of Jaji, Kaduna. The avian viral
strain found, isolated by a reference laboratory in Padova, Italy
jointly run by the OIE and the FAO, is undergoing further
investigation to determine its relationship with other known strains
of the virus, the organisation said.

[It may be assumed that none of the 4 outbreaks -- the one in Kaduna
confirmed yesterday and the other 3, currently under investigation --
are primary outbreaks in Nigeria. Backyard poultry might have been
their source of infection. The crucial questions are how far and how
long has the virus been circulating in Nigeria. As remarked by Dr
Karesh, for whose observations we are grateful, there are at least 3
possible introduction routes; all may have taken place earlier this
year or even since fall 2005. In addition, as he rightly states,
without good epidemiologic investigation in addition to genetic
analyses, any conclusion is just speculation.
If widespread, surveillance and culling might not be feasible; mass
vaccination should be considered.
