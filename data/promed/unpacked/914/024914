NEW YORK: A team of scientists at the Pasteur Institute in Paris has
isolated a gene fragment from 3 new viruses in chimpanzees and an ape, that
appear to be closely related to Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus
(KSHV) of humans [now usually designated Human herpesvirus 8 or HHV-8
-Mod.CP. Karposi's sarcoma, a type of cancer that results in lesions
appearing as raised blotches on the skin [and mucous membranes, as well as
organs as noted below -DS, is associated with AIDS. In a new study, Dr.
Antoine Gessain and colleagues [have found KSHV-like viruses in 30
wild-born chimpanzees and 5 gorillas from central Africa. Signs of
KSHV-like viruses were found in 22 of the animals, and 2 novel KSHV-like
herpesviruses were detected in chimpanzees and another was found in a
gorilla. These findings suggest that great apes from central Africa could
serve as a reservoir of viruses that could spread to humans that come into
contact with the animals.
The authors note that: "The increased contact between great apes and humans
in central Africa generated by hunting and butchering for local meat and/or
'bushmeat' trade as well as by recent socioeconomic change such as intense
commercial logging, provides more opportunity for inter-species viral
transmission." Indeed, these newly discovered herpesviruses may already
exist in humans, and it is possible that they may not cause disease or
cannot be spread from person to person. The authors conclude that: "Our
discovery of these new KSHV-related sequences in chimpanzees and gorillas
will enable their likely human counterparts to be identified."

KHSV is classified in the genus _Rhadinovirus_, which is included in the
subfamily _Gammaherpesvirinae_. Several rhadinoviruses have been found in a
variety of mammalian hosts, including New and Old World monkeys, although
up until the present not in apes. The authors of the Nature paper now
describe detection and sequencing of a polymerase gene fragment from 3 new
rhadinoviruses discovered in chimpanzees and a gorilla, which are more
closely related to the human KSHV than to any other virus of this genus
described so far. They suggest from these observations that great apes from
central Africa could serve as a reservoir of viruses that could spread to
humans that come into contact with these animals. At present there is no
direct evidence to substantiate this extrapolation.
Kaposi's sarcoma, discovered in 1872 by Moritz Kaposi, presents as
cutaneous lesions predominantly on the extremities, but may involve other
organs in the more aggressive forms of the disease. Before the AIDS era,
classic Kaposi's sarcoma was observed in a benign form mainly in elderly
men of Mediterranean, Middle Eastern and Jewish descent. However, African
(or endemic) Kaposi's sarcoma was more prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa
usually affecting men, but also children of both sexes. The commonest form
of Kaposi's sarcoma now is AIDS-related, which is more a aggressive disease
in character. Many viruses, including HIV itself, were implicated as
causative agents. However, in 1994 a new human herpesvirus, (HHV-8), was
discovered which is almost invariably associated with Kaposi's sarcoma. It
is a close relative of the viruses that have been detected in apes by the
French group. Seroepidemiology and PCR-assays implicate HHV-8 as the cause
of Kaposi's sarcoma. However, HHV-8 has yet to be shown to be a
transforming virus in vitro. -Mod.CP
