Nearly 2 000 head of cattle, from different ranches around the Brazilian
town of Camapua, state of Mato Grosso do Sul, have been found dead, the
result of a strange illness, according to reports in the Brazilian press.
Experts from the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture, Department of
Agriculture and Livestock Inspection and Protection, who examined the dead
cattle, discarded the possibility that the animals were victims of
hoof-and-mouth disease.

More than 10 years ago I saw similar mass mortality in cattle in Mato
Grosso do Sul, I think it was in Aguas Claras, caused by lightning strikes
during a storm.

[From the little we know here, FMD is not likely the direct cause. While
morbidity with FMD can be very high, FMD generally causes significant
mortality only in young animals. Under some circumstances FMD exposed
animals will be slaughtered to stop the spread of the virus but there is no
evidence of this occurring in this report. Something must be going on
because 2000 cattle in a relatively small area is significant. Does anyone
have details? -Mod.PC]
