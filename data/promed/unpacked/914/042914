The wheat disease septoria blotch was discovered to be resistant to Group 11 fungicides (strobilurins) in southern South Australia. It was a chance discovery from a trial aimed at another pathogen. Thanks to this, the mutation was found before growers noticed fungicide failures in the paddock, which gives a time advantage to stay on top of it. When selection pressure is high, strobilurin resistance can spread very quickly.

Genetic tests have confirmed the presence of mutation G143A which is associated with resistance to all Group 11 fungicides. No other fungicide groups are affected by this mutation. The timeliness of the discovery has highlighted the importance of disease monitoring. Growers are advised to adopt resistance management that includes fungicides with different modes of action and avoids strobilurins, keeping in mind that not all demethylase inhibitor fungicides (DMI, Group 3) are completely effective anymore either.

[Septoria leaf blotch of cereals is caused by fungi in the septoria species complex, which includes _Zymoseptoria tritici_ (previously _Septoria tritici_), _Mycosphaerella graminicola_ and _Phaeosphaeria nodorum_ (previously _Stagonospora nodorum_). They affect mainly wheat, but also barley, oats, occasionally rye, as well as some grass species. Symptoms on wheat and barley are very similar, they may occur at any time during the growth cycle and on any portion of the plant. They include blotches on both leaves and glumes which reduce the photosynthetic ability of the host. Disease development is favoured by humid conditions. Up to 50 percent yield losses have been reported on susceptible varieties.

Spores can be spread by infected plant material, wind, water (rain splash), and mechanical means. The pathogens can overwinter on crop debris and on autumn sown crops or volunteers. Disease management includes fungicide treatments aimed at preventing the disease from becoming established on the upper 3 leaves of the crop canopy (where it would affect the ears most), removal of inoculum sources, and use of resistant varieties. After the cereal rusts, septoria is considered the most important challenge to plant breeders (see ProMED post 20120831.1274190) and a threat to food security worldwide.

Pathogen strains with high levels of resistance to many fungicides are emerging in different regions (e.g. ProMED posts 20160516.4225677 and 20161031.4598540). Furthermore, the number of fungicides available for septoria control has been decreasing due to withdrawal of products for environmental reasons (e.g. in Europe, ProMED post 20210223.8207530). In addition to fungicide resistant pathogen strains, host resistance breaking strains are being observed in recent years (e.g. ProMED posts 20210721.8533591 and 20190218.6322156).

In the region, strobilurin resistant septoria blotch has been reported previously in New Zealand (ProMED post 20140417.2410219). In Australia, DMI resistant septoria was reported as the 1st wheat pathogen developing fungicide resistance on that continent (ProMED post 20140313.2329774).

Strobilurins are strongly antifungal agents produced by fungi. Being derived from natural products, they are considered environmentally safe and are used against most major fungal crop diseases. Therefore, pathogen resistance is of major concern to many primary industries worldwide. Demethylase inhibitors (DMI; also called azole or sterol biosynthesis inhibiting fungicides) are the largest class of fungicides. They were introduced in the 1970s and new products continue to be developed. Rotating or mixing chemical classes of fungicides is used to extend the useful life of the compounds.
