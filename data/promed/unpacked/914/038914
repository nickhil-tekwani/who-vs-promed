[Excerpted & translated by Mod.JW

Yesterday, 25 Mar 1998, 21 new cases of dengue were registered, taking the
total so far for March to 244, and the total for 1998 to 455. [It is not
clear from the story whether this refers to the city of Rio only or to the
whole state, but the context is the city. Note that registered cases are
usually only a small fraction of actual cases - Mod.JW
The city stock of ULV (ultra low volume) insecticide [type not stated,
probably malathion for the spray trucks will run out this weekend. A new
supply from the Federal Government is expected next Monday. But Paulo
Celera, executive secretary of the Program to Eradicate Aedes aegypti of
the National Health Foundation, says that, while not minimizing the
importance of spraying, destroying mosquito breeding foci is much more
important, and this is the job of the state's 7,700 sanitary guards.
It is also reported that 8 of the 17 spray trucks in the state are reported
to be out of order, and only 240 of the 398 vehicles for transporting the
sanitary guards are in operating condition.

[Mr Celera is correct about the value of spraying versus destruction of
breeding foci; he might have added that the community could play a vital
part by cooperating in destroying breeding containers in their own houses
and backyards. Also, it would seem that fixing the vehicles for the guards
should be a higher priority than purchasing insecticide - Mod.JW
