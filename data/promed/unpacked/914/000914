Dr. Ian Hancock posted 2 questions about the aerial transmission
model [ref. (55) above.

We have the old English Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) gaussian
dispersion model in our institute, and I have checked the Fortran code
10 years ago when we bought the program. I cannot remember
[whether the model takes viral decay into account. The model only
calculates spread over 10 km distance with a normal wind speed of e.g.
3 Beaufort (= 4.5 m/s); it travels more than 16 km in one hour.

There have been publications on this issue:

1. Donaldson, AI 1976 "The survival of some air-borne animal viruses
in relation to relative humidity." Vet. Microbiol.1, 413-420,

2. Ferris NP 1975 "The survival of foot and mouth disease virus in
open air conditions." J Hyg Lond. Jun; 74(3): 409 16.

The information from these articles has been used in the model.
According to the last publication, virus inactivation due to open-air
factor was slight. Similarly, the effect of daylight on the survival
of virus was not marked. The model certainly takes relative humidity
into account, although very crudely: no survival at relative humidity
(RH) below 60 percent, complete survival at RH above 60 percent.

For the second question, I do not think the anxiety of the animals is
very important at the time of killing, but the anxiety of the people
killing them [is important. As a veterinarian I always learned that
we had to clean before we disinfect.

In such a case, we move the contaminated material somewhere and
make sure that the area we have to disinfect is clean and the disinfectant
works very well. When you are cleaning a slaughterhouse, that is not a
problem; just wash your contaminated material down the sewage,
aerosolize it and blow it away by the ventilator. But in case of an
outbreak of a notifiable disease this is completely wrong. High
pressure cleaners should be abandoned and cleaning should be done in
presence of the disinfectant, using brushes and hard labor.

The OIE in its animal health code states this very clearly (although I
never have understood why the outside of vehicles can be cleaned with
high pressure, but all other material should be cleaned by careful
brushing).

From Article 3.6.1.1. OIE Animal Health Code:

"e) no matter what substances are used, disinfection techniques should
comprise the following:

i) thorough soaking of bedding and litter as well as fecal matter with
the disinfectant;

ii) washing and cleaning by careful brushing and scrubbing of the
ground, floors and walls;

iii) then further washing with the disinfectant;

iv) washing and disinfecting the outside of vehicles; these procedures
will be carried out, if possible, with liquids applied under pressure
and the washing, disinfecting or destroying of articles used for tying
up the animals (ropes, reins, etc.) should not be omitted."

So if we are looking for differences between this epidemic and
previous ones, I think we especially have to look at the way the
epidemic is handled (e.g., high-pressure cleaning was not as common in
1967 as it is nowadays) and you do not have to look for differences in
the virus (although the absence of lamb mortality is somehow different
from what I have seen in textbooks).

In response to Ian Hancock's questions:

a) Direct sunlight killing of FMD virus is not directly taken into
account in the airborne spread models, however, there it is
indirectly.

1. Bright sunlight and cloud-free conditions cause unstable
atmospheric conditions due to thermals etc., hence plumes are
dispersed, causing reduced plume concentrations downwind.

2. Relative humidity below 60 percent, more likely in bright clear
conditions, is assumed to cause desiccation and death of virus.

b) Virus excretion estimation work has used experimental animals at
Pirbright (e.g., see Sellers and Parker, J. of Hygiene, Cambridge 67,
671-677, 1969) . I don't know whether these animals would be
considered "stressed." In the dispersion models, the total numbers of
animals likely to be excreting virus off the farm at the time is used.
Generally a point source representing where the animals are housed or
culled is used.

c) [In response to "To what extent are virus particles aerosolized
during disinfectant spraying, and how efficient is virus killing in
this state?, I don't know.

[The gaussian model Ian Hancock mentions is really very old now. It
is hard to guess which model exactly , but it may well be Gloster's
model of the late 1970s/1980, as he states it is in Fortran. Better models
use the movement of bodies of air, "puff" models; gaussian models are
useful but very out of date.

Stress in animals awaiting slaughter, especially given the confusion and
inefficiencies reported in the UK press and the potential impacts on
virus production, should not be ignored.

As to any possible aerosols produced during farm cleaning and
disinfection, this is not a matter for discussion and legal statements, but
measurement. Mod.MJH/TG/JW
