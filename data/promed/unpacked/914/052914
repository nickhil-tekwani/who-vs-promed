A suspected outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) has been
reported in the Habu Extension area near Nokaneng in Ngamiland
District (Zone 2). The director of Veterinary Services, Dr Musa
Fanikiso, said their suspicions are based on clinical signs and so
far involves cattle only.

Samples have been sent to the Botswana Vaccine Institute for testing.
In a press statement, Dr Fanikiso said due to the suspected outbreak,
some measures have been put in place with immediate effect. These
measures include the banning of movement of all cloven-hoofed
livestock (cattle, sheep, goats, pigs) and wildlife into, out of, or
within Zone 2 (Ngamiland district). Movement of fresh products from
cloven-hoofed animals (milk, meat, skins, and trophies) out of and
within Zone 2 is prohibited. [Movement of] processed products such as
UHT milk, canned meat, cheese, and yoghurt is allowed.

Dr Fanikiso said veterinary officers have started mounting
inspections and surveillance of animals within the affected area. He
said farmers are requested to cooperate with the teams by herding
their cattle and presenting them for inspection as and when required.

Other measures include roadblocks at all major gates out of Ngamiland
District and all exit routes out of Habu Extension Area. The
department appeals to the general public to cooperate with personnel
manning these road blocks and not to carry any of the banned items
and that the department will continue to monitor the situation and
will inform the public of any further developments.

The suspected outbreak will not interfere with slaughter at the 2
Botswana Meat Commission (BMC) abattoirs and the usual countrywide
livestock movements.

[Ngamiland is a region in NW Botswana, north of the Kalahari Desert.
It includes the Okavango marshes and Lake; see map at

Botswana is a beef exporting country, where specific arrangements are
applied to allow continuous exports from non-vaccinating regions.
During 2006, FMDV serotype SAT 2 was identified in zone 7 (Selibe
Phikwe), where 32 outbreaks were recorded in cattle; see OIE (World
Organization for Animal Health) reports and map at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=5143>.

Confirmation or otherwise, and -- in case confirmed -- details on the
FMDV serotype involved, and possible implications -- or their absence
-- upon exports, are anticipated. - Mod.AS]
