PULMONARY ATALECTASIS, ETIOLOGY: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
========================================================
Date: Thurs, 13 Mar 1997 15:10:00 MST
From: Steven S. Yoon <say7@CEHDEH1.EM.CDC.GOV>
We are investigating a pathologist's claim that _Clostridium perfringens_
type A toxin had caused massive pulmonary atelectasis which lead to death.
As far as I am aware, there has never been a documented case of this nature.
If any ProMED-mail readers have come across anything like this, I would
appreciate it if they would contact me.
