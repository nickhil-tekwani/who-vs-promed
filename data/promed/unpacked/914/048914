The Kano state government says the outbreak of cerebrospinal meningitis was responsible for the deaths of 8 persons in Dungurawa village of Dawakin Tofa Local Government Area of [Kano] state.

The state commissioner for health, Kabiru Getso, made the disclosure at a news conference in Kano on Wednesday [28 Mar 2018]. He said that the ministry received the information about the outbreak of a strange disease and dispatched its Rapid Response Team to the area. "The team reported that the 1st case was reported on 15 Mar [2018] in the area, and the victims died instantly before reaching a health facility," he said. He said some other cases were recorded in the area but were not reported early to the hospitals.

Mr Getso further revealed that the patients had a high fever and convulsions, as well as vomiting, and it was later confirmed to be cerebrospinal meningitis type A. The state, he said, had already strengthened surveillance to fish out unreported cases and had also set up a special team to deal with the people identified with the disease.

He said, in addition, that the ministry had also embarked on a massive mobilization on the disease because of its fast spreading and contagious nature.
