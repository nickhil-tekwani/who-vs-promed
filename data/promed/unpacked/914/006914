As the nation braces for a torrent of COVID-19 infections caused by the new omicron (B.1.1.529) variant, the White House today [17 Dec 2021] unveiled a new strategy to keep unvaccinated children in school rather than quarantining at home after a COVID-19 exposure. The Test to Stay strategy involves testing close contacts of a COVID-19 student at least twice during the week after the exposure. If the contact tests negative, he or she can remain in school instead of waiting out a 2-week quarantine at home.

At a White House press briefing today [17 Dec 2021], Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPH, outlined 2 CDC studies today in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report showing how Test to Stay benefitted K-12 schools in Lake County, Illinois, and Los Angeles County, California, this fall [2021].

In the Lake County study, secondary transmission among 90 schools using Test to Stay was 1.5%, preserving more than 8000 in-person learning days. While close contacts didn't spread the virus at school, some passed it to household contacts (http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm705152e2).

The Los Angeles County study showed that 1 in 5 public schools adopted the Test to Stay strategy, with a higher percentage of disadvantaged schools electing not to participate. In participating schools, student COVID-19 rates did not increase, and close contacts did not appear to spread the virus. Nonparticipating schools, on the other hand, lost about 92 000 learning days (http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm705152e1).

"CDC is updating our materials to help schools and parents know how to best implement this promising and now-proven practice, along with our multilayer prevention strategies that will help keep our children in the classroom safely," Walensky said, emphasizing that the strategy is not a substitute for vaccination of kids 5 and up and the wearing of face coverings in school.

At the briefing today [17 Dec 2021], Walensky also noted that the CDC is endorsing updated Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidance yesterday [16 Dec 2021] recommending that Americans receive an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine over Johnson & Johnson's shot. The recommendation was based on vaccine effectiveness and safety, as well as rare adverse events and the US vaccine supply. Countries such as Canada and the United Kingdom have made similar recommendations.

"Given the current state of the pandemic both here and around the world, the ACIP reaffirmed that receiving any vaccine is better than being unvaccinated," the CDC said in a statement yesterday [16 Dec 2021]. "Individuals who are unable or unwilling to receive an mRNA vaccine will continue to have access to Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine."

In a study finding that was certainly disappointing to many parents of children 2-5 years, a low dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine did not produce a potent immune response in that age-group, the companies said today [17 Dec 2021] in a statement.

As part of an ongoing clinical trial of the vaccine, the companies used a 3-microgram dose (one-tenth of the adult dose) in children 6 months to younger than 5 years. While 2 doses generated an immune response similar to that in people 16-25 years in those 6 months-2 years, it failed in 2-5-year-olds. Pfizer and BioNTech said that they plan to test a 3rd low dose in children 6 months-5 years but don't expect to test a higher dose in children 2-5 years.

In other Pfizer news yesterday [16 Dec 2021], the CDC said that it has received reports of 8 cases of mild myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) in children ages 5-11 who received the Pfizer vaccine, Reuters reports (https://www.reuters.com/world/us/eight-heart-inflammation-cases-seen-among-young-kids-who-got-covid-19-shot-us-2021-12-16/).

Also in anticipation of an onslaught of omicron cases within the next few weeks, US public health officials are stockpiling sotrovimab, the one monoclonal antibody that appears to retain efficacy against the variant, according to the Washington Post (https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/12/16/monoclonal-antibody-sotrovimab/).

The United States reported 138 885 new COVID-19 cases and 1142 deaths yesterday [16 Dec 2021], according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker. The Washington Post tracker shows that the 7-day average of new daily cases is 124 110, with 1275 daily deaths.

COVID-19 cases rose 10% week over week in 13 states, including Texas, Connecticut, and Hawaii, where they spiked over 50% from last week. New York made up 10% of new cases over the past week, CNN reports (https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/covid-omicron-variant-12-17-21-intl).

In New York, the state health department reported 18 276 new COVID-19 cases yesterday [16 Dec 2021], the highest number since January 2020, NBC News reports. Over the past week, test positivity in New York City doubled in just 3 days (https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/nyc-covid-surge-brings-rising-cases-testing-shortages-rcna9007).

Amid the city's rising infection rate, New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio announced a 6-step strategy to head off a winter surge of COVID-19 infections, the New York Times reports. The plan involves distributing a million free KN95 masks and 500 000 at-home tests, opening more testing sites, increasing enforcement of mask and vaccine mandates, and promoting booster shots (https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/16/nyregion/hochul-new-york-omicron-testing.html).

In Florida, the omicron variant now makes up nearly 100% of strains in wastewater samples, ABC News reports (https://abcnews.go.com/Health/live-updates/coronavirus/?id= 81717146#81802302).

Among all Americans, 61.2% are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 72.4% have received at least one dose of vaccine, and 28.1% of fully vaccinated Americans have received a booster, according to the CDC's COVID Data Tracker (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total).

And all US military branches have begun cracking down on troops who haven't been vaccinated against COVID-19, the Associated Press reports. Yesterday [16 Dec 2021], the Marine Corps said it has discharged 103 Marines, and the Army said it has reprimanded more than 2700 soldiers (https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-army-e4f9a23a953750b663bd7b0532ac4db7).

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/17/hundreds-off-work-ill-at-leading-london-hospital-as-omicron-cases-surge


Omicron is having a significant impact on staff at a large hospital trust with hundreds off work due to illness, leading to the cancellation of non-essential services to tackle a surge in admissions driven by the variant.

Guy's and St Thomas' trust (GSTT) in London is preparing to redeploy staff to work in its A&E and intensive care units to cover for the growing number of staff who are off work sick. It has seen the number of hospitalised patients with COVID it is treating jump by one-third over the last week and is bracing itself for worse to come in the days ahead.

Rising COVID cases have also left London fire and rescue services with "unprecedented" staff shortages, the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said, with almost one-third of London's fire engines out of action at points in the last week.

In a memo sent on Friday [17 Dec 2021] to staff in the emergency departments of the 2 hospitals it runs in south London, GSTT said: "Omicron is now having a significant impact on the work we are doing. This is being felt not only with the increase in patient attendances (COVID admissions have increased one-third over the last week) but also on staff sickness and subsequent absence from work. Omicron is now the dominant variant, with over 60% of positive cases locally being due to this new strain and with a doubling rate of 2 days in the local community. London is once again at the eye of this current storm," the memo said.

Hospital bosses across the NHS are finalising details of how they will deal with a potentially huge increase in the number of people which the new strain leaves seriously ill with COVID. Some doctors and scientists fear that the coming wave of hospitalisations could be even bigger than the peak of 39 000 cases seen UK-wide in January [2021].

The UK reported record COVID cases for a 3rd day in a row on Friday [17 Dec 2021], with 93 045 new cases, up 39% on the week. A further 900 people were hospitalised with the virus and 111 people died. The UK Health Security Agency confirmed another 3201 omicron cases, bringing the UK total to 14 909.

GSTT also told A&E staff that "as of yesterday [16 Dec 2021] there were more than 350 staff members off work and isolating across the organisations due to COVID -- a 25% increase on the previous day."

Amanda Pritchard, the chief executive of NHS England, ran GSTT until 2019. Boris Johnson said that staff in the intensive care unit at St Thomas's had saved his life when he was hospitalised there with COVID in April 2020, during the 1st lockdown.

Omicron is forcing the trust to take action in order "to reduce the risk to all services and continue to deliver essential care to our patients." As a result, "all non-essential services have been stood down or reduced" and "staff are being identified for redeployment to core services such as ours." The memo also said that GSTT was already seeing "significant shortages" and had asked for personnel to be redeployed there "to ensure safe staffing levels are maintained over coming weeks."

Chris Hopson, the chief executive of the hospitals group NHS Providers, said: "With over 93 000 new cases of COVID confirmed today [17 Dec 2021], trust leaders are understandably anxious about the weeks ahead as the omicron variant takes hold in the community and, inevitably, within the health and care workforce. We are already seeing NHS staff shortages in hotspots like London with worrying increases in the number of staff having to take time off work due to COVID-19 self-isolation or sickness. This is expected to rise in the weeks ahead. The knock-on effect on the workloads of remaining staff -- who are already working incredibly hard given the huge demands on the service -- is a major concern."

There were similar issues with the London fire brigade (LFB), with almost 10% of operational firefighters either having tested positive or self-isolating, according to LFB statistics for Thursday [16 Dec 2021]. The LFB said 141 firefighters had tested positive and 283 were self-isolating.

The FBU London regional secretary, Jon Lambe, said: "The new omicron variant is having a devastating impact on the London fire brigade." According to London fire brigade statistics, 40 fire engines were unavailable for the day and night shifts on Thursday [16 Dec 2021]. There are 142 fire engines in London.

Up to 130 000 NHS staff in England could be off sick with COVID by Christmas Day, unless ministers take new steps to tackle omicron's rapid spread, the British Medical Association is warning. A new analysis by the doctors' union found that on current trends anywhere from 32 000 medics, nurses and other personnel will be infected by 25 Dec 2021, and that "in the worst case scenario" more than 130 000 staff -- one in 10 of the total -- may be off sick.

[3] South Africa: infection rates soaring
Date: Fri 17 Dec 2021

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/12/17/south-africa-sees-fewer-hospitalisations-as-omicron-cases-soar


COVID-19 infection rates are soaring across South Africa as a result of the highly mutated omicron variant of the coronavirus, but fewer people have died or required hospital treatment compared with previous waves of the disease, according to health officials.

South Africa on Wednesday [15 Dec 2021] recorded its highest number of cases since the spread of the pandemic, driven by the rapid spread of omicron. However, Dr Michelle Groome, of the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), said on Friday [17 Dec 2021] that hospitalisations have not increased "at such a dramatic rate. We are starting to see some increases, but relatively small increases in deaths," she told a news conference.

Dr Wassila Jassat, also from the NICD, said the number of people requiring oxygen was "lower than what it was in comparison to any of the previous wave periods. Patients do seem to stay for a shorter duration," she said.

Health Minister Joe Phaahla said the data do not mean that omicron is less virulent, but rather that vaccines are preventing serious illness. "It's probably due to significant vaccine coverage," particularly among older people, he said.

About 31% of the population is fully vaccinated, but the number rises to 66% for people over the age of 60. Older people are most at risk of developing serious symptoms.

Scientists remain uncertain how dangerous omicron is, but early data suggest it can be more resistant to vaccines and is more transmissible than the delta variant.

In the United States, the world's hardest-hit country, the average number of daily COVID-19 cases has risen by 30% in recent weeks. On 1 Dec 2021, the daily count was 86 000, but on 14 Dec 2021, it had shot up to 117 000.

Omicron was first identified in November [2021] by South African scientists. The discovery of the new variant triggered alarm that it could cause another surge in global infections and led many countries to impose travel restrictions on the southern Africa region. South Africa led a chorus of condemnation against the "unjustified" and "counterproductive" travel bans, as scientists also expressed concerns the curbs would deter other countries from reporting the finding of new variants out of fear of facing similar restrictions.

Health ministers from the G7 of advanced economies on Thursday [16 Dec 2021] called for international cooperation in the face of omicron, which they called the "biggest current threat to global public health."

[4] Immunity following breakthrough infections
Date: Fri 17 Dec 2021

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/12/news-scan-dec-17-2021


COVID-19 breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated US adults substantially boosted humoral immunity and demonstrated cross-neutralization against the delta (B1617.2) variant, despite mostly mild illness, finds a small study yesterday [16 Dec 2021] in JAMA.

Humoral immunity involves antibodies secreted by B cells circulating in bodily fluids.

Oregon Health & Science University researchers recruited 26 fully vaccinated healthcare workers diagnosed as having COVID-19 breakthrough infections and an equal number of matched controls from [31 Jan-18 Aug 2021]. They also sequenced the viral genomes to determine the causative variants.

Average patient age was 38 years, 77% were women, 92% had received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine a median of 28 days after diagnosis and 213.5 days after the 2nd dose, and 81% had mild symptoms.

The boosting effect was most pronounced for immunoglobulin A (IgA), which the study authors said could be because of the differences in route of exposure between vaccination and natural infection.

Sera from breakthrough delta infections showed improved action against delta versus the original strain, at 99%, compared with 36% for non-delta cases and 41% for controls. The study authors said that the finding suggests that the immune response may be broadened through development of variant boosters with antigenic inserts matching emerging variants of concern.

Ten cases with sequenced genomes were delta, while nine were non-delta. Receptor-binding, domain-specific immunoglobulin rose in participants with breakthrough infection (median EC50 [concentration] of 2152, compared with 668 in controls, for a 322% increase). Levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA both increased.

The study authors said that the results predict that the immune response to breakthrough infection is likely to be highly protective against variants such as delta.

In a Oregon Health & Science University news release, senior author Fikadu Tafesse, PhD, said that the results are encouraging. "You can't get a better immune response than this," he said. "Our study suggests that individuals who are vaccinated and then exposed to a breakthrough infection have super immunity."

Breakthrough infections after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 are increasingly reported, possibly due to waning of vaccine-induced antibody levels.(1) Moreover, emerging variants of concern with diminished susceptibility to vaccine-induced antibodies are responsible for most new cases.(2,3) Studies have focused on determining the rate of vaccine breakthrough based on antibody levels after standard vaccination practices.(4,5) We assessed antibody levels and variant cross-neutralization after breakthrough infection.

Discussion
Results of this study showed substantial boosting of humoral immunity after breakthrough infection, despite predominantly mild disease. Boosting was most notable for IgA, possibly due to the differences in route of exposure between vaccination and natural infection. In addition, breakthrough sera demonstrated improved variant cross-neutralization, and delta breakthrough infections in particular exhibited improved potency against delta vs WA1, suggesting that the protective immune response may be broadened through development of variant boosters with antigenic inserts matching the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Limitations of this study include the small number of samples and the difference in time from initial vaccination to serum collection between the breakthrough and control groups, which emerging evidence suggests may contribute to the development of variant cross-neutralizing antibody responses.(6)

Also see EurekAlert https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/938330.

"...The study suggests each exposure following vaccination actually serves to strengthen immune response to subsequent exposures even to new variants of the virus.

"I think this speaks to an eventual end game," said co-author Marcel Curlin, M.D., associate professor of medicine (infectious diseases) in the OHSU School of Medicine who also serves as medical director of OHSU Occupational Health. "It doesn't mean we're at the end of the pandemic, but it points to where we're likely to land: Once you're vaccinated and then exposed to the virus, you're probably going to be reasonably well-protected from future variants.

"Our study implies that the long-term outcome is going to be a tapering-off of the severity of the worldwide epidemic."

Vaccine immunity is currently undergoing a real-world test against the new omicron variant.

"We have not examined the omicron variant specifically, but based on the results of this study we would anticipate that breakthrough infections from the omicron variant will generate a similarly strong immune response among vaccinated people," Tafesse said." - Mod.LK]
