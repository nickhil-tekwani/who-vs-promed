The death of an elephant due to anthrax has sent the West Bengal forest
department into an overdrive at the Jaldapara Wildlife Sanctuary in north
Bengal. Hectic efforts are on to prevent spread of the disease.
"A male elephant was found dead due to anthrax at the Torsa block of the
sanctuary on 27 Jan 2000. We swung into action immediately, cordoning off
the area, setting fire to it and dousing it with litres of disinfectants,"
Arin Ghosh, chief conservator of forests (wildlife wing), West Bengal, told
[news reporters.
Even though forest department officials say the situation is now under
control, they are on alert, keeping account of further casualties, if any.
Ghosh said. "No more deaths have been reported," he added.
Initially, the forest department had considered inoculating the animals in
the sanctuary. "But after an emergency meeting with wildlife experts,
veterinarians and animal welfare officials, we decided not to go for the
inoculation drive as the situation had not gone out of hand," Ghosh said.
Inoculation has to be done by darting the animals, which is costly, time
consuming and dangerous. The vaccine contains live anthrax bacteria spores.
[Usually Sterne vaccine, though the wording suggests they thought
otherwise. - MHJ If one misses the targeted animal, the spores spread out
on the soil. "The spores are very stable in soil and can lie dormant for
months, till they finds an appropriate host animal to multiply," a forest
department officer said. Besides, anthrax contamination can kill human
beings too, he added. [This suggests they were considering using a
Pasteur-type vaccine with a very, very LARGE dart. Oh! - MHJ
Cattle in villages surrounding the sanctuary have been inoculated with
anthrax vaccine. A strict vigil is being maintained to prevent cows from
entering the sanctuary from peripheral villages. Cows are carriers [sic of
the anthrax bacteria Bacillus anthracis, sources in the department said.
[Carriers are unknown in anthrax, though latent infections are believed to
occur. Very different epidemiologically. - MHJ
The male elephant who died on January 27 had got infected from cattle
during one of its raids into villages on the periphery of the park along
Falakata. "Once infected, the bacteria multiplies in the host at a furious
rate, leading to its death in 2 to 24 hours," Subrata Pal Chowdhury,
technical officer of the department said. Profuse blood loss from all body
orifices are tell-tale symptoms of the killer disease. [This suggests that
the bovine anthrax vaccination and control programme was ineffectual in the
area. And death is not that rapid. And "profuse blood loss" is only
characteristic of textbooks. Frequently, anthrax deaths occur without,
which is why it gets missed. - MHJ
"Jaldapara has around 60 Indian one-horned rhinos, the highest
concentration in the state, besides bisons and varieties of deer. Once
anthrax assumes epidemic proportions, it can wipe out the entire herbivore
population of the park in a matter of a few days," state director, World
Wide Fund for Nature, India, Lt Col (retd) S. Banerjee said. Since most of
these animals are endangered, the fear of losing even one of them, sent us
into a flurry of activity, Ghosh pointed out.
In January 1994 too, three elephants died of anthrax at Jaldapara. In an
inoculation drive, 24 rhinos were darted with the anthrax vaccine then.
Only pregnant females and baby rhinos were exempted.

[This is an amazing cocktail of fact and fiction. Maybe someone can provide
us with a more factual account. As elephants are not grazers but medium to
high level browsers any possible infection must be either through consuming
blow-fly contaminated leaves and such, or by tabanid flies. Elephant rabies
has been known in this area since the Raj. Interesting that apparently
cattle vaccination was only begun after the elephant died. This rather
confirms information I have been getting from other parts of India that the
government veterinary services do not regard this disease as important, even
in areas where it is endemic or hyperendemic. - MHJ
