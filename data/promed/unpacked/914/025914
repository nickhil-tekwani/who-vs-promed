West Nile Virus Found in Dead Bird in Windsor, Ontario
------------------------------------------------------
The Windsor Star Newspaper published in Windsor, Ontario, has reported that
a dead crow picked up in this southwestern Ontario city has tested positive
for West Nile virus. The bird, found on 8 Aug 2001, will undergo further
tests to confirm whether this is the first case of the virus entering Canada
since the disease was first found in North America in 1999.
Dr. Allen Heimann, local Medical Officer of Health, said on Fri 17 Aug 2001
that there was no cause for major concern but urged the public to "take
reasonable precautions" against mosquitoes. Children, the elderly and people
with compromised immune systems are at greatest risk. West Nile virus is
spread by mosquitoes that have bitten an infected bird. Blue jays and crows
are [the principal known carriers.
West Nile virus first surfaced on this side of the Atlantic in the New York
area and was responsible for 61 human cases of encephalitis, including 7
deaths in 1999. In 2000, there were 21 confirmed human cases on the U. S.
eastern seaboard, including 2 deaths. [The first human death as a result of
West Nile virus infection in 2001 occurred in Atlanta on 11 Aug 2001. -

[If this observation is confirmed independently, it marks a significant
extension in the known range of West Nile virus in North America. So far no
official confirmation has appeared on the Health Canada web-site. - Mod.CP
