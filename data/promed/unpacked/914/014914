A new milk safety scandal has broken out in China. Authorities in
Shanghai have closed a dairy company and arrested 3 executives, after
milk products were found to contain high levels of the toxic
industrial chemical melamine.

According to the state-run Shanghai Daily, melamine was found in milk
powder and condensed milk made by the Shanghai Panda Dairy Co. Ltd.

Melamine is a toxic chemical used for making plastic. When added to
food it can make the protein content appear higher, but it is highly
detrimental to human health. [As well as other monogastric animals,
such as dogs and cats. - Mod.TG]

Last year, more than 300 000 children were poisoned and at least 6
died after drinking the tainted milk, according to Chinese state-run media.

In a similar incident last month [December 2009], Chinese authorities
also arrested 3 employees of the Shaanxi Jinqiao Diary Company for
producing melamine-tainted milk.

[Melamine is an organic compound, a base with chemical formula
C3H6N6. Officially it is 1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine in the IUPAC
nomenclature system (CAS #108-78-1). It is has a molecular mass of
just over 126, forms a white, crystalline powder, and is only
slightly soluble in water. It is used in fire retardants in polymer
resins because its high nitrogen content is released as
flame-stifling nitrogen gas when the compound is burned or charred.

Melamine has a very high nitrogen content, about 66 percent nitrogen
by mass. This high percentage of nitrogen gives it the analytical
characteristics of protein molecules. Melamine can also be described
as a trimer of cyanamide, 3 cyanamide units joined in a ring.

Melamine is listed on the material safety data sheets as being toxic.
The caveat is that the LD50 is on the order of ordinary table salt.
However, experience has shown, last year or so, that this protein
masquerading compound is not well metabolized by the stomach of
humans or cats or dogs, and since it is poorly soluble in water, it
is poorly excreted through the kidneys, resulting in kidney damage
that may be fatal.

The presumption is the powder was added to boost the protein content
on testing, but given the problems it has caused, one has to wonder
why anyone would want to go down that path of problems we saw with
this substance just last year or so.
