On 9 Sep 1998 the Michigan Agriculture Committee approved a
quarantine of indefinite duration on cattle beginning 1 Jan 1999. The
ban will restrict cattle movements north of Michigan Highway 55 and
east of Interstate Highway 75, an area that includes all of Alcona,
Alpena, Montmorency, Presque Isle and Oscoda Counties and parts of
Otsego, Cheboygan, Roscommon and Crawford Counties.
Dan Wyant, director of the state Agriculture Department said the
commission decided to wait until January to begin the quarantine so
that herd testing now under way could continue without interruption
and to ensure that there are enough veterinarians in the area to help
with the quarantine.
Only one positive cow has been confirmed at this time, although the
disease is known to be present in the wild deer population.
[I asked Mod.MHJ if farmers would try to sell their cattle before the
critical date to circumvent quarantine. He replied:
>>>
Farmers with known (i.e. already tested) reactors can only sell them
for slaughter. If they are not tested, the threat of quarantine
efficiently encourages farmers to facilitate their testing. If the
animals are untested, why sell them if they are making money for you?
"Quarantine" makes a mild hassle to ensure that the farmers get on
with getting their stock tested, and puts community pressure on
laggards.
