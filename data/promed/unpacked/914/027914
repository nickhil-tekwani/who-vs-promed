The north western Chinese region of Ningxia reported a human infection with plague, state television said late on Tuesday [19 Jul 2022]. The caseload of human plague infection, a highly infectious and severe disease, is low in China, with just one in 2021 and no deaths, down from 4 infections and 3 deaths in 2020, according to data from the National Health Commission, which does not specify the types of plague for each person.

The infected person had arrived in Ningxia from an outside area, state television said. It did not provide further details. The latest case was bubonic plague, state television said. Bubonic plague is the commonest form of human plague and less severe than the pneumonia type, which can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated early, the World Health Organization said.

[Plague is caused by _Yersinia pestis_. Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a "bubo". Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated or sometimes without having a preceding bubo, plague bacteria can invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of "primary" plague pneumonia. - Mod.LL
