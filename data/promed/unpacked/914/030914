From: Schechter, Robert <RSCHECHTER@dcdc2.dhs.cahwnet.gov>

Questions on treatment and prevention [of pigbel:
1) Given that Pigbel is mediated by _C. perfringens_ beta toxin, has
passive immunotherapy, such as breast milk from immune mothers been helpful
as part of treatment (if the patient can still be fed)?
2) In a lecture at an ASM-sponsored conference in 1995, I believe that Greg
Lawrence mentioned that the successful, cheap _C. perfringens_ beta toxoid
vaccine, originally developed for veterinary use, was in short supply due
to its lack of profitability. Can anyone confirm this and provide an update
on vaccine supply?

[_C. perfringens_ type B causes lamb dysentery. The common veterinary
vaccines in available in the United States only include _C. perfringens_
type C and D. The manufacturer claims that "some protection" against type B
is offered by their vaccines. I suspect a vaccine against type B is readily
available in Europe, Africa and the Middle East where lamb dysentery is
more common. - Mod.PC
