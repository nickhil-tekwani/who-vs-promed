It is with a heavy heart that we announce the passing of Dr. Abdelali Benkirane on Tue 13 Nov 2018 following a long struggle with illness. Abdelali is survived by his wife and children. May Abdelali 's soul rest in peace in God's safe hands, and we extend our deepest condolences and sympathies to his family and friends during these sad times.

Abdelali was an exemplary member of ProMED-mail MENA and FRA (Francophone Africa) in his own right. He was a highly competent and productive colleague, covering topics relevant to veterinary medicine.

Furthermore, Abdelali was a respected professor at Institut Agronomique et Veterinaire Hassan II, Morocco. His research work mainly encompassed the epidemiological surveillance of disease-causing infectious agents in veterinary settings as well as their vaccination implications.

Personally, Abdelali was a dear colleague and friend of mine; I remember the nice times we spent together with friends during our ProMED trips, visiting museums and archeological sites and going to concerts and operas while in Vienna. I also learned from a conversation with his wife that he was a loving husband and an affectionate father.

The ProMED family and scientific community have lost a great member. Abdelali will be dearly missed. May his soul rest in peace.

ProMED was very lucky to have had Ali join us as an animal health moderator when we launched the ProMED-MENA (Middle East and North Africa Network). In addition to having been a professor at the Institut Agronomique et Veterinaire Hassan II, Morocco, Ali had worked with the FAO in the past. Following official retirement, Ali, fluent in English, Arabic, and French, offered to work on the ProMED-FRA (Francophone Africa) and the ProMED-EAFR (Anglophone Africa) network as an animal health moderator, and was a prolific producer of excellent, high-quality reports on events of interest to all 3 regions.

We will sorely miss Ali and his contributions, as well as his wit and insight into emerging diseases on the African continent and the Middle East.
