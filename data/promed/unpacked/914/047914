Hepatitis Cases Lurk Unchecked in Indonesia
----------------------
Hidden symptoms and a strong stigma are reasons many people with hepatitis B and C do not know they are infected, a medical researcher said on Friday [20 Jul 2012]. Only 10 percent to 20 percent of hepatitis cases are detected, said Rino Gani, head of the Indonesia Liver Research Association (PPHI). "Not everyone knows about the status of their infection and not everyone has had themselves examined," Rino said at a news conference ahead of World Hepatitis Day on 28 Jul 2012. Hepatitis takes a long time to show symptoms, but the disease can cause liver cirrhosis and cancer, Rino said. "The damage only becomes known when it is already too late and not much can be done," Rino said. One of the problems is money, Rino said. Tests and treatment are only affordable for a small segment of society. Another is stigma. People who know they are infected often do not seek out treatment because they do not want people to know about their condition. Since the disease does not cause them pain, they are able to ignore it.

According to H.M. Subuh, a director at the Health Ministry, rapid detection tests cost between Rp 30 000 [USD 3.18] and Rp 50 000 [5.29], and more sophisticated tests cost Rp 100 000 to Rp 150 000. [One USD approximates to 9445 Indonesian Rupiah]. "The problem is that after someone is declared hepatitis B or C positive, another series of tests have to be undergone and the costs is about Rp 2 million [USD 211.75] and has to be done repeatedly before being eligible for therapy" which can cost tens or hundreds of millions of rupiah, he said. The government's Jamkesmas health insurance scheme covers treatment for poor people, he added. Rino said an alternative to expensive therapies was needed. He praised a partnership between the University of Indonesia and the University of Kobe in Japan to develop an herbal-based cure for hepatitis C.

A 2007 Health Ministry study found that 9.4 percent of Indonesians, or about 30 million people, were positive for hepatitis B or C. Globally, 170 million people are infected, and the disease[s] causes 1.5 million deaths annually. Several groups are especially vulnerable to hepatitis, including health workers, intravenous drug users and children whose mothers are infected, Rino said. Soldiers also carry a high risk of infection because of bleeding during exercise or sharing razors. Unsterile tattooing can also spread hepatitis.

[Hepatitis B is a potentially life-threatening liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus. It is a major global health problem and the most serious type of viral hepatitis. It can cause chronic liver disease and puts people at high risk of death from cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. Worldwide, an estimated 2 billion people have been infected with the hepatitis B virus and more than 240 million have chronic (long-term) liver infections. About 600 000 people die every year due to the acute or chronic consequences of hepatitis. Hepatitis B virus is transmitted between people by direct blood-to-blood contact or semen and vaginal fluid of an infected person. Modes of transmission are the same as those for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but the hepatitis B virus is 50 to 100 times more infectious. Unlike HIV, the hepatitis B virus can survive outside the body for at least 7 days. During this time, the virus can still cause infection if it enters the body of a person who is not protected by the vaccine. A vaccine against hepatitis B has been available since 1982. Hepatitis B vaccine is 95 percent effective in preventing infection and its chronic consequences, and is the 1st vaccine against a major human cancer. (For more detailed information, see http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs204/en/index.html).

Hepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with the hepatitis C virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C virus is usually spread when blood from an infected person enters the body of a susceptible person. It is among the most common viruses that infect the liver. Every year, 3-4 million people are infected with the hepatitis C virus. About 150 million people are chronically infected and at risk of developing liver cirrhosis and/or liver cancer. More than 350 000 people die from hepatitis C-related liver diseases every year. Hepatitis C may be transmitted through sex with an infected person or sharing of personal items contaminated with infectious blood, but these are less common. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food or water or by casual contact such as hugging, kissing and sharing food or drinks with an infected person. There is no generally available vaccine for prevention of hepatitis C virus infection. However antiviral drugs are becoming available which are effective in the treatment of hepatitis caused by some strains of hepatitis C virus. (For more detailed information, see: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs164/en/index.html).

The World Health Organisation also organizes World Hepatitis Day on 28 July every year to increase awareness and understanding of viral hepatitis.
