CJD (NEW VAR.), 7TH CASE - FRANCE: CORRECTION
***********************************************

Correction to Agence France Presse report
---------------------------------------------
[Dr. Isabelle Capek, of the Institut de Veille Sanitaire, Saint-Maurice,
has sent the following statement to correct some of the information in the
ProMed-mail post of Fri 2 Jul 2004, entitled: "CJD (new var.), 7th case -
France: susp. archive number 20040703.1783. ProMED-mail greatly appreciates
Dr. Capek's assistance in this matter. - Mod.CP]
We confirm that the 7th case of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
[abbreviated as CJD (new var.) or vCJD in ProMED-mail] has been identified
and that this information has been published on our website at:
<http://www.invs.sante.fr/display/?doc=publications/mcj/donnees_mcj.html>.
However, the information in the Agence France Presse (AFP) report
concerning the 7th case of vCJD is erroneous. The 7th-case-vCJD-patient is
alive, and the case described in the AFP report is not a vCJD case.
In addition, the moderator's comment mentioned a suspected case, which had
been reported earlier in Guadeloupe. Guadeloupe is part of France and
covered by our surveillance system. No suspected variant case has ever been
reported in Guadeloupe.

[On 30 May 2001, ProMED-mail posted a report, from the Daily News newspaper
of 26 May 2001 (see reference below), describing 3 possible cases of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in Guadeloupe. The text of the report stated
that: "According to the French government's top official in Guadeloupe,
Jean Francois Carenco, one of the 3 cases [may be] suffering from variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), the human variation of the disease linked
to the consumption of beef infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE; known also as mad cow disease). The other 2 cases are suspected to be
another form of the fatal ailment not linked to eating infected meat
[sporadic or familial CJD], he said." This information was reproduced in
good faith, and we are indebted again to Dr. Capek for her correction of
this misinformation. - Mod.CP]
