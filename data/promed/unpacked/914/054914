Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 4 Oct 2020
Date of confirmation of the event: 21 Nov 2020
Report date: 24 Nov 2020
Date submitted to OIE: 25 Nov 2020
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease in the country
Causal agent: lumpy skin disease virus
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory (basic and advanced), necropsy
This event pertains to the whole country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Sai Kung, Sai Kung, Hong Kong
Date of start of the outbreak: 4 Oct 2020
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: other
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / - / - / - / 4 / 0
Affected population: There is a population of approximately 1200 feral cattle scattered throughout Hong Kong countryside and country parks. Since October [2020], clinical signs have become evident in herds located distantly from each other; 20-30% of animals of certain herds, especially in Sai Kung and Mui Wo, are affected.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: Reported generalized skin nodules and/or mucosal ulcers in several different populations of the feral cattle in October 2020. A few showed systemic signs such as fever and weakness. Increasing morbidity and low mortality. Skin biopsies submitted on 27 Oct [2020] had necrotizing vasculitis and infarcts under light microscopy. Two cattle were submitted on 30 Oct [2020] for post-mortem examination. Sheep pox cells, ballooning degeneration were identified under histopathology exam in addition to necrotizing vasculitis. Subsequent molecular and serology results from OIE reference laboratory for PCR and ELISA has confirmed the disease as lumpy skin disease. The majority of cattle in Hong Kong are feral animals, which are not involved in livestock trade activities. Risk assessment and management plan is being drafted.

Control measures
Measures applied: selective killing and disposal; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Results
Tai Lung Veterinary Laboratory, Agriculture Fisheries and Conservation Department (national laboratory) / cattle / histopathological examination / 12 Nov 2020 / positive
The Pirbright Institute (OIE reference laboratory) / cattle / enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) / 21 Nov 2020 / positive
The Pirbright Institute (OIE reference laboratory) / cattle / real-time PCR / 21 Nov 2020 / positive

Future reporting
