According to the Nepal Department of Health, anti-rabies vaccine for humans
is only available in 46/75 districts; for animals they are available in 50
districts. Thus 26 districts lack vaccine and must depend on DHS resources
when there is a need. Even then, some 18 000 to 20 000 people are given
anti-rabies vaccinations each year. But it is clear that in some districts
the human rabies death rate is 2 - 3 times higher than reported; nationally
it may be 3 to 4-fold higher. This high incidence is put down to the rapid
increase in numbers of stray dogs. Canine rabies control is deficient.
Rabies is a serious problem in densely populated areas, such as the Terai,
the inner Terai and valleys; the Terai is the lowland part of Nepal
adjoining India. According to the Rabies Surveillance & Prevention unit,
about 8 out of every 10 000 people complain of dog bites.

[We wonder about the round figures given for the number of bites in Lamahi,
Terathum & Gulariya, and why "18 000 to 20 000 people are given anti-rabies
vaccinations each year" when only 14 372 were recorded as having been
bitten. But whatever the real figures, the problem is serious & costly.
One would think dog control would be cheaper than vaccinating all those
people - Mod.JW
