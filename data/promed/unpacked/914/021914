_E. coli_ outbreak with unknown food source
-------------------------------------------
Fast Facts
Illnesses: 29
Hospitalizations: 9
Deaths: 0
States: 2
Recall: no
Investigation status: active

CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, the FDA, and the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) are collecting different types of data to identify the food source of a multistate outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infections. So far, illnesses have only been reported from Michigan and Ohio. A food has not yet been identified as the source and this investigation is ongoing.

Epidemiologic and laboratory data
---------------------------------
Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. CDC PulseNet manages a national database of DNA fingerprints of bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses. DNA fingerprinting is performed on bacteria using a method called whole genome sequencing (WGS).

Michigan and Ohio have both reported large increases in the number of _E. coli_ infections in their states. Some of these illnesses have not yet been reported to the PulseNet system, but investigators are working quickly to add them to PulseNet to determine if they may be part of this outbreak. WGS from the illnesses in PulseNet showed that bacteria from sick people's samples are closely related genetically. This suggests that people in this outbreak got sick from the same food.

As of 16 Aug 2022, a total of 29 people infected with the outbreak strain of _E. coli_ O157:H7 have been reported to CDC from 2 states. Illnesses started on dates ranging from 26 Jul 2022 to 6 Aug 2022 (see timeline https://www.cdc.gov/ecoli/2022/o157h7-08-22/epi.html).

State of Residence / Number of Sick People
------------------------------------------
Michigan / 15
Ohio / 14

Sick people range in age from 6 to 91 years, with a median age of 21 years, and 38% are female. Of 17 people with information available, 9 have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

As mentioned above, the true number of sick people in an outbreak is likely higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because some of the recent illnesses have not yet been reported to PulseNet as it usually takes 3 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak. In addition, some people recover without medical care and are not tested for _E. coli_. State and local public health officials are interviewing people about the foods they ate in the week before they got sick.

Public health actions
---------------------
Investigators are working quickly to identify the source of these infections. If a food item is identified, investigators will issue advice for people and businesses. People who are sick with _E. coli_ symptoms should report their illnesses to their local or state health department. In general, to prevent getting sick from _E. coli_, follow these 4 steps when handling or preparing food: clean, separate, cook, and chill.

[As previously suspected, CDC has confirmed at least some of the EHEC cases in Michigan and Ohio are related with a substantial number of the Michigan cases not yet confirmed to be the outbreak organism by WGS. The serotype is now identified as O157:H7, the prototypical strain of EHEC. We await more information regarding the scope of the outbreak regarding numbers, other states, and what the vehicle for transmission is.

ProMED thanks James Golsby for the submission. - Mod.LL
