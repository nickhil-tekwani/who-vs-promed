"The health department posted an advisory late Thursday against swimming or
skiing in Lake Springfield ... The suspected cases of leptospirosis have
now increased to 71, said Jeff Johnson, spokesman for the Department of
Public Health .... Initially, the outbreak was linked to symptoms reported
by participants in a June 21 triathlon. However, as of Saturday, 35 people
who did not swim in the triathalon also have reported similar symptoms,
according to Johnson. Representatives for the Centers for Disease Control
have arrived in Springfield and are now working with investigators to
locate the suspected source of the bacteria, Johnson said."
I've [discarded the earlier newspaper reports, but I do remember that a
feeder creek to the lake near a hog and cattle operation had been tested
and no contamination was detected. A residential group around the lake
suspects the unusually large population of geese this year as a possible
source, but this was downplayed because the bacteria are carried in
mammals. And a local veterinarian had treated a dog which lived at the lake
for symptoms similar to leptospirosis a few weeks before the triathalon,
but could not confirm [the diagnosis.

[Obviously, until there is hard evidence we will continue to get the merely
anecdotal, and red-herrings will abound. It will be interesting to see what
relevance the "35 symptomatic non-swimmers" will have. - Mod.MHJ
