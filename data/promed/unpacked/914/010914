Nearly 700 people have reported becoming ill after eating food from
the Pars Cove Persian Cuisine booth at the Taste of Chicago
[festival]. A total of 28 people are known to have been hospitalized
because of illness suffered after eating the tainted food, according
to a release from the city Department of Public Health (CDPH).
As of noon Thu 19 Jul 2007, a total of 696 people have reported that
they became ill after they ate food purchased from the Pars Cove
booth, the release said. While that is up slightly from the total of
678 that had been reported by midday the day before [18 Jul 2007],
the CDPH says "reports of illnesses related to the Pars Cove Persian
Cuisine booth at Taste of Chicago are slowing down considerably."
Of 678 cases, 97 are laboratory-confirmed cases of salmonellosis,
with more results pending, the release said. Of the 97, 60 have been
identified as _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Heidelberg.
Most of the individuals live in the Chicago area; a few are from
downstate and a few are from other states.

[As the festival has been over for 12 days, ending on 8 Jul 2007, it
is not surprising that at this point the number of reported cases is
leveling off. - Mod.LL]
