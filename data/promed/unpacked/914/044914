A survey conducted in North Dakota in 2010 found the ticks that carry Lyme disease bacteria (_Ixodes scapularis_, or deer ticks), marking their 1st known appearance in the state and showing that they are spreading westward, according to a study in the September [2014] Journal of Medical Entomology [1].

The researchers collected 1762 ticks through sampling at sites in 9 counties around North Dakota in the early summer of 2010. Most of the ticks (82 percent) were _Dermacentor variabilis_, but 17 percent were _I. scapularis_, found in 6 eastern counties.

In one county (Grand Forks), 3 _I. scapularis_ ticks tested positive for _Borrelia burgdorferi_, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. Another 8 ticks in the county were infected with _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_, which causes anaplasmosis.

The report notes that Lyme disease cases were rare in North Dakota before 2007 but have increased somewhat since then, with most reported in eastern counties.

"This is the 1st report of _I. scapularis_ and associated pathogens occurring in North Dakota and provides evidence for continued westward expansion of this important vector tick species in the United States," the report says.

Abstract
--------
"Ticks were sampled at 9 locations throughout North Dakota during early summer of 2010, using flagging techniques and small mammals trapping. In total, 1762 ticks were collected from 8 of the 9 locations. The dominant species were _Dermacentor variabilis_ (Say) (82 percent), found throughout the state, and _Ixodes scapularis_ (Say) (17 percent), found in northeastern counties. A few nymphal and adult _I. scapularis_ tested positive for _Borrelia burgdorferi_ (3 percent) and _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ (8 percent). This is the 1st report of _I. scapularis_ and associated pathogens occurring in North Dakota and provides evidence for continued westward expansion of this important vector tick species in the United States."

North Dakota, which had no cases of Lyme disease in 2004, had between 8 and 22 confirmed cases reported annually since 2007 (http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/chartstables/reportedcases_statelocality.html). In 2013, 12 confirmed cases of Lyme disease were reported in North Dakota. Since Lyme disease is reported by county of residence, not acquisition, some of these cases could have been imported into the state when a North Dakota resident was on vacation in a Lyme endemic state. - Mod.ML
