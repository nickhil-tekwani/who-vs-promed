[_Bacillus anthracis_ is very capable of catching and publicly spotlighting farmers and ranchers who are procrastinators and not vaccinating their animals. They have been told that there is a risk. They have been told to vaccinate. And for whatever reason, they don't and then pay for it publicly. Tragic for them and their animals, but a clear warning to the rest. Vaccinate!

This official report does not state that this farm had any cases in 2021, so I suspect what might have happened is that one always has more farms affected than are reported, usually either because of the farmer disregarding the animals that died or being embarrassed and not wanting the attention. And as a result, any carcasses of affected animals were not properly disposed of. This would have left contaminated soil, which the grazing sheep found this summer when the high temperatures reduced their innate resistance, and a minimal exposure is enough to initiate a lethal infection. Whereas a single dead cow can result in a call to the farmer's veterinarian, sheep are not so valuable, and such a call will occur when a financially attention-grabbing number have died.

It is now clear that Extremadura must, if they haven't already, initiate a provincial control and surveillance programme, including annual vaccination of the livestock, cattle, horses, sheep, and goats. For the next 5 years. And one thing I can promise, based on many years of experience with this disease in many countries, the procrastinators will demonstrate the ongoing risk of not vaccinating. Experience says that if there have not been any new outbreaks in 8 years, one may have succeeded, and surveillance is then adequate. _Bacillus anthracis_ has a reputation of being immortal. It isn't. The spores die, and before that they lose their plasmids, resulting in apathogenic spores. And take note: thanks to many successful control programmes, this disease has been eradicated in numerous countries in Europe, in American and Canadian states and provinces, and elsewhere. It is hard work but one of the easiest diseases to eradicate.

Many thanks to Mod.CRD who forwarded this WOAH report to me. - Mod.MHJ
