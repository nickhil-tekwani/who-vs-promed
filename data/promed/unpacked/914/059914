[The report contains 2 outbreaks, one in poultry and in a single wild
bird, a partridge. Further details of the suspected contact of the
partridge with infected migratory birds would be appreciated. We have
much to learn about the interface between migratory birds and the
local avian populations. This report demonstrates not only that avian
influenza can be spread by migratory birds, but also other diseases,
including Newcastle and Salmonella. - Mod.PC]
