A disease striking down Scotland's sparrows and starlings is baffling
scientists. The strange nerve condition leaves young birds unable to fly.
Instead, they walk round in tight circles, do somersaults, and twist their
heads.
The condition has only been reported in Scotland, and experts at the
Scottish Agricultural College's (SAC) Veterinary Science Division first
believed it was the West Nile virus, an illness transmitted by mosquitos
that has killed several people in the US this year.
However, tests on the birds' swollen brains proved negative, and the team
has drawn a blank in identifying the disease. They have no idea whether it
could affect humans or animals.
SAC vet Tom Pennycott said: "I'm glad to say it wasn't West Nile [virus
disease], or any of the related viruses. We are carrying out further tests
and focusing on whether protozoa, single cells larger than viruses or
bacteria, are to blame. Approximately 20 cases are now being reported
annually. It's mysterious. I find it hard to believe it is confined to
Scotland and hope any other cases spotted in the UK will be brought to our
attention."

Britain's sparrows and starlings are dying from an unknown disease. While
tests have ruled out West Nile virus, which is transmitted by mosquitoes
and has killed several people in the US this year, researchers have no idea
what is to blame or if humans could be affected.
Ornithologists in Scotland have reported several cases of a strange
neurological condition since 1994. Young birds with the disease can't fly,
instead walking round in tight circles, doing somersaults and twisting
their heads bizarrely.
Now the swollen brains of birds that died of the disease have been analyzed
for the first time, because of fears it might be West Nile [virus disease].
Tom Pennycott of the Scottish Agricultural College's Veterinary Science
Division in Ayr says so far his team has drawn a complete blank when it
comes to identifying the disease.
Conservationists were already concerned about the widespread decline in the
numbers of sparrows and starlings across Britain. But the mystery disease is
unlikely to be the cause, because the only cases so far have been in
Scotland. "We've not found an answer to the decline, but we've found a new
mystery," says Pennycott. "We're not talking big numbers, but it's
certainly there and it might be the tip of the iceberg," he adds.
Pennycott may have found other clues about the cause of the decline. In work
not yet published, he found the salmonella food-poisoning bacteria in 2/3 of
the dead sparrows brought to him. A paper in this week's Nature, however,
blames the decline on changes in farming practices that mean there's less
food for birds in winter.

[The articles specify the birds are negative for West Nile virus and some
other encephalopathies. It would be nice to know which other
encephalopathies were tested for, whether Avian Vacuolar Myelinopathy was
tested for, and what histopathology was done. Without more information
regarding pathology or tests performed, it is difficult to establish a list
of possible differential diagnoses. - Mod.TG]
