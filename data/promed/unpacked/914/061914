There is evidence passerines or song birds kept as pets, might serve as a
source or reservoir for avian influenza viruses. However, the role
passerines or song birds play in the natural history of avian influenza
viruses circulating in birds (wild and domestic) is not defined.
Since avian influenza infections are probably not uncommon in passerines or
song birds found in bird markets in Asia, or at least in birds originating
from Asia, I would consider them to be potential sources of avian influenza
viruses and possibly potential reservoirs. The mixing of pet birds and
commercial poultry in live bird markets is not uncommon in many parts of
the world and obviously presents opportunities for two-way transmission of
viruses between commercial poultry and pet birds. This is a situation that
should not be overlooked in efforts to prevent and control avian influenza
anywhere in the world.
1. The best overall review of the host range of avian influenza viruses in
birds is provided by Drs. Stallknecht and Shane (Vet. Res. Comm.
12:125-141). Dr. Stallknecht updated this topic at the Third International
Symposium on Avian Influenza (1992) and at the Fourth International
Symposium on Avian Influenza (1997). His paper given at the Third
International Symposium on Avian Influenza can be found on pages 98-104 of
the proceedings. His paper given at the Fourth International Symposium on
Avian Influenza will be included in the proceedings which should be
available in February 1998. Also, many related papers, given by other
speakers, can be found in the proceedings of these and previous proceedings
of International Symposia on Avian Influenza. Of special note are reports
on the recovery of avian influenza viruses from non-poultry species being
imported into England (Alexander) and United States (Pearson, Senne,and
Panigrahy). Passerines are included in the lists of aves infected with
type A influenza viruses (avian influenza viruses).
2. Avian influenza infections in non-poultry avian species originating
from Asia were first detected in birds being imported into California
during 1972. These isolates were obtained from dead birds sampled during
quarantine as part of the viscerotropic velogenic Newcastle disease
eradication project. The viruses represented several
hemagglutinin-neuraminidase combinations. The source of the viruses and
when the birds were infected were not determined.(Avian Diseases 17:
458-459, 1972; Avian Diseases 17: 746-751, 1973).
3. During the late 1970s Dr. Thomas Ksiazek recovered numerous avian
influenza viruses from dead birds in pet bird markets in Jakarta,
Indonesia. These viruses possessed several hemagglutinin and neuraminidase
subtype combinations. It was not determined if the birds were being
infected in the wild or after capture (Unpublished data).

[Thanks to Dr. Slemons (and to Dr. David Swayne for similar comments) for
this information. It appears that surveillance in passerines is needed in
order to find out if they are involved. Clearly, any notion that dogs or
cats are involved does not have much scientific support. Avian influenza,
known to farmers as fowl plague, has been around since 1878. It has
occurred regularly on poultry, swine and horse farms all over the world.
Dogs, cats and rodents, normal fauna on most farms, surely have availed
themselves of gnawing on avian influenza affected chicken carcasses from
time to time. These animals have never been implicated in field
transmission of avian influenza virus.
Let's hope that chicken flock depopulation works in Hong Kong. It is the
standard method for stopping the spread of avian influenza among farms when
outbreaks occur in chicken raising areas worldwide. If you remove the
source, you stop the spread of infection.
It appears there would be three likely sources for new cases: other aves,
clandestine poultry and human to human transmission. I would still like to
have more information on the potential role of swine (not to mention humans
and birds) in Guangdong province. - Mod.PC
