Emergency situation is announced in the South of Kyrgyzstan because
of anthrax outbreak
----------------------------------------------------------------------
An emergency situation has been established because of an anthrax
outbreak in the [Kadamdzhay] region of Batken oblast. Two [foci] of
infection have been registered in the villages of Uchkorgon and
Markaz. The local authority reported that 11 people are in the
hospital with suspicion of anthrax and for 5 of them the diagnosis
has been confirmed. One patient is in critical condition. The deputy
head of the district administration, Turgunbay Aytmatova, added that
the patients have all necessary supplies for adequate treatment.

[About 30 cases of anthrax have been registered in Osh, Chuy, and
Jalal-Abad oblasts [provinces] of Kyrgyzstan this year (2008). Batken
oblast updated the list of affected territories. The causes of the
spread of infection were mentioned in ProMED-mail reports previously.
The origin of the problem is the lack of appropriate veterinary
control over farm animals. It is interesting that outbreaks of
foot-and-mouth disease were recorded in the same regions during
2006-2007. The recent outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in cattle
has been handled successfully in Kyrgyzstan, however it seems that
the veterinary service is employing a narrowly defined, rather than a
system wide approach in this republic. - Mod.NP

The BBC has picked up this story and reported it at
<http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/1555091/anthrax_emergency_declared_in_southern_kyrgyz_district/>

"The Batken oblast/province is to the west of Osh and is surrounded
by Tajikistan. It is essentially mountain ranges with a few strung
out valleys narrowly winding into the mountains. Isolated. The
Kadamdzhay raion/district/county is in the top right quadrant of
Batken and has a significant amount of sand hills in its centre. The
northern border is in the Fergana valley so unless Uchkorgon & Markaz
are tucked away in the hills they are more likely to be sharing the
Fergana ecosystem and the ongoing disease hazards of that region, as
do the Kyrgyz oblasts of Osh and Jalalabad."
