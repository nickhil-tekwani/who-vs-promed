On 3 Mar 2021, an outbreak of African swine fever [ASF] has been confirmed in piglets being illegally transported through Funing county in China's southwestern province of Yunnan, the farm ministry said. The case comes amid growing concern that a severe wave of disease in recent months has hit China's hog herd, the world's largest. Six out of the 36 pigs had died, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said in a statement late on Tuesday [2 Mar 2021], while 6 more in the truck were sick.

Beijing reports few disease outbreaks on Chinese farms, but some analysts have recently estimated that about 1/5 of the breeding herd in northern China was affected over the winter.

African swine fever is usually fatal to pigs, but recent studies have identified some less lethal variants circulating in China [see comment].

[The information above about the less lethal ASF variants in China has been recently subject to a scientific study published in a Chinese journal (reference below). From the said paper, we introduce the abstract and selected segments from the discussion chapter:

1. Abstract

"African swine fever virus (ASFV) has been circulating in China for more than 2 years, and it is not clear whether the biological properties of the virus have changed. Here, we report on our surveillance of ASFVs in 7 provinces of China, from June to December 2020. A total of 22 viruses were isolated and characterized as genotype II ASFVs, with mutations, deletions, insertions, or short-fragment replacement occurring in all isolates compared with Pig/HLJ/2018 (HLJ/18), the earliest isolate in China. Eleven isolates had 4 different types of natural mutations or deletion in the EP402R gene and displayed a non-hemadsorbing (non-HAD) phenotype. Four isolates were tested for virulence in pigs; 2 were found to be as highly lethal as HLJ/18. However, 2 non-HAD isolates showed lower virulence but were highly transmissible; infection with 10^6 TCID50 dose was partially lethal and caused acute or sub-acute disease, whereas 10^3 TCID50 dose caused non-lethal, sub-acute or chronic disease, and persistent infection. The emergence of lower virulent natural mutants brings greater difficulty to the early diagnosis of ASF and creates new challenges for ASFV control."

2. Discussion (selected segments; for the omitted references, please refer to the full paper)

"Genotype II ASFV strains, which are endemic in Eastern Europe, Russia, China, and other Southeast Asia regions, mainly exhibit high virulence in pigs, except for isolates Estonia/WB/2014 and Lv17/WB/Rie1. Estonia/WB/2014 was isolated from wild boar in Estonia in 2014 and had a deletion of 14 560 nucleotides at the 5â€² end. Animal studies showed that the Estonia/WB/2014 was lethal in wild boar, but did not kill any domestic pigs, although the infected domestic pigs developed disease signs, including lethargy, reduced feed intake, and fever. Lv17/WB/Rie1 was isolated from a hunted wild boar in Latvia in 2017, had a nucleotide deletion at site 395 of its EP402R gene, which caused the loss of expression of CD2v, and had reduced virulence in domestic pigs. In the present study, the 11 non-HAD mutants detected in China have 4 different kinds of genetic changes in the EP402R gene, which all resulted in the deletion of the CD2v protein. Although we only tested and confirmed the partial attenuation of 2 viruses in pigs, it is reasonable to speculate that all of the 11 non-HAD viruses are partially attenuated in pigs. These facts indicate that ASFVs may lose CD2v protein through different strategies during their circulation in pigs, which is probably a compromise of ASFVs to the host's antiviral response, but the underlying mechanism is still unclear.

"Currently, there are no commercial vaccines or specific treatments available for ASF. Therefore, control of the disease relies on the rapid diagnosis and culling of infected animals. The emergence of the non-HAD mutants will cause more problems and pose bigger challenge for the ASF control in China since they cause a much more delayed course, and mild, chronic disease signs, while being continuously shed via the oral and rectal routes. Recently, we developed a safe and efficient 7-gene-deleted live vaccine (HLJ/18-7GD) based on HLJ/18. The protective efficacy of the HLJ/18-7GD vaccine against these newly emerged, lower virulent strains need to be urgently evaluated."

On top of ASF, which reportedly started its circulation in China in August 2018, China's livestock industry has been plagued by 2 other recently introduced viral diseases that are high on OIE's list of transboundary animal diseases, namely lumpy skin disease in cattle and PPR [peste des petits ruminants] in small ruminants (sheep and goats). Fortunately, and in difference with ASF, potent vaccines against these 2 diseases are commercially available.
