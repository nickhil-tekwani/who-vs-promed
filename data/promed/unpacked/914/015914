Toronto is reporting a meningococcal disease outbreak which has left one person dead and 2 others infected with the bacterial infection. The 3 cases are individuals between 20 and 30 years old who began experiencing symptoms between 15-17 Jul 2022, according to a news release from Toronto Public Health (TPH) on Thursday [25 Aug 2022].

The health unit says the infected individuals were born outside of Canada, in countries that don't provide childhood immunization against the disease. It is unknown where the infected individuals were born.

"TPH has not been able to identify a link between these cases. All 3 individuals have recently been confirmed to have the same rare strain of serogroup C meningococcal disease," the release reads.

Most invasive meningococcal infections are associated with a bacteria called _Neisseria meningitidis_, which causes an infection to the lining of the brain, spinal cord and bloodstream. "People spread meningococcal bacteria to other people by sharing respiratory and throat secretions (saliva or spit). Generally, it takes close or lengthy contact to spread these bacteria," TPH says. More specifically, the infection can be spread by kissing, coughing, and sharing common items such as eating utensils, cups, cigarettes, and musical instruments.

Symptoms of the infection include a fever, aches, joint pain, headache, stiff neck and photophobia. The disease is known to progress quickly, and complications include low blood pressure, seizures, loss of hearing, amputations, brain damage or death.

The bacterial infection is relatively rare in Toronto since there are routine vaccinations available for residents. "So most people will be immunized both around one year of age and again in high school. So that we know most students in Toronto will have received the vaccine. And we're concerned about anyone who hasn't received the vaccine either because they were not immunized here, or because they came from a country where vaccine is not routinely available," Dr. Rita Shahin told CP24 Thursday morning [25 Aug 2022].

TPH is encouraging adults between 20 and 36 years old to get the meningococcal disease vaccine as soon as possible if they have not done so yet. The vaccines are 97% effective in infants within one year of vaccination and effectiveness decreases to 68% after one year, according to TPH. Shahin says most people immunized against the disease will not develop any symptoms.

The health unit says it is monitoring vaccine demand and is "actively exploring additional vaccination channels."

TPH added that the last outbreak it is aware of occurred in 2001, when there were 6 reported cases and 2 deaths.

More information on the disease can be found on the city's website (https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/health-wellness-care/diseases-medications-vaccines/meningococcal-type-c-vaccine/).

[We are not given much information about this outbreak in the news report above, except that the 3 individuals with invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) are 20-30 years of age, without "a link between these cases,"and the 3 individuals are infected with the "same rare strain of serogroup C" meningococcus. This rare strain is not characterized further in the news report above; however, a hypervirulent serogroup C strain of _Neisseria meningitidis_ belonging to the sequence type (ST) 11 is known to be causing outbreaks among men who have sex with men (MSM) since 2001.

In 2001, an outbreak of IMD was reported among MSM in Toronto (https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto-issues-meningitis-warning-to-gay-men-1.266080). Subsequently, clusters of IMD, e.g., meningitis and bloodstream infection, among MSM have been reported in other cities in North America, Europe and Australia, associated with a high case fatality rate; all cases were caused by hypervirulent serogroup C strains of _Neisseria meningitidis_ belonging to sequence type (ST) 11 (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0160126). In addition to Toronto in 2001, outbreaks have occurred in Chicago (2003), New York (2010-13), Paris (2014), Berlin (2012-13), southern California (2012-16), and Victoria, Australia (2017). Currently, there is a large ongoing outbreak of serogroup C IMD among MSM in Florida. This outbreak in Florida is mostly affecting people who live in Florida but also involves non-residents who had traveled to Florida (https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/outbreaks/FL2022.html#serogroup-c-outbreak).

Increased international travel to attend large gatherings, in crowded venues, in the context of Gay Pride and other festivals may be a factor facilitating the spread of the serogroup C IMD among MSM, as it has monkeypox. Vaccination campaigns using meningococcal C vaccine in MSM have been encouraged by the US CDC and European health authorities (https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/outbreaks/FL2022.html).

Although _N. meningitidis_ normally colonize the mucosal surfaces of the nasopharynx, members of the meningococcal ST-11 clade have also genetically adapted to the urogenital tract, facilitating transmission via oro-genital sexual contact to cause outbreaks of meningococcal urethritis presenting at sexually transmitted infections (STI) clinics in multiple US cities in recent years (Ohio, California, Michigan, Indiana, Georgia and other states) (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6521a5.htm and https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-018-4560-x). Meningococcal isolates from MSM with IMD in Germany have been found to be genetically similar to strains from urethritis in MSM, suggesting that sexual transmission may have been playing a role in the emergence of serogroup C IMD among MSM (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4972413/).

More information would be appreciated on the current outbreak of IMD in Toronto due to a rare strain of meningococcus serogroup C from knowledgeable sources.

Toronto (pop., about 2.8 million residents in 2021) is the capital city of the Canadian province of Ontario (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto). A map showing the location of Toronto can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Toronto,+ON,+Canada. - Mod.ML
