HEMORRHAGIC FEVER WITH RENAL SYNDROME - TAIWAN
***********************************************
A ProMED-mail post

From: Chan-Hsien Chiu <jhchuang@cdc.gov.tw> and

Taiwan's Center for Disease Control [TCDC] was notified of a cluster
of 3 laboratory-confirmed cases of Hanta hemorrhagic fever with renal
syndrome (HFRS) in May 2006. The 3 patients are roommates and
servicemen in the Navy who had stayed on a warship since 24 Jan
2006. In the past one and a half months, the warship was berthed at
the Penghu Island for maintenance. Hantavirus infection is rarely
reported in Taiwan. In the past 5 years, only 4 cases were reported.
On 20 Apr 2006, the index case had a sudden onset of fever and
general malaise with dizziness. The symptoms persisted for 3 days.
After he visited a local hospital for medical treatment, the fever
subsided. On 26 Apr he had an RUQ [right upper quadrant] abdominal
pain and was admitted to a military hospital in Penghu. During
hospitalization, he had leukocytosis, abnormal liver/renal function
test results (AST/ALT/Cr: 92/110/1.6), and thrombocytopenia (62 000).
Due to these signs of organ failure, he was sent to Taipei Medical
University Hospital for further evaluation and treatment. The next
day, the doctor reported him to TCDC as a suspected case of HFRS,
scrub typhus and leptospirosis. His blood samples were sent to the
national reference laboratory at TCDC for further testing. On 28 Apr,
both ELISA IgM and IgG for Hantavirus showed positive results, and
the IFA tests revealed that the subtype was Seoul [virus].
On 1 May, all of the other 85 servicemen were tested for
anti-hantavirus antibodies. Only one laboratory-confirmed case (the
patient recalled that he had fever on 15 Mar) was noted. On 2 May,
another solider had fever and was admitted to the Armed Forces Penghu
Hospital in Penghu County. The next day, he was sent back to
Tri-Service General Hospital in Taipei for further evaluation but his
laboratory test for hantavirus came back negative. His laboratory
test results remained negative for hantavirus until 8 May. All 3
cases were infected with the Seoul type virus. Currently, 2 patients
have recovered and only one remains hospitalized but in stable
condition.
Control measures have been implemented by Penghu County's Department
[Bureau?] of Health, the Fifth Branch of TCDC, and the Navy since 30
Apr. The measures included trapping and exterminating rodents. Tests
revealed that among the 13 rodents caught on the warship and in the
naval accommodation building on the coast of Penghu County, 6 rodents
showed positive results (a positive rate of 46 percent; with 2
positive rodents from the warship and 4 from the building). All
servicemen moved out of the warship on 3 May because a new suspicious
case occurred. The servicemen received health education on the
prevention of hantavirus infection on 4 May. Three video conferences
chaired by the 2 Deputy Directors of TCDC were held on 1, 2 and 4 May
to coordinate commands and control the outbreak. The participants
included the infectious disease experts and representatives from the
Military Medical Bureau of DoD [DOD, Department of Defense?], Taipei
City DOH [Bureau of Health or BOH?], Kaohsiung City DOH [Bureau of
Health or BOH?], Penghu County DOH [Bureau of Health or BOH?], as
well as the warship captain and TCDC staff. Press releases were
issued on 1 and 5 May to update the public about this outbreak.

[Dr. Chan-Hsieh Chiu's first-hand report on the cluster of hantavirus
infections is greatly appreciated by ProMED-mail.
As described by Dr. Chiu, human cases of rodent-borne hemorrhagic
fever with renal syndrome are rather rare in Taiwan. However, the
epidemiological findings in both local rodents (species not
specified) and high-risk individuals (such as harbor workers)
strongly suggest that Taiwan is an endemic area of hantavirus
(Seoul-like type), see also: 19960408.0664.
A general description of HFRS can be accessed at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/hfrs.htm>.
The genus _Hantavirus_ belongs to the family _Bunyaviridae_ of
viruses with negative-stranded and tripartite RNA genomes. The hosts
of hantaviruses are primarily rodents, and genetically distinct
hantaviruses are usually associated with a single rodent species.
Rodent carriers of hantaviruses warrant for persistent non-pathogenic
infections. Human infection is incidental to viral survival and is
often a dead end in the infection chain. The fatality rate is between
5 - 15 percent. Unlike viruses of the other genera of the family
_Bunyaviridae_, the hantaviruses are not transmitted by arthropods.
