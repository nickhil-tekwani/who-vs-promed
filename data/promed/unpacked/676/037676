A rare disease known as Congo fever has claimed its 1st victims in India.

The Palghar district administration issued a Congo fever alert after neighboring Gujarat districts reported around 4 cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), feared to be spreading from animals to humans. The district administration has asked cattle feeders, meat sellers, and staff of the state animal husbandry department to watch out for symptoms that can cause the Congo fever. The virus is transmitted through the bite of the Hyalomma tick, an external parasite, living by feeding on the blood of mammals, birds, etc.

Jogeshwari's only Tabela owner, Ramanand Tiwary, told Afternoon Voice that "the cattle are brought from Gujarat and nearby areas to Mumbai. The sheds here are congested due to space problems; we maintain possible hygiene, but, still, avoiding cattle is not possible."

Ashish Mulk, a Veterinary doctor from Borivali said "this is not the 1st time that Maharashtra is facing the threat of Congo fever; it actually returns every year. Surprisingly, no major steps are taken to control such hazards."

"The onset of CCHF is sudden, with initial signs and symptoms including headache, high fever, back pain, joint pain, stomach pain, and vomiting. Red eyes, a flushed face, a red throat, and petechiae (red spots) on the palate are common. Symptoms may also include jaundice, and in severe cases, changes in mood and sensory perception. As the illness progresses, large areas of severe bruising, severe nosebleeds, and uncontrolled bleeding at injection sites can be seen, beginning on about the 4th day of illness and lasting for about 2 weeks."

The COVID pandemic has already taken a toll, and this is another threat to human lives.

The long-term effects of CCHF infection have not been studied well enough in survivors to determine whether or not specific complications exist. However, recovery is slow. The animal husbandry department's deputy commissioner Dr. Prashant Kamble in a circular said that CCHF has been found in some districts of Gujarat. As villages of Palghar district border Gujarat, an alert has been issued. No case of CCHF has been reported in Palghar district so far. Those with symptoms like headache, high fever, joint pains, abdomen pain and nausea, redness of the eyes, and bleeding from the nose have been asked to report to the district administration. Farmers have been asked to ensure the hygiene of cattle sheds, wearing masks, gumboots, and hand gloves.

The district is already tackling growing cases of COVID-19 in rural areas. As of Monday [28 Sep 2020], the district had 34 558 cases, of which rural Palghar had 12 279.

In January 2011, the 1st human cases of CCHF in India were reported in Sanand, Gujarat, India, with 4 reported deaths, which included the index patient, treating physician, and nurse. As of May 2012, 71 people were reported to have contracted the disease in Iran, resulting in 8 fatalities.

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a zoonotic viral disease that is asymptomatic in infected animals, but a serious threat to the health of humans. Human infections begin with non-specific febrile symptoms but progress to a serious hemorrhagic syndrome with a high case fatality rate. Although the causative virus is often transmitted by ticks, animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission also occurs. CCHF affects mostly adults and is endemic in many countries in Africa, Europe, and Asia.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has been sporadic in India. Initial clinical features of dengue fever and CCHF are similar, and it is very difficult to differentiate and diagnose CCHF. Common clinical features of CCHF include high-grade fever with chills, headache, body ache, myalgia, vomiting, abdominal pain, weakness, and bleeding from multiple sites. Laboratory investigations showed cytopenia, raised prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), raised creatinine phosphokinase (CPK), and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) as well as altered liver and renal functions. Patients with the above symptoms can rapidly progress to bleeding from multiple sites and death compared to dengue fever. It is crucial to recognize CCHF at an early stage to institute ribavirin treatment and supportive therapy. There is no human vaccine available. It is also important to prevent nosocomial spread of disease to health care workers.

During 2001, cases and/or outbreaks were recorded in Iran, Pakistan, and South Africa, with the latest being in India. It has also been found in parts of Europe, including southern portions of the former USSR, Turkey, Bulgaria, Greece, Albania, and Kosovo. - Mod.UBA
