[1] Kazakhstan: Follow-up

A Chinese embassy has issued a warning about a deadly "unknown pneumonia" circulating in Kazakhstan, but authorities outside of China say these cases are still likely COVID-19.

On Thursday ([9 Jul 2020]), officials with the embassy in Kazakhstan issued an alert to residents that the unidentified pneumonia had killed more than 1700 people in Kazakhstan, including Chinese citizens, according to CNN. "The death rate of this disease is much higher than the novel coronavirus," the alert said, according to Newsweek.

However, authorities in Kazakhstan denied such an outbreak, saying that "this information does not correspond to reality," CNN reported. A statement from Kazakhstan's health ministry said that there were "viral pneumonias of unspecified etiology" in the country. However, the statement said that the classification of "unspecified" was used for cases of COVID-19 that had been diagnosed based on symptoms but not confirmed with laboratory testing.

In a press briefing for the World Health Organization (WHO) on Friday ([10 Jul 2020]), Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Program, said that the news of this outbreak "is certainly on our radar," and that the organization is working with authorities in Kazakhstan to investigate it.

These cases are likely COVID-19, given that there has been a big surge in COVID-19 in the country recently, with more than 10 000 such cases diagnosed there in the past week, Ryan said. WHO is now looking at the quality of testing conducted and whether some of these unspecified pneumonia cases are due to false-negative test results for COVID-19, he said.

Ryan noted that clusters of atypical pneumonia can occur "anywhere in the world at any time," and can be due to a number of causes, including Legionnaires' disease (severe pneumonia caused by bacteria in the _Legionella_ genus) or influenza.

"The upward trajectory of COVID-19 cases in the country would suggest that many of these cases are in fact undiagnosed cases of COVID-19," Ryan said. But, he added "we keep an open mind."

[My thoughts exactly. We had a similar "unexplained pneumonia" with high mortality report from Kano, Nigeria in the early stages of the initial surge of COVID-19 that was investigated by the Nigeria CDC and found to be due to COVID-19 (see Undiagnosed deaths - Nigeria (KN): RFI 20200609.7446939 and Undiagnosed deaths - Nigeria (02): (KN) RFI responses, relation to COVID-19 20200612.7463389). We will continue to monitor findings, but I strongly suspect this is due to COVID-19.

Abstract
--------
COVID-19 has rapidly affected mortality worldwide (1; see source URL for complete references). There is unprecedented urgency to understand who is most at risk of severe outcomes, requiring new approaches for timely analysis of large datasets. Working on behalf of NHS England, here we created OpenSAFELY: a secure health analytics platform covering 40% of all patients in England, holding patient data within the existing data centre of a major primary care electronic health records vendor. Primary care records of 17 278 392 adults were pseudonymously linked to 10 926 COVID-19-related deaths. COVID-19-related death was associated with being male (hazard ratio [HR], 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.53-1.65); older age and deprivation (both with a strong gradient); diabetes; severe asthma; and various other medical conditions. Compared with people with white ethnicity, Black and South Asian people were at higher risk even after adjustment for other factors (HR, 1.48; 1.30-1.69 and 1.44; 1.32-1.58, respectively). We have quantified a range of clinical risk factors for COVID-19-related death in the largest cohort study conducted by any country to date. OpenSAFELY is rapidly adding further patients' records; we will update and extend results regularly.

Discussion
----------
This secure analytics platform operating across over 23 million patient records for the COVID-19 emergency was used to identify, quantify, and explore risk factors for COVID-19-related death in the largest cohort study conducted by any country to date. Most comorbidities were associated with increased risk, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, respiratory disease including severe asthma, obesity, history of haematological malignancy or recent other cancer, kidney, liver, neurological and autoimmune conditions. People from South Asian and black groups had a substantially higher risk of death, only partially attributable to comorbidity, deprivation or other risk factors. A strong association between deprivation and risk was only partly attributable to comorbidity or other risk factors.

These analyses provide a preliminary picture of how key demographic characteristics and a range of comorbidities, a priori selected as being of interest in COVID-19, are jointly associated with poor outcomes. These initial results may be used subsequently to inform the development of prognostic models. We caution against interpreting our estimates as causal effects. For example, the fully adjusted smoking hazard ratio does not capture the causal effect of smoking due to the inclusion of comorbidities which are likely to mediate any effect of smoking on COVID-19 death (e.g., COPD). Our study has highlighted a need for carefully designed causal analyses specifically focusing on the causal effect of smoking on COVID-19 death. Similarly, there is a need for analyses exploring the causal relationships underlying the associations observed between hypertension and COVID-19 death.

Discussion
----------
Using national case-based surveillance and supplementary data reported from 16 jurisdictions, characteristics of greater than 10 000 decedents with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were described. More than one-third of Hispanic decedents (34.9%) and nearly one-third (29.5%) of nonwhite decedents were aged less than 65 years, but only 13.2% of white decedents were aged less than 65 years. Consistent with reports describing the characteristics of deaths in persons with COVID-19 in the USA and China (2-5; see source URL for complete references), approximately three-fourths of decedents had one or more underlying medical conditions reported (76.4%) or were aged greater than or equal to 65 years (74.8%). Among reported underlying medical conditions, cardiovascular disease and diabetes were the most common. Diabetes prevalence among decedents aged less than 65 years (49.6%) was substantially higher than that reported in an analysis of hospitalized COVID-19 patients aged less than 65 years (35%) and persons aged less than 65 years in the general population (less than 20%) (5-7). Among decedents aged less than 65 years, 7.8% died in an emergency department or at home; these out-of-hospital deaths might reflect lack of healthcare access, delays in seeking care, or diagnostic delays. Health communications campaigns could encourage patients, particularly those with underlying medical conditions, to seek medical care earlier in their illnesses. Additionally, healthcare providers should be encouraged to consider the possibility of severe disease among younger persons who are Hispanic, nonwhite, or have underlying medical conditions. More prompt diagnoses could facilitate earlier implementation of supportive care to minimize morbidity among individuals and earlier isolation of contagious persons to protect communities from SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

The relatively high percentages of Hispanic and nonwhite decedents aged less than 65 years were notable. The median age of nonwhite persons (31 years) in the USA is lower than that of white persons (44 years); these differences might help explain the higher proportions of Hispanic and nonwhite decedents among those aged less than 65 years. The median ages among Hispanic and nonwhite decedents (71 and 72 years, respectively) were 9-10 years lower than that of white decedents (81 years). However, the percentage of Hispanic decedents aged less than 65 years (33.9%) exceeded the percentage of Hispanic persons aged less than 65 years in the US population (20%); the percentage of nonwhite COVID-19 decedents aged less than 65 years (40.2%) also exceeded the overall percentage of nonwhite decedents aged less than 65 years (23%) in the US population (8). Further study is needed to understand the reasons for these differences. It is possible that rates of SARS-CoV-2 transmission are higher among Hispanic and nonwhite persons aged less than 65 years than among white persons; one potential contributing factor is higher percentages of Hispanic and nonwhite persons engaged in occupations (e.g., service industry) or essential activities that preclude physical distancing (9). It is also possible that the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affected communities of younger, nonwhite persons during the study period (10). Although these data did not permit assessment of interactions between race/ethnicity, underlying medical conditions, and nonbiologic factors, further studies to understand and address these racial/ethnic differences are needed to inform targeted efforts to prevent COVID-19 mortality.

Despite these limitations, this report provides more detailed demographic and clinical information on a subset of approximately 10 000 decedents with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Most decedents were aged less than 65 years and had underlying medical conditions. Compared with white decedents, more Hispanic and nonwhite decedents were aged less than 65 years. Additional studies are needed to elucidate associations between age, race/ethnicity, SARS-CoV-2 infection, disease severity, underlying medical conditions (especially diabetes), socioeconomic status (e.g., poverty and access to healthcare), behavioral factors (e.g., ability to comply with mitigation recommendations and maintain essential work responsibilities), and out-of-hospital deaths. Regional and state level efforts to examine the roles of these factors in SARS-CoV-2 transmission and COVID-19-associated deaths could lead to targeted, community-level, mortality prevention initiatives. Examples include health communication campaigns targeted toward Hispanics and nonwhite persons aged less than 65 years. These campaigns could encourage social distancing and the need for wearing cloth face coverings in public settings. In addition, healthcare providers should be encouraged to consider the possibility of disease progression, particularly in Hispanic and nonwhite persons aged less than 65 years and persons of any race/ethnicity, regardless of age, with underlying medical conditions, especially diabetes.

*Underlying medical conditions include cardiovascular disease (congenital heart disease, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, cerebrovascular accident/stroke, valvular heart disease, conduction disorders or dysrhythmias, other cardiovascular disease); diabetes mellitus; chronic lung disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/emphysema, asthma, tuberculosis, other chronic lung diseases); immunosuppression (cancer, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection, identified as being immunosuppressed); chronic kidney disease (chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease, other kidney diseases); neurologic conditions (dementia, seizure disorder, other neurologic conditions); chronic liver disease (cirrhosis, alcoholic hepatitis, chronic liver disease, end-stage liver disease, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, other chronic liver diseases); obesity (body mass index of 30 kg/m2 or greater).

[These 2 studies are basically carrying the same message -- disadvantaged minority groups are at greater risk most likely due to inherent inequities in health services for less affluent society members, so they are coming into this pandemic with a higher incidence of comorbidities, working in jobs that make social distancing unobtainable, and have less access to services so many of the deaths occur at home or soon after arrival at the health service.

Initial studies early on focused on the comorbidities, but these later studies tell a more complete story than the comorbidities alone. - Mod.MPP]

[The 2 new confirmed cases in the past 24 hours were both imported, and it is now 5 days that no new cases have been reported from Beijing.

There were 4 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals and no new conversions from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. Since 18 May 2020, there have been 37 cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic infections reported by China.

Hong Kong reported 38 new cases. At the time of preparation of this report, the Centre for Health Protection in Hong Kong had not issued a press release on these cases. A media reported dated 10 Jul 2020 mentioned that 32 of the 38 new confirmed cases were locally transmitted, including 11 residents of a public housing estate, 10 who are related to 2 local restaurants and 9 whose source of infection is unknown. The other 2 are an elderly home resident and a teenage son of a patient. There was mention that primary and secondary schools will begin their summer recess on Monday (13 Jul 2020) as a shut-down measure (https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2020/07/d0e38dadcb52-new-wave-of-coronavirus-infections-in-hong-kong-hits-fast-wide.html).

Takeaway message: China continues to have importations of infected individuals with SARS-CoV-2, many of whom are detected as asymptomatic at the time of positive PCR testing. Hong Kong is dealing with increased local transmission associated with lifting of restrictions.

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 35 cases with no new deaths, compared with 45 cases and 1 new death in the previous day (9 Jul 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 88 consecutive days. There were 20 locally transmitted cases: Gwangju (9), Seoul (6), Daejeon (2), Gyeonggi (2), and Incheon (1), and 15 imported cases -- airport quarantine (8), Seoul (2), Gyeonggi (2), Jeonbuk (2), and Chungnam (1). There were 10 provinces reporting no newly confirmed cases (compared with 9 provinces yesterday, 9 Jul 2020).

According to data from the "ncov" website of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the cumulative confirmation rate has been steady at 1.0% (http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/). The English language page for notice 427 provides epidemiologic details on the 35 cases reported today (10 Jul 2020) with graphs and tables presenting the status of the pandemic in South Korea. Notices 425 and 426 detail reports from yesterday's (9 Jul 2020) reports of 45 newly confirmed cases, including updates on major clusters in the country (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030).

The overall impression hasn't changed: Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. However, that being said, importations are also playing a major role in the country as well.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is up by +276 cases and +12 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (9 Jul 2020) 24-hour change was +229 cases and +12 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are still in a slow decline. Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak (see tables at the link on the source URL to "download the latest data"). Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (135); Emilia-Romagna (53), Lazio (23), Liguria (15), Veneto (11), and Piedmont (10) are the provinces reporting 10 or more cases. A total of 15 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (4 provinces reported no new cases). Italy is now 65 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 49 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up. There are subtle signs that cases are starting to increase but time will tell. For more detailed information on the outbreak, I suggest going to the source URL above.

At the bottom of the tables, there was a comment that the Lazio Region reported an additional 12 positive molecular tests on people investigated for SARS-CoV-2 infection on screening of the flight from Dhaka (Bangladesh) to Rome on 6 Jun 2020. The total number of positive people from the flight in question is now 48. As with other countries with marked reductions of cases, importations are taking a more prominent role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission in this country.

Iran's Health Ministry spokeswoman says 215 015 coronavirus patients have recovered from the disease so far and been discharged from the hospital. In a press briefing on Friday [10 Jul 2020], Sima-Sadat Lari said 142 people have also died of the virus in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of fatalities to 12 447. She confirmed 2262 new cases of infection with the novel coronavirus, raising the total number of cases to 252 720.

A total of 3319 patients are also in severe conditions of the disease, she added. Lari noted that 1 922 501 COVID-19 tests have been taken across the country.

According to Lari, East Azarbaijan, West Azarbaijan, Kermanshah, Khuzestan, Hormozgan, Bushehr, Kurdistan, Khorasan Razavi, and Ilam provinces are still considered as red zones as in previous days. Tehran, Isfahan, Mazandaran, Golestan, Alborz, Kerman, Yazd, Sistan and Baluchestan, Hamadan, and Ardabil provinces are also in dangerous conditions, she added, urging people to seriously avoid any unnecessary travel, especially to Khorasan Razavi and Mazandaran provinces.

[As of 10 Jul 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 252 720, including 12 447 deaths, an increase of 2262 cases and 142 deaths since 9 Jul 2020. The numbers of daily reported cases and deaths are slowing increasing. There are now 9 provinces classified as "red zones" and an additional 10 provinces considered in dangerous condition. Another media report mentioned that most new cases are related to large gatherings such as weddings and funerals (https://en.radiofarda.com/a/iran-to-postpone-nationwide-university-entrance-exams-due-to-surge-in-covid/30719515.html).

Takeaway message remains the same: Premature lifting of restrictions is taking its toll in Iran as is elsewhere in the world. Unfortunately, many people think that lifting of restrictions means the virus has gone away and measures like mask wearing and social distancing are no longer necessary, leading to resurgences of increased transmission and the resultant increase in severe cases and deaths, as well as the need to reimplement some forms of lockdown to flatten the curves again so the health systems aren't overwhelmed.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA as per Worldometer data for the top 20 reporting entities. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 3 291 786 including 136 671 deaths, an increase from 3 219 999 cases and 135 822 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 215 265 cases as of 13:00 EDT (GMT-4) on 10 Jul 2020 (+313 since 9 Jul 2020) including 18 653 (+16 since 9 Jul 2020) confirmed deaths and an additional 4614 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are Florida, Texas, California, Georgia, Arizona, Louisiana, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, and [US Military] Ohio. This list includes states that are showing major increases in daily cases reported beginning with the lifting of restrictions around the end of May 2020. All of the top 10 states reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, with the range being 1553 to 11 433. Of note is that Idaho (in 21st position) reported 500 cases in the past 24 hours -- a sign of increasing transmission. In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by California, Texas, Florida, New Jersey, Illinois, Arizona, Georgia (surpassed Massachusetts in the past 24 hours), Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania. A total of 42 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

In the past 24 hours, the proportion of newly confirmed cases was 2.2%. The 7-day average of newly confirmed cases for the past 7 days is 18.8% higher than the 7-day average for the preceding 7 days, consistent with the ongoing pandemic in the country.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) has data on cases, hospitalization, testing, and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance, and emergency room visits, which are definitely worth reviewing, as a welcome series of analyses. According to the CDC data, the percentage of laboratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a molecular assay remains at 9% out of 40 787 857 tests performed, consistent with the ongoing, as yet not under control pandemic in the country (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html).

[4] WHO situation report 172 (as of 10 Jul 2020)
Date: Fri 10 Jul 2020

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 10 Jul 2020.

Highlights
----------
- WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros acknowledged how civil society has played a critical role in responding to this pandemic by highlighting the needs of the most vulnerable, fighting for an equitable response, and holding decision-makers to account, in his address to a webinar on "civil society engagement in COVID-19 response at national and local levels," organised by WHO's Health Partnerships department.

- The burden of COVID-19 is overwhelming fragile health systems in Africa, although the accelerating trend of increasing cases is not uniformly distributed across the region. WHO Regional Director for Africa, Dr. Matshidiso Moeti emphasized that "if countries continue to strengthen key public health measures such as testing, tracing contacts and isolating cases, we can slow down the spread of the virus to a manageable level."

- WHO Regional Director for Europe, Dr. Hans Henri P. Kluge urged countries to stand firm and stay focused on what we know works to hold the virus at bay; step in swiftly at the 1st sign of local surges; and sign up to be part of a new culture of health during the summer months. Today we include 2 reports in the "Subject in Focus." The 1st summarizes key points on the updated scientific brief on what we currently know about the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The 2nd provides an overview of a virtual meeting that was held to share experiences and lessons learnt in COVID-19 preparedness and response at points of entry in Central Africa.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
- The Americas region reported 60.9% of the global newly reported cases and 67.6% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period, maintaining its dominance of the most severely affected region. The USA reported 46.6% of the newly confirmed cases in the region (64 630), and Brazil reported 32.1% (44 571), Mexico 5.0% (6995), Colombia 3.0% (4144), Peru 2.6% (3633), Argentina 2.6% (3604), and Chile 2.3% (3133).
- The European region reported 8.8% of the global newly reported cases and 8.8% of the newly confirmed deaths globally. Russia reported 32.9% (6635) of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by Kazakhstan 8.5% (1726), Israel 6.7% (1360), Turkey 5.1% (1024), Ukraine 4.1% (819), the UK 3.2% (642), Romania 3.0% (614), Armenia 2.8% (557), Azerbaijan 2.7% (548), and Spain 2.7 (543).
- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 7.3% of the global newly reported cases and 10.1% of global newly reported fatalities. Saudi Arabia reported 19.0% (3183) of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Pakistan 16.4% (2748), Iraq 13.0% (2170), Iran 12.4% (2079), Oman 9.1% (1518), Egypt 5.7% (950), Kuwait 5.0% (833), Bahrain 3.6% (597), and Qatar 3.3% (557).
- The African region reported 7.6% of the global newly reported cases and 3.1% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 79.0% (13 674) of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Ghana 3.7% (641), Nigeria 2.9% (499), Algeria 2.7% (460), and Kenya 2.6% (447).
- The Western Pacific region reported 0.94% of the global newly reported cases and 0.04% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 65.1% (1395) of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 16.2% (348), Australia 8.1% (173), Singapore 5.8% (125), China 2.1% (46), and South Korea 2.1% (45).
- The South East Asia region reported 14.4% of the global newly reported cases and 10.3% of global deaths. India reported 80.5% (26 506) of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 10.2% (3360), Indonesia 8.1% (2657), and Sri Lanka 0.78% (256).

Impression (unchanged): The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis, followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean alternating on a daily basis of their order, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific representing the lowest daily caseload of all of the regions.

[*On 2 Jul 2020, the Worldometer (and the Johns Hopkins CSSE data) showed a decrease in 29 726 cases for the UK. From https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/about: "Pillar 2 data for England has had duplicate tests for the same person removed by PHE from 2 Jul 2020. This means that the cumulative total number of UK lab-confirmed cases is now around 30 000 lower than reported on 1 Jul 2020." - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ
**On 2 Jun 2020, France completed a review of all positive lab tests reported and removed all duplicate tests on individuals who were counted more than once. This led to a decrease in cumulative case counts.

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 12 625 155, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. The global case count rose by 1.9% in the past 24 hours. The USA and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts. Sobering is if one tallies the total cumulative case counts for the top 5 countries (USA, Brazil, India, Russia, and Peru), they represent over half of the total cases reported globally (55.1%). A global total of 562 769 deaths have been reported, an increase of 5374 deaths in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by Brazil, India, South Africa, Mexico, Colombia, Russia, Argentina, Peru, and Saudi Arabia. All these countries are currently experiencing major community-based transmission and considered global hot spots. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases goes from 3159 to 71 787. The number of daily newly confirmed cases is climbing rapidly in the USA. The Philippines (from the Western Pacific Region) dropped down to the 21st position in terms of daily reported cases. This listing very much reflects the "hot spots" in terms of countries and regions with ongoing high transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts. - Mod.MPP]
