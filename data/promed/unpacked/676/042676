Re: Congenital malformations, ovine - Israel: Shuni virus susp, RFI
-------------------------------------------
In response to ProMED-mail's RFI in the above post:

Dead malformed lambs and blood from affected ewes were submitted to Kimron Veterinary Institute [KVI] since 1 Dec 2014. Necropsies were performed by the pathology division, and samples were distributed for bacteriological, parasitological and virological tests.

Conventional RT-PCR was performed on residual brain tissue using Simbu serogroup primers to the L segment of the viral genome, primers published by Melina Fischer et al. [Ref].

A band corresponding to the Simbu serogroup was obtained from 2 of 4 brain samples.

Sequencing and BLAST analysis of this product showed 93 percent similarity to Shuni virus, 87 percent to Aino virus, 81 percent to Peaton virus, 80 percent to Sango virus, and 79 percent to Schmallenberg virus. [BLAST is an acronym for Basic Local Alignment Search Tool, an algorithm for comparing primary biological sequence information, such as the nucleotides of DNA sequences.]

These are preliminary results that indicate the presence of a Simbu serogroup virus in the brain tissue of malformed lambs. They are insufficient to establish the exact identity of the virus.

[We are very grateful for the above timely clarification, obtained from the virology division in the Kimron Veterinary Institute, Israel's national veterinary diagnostic and research facility, established in 1957 at Beit-Dagan.

It remains to be seen whether the (Simbu serogroup) orthobunyavirus detected in 2 samples of arthrogryposis-hydranecephally (AH) lambs from the affected mutton-merino flock in northern Israel is the Shuni virus (SHUV), as mentioned in the previous (clinical) report, or rather another member of the Simbu serogroup. It will also be helpful to obtain results of other tests performed on the same samples by the virology, bacteriology and parasitology divisions of the KVI, to exclude other etiologies.

The Virology Division is directed by Dr. Evgeny Khinich.

We are informed that one sample tested positive for bluetongue virus (PCR). This should not be a surprise in view of sporadic BT cases reportedly observed in the affected flock every year during the bluetongue season. Have vaccinations with an attenuated BT virus been applied in the flock? Field strains of BTV are generally not known to cause AH in sheep. This, in contrast to BTV live attenuated strains, as indicated by past observations in USA, Israel and elsewhere.

Though confirmation (or otherwise) of SHUV involvement in the described event is yet to come, the incident provides an appropriate opportunity to draw subscribers' attention to an emerging pathogen which has remained, so far, under ProMED-mail's radar. Shuni virus (SHUV), an orthobunyavirus of the simbu serogroup, has been mentioned in the past only once in a ProMED-mail posting, namely in archived 20111223.3662, where reference was made to the paper of Causey et al, "Isolations of Simbu-group viruses in Ibadan, Nigeria 1964-69, including the new types Sango, Shamonda, Sabo and Shuni. Ann Trop Med Parasitol. 1972; 66(3), 357-62."

SHUV is, reportedly, an emerging equine disease in South Africa, causing encephalitis in horses and suspected to have public health implications; see the presentation by M. Venter, IMED 2014, Vienna: "Epidemiology of West Nile virus and endemic arboviruses in neurological disease in South Africa: a One Health approach," available on-line at http://imed.isid.org/downloads/IMED2014_Presentations/IMED2014_Venter.pdf (SHUV addressed from slide 12 onwards). One of the conclusions was: "Sero-prevalence in high-risk individuals (veterinarians) was 7 percent for WNV and 3.5 for Shuni virus." This may be of interest from a One Health point of view. - Mod.AS
