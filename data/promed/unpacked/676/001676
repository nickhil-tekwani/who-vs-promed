[With the continuing decline in the number of cases in the human population
of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- abbreviated previously as vCJD or
CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail -- it has been decided to broaden the scope
of the occasional ProMED-mail updates to include other prion-related
diseases. Data on vCJD cases and other forms of CJD: sporadic, iatrogenic,
familial, and GSS (Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease) are included
also when they have some relevance to the incidence and etiology of vCJD. -

The number of suspect cases of vCJD referred to the CJD surveillance unit
in Edinburgh and the number of deaths of definite and probable variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or
vCJD], the form of the disease thought to be linked to BSE (bovine
spongiform encephalopathy), remain unchanged since the previous monthly
report; that is, the number of definite or probable vCJD cases (dead and
alive) remains 167.

This situation is consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in the UK
is in decline. The 1st cases were observed in 1995, and the peak number of
deaths was 28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in
2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in 2007, and only one so far (up
to the end of October) in 2008.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the year 2008
--------------------------------------------------
As of 3 Nov 2008 in the UK, so far there have been 114 referrals, 62 deaths
from sporadic CJD, 4 deaths from iatrogenic CJD, 3 from GSS, 2 from
familial CJD, and one from vCJD.

During the period 1992 to 2008, there were 23 cases of vCJD, all now
deceased. They occurred between 1996 and 2007: one case in 1996, one in
2000, one in 2001, 3 in 2002, none in 2003, 2 in 2004, 6 in 2005, 6 in
2006, 3 in 2007, and none so far in 2008. There were 12 male and 11 female
patients.

Their ages at time of death ranged from 19 to 58 years (mean 39); 6 of the
patients resided in the Ile-de-France [Paris area] and 17 in the provinces.
All the cases were met-met homozygotes for codon 129 of the prion protein
gene. No special risk factors were evident, which distinguished these
patients from those with other forms of CJD (sporadic, genetic,
iatrogenic). However, one patient had visited the UK at regular intervals.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the year 2008
--------------------------------------------------
As of 30 Oct 2008 in France, so far in 2008 there have been 1230 referrals,
56 deaths from sporadic CJD, 3 deaths from iatrogenic CJD, 7 from familial
CJD, none from GSS, and none from vCJD.

Cases examined - as of September 2008
---------------------------------------
During the period 1997 to 2008, 2 cases of vCJD were reported, both
contracted overseas. The 1st case was recorded in 2004 (disease contracted
in the UK), and the 2nd in 2006 (disease contracted in Saudi Arabia).

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the year 2008
--------------------------------------------------
So far in 2008, there have been 273 referrals, 124 cases of prion disease,
including 109 cases of sporadic CJD, 15 cases of familial CJD, no cases of
iatrogenic CJD, and no indigenous cases of vCJD.

Overall during the period 1997 to 2008, there have been 2962 referrals,
1663 cases of prion disease, 1413 cases of sporadic CJD, 244 cases of
familial CJD, 4 cases of iatrogenic CJD, and no indigenous cases of vCJD.

[During 2008 so far, the USA, with about 2.5 times the combined populations
of the UK and France, has reported fewer cases of sporadic CJD (109 versus
117). Whether this is due to a difference in surveillance procedure or
actual disease incidence is unclear at present. - Mod.CP]

[4] The Spanish cluster of vCJD

Statement on a variant CJD family cluster
-----------------------------------------
Three cases of pathologically confirmed variant CJD have been identified in
Spain in recent years, including a man in his early 40s who died earlier
this year [2008]. The clinical illness in this individual was typical of
variant CJD, including the appearances on the MRI brain scan.

A few months ago, his mother, who was in her 60s, developed a rapidly
progressive neurological illness and died about 5 months from the onset of
this illness. An MRI brain scan showed appearances suggestive of variant
CJD, and preliminary results from post-mortem examination suggest that the
suspected diagnosis of variant CJD is correct. Further results, which may
confirm this diagnosis, should be available within a few days.

Since 1994, there have been 167 cases of variant CJD in the UK, 23 cases in
France and 15 cases in other countries, excluding Spain. The occurrence of
variant CJD in more than one member of the same family has not been seen
before, and it has been the general view that family members of variant CJD
cases are not themselves at greater risk of developing this condition. This
raises the question as to why 2 cases of variant CJD have now been found in
a family in Spain.

There is no evidence of a genetic form of CJD in these Spanish cases, and
preliminary investigation has not shown any risk of CJD through medical or
surgical treatment. There is no evidence of any risk of transmission of CJD
through direct personal contact. The mother and son lived in an area of
Spain in which BSE has been found, and it is possible that direct
consumption of material with high levels of BSE infection may have been the
source of the infection. In the UK and other countries, it is believed that
processed bovine tissues were the most likely source of BSE infection, and
it is possible that different forms of exposure to BSE infection may
explain the occurrence of variant CJD in 2 family members in Spain and not
elsewhere.

This, however, is uncertain, and public health policies in relation to
variant CJD may have to be reviewed in the light of these 2 cases in Spain.

Current issues
--------------
Regarding a mother and son in Spain who had died of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD): this is the 1st recorded instance of more
than one case of vCJD within one family. Both the mother and son lived in a
region of Spain with a history of BSE and had frequently shared meals of
cattle brain. As no other risk factor has been identified, it seems most
likely that both infections were acquired from dietary exposure.

Surveillance for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in China from 2006 to 2007
---------------------------------------------------
[The following is the provisional abstract of a paper with the above title,
by Qi Shi, Chen Gao, Wei Zhou, Baoyun Zhang, Jianming Chen, Chan Tian, et
al; published in BMC Public Health 2008; 8: 360]

Background
----------
Human transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (HTSE), or
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), is a group of rare and fatal diseases in
the central nervous system. Since outbreak of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) and variant CJD, a worldwide CJD surveillance network
has been established under the proposition of WHO. In China, a national CJD
surveillance system has started since 2002. The data of CJD surveillance
from 2006 to 2007 was analyzed.

Methods
-------
A total of 12 provinces are included in the CJD surveillance system. The
surveillance unit in each province consists of one or 2 sentinel hospitals
and the provincial CDC. All suspected CJD cases reported from CJD
surveillance were diagnosed and subtyped based on the diagnostic criteria
for CJD issued by WHO.

Results
-------
A total of 192 suspected CJD cases were reported and 5 genetic CJD, 51
probable and 30 possible sporadic CJD (sCJD) cases were diagnosed. The
collected sCJD cases distribute sporadically without geographical
clustering and seasonal relativity, and the highest incidences in both
probable and possible sCJD cases appeared in the group of 60-69 years old.

The most common 3 foremost symptoms were progressive dementia, cerebellum
and mental-related symptoms. The probable sCJD patients having both typical
EEG alteration and being CSF protein 14-3-3 positive have more
characteristic clinical syndromes than the ones having only one positive.
The polymorphisms of codon 129 of all tested reported cases show typical
patterns of Han Chinese, as in previous reports that M129M is predominant,
whereas M129V is rare.

Conclusion
----------
Chinese CJD patients possessed similar epidemiological and clinical
characteristics as the population worldwide.

[7] CJD in dura mater grafts - Japan, 1978-2008

Update: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease associated with cadaveric dura mater
grafts, Japan, 1978-2008
--------------------------------------
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is the most common of the human prion
diseases (also known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies), which,
according to the leading hypothesis, are caused by an abnormal protein
(that is, prion) that is able to induce abnormal folding of normal cellular
prion proteins. Annual worldwide incidence of these always fatal
neurodegenerative diseases is estimated at 0.5-2.0 cases per million
population. CJD can occur sporadically, or as a genetic disease, or can be
transmitted iatrogenically. In 1996, a new human prion disease, variant CJD
(vCJD), was 1st described in the United Kingdom. This disease was believed
to have resulted from human consumption of cattle products contaminated
with the prions responsible for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE,
commonly known as mad cow disease). That year, in part to check for
possible vCJD cases, a national survey was conducted in Japan; 821 CJD
cases were identified, including 43 cases associated with receipt of
cadaveric dura mater grafts (1). A single brand of dural graft (Lyodura)
produced by a German manufacturer before May 1987 was identified as the
most likely vehicle of transmission in all but one case (2,3). By 2003,
continued surveillance in Japan had identified a total of 97 such cases
(2). Since then, an additional 35 cases have been identified. This report
updates previous reports and summarizes the investigation of all 132 cases
to date linked to dural grafts. The results suggest that, because of the
long incubation period between graft receipt and symptom onset (possibly
greater than 24.8 years), continued surveillance in Japan might identify
additional CJD cases associated with dural grafts. Since 1996 in Japan, a
nongovernmental CJD surveillance group supported by the Ministry of Health
and Welfare (later renamed the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare) has
conducted a national survey seeking cases of human prion disease. The
survey is mailed to neurologic, psychiatric, and neuropathologic
departments of hospitals with a minimum bed capacity of 100 (overall
response rate: 74 per cent) (1,2). A case of CJD associated with a dura
mater graft is defined as physician-diagnosed CJD in the recipient of a
cadaveric dura mater graft whose disease was reviewed and accepted as CJD
by the surveillance system's panel of neurologists.

During 1996-2008, as clinicians reported additional CJD cases to the
surveillance system sponsored by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the
number of persons identified with CJD associated with cadaveric dura mater
grafts increased from 43 initially to 132. All 132 patients had received
dura mater grafts during 1978-1993. Three patients received more than one
dural graft during this period, including one patient reported previously.
For purposes of analysis, the 1st graft was assumed to be the source of
infection in all 3 patients. Of the 132 patients, the most common medical
conditions leading to the use of dural grafts were tumor (60 patients, 45
per cent), brain hemorrhage (21, 16 per cent), Jannetta procedure for
facial palsy (18, 14 per cent) and for trigeminal neuralgia (7, 5 per
cent), and intracranial aneurysm (9, 7 per cent). The other conditions were
unspecified anomalies (6 patients), hematoma (6), injury (4), and
ossification of the spinal posterior longitudinal ligament (one).

Illness onset for the 132 CJD patients ranged from September 1985 to
October 2006. The mean age of the 132 patients at onset was 55 years
(range: 15-80 years); the median age was 57 years. A total of 79 (60 per
cent) patients were female. Neuropathologic confirmation of CJD diagnosis
was obtained from 31 (23 per cent) patients; 81 (80 per cent) of the other
101 patients with physician-diagnosed CJD had an electroencephalogram with
a periodic synchronous discharge pattern characteristic of CJD.

Incubation periods ranged from 1.2 years (receipt in 1987 and onset in
1989) to 24.8 years (receipt in 1981 and onset in 2006). The median and
mean incubation periods were 12.4 years and 11.8 years, respectively.

A total of 120 of the 132 patients (91 per cent) were documented to have
received Lyodura dural grafts; investigators were unable to identify the
lot numbers of the grafts used. For the 12 other patients, the brand name
of the dural graft was unknown. A total of 109 (83 per cent) patients
received their dural grafts during 1983-1987, when an estimated 100 000
persons received Lyodura grafts in Japan (2,4).

MMWR editorial note:
--------------------
New cases of CJD associated with dural grafts continue to be reported in
Japan, and Lyodura grafts remain the most likely vehicle for transmission.
Similar to other allogeneic dura mater grafts, Lyodura grafts were derived
from cadaveric dura mater and used by surgeons for soft-tissue
reconstruction of damaged, missing, or impaired tissues (primarily dura
mater). According to the manufacturer, the grafts were gradually absorbed
in situ, colonized by fibroblasts and stem cells, and eventually replaced
by endogenous connective tissue.

In 1987, the 1st identified case of CJD associated with a Lyodura graft was
reported in the United States (5). During the US investigation of that
case, the manufacturer reported revising collection and processing
procedures for Lyodura to reduce the risk for CJD transmission (6). Only 6
of the 132 patients in Japan received their dural grafts after 1987, and
only one of these 6 patients is known to have received a Lyodura graft that
was most likely produced after 1987. This patient had received 2 dura mater
grafts in 1991 at a hospital that reported using only Lyodura or another
brand of dural grafts, Tutoplast (3). No cases have been reported in Japan
among patients who received their 1st dural graft after 1993.

The substantial number of CJD cases associated with dural grafts in Japan
likely reflects the widespread use in that country of Lyodura grafts
produced before May 1987. During 1983-1987, an estimated 20 000 persons in
Japan received Lyodura grafts each year, about 50 times higher than the
estimated number of recipients in the US (2,4). Although Lyodura was then
available to US hospitals through the mail, the German manufacturer
produced Lyodura for distribution in Japan and other countries but not for
distribution in the US (7). In June 1987, after the company learned of the
1st CJD case associated with a Lyodura graft, the manufacturer reported
revising procedures for the collection and processing of its dura mater
grafts after 1 May 1987, to reduce the risk for CJD transmission (6). The
key reported processing changes included conversion from batch to
individual processing of dura mater and treatment of each dura mater graft
with 1.0 normal sodium hydroxide (NaOH); no practical final screening test
of the product for prion contamination is available. However, the change to
individual processing of dura mater greatly limited the number of grafts
that could be contaminated by a single infected donor. In addition, 1.0
normal NaOH is known to be highly effective for inactivating prions (3).

In the US, after report of the 1st Lyodura-associated CJD case, the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a recall in late April 1987 of Lyodura
that was packaged in 1982, the year the graft used in the initial US case
had been packaged. In addition, after receiving report of a 2nd
Lyodura-associated CJD case in a patient in New Zealand, CDC advised
avoiding Lyodura grafts produced before May 1987 (6). However, no
international recall of Lyodura produced before May 1987 occurred.
Therefore, the implicated Lyodura with its potential contaminant might have
remained in use at Japanese hospitals for several years.

Cases of dural graft-associated CJD in Japan have occurred since 1985,
peaking during 1995-1999, when 51 of the 132 patients became ill. As this
outbreak has continued, the median incubation period has increased to 12.4
years, and the longest period between graft surgery and onset of illness is
now 24.8 years. In the US, 2 more patients with Lyodura-associated CJD have
been identified since the 1st reported case in 1987. Most recently, a
patient aged 26 years died in 2006 from autopsy-confirmed CJD (7). The
incubation period in this case was 18.7 years.

The long incubation period and always fatal outcome of CJD and other
transmissible spongiform encephalopathies underscore the importance of
efforts to minimize potential exposures of persons to prions. However,
implementing timely preventive measures against these diseases can be
difficult because the public health significance of certain actions might
not become apparent for years, if at all. For example, in 1987, the
producer of Lyodura revised collection and production measures without
knowing at the time that these actions likely would prevent many future
deaths from Lyodura-associated CJD. Similarly, in 1997, a feed ban was
instituted to prevent BSE in the United States, even though no endemic BSE
had been recognized in North America. In addition, to prevent potential
cases of vCJD in the United States, prospective blood donors who might have
been exposed to BSE in the United Kingdom were deferred, even before
transmission of the vCJD agent via blood transfusion had been documented in
that country (8).

In 1997, the FDA's Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory
Committee recognized that use of human dura mater carries an inherent risk
for transmitting CJD. However, the committee recommended that the use of
such grafts be left to the discretion of the treating neurosurgeon,
provided that the human dura mater is procured and processed according to
additional safety measures outlined by the committee (9). After the
committee's recommendations were issued, the number of dural grafts
distributed for use in the US declined from an estimated 4500 in 1997 to an
estimated 900 in 2002, to a documented 389 in 2006, and 368 in 2007 (2) (BE
Buck, MD, Miami Tissue Bank, personal communication, August 2008).

CDC continues to conduct surveillance for cases of CJD in the US through
various mechanisms, including 1) receipt and investigation, in
collaboration with local and state health departments, of case reports from
physicians and patient support groups; 2) analysis of national multiple
cause-of-death data; and 3) review of prion disease cases confirmed by the
National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center (NPDPSC) at Case
Western Reserve University (Cleveland, Ohio). During 1996-1997, CDC
established NPDPSC in collaboration with the American Association of
Neuropathologists to help maintain and enhance US human prion disease
surveillance. NPDPSC provides, free of charge, advanced neuropathologic and
biochemical prion disease diagnostic services to US physicians and other
appropriate health personnel, including local and state health officials.
Patients with a rapidly progressive dementia consistent with CJD and a
history of dural graft implantation should be reported through local or
state health departments to CDC, telephone 404-639-3091.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease from blood products, updated October 2008 [edited]

Assessing the potential risk of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease from
blood products
---------------------------------------------
A rare but fatal brain infection called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
(vCJD) has emerged in recent years as a potential threat to recipients of
plasma-derived clotting factors and other plasma-derived products, such as
immune globulin and albumin. CBER developed a computer-assisted model for
estimating this risk to recipients of plasma-derived clotting factors in
order to ensure that both patients and physicians understand this issue.
This model was developed to assess the risk of US-licensed, plasma-derived
Factor VIII products and a plasma-derived Factor XI manufactured in the
United Kingdom and used under IND in a small number of patients in the US
between 1989 and 2000. The results of the risk assessments and
communication strategies were presented to FDA's Transmissible Spongiform
Encephalopathies (TSE) Advisory Committee in September and December 2006.

Based on the risk assessments, the Public Health Service (PHS) believes the
risk of vCJD to patients who receive US-licensed, plasma-derived Factor
VIII products is extremely small, although PHS does not know the risk with
certainty. vCJD risk from other US-licensed, plasma-derived products,
including Factor IX, is likely to be as small or smaller. In addition, the
PHS believes the potential risk of vCJD infection from plasma-derived
Factor XI, although not known for certain, is likely to be small.

Furthermore, CBER developed and implemented a risk communication plan in
order to ensure the findings of the risk assessments reached the
appropriate stakeholders. CBER partnered with patient advocates and risk
communication experts to develop educational materials and arranged for
hemophilia treatment centers and professional and advocacy organizations to
publicize the findings through newsletters and other media. Finally, CBER
launched a web page <http://www.fda.gov/cber/blood/vcjdrisk.htm> that
provides the risk assessments and risk communication materials. Additional
links are provided to FDA's current guidance documents on deferral of blood
and plasma donors who may be at increased risk of vCJD and to other sources
of information on vCJD.
