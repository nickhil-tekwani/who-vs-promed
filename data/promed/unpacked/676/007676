A 35-year-old man from Amod village near Bharuch [Gujarat], who was diagnosed with the rare Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), commonly known as Congo fever, has recovered and been discharged from a city-based hospital

The patient was admitted to the Bankers Heart Institute (BHI) on [7 Sep 2016] after he complained of high fever and vomiting blood. His blood pressure had also dropped dangerously and he was extremely dehydrated.

Initially, doctors suspected dengue but his blood tests were negative.

"Dr Punit Ghetia and Dr Anuj Garg saw the possibility of the extremely rare fever 'Crimean Congo' so the patient's blood samples were sent to Pune's National Institute of Virology, which confirmed Congo fever, BHI said in a statement on [Mon 26 Sep 2016].

Bharuch district health officers were informed about the case and they immediately visited the hospital [8 Sep 2016]. "The patient's details, treatment, and precautions were provided to help identify other such cases in the district and correct course of treatment. The patient has recovered fully and given discharge too," the authorities said.

"Congo fever is extremely rare and only 7 cases have been recorded so far in the state [Gujarat]. This disease can be found amongst people who stay with cattle and near wild animals. The virus enters the human blood stream through a tick bite from a tick commonly found on cattle," BHI officials said.

Congo fever exhibits common flu symptoms for a few days, [followed by more serious symptoms including vomiting blood, low blood pressure, bleeding from mouth and in stool, and liver failure.]

[The 1st cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) were reported in Gujarat state of India in January 2011, resulting in 3 deaths in confirmed and suspected cases of CCHF, which included 2 health care workers (http://www.searo.who.int/entity/emerging_diseases/topics/cchf/en/).

It is important to understand the epidemiological link, that possible exposure sources be investigated properly, and that preventive measures be devised to check the animal to human or human to human transmission. - Mod.UBA
