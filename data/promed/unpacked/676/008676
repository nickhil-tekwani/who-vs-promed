The 7th outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) has been confirmed in
500 cattle and 1500 sheep on farm in Highampton, North Devon. The
premises have been exporting livestock to Europe (prior to the ban last
week) particularly France.
The company owns 12 other farms in Cornwall and Devon and also has
contacts in the North of England. There is no known link to other
confirmed outbreaks.
The first sign was a mouth ulcer in a cow, but 50 other cattle are now
showing early symptoms. FMD is difficult to diagnose in sheep.

Vaccination is a complex subject and there are pros and cons, but almost
everything you could possibly want to know about the "Strategy for
Emergency Vaccination against FMD" is in the EU Scientific Committee
document:
<http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/sc/scah/out22_en.html>
The EU sees this generally as supporting slaughtering, not a substitute,
and there are trade issues too, particularly if international authorities
have not been keeping up to date with modern methods which help
distinguish between vaccinated and infected animals. The UK holds stocks
of EU vaccine and MAFF says on their website they will do the vaccination
free of charge if it is decided to be beneficial. The EU report says
"farmers whose herds/flocks are vaccinated and who suffer losses as a
result of the restrictions placed on them should be fully compensated"

Farmers are to be forced by the Government to take out insurance to cover
the costs of future outbreaks of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) and other
animal diseases. A report to be published next month by the Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) will conclude the livestock industry
- not the taxpayer - must shoulder the burden for compensating farmers for
loss of business. It will say compulsory insurance or a statutory levy
funded by farmers is the only way to secure the farming industry's
long-term future.
In the past, the Government has been forced to give emergency grants
totalling 4 billion BPS to farmers suffering from the effects of the BSE
crisis, in addition to the original compensation for slaughtered cattle.
An insurance scheme would cushion the industry and save the Treasury from
having to fund emergency grants.
News of the compulsory insurance move, which would add to the financial
woes of many of Britain's 157 000 livestock farms, came as the mass
slaughter of animals with FMD began yesterday. While ministers intend to
continue to compensate farmers for the compulsory slaughter of herds
infected by diseases such as FMD and classical swine fever (CSF), all
other financial losses will have to be borne by the compulsory insurance
scheme.
Farmers would need to contribute an average of about 500 BPS a year to the
scheme, which is designed to cover loss of business due to bans on the
movement of animals and the costs of rebuilding their businesses.
Farmers' organizations reacted angrily yesterday.
A spokesman for the National Farmers Union said: "Farmers can't take any
more financial burden. It won't be popular with our members. We will have
to sit down and discuss this fully with the Government how the damaging
impact on our members could be limited."
A spokesman for the National Sheep Association said: "Any cost burden on
top of the problems we are already facing would not be welcome. We would
be wary of MAFF saddling us with the costs of things like this, which are
a livestock farmer's nightmare and no one's fault."
The compulsory scheme will not be introduced in time to help tens of
thousands of farmers who will lose business because of the ban on the
movement of animals. Only those whose herds are ordered to be slaughtered
will be compensated. Farmers can already take out insurance against
loss of business through the unexpected outbreak of disease, but barely
10 percent do so.
The details of the compulsory insurance scheme will be contained in a
report from the Government's Working Party to Review the Commercial
Impact of Animal Disease. The group, which is chaired by a senior MAFF
official and includes farming industry representatives, was set up last
summer following the first outbreak of CSF in Britain for 14 years.
Huge bonfires were constructed yesterday for the incineration of the
thousands of pigs, cattle, sheep and goats that will be slaughtered over
the next few days on the 6 farms where the FMD outbreak has been
identified.
Nick Brown, the Agriculture Minister, announced yesterday animals on an
additional 2 farms, although not contaminated, would be destroyed as a
precautionary measure because they were close to infected sites. He also
said the 7-day ban on the movement of animals could be extended if the
disease was not eradicated swiftly.
Mr Brown said: "There are very wide powers available to deal with
emergencies, both disease control measures and public order measures. But
the powers we intend to use at the moment are only those we announced
today. Nothing else is being contemplated at the moment."
Ministers have been advised that they have legal powers to ban next
month's countryside march if necessary but do not intend to use them
except as a last resort if the crisis escalates badly. There was some
panic buying of meat in shops although the big supermarket chains did not
report any significant increase in business.

[If animals have been shipped to the continent, especially France, before
the ban, then it is possible the shipped animals were already incubating
the disease. The disease may be incubating in France. We do not know if
the shipped animals had any contact with the index cases or others.
Although, there is an equal chance the animals had not been exposed.
However, if I were an animal owner in France, I would be wanting to
vaccinate my animals. - Mod.TG
