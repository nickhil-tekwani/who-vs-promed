Interspecies transmission of the canine influenza H3N2 virus to
domestic cats in South Korea, 2010
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
In the last 4 years, incidences of endemic or epidemic respiratory
diseases associated with canine influenza H3N2 virus in Asian dogs
have been reported in countries such as South Korea and China. Canine
species were considered to be the new natural hosts for this virus.
However, at the beginning of 2010, influenza-like respiratory signs,
such as dyspnea, were also observed among cats as well as in dogs in
an animal shelter located at Seoul, South Korea. The affected cats
showed 100 percent morbidity and 40 percent mortality.

We were able to isolate a virus from the lung specimen of a dead cat
that had suffered from the respiratory disease, in embryonated chicken
eggs. The 8 viral genes isolated were almost identical to those of the
canine influenza H3N2 virus suggesting interspecies transmission of
canine influenza H3N2 virus to the cat. Moreover, 3 domestic cats
infected with intranasal canine/Korea/GCVP01/07 (H3N2) all showed
elevated rectal temperatures, nasal virus shedding, and severe
pulmonary lesions, such as suppurative bronchopneumonia. Our study for
the 1st time shows that cats are susceptible to canine influenza H3N2
infection, suggesting that cats may play an intermediate host role in
transmitting the H3N2 virus among feline and canine species, which
could lead to the endemic establishment of the virus in companion
animals.

Such a scenario raises a public health concern, as the possibility of
the emergence of new recombinant feline or canine influenza viruses in
companion animals with the potential to act as zoonotic infection
cannot be excluded.

[Canine infections with influenza A viruses are currently known to be
caused by the serotypes H3N8 (USA, 2004), H3N2 (South Korea, 2007),
HPAI H5N1 (Southeast Asia, 2006), and H1N1 (New York State, 2009). The
spread of H3N2 from dogs to cats is a new development.

Regarding possible zoonotic implications of the issue, subscribers
are referred to the comprehensive reference document titled "Avian
Influenza (Bird Flu): Implications for Human Disease," updated to 16
Jun 2011, available at the CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease
Research and Policy, University of Minnesota) website via the general
link:
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/avianflu/biofacts/avflu_human.html#_Agent

(see also 20070519.1602).

The said document includes the following points which may be of
relevance to the point under discussion:

1. The pandemic H3N2 strain of 1968-69 involved reassortment events
between avian and human influenza strains.
2. Human H3N2 influenza viruses are endemic in pigs in China.
3. Seasonal influenza vaccine, which includes protection against H1N1
and H3N2, may boost cross-subtype immunity against H5N1 influenza A
viruses. This hypothesis is based on evidence suggesting that the N1
antigen may be a target for both cellular and humoral cross-type
immunity.

Recently, an investigation in Ontario, Canada, established that the
coinfection of a child with pandemic H1N1 and seasonal H3N2 influenza
viruses was accompanied by genome reassortment in the patient (_in
vivo_ reassortment); the infected child recovered and the recombinant
(reassortant) virus was not transmitted; see 20110609.1749.

The importance of the "One Health" approach and the clear need for
continuous alertness by physicians and veterinarians alike, with
interchange of information, is once more underlined. Information of
possible similar findings in other countries/species will be welcomed.
