Avian Influenza in Mongolia - Preliminary Report from Joint Wildlife
Conservation Society - Mongolia Government Expedition
A joint Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) - Mongolian Government team is
completing a survey for avian influenza at migratory bird congregation sites
in Western Mongolia. The team visited 10 sites, including Erkhel Lake in
Kovsgol province, where the Mongolian Ministry of Food and Agriculture
determined on preliminary testing that there was an outbreak of avian
influenza type A.ï¿½
Many of the birds that migrate to Qinghai Lake Nature Preserve in China (the
site of an H5N1 outbreak in wild birds this spring) also migrate to Mongolia,
thus providing a unique opportunity to collect samples from migratory birds
for testing for avian influenza.
As noted in the official report to the OIE from the Mongolian government, at
least 80 birds died at Erkhel Lake. At the lake the WCS/Mongolia team counted
over 6500 apparently healthy birds of 55 different species.
Over the course of the survey, the team collected samples from 774 individual
birds from the 10 sites. The majority of samples were faecal samples but also
included tissues from 4 birds found dead at the site. Samples came from the
following species: Bar-headed goose (_Anser indicus_), Herring Gull (_Larus
argentatus_), Black-headed gull (_Larus ridibundus_), Eurasian Widgeon (_Anas
penelope_), Ruddy Shelduck (_Tadorna ferruginea_), and Whooper Swans (_Cygnus
cygnus_).
The team is currently returning to the capital city of Ulaanbaatar. The
samples will be sent to the United States Department of Agriculture Southeast
Poultry Research Laboratory for confirmation of the viral subtype.
The survey team included WCS veterinarians and representatives of the
Mongolian National Academy of Sciences, the Mongolian Institute of Veterinary
Medicine, the State Central Veterinary Laboratory, Ministry of Food and
Agriculture Veterinary Department, and the Ministry of Health Mongolian Center
of Infectious Diseases with Natural Foci. The USDA Southeast Poultry
Laboratory is a principle collaborator on the study, which was supported by
additional funding from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization
and WCS.
WCS would like to commend the Mongolian government for their actions
surrounding this issue, particularly their willingness to collaborate and
openness with the international community.

[This is useful, timely information, for which Dr Joly is gratefully
acknowledged. Results of the pending tests are expected. We are told that the
knowledge about the exact migratory routes in the far east is rather scant
compared to what is known in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and North
America. Any information, probably from Americans and Australians who have
been working there, will help.
We are pleased to join the WCS in commending the Mongolian government for
their activities regarding animal health. The Mongolian animal health
institutions -- including the State Veterinary Services -- have established a
well-deserved reputation within the international veterinary community for
their efficient surveillance and disease control system as well as for their
exemplary official animal-disease reports. - Mod.AS]
