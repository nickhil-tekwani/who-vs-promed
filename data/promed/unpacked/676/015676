Newcastle disease in Greece
---------------------------
(Date of previous outbreak of Newcastle disease in Greece reported to the
OIE: September 1986).
Information received on 8 Jan 2005 (dated 7 Jan 2005) from Dr Vasilios
Stylas, head, Animal Health Directorate, Ministry of Agriculture, Athens:
On 7 Jan 2005, confirmation of an outbreak of Newcastle disease was
notified by the Reference Laboratory for Newcastle disease of the European
Union to the Greek Veterinary Services.
The outbreak refers to one poultry farm consisting of 20 500 broiler
chickens of free-range type, which is located in Arcadia prefecture,
Peloponese region. There are no other poultry farms in the area except one
farm consisting of 3000 broilers which did not show any sign of the disease.
The Greek Veterinary Services, immediately after notification, took actions
to implement stamping-out measures, according to the provisions of the
European Council Directive 92/66/EEC.
