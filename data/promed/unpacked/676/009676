Revocation of declaration of a temporary control zone
-----------------------------------------------------
1. This declaration is made under article 16(4) of the foot and mouth
disease [FMD] (England) Order 2006 (S.I. 2006/182) ("the Order"). It is
made in respect of the declaration of a temporary control zone made at
21.15 on 9 Aug 2007 and taking effect at 21.15 on 9 Aug 2007 ("the TCZ
declaration").
2. Terms defined in the Order have the same meaning in this declaration.
3. The chief veterinary officer has advised the secretary of state that she
no longer suspects infection in the temporary control zone declared by the
TCZ declaration.
4. The secretary of state declares that from 11.30 on 11 Aug 2007 the TCZ
declaration is revoked.

[Following this encouraging announcement, there are now 2 protection zones
left, of which one (around Elstead) is just a remainder of a suspected
case, which was not confirmed. The actually infected area is restricted to
Normandy and the site of the 2 Pirbright laboratories. - Mod.AS]

Veterinary and animal health officials were increasingly optimistic last
night [10 Aug 2007] that the outbreak of foot and mouth disease [FMD] was
under control. They were so confident that it would be contained within the
original 3 km (2 mi) protection zone that they were able to advise the
prime minister that it was unlikely to spread any farther.
Gordon Brown declared Britain "open for business" after the publication of
an epidemiology report, which concluded that any further outbreaks were
most likely to occur no more than a short distance from the original
infection. Mr Brown said: "We have restricted the disease to a limited area
of this country. The risk of it spreading out of these areas is low, if not
negligible."
The national restrictions on movement of animals will remain in place until
vets can be "absolutely sure" that an extensive outbreak has been avoided.
The protection and surveillance zones around infected areas will also
remain in place.
The prime minister made his confident statement despite the decision to set
up a fresh protection zone in Wotton, near Dorking, Surrey, several miles
from the original outbreak at Normandy, near Guildford. Tests on livestock
at the farm were being carried out yesterday [10 Aug 2007] after signs of
sickness were detected, but the chances of it being foot-and-mouth disease
were considered so low that an order to cull the animals was withheld. [For
the final results of said tests, see 1].
Laurence Matthews, the farmer affected, said that he was "absolutely sure"
that the disease was not on his farm but had decided to take no chances
after he discovered flu-like symptoms among his 850 cattle.
Debby Reynolds, the chief veterinary officer, said that the chances of the
animals at Wotton being infected were low. She added that a report by the
National Emergency Epidemiology Group concluded that while the emergence of
other cases within the protection zone around Normandy were possible, the
disease was unlikely to spread outside.
The report concurred with a study by the Health and Safety Executive this
week in highlighting the research facility at Pirbright, Surrey, as the
most likely source of the infection. The site is shared by the Institute
for Animal Health, the government-funded facility that is responsible for
analysing FMD samples, and Merial, a private firm that is licensed to
produce the vaccine. Investigations were being made to pinpoint which of
them was responsible for the release of the virus.
Dr Reynolds and the prime minister appealed for continued vigilance and
thanked farmers for their response since the outbreak was detected last
week [3 Aug 2007]. Laboratory tests revealed yesterday [10 Aug 2007] that
more than 300 livestock from the 3rd farm that was suspected to be infected
were clear of the disease. Only 2 farms have been shown to contain it.
Vaccination of livestock in areas that surround the infected sites remains
an option but Dr Reynolds has so far decided that it is unnecessary. The
Government has 300 000 doses available and trained staff would dispense the
vaccine.
The Soil Association said that if the Wotton herd should prove to be
infected, vaccinations should be deployed immediately. Patrick Holden, the
director, said that vaccines had contained an outbreak in the Netherlands
in 8 days, whereas in 2001 "the UK, which did not use vaccination, took
months to bring the disease under control," he said.
The usually bustling Hunts Hill Farm was silent yesterday [10 Aug 2007] as
John Emerson received the news that his livestock were free of FMD. All of
his 362 animals, 338 of them pigs, had already been culled as a precaution
after the disease was detected in cattle at a nearby farm.
On Wednesday [8 Aug 2007] the Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs (Defra) decided that the Emersons' livestock had suffered
"dangerous contact" with cattle on John Gunner's farm in Normandy, where
the 2nd case of FMD was confirmed last week [3 Aug 2007]. The news that his
pigs never had the disease left him with "mixed feelings." There was
sadness for his animals and concern for the future of the farm but at the
same time he recognised the disease had to be controlled.
Officials at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs decided
this week [9 Aug 2007] that the ban on the movement of animals outside the
protection and surveillance zones could be relaxed, allowing livestock to
be taken to abattoirs and for dead animals to be removed from farms.

[One can suspect that in the coming weeks we will hear louder and louder
disillusioned comments from British farmers sparked not just by these
outbreaks in relation to the Pirbright institutes and their questioned
biosecurity but by an accumulation of events. The effectiveness of
footbaths has always been questioned. While DEFRA and the prime minister
are putting out the message that "the countryside is open" and the "UK is
open for business" it is understandable that farmers should wonder why so
many constraints were imposed on them far from Surrey, though veterinary
experience has again and again shown that such stoppages are very
important. It is the old problem that if you do something, and nothing
happens, the act is then questioned.
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) has said
Hunts Hill Farm inside the surveillance zone, where 362 cows, sheep, pigs,
and goats were destroyed as a precautionary measure, did not have the
disease. Farmer John Emerson voiced his frustration after it was confirmed
the slaughtered animals were not infected: "When we 1st heard the herds
next door to ours were infected we thought it was inevitable ours would get
it too. But knowing now that my animals were never infected makes it worse."
In the past -- that is, pre-1980 -- when we killed "contact" herds it was
not questioned and laboratory techniques then could not have handled the
volumes of samples. Today all that is different and thousands of samples
are run each day. This brings home the point that the laboratory must move
into the field and test animals quickly before irreversible actions are taken.
I also fear that solicitors may well be briefing barristers and life could
become very expensive for the British government. - Mod.MHJ
