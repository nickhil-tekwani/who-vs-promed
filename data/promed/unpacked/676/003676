[Spain and the FYR Macedonia join the group of countries in Europe to have recently reported EIA. During 2017, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland have reported cases of EIA.

It may be assumed but deserves confirmation that the new EIA cases in 2 additional European countries, Spain and FYR Macedonia, involve polo horses, the animals found earlier infected in Germany, Netherlands and Switzerland.

"The Thoroughbred Breeders' Association (TBA) has recently been made aware that cases of EIA have been confirmed in Germany (9 cases in multiple locations), the Netherlands (one case) and Switzerland (one case). It is believed that these cases all involve polo ponies and perhaps imports from Argentina.

"We have assurances from the German TBA that, currently, there is no evidence to suggest that German thoroughbred horses are involved in this outbreak. However, given the link between the European cases with imports from Argentina, the UK government's Defra/APHA is now investigating polo ponies that have been recently imported directly or indirectly from that country. As of 12 Jul 2017, no positive cases have been confirmed in the UK.

"The TBA would like to remind members of the importance of applying strict bio-security protocols on stud farms at all times and in all circumstances, guidance on which should be sought from your veterinary surgeon and from the HBLB Codes of Practice" https://www.thetba.co.uk/equine-infectious-anaemia-eia-europe/.
