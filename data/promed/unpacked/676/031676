-------------------------------------------------
The Melbourne-based WHO Collaborating Centre for Influenza stated yesterday
[6 May 1997]
that they were concerned over the possibility of a higher number of deaths
from Type B flu this year, after there having been no outbreaks since 1982.
The elderly or those with heart/lung conditions were urged to seek
immediate vaccination, while young children should be left to allow them to
develop increased immunity for the future.
There is an annual average of
between 1000 & 1500 deaths a year in Australia from severe cases of flu;
however the WHO Centre Director, Mr. Alan Hampson, is quoted as saying
"We would expect the possibility of major outbreaks this year."
In most years, 20% of people are infected with influenza, but [the rate]
is expected to rise to about 30% this year.
