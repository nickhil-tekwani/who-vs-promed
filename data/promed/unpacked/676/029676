Veterinary authorities in Botswana on [Mon 19 Feb 2018] reported a fresh outbreak of Newcastle disease in the central part of the country. The disease was first suspected after the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources Conservation and Tourism discovered that wild doves and other unnamed birds showed [clinical signs] corresponding to the disease before dying within a day or 2.

The outbreak was confirmed by the director of the Veterinary Department in the ministry, Letlhogile Modisa. "The public is informed that an investigation into deaths of doves that were reported in parts of central district has been completed. The disease is confirmed as Newcastle disease," said Modisa.

He advised poultry farmers to vaccinate their birds and to avoid unnecessary contact with the dead birds.

"The public is urged to be vigilant and report any deaths to the nearest Veterinary Office," he said.

Environment, Natural Resources Conservation and Tourism permanent secretary Jimmy Opelo last week [week of 12 Feb 2018] reported that a significant number of dead dove carcasses had been spotted in the country's Central district.

[Avian paramyxovirus 1 (APMV-1; fam. Paramyxoviridae) is the etiologic agent of Newcastle disease. APMV-1 strains maintained in Columbiformes have some antigenic differences from other APMV-1 isolates, and are sometimes called pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1), which was first reported in racing pigeons in Italy in 1981, and then it became pandemic.

Several Newcastle disease outbreaks in chickens have been attributed to PPMV-1, which makes it a real threat to the poultry industry. - Mod.PMB
