Threats to future of fishing in Texas
-------------------------------------
Biologists with the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department's (TPWD) fisheries
are scrambling to find baby striped and hybrid striped bass to stock in
Texas lakes after a little-known algae wiped out the year's entire hatchery
crop. The deadly golden algae have been monitored since [they appeared in
3 lakes along the Brazos River drainage earlier this year. After killing
stripers and hybrid stripers in Possum Kingdom, Lake Granbury, and Lake
Whitney, the algae bloom infected the brood ponds at Dundee State Fish
Hatchery near Wichita Falls.
Fry -- tiny, just-hatched baby fish -- from the 28 million striped bass
eggs and 37 million hybrid bass eggs were killed by toxins generated by the
algae. Biologists are hoping to capture adult female stripers [that have
not [yet spawned and also are talking with Oklahoma and Louisiana about
helping in salvaging this year's striper stocking.
"We're at the very end of the striper spawning run," said Gary Saul, chief
of TPWD's hatchery operations. "If we can't collect enough females to pull
off a spawn, we'll have to go with a straight fry stocking instead of
allowing the fish to grow to fingerling size. Because the toxins are still
present at Dundee, we can't risk using our hatchery grow-out ponds." Saul
said the department is bringing together a team of biologists and
scientists to find answers. "We need to know what we can do now if the
algae is still persistent and what needs to be done in the future to avoid
another catastrophe," he said.
Not stocking stripers or hybrids for one year [is one possibility.
Two issues raised by the hatchery failure remain critical to freshwater
fishing in the future:
-- stocking dependent fish stocks: striped bass and hybrid striped bass are
creatures of the laboratory in Texas. Stripers are, technically, saltwater
fish spawning in fresh water. They don't actually spawn in any lakes in
Texas, though they have managed to reproduce in the Lake Texoma drainage
along the Red River. In all other lakes and rivers in Texas, although they
have been very successful as sport fish, stripers must be stocked to
maintain viable populations.
-- hybrid striped bass are a product of crossing white bass and striped
bass. They grow quickly and are a quality game fish in a number of lakes in
Texas. However, they do not reproduce either, and must be stocked on a
regular basis to keep their numbers high enough for anglers and consumers
to enjoy.
[Other forms of waterborne toxins [also pose a threat. The arrival 3
years ago of largemouth bass virus in Texas caused extensive fish kills in
Lake Sam Rayburn and Lake Fork. Particularly hard hit were older, large
adult bass, the ones anglers want to catch and the ones that are among the
best spawners in the population. TPWD has been testing for the virus in
lakes around the state and has found it virtually everywhere.
