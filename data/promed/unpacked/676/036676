[A number of well-informed subscribers wrote to inform of us of the
possibility of _Parelaphostrongylus tenuis_ or the brain worm. We
appreciate all of you pointing out the possibility. Below is the most
official post, as well as a couple of suggestions from other areas of the
world. ­ Mod.TG

I am a wildlife pathologist in the Canadian Cooperative Wildlife Health
Centre, Atlantic Region, University of Prince Edward Island. I have
performed the necropsy examinations on all the moose described in the
newspaper article. Please find below an article written for our Wildlife
Health Centre Newsletter [Summer 2001 8(1): 6-7about this condition
in moose.
Basically, the central nervous system lesions suggest a viral etiology,
but other infectious diseases, nutritional problems, or toxicities have
not been ruled out.
The last moose necropsied with similar lesions was received last
spring. We are currently awaiting an opportunity to capture an animal
with a similar clinical presentation alive. Maintaining the animal in
captivity would permit a complete clinical/neurological examination to
be performed together with additional diagnostic tests (e.g., complete
blood count, chemistry, serology).
It is hoped that observing the progression of or recovery from the
disease, combined with the ongoing ability to collect diagnostic data,
will permit a more accurate assessment of the problem, eventually
leading to a specific diagnosis of the etiology. I hope this information
provides your readership with the additional information they require.

Neurological Disease in Moose in Nova Scotia
Moose mortality is being investigated as a part of an ongoing moose
study initiated by the Nova Scotia Department of Natural Resources. In
2000, this resulted in a detailed postmortem examination of 12 moose
submitted to the Atlantic Veterinary College diagnostic laboratory.
Emaciation or trauma was the cause of death in 6 of the animals. The
remaining individuals were interesting in that they all exhibited
neurological abnormalities prior to their death. The abnormalities
ranged from aberrant behaviour such as loss of fear of humans and
circling, to locomotor difficulties such as incoordination and inability
to rise due to paralysis of the hind legs.
_Parelaphostrongylus tenuis_ is potentially present on the range of
these moose, so it was strongly considered as a cause of their
neurological problems. Focal eosinophilic inflammation compatible
with aberrant migration of _P. tenuis_ larvae was present in the brain
and/or spinal cord of 2 of the moose, although the larvae themselves
were not identified in either animal.
The 4 remaining moose were found to be in very good body condition.
They also had brain lesions, but the changes were not consistent with
those of parelaphostrongylosis. In these cases, the inflammation was
diffuse (i.e., found throughout all levels of the brain, spinal cord, and
meninges) rather than focal, as would be expected with a parasite.
Also, the inflammation was nonsuppurative, consisting of plasma cells,
lymphocytes, and macrophages, with a complete absence of the
eosinophils typically associated with a parasitic problem. The lesions
were sufficient to have been related to the behavioral and physical
changes observed in the moose but, unfortunately, their cause was not
determined.
These microscopic changes are most suggestive of an infectious
process, and the mononuclear inflammation is consistent with a viral
etiology.
However, other pathogens (e.g., protozoal organisms), nutritional
diseases, and toxicities are also being considered. Postmortem
examinations of moose exhibiting neurological abnormalities will
continue, but capturing one of the affected moose alive for monitoring
in captivity is also a possibility. This would enable additional clinical
diagnostic work to be performed as well as observation of the
progression of the disease in an attempt to determine the cause of the
problem.

It sounds similar to the so-called enzootic ataxia known [in red deer
and other species of wild deer and elk.
Not much is known about the cause of enzootic ataxia, but it is thought
to be related to copper deficiency. Other diseases are of course
[possible and should be ruled out by necropsy and histological
investigation of the CNS.

[Although Dr. McBurney did not mention enzootic ataxia, or even if
this disease affects moose, it may well have been ruled out based upon
the histological examination of the tissues. Dr. McBurney, we would be
glad to have your comments. ­ Mod.TG

This condition affecting Moose in Nova Scotia sounds very similar to a
prion-caused illness such as BSE in UK and Europe. Has this been
investigated?

Could this be tick paralysis? Does anyone know if the Winter tick,
_Dermacentor albipictus_, is active at this time of year? And if so, has
this species ever been implicated in tick paralysis?
