'Rapidly accelerating' measles outbreak kills almost 700 children in Zimbabwe
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A measles outbreak in Zimbabwe has now killed nearly 700 children, in a rapidly accelerating and "deeply concerning" flare-up of the highly contagious disease.

Health officials told the Telegraph they were alarmed by both the speed of the spread and the high fatality rate of the outbreak, which has seen the recent death toll jump by dozens each day.

The flare-up of one of the world's most infectious diseases has taken hold among church congregations that have rejected vaccinations for religious reasons.

Deaths had reached 698 by [4 Sep 2022], according to the nation's health ministry, up from less than a quarter of that a fortnight earlier [21 Aug 2022]. Officials reported that 37 children died on [1 Sep 2022] alone.

The outbreak is thought to be the worst for some time in the southern African nation of 15 million. The last outbreak 11 years ago [2011] was far less severe, health sources told the Telegraph.

Unicef said that in the worst affected eastern province of Manicaland, nearly 1-in-10 of those getting the disease were dying. That rate is higher than in other recent African outbreaks.

The UN body said it was "deeply concerned with the numbers of cases and deaths among children due to a measles outbreak in Zimbabwe".

Cases first emerged in April [2022] and the virus has since spread quickly among congregations of Zimbabwe's Apostolic churches, who have long rejected vaccinations and modern medicine.

Faith healers and anti-vaxxers
------------------------------
Dr Johannes Marisa, the president of the Medical and Dental Private Practitioners of Zimbabwe Association, told The Associated Press that the government may need to force children to be vaccinated.

He said: "Because of the resistance, education may not be enough so the government should also consider using coercive measures to ensure that no one is allowed to refuse vaccination for their children."

He urged the government to "consider enacting legislation that makes vaccination against killer diseases such as measles mandatory".

Zimbabwe's Cabinet has already invoked a law used to respond to disasters to deal with the outbreak and has launched a mass vaccination campaign, which will target 2 million children under 5 years. Nationwide, the vaccination rate was around 85% in 2020, having fallen back on previous years when it at times touched 95%.

The country's Apostolic churches or sects are thought to be followed by around 1-in-5 of the population. Their teachings regularly include a potent mix of opposition towards Western medicine and belief in faith healing and prayer, meaning the congregations have become a stronghold of anti-vaccination sentiment.

As the outbreak has worsened and pressure has mounted, some church leaders have in recent weeks appeared to change their stance and called on followers to get their children vaccinated.

The virus causes fever, coughing and a tell-tale rash, but in some cases it causes complications that can be fatal. Complications include blindness, brain swelling, severe diarrhoea and dehydration, ear infections, or severe respiratory infections such as pneumonia.

It is one of the world's most contagious diseases, with a reproduction rate as high as 18 -- compared to an R rate of between 2 and 3 for the original strain of COVID.

Before mass vaccinations began in the 1960s, the disease flared up in occasional epidemics, killing an estimated 2.6 million children each year.

More than 140 000 people died from measles in 2018 -- mostly children under the age of 5 years, despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine, according to the World Health Organization. The virus is so contagious that more than 90% of the population needs to be immunised to prevent outbreaks.

[The outbreak, which started in the eastern Manicaland province, has now spread across the country, with 6291 cases as of 4 Sep 2022 [6551 as of 9 Sep 2022 and 704 deaths]. This is tragic, especially in light of the availability of an effective and safe vaccine. Furthermore, measles can lead to serious complications in malnourished children more often than in well-nourished children. Thus, it is important that public health officials work with the religious and faith leaders to help the parents understand how important it is that their children get vaccinated. - Mod.LK]

Zimbabwe measles outbreak: death toll tops 700, vaccination drive immunizes 27% of target population
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In a follow-up to the measles outbreak concentrated in the eastern part of Zimbabwe, the health ministry reported an additional 6 suspected measles deaths from Masvingo, bringing the death toll to 704 since April this year [2022].

As of [6 Sep 2022], Zimbabwe has reported 6551 measles cases during this period, nearly half from Manicaland. A vaccination drive that began on [29 Aug 2022] ended today [10 Sep 2022]. The target was 2.3 million children between the ages of 6 to 59 months.

Approximately 26.9% of the target, or 623 810 were vaccinated.
