Phylogenetic analysis in a recent controlled outbreak of Crimean-Congo
haemorrhagic fever in the south of Iran
-----------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral zoonotic disease with a
high mortality rate in humans. The CCHF virus is transmitted to humans
through the bite of Ixodid ticks or contact with blood or tissues of CCHF
patients or infected livestock. In December 2008, a re-emerging outbreak of
CCHF occurred in the southern part of Iran. 5 people were hospitalised with
sudden fever and haemorrhaging, and CCHF was confirmed by RT-PCR and
serological assays. One of the cases had a fulminant course and died.

Livestock was identified as the source of infection; all animals in the
incriminated herd were serologically analysed and more than half of them
were positive for CCHFV. We demonstrated that 2 routes of transmission
played a role in this outbreak: contact with tissue and blood of infected
livestock, and nosocomial transmission. Phylogenetic analyses helped to
identify the origin of this transmission. This outbreak should be
considered as a warning for the national CCHF surveillance system to avoid
further outbreaks through robust prevention and control programmes.

[CCHF virus infections have occurred sporadically in cattle and people in
Iran since its introduction in 1973. An historical summary of these
outbreaks can be found in ProMED-mail archive no. 20100913.3303. This virus
can be transmitted to humans and livestock via Ixodid (hard) ticks,
exposure to blood and tissues of infected livestock, especially in
slaughterhouses, or nosocomially by contact with blood and secretions of
infected patients in the absence of barrier nursing and patient care.
