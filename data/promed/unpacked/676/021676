[The official tallies for 20 Jun 2015 were not posted until after yesterday's update was published. The media report that was used mentioned there were no new cases and no new fatalities, but it did not mention there were 6 new discharges from the hospital, explaining why the number of discharges is now up to 43.

As of the morning of 21 Jun 2015 (Korean time) there have now been 169 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 25 deaths in South Korea (reported case fatality rate of 14.8 percent). The 3 newly confirmed cases mentioned in today's update are all 4th generation cases as the case contacts they had were 3rd generation cases (patient no.76 and no.135 were both 3rd generation cases. Two of the 3 newly confirmed cases are in healthcare workers - 1 physician and 1 radiology technician. To date there has been only 1 probable 5th generation case (case no. 163, a nurse whose contacts are still under investigation but include a 4th generation case).

All cases to date can be traced to contact within the healthcare environment with the exception of an ambulance driver and presumed EMT working with the ambulance transporting case no.76 to the hospitals.

http://english.mw.go.kr/front_eng/sg/ssg0111vw.jsp?PAR_MENU_ID=1001&MENU_ID=100111&page=1&CONT_SEQ=323609


Statistics (No. of persons)
Confirmed Case: 166
Discharged: 30
Death: 24
Under Treatment: 112

Case No.166 is a family member of the patient who stayed at the Samsung Medical Center (Seoul) between 25 May 2015 and 5 Jun 2015.

Profile of fatalities:
Male: 17 (71 percent), female: 7 (29 percent), persons above 60: 19 (79 percent)

- 22 (92 percent) were high-risk, old-age patients with underlying medical conditions such as cardio-cerebrovascular disease, cancer and chronic respiratory disease.

Of the 112 patients currently under treatment: 16 are in severe conditions, and 96 in moderate conditions

Confirmed Case: 116
Being Tested: 132
Under Quarantine: 5930
- home quarantine: 5161
- in hospital quarantine: 769
- released from quarantine: 5535

Update on the Samsung Medical Center (Seoul)
- Infection prevention and control measures have been scaled up. 41 930 people who visited the hospital during the periods of high MERS exposure have been reached through text messages or phone calls. The number of contacts increased to 7000 as a result of using a more conservative counting method.

- Residents of Seoul should report to the Dasan Call Center (120) or the official website of the Seoul metropolitan city. Residents of other areas should report through the Korean government's official website for the MERS outbreak (http://mers.go.kr).

- The government understands the ordeal of those under house quarantine and expresses its deepest appreciation for their cooperation. Complying with quarantine measures is essential for stopping the further spread of MERS-CoV. The Director-General of WHO, Dr. Margaret Chan, also stressed that the cooperation of the community and the general public is crucial for ending the MERS outbreak as early as possible. Thus, continued cooperation will be greatly appreciated.

- The government will ensure that 2650 affiliated hospitals will provide medical services and prescriptions to the patients who were cared for by the Samsung Medical Center prior to the MERS outbreak.

Funerals
- Individuals under house quarantine will be allowed to visit their loved ones in critical conditions and attend their death beds while wearing protective gear. It is also possible for the quarantined individuals to carry the corpses of their loved ones to cremation facilities. However, there will be a limit to the number of those who can be part of this funeral process.

The quarantined individuals must adhere to the following instructions:
- Discuss with hospital staff how many family members will attend the funeral
- Contact local public health centers to borrow protective gear and wear them
- Go to the hospital in a vehicle provided by the public health center
- Keep your protective gear on until you return home

Update on Hospitals Under Strict Control
- Proactive measures have been taken to stop further infections at Gang-dong Kyung Hee University Hospital where a number of dialysis patients were exposed to MERS (109).

The list of 109 patients was sent to all dialysis facilities across the nation through HIRA (Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service). Those on the list are banned from visiting other dialysis rooms at will.

- As of today [20 Jun 2015], new non-MERS patients cannot be admitted to the hospital. A dialysis patient with high MERS exposure will be given priority in entering an isolated single room if a patient is discharged. Individuals under house quarantine will be strictly monitored and be transported by the designated ambulances if necessary.

- It was found that case no.165 was not infected within a dialysis room. Nonetheless, the government will strengthen cooperation with the hospital in order to prevent the virus from spreading through dialysis rooms.

- Previously, 65 patients were put under cohort quarantine on the 7th floor along with confirmed cases at Asan Chungmu Hospital. Currently, among these quarantined individuals, 48 have been isolated in single rooms and 17 have been relocated to another hospital in order to strengthen infection control.

- Additional medical staff members have been recruited through the Ministry of National Defense, the Korean Hospital Association (KHA) and the Korean Nurses Association (KNA) to support the Hospitals Under Strict Control whose staff members are suffering from increasing fatigue.

- The government expresses its appreciation to the private sector, KHA and KNA for their active cooperation, and asks the Korean Medical Association (KMA) for their participation.

[The above information comes from the English pages of the Korean MOH website. The information provided on the hospitals is new, with mention of the possible exposures in the dialysis unit of one of the hospitals and the actions that are being taken. It is also impressive to see the number of individuals that the MOH is attempting to contact re: possible exposure in the Samsung hospital ... 41 930 individuals who were in the hospital during periods of "high MERS exposure", with contact being made through text messages or phone calls ... a massive undertaking. - Mod.MPP]

[3] Saudi Arabia, 1 new case - MOH 20 Jun 2015, RFI

As of 12:00 noon today, 20 Jun 2015, there have been a total of:
1038 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
459 deaths,
572 recoveries, and
7 currently active cases

In the past 24 hours there has been
1 newly confirmed case
0 new fatalities, and
1 new recovery

[Reported case fatality rate 44.2 percent]

Information on newly confirmed case:
A 60-year-old expat female healthcare worker from Hufoof noted to be in stable condition. At time of initial report, gave a history of contact with other case(s) in either the healthcare environment or the community.

Information on newly reported recovery:
A 60-year-old Saudi female, non-healthcare worker from Hufoof with a history of pre-existing co-morbidities. [Initially reported as a laboratory-confirmed case on 10 Jun 2015, at which time was noted to be in stable condition, and a possible history of contact with other case(s) was under review. - Mod.MPP]

[The outbreak on Hufoof continues with 1 newly confirmed case in a healthcare worker and 1 fatality in a previously confirmed case. Using 20 Apr 2015 as the start date of this major outbreak in Hufoof, there have been 38 cases including 18 deaths (reported case fatality rate 47.4 percent).

Reviewing the information available on reported cases of MERS-CoV infection in Hufoof since 2014, it appears as though there were 2 presumably sporadic cases reported in 2014 -- one in July and one in October. Since the beginning of January there have been 45 cases including 20 deaths (reported case fatality rate 44.4 percent) reported from Hufoof. On 20 Jan 2015 there was a case reported that gave a history of exposure to camels during the 14 days preceding onset of illness. There were then cases reported on 2, 3, 24 Feb 2015, and 8, 14, 29 Mar 2015 with only the case reported on 24 Feb 2015 giving a history of contact with another MERS-CoV positive case in the healthcare environment. The next reported case was on 20 Apr 2015 -- 22 days after the last reported case. This case did not have a history of known high-risk exposures during the 14 days preceding onset of illness. Beginning 5 May 2015 through the present were reports of cases with either definite histories of contact with other cases -- initially "in the community" (having been identified as household contacts) and then in the healthcare environment. So the question that comes to mind is whether genetic profiles of the viruses involved in January, February and March 2015 have been done and likewise if studies on the viruses involved in April 2015 through the present have been done to see if the same lineages of virus were involved since January 2015 vs. multiple different viral introductions until April/May when the hospital associated outbreak has been defined as having begun. If any of our readers have information on this, ProMED would greatly appreciate receiving it.

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Thailand
------------------------------------------------------------------
On [18 Jun 2015], the National IHR Focal Point of Thailand notified WHO of the country's 1st confirmed case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

Details of the case are as follows:
The case is a 75-year-old, Omani male that travelled from Oman to Thailand to seek medical care. The patient, who has comorbidities, developed symptoms on [10 Jun 2015] and was admitted to hospital in Oman. As symptoms did not improve, he decided to travel to Thailand to seek treatment. He took a flight with 3 family members and arrived in Bangkok on [15 Jun 2015]. Neither the patient nor his family members reported fever upon arrival in Thailand. He was admitted to hospital on [15 Jun 2015] and tested positive for MERS-CoV on [18 Jun 2015]. On [18 Jun 2015], the patient and his 3 family members were transferred to another health care facility where they were put in isolation. Currently, the patient is in stable condition.

Public health response
National health authorities in Thailand are implementing the following public health measures:
- reviewing and strengthening infection prevention and control measures at the hospital where the patient was initially admitted,
- carrying out contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts,
- activating the Emergency Operation Center as well as the preparedness and response units.
- Information on this event is also being shared between the 2 concerned countries, Thailand and Oman.

Global situation
Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1334 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 471 related deaths.

WHO advice
Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.

Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‐CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.

Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

[The plot thickens. The above WHO summary mentions that the patient developed symptoms on 10 Jun 2015 and was treated in a hospital in Oman prior to travelling to Thailand for treatment. An earlier report mentioned he travelled to Thailand for treatment of cardiac disease. A question that comes to mind is whether the individual was treated in a hospital in Oman for cardiac symptoms, where he may have been exposed to MERS-CoV, and then on arrival in Thailand developed symptoms consistent with MERS-CoV infection? Or perhaps, did the individual have symptoms consistent with a MERS-CoV infection in Oman where the diagnosis of MERS-CoV was missed? Hopefully there is an ongoing investigation into possible undiagnosed MERS-CoV infections in the hospital where this individual was treated in Oman as a source of his infection. And hopefully the findings of this investigation will be shared.

A media report today (20 Jun 2015) mentioned that 175 individuals are being followed for possible exposure to this patient (http://bangkokpost.com/news/general/598332/mers-exposure-reaches-175).
