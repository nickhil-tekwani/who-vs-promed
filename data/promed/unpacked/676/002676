3 Presumptive Cases of Human West Nile Virus Infection in Connecticut
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The State of Connecticut Departments of Public Health and Environmental
Protection today announced the first presumptive cases of West Nile virus
(WNV) infection in Connecticut this year. 3 persons tested positive for WNV
on screening tests performed at the Department of Public Health Laboratory
after being hospitalized with meningitis or encephalitis in late August or
early September. One person is a resident of Fairfield, another a resident
of West Haven and the third person was a tourist who vacationed in Staten
Island, New York and Norwalk, Connecticut before becoming ill. The
presumptive Fairfield and Norwalk cases have been discharged from the
hospital and are recovering, while the West Haven resident is still
hospitalized.
The Fairfield and Norwalk cases were most likely exposed to infected
mosquitoes sometime in early August. Both are persons in their sixties and
became ill early in the third week of August and were hospitalized several
days later. The West Haven resident, a 70+ year old person, became ill
during the last few days of August and was admitted to the hospital several
days later with meningoencephalitis. This patient remains in the hospital
in critical condition. The likely date of exposure for the West Haven case
was sometime during the last 2 weeks of August.
Confirmatory tests on all 3 persons will be performed at the Centers for
Disease Control Laboratory in Fort Collins Colorado next week. While the
Norwalk visitor may have been infected during a stay in Staten Island prior
to coming to Connecticut, the other 2 persons were clearly infected with
WNV in Connecticut. Both spent substantial time outdoors most days in their
yards. At least one does not routinely use mosquito repellent.

[These 3 (presumptive?) cases of human West Nile virus infection in
Connecticut bring the US national total this year to 14: 4 in Florida, 4 in
New York, 3 in Connecticut, 1 (fatal) in Georgia, 1 in New Jersey and 1 in
Maryland. These 3 cases are the first cases of acute human WNV infection
reported in Connecticut. One case of mild illness was reported in 2000. -
