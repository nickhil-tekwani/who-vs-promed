Cryptosporidiosis Cases On The Rise
------------------------------------
The number of confirmed cases of cryptosporidiosis is growing [in Tazewell
County. As of Friday morning the Tazewell County Health Department reports
18 confirmed cases of people infected with the parasite and the Peoria
County Health Department one confirmed case.
Tazewell officials believe the victims were exposed at the Splashdown
Aquatic Center in East Peoria (see story below). Officials say that
cryptosporidiosis might have spread to other public swimming pools
throughout the area.
County health officials are asking pool operators to super chlorinate their
water to kill the microbe. They believe hundreds of people could be
infected. Within the last 2 days officials at the Illinois Department of
Public Health say 6 other central Illinois pools have done or are planning
to super chlorinate. Some, like the Pekin YWCA, were scheduled to close
later this week, so they simply pushed it up a few days.
The Tazewell County Health Department continues to update their website and
has tips on avoiding infection: <http://www.dpc.net/~tchd/crypto.html>.
