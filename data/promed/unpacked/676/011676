The number of deaths is still uncertain. It has been presumptively diagnosed as yellow fever. Knowing the mode of transmission of yellow fever and the low population immunity especially in Borno State, more transmission is ongoing. I think ELISA was used for the presumptive diagnosis. Plans are being made to ship the IgM positive samples to Dakar for confirmation. I have also requested that part of the samples should be sent to the Arbovirus Laboratory at University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital (UMTH) for confirmation. At UMTH, plaque assay would be used for confirmation within 4 days.

[The following information was submitted by an EpiCore Surveillance Project member who wishes to remain anonymous.]

The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control [NCDC] has confirmed 4 cases of yellow fever in Bauchi State. 3 of the confirmed cases are residents of Alkaleri Local Government Area (LGA) and the 4th case is a tourist who was visiting Kano State and also visited the Yankari Games Reserve in the same LGA in Bauchi State.

NCDC was first notified on [29 Aug 2019], when it received the report of a confirmed case of yellow fever in Kano State from a laboratory in its yellow fever laboratory network. Subsequent investigations led by the Kano State Epidemiology Team established that this confirmed case of yellow fever was from a patient who visited the Yankari Game Reserve in Bauchi, in August 2019 with his father. Unfortunately, the father died with similar symptoms before a sample could be collected and tested.

Subsequently, on [3 Sep 2019], the Borno State Epidemiology Team reported deaths among students of Waka College of Education in Biu LGA Borno State. These students visited the Yankari Game Resort in August 2019. Of the 95 students who visited the resort, 8 developed symptoms and 6 had died as at the time of the report. The others are in a stable condition. Samples from these cases are being tested.

Intensification of surveillance activities has led to the identification of 3 more confirmed cases who are all resident in Alkaleri Local Government Area (LGA), of Bauchi state.

Altogether, 4 cases of yellow fever were confirmed in people that either live or have visited Bauchi in the last one month.

Since it was notified, the NCDC has collaborated with the State epidemiologists of the affected States and the World Health Organization country office to investigate these events. The agency has also deployed a rapid response team to support Bauchi State to carry out further in-depth investigations, including case finding, risk communications, and support the management of cases. Samples of the other suspected cases from Bauchi and Borno states are currently being transported to the NCDC National Reference Laboratory in Abuja for further testing.

With the recent development in Biu [Local Government Area in southern Borno State], I am very much concerned as a citizen of Nigeria, who also has a connection with Biu. I am a research scientist with the African Center of Excellence for the Genomics of Infectious Disease [ACEGID]. We are located in Redeemers University Ede Osun State and we're concerned with outbreaks as this. My advice will be to send plasma samples of those who are sick and their possible contact for a whole genome sequencing which will unravel these mysterious illness. We have the platform and have used it in such capacity. Contact me at <Eromonp@run.edu.ng> should you want more information. You can also check our site http://www.acegid.org

[ProMED thanks Philomena Eromon, Prof Baba, and anonymous EpiCore members who have submitted rapid responses to this request for further information. The possibility of toxic ingestion as well as yellow fever are discussed by other ProMED moderators as follows. - Mod.LXL

These cases, if limited to the Waka Biu College group, would be unusual for yellow fever on epidemiological grounds. However, the occurrence of a yellow fever case in the Yankari Game Reserve that the students also visited indicates that YF virus was circulating there and there were additional YF cases in the state. Nonetheless, the occurrence of a cluster of 16 simultaneous cases with just one report of other cases in the area where the students and photographers had been argues against yellow fever virus transmission. One would expect to see a chain of cases, not an abrupt outbreak with all coming down with illness at the same time. Sylvan spill-over of YF virus is also unlikely for the same reason. However the case fatality rate (4 dead of 16 cases) is about right for YF. It would be important to know if any of the ill individuals had been vaccinated against YF. Laboratory confirmation of the etiology of these 16 student cases is essential to know the cause of their illness. - Mod.TY

There are very few clinical signs to attempt to make a diagnosis. However, if the individuals did not purchase water or food, then one wonders whether the food they may have taken with them was spoiled in some way. These individuals swam in the water. A number of things come to mind, such as blue-green algae or cyanobacteria, that could be the cause. One also wonders whether the water had coliform or other bacteria or toxins which could have affected these individuals in the manner described. If others have additional information, we would appreciate knowing. Please send to <promed@promedmail.org>. - Mod.TG
