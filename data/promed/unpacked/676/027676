[Cutaneous leishmaniasis is endemic in the northern and western part of Libya, and we assume that these are cutaneous leishmaniasis [CL].

CL is caused by the protozoan _Leishmania_ parasite, which is transmitted by sandflies. Zoonotic CL is endemic in Libya, with sporadic outbreaks. In 2006, over 7000 cases were recorded in 8 districts, with an outbreak of 3961 cases in Misratah, and the disease spread to non-endemic areas (1).

In 2009, the prevalence of CL was 7.1 per 10 000 population. There is a vector control program that involves insecticide spraying, and regular rodent control is performed (2).
