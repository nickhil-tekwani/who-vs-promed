Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 - Somalia [9 Mar 2018]
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Circulation of vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been confirmed in Somalia; 3 cVDPV2s strains were isolated from environmental samples collected on [4 and 11 Jan 2018], in Banadir province (Mogadishu). These latest isolates are genetically linked to cVDPV2 strains collected from environmental samples in the same province on [22 Oct 2017 and 2 Nov 2017].

No associated cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) have been detected.

Public health response
Since detection of the initial isolates in 2017, 2 large-scale immunization campaigns (SIA) in line with internationally-agreed guidelines have been implemented, in Banadir, Lower Shabelle and Middle Shabelle provinces.

A 3rd SIA is planned for March [2018], and further response based on evolving epidemiology and ongoing risk assessment is being evaluated. Surveillance for AFP is being strengthened.

WHO and its partners are continuing to support local public health authorities in conducting field investigations and risk assessments to more clearly assess risk of the identified cVDPV2.

WHO risk assessment
The detection of this cVDPV2 strain underscores the importance of maintaining high levels of routine polio vaccination coverage at all levels to minimize the risk and consequences of any poliovirus circulation. Such event also underscores the risk in areas or regions with continued substantial insecurity that hampers maintaining high population immunity through routine vaccination. WHO will continue to evaluate the epidemiological situation and prevention measures being implemented.

WHO advice
It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in order to rapidly detect any polio case, implement prevention measures, and speed-up the response if needed. Countries should also maintain uniformly on all their territory high polio immunization coverage through routine vaccination to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction or emergence.

WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travelers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV) or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel.

Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to International Health Regulations Temporary Recommendations that request them to report a case of polio as a national public health emergency and consider vaccination of all international travelers. Any country that exports poliovirus should ensure vaccination of all international travelers before departure.

[The above reports contain good news and not so good news.

The good news is that there have been no new cases of either WPV or cVDPV reported in 2018 since the last reports. Another piece of good news is that there has been environmental sampling ongoing in Somalia, a non-endemic country for polio.

The not so good news is that there is continued evidence of poliovirus circulation both WPV and cVDPV as seen in results of environmental sampling. Pakistan and Afghanistan continue to identify WPV in environmental samples in the absence of identifying clinical polio cases, and Somalia has identified cVDPV2 in environmental samples both in 2017 and in 2018, suggesting these viruses have been circulating there for the past 6 months without identified clinical cases of polio. What is unclear is whether the absence of identification of clinical cases associated with the cVDPV2 in Somalia is related to absence of cases, or deficiencies in acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance. According to data maintained by WHO/EMRO on AFP surveillance, for the years 2017 and 2018, Somalia has a reported non-polio AFP rate of 5-6/100 000 population, a rate consistent with good surveillance (data are downloadable from http://www.emro.who.int/polio/countries/somalia.html). That being said, the continued circulation of the cVDPVs are of concern with respect to the goals of the polio eradication effort, as circulation of a pathogenic poliovirus may lead to clinical cases of polio if susceptible individuals are infected with this virus.

Other not so good news is the identification of another case of cVDPV2 associated polio in the Democratic Republic of the Congo with date of onset 22 Dec 2017, suggesting there has been continued circulation of the cVDPV2 in the Ankoro district, of Tanganyika province.
