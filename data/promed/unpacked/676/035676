Tourism is booming again in France -- and so is COVID-19. French officials have "invited" or "recommended" people to go back to using face masks but stopped short of renewing restrictions that would scare visitors away or revive antigovernment protests.

From Paris commuters to tourists on the French Riviera, many people seem to welcome the government's light touch, while some worry that required prevention measures may be needed.

Virus-related hospitalizations rose quickly in France over the past 2 weeks, with nearly 1000 patients with COVID-19 hospitalized per day, according to government data. Infections are also rising across Europe and the United States, but France has an exceptionally high proportion of people in the hospital, according to Our World in Data estimates.

French government spokesperson Olivia Gregoire has said there are no plans to reintroduce national regulations that limit or set conditions for gathering indoors and other activities.

"The French people are sick of restrictions," she said on [Wed 29 Jun 2022] on channel BFMTV. "We are confident that people will behave responsibly."

France's parliamentary elections last month [Jun 2022] resulted in President Emmanuel Macron losing his majority in the national legislature, while parties on the far right and the far left that had protested his government's earlier vaccine and mask rules gained seats.

After the prime minister this week recommended that people resume wearing masks on public transportation, commuter RV said, "We need to deal with the virus, but we can't stop living because of it." RV, who was boarding a train in Boussy-Saint-Antoine south of Paris, said she opposed mandatory mask use but would cover her mouth and nose again, if the government requires it.

HM, a postal worker in Paris, didn't wait for the government to decide. He masks up before his daily commute. With his wife recovering from surgery and 2 children at home, he does not want to risk contracting the coronavirus a 3rd time. "I realized that the pandemic does not belong to the past," HM said.

Masks have been contentious in France. Early in the pandemic, the French government suggested masks weren't helpful. It ultimately introduced some of Europe's toughest restrictions, including an indoors and outside mask mandate that lasted more than a year, along with strict lockdowns.

A Paris court ruled on [Tue 28 Jun 2022] that the French government failed to sufficiently stock up on surgical masks at the start of the pandemic and to prevent the virus from spreading. The administrative court in Paris also ruled that the government was wrong to suggest early on that masks did not protect people from becoming infected.

The government lifted most virus rules by April [2022], and foreign tourists have returned by land, sea and air to French Mediterranean beaches, restaurants and bars.

In the meantime, French hospitals are struggling with long-running staff and funding shortages. Local officials are contemplating new measures, including an indoor mask mandate in some cities, but nothing that would curb economic activity.

French tourism professionals expect a booming summer season despite the virus, with numbers that may even surpass pre-pandemic levels as Americans benefit from the weaker euro and others rediscover foreign travel after more than 2 years of a more circumscribed existence.

On the French Riviera, a slow economic recovery began last summer [2021]. But with attendance at gatherings still capped, social distancing rules and travel restrictions in place a year ago, most visitors to the area were French.

A tour guide and electric bicycle taxi driver in Nice described her joy at seeing foreign visitors again. During France's repeated lockdowns, she transported essential workers, and took people to hospitals, to care for elderly relatives or for PCR tests.

Now, passengers on her bike from the U.S., Australia, Germany, Italy or beyond reach for the hand disinfectant taped to the barrier between the passenger and driver's seats. She said she still diligently disinfects the bike before each ride, "like it's 2020".

[The report states that the French are tired of restrictions, but the expectation is they will behave responsibly. That should include wearing masks indoors and trying to maintain physical distance. With the increase in tourists flowing into the country, that is likely to be difficult without a mandate. - Mod.LK]

[2] Omicron: 2nd generation variant
Date: Sun 3 Jul 2022

Scientists are keeping their eyes on a new SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus) variant descended from the Omicron variant that has an unusual nine mutations on its spike protein and has spread to countries across the globe somewhat faster than other such variants.

The new variant, identified as BA.2.75, was first found in a sequence taken in India in early June [2022]. Since then, the variant has been spotted in Australia, Canada, Japan, Germany, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the US. In just a matter of weeks, the variant has been detected in over 80 sequences around the world.

While it is still unclear if BA.2.75 will be able to compete with BA.5, the dominant variant in many countries at the moment, the number of mutations and its seemingly fast spread across a wide geographic area have scientists keeping an eye on it.

Dr. Shay Fleishon, with the Central Virology Laboratory at Sheba Medical Center in Tel Hashomer, called the new subvariant "alarming," stressing that while it is too soon to tell if this will be the "next dominant variant," it could imply a trend to come.

Dr. Shay Fleishon [@shay fleishon] tweet: BA.2.75 update - 02.07.2022. 85 sequences have been uploaded so far, mainly from India (from 10 states) and 7 other countries. No transmission could be tracked based on sequences outside India yet.

Fleishon explained in a Twitter thread that recent months have seen a trend of variants based on Omicron lineages with mutations in the S1 section of the spike protein and specifically in the part of the spike protein which the virus uses to connect to and gain entry into cells, on a level not seen in 2nd-generation variants from other variants of concern.

Up until now, however, these 2nd-generation variants have only been found in a few cases within one region. This is the first time a 2nd-generation variant from Omicron has spread to multiple regions.

The Bloom Lab at the Fred Hutchinson research institute tweeted that the variant is "worth tracking" due to "appreciable antigenic change" compared to its parent, BA.2. The lab pointed to 2 mutations as key: G446S and R493Q.

Bloom lab tweet [@jbloom lab]: This new #SARSCoV2 Omicron subvariant (BA.2.75) flagged here by @PeacockFlu is worth tracking, as it has appreciable antigenic change relative to its parent BA.2. Key mutations: G446S & R493Q. Here is summary of what those mutations imply for antibody escape & ACE2 affinity (1/n).

G446S is a mutation that could help the virus escape from antibodies elicited by current vaccines that still are effective against BA.2. On the bright side, it seems that those who have already been infected by BA.1 will not be as at risk of reinfection by BA.2.75. The R493Q mutation, meanwhile, seems to increase the virus's ability to attach to ACE2, the protein which the coronavirus uses to enter cells.

N460K, another mutation on the BA.2.75 variant, also increases the virus's ability to attach to ACE2, according to the Bloom Lab.

All the scientists who commented on the new variant agreed that more information is needed before we know just how significant BA.2.75 will be, with expectations that the coming weeks will show if it can compete against BA.5 or not.

According to the United Kingdom's i news, the UK Health Security Agency is aware of the new variant, but a source told the newspaper that it was just one of a number of new strains being monitored and that it was not yet a cause for concern.

[3] Paxlovid

Germany's health minister said on [Sun 3 Jul 2022] he will push for more prescriptions of Pfizer's oral COVID-19 antiviral treatment Paxlovid by family doctors to reduce severe cases of the disease.

"A system involving family doctors will be prepared to administer this far too rarely-used COVID life saver more routinely," he wrote on Twitter on [Sun 3 Jul 2022], adding that sufficient stockpiles were available.

The pill, which won conditional European marketing approval in January [2022], is given to infected people who are at high risk of progression to severe illness.

In his tweet, Lauterbach mentioned trial results that the oral treatment course can cut the risk of hospitalisation in the elderly by 90%, when taken early after infection.

Pfizer said on [Thu 30 Jun 2022] it is seeking full U.S. approval for Paxlovid, which is currently available under an emergency use authorization there. https://tinyurl.com/yckwnj33.

Deaths and intensive care treatments after COVID-19 infections have been on the rise again in Germany since late June [2022], driven by more infectious subvariants of Omicron, after falling steadily for about 3 months.

The drug was not found to ease symptoms among younger adults. https://tinyurl.com/49wfrxdb.

German chancellor Olaf Scholz, a member of centre-left SPD like Lauterbach, on [Sun 3 Jul 2022] said schools and non-essential businesses would not be shut again if infection rates rose significantly this year [2022], but that face masks would play a bigger role. https://tinyurl.com/37av9sda

[Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said on Tuesday (28 Jun 2022) that it would halt enrollment in a trial for its COVID-19 antiviral drug, Paxlovid, in standard-risk patients after a study revealed the treatment was not effective in reducing symptoms in that group. The drug has emergency use authorization for high-risk groups in which it has been effective in reducing hospitalizations and deaths.

The new data, however, showed a 51% relative risk reduction in standard-risk groups, which the company said was not statistically significant. (https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/pfizer-stops-enrollment-paxlovid-trial-standard-risk-population-2022-06-14/). - Mod.LK]

There has been a sharp decline in the number of reported cases and deaths, with 2 regions not reporting data over the weekend. These numbers likely reflect under reporting and not an actual reduction in the figures.

- The Americas region reported no cases or deaths during the past 24 hours, having reported more than 162.97 million cases, 2nd to the European region, the most severely affected region.

- The European region reported 49.1% of cases and 37.4% of deaths over the last 24 hours, as the most effected region, with cumulative cases exceeding 229.03 million. Many countries did not report cases in the last 24 hours or longer including France, Germany, the UK, Turkey, Spain, Ukraine, Belgium, Romania, Denmark, and Tajikistan, among others. A total of 5 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours, no country reporting more than 100 000 cases, 3 countries reporting more than 10 000, 2 reporting over 1000 cases, while 4 countries reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 6.4% cases and 4.1% deaths during the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 22.05 million cases. Iraq (2364) reported the highest number of cases over the last 24 hours followed by UAE, Morocco, Jordan, Bahrain. Iran, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon reported more than 500 but less than 1000 cases over the last 24 hours.

- The African region reported no cases or deaths during the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 9.12 million cases.

- The Western Pacific region reported 34.8% of daily case numbers and 41.2% deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 64.51 million cases.
