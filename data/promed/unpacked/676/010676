An infectious virus linked to 2 diseases is drawing the attention of
public-health officials, who are investigating the potential threat
to the nation's blood supply. It isn't clear if the virus, known as
XMRV [xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus], poses a
danger, and public-health officials say there isn't evidence of
spreading infection. But because of concern over the potential for
widespread infection and preliminary evidence that XMRV is
transmitted similarly to HIV [human immunodeficiency virus],
officials are quickly trying to determine if action is needed to
protect the blood supply.

XMRV was discovered in 2006 when it was found in tumor samples from
men with a rare form of familial prostate cancer. Research has also
linked the virus to chronic fatigue syndrome [CFS] and found it in
measurable levels in the blood of healthy people [see ProMED-mail
Chronic fatigue syndrome: gammaretrovirus link 20091009.3499]. But
the evidence isn't conclusive, as several other studies failed to
find XMRV in the blood of people with chronic fatigue syndrome, and
it isn't known how prevalent the virus is or whether it causes
disease [see ProMED-mail Chronic fatigue syndrome: gamma retrovirus
link disputed 20100107.0078]. "These are early days trying to
understand the public health significance of XMRV," said Jay Epstein,
director of the Office of Blood Research and Review at the Food and
Drug Administration. Efforts are under way to find effective tests
for the virus and determine its prevalence, led by a working group
funded by the National Institutes of Health and including federal
agencies such as the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. Blood banks, academic institutions, and at least one
advocacy group are also involved.

The focus on XMRV is part of a growing effort to better monitor
emerging infections -- disorders that have either increased in humans
in recent decades or are deemed a potential threat. Currently there
are 12 tests used to block infectious agents from entering the blood
supply, such as HIV or hepatitis C [virus], and more screens are
under study, including those for dengue, human variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and agents that cause malaria. There is no
FDA-licensed lab test for XMRV, and officials say they are still
setting standards for diagnosing it.

Public-health officials increasingly recognize that even infections
not typically found in the US can quickly come here because of global
travel. Many viruses also have long incubation periods, making it
harder to recognize that the virus was transmitted by a blood
transfusion. In an October 2009 report, a federal advisory committee
on blood safety and availability concluded that biovigilance in the
US is a "patchwork of activities, not a cohesive national program."
The incidence of infectious diseases being transmitted through
transfusions is small, typically only a handful each year, according
to the American Red Cross and data reported to the FDA. About 16
million units of whole blood and red blood cells were donated in the
US in 2006, the latest data available, according to the 2007 National
Blood Collection and Utilization Report. The American Red Cross,
which collects almost half of blood donations in the US, estimated
that about 10 000 donors a year turn out to be infected with
pathogens that officials screen for. Nearly half are hepatitis C
virus [positive].

Michael P Busch, who runs the Blood Systems Research Institute in San
Francisco and is a member of the XMRV working group, notes that
everyone harbors benign viral infections. These viruses are
transmitted in every blood transfusion, but aren't known to cause
diseases in recipients, says Dr Busch. Even if XMRV is found to be
present in large numbers of blood donors, Dr Busch notes, it is still
necessary to determine if XMRV causes diseases.

The working group was established after a paper was published in
October [2009] in the journal Science [abstract available at
<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1179052>], where
researchers reported finding the virus in a majority of 101 patients
with chronic fatigue syndrome. The study's co-authors at the
Whittemore Peterson Institute for Neuro-Immune Disease, the National
Cancer Institute and the Cleveland Clinic, also found the virus in
nearly 4 percent of 218 healthy people used as controls in the study.
Extrapolating from those numbers, public-health officials estimated
that up to 10 million people in the US and hundreds of millions of
people globally could be infected with XMRV.

The apparent link to CFS, which affects an estimated 17 million
people worldwide, and has no specific treatments, has been closely
followed by the patient advocacy community. The Whittemore Peterson
institute, established by the family of a chronic fatigue patient,
has started collecting blood from CFS patients who got their
diagnosis following a blood transfusion and plan to launch their own
study of the issue, says Annette Whittemore, founder and president of
the institute.

The CFIDS [chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome]
Association of America, an advocacy group for chronic fatigue
syndrome, set up a bank to collect biospecimens to be used in
potential studies about CFS, including XMRV-related ones. Researchers
at Emory University and the University of Utah published a study last
week [1 Apr 2010] showing that XMRV may be treatable with drugs that
treat HIV. (see Singh IR, Gorzynski JE, Drobysheva D, Bassit
L, Schinazi RF, 2010 Raltegravir Is a Potent Inhibitor of XMRV, a
Virus Implicated in Prostate Cancer and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
PLoS ONE 5(4):
e9948.
<http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009948>).

The AABB [American Association of Blood Banks], an association of
facilities that collect virtually all of the US blood supply, has
also set up an XMRV task force, although the virus doesn't appear on
a list of infectious agents evaluated by a special AABB
transfusion-risk committee, as concerns came out after the latest
list was put together.

Labs in Europe reported earlier this year that they haven't been able
to replicate the XMRV findings in patients with chronic fatigue
syndrome or prostate cancer. And public-health experts say a key
issue in sorting out the disparate findings is to reach agreement on
tests that are sensitive and reliable in identifying XMRV in the blood.

The federal working group's project has 3 phases. 1st, labs at 6
participants -- including the FDA, the National Cancer Institute, the
CDC, and the Whittemore Peterson lab -- are using a panel of blood
samples to try to establish which of the labs' tests are sensitive
and reliable enough to find XMRV in the blood. Results are expected
in a few weeks.

In the 2nd phase, also launched, a panel of around 350 different
blood samples developed by Dr. Busch's team will be sent to four
different labs. Some of the samples are from chronic fatigue patients
known to have XMRV. Others from healthy donors have been spiked with
the virus or have tested negative. All the samples are blinded, and
the study will see whether the different labs can agree on XMRV
positive status for chronic fatigue patients.

A 3rd phase may be launched later, using frozen specimens in federal
repositories dating to the 1970s. These repositories link donors to
recipients and will allow researchers to see if XMRV was transferred
in transfusions and help determine prevalence in the past as well as
today, as well as geographical clusters or associations with age and gender.

"There is a balance to what we are doing," says Simone A Glynn,
branch chief of transfusion medicine and cellular therapies at the
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and chairperson of the XMRV
working group. "You do not want to transfuse an infectious agent that
causes problems. But you do not want to take blood out of the system
that is not causing any problems."

[Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) on account of
its similarity to murine leukemia virus is classified as a member of
the genus _Gammaretrovirus_, whereas human immunodeficiency virus is
classified in the genus _Lentivirus_. While the link between MLRV and
human disease, and chronic fatigue syndrome in particular, remains
controversial, it is certainly prudent to further refine diagnostic
procedures in order to determine the extent of the presence of XMRV
in the human blood supply and any correlation with human disease. The
outcome of the research in progress is a matter of general interest. - Mod.CP]
