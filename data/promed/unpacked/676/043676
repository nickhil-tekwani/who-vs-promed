Ireland's Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) reported 16 additional syphilis cases the week ending 25 Dec [2021], bringing the total cases to 792 with one week left to report. This total already towers above the 600 cases reported in all of 2020 by more than 30%.

The bulk of the cases were reported in the HSE [Health Service Executive] East area of Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow with 630, also up from 2020 when the area saw 474. The HSE South area of Kerry and Cork has seen the 2nd-most cases this year to date [25 Dec 2021] with 52.

A national outbreak was declared and has been under investigation in Ireland since June 2021. [See ProMED post Syphilis - Ireland: rising incidence, men, alert 20210712.8512672. - Mod.ML]

Syphilis is easily treated but highly infectious, and many people with the condition often don't develop symptoms. HSE Ireland says that if left untreated, syphilis can cause "serious health problems" to the heart, brain, eyes, and nervous system that could take years to develop. It can also pass from pregnant women to their children, potentially causing serious harm.

[In July 2021, ProMED posted a report that Ireland declared a national outbreak of early infectious syphilis, or EIS (that is, primary and secondary syphilis), when there were 242 cases in the 1st 4 months of 2021 (Syphilis - Ireland: rising incidence, men, alert 20210712.8512672). This occurred after a decrease in cases (600) in 2020 during the 1st year of the COVID-19 pandemic vs 782 cases in the prior year (2019). The decline in cases in 2020 was thought to be due to temporary closure of sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics and delays in reporting in 2020, as well as restrictions in social interactions during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 (https://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/rate-of-sexually-transmitted-infections-falls-amid-covid-19-pandemic-1.4267979). The total cases for 2021 is 792, as of 25 Dec, exceeding the total for 2019.

We are not told in the news report above characteristics of the affected population in 2021. In 2020, 92% of early infectious syphilis cases were males. Similarly, as of 4 Nov 2019, 94% of cases were males (85% of cases were in men who have sex with men (MSM), where known) (https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/sexuallytransmittedinfections/syphilis/surveillancereports/), and in 2018, 96% of cases were in males (86% of cases were in MSM, where known); 40% of EIS cases were co-infected with HIV, where known (https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/sexuallytransmittedinfections/syphilis/surveillancereports/Syphilis%20in%20Ireland,%202018%20(includes%20latest%20trends)%20v1.0.pdf).

More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
