AIRPORT MALARIA - AUSTRALIA (02)
================================

Here is a summary of the case reported in the 17 March 1997 issue of the
MJA [Medical Journal of Australia] by one of my colleagues:
Dr Grant Jenkin (one of the infectious diseases registrars with the
Victorian Infectious Diseases Service (VIDS), located at the
Royal Melbourne Hospital. The co-authors include Prof Graham Brown,
Head of VIDS, as well as two members from the Tropical Health Unit, Cairns,
Queensland: Scott Ritchie, medical entomologist and Jeffrey Hanna, public
health physician
This was a case of _Plasmodium vivax_ malaria.
The patient was a 24 year old male,
with no significant past history, no iv drug use and no transfusions.
He lived at Machans Beach, a small coastal suburb of Cairns, just
north (2 km) of the international airport terminal. He usually slept
in an open carport at his Cairns home, where he was often bitten by
mosquitoes.

He travelled to Melbourne, Victoria, and became ill four days after
arrival. He presented to a medical practitioner in Melbourne
in early October 1996, with a nine day history of fever, daily rigors,
generalised headache, left loin pain and dark urine. He was
jaundiced and had mild splenomegaly and tender hepatomegaly.

Malarial parasites were noted on examination of a routine blood film,
and thick and thin smears confirmed _P. vivax_ infection with 0.25% of
red blood cells containing parasites. He recovered after treatment
with chloroquine and primaquine.
The article then details the extensive investigations undertaken to
ensure that there were no other cases of unrecognised airport malaria
and that there were no primary or secondary cases. As part of this
investigation, a mosquito survey was performed with 6 CDC light traps
set (up) within 1 km of the patient's residence. Very few potential vectors
(adult _Anopheles farauti_ sensu lato mosquitos)were collected
(mean 3.3 per trap; range 0-6).

Even if a local mosquito had become infected by biting a
person with unidentified imported malaria, there were 4 consecutive
days in late September with minimum daily temperatures of 15 degrees Celsius
or lower. These temps. would probably have prolonged the sporogenic cycle
beyond the lifespan of the mosquito.
It was concluded that this patient did not introduce malaria for the
following reasons:
1) no possible imported case could be identified
2) there were very few potential vectors
3) environmental conditions were unsuitable for sporogeny within
these vectors.
The patient's home at the southern end of Machans Beach is downwind of
the south-easterly to south-south easterly winds that prevailed in early
October 1996. There also is a corridor of mangrove and melaleuca swamp
along the river banks between the airport and the home, which would
have provided the flying conditions preferred by Anopheles mosquitoes.
There are frequent flights into Cairns from malarious areas (e.g.
there were 15 flights from Papua New Guinea or Irian Jaya during the
six days of the patient's presumed incubation period).
All international flights entering Australia (except from New
Zealand) must undergo standard insect control procedures. Cabins are
sprayed with a 2% solution of permethrin both before passengers
board and 30 min. before landing. The cargo must be sprayed at the
last port of call before entering Australia or on arrival. Several
airlines (including QANTAS and Air Niugini) have the holds and/or
cabins sprayed with residual insecticides, which eliminates or
reduces the requirement for repeated insecticide spraying.
Australia was declared free of endemic malaria by the WHO in 1981.
This is believed to be the first recognised case of airport malaria
in Australia. The rarity of airport malaria attests to the relative
effectiveness of the above procedures. The authors concluded that compliance
with current quarantine guidelines is important and any potentially locally
acquired case must be thoroughly investigated to prevent re-emergence
of malaria in northern Australia.

[We are very happy to receive this authoritative and detailed explanation
of the case. We still wonder whether airport malaria is really that rare
-- in Australia & elsewhere -- or whether it is usually not suspected and
therefore, in contrast to this case, the diagnostic blood smears are not
done? - Mod.JW]
