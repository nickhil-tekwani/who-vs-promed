Twenty states and the District of Columbia have met President Joe Biden's 4 Jul 2021 goal of vaccinating 70% or more of adults with at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, according to tracking by the New York Times. Puerto Rico and Guam have also met the goal https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/07/01/world/covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-updates#the-us-wont-reach-bidens-july-4-vaccination-goal-but-20-states-are-already-there).

California, Illinois, and New York have all met the goal. Vermont remains the national leader in vaccination.

Fourteen states have vaccinated 60%-65% of adults, including Florida and Texas, and 16 states are below 60%. Mississippi has the lowest vaccination rate in the country, at 46%. Almost all states in the South are below 60%.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID Data Tracker shows that 382 283 990 COVID-19 vaccine doses have been delivered in the United States and 328 152 304 have been administered, with 155 884 601 Americans fully vaccinated (66.7% of adults have received at least one dose of vaccine; https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations).

The United States reported 14 463 new COVID-19 cases yesterday [1 Jul 2021] and 305 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker. The slight recent uptick in cases has largely been due to the circulating Delta (B1617.2) variant, which is highly transmissible and accounts for between 25% and 50% of cases in US communities (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases).

For the 2nd day in a row, Arkansas yesterday [1 Jul 2021] reported its biggest one-day spike in new COVID-19 cases in 4 months, with 700 new cases, the Associated Press reports. State officials are blaming the increase on the Delta variant (https://apnews.com/article/ar-state-wire-arkansas-coronavirus-pandemic-health-382e906a3b023a9721baf2839eb8a936).

Los Angeles County reported 506 new COVID-19 cases yesterday [1 Jul 2021], its highest single-day total since mid-April [2021], according to CNN (https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2021/07/01/la-county-reports-506-new-covid-19-cases-highest-number-since-mid-april/). Meanwhile, the San Francisco Chronicle reports that new infections have risen by 20% in the Bay Area since the state reopened on 15 Jun 2021 (https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/COVID-cases-up-more-than-20-in-Bay-Area-16288049.php).

In both California and Arkansas, officials say most new cases are in unvaccinated residents.

In promising news concerning the Delta variant, Johnson & Johnson (J&J) released data that showed its one-dose adenovirus-based vaccine was protective against the variant and provided immunity for at least 8 months in recipients.

The news comes as relief to the 11 million Americans who have received the J&J vaccine thus far. Once considered a pandemic game-changer by some, the vaccine quickly fell out of favor after it was linked to a handful of serious blood clotting events in April [2021]. More recently, people who had gotten J&J shared concerns that they would require a booster of an mRNA vaccine to protect against variants.

"Current data for the 8 months studied so far show that the single-shot Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine generates a strong neutralizing antibody response that does not wane; rather, we observe an improvement over time," said Mathai Mammen, MD, PhD, global head of research and development at Johnson & Johnson.

[2] Southeast Asia: surges accelerate

Health officials in Indonesia and Thailand reported record daily highs for new COVID-19 infections, much of it driven by the Delta (B1617.2) variant, as the leader of the World Health Organization (WHO) today [2 Jul 2021] said countries have 2 options for pushing back: public health measures and sharing tools such as medical supplies, oxygen, and vaccine.

At a briefing today [2 Jul 2021], WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said no country is out of the woods yet with COVID-19 and that the Delta variant is dangerous and continues to evolve. He called on world leaders to vaccinate at least 10% of their populations by the end of September [2021], which would protect health workers and those most at risk, tamping down the pandemic's acute phase.

"There is now some sharing of vaccines happening but it's still only a trickle, which is being outpaced by variants," Tedros said. "In those countries whose hospitals are filling up, they need vaccines and other health tools right now."

Global health officials have feared an explosive outbreak in Indonesia, the world's 4th most populous country. And...the country's cases yesterday [1 Jul 2021] soared to new record levels, with nearly 25 000 reported.

Health ministry officials told the UK-based Guardian that the Delta variant is now responsible for 60% of cases, and plans are in the works to triple the country's oxygen supplies by reallocating supplies from the commercial sector (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/02/indonesia-triple-oxygen-supplies-covid-19-outbreak-worsen-delta-variant).

Elsewhere, Thailand reported a record 6087 cases over the last day, along with a record 61 deaths, according to the Pattaya Mail (https://www.pattayamail.com/thailandnews/thailand-reports-new-records-of-daily-case-at-6087-and-death-toll-at-61-on-friday-362055).

More global headlines
- In the United Kingdom, the number of Delta variant infections rose 46% over the past week and currently account for 95% of sequenced cases, according to a weekly update from Public Health England. However, officials added that they're not seeing a rise in hospitalizations, which they said shows the benefit of vaccination (https://www.gov.uk/government/news/confirmed-cases-of-covid-19-variants-identified-in-uk).

- In other European developments, Portugal ordered night curfews for its COVID-19 hot spots, and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said in its weekly communicable disease update that so far 7 countries have reported about 2500 COVID cases linked to EURO 2020 soccer tournament travel and activities.

- Australia's New South Wales state reported 31 more cases in its latest outbreak, including 5 that don't appear to be linked to earlier cases, prompting discussions about extending the lockdown for the capital and surrounding areas, according to the Sydney Morning Herald (https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/nsw-covid-lockdown-could-be-extended-as-daily-cases-highest-in-12-months-20210702-p586cz.html). Federal officials announced that the country would halve its foreign arrivals, due to an overloaded quarantine hotel system, according to Reuters (https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-national-cabinet-meet-amid-covid-19-vaccine-turmoil-2021-07-01/).

- The global total today [2 Jul 2021] rose to 182 861 801 cases, and 3 958 947 people have died from their infections, according to the Johns Hopkins online dashboard (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html).

[3] SARS-CoV-2 evolution
Date: Fri 2 Jul 2021
Source: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) [abridged, edited]
https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/118/29/e2104241118.full.pdf


Citation: Rochman ND, Wolf YI, Faure G, et al. Ongoing global and regional adaptive evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Proc Natl Acad Sci. 2021; 118(29): e2104241118. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2104241118

Significance
Understanding the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is essential to control and ultimately end the pandemic. We analyzed more than 300 000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes available as of January 2021 and demonstrate adaptive evolution of the virus that affects, primarily, multiple sites in the spike and nucleocapsid protein. Selection appears to act on combinations of mutations in these and other SARS-CoV-2 genes. Evolution of the virus is accompanied by ongoing adaptive diversification within and between geographic regions. This diversification could substantially prolong the pandemic and the vaccination campaign, in which variant-specific vaccines are likely to be required.

Abstract
Understanding the trends in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) evolution is paramount to control the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed more than 300 000 high-quality genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 variants available as of January 2021. The results show that the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic is characterized primarily by purifying selection, but a small set of sites appear to evolve under positive selection. The receptor-binding domain of the spike protein and the region of the nucleocapsid protein associated with nuclear localization signals (NLS) are enriched with positively selected amino acid replacements.

These replacements form a strongly connected network of apparent epistatic interactions and are signatures of major partitions in the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny. Virus diversity within each geographic region has been steadily growing for the entirety of the pandemic, but analysis of the phylogenetic distances between pairs of regions reveals 4 distinct periods based on global partitioning of the tree and the emergence of key mutations. The initial period of rapid diversification into region-specific phylogenies that ended in February 2020 was followed by a major extinction event and global homogenization concomitant with the spread of D614G in the spike protein, ending in March 2020. The NLS-associated variants across multiple partitions rose to global prominence in March to July [2020], during a period of stasis in terms of interregional diversity. Finally, beginning in July 2020, multiple mutations, some of which have since been demonstrated to enable antibody evasion, began to emerge associated with ongoing regional diversification, which might be indicative of speciation.

Conclusions
Virus evolution during a pandemic is a fast-moving target, so that, unavoidably, aspects of this analysis will be outdated by the time of publication. Nevertheless, several trends revealed here appear general and robust. Although it is difficult to ascertain positive selection for individual sites, the overall adaptive character of SARS-CoV-2 evolution involving multiple amino acid replacements appears to be beyond reasonable doubt. As expected, there are multiple positively selected sites in the S protein, but, more surprisingly, N protein includes several sites that appear to be strongly selected as well. The involvement of these adaptive substitutions in the nuclear localization of the N protein appears likely. Importantly, some of the mutations, for which positive selection was inferred, cooccur on multiple occasions and seem to form a robust epistatic network. Most likely, the effect of positive selection is manifested primarily at the level of epistatic interactions.

Clearly, despite the dramatic reduction in global travel, the evolution of SARS-Cov-2 is partly shaped by globalizing factors, including the increased virus fitness conferred by S/D614G, N/R203K&G204R, and other positively selected amino acid substitutions. However, we obtained strong evidence of both continuous virus diversification within geographic regions and "speciation," that is, formation of stable, diverging, region-specific variants. This ongoing adaptive diversification could substantially prolong the pandemic and the vaccination campaign, in which variant-specific vaccines are likely to be required.

[Due to its relevance to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, PNAS is publishing this article without embargo: The findings are concerning -- "the overall adaptive character of SARS-CoV-2 evolution involving multiple amino acid replacements appears to be beyond reasonable doubt." Evidence was obtained for both "continuous virus diversification within geographic regions and 'speciation,' that is, formation of stable, diverging, region-specific variants."

It will be important to develop a vaccine that can protect against new variants that may be more fit and able to escape neutralization by existing antibody following vaccination or natural infection. How effective the current vaccines are against new variants remains to be seen. - Mod.LK]

[4] Gender disparity in economic recovery from pandemic
Date: Wed 30 Jun 2021
Source: National Geographic [edited]
https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/why-women-have-suffered-more-financially-during-the-pandemic


The disproportionate economic harm that the pandemic has done to women -- what some are calling the "shecession" -- seems to have taken many people by surprise. But longstanding inequities made women especially vulnerable.

The Gates Foundation released new findings today [30 Jun 2021] from the Eurasia Group and the International Labor Organization, in conjunction with UN Women's Generation Equality Forum, documenting why women across the globe were hardest hit and have been slowest to recover [see https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/articles/women-economic-impact-covid19 and https://forum.generationequality.org/].

"It's not just in the global north," says Anita Zaidi, president of the Gates Foundation's Gender Equality Division. "It's everywhere."

Unemployment increased for both men and women during the COVID-19 pandemic, but men's jobs are returning more quickly. One of the reasons is that women are more likely to work in industries disrupted by the pandemic and lockdowns.

Though a similar proportion of men and women lost their jobs during the pandemic, fewer women are getting rehired, according to the new data. There will likely be 13 million fewer women employed this year [2021] than there were in 2019. Women are on the frontlines in the fight against COVID-19 but few of them are in decision-making roles.

One major reason for that employment gap is that more women work in industries still reeling from shutdowns -- retail, tourism, hospitality, restaurants. Another is childcare: With schools and daycares closed, many women around the world had no option but to leave their jobs to care for their children. Before the pandemic, a quarter of women spent more than 9 hours a day caring for their children; now a third spend at least that amount of time.

"People think about a pandemic only from a health perspective," says Zaidi. "Nobody thought about, okay, what will the damage to education, schooling, childcare actually be?" The vision and priorities for life beyond the pandemic will stem in large part from who is in charge. COVID-19 taskforces have proliferated during the crisis -- there are 225 in 137 countries -- but women fill only a quarter of their seats. More broadly, while women make up 70% of healthcare workers, they account for just 25% of healthcare leaders.

That leaves large gaps in knowledge -- and in care that's foundational in many women's lives but didn't earn the official rating of essential. Women's health programs, such as contraception, were not considered essential services during lockdowns, says Zaidi. The result? Some 12 million women are estimated to have lost access to contraception, leading to 1.4 million unintended pregnancies.

The cumulative effects of lost jobs, unobtainable childcare, and unplanned pregnancies is increased poverty. Before the pandemic, global poverty rates were decreasing at the rate of 2.5%. This year [2021] poverty rates are estimated to increase by 9%.

But it is possible to reverse this trend, according to the new findings. Data from the Eurasia Group indicates that providing childcare to women would add USD 3 trillion of gross domestic product to the global economy (in terms of purchasing power parity), while cash transfer programs -- small amounts distributed to women earning less than USD 2 a day -- could lift as many as 100 million women out of poverty.

The Gates Foundation is pledging to donate USD 2.1 billion over the next 5 years toward women's economic empowerment, health and family planning, and leadership development. "Poverty is sexist," says Zaidi -- so solutions must take gender into account.

["COVID-19 has exacerbated existing gender inequities, with reports of rising violence against women, as well as higher adverse economic impacts caused both by increased unpaid care-giving and the fact that women work in more insecure, low-paid and informal jobs. Women of color, indigenous women and youth face compounded risks and barriers. We are living through a gender equality crisis, and the Generation Equality Forum offers a critical opportunity to confront it."

"Every sector of society -- governments, civil society, private sector, entrepreneurs, trade unions, artists, academia and social influencers -- [must] drive urgent action and accountability for gender equality."

"The Generation Equality Forum is a global gathering for gender equality convened by UN Women and co-hosted by the governments of Mexico and France, in partnership with youth and civil society. The Forum kicked off in Mexico City in March [2021] and [culminated in Paris from 30 Jun to 2 Jul 2021], launching a series of concrete, ambitious and transformative actions to achieve immediate and irreversible progress towards gender equality" (https://forum.generationequality.org/). - Mod.LK]
