Bluetongue in Yugoslavia
------------------------
see also: 30 Nov 2001, 2 Nov 2001 (previous outbreak of bluetongue in
Yugoslavia reported to the OIE: November 2001).
Extract from a monthly report of Yugoslavia for October 2002, received from
the Federal Minister of Economy and Domestic Trade, Belgrade:
Location / No. of outbreaks / No. of cases
Ub, Sabac / 1 / 8
Kosjeric, Kraljevo / 4 / 6
Priboj, Kraljevo / 4 / 11
The report also indicates that bluetongue was present in September 2002.
Note: no information for July and August 2002 has been received at the OIE
Headquarters.

[The first outbreak of Bluetongue (BT) in Yugoslavia was recorded in
September/October 2001; it involved 299 cases, reported from 16 locations
(see refs). As remarked by Peter Roeder in his November 2001 posting
(Bluetongue,upsurge - Mediterranean basin), the upsurge of BT has been
observed, since 1999, in 2 distinct extension areas within the
Mediterranean basin. One is an eastern epizootic, reportedly associated
with BT virus (BTV) serotype 9, which initially affected Turkey, mainland
Greece, and Bulgaria. The other was a western epizootic, which arose in
December 1999 and January 2000 in Tunisia, close to the Algerian border,
reportedly associated with BTV serotype 2. These were, as he remarked, the
first recordings of BT in mainland Greece, Bulgaria, and North Africa.
It would be interesting to obtain updated information on the BTV
serotype(s) that caused the 2002 outbreaks in Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Bosnia,
and Herzegovina (the latter 3 reported in September 2002). In the past,
other BTV serotypes -- such as 4 and 16 -- were recorded as well (Turkey
and Greece).
BTV has been spreading, since 1999, far beyond its previous northern
boundaries, which were determined mainly by the geographical distribution
of efficient BTV vectors (namely _Culicoides imicola_). The background to
this change has to be sought in climatic changes affecting the
vector-related ecology. Other, less efficient candidate species, such as
_Culicoides obsoletus_, have been identified in Greece, as mentioned in
Peter Roeder's posting. Data on the vector currently identified as
responsible for the described BTV dissemination is requested.
BT seems to demonstrate in the Balkan countries a seasonal occurrence,
which might be similar to the one seen in southern Mediterranean countries.
In Israel, where serological, virological, and entomological surveillance
has proceeded for several decades, BT occurs between July and December,
peaking in October/November and practically absent -- at least, as a
clinical entity -- during the first 6 months of the year. - Mod.AS]
