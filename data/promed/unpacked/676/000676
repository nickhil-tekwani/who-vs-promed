Canada: 2nd Person Tests Positive for Avian Influenza A (H7N3) Virus
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A 2nd farm worker in the Fraser Valley has been diagnosed with avian
influenza virus infection by the British Columbia Centre for Disease
Control (BCCDC). BCCDC spokesperson Dr. Danuta Skowronksi says it is a
worker whom health officials had previously identified with mild illness in
connection with the outbreak.
"It is really just today that we've had the lab information," she says. "It
confirms that it's H7 type influenza virus." [It is presumed that this
virus is H7N3 type, but the neuraminidase antigenic specificity does not
seem to have been confirmed as yet. - Mod.CP]
She says both infected workers are now fully recovered from mild influenza
symptoms. Dr. Skowronski says up to 12 people who came in close contact
with infected birds have shown signs of the H7 strain infection and that
the BCCDC is still waiting for more test results. While [avian influenza A
(H7) virus] is not considered a serious threat to human health, Skowronski
says she wants the outbreak stopped as soon as possible, because of the
possibility of genetic mutation.

2nd Poultry Worker Has Contracted Avian Influenza Virus Infection
--------------------------------------------------
A 2nd worker who handled diseased chicken carcasses has become infected
with the avian influenza virus, the British Columbia Centre for Disease
Control confirmed on Thu 1 Apr 2004. The worker had mild respiratory
problems and an eye infection, but recovered completely last week after
being placed in quarantine when the symptoms first occurred. Blood tests
confirmed he had been infected with the avian influenza virus. Another
worker last week became the first human case in Canada after he also
developed symptoms. Both workers recovered completely. Dr. Danuta
Skowronski, an infectious diseases specialist at the centre, said the 2
workers picked up the infection in separate incidents. "There is no
evidence of person-to-person spread. They had separate exposure,"
Skowronski said.
Humans contracting avian influenza after coming into close contact with
infected birds is not uncommon. In the Netherlands during 2003, 80 poultry
and agricultural workers contracted avian influenza A (H7N7) virus, and one
veterinarian died of pneumonia after becoming infected with the avian virus.
In total, 12 workers who were outfitted with gloves, goggles, and
protective gear for their feet and hands, have picked up cold-like symptoms
since working in the Matsqui "hot zone" area where the Canadian Food
Inspection Agency is overseeing the slaughter of 365 000 chickens following
the discovery of avian influenza in late February 2004. The Province's
public health officer, Dr. Perry Kendall, is recommending anyone working
with infected chickens take an anti-viral drug and get vaccinated against
human influenza.
The 2 workers who have been confirmed infected had neither taken the
anti-viral drug nor received a vaccination.
On Thursday, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency reported that avian
influenza has spread deeper and farther than previously thought. Just as
preparations were being made to slaughter the birds on 3 small family-run
operations in the hot zone, workers found avian influenza had infected the
flock. The agency made the unprecedented decision to kill all 365 000 birds
within the hot zone after positively identifying avian influenza virus in 6
larger commercial operations within the zone.
Cornelius Kiley, the regional veterinarian for the agency, said on Thursday
that avian influenza had been confirmed on a 7th farm, in an area outside
the hot zone. The farm is within a controlled zone in the Fraser Valley,
where poultry and poultry products are restricted from leaving. An 8th
farm, also in the Fraser Valley but not near the 7th farm, may also have
avian influenza, he said.
Both farms are now under quarantine as the agency decides whether to expand
the hot zone. Kiley said tests that confirmed the presence of avian
influenza on the 7th farm have not yet determined whether it is the same
strain that hit the hot zone. The industry is undecided about whether to
press for an expansion of the hot zone, said Lisa Bishop, spokeswoman for
the Chicken Farmers of Canada. "It's too soon to say one way or another.
It's clear that something is happening, but we don't know whether it's a
spread or a new development," she said Thursday.
"It may be travelling some other way and it may be a brand new outbreak
with a brand new migratory bird." The possible expansion of the hot zone is
heightening concerns about how quickly the industry can recover. Importing
areas such as the European Union are asking for infected exporting
countries to be pathogen-free for 6 months before shipping out poultry.
Bishop said the industry had hoped that by pressing for a controlled zone
like that in the Fraser Valley, other regions of the province and the rest
of Canada would have some protection and still be allowed to export.
Poultry producers will meet today with federal Agriculture Minister Bob
Speller to outline their concerns.
