Uganda's ministry of health on [Thu 24 May 2018] announced an outbreak of measles, one of the country's top killer diseases.

Jane Ruth Aceng, minister for health, told Xinhua that the measles outbreak has been reported in 29 districts in the east African country. She said children are the most affected.

Aceng said the ministry plans to carry out an emergency measles immunization exercise in the affected districts targeting children below 5 years. She said the move is to avert the spread of the disease.

The health authorities blamed the low level of immunization for the outbreak of the disease.

"Some districts have coverage ranging between 70-85 percent. That is not good enough. That is why we continue to experience these outbreaks," said Aceng.

"We need to increase the coverage to above 95 percent so that we shall see no cases of measles," she said. ...
