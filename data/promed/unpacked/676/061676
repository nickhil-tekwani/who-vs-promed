The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Catholic Medical Center (CMC), and the Manchester Health Department (MHD) announce that the test results on a patient who was treated at CMC and who was believed to have had Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) have come back positive from the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center. The test results were reported to DHHS and CMC earlier today [20 Sep 2013].

Earlier this month [September 2013], CMC notified 8 neurosurgery patients who may have been exposed to CJD through neurosurgical equipment because the prion that causes sporadic CJD is not eradicated by the standard sterilization process mandated at hospitals. 5 other patients in Massachusetts and Connecticut were also potentially exposed.

*****The general public and any other patients at CMC and their employees are not at any risk.

CJD is a rare and fatal disease that affects the nervous system and causes deterioration of the brain. It affects about one in a million people each year worldwide. In the United States, only about 200 people are diagnosed with CJD each year. "Though we are not surprised by the test results," said Dr. Jose Montero, Director of Public Health at DHHS, "we are saddened by the toll this disease takes on families, and our sympathies go out to all those affected."

"Our focus and concern continue to be with the patients who may have been exposed to CJD," said Dr. Joseph Pepe, M.D., President and CEO of CMC. "This afternoon [20 Sep 2013], we have reached out to our 8 patients to let them know about the autopsy results. We let them know we will continue to help and support them and to monitor their health going forward even though the risk is extremely low that any of these patients was infected."

[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is caused when proteinaceous particles called prions attack the brain, leading to mental deterioration and, ultimately, death. It can be transmitted via contaminated surgical equipment (iatrogenic CJD). Classical CJD can be either sporadic (of unknown origin), inherited (familial), or variant CJD (vCJD), believed to have originated from the prion responsible for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and transmitted to humans through consumption of contaminated meat. The CJD identified in the patient(s) undergoing surgery in the New Hampshire hospital ranks as iatrogenic CJD.

A total of 13 patients in New Hampshire hospitals are believed to be at risk of developing Creutzfelt-Jacob (CJD) disease following surgery with instruments previously used in treatment of a patient with suspected CJD [now confirmed by the detection of the CJD prion]. It is well established that procedures appropriate for sterilisation of instruments for normal surgical procedures are not sufficient to inactivate prions, and instruments potentially used in the surgical treatment of CJD patients should be withdrawn from use, unless exceptional sterilisation facilities are available. The probability of the potentially exposed patients in New Hampshire developing CJD cannot be predicted at this stage. Hopefully, the risk will remain no more than theoretical. - Mod.CP
