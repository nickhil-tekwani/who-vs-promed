Here is another answer to Dr. Wilde's question regarding a rapid test
for leptospirosis.
To our knowledge no simple diagnostic test for veterinary purposes is
available which also is suitable for use as a human diagnostic. Some
ELISA systems for veterinary purpose exist but they would need
adaptation with special conjugates, and these cannot be considered
as simple tests.
We recently have developed a rapid dipstick test for the
serodiagnosis of human leptospirosis (Gussenhoven et al., J. Clin.
Microbiol 35; 1997, 92-97). The test is simply performed by
incubation of a dipstick in a mixture of serum and detection reagent.
At the end of the incubation the dipstick is rinsed with tapwater and
the result can be viewed directly with the naked eye. The
applicabilty has been demonstrated in two multicentre studies
involving over 30 different laboratories on all countinents. In total
more than 3000 serum samples were tested in these studies revealing a
sensitivity and specificity of well over 90%. The sensitivity
depends though on the stage of the disease and is lower during the
first 5-7 days after the onset of the disease).
Dr. George Watt, Department of Retrovirology, AFRIMS, Bangkok,
Thailand, Phone: 66-2 6446735 will have some experience using the
test. The test is available from:
Dr. P. Dessing,
Organon Teknika b.v.,
Boseind 15, P.O.
Boxtel, 5280 A!B Boxtel,
The Netherlands
Phone:31-(0)411-654036, Fax 31 (0)411-654057,
E-Mail <p.dessing@teknika.btl.akzonobel.nl>
I am convinced that you will find the test useful. If you need any
other information regarding this test please do not hesitate to
contact me. We also are working on an ELISA system suitable for
veterinary purposes but this tests is not yet available.
Other tests for leptospirosis are commercially available from:
MRL Diagnostics, & ELISA systems from Panbio. However, I do not
have any experience with any of these tests.
Finally, contrary to the opinion of Dr. Wilde that leptospirosis is
episodic in Thailand and should pose no threat to tourists, I would like
to mention that we have had several cases of tourists who contracted
leptospirosis while traveling in tropical countries including Thailand.
For this I refer to the paper by Crevel et al. "Leptospirosis in
travelers" published in Clin. Inf. Dis, 19, 1994, 132-134.
