More than 50,000 volunteers flocked Wednesday to the Honduran capital
[Tegucigalpas to take part in a large-scale effort to contain a growing
dengue fever epidemic.
Students, teachers, workers, entrepreneurs and government officials swarmed
into areas of the city hardest hit by the outbreak to pick up garbage and
debris and mop up puddles where the mosquitoes that transmit the disease
breed.
Five thousand cases of dengue fever were recorded as of Wednesday in
Honduras. Another 618 were reported Tuesday in Costa Rica, where the areas
most affected were the Puntarenas and Golfito regions on the country's
Pacific coast.
[Dengue hemorrhagic fever = DHF, a more dangerous [manifestation of the
disease was diagnosed in 18 of the Costa Rican victims.

[If any or all of the 50,000 volunteers flocking to the epidemic area have
not had dengue, they soon will. This could be an unprecedented experiment.
