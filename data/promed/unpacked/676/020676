The Ministry of Health (MoH) in Saudi Arabia has announced one additional laboratory-confirmed case and 2 deaths in previously confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in Saudi Arabia.

The new case is a 56-year-old female from Hafr Al-Batin city, North-eastern region. She is a health care worker with contact with a previously reported laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV case who subsequently recovered and was discharged.

In addition, the 2 deaths in previously confirmed cases are a 53-year-old citizen from the Eastern Region and a 2 year-old male from Jeddah.

Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 80 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 44 deaths.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travelers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. Specimens from patients' lower respiratory tracts should be obtained for diagnosis where possible. Clinicians are reminded that MERS-CoV infection should be considered even with atypical signs and symptoms, such as diarrhea, in patients who are immunocompromised.

Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers and visitors.

All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

WHO continues to closely monitor the situation.

[The above report is the WHO global total of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including the additional case in a female healthcare worker reported on the Saudi MOH website on 6 Jul 2013, and 2 additional deaths in previously reported cases (see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (38): Saudi Arabia, WHO, RFI 20130706.1810505). The global case count is now at 80 laboratory confirmed cases including 44 deaths.

According to the Saudi MOH website on coronavirus, there have now been 65 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV identified in Saudi Arabia including 38 deaths.

[2] Studies underway

This week, experts from around the world will begin meeting to advise the World Health Organization on the new MERS coronavirus.

One of the key reasons the so-called emergency committee is being called together at this point, a senior WHO official says, is because so many questions remain unanswered about the virus that causes Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome. "There's a whole lot of information which we don't understand," Dr. Keiji Fukuda, assistant director general for health security and the environment, says of the WHO's unexpected move, announced Friday [5 Jul 2013]. MERS doesn't yet have pandemic potential, but the future of the virus is unknown. Saudi Arabia has reported 2 more deaths from MERS coronavirus.

Efforts to find the source of the MERS virus and to answer basic questions about the way it moves into and among people have been frustratingly slow to yield results.

A decade ago, when the SARS virus emerged, developments moved much more rapidly. Within 2.5 months of the new disease hitting the world's radar, scientists in Hong Kong had found the SARS coronavirus in civet cats, which are eaten as a delicacy in the part of southern China where SARS emerged.

More than a year after the MERS virus was 1st isolated [September 2012, see ProMED-mail post Novel coronavirus - Saudi Arabia: human isolate 20120920.1302733 for original report of virus identification], the world still has no idea how this new coronavirus is finding its way into human lungs in several Middle Eastern countries, most notably Saudi Arabia.

But there is renewed hope that the work of a renowned U.S. research team may begin to pay dividends. The scientists, from the Center for Infection and Immunity in the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, hope to soon be able to begin testing animal samples imported from Saudi Arabia.

It's believed the new MERS virus originated in bats but is probably infecting people via some animal or animals that serve as a bridge.

Getting the samples into the United States has been a lengthy endeavour, says centre director Dr. Ian Lipkin, who is famed at finding new viruses. That's because of U.S. rules designed to keep the country free of the foot and mouth disease virus, a highly contagious and economically devastating pathogen that infects hoofed animals. Saudi Arabia has foot and mouth disease, so technically, specimens that might contain the virus cannot be brought into the United States. Lipkin says it has taken months to devise a work-around, but one has been approved. "And it's gone all the way up, frankly, to the White House. Very complicated, very difficult. A major impediment to getting an answer," he says.

All Saudi samples destined for Lipkin's lab that are from ungulates -- hoofed mammals such as goats, camels, and sheep -- will be pre-tested for foot and mouth disease virus at the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal Disease Center on Plum Island, off the tip of Long Island, N.Y. If samples are found to be free of the virus, they will be released to Lipkin's laboratory, where scientists will be able to begin studying them to look for MERS or MERS-like viruses, or for antibodies to the virus. These specimens may arrive in the U.S. this week, Lipkin says. "And then we'll get into gear doing the molecular and serological assays."

Lipkin says he doesn't know how many animal samples there will be in the shipment or how many types of animals have been sampled. The specimens were taken during his team's 2nd trip to Saudi Arabia, in April [2013].

A previous shipment of bat samples that were collected during a trip his team made last October [2012] contained what he felt was a highly promising lead.

A small trace of virus taken from an insect-eating bat looked to be a match for the MERS virus. But the samples in the shipment arrived in poor condition, essentially ruined.

"So we had a lead. We tracked the lead. Unfortunately, we don't have enough material to be absolutely confident of the finding. That is what it is, and I can't pretend it's anything else," Lipkin says.

Asked if he feels any closer to finding the source of the virus, he admits to frustration. "What I want to do is to go in with a large team and collect thousands of bats across the country and do this in a rigorous, concerted, thorough and definitive fashion. That's what I really want to do," Lipkin says. "Right now, I'm jumping here; I'm jumping there; I'm capturing what I can. And it's not ideal."

To do that, though, he needs resources. Much of the work to date has been unfunded. "Are people concerned about MERS? Or are they not concerned about MERS? There's no big push at this point," he notes.

In addition to the research aimed at identifying the virus's reservoir, Lipkin's team is trying to help answer another key MERS question: Are there mild or symptom-free cases that are evading detection?

Most diseases have a spectrum of illness, with severe cases making up the tip of the iceberg. So far with MERS, only the tip has been visible. More than half of known cases have died. But there have been a few mild cases spotted, giving experts hope there may be more that aren't being picked up by existing surveillance systems, which are set up to look for the virus in people who are critically ill.

One way to answer this question is by looking for antibodies in the blood of people who may have been exposed to the virus. Antibodies are proof of prior infection. Lipkin's laboratory has been testing blood samples from more than 200 individuals from Saudi Arabia. Some of the samples were taken from known cases, others from contacts of cases.

The team doesn't know which is which, but they've studied the samples using a variety of assays and have reported the results to the Saudi deputy health minister, Dr. Ziad Memish. Memish has the code which outlines the source of each sample. Comparing the lab's results to Memish's master list should start to give a clearer picture of whether the infection is more common than has been seen to date.

"I don't know which samples are people who had active disease, which people recovered from disease, which people were contacts," he says. "And until I have the code cracked, I can't really be certain of what we've learned."

Lipkin says results of this study will be submitted for publication in a journal.

[This newswire provides some additional background information on the studies under way with respect to further understanding MERS-CoV, both in terms of possible identification of an animal source of the virus as well as background serologic studies of the population to see whether there is more widespread, subclinical infection. The scientific community is looking forward to seeing the planned publication of these study results, with hopes that these studies will further the understanding of MERS-CoV infections.

Information on the outcome/recommendations of the WHO IHR Emergency Committee meeting scheduled for 8 Jul 2013 is also awaited and will be posted when available.
