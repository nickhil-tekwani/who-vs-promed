Researchers have discovered a new virus in patients in Viet Nam suffering from severe brain infections, a team of scientists reported today [18 Jun 2013] in mBio, the journal of the American Society for Microbiology. The virus was detected in 28 of 644 patients who had severe brain infections and none of 122 patients who had non-infectious brain disorders, according to researchers at the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, Wellcome Trust South East Asia Major Overseas Programme and the Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam. It's tentatively called CyCV-VN and is part of a group of viruses known as Circoviridae known to circulate in animals such as birds and pigs, they said.

"We don't yet know whether this virus is responsible for causing the serious brain infections we see in these patients, but finding an infectious agent like this in a normally sterile environment like the fluid around the brain is extremely important," Rogier van Doorn, head of emerging infections at the Wellcome Trust Viet Nam Research Programme and Oxford University Clinical Research Unit Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Viet Nam, said in a statement.

Brain infections can be fatal and may leave people who survive them with severe disabilities, the researchers said. Bacteria, parasites, fungi and viruses can cause the infections, though doctors can't pinpoint the cause of more than half of them. The study was funded by the Wellcome Trust, the European Union and the Li Ka-Shing Foundation-University of Oxford Global Health Programme.

[Circoviruses are unenveloped single-stranded DNA viruses with ambisense encoding of their genome content. They are widespread and predominantly infect avian species. The authors of the mBio paper, referred to above, detected a novel circovirus in spinal fluid from 4 percent of 642 patients with central nervous system infections of unknown cause and in an average of 58 percent of fecal samples from pigs and poultry, suggesting animals may serve as reservoirs for transmission to humans. The virus, named CyCV-VN, belongs to the _Cyclovirus_ genus, a group that has never before been implicated in human disease.

"The detection of CyCV-VN in a usually sterile material like cerebrospinal fluid is unexpected and may indicate a pathogenic role of this virus as a single or a co-infecting pathogen," according to the authors at the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam. The results in this study, the authors caution, do not provide absolute proof of disease causation, and further work is needed to determine whether this virus poses a threat to human health.

According to the authors, acute central nervous system infections are responsible for illnesses and deaths around the world, but they are a particular problem in tropical regions. These infections can be caused by any of a number of bacterial, parasitic, fungal or viral pathogens, but the majority of cases go undiagnosed despite extensive efforts to identify a cause. "One of our particular interests is to improve patient diagnosis," said Van. "Proper diagnosis is essential to improve clinical management and prevention of these devastating diseases."

Inspired by the high incidence of acute central nervous system infections in Viet Nam, the authors set out to identify previously uncharacterized viruses in undiagnosed patients. Using fluid samples from more than 1700 patients with suspected central nervous system infections or suspected viral encephalitis, the researchers generated 161 000 DNA sequence reads for further analysis. Among these thousands of sequences, the researchers identified a sequence from a virus belonging to the _Cyclovirus_ genus that was present in 2 patients, one adult and one child, both with acute central nervous system infections of unknown cause. Subsequent determination of the entire genome sequence of the virus present in one of the samples established that the virus (named CyCV-VN) is a unique new species of the genus _Cyclovirus_, a group that includes no known pathogens.

Having determined the complete genome sequence, the researchers went back to 642 samples from patients with suspected acute central nervous system infections and were able to detect the virus in samples from 26 patients (4 percent). The virus was not detected at all in samples from patients with non-infectious conditions of the central nervous system, such as multiple sclerosis, a fact that argues that the virus could well be a human pathogen.

This virus was also detected in samples from farm animals in the province where the index patient lived: between 42 percent and 100 percent of fecal samples from pigs, ducks, and chickens in that region harbored viruses that are extremely closely related to CyCV-VN. This suggests that livestock could represent a source for human infection with the virus.

Van also cautions that it is too soon to point an accusing finger at CyCV-VN. "Detection of a virus in human samples alone is insufficient to provide a direct link with an ongoing infection, and the question of causation requires extensive effort."

The authors are currently trying to isolate the virus in cell culture and develop a serological assay. If they are able to identify an antibody response to the virus in patient samples, they would be one step closer to linking the virus to disease. They are also working with research groups outside Viet Nam to explore the geographic spread of the virus.
