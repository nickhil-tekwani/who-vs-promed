[The differential diagnosis of bluetongue in sheep includes several diseases, among which contagious ecthyma (orf) is ranked high. During the early stages of orf in sheep and goats, oedema of the muzzle may precede the appearance of the typical proliferative lesions. This may, at times, lead to confusion with bluetongue. As indicated in ProMED-mail's commentary to Georgia's immediate notification, this is particularly relevant for events involving juveniles (lambs), hence requiring confirmation from a reference laboratory (see the commentary in archive no. 20160126.3966527).

Contagious ecthyma (orf) is a highly contagious, zoonotic, parapoxvirus skin infection, affecting sheep, goats, and some other domesticated and wild ruminants. The skin lesions are painful and often occur on the mouth and muzzle; hence the other names of the disease, contagious pustular dermatitis, sore mouth, and scabby mouth. The lesions are of a proliferative nature. Lesions on the udder may result in the abandonment of offspring, and (less commonly), foot lesions can cause transient lameness. Secondary bacterial infections can occur, and, in rare cases, the lesions may extend to other external parts of the animal and into the internal organs. Progression to generalized disease is considered rare but events accompanied by high mortalities occur occasionally. Usually, fatality rates are below 10 percent. This is a very common infection of sheep and goats, present in all sheep and/or goat raising countries, globally. In most countries, it is not a reportable disease or a cause for movement restrictions; it is not included in the international (OIE) lists of reportable diseases.

Humans are usually infected by direct contact with animal lesions, for example, children in petting zoos/parks, usually by letting infected lambs lick their fingers. It is not transmitted by consumption of meat or milk, direct contact with lesions being the common infection route. Most infections in humans are localized and heal spontaneously; however, large, poorly healing lesions can occur in people who are immunosuppressed.
