Since November 1997 there [has not been a single case of local
transmission of dengue in Cuba, up to 23 Oct 1999. All cases are imported
from Central America and Haiti. We have increased the active surveillance
of febrile cases in places in the Province in which we have imported cases
and the vector is present. For that reason rumors of dengue transmission
have circulated in the population, but we can confirm that all dengue cases
are imported up to this moment.

[We are grateful to Gustavo for this correction. ProMED is always in an
awkward position when we receive reports of any disease outbreak, anywhere,
from any but an "official" source. The problem is that "official" sources
sometimes are slow to report because they are thorough in their
investigations. We posted the report on dengue in Cuba because it appeared
to be from a reputable source and a later, official, Cuban report indicated
there were cases of dengue in Cuba; we had held the unofficial message
until we received the more formal news. The official report mixed
hepatitis and dengue cases, so it was not clear as to what was what, but it
appeared to confirm the unofficial report. Apparently, it did not.
As our readers might recognize, there are people who would like to amplify
out of realistic proportions any health problems in Cuba. These are
politically motivated, of course.
Henceforth, when I receive on unofficial report of a disease occurrence in
Cuba, I will check first with Cuban authorities for confirmation. Denial
will not necessarily mean we will not post it anyway, but we should be able
to obtain at least a preliminary indication.
The bottom line is that Gustavo Kouri says that all current dengue cases in
Cuba are imported. That is good enough for me. - Mod.CHC
