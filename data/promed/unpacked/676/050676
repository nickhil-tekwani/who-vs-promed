A strangles outbreak has forced a show centre in Staffordshire to cancel all competitions.

Kingswood Equestrian, near Wolverhampton, which hosts affiliated and unaffiliated dressage and show jumping competitions, will remain closed for shows until at least the end of the month [April 2014].

Strangles, a bacterial infection of the equine lymph gland, which results in a restriction of the horse's airway, is highly infectious, spreading through direct contact with infected mucus.

"We have 6 horses which are categorized as being in the red group, and they are completely isolated," owner Robert Lickley told H&H. "We are confident that the outbreak doesn't pose any risk to the show centre because it is a couple of hundred of metres away. However, we thought it was better to be up front, and we wanted to do the right thing."

There are more than 30 horses based at Kingswood, but Rob is satisfied that the outbreak is now contained. As well as isolating different groups of horses, the center has used a thermal fogging disinfectant machine to make sure that it has a "clean area."

[Strangles, a disease entity known worldwide, caused by bacterial infection with _Streptococcus equi_ subspecies _equi_ (referred to as _S. equi_), is not included in OIE's list of notifiable diseases. - Mod.AS]

[Strangles is caused by bacterial infection with _Streptococcus equi_ subspecies _equi_ (referred to as _S. equi_). The bacteria typically infect the upper airway and lymph nodes of the head and neck. The disease has been in the equine population for centuries and was 1st reported in 1251. The infection is highly contagious in horse populations, particularly affecting young horses, and can recur on farms with previous outbreaks of the disease.

Though strangles is highly contagious and can affect many horses on a farm, most horses with infection recover without complication. Complications from the infection include spread of the infection to lymph nodes other than the head and neck (also known as metastatic infection or bastard strangles), immune mediated disease (such as purpura hemorrhagica), muscle disease and pain, and lack of milk production. Horses that develop complicated infections typically require antibiotic and additional therapies based on veterinary examination.

The hallmark clinical signs of infection are fever (temperature over 101.5 F [38.6 C]), nasal discharge, and enlarged submandibular lymph nodes (in the space between the lower jaw bones), which ultimately abscess. Purulent nasal discharge is typically present, although it may initially be clear. The retropharyngeal lymph nodes (located deep behind the throatlatch) may also become enlarged and abscess. These will sometimes drain into the guttural pouches, which are air-filled spaces within the head that are an expansion of the Eustachian tubes. Guttural pouch infection and pus accumulation (empyema) are often the result of retropharyngeal lymph nodes that abscess and rupture into the guttural pouches. Guttural pouch infection may also occur from bacterial entrance through the pharynx (throat). Anorexia, depression, and difficulty swallowing may also accompany signs of infection.

Nasal discharge from the infected horse is the largest source of contamination. Sources of infection can be nose to nose contact with an infected horse, sharing contaminated water buckets, feed tubs, twitches, tack and clothing and equipment of handlers who work with infected horses.

Once the horse comes into contact with a potential source of infection, it may take 3-14 days after exposure before the horse will show the 1st clinical sign of strangles (fever). Based on this information, a minimum isolation period for introduction of new horses to the farm should be 14 days.

Clinical signs of strangles are highly suggestive of the diagnosis. There are 3 methods to confirm the diagnosis of strangles:

- Culture of the bacteria from the nasal discharge or abscess;
- Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that detects DNA of the _S. equi_ bacteria;
- Blood test (serology) that measures a titer to a specific protein (SeM) of _S. equi_.

Antibiotic therapy remains controversial for the treatment of strangles. Complicated cases and those requiring tracheostomy for management of respiratory distress generally do require antibiotic and other supportive therapies. There is some evidence that treatment with antibiotics (such as penicillin) at the 1st sign of fever and in horses with no lymph node enlargement may prevent infection. However, early antibiotic treatment will also prevent these cases from developing immunity to the infection, and subsequently makes them susceptible to re-infection sooner.

Vaccination is one method for prevention and control of infection with _S. equi_. However, vaccination cannot guarantee disease prevention. With strangles, vaccination will likely reduce the severity of disease in the majority of horses that are infected. Available vaccines can be administered by intramuscular and intranasal routes. Improper administration of the vaccination can result in poor protection against infection and/or complications at the site of injection; therefore, administration by your veterinarian is recommended. The intranasal vaccination results in the best local immunity. Vaccination is generally not recommended during an outbreak of strangles.

When an outbreak or potential outbreak occurs, it is important to work with your veterinarian. Strangles is a reportable disease in some states. Isolation of the affected animal or animals is important. Other measures to take include taking the temperature of all horses on the farm at least twice daily. Normal rectal temperature is 99-102 F [37-38.8 C]. Monitoring the rectal temperature and isolating horses at the 1st sign of fever is one of the most effective ways to stop the spread of infection. Infected horses can transmit the bacteria to healthy horses 1-2 days after they develop a fever.

Unexposed horses should be kept in a "clean" area and ideally should have separate caretakers, cleaning equipment, grooming equipment, water troughs and pasture. People and equipment can transfer the infection from horse to horse. Extreme care, hand washing, and disinfection of supplies must be observed by everyone involved. If different individuals cannot care for infected and healthy horses, then healthy horses should always be dealt with 1st.
