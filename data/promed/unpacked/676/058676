Gorkha farmers clearing orange groves
-------------------------------------
Farmers of [Gorkha District, Western Region] are clearing their orange groves following consistent drop in orange production. [Farmers] said orange trees were drying [off] due to [an] unidentified disease.

Many farmers are felling orange trees following [an] outbreak of the disease which is turning their orange trees dry. [They] say orange trees are drying up fast [and] yield smaller and fewer fruits.

[The] District Agriculture Office said they do not have sufficient funds and manpower to treat all orange trees. "Last year [2014], we had provided treatment in groves spread over 50 hectares [124 acres]. We have funds to treat only 20 hectares [50 acres] this year," they added.

[Numerous undiagnosed diseases of citrus are being reported from the region. It is not clear which specific problem is reported here, what treatment was provided previously, and whether it improved the situation. While disease management for most citrus pathogens includes clean planting stock and elimination of pathogen reservoirs, conclusive diagnosis of the pathogen(s) involved is needed to design effective management strategies.

It is thought that combinations of various pathogens may have contributed to the general decline of citrus health in the region due to accumulation of parasitic pathogens in old orchards over time. Extensive harvest failures have led to citrus replanting programmes (ProMED-mail post 20080130.0375), but these will only be of long term benefit if linked to an ongoing crop sanitation and monitoring programme to prevent re-introduction of pathogens, especially into orchards used as sources for propagating material.
