Human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus - China
----------------------------------------------------------
On [14 Apr 2017], the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China (NHFPC) notified WHO of 15 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in mainland China.

Details of the cases
--------------------
Onset dates ranged from [27 Mar to 11 Apr 2017]. Of these 15 cases, 3 were female. The median age is 58 years old (age range among the cases is 39 to 81 years old). The cases were reported from Anhui (1), Beijing (1), Gansu (1), Henan (2), Hunan (1), Shandong (2), Sichuan (3), Tianjin (1), Tibet (2), and Zhejiang (1).

This is the 1st time a human case with avian influenza A(H7N9) has been reported from Gansu Province and the 1st time a human case with avian influenza A(H7N9) has been reported in the 5th epidemic wave in Tianjin (previously 2 cases were reported to WHO in July 2016).

At the time of notification, of the 11 cases with information on the condition of the case, there were 2 deaths, 8 cases were diagnosed as having either pneumonia (1) or severe pneumonia (7), and 1 case was mild. A total of 12 cases were reported to have had exposure to poultry or live poultry market and 1 case had exposure to live poultry sold by street vendors or the environment near the street vendor which might have been contaminated by avian influenza A(H7N9) virus. At the time of notification, there was no information available regarding poultry exposure for 2 cases.

One cluster was reported and includes:
- A 39-year-old male from Lhasa, Tibet Autonomous Region. He had symptom onset on [28 Mar 2017] and was admitted to hospital on [1 Apr 2017]. He had severe pneumonia and was still in hospital until [18 Apr 2017]. He worked at a live poultry market and was involved in the slaughter and selling of live poultry.

- A 41-year-old male from Lhasa, Tibet Autonomous Region who was notified to WHO on [8 Apr 2017]. He had symptom onset on [27 Mar 2017] and was admitted to hospital on [1 Apr 2017]. At the time of the report he had severe pneumonia and he was still in hospital until [18 Apr 2017]. He worked at the same live poultry stall as the 39-year-old male. He was also involved in the laughter and selling of live poultry.

To date [Thu 20 Apr 2017], a total of 1393 laboratory-confirmed human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported through IHR notification since early 2013.

Public health response
----------------------
Considering the increase in the number of human cases since December 2016, the Chinese government at national and local levels is taking further measures which include:
- continuing to strengthen control measures with a focus on hygienic management of live poultry markets and cross-regional transportation;
- requesting all provinces to stay vigilant and fully implement control and preventive measures. Providing guidance to epidemic areas on strengthening control and prevention;
- conducting public risk communication and information publicity to provide the public with guidance on self-protection;
- strengthening trace-back investigations and etiology surveillance to define the scope of virus contamination and mutations, in order to provide further guidance for prevention and control.

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
The number of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) in the 5th epidemic wave (that is, onset since [1 Oct 2016]) is greater than the numbers of human cases reported in earlier waves.

Human infections with the avian influenza A(H7N9) virus remain unusual. Close observation of the epidemiological situation and further characterization of the most recent human viruses are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner.

Most human cases are exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, and live poultry vending continues, further human cases can be expected. Although small clusters of cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported including those involving patients in the same ward, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore the likelihood of further community level spread is considered low.

WHO advice
----------
WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid, if possible, poultry farms, contact with animals in live poultry markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water, and follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling in or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.

WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR 2005, and continue national health preparedness actions.

[6] Pandemic potential of influenza A/H7N9
Date: Fri 21 Apr 2017
Source: The Washington Times [edited]

House Republicans sounded the alarm [Fri 21 Apr 2017] over an avian flu threat that's escalating in China, saying it underscores the need to finish and vet an overdue plan for responding to pandemic flu at home.

The H7N9 avian influenza virus mainly affects people who've been exposed to live poultry. It's infected nearly 1000 people in Asia and had a 40 percent fatality rate since its discovery in 2013, though the latest spurt of cases has been worse than previous ones, according to the World Health Organization.

Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden, Oregon Republican, and Rep. Tim Murphy, Pennsylvania Republican, say it is more important than ever to have a solid response plan in case the virus or other types of pandemic flu reach the US.

Last year [2016], the Obama administration told Congress it was updating a decade-old plan to incorporate lessons from the US's brush with the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. The Health and Human Services Department told lawmakers it would release the document before the end of last year [2016], but there's still no plan.

"The need for the updated Pandemic Influenza Plan is vital as there is a current potential pandemic threat," Mr Walden and Mr Murphy said in a letter to HHS Secretary Tom Price. They cited an expert who said that H7N9 poses the largest pandemic threat in the last 100 years, raising the specter of yet another global health scare after recent outbreaks of Ebola in West Africa and the mosquito-borne Zika virus in the Americas.

WHO, the public health arm of the UN, is closely monitoring the situation in China, where government officials recently reported 15 new cases in 9 [10] separate provinces [as of 20 Apr 2017; see [5] above].

Of the 11 cases with enough information on outcomes, 2 of the people had died, 1 had pneumonia and 7 had severe pneumonia, while 1 case was considered mild. Of the 15 infected people, 12 had been exposed to live poultry, and 1 was exposed to live poultry sold by street vendors. It's unclear if the remaining 2 were exposed to the virus-carrying animals.

All told, WHO says 1393 lab-confirmed cases have been reported since its discovery 4 years ago [2013]. The organization said the latest spurt, which began in October [2016] and marks the 5th epidemic "wave" of H7N9, is the worst one so far.

"The H7N9 virus is an extremely important threat and its continued spread in China is very worrisome as the number of human cases has been accelerating and its ability to cause severe disease in bird species seems to have increased," said Dr Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior associate at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. "Though human cases are not widespread, when they occur they can be very severe and fatalities occur."

WHO advised travelers to countries with H7N9 to avoid poultry farm and markets. The virus hasn't shown the ability to transmit from human to human over a sustained period, though clusters of cases have been reported among patients housed in the same hospital ward.

"Avian viruses have to evolve adaptations to the human body to become efficient at spreading between humans," Dr Adalja said. "It will be important to study the human cases in detail to track any changes in the virus and to be on alert for heightened human transmission risks."

[Since 2013, there have been nearly 1400 human cases of influenza A/H7N9. There are an accelerated number of human cases and more severe disease has been observed in the affected birds. All these factors are cause for concern that the virus may be undergoing evolutionary changes enabling it to become more pathogenic in birds or easily transmissible among humans. Intense yet coordinated surveillance in both the animal and human sectors is needed. - Mod.UBA]
