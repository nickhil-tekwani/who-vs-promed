Cholera - Africa

Nelspruit - Threats of a cholera outbreak in Secunda, Mpumalanga, have
abated after no more cases were reported after a 16-year-old boy was
hospitalised with the disease two weeks ago. Member of the province's
Epidemic Task Force, Dr. David Durrheim, said on Tuesday that tests on
sewerage effluent, local streams and suspicious diarrhoea cases had failed
to detect any new cases. "Although, as a precautionary measure, high-level
surveillance will be continued until the end of the month," he said.
The boy, from Embalenhle, has since been discharged from hospital where he
was treated for severe dehydration. His parents were also treated for
milder symptoms of cholera and diarrhoea and his whole family quarantined.
The incident immediately saw a local rapid response team set up in
cooperation with the Secunda and Embalenhle councils, the local health
department and various large industries. Previous cholera alerts were
issued for the Shongwe region on Mpumalanga's borders with Mozambique and
Swaziland after cholera was detected in the Lomati River in November last
year. Twelve people were infected during that incident.
Cholera has meanwhile killed over 113 Mozambicans in the cities of Maputo,
Beira and Quelimane over the past month, with 3,249 additional cases of
chronic cholera diagnosed in just February. Mozambique's national health
director, Avertino Barreto, said a total of 36,425 people have been
diagnosed with the disease since September.
The epidemic has also sparked violent attacks against health workers in
Mozambique's northern provinces of Nampula and Cabo Delgado where rural
villagers believe health officials are purposely contaminating their wells
by chlorinating them. Potentially contaminated water should be chlorinated
or boiled for domestic use. Water can be chlorinated with one capful of
domestic bleach for every 20-litres of water. The resulting mixture must be
left to stand for at least four hours before use. Water that is boiled must
also be brought to a continuous boil for at least three minutes before use.
Anyone suffering from profuse watery diarrhoea should immediately
rehydrate themselves by drinking a solution of one litre of clean water
with eight teaspoons of sugar and one half a teaspoon of salt. The
solution should be well shaken before being drunk. All suspected cholera
victims should be immediately referred to the nearest clinic or hospital
for further medical treatment after drinking the solution. When buying
from street vendors, eat only foods that can be peeled or shelled.

Cholera has occurred seasonally in the country for a number of years.
Outbreaks usually start in late November/early December and end around May.
In the first week of December 1998, cholera was reported in Mogadishu
(Benadir region) and since then several regions have reported cases. The
other regions currently affected are Bay, Gedo, Lower Juba and Lower
Shabelle. A total of 4 457 cases with 166 deaths has been reported since
December up to 19 February. The epidemic is occurring in communities
already weakened by severe shortage of food and in areas where only
polluted water is available as wells have dried up. Supplies for treatment
have been made available by WHO to UNICEF. United Nations agencies, NGOs
and local health authorities are collaborating in dealing with the
epidemic. Efforts have been directed towards clinical case management, as
well as preventive measures such as chlorination of public water sources
and health education on personal hygiene. At present, tests for cholera can
be conducted in 4 laboratories (Marka in Lower Shabelle, Mogadishu in
Benadir, Bosasso in Bari and Hargeisa in Galbeed). As it is difficult to
predict how long this epidemic will last or how much it will spread, the
supplies that have been made available may be exhausted and there may well
be a need for more, and consequently for the support of the international
community.

Nairobi (The Nation, March 26, 1999) - Food kiosks were closed down on
Wednesday as the campaign to curb the spread of cholera intensifies.
Mombasa Municipal Council askaris and health officials targeted kiosks
which defied a government order to close down all food outlets following
the cholera outbreak, which has claimed more than 20 lives. Last Wednesday,
District Commissioner Wilfred ole Legei warned that anyone violating the
ban imposed on food kiosks would be prosecuted.
Town Hall has already given a one-month notice to all kiosk operators to
move out of the town centre so that contractors could start rehabilitating
the roads. Last weekend the askaris stormed various kiosks in the town and
its environs, ordering them their to close down. Among the structures
affected were those at Uhuru Gardens on Moi Avenue and those near Kenya
Broadcasting Corporation and Customs and Excise Department offices. The
demolition left more than 1,500 people jobless and property of unknown
value damaged.
Yesterday the kiosk operators claimed they were not given any notice by the
council to close down their premises. "The council has not written to us
about closing down our premises, so their move to come and take away our
food and forcefully close our kiosks is unfair," said one of the kiosk
operators. However, an official at the council said they had been given the
notification but defied it.
