The Public Health Agency of Canada is collaborating with federal and provincial public health partners to investigate an outbreak of hepatitis A infections in 3 provinces linked to the frozen fruit product: Nature's Touch Organic Berry Cherry Blend. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has issued a food recall warning advising Canadians of the recall of the frozen fruit product that has been distributed in Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador.

The Public Health Agency of Canada advises Canadians not to consume the frozen fruit product Nature's Touch Organic Berry Cherry Blend sold exclusively at Costco warehouse locations in Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador. If you suspect you have been exposed to the recalled product, or have symptoms consistent for hepatitis A, see your health care provider immediately. Vaccination can prevent the onset of symptoms if given within 2 weeks of exposure.

The overall risk to Canadians is low. Hepatitis A is a disease that can cause inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis A can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a severe illness lasting several months. You can get the Hepatitis A virus by eating contaminated food or water or through contact with an infected person's stool. Adequate vaccination can protect against the Hepatitis A virus.

Investigation Summary
---------------------
Currently, there are 12 cases of hepatitis A in 3 provinces, related to this outbreak: Ontario (9), Quebec (2), and Newfoundland and Labrador (1). Individuals became sick in February and March of 2016. Some of the individuals who became ill have reported eating the recalled product. The majority of cases (58%) are male, with an average age of 37 years. A total of 3 cases have been hospitalized.

Who is most at risk?
--------------------
Hepatitis A infections can occur among people of all ages; however, symptoms are likely to be more severe among the elderly and people with weakened immune systems.

What you should do to protect your health?
------------------------------------------
If you have Nature's Touch Organic Berry Cherry Blend frozen fruit in your home, do not eat this product. For more information on this product including stores that these products were sold at, please read the recall notice.

If you are unsure whether a frozen fruit product you have in your home is part of the food recall warning, do not consume it. Secure the product in a plastic bag, throw it out and wash your hands with warm soapy water.

The Government of Canada will continue to update Canadians if new information related to this investigation becomes available
