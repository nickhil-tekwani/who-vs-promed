A horse in Madison County [New York] has died from the eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEE).

Health officials said the horse was stabled in the Town of Lenox -- which is outside the area known to harbor the virus.

Horses are vulnerable to EEE, but there is a vaccine available to protect horses from it.

County health officials said an infected horse cannot pass the virus to other animals or people.

According to the New York State Department of Health, EEE is spread by mosquitoes and can affect people and horses.

The Oneida County [New York] Health Department reports its 1st confirmed case of Eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] this year [2014].

The department says a horse in the town of Trenton was euthanized 8 Sep 2014 after suffering neurological signs associated with EEE.

Tests have confirmed the horse was infected with EEE.

The infected horse was found outside the area in Oneida County routinely monitored by the county.

The health department reports it routinely tests mosquito pools in the western part of Oneida County, and so far this season has not detected any evidence of the disease.

Phyllis D. Ellis, Director of Health, says, "This horse was infected with the EEE virus in a portion of Oneida County where EEE has not been detected previously. In the past, EEE has never been detected further east than the western-most boundaries of the City of Rome [Oneida County]."

Ellis reminds residents to take steps to protect themselves from mosquito bites while outdoors, including:
- Use an insect repellent containing DEET.
- Wear long sleeves and pants covering as much skin as possible.
- Eliminate breeding sites around your home by removing "standing water" such as wading pools, bird baths, buckets, etc.
- Limit outdoor activity during times when mosquitoes are most active at dusk and dawn.

[Sadly, it would appear in both of these cases that the animal was not vaccinated. Vaccination is effective, simple and cheap compared to the loss of the animal. Every horse owner is encouraged to vaccinate their animal. The vaccination is usually combined with West Nile virus vaccination. It is given twice, 3 weeks apart. A single revaccination should be given every 4-6 months in areas prone to the virus.

The virus is transmitted from mosquitoes to horses or humans. Horses cannot transmit the virus to people.
