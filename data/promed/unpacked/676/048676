Dear Dr Blancou
Newcastle Disease in New South Wales
Further to my reports of 21 and 25 September, I wish to provide the
following additional information.
Slaughter-out of all poultry has been completed on the three infected
farms, as of 28 September 1998, and disinfection arrangements are in
place. All three farms remain under strict quarantine. Tracing has been
completed and there are no remaining dangerous contact premises.
No further infected properties have been identified. Extensive active
surveillance in the restricted and control areas has resulted in more
than 100 poultry farms being visited and almost 10,000 blood and swab
samples collected (all negative to date). Almost 100 samples collected
from wild birds around the three infected farms have also been negative.
Passive surveillance with the assistance of an organised network of
private poultry veterinarians is also in place.
Based on the surveillance results, the initial conservatively large
restricted and control areas were revised on 6 October. There has been
a reduction in the restricted area to a 3 km radius surrounding each
infected farm, and a contraction in the control area to an area of
approximately 10 km radius. The actual boundaries of the control area
are largely defined by local government areas (please refer to attached
maps). Movement controls outside of the revised control areas have been
lifted.
Surveillance has confirmed that the disease has been effectively
regionalised according to the principles established by OIE. Therefore
no restrictions have been placed on the movement of poultry or poultry
products within Australia, except from the surveillance zone around the
infected farms, ie the rest of Australia should be recognised as a
virulent Newcastle Disease-free zone. I shall keep you informed of
further developments.
Yours sincerely

Date of Notification
21 September, 25 September, 8 October 1998
Name of Disease
Newcastle Disease
Nature of Diagnosis
* Serological tests
* Isolation of a Newcastle Disease virus
* Immunohistology
* Chorio-allantoic membrane (CAM) antigen localisation test
* Gene sequence studies
* Determination of intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI).
Date of initial detection
16 September 1998
Estimated Date of first infection
1 August 1998 (provisional)
Number of separate outbreaks
Three
Geographical identification
Farms 1 and 2: 33*440' south, 151*0' east, near Sydney, NSW.
Farm 3: 32*58' south, 149*0' east, near Sydney, NSW.
Details concerning the outbreak
Farm No. Species No. of animals
1 Avian 76 000 layers
9000 pullets
10 geese
Ratites 4 ostrich
wild pigeons (unknown number)
2. Avian 12 000 layers
3. Avian 2 500 broilers
Comments concerning affected population
* These farms supply eggs and meat to the domestic market in the
Sydney metropolitan area
* No birds, poultry or products have been exported from these
properties
Comments on the epidemiology
Mortalities were first investigated on the 6 August 1998. The disease
picture on this farm was confused due to the fact that there was active
Marek's disease also present. The first evidence of Newcastle Disease
virus was test results from sera collected on 26 August 1998, which was
tested retrospectively when Newcastle Disease was included in the
differential diagnoses on 10 September 1998.
Pathological examination shows lesions consistent with a neurotrophic
virus. ICPI for the virus from infected farm 1 was 1.6, and from
infected farm 2 was 1.9.
Gene sequencing studies are continuing, but results indicate that the
NDV isolates from the three infected farms are the same virus.
Laboratory investigations are continuing but comparative studies against
other Australian lentogenic isolates and some overseas strains in the
genebank suggest that the outbreak strain may have evolved as a mutation
from an endemic strain.
Extensive active surveillance in the restricted and control areas has
resulted in more than 100 poultry farms being visited and almost 10,000
blood and swab samples collected (all negative to date). Almost 100
samples collected from wild birds around the three infected farms have
also been negative. Passive surveillance with the assistance of an
organised network of private poultry veterinarians is also in place.
There is no evidence of infection elsewhere in Australia.
Control measures taken to date
* The first two farms were officially placed in quarantine on 17
and 18th September 1998 respectively, and poultry were destroyed by 28
September. The third farm at Rylstone, was placed in quarantine on 22
September and poultry destroyed on 24 September.
* A surveillance zone has been imposed around the infected zones.
* A comprehensive surveillance program has been instituted.
* Disinfection arrangements are in place for the three farms.
