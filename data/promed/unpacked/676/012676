It has been confirmed that a dog has contracted lungworm in Plymouth.

A veterinary centre has confirmed that the parasitic worm, which is potentially fatal to canines if left undiagnosed, was picked up by vets at Elm Veterinary Group.

Posting on Facebook, the veterinary centre on Outland Road said: "We have had a confirmed case of lungworm there at Elm; please click on the link below to become lungworm aware."

Slugs and snails carry the lungworm larvae, and dogs can become infected when they eat these common garden pests accidentally or deliberately whilst rummaging through undergrowth, eating grass, drinking from puddles or outdoor water bowls, or pick them up from their toys, the Plymouth Herald reports.

The lungworm _Angiostrongylus vasorum_ is now endemic throughout much of the UK.

According to the website Act Against Lungworm, the PL [Plymouth] postcode currently has 9 reported cases of the parasite. The TR [Truro, Cornwall] postcode area has 19 registered cases.

Dogs of all ages and breeds can become infected, but younger dogs seem to be more prone to picking up the parasite, and dogs who are known to eat slugs and snails are also considered at high risk.

Some dogs don't initially show visible signs of a lungworm infection, but there are a few things to look out for, including breathing problems, poor blood clotting, general sickness, and changes in behaviour.

If you are concerned, your veterinary surgeon can perform tests which may help detect whether your dog is infected with the lungworm parasite.

The lungworm (_Angiostrongylus vasorum_) is not known to infect humans. However, dogs and cats can carry roundworms, which can cause diseases in people.

Cats can become infected with another type of lungworm (_Aelurostrongylus abstrusus_). If you are worried that your cat may be showing symptoms similar to those described for dogs (particularly coughing), speak to your vet for advice.

[_Angiostrongylus vasorum_, also known as French heartworm, is a metastrongylid nematode parasite that resides in the pulmonary arteries and right ventricle of dogs and other canids. The presence of the parasite has been reported in Europe, Africa, South America, and Canada. It is widely assumed that foxes act as a reservoir of infection for dogs.

Although clinical signs in association with _A. vasorum_ infection in dogs can be variable, they typically represent 3 main syndromes: cardiorespiratory signs, coagulopathies, and neurological dysfunction. The disease is increasingly diagnosed in dogs, as the geographic range of the parasite increases along with awareness among clinicians. Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are not always straightforward, although recent developments offer hope for improved options in future. Understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis remains poor.

Clinician awareness is an important defense against this disease, which can be severe and difficult to diagnose definitively. Although the pathogenesis is not fully understood, and current tests for parasitological diagnosis suffer from poor sensitivity, signs associated with infection are well described and should alert clinicians to the possibility of infection. Climatic models suggest that there is substantial scope for further geographical spread, so practitioners in areas not currently considered endemic should be vigilant. There are effective drugs for the treatment of _A. vasorum_, and early anthelmintic [anti-parasite] therapy of uncomplicated respiratory cases of mild or moderate severity has excellent prognosis for full recovery. More severe or unusual presentations, including bleeding disorders, can present a greater challenge. Regular anthelmintic treatment is likely to reduce, but might not eliminate, the risk of disease.
