10 cases of measles have been recorded in the Nizhnevartovsk Region [Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug]. All diagnoses have been supported by laboratory tests. None of the patients had been vaccinated. According to local physicians, unfortunately some members of the population were resistant to measures designed to improve their own health and those of other members of the population. In addition, every parent should know that attendance of their children at school is not permitted during the entire quarantine period. The source of the disease may be another sick person during the period of incubation of the disease (about 3-4 days before the rash appears), and during the 1st 5 days after the onset of rash. The incubation period lasts about 10 days, but can vary up to 17 days.

Symptoms of measles virus infection are:
- Body temperature rises to 38-39 deg C [100.4-102 deg F]. This is accompanied by a runny nose, dry cough, lacrimation and photophobia. This period is called catarrhal; it has a duration of 3 to 5.6 days. By its end temperature is slightly lowered and kept within 37.5-38 deg C [about 99.5-100.4 deg F].
- A day or 2 before the rash, small whitish spots on the buccal mucosa may appear; sometimes arranged in clusters around small molars. These spots are present for 2-3 days, and are a common symptom [sign] of measles.
- This is followed by the appearance of a rash when the temperature rises back to 40 deg C [104 deg F], before falling again after 5-7 days.
- In some cases, complications (such as laryngitis) may develop subsequently, often accompanied by inflammation of the lungs or purulent inflammation of the middle ear.

In Russia, measles vaccination is conducted in accordance with the National Immunization Schedule in 18 months. Adults aged 18-35 years are not vaccinated. Those without a history of prior measles virus infection, and with no prior documentary evidence of vaccination, are inoculated twice with an interval of at least 3 months between treatments.

Measles -- April-June 2014
--------------------------
16 measles infections with onset dates in the April to June 2014 quarter were confirmed in England compared to 70 cases in the 1st quarter of the year [2014]. 7 of the confirmed infections were identified in London with 4 cases reported from West Midlands, 3 cases the South East and one case each from Eastern and East Midlands regions. Across the UK, Scotland reported one case linked to recent travel to Viet Nam but there were no measles cases reported from Wales or Northern Ireland.

7 of the 16 English cases in the period reported a history of recent travel; 5 cases to the Far East (China and Viet Nam) one each to Malawi and United Arab Emirates. Measles virus sequence was obtained from 11 out of the 16 English cases and the single Scottish case which either confirmed the importation of infection or suggested links to an importation. 7 cases this quarter were in children aged 1 to 4 years and the remaining 9 cases were adults aged 20 to 64 years. Only one case reported previously receiving a measles-containing vaccine.

In the 12-month period July 2013 to June 2014, countries within the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) reported a total of 7116 cases. More than 3/4ths of the cases were reported from 3 countries; the Netherlands 34.4 percent, Italy 30.7 percent and Germany 12.2 percent. The previously reported outbreak in the Hague in the Netherlands is now over, but new outbreaks have been reported recently in Sweden and Belgium. Several outbreaks in EU Member States have a serological and epidemiological link to the large ongoing outbreak in the Philippines with 47 000 cases. Significant nosocomial transmission occurred in the 3 recent measles outbreaks reported from the Czech Republic, Latvia and Spain, demonstrating the continued presence of susceptible healthcare workers in EU Member States.

3 students at a Melbourne [Victoria] primary school have measles. Another 2 pupils at Essendon North Primary School may also have the infectious disease.

The students visited a number of local places while they were infectious but not displaying symptoms, prompting a health alert for people in the Essendon area from Victoria's chief health officer Dr Rosemary Lester. "All 5 pupils have not been immunised, further strengthening the importance of parents and guardians ensuring their children are vaccinated against highly infectious diseases such as measles," Dr Lester said on Wednesday [20 Aug 2014].

Students, staff, volunteers and visitors who aren't immunised aren't being allowed into the school for their protection.

Whitsunday [Queensland] residents are urged to contact their local health services in regards to a measles outbreak that was announced today [22 Aug 2014] from Mackay Hospital and Health Service. It has been reported that an adult male visiting from overseas has had contact with extended family, friends and in the community while infected. Mackay Hospital and Health Service Public Health Physician Doctor Stephen Donohue said a large number of people at a Whitsundays resort for a wedding have been exposed.

A measles alert has been issued for people who were visiting Montes Reef Resort at Hydeaway Bay on Friday, 15 Aug 2014, Cape Gloucester Beach Resort Hydeaway Bay on Friday, 15 Aug 2014 and Saturday, 16 Aug 2014 and La Tabella Trattoria on Airlie Beach Esplanade on Sunday, 17 Aug 2014. Anyone who also visited the following Mackay locations this week should also be warned: One Stop Centre on Tuesday, 19 Aug 2014 and MIMS Clinic Mackay Mater Hospital on Wednesday, 20 Aug 2014.

GPs and hospitals have been notified of the possibility of measles cases presenting. Measles is a highly infectious and serious viral infection that causes fever, cough, runny nose, sore eyes, and then a red spotty rash a few days later. It is often a severe disease and occasionally measles has dangerous complications.

Queensland Health recommends anyone born during or since 1966, who has not had 2 documented doses of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine or had proven measles, should visit their local GP to get vaccinated for measles.

[The Whitsunday group of islands lie off the northeast Queensland coast. These islands attract a large number of tourists throughout the year, and outbreaks of measles virus infection are frequent and not a seasonal phenomenon similar to the seasonal occurrence in the northern and southern hemispheres. Visitors to these resorts should ensure that their vaccination record is appropriate. - Mod.CP]

Cases of measles in the Solomon Islands continue to rise with over 200 reported, the majority of which are in Honiara [Honiara Province]. Parents need to act quickly and vaccinate their children aged 6 months to 4 years and 11 months against this potentially deadly disease, warns the Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MHMS), World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF. "Parents need to protect their children from measles. The best way of doing this is by taking them to a local health clinic for a measles vaccination. The vaccine is safe, effective and free. It will prevent their children from 'catching' the disease," said Dr. Lester Ross, Permanent Secretary of MHMS. "Even if a child has had one dose of the measles vaccine, parents of 1 year to 4 years and 11-month-old children should take them back to their health clinic for a 2nd dose, immediately," added Dr. Ross. "It is also important that parents remember to take their child's baby book so that they can keep a record of their child's vaccinations," concluded Dr. Ross. There is no treatment for measles, only medication to relieve the symptoms. MHMS, WHO and UNICEF are working together to control the measles outbreak in Solomon Islands.

[Solomon Islands is sovereign country consisting of a large number of islands in Oceania lying to the east of Papua New Guinea and northwest of Vanuatu and covering a land area of 28 400 sq km [about 11 000 sq miles]. The country's capital, Honiara, is located on the island of Guadalcanal. Solomon Islands should not be confused with the Solomon Islands archipelago, which is a collection of Melanesian islands that includes Solomon Islands and Bougainville Island. The population of Solomon Islands was approximately 523 000 in 2009, so the current measles outbreak is a serious event. - Mod.CP
