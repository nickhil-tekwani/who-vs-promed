In a follow-up on the salmonellosis outbreak in the Jyvaskyla region of Finland, the City of Jyvaskyla said imported lettuce served in daycare centres has been confirmed as the source of an outbreak of _Salmonella_ bacterial infections that affected about 450 children and daycare centre staff.

The salad contained domestic cucumber, peas, and foreign iceberg lettuce. Domestically produced cucumbers and peas were also suspected to be the cause of the outbreak, but the city said tests had revealed no connection between these products and the _Salmonella_ infections.

The most likely source of _Salmonella_ is iceberg lettuce, which came to Finland from Germany via Sweden. Samples taken from workers at the city's food supplier, Kylan kattaus, which prepares the meals for daycare centers in the region, have also proved to be negative for traces of _Salmonella_ bacteria.

Iceberg lettuce is a product that is not available domestically all year round, and on this scale not Finnish all the time. Such mistakes can occur both at home and abroad. There are responsible suppliers in both. Yes, this will certainly trigger an evaluation discussion on whether there is a need to change practices, says Kylan kattaus director Tuija Sinisalo.

[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for submitting this follow-up. The serotype of _Salmonella enterica_ has not been reported, but authorities have epidemiologically linked imported iceberg lettuce as the potential vehicle for transmission. It is not clear where in the chain from farm to table that the implicated vehicle for _Salmonella_ was contaminated. - Mod.LL
