Chronic wasting disease found in white-tailed deer in Virginia
--------------------------------------------------------------
The Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries (VDGIF) received
laboratory confirmation on 19 Jan 2010, that a white-tailed deer (WTD) had
tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD). This is the 1st
confirmed case of CWD in Virginia. The deer was killed by a hunter in
Frederick County less than one mile from the West Virginia line. With this
case, Virginia now joins 17 other states and Canadian provinces with CWD, 5
of which are east of the Mississippi River.

"This was not unexpected," stated VDGIF executive director Bob Duncan. "Our
wildlife professionals have been preparing for this for some time. The
surveillance efforts have been critical and we appreciate the hunters,
check station operators, and other cooperators who have supported our efforts."

CWD is a disease of deer and has not been found to be transmitted to humans
or other animals. To learn more about CWD in Virginia and about the
agency's CWD Response Plan visit <http://www.dgif.virginia.gov/cwd>.

This is the 1st positive test sample out of nearly 5000 deer tested in the
Commonwealth since 2001. VDGIF has been sampling hunter-killed and
road-killed deer from the Active Surveillance Area in western Frederick and
Shenandoah counties since 2005, when CWD was 1st detected near Slanesville,
West Virginia, within 10 miles of the state line. Between 2005 and 2009,
CWD has been detected in 62 deer in Hampshire County, West Virginia, out of
nearly 10 000 total deer sampled during that time. Several have been found
within 5 miles of the Virginia line.

Agency officials from West Virginia Division of Natural Resources (WVDNR)
and VDGIF continue to share information and coordinate their responses. For
more information on CWD in West Virginia please see the WVDNR website at
<http://www.wvdnr.org/>. VDGIF is also working in consultation with the US
Department of Agriculture and the Virginia Department of Agriculture and
Consumer Services.

[Chronic wasting disease is a member of the transmissible spongiform
encephalopathy family and is one of the few found in North America. It is
believed to be caused by a prion, not a virus , bacterium, or virion. The
exact mechanism of action may be undefined. There are many worthwhile
research papers on the subject. This is a neurological disease that causes
the animal to become thin, weak, stagger, stumble, and eventually die.
Diagnosis is confirmed through testing a portion of the brain stem.

While most white-tailed deer have a home range of about 1 to 1.5 miles in
diameter, they can stray farther and easily cross state boundaries. - Mod.TG
