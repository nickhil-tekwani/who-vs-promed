[1] ECDC updates
Date: Tue 5 Jul 2011

Update since 1 Jul 2011
-----------------------
In the EU/EEA, 892 HUS [hemolytic uremic syndrome] cases, including
32 deaths, and 3281 non-HUS cases, including 17 deaths, have so far
been reported.

Since the last update, Germany reports no additional HUS case, 48
additional non-HUS STEC [Shiga toxin producing _Escherichia coli_]
cases. 24 EHEC [enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_] and 2 HUS cases fell ill
within the last 10 days (22 Jun-1 Jul 2011). The last known date of
illness onset in a patient with confirmed EHEC O104 was 26 Jun 2011.
The last reported date of illness onset among all cases (also without
O104 confirmation) was 27 Jun 2011.

Update since 4 Jul 2011
-----------------------
In the EU/EEA, 897 HUS cases, including 33 deaths, and 3314 non-HUS
cases, including 17 deaths, have so far been reported.

Since the last update, Germany reports 6 additional HUS cases and 1
new HUS fatality, as well as 33 additional non-HUS STEC cases. 3 HUS
cases and 11 non-HUS STEC cases fell ill within the last 10 days (25
Jun-4 Jul 2011). The last known date of illness onset in a patient
with confirmed STEC O104 was 26 Jun 2011. The last reported date of
illness onset among all cases (also without O104 confirmation) was 29
Jun 2011.

With regards to the outbreak in France (Bordeaux Region), 8 cases of
bloody diarrhea and a further 7 HUS cases have been identified as of 2
Jul 2011. Infection with _E. coli_ O104:H4 has been confirmed for 6
patients with HUS. 11 of the patients had attended an event in Begles:
7 women and 4 men, between 31 and 64 years of age. 10 of these 11
reported having eaten sprouts. One previously identified case of HUS,
who had no link to the event in Begles, has been removed from our
counts, as she tested positive for _E. coli_ serogroup O145 and not
for O104.

Thorough investigations are ongoing. Strains from 3 patients tested
by the French authorities were compared to strains from patients
linked to the outbreak in Germany. The comparison showed that the 2
strains were indistinguishable. This suggests that these 2 events are
related to a common source.

Total cases: 4211 with 49 deaths -- 1.16 per cent case fatality
rate.

The cases do not necessarily reflect date of onset of disease but
rather when the diagnosis was made and reported. The number of newly
reported cases per day clearly decreased from the corresponding day in
the previous week. - Mod.LL]

[2] Egyptian fenugreek seeds in Sweden
Date: Mon 4 Jul 2011

A consignment of fenugreek seeds, from the batch believed to be the
source of the EHEC infection in Germany and France, has been tracked
to Sweden, according to the Swedish National Food Administration.

The seeds have been recalled but 25 kilos have already arrived in
Sweden. The National Food Administration has contacted the company
Econova in Norrkoping, who in their turn have stopped the sales and
recalled already delivered bags of seeds.

"Common denominators between the outbreaks in France and Germany have
been compared and authorities have been able to track it back to this
product," said Lars Plym Forshell from the Food Administration to TT
[The Local]. According to Plym Forshell the seeds originated in Egypt
and this consignment is believed to have arrived in Sweden as early as
in January 2010.

Fenugreek is largely used in curry mixes and products from the
suspected consignment have been sold to stores all over the country.
But wholesaler Econova hasn't learned of any customers falling sick so
far despite 6277 bags having been sold during 2011.

[As of yet, there is no "smoking" fenugreek seed, that is, the
outbreak strain has not been directly isolated from the seeds exported
by Egypt which epidemiologically seem to be the vehicle for
transmission. - Mod.LL]

[3] CIDRAP follow up
Date: Fri 1 Jul 2011

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [ECDC] has
deleted the name of a German seed importer from a risk assessment
report on the recent cluster of _E. coli_ cases in France, out of
concern about potential unnecessary harm to the company, CIDRAP News
learned today, 1 Jul 2011.

The original report published 29 Jun 2011 stated that AGA SAAT GMBH
of Dusseldorf, Germany, supplied seeds to a British firm (previously
identified as Thompson & Morgan) that sold the seeds used to grow the
sprouts linked to the _E. coli_ cases in Bordeaux, France. The company
was named in a 29 Jun 2011 CIDRAP News story based on the report,
which was published by the ECDC and the European Food Safety Authority
[EFSA].

But the name of the German firm was removed from the online ECDC
report a few hours after it was first published, CIDRAP News has
learned. The current version of the report omits the name without
giving any explanation for the change.

The report said fenugreek seeds imported from Egypt in 2009 and/or
2010 were implicated in the French illness cluster. The strain in the
French illnesses matches the strain in the massive _E. coli_ outbreak
centered in Germany. The ECDC and EFSA called for urgent
investigations into the distribution of the implicated lots of seeds,
because of a risk of more cases.

In response to a query today [1 Jul 2011] about the reason for
removing the company's name, ECDC spokeswoman Caroline Daamen told
CIDRAP News by email, "In the initial risk assessment posted on the
website, EFSA and ECDC reported information that had been made
available to support the ongoing outbreak investigation. However, some
key partners involved felt that it may unnecessarily harm the company
to publish its name while the investigations are still ongoing. So it
was thought more appropriate to remove the name of the company from
the final report. We hope that this helps to clarify why the name of
the company is not included anymore."

The ECDC's action in dropping the name without an explanation was
sharply criticized by Michael T Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the
University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and
Policy, publisher of CIDRAP News. "I really think they compromised
public health practice by removing the name of the company and not
saying why, particularly since more fenugreek seeds may still be out
in the public domain," he said.

"If it is not correct, they should go back and correct that," he
added. "But if they're letting the company dictate to them, they're
really not doing their job. It really is public health malpractice not
to name these companies when they're involved, particularly when
there's a potential risk to the public as a result of their product
still being on the market."

[4] Egyptian statement

The Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture on Friday [1 Jul 2011] denied
media reports that it is the origin of the _E. coli_ bacteria, which
recently broke out in some European countries, state news agency MENA
reported.

No traces or infections of the deadly bacteria were recorded in Egypt
so far, the head of the agricultural quarantine central department at
the ministry Ali Soliman said, stressing this bacterium is not proved
existing in Egypt. He denied reports published in world media outlets
that Egypt's fenugreek was the reason behind the transmission of the
bacteria.

Soliman said that the Ministry of Agricultural received a letter from
the European Union asserting that the results of microbiological lab
tests on fenugreek all came out negative. He added that [in 2009
Egyptian companies did not export fenugreek to France, Britain, or
Germany].
