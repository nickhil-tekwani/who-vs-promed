Namibia has registered its 1st case of listeriosis since the beginning of the epidemic in neighboring South Africa which has killed at least 183 people in the country, the Namibian Ministry of Health said today [13 Mar 2018].

"A 41-year-old man was diagnosed with listeriosis at the private Catholic hospital in Windhoek on [12 Mar 2018]," Namibian Health Minister Bernard Haufiku said in a statement. "This is the 1st case of listeriosis in Namibia since the beginning of the epidemic in neighboring South Africa," he added. The patient is reported to have eaten Vienna sausages in Tsumeb town in [Oshikoto region] in northern Namibia, he said, adding that he was "in a stable state".

The minister again called on the population not to consume sausages produced in South Africa. This country is experiencing the worst epidemic in the world of listeriosis, which has killed at least 183 people since January 2017, according to the latest assessment of the South African authorities. After months of investigation, the source of the infection was finally identified on [4 Mar 2018], the Enterprise Food in South Africa.

The bacterium that causes listeriosis was also found in a sample from one of South Africa's Rainbow Chickens plants. The South African authorities have since temporarily suspended the export licenses of these 2 companies.

Listeriosis is caused by bacteria in soil, water, vegetation, and animal excrement, and can contaminate food, including meat, dairy products, and seafood.

The most vulnerable people include premature babies and pregnant women.

[Multiple countries in Africa that have imposed restrictions on South African meat imports include Namibia, Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Zambia, and Zimbabwe (https://www.thesouthafrican.com/listeriosis-namibia-records-first-case-after-sa-outbreak/).

The 41-year-old Namibian man who was diagnosed with listeriosis was said in the news report above to have eaten Vienna sausages in Tsumeb, a city of 15 000 residents in northern Namibia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsumeb). However, we are not told if the Vienna sausages eaten by this man were imported from South Africa and manufactured by Enterprise Foods that produced the _Listeria_- contaminated ready-to-eat meat products involved in the South African listeriosis outbreak. Genotyping _Listeria_ isolated from the Namibian patient and the Vienna sausages he ate would help link this patient to the listeriosis outbreak in South Africa. Ready-to-eat meat is a common source for listeriosis. If the genotype of the Namibian isolates does not match the genotype found in the South Africa outbreak strain, listeriosis in the Namibian man was likely due to a locally acquired strain.
