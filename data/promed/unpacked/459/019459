At least 51 people have died after drinking tainted homemade alcohol in Tripoli, Libyan health officials say. They say 378 have been taken to the capital's hospitals since Saturday [9 Mar 2013], and the number may rise further.

A hospital official told the BBC the deaths occurred from methanol poisoning and that many patients were undergoing kidney dialysis for treatment. The consumption and sale of alcohol is illegal in Libya, but it is available on the black market.

The Libyan health officials say 38 people have now died in Tripoli hospitals and another 13 as they were travelling to neighboring Tunisia for treatment.

A state of emergency has been declared in the capital's hospitals. The alcohol in question is a cheap local brew known as Bokha. It is distilled from various fruits like figs, dates, or grapes.

But industrial spirits -- like methanol -- are sometimes used to increase the potency of the drink, the BBC's Rana Jawad in Tripoli reports. Health risks after drinking methanol include kidney failure, blindness, seizures, and death.

Interior ministry official Hussein al-Amry told the BBC that special units had surrounded locations where the homemade alcohol was thought to have been brewed.

He added that the ministry was prepared to use force if the owners did not comply with an order to vacate the premises. Alcohol is also smuggled into Libya from Tunisia, Algeria, and Malta.

Methanol (wood alcohol) is produced from the destructive distillation of wood. Epidemics of methanol toxicity have resulted from the consumption of methanol-contaminated whiskey or other alcohol products. The formation of 2 toxic metabolites, formaldehyde and formic acid, causes methanol poisoning. The elimination rate depends upon the folate pool. In primates it is generally small and consequently primates (including humans) are more sensitive to methanol toxicity than other animals.

Methanol is widely available in formulations including antifreeze, windshield washer fluid, Sterno canned heat, shellacs, various paints, paint removers, varnishes, duplicating fluids, and gasoline additives.

Fatalities have been reported after ingestion of 15 ml or 3 teaspoons of a 40 per cent solution, although 30 ml is generally considered a minimal lethal dose. With aggressive medical care it is possible to survive the ingestion of 500-600 ml. However, consumption of as little as 10 ml may cause blindness, depending on the amount and individual tolerance.

Methanol is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and peak levels occur generally within 30-90 minutes. It is distributed into tissues, so concentrations in the vitreous humor and optic nerve are high. The highest concentrations are found in the kidney, liver, and gastrointestinal tract, with smaller concentrations in the brain, muscle, and adipose tissues.

Methanol is oxidized 10 times more slowly than ethanol. Consequently there is a longer elimination half-life.

Onset of symptoms varies between 40 minutes and 72 hours after ingestion. Co-ingestion with alcohol will delay the appearance of symptoms, but the absence of symptoms does not exclude serious toxicity. The usual latent period is 12-24 hours.

Clinical signs may include headache, vertigo, lethargy, and confusion, which are common in mild to moderate ethanol intoxications. Coma and convulsions appear in severe cases, probably as a result of cerebral edema. Methanol produces little to no euphoria, unlike ethanol.

Blurred vision, decreased visual acuity, and photophobia (sensitivity to light) are common complaints. Constricted visual fields, fixed and dilated pupils, retinal edema, and hyperemia of the optic disk are common clinical findings. Prompt initial therapy is necessary to reverse symptoms, though visual defects have persisted in up to 25 per cent of severe cases.

Methanol is a mucosal irritant and may produce nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, not unlike large doses of ethanol.

Early in the clinical course, gut decontamination with ipecac or lavage may be indicated. However, if the methanol is mixed with ethanol, these patients may not realize something is out of the ordinary until it is too late for this type of treatment to be helpful.

Intravenous administration of ethanol in a 10 per cent dextrose solution may be helpful. As ethanol prolongs the elimination half-life of methanol, the treatment may take several days and the patient should be hospitalized. Dialysis may be necessary to prevent kidney failure as well. Hemodialysis remains an effective treatment. - Mod.TG]
