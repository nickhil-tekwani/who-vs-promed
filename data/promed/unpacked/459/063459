In the above referenced post (20041021.2851), the only city mentioned is
Denver. Although the television station from which the article originated
is in Denver, the actual incident occurred in Colorado Springs, El Paso
County, Colorado about 60 miles South of Denver.

[Our thanks to Jim for this correction. In the original script sent to our
editors the town of Colorado Springs was identified. Somehow in the
handling it got deleted. Apologies. Somehow I suspect that the affected
animal may have been a ground squirrel, not a tree squirrel. If anyone can
clarify this, I would appreciate it. - Mod.MHJ]
