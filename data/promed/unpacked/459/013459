A person tested positive for Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) or monkey fever on [Wed 10 Jan 2018], taking the number of cases detected in Sattari to 8.

Health officer at the Community Health Centre [CHC], Dr Gajanan Naik, said that Manipal Centre for Virus Research, Manipal University detected 8 cases of monkey fever this season, and added that the patients are from Kumthal, Velge, and Budruk-Karmalli.

The 7 patients are fine and discharged from CHC, Dr Naik added. He further said that a male patient, who has tested positive on [Wed 10 Jan 2018], is undergoing treatment at the CHC. The number of cases found positive for KFD has raised concern among the residents of Sanvorde panchayat. The authorities will be intensifying their awareness in the villages by conducting information, education and communication (IEC) programmes.

"We have distributed DMP [dimethyl phthalate] tick repellent oil to the villagers of Budruk-Karmali and held an advocacy workshop for the villagers" said Dr Naik.

Before handing over the oil to the villagers, nodal officer Dr Abhijit Wadkar said: "Preventive measures against the monkey fever are being implemented. The villagers cannot stop themselves from venturing into the cashew plantations, as it is their livelihood. Measures such as covering the entire body before entering the forest and applying DMP oil can prevent them from getting affected by the disease."

[Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) is a tick-borne viral hemorrhagic fever endemic to South Asia. The disease was first reported from Kyasanur Forest near Sagar in Shivamogga district of Karnataka in India in 1957. Its outbreak then was among monkeys, killing several of them. Hence, the disease is locally known as 'monkey fever'. It is caused by a virus belonging to the family Flaviviridae, which also includes yellow fever and dengue fever. The disease is carried by ticks, rodents, birds, etc., and it affects monkeys and human beings. It is a vector borne disease. KFD is common in states like Goa, Karnataka (in Shivamogga), and Kerala (in Wayanad and Malappuram). It was also reported from parts of Bandipur National Park (Chamarajanagar) and parts of the Nilgiris. The disease mostly occurs between November to March.

The spread of KFD to newer areas is a major cause for concern. It is endemic in 5 districts of Karnataka, and there are recent reports of spread to Chamarajanagar, Nilgiri, Wayanad, and Malappuram districts of the Western Ghats, which stretch from north to south, covers the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala, and comprises 39 properties including wildlife sanctuaries, national parks, and reserve forests (World Heritage Centre. United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Western Ghats (http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1342/). The spread of KFDV to newer areas is most probably due to the movement of monkeys and small rodents, which harbor the virus. People residing in the forest areas, as well as those working in the parks, sanctuaries, and reserve forests are at high risk of acquiring the disease.

No specific exposure is mentioned in the report above and any evidence of human to human transmission needs further epidemiological investigation - Mod.UBA
