The poultry industry has been given an official ultimatum to accept a
HKD 1 billion [USD 128.1 million] government compensation package to
shut down their businesses or face an uncertain future. The city's
469 chicken retailers have been told they must decide what to do by
24 Jul 2008 while farmers, wholesalers, and transport workers have
been given until 24 Sep 2008.

Secretary for Food and Health, York Chow Yat-ngok, said this was the
government's final offer after a meeting of the Executive Council
yesterday [24 Jun 2008].

As well as retailers, Hong Kong has 71 wholesalers, 50 chicken farms,
and 266 transport workers who depend on the trade for their
livelihood. However, if the retailers accept the buyout deal it will
effectively end the businesses of the rest of the sector as well as
Hong Kong's culture of cooking live chickens.

The need for central slaughtering by 2011 may also be made redundant.

Chow expressed confidence that most of the retailers will accept the
deal, which is more than 3 times the 2005 Voluntary Surrender Scheme.

Many of the traders said they can't operate under the overnight ban
and they are also considering the risk of facing another bird flu
outbreak within the next few years, he said.

But the government will only approve the offer when 90 percent of the
trade accepts it. Another offer will not be tabled in the future
before central slaughtering, Chow added.

A source said the government has improved the deal for retailers with
an increase of almost HKD 100 million [USD 12.8 million] or over 20
percent to a total of HKD 513 million [USD 65.7 million].

A source said the increase was justified.

"If we terminate the trade's tools for living out of public health
concerns, we must be more reasonable in our offer," the source said,
adding that no further increase is expected after any future
negotiations.

Retailers who choose to resume operation on 2 Jul 2008 must operate
under an overnight ban [that requires] keeping live chickens in the
stalls between 8 pm and 5 am. Violators are subject to a penalty of
HKD 50 000 [USD 6406] and 6 months' imprisonment. The amendments of
the law will be gazetted this week and will be tabled at the
Legislative Council for negative vetting.

Chow believes the overnight ban will be agreed to by lawmakers out of
public health concerns. "H5N1 is not political, we must be scientific
in dealing with it," he said.

Chow said the [owners] of 400 000 chickens, which have been held in
farms due to the ban and can no longer be sold because they are too
old, will be compensated for at a rate of HKD 30 [USD 3.84] per bird.

A source said the government fears the recent discovery of the H5N1
virus in the chickens of 4 wet markets is not a problem of smuggling,
but a drop in chickens' immunity against the virus.

[Science-based clarification of the claims that immunity problems are
at the background of the recent H5N1 upsurge in HK will be helpful.
Since 2003, the prevention and control measures there seemed to have
been very effective. - Mod.AS]

Swabi Poultry Association says H5N9 mistaken for H5N1
-----------------------------------------------------
Swabi Poultry Association (SPA) on Wednesday [25 Jun 2008] staged a
protest demonstration against the District Livestock and Dairy
Development Department and the National Research Institute (NRI),
Islamabad, for what they called 'mistaking an H5N9 strain for H5N1'
that caused bird flu.

The authorities had detected H5N1 strain at a poultry farm in Swabi
(NWFP) [on 21 Jun 2008] and ordered immediate closure of the farm and
culling of 2000 birds. The association's office-bearers said that
they had conducted their own test at the Poultry Research Institute
(PRI), Rawalpindi, where the strain was identified as H5N9. The
association's president, Zabiullah, demanded that the government
constitute an impartial committee that should take samples for fresh
tests. He warned that if the government failed to listen to their
demand by 30 Jun 2008, they would hold a hunger strike camp in front
of the NWFP Assembly.

[Pakistan declared itself free of HPNAI (highly pathogenic notifiable
avian influenza), with effect from 4 Jun 2008, in its final report to
OIE (World Organisation for Animal health) dated 17 Jun 2008 and
available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=7125>.

Should the diagnosis of H5N1 in Swabi be finally confirmed, an
immediate notification to the OIE is anticipated.

In case SPA's claim that the virus is rather H5N9 is confirmed, its
notification will be required as well since all H5 strains are
notifiable. It will remain to establish the pathogenicity of the
virus. According to the initial media-derived information, more than
4000 birds out of 6000 on the affected commercial farm in Swabi died;
such mortality may be an indication -- in need of laboratory
confirmation -- that the virus strain currently involved is highly
pathogenic. - Mod.AS]
