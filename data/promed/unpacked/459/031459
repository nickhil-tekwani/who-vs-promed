The health authorities are investigating the suspicious death of a child and more generally an increase in the number of serious cases in children with _E. coli_ bacteria in France since the beginning of February 2022. Thirteen cases in children aged 1 to 15 occurred in the regions of New Aquitaine (5 cases), Hauts-de-France (3 cases), Ile-de-France (3 cases), Brittany (1 case), and Pays de the Loire (1 case), the public Health agency France indicated on Friday evening, 25 Feb 2022.

"A child has died," added the health agency, which has not specified the date of death or the age of the child. All these children were affected by hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). This disease, whose origin is most often food, is potentially serious for young children: it is a complication of an episode of often bloody diarrhea, which can cause acute renal failure. It is frequently caused by bacteria belonging to the _Escherichia coli_ family.

The investigation, which covers all cases of pediatric HUS reported since early January (31 so far), aims to "identify a possible common source of infection and put in place appropriate measures."

"At this stage, the epidemiological investigation is not excluding any leads", indicates Public Health France. Several sources of potential contamination are being explored: ingestion of contaminated food eaten raw or undercooked, contamination by soiled hands put in the mouth after touching animals carrying the bacteria or their contaminated environment, or contact with a sick person who excretes the bacteria in their stool.

Each year, between 100 and 165 children with hemolytic uremic syndrome are notified to Public Health France, which has set up a surveillance system for this disease since 1996, according to the press release.

[In general, outbreaks of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ do not have HUS as a complication in any more than 10%. If there are 13 cases of HUS, many more cases of the Shiga toxin-producing _E coli_ likely occurred. The vehicle or vehicles for transmission are not stated.

The following by Joseph et al. is a good basic review on HUS:
Joseph A, Cointe A, Kurkdjian P M, et al. Shiga toxin-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome: a narrative review. Toxins. 2020; 12(2): 67; https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins12020067.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
"The severity of human infection by one of the many Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ (STEC) is determined by a number of factors: the bacterial genome, the capacity of human societies to prevent foodborne epidemics, the medical condition of infected patients (in particular their hydration status, often compromised by severe diarrhea), and by our capacity to devise new therapeutic approaches, most specifically to combat the bacterial virulence factors, as opposed to our current strategies that essentially aim to palliate organ deficiencies. The last major outbreak in 2011 in Germany, which killed more than 50 people in Europe, was evidence that an effective treatment was still lacking. Herein, we review the current knowledge of STEC virulence, how societies organize the prevention of human disease, and how physicians treat (and, hopefully, will treat) its potentially fatal complications. In particular, we focus on STEC-induced hemolytic and uremic syndrome (HUS), where the intrusion of toxins inside endothelial cells results in massive cell death, activation of the coagulation within capillaries, and eventually organ failure."

Regarding EHEC O80, Soysal et al (1) brought forth more information regarding this hybrid EHEC which contains a rare variant of the intimin gene and genetic determinants related to a plasmid, found mostly in avian pathogenic _E. coli_ and _E. coli_ that causes human neonatal meningitis, which is associated with extraintestinal virulence. This group, led by Stephane Bonacorsi, originally reported this atypical organism in an adult associated with HUS with a relapse associated with bacteremia (2).

The 2016 study reported that 96% of the cases were associated with HUS, but the authors do point out that the surveillance system for EHEC is voluntary in France, and PCR assays for Shiga toxin in stool are done only in cases involving diarrhea with HUS suspicion, so the denominator of total O80:H2 cases is not known. Likewise, whether this organism is zoonotic is also not clear, and the areas in France with this strain are not where most cases of _E. coli_ O157 are reported.

Regarding the use of antimicrobials and O80, the issue is relevant in these cases because some of them are associated with bacteremia, which requires antimicrobial therapy. Azithromycin and ceftriaxone were not associated with increasing Shiga toxin production, whereas ciprofloxacin was in this study. In the large _E. coli_ O104:H4 outbreak in northern Germany, therapy was also used especially in those cases where the colon was perforated. In those reports, the carbapenem antimicrobials also did not increase toxin production. Whether these effects are strain specific is not clear at this time so should not necessarily be generalized to all EHEC. Of note, the _E. coli_ O104:H4 strain was a genetic hybrid between EHEC and enteroaggregative _E. coli_ and was not thought to be a zoonosis.

Extraintestinal invasive strains of EHEC will indeed introduce another layer of concern about these infections.
