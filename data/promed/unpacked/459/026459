A jackal suspected of having contracted rabies was caught on 9 Jun 2018. In light of this development, we ask any person exposed to the suspected jackal, or any pet owner that their pet was exposed to a wild animal, or found wounded in the area between 8 to 9 Jun 2018 to urgently contact the Tiberias Health Bureau, Tel 04-6710300 or the nearest health bureau. After working hours and during weekends or holidays, refer to hospital emergency wards. Dog owners should contact the municipal vet to test for immunization. We ask this information be shared with travelers and vacationers at the Hamat Gader area and close-by populated areas. Parents should ask their children whether they were exposed to suspect rabid animals and urgently contact the local health bureau.

The Ministry of Health would like to remind members of the public that in case of a bite or scratch by an animal, immediately wash the affected area with running water and soap, disinfect it, and then proceed to a health bureau to check whether rabies post-exposure prophylaxis is necessary.

This press release from the Ministry of Health was preceded by an earlier press release from the Ministry, published on Mon 4 Jun 2018, reporting the identification of a lab-confirmed case of rabies in a jackal in the same location (see https://www.health.gov.il/English/News_and_Events/Spokespersons_Messages/Pages/04062018_3.aspx). Unfortunately, campers continued visiting the site, exposed to (other?) attacking jackals. The incident was filmed and shown on Israel TV news.

Hamat-Gader, a popular hot-springs bathing location, has now been put under restrictions and its camping site temporarily closed. It is located very close to the border between Israel and the Kingdom of Jordan, whose jackal population deserves being attended/surveyed as well (map at https://tinyurl.com/ybtwh4ca).

On Wed 6 Jun 2018, Israel's Field Veterinary Services (Ministry of Agriculture) published the following circular:

"Rabies case no. 51, 2018, Jackal, Hamat-Gader, Ref lab report A00322149

"On Sun 3 Jun 2018, a golden jackal attacked 3 women visiting Hamat-Gader. An inspector of the Nature Reserves Authority was called upon and killed 2 jackals. Their carcasses were submitted to the Kimron Veterinary Institute [KVI] where rabies was confirmed in the brain of one jackal. The exposed women were referred to the Health Ministry for further treatment" (see http://www.moag.gov.il/vet/Yechidot/Machon/maabada_kalevet/airueim%20kalevet/Documents/mikre_51_2018.pdf; in Hebrew).

The jackal rabies case of 3 Jun 2018 was the 1st one to appear in this species after a pause of a month since the previous rabies case in a jackal (2 May 2018). Previously, cases were recorded every week. This may, unfortunately, mean that the unusual, severe rabies epizootic in jackals, affecting northern Israel since October 2017, is not yet over.

For subscribers' convenience, we hereby reproduce Israel's annual rabies statistics since 2014:

Year // dog / cat / fox / jackal / wolf / badger / cattle / sheep / horse // total

2014 // 3 / 0 / 2 / 2 / 4 / 2 / 1 / 0 / 0 // 14
2015 // 12 / 1 / 1 / 3 / 0 / 1 / 7 / 0 / 1 // 27
2016 // 12 / 0 / 7 / 5 / 0 / 0 / 5 / 0 / 1 // 30
2017 // 10 / 2 / 0 / 47 / 0 / 0 / 14 / 1 / 0 // 74
2018* // 4 / 0 / 0 / 35 / 0 / 1 / 7 / 1 / 1 // 51
* as of 3 Jun 2018

* as of 3 Jun 2018

The striking change in the spread of rabies in and by means of jackals remains to be explained. During almost 15 years, Israel's control scheme of sylvatic rabies, by the countrywide dissemination of vaccine-laden baits for the oral vaccination of foxes and jackals, seemed to be successful. Prior to the implementation of the oral vaccination scheme, rabies affected mainly red foxes; it has become rather rare in this species.

What has changed (ecology/population dynamics? vaccine's efficacy? bait's dispersal policy? climatic changes? rabies situation in neighboring countries? otherwise?) remains to be adequately investigated for lessons to be drawn, locally and beyond. - Mod.AS]

[2] Malaysia (Serian, Sarawak province): human case, animals

A woman has died from rabies-related complications in Sarawak after being bitten by a dog that her father adopted, bringing the death toll to 10 since an outbreak was declared last year [2017].

Health director-general Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said the latest case involved a 21-year-old woman from Kg Joran Bari, Serian, who was bitten on the right arm by her own dog while she was bathing it on 20 Apr 2018.

He said since the rabies epidemic was declared in Sarawak on 1 Jul 2017, the number of confirmed rabies cases among humans was 11 with 10 fatalities, while one person had been discharged from hospital with severe neurological problems and was being treated at home.

"The patient (in the latest case) had been given treatment for her wounds and anti-tetanus injection at the Serian Hospital on the night of the incident and was advised to get further treatment at the dog bite clinic at the Serian Hospital the next day, but she did not go," he said in a statement on the kpkesihatan.com website today [1 Jun 2018] https://kpkesihatan.com/2018/06/01/kenyataan-akhbar-kpk-1-jun-2018-kes-terbaru-rabies-di-kalangan-manusia-di-sarawak/ in Malay].

"The dog which bit her was a wild dog which her father adopted 3 weeks before the incident, and had never been given anti-rabies vaccination," he said.

Noor Hisham said on 20 May 2018, the woman received treatment at the emergency and trauma department at the Sarawak General Hospital (HUS) after she complained of pain and weakness in her right shoulder for 4 days.

He said the woman's condition became worse as she showed symptoms of hallucination, fever and lost of reflex in both her hands, and died at 5 am yesterday [31 May 2018].

"The clinical sample of the case was sent to the Institute of Medical Research on [31 May 2018] and confirmed positive for rabies," he said.

"The Health Ministry wants to stress that the prevention of rabies infection in humans is very dependent on the success of controlling rabies among dogs, so the public must cooperate by bringing their pets for vaccination," he said.

Last [Tue 29 May 2018], the Sarawak Disaster Management Committee chaired by Sarawak Deputy Chief Minister Douglas Uggah declared Kg Selarat Sematan in the Lundu district as a new rabies epidemic area, bringing the total so far to 31 areas in 5 districts in Sarawak.

[3] Viet Nam (Hoa Binh, Lang Son provinces): human cases
Date: Wed 30 May 2018 07:53 ICT

http://english.vietnamnet.vn/fms/society/201491/two-boys-die-of-rabies.html


Two ethnic minority boys in the northern provinces of Hoa Binh and Lang Son have died of rabies over the past 5 days, said Dr Bui Huy Vu from the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases.

Vu, head of the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases' Paediatrics Ward, said that the 1st patient, who was 12 years old in Hoa Binh province, was hospitalised on 18 May 2018 in critical condition. The boy feared water and light and exhibited some mental disorders. Despite intensive treatment, he died.

His family raised a dog that was sold as it was sick, while the family kept its puppies. While playing with the puppies, he was bitten by one of them. He did not tell his parents about the bite until he suffered from the symptoms of rabies.

The 2nd boy who was 9 years old in Lang Son province was taken to the hospital on 22 May 2018. He had clear symptoms of rabies and died on the same day.

According to his parents, he did not tell them about being scratched by his family's dog which died 13 days ago.

Dr Vu said that people need to be vaccinated against rabies after being attacked by dogs or cats.

When cats or dogs bite people, they need to be kept within 10 days to find out whether they have rabies instead of being sold or slaughtered for meat to prevent the disease infection. Anyone who touches on its saliva can be infected with rabies, Huy warned.

Cats and dogs need to be vaccinated against rabies and also need to wear muzzles in public places.

[4] Kenya (Siaya, Kisumu counties): human exposure
Date: Mon 4 Jun 2018 18:24 GMT +3
Source: Standard Media [edited]
https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2001282761/pain-for-victims-of-dog-bites-as-shortage-of-anti-rabbies-vaccine-bites


Veterinary doctors are asking the 2 county governments to ensure that public hospital stock rabies vaccines following a rise in dog bites in the regions.

The vets who spoke to The Standard yesterday [3 Jun 2018] painted a disturbing picture of victims left to die in untold agony at home as rabid dogs continued to roam the villages.

Figures from the Siaya county government put the dog population at over 320 000 while Kisumu is estimated to have an even larger number. In Rarieda, The Standard team found dog-bite victim, 56, in pain as she cleaned an open wound on her left leg. She had been bitten by 3 dogs on [Thu 31 May 2018]. "I went to the nearby health facility but they did not have the rabies vaccine. I am in a lot of pain," she said, adding that she had resorted to using herbal medicine to ease the pain but she was not getting any respite [see comment below].

But even when it is available, the rabies vaccine is too expensive for the villagers. A single dose in the public hospitals costs Sh 1500 [about USD 15], and a dog-bite victim needs 5 doses, adding up to sh 7500 [about USD 74].

Another victim said although he had money for treatment, all the health facilities he visited in Siaya had no vaccine. "I visited 5 sub-county hospitals but did not find a single dose of the vaccine. I have bought painkillers to ease my pain although the wound is still bleeding."

Bondo sub-county veterinary officer Mark Otieno said the county suffered from a high prevalence of rabies, with more dog bites reported every year. "One household is estimated to have at least 3 dogs, which are not trained in most cases." Mr Otieno noted that the county government carried out mass dog vaccinations every year to eliminate rabies but the rising dog population made the task harder. "The birth rates are too high. Within 2 months we have a population of new puppies that have not been vaccinated." Head of the Zoonotic Diseases Unit (ZDU) Mathew Muturi told The Standard that there were challenges in rabies diagnosis and in estimating the true burden of the viral disease. He said the county government was working in collaboration with ZDU and the Kenya Medical Research Institute to get valid data on the true picture of the disease.

[The 2 bitten persons interviewed may have contracted the disease if the biting animals were rabid; this is not yet confirmed but in any event, both are in urgent need of post-exposure-vaccination. In case the vector animals were factually rabid and infection did take place, clinical signs may generally appear in the victims after an incubation period of several days, even weeks. At this early stage after the incidents, it is essential to follow-up the biting animals and note if they show clinical symptoms during the 10 days after the biting.

It remains to hope that rabies vaccines and antiserum become available in the local medical facilities at the earliest, either for the 2 victims described or for potential others. - Mod.AS
