FDA continues to caution dog owners about chicken jerky products
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is again cautioning consumers
that chicken jerky products for dogs (also sold as chicken tenders,
strips, or treats) may be associated with illness in dogs. In the last
12 months, FDA has seen an increase in the number of complaints it
received of dog illnesses associated with consumption of chicken jerky
products imported from China. These complaints have been reported to
FDA by dog owners and veterinarians.

FDA issued a cautionary warning regarding chicken jerky products to
consumers in September 2007 and a Preliminary Animal Health
Notification in December of 2008. After seeing the number of
complaints received drop off during the latter part of 2009 and most
of 2010, the FDA is once again seeing the number of complaints rise to
the levels of concern that prompted release of our earlier warnings.

Chicken jerky products should not be substituted for a balanced diet
and are intended to be fed occasionally in small quantities.

FDA is advising consumers who choose to feed their dogs chicken jerky
products to watch their dogs closely for any or all of the following
signs that may occur within hours to days of feeding the products:
decreased appetite; decreased activity; vomiting; diarrhea, sometimes
with blood; increased water consumption and/or increased urination. If
the dog shows any of these signs, stop feeding the chicken jerky
product. Owners should consult their veterinarian if signs are severe
or persist for more than 24 hours. Blood tests may indicate kidney
failure (increased urea nitrogen and creatinine). Urine tests may
indicate Fanconi syndrome (increased glucose). Although most dogs
appear to recover, some reports to the FDA have involved dogs that
have died.

FDA, in addition to several animal health diagnostic laboratories in
the US, is working to determine why these products are associated with
illness in dogs. FDA's Veterinary Laboratory Response Network (VLRN)
is now available to support these animal health diagnostic
laboratories. To date, scientists have not been able to determine a
definitive cause for the reported illnesses. FDA continues extensive
chemical and microbial testing but has not identified a contaminant.

The FDA continues to actively investigate the problem and its origin.
Many of the illnesses reported may be the result of causes other than
eating chicken jerky. Veterinarians and consumers alike should report
cases of animal illness associated with pet foods to the FDA Consumer
Complaint Coordinator in their state or go to

[This has been an ongoing issue for several years. Interestingly, it
is all imported products. There are products made in the USA that are
not causing a problem in pets. However, it is wise to remember that
treats are designed to be given periodically and are not to make up
the majority of the pet's diet.

FDA seems to have received verified information of at least 70 dogs
affected this year (2011), which is up from 54 last year. - Mod.TG]
