Should the world be caught without an effective vaccine or antiviral
treatment for an avian flu pandemic, a last-ditch option may be to
inoculate the sick with antibodies from the blood of those who are able to
recover from the disease, according to a review of studies published after
the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic.
The H5N1 virus has killed 141 of the 241 people reported to have contracted
it. Current manufacturing capacity could vaccinate less than 5 per cent of
the world's population in the event of a pandemic, however, making
alternative treatments extremely desirable. One method known to work in
other viral diseases such as rabies and measles is to transfer the blood of
a recovered patient to a sick one, giving the latter antibodies against the
pathogen.
Transfusions were also tried in the 1918 flu pandemic but hadn't been
studied extensively, so US military and biotech researchers searched the
medical literature published between 1918 and 1925 for reports of the
treatment. Those who received blood transfusions were 21 per cent more
likely to survive a case of influenza-induced pneumonia than those who
didn't receive the treatment, they found in a survey of 8 studies. Of 336
total people treated, 16 per cent died from the pneumonia compared with 37
per cent of those in control groups. Of the treated individuals, those who
had received a transfusion within the first 3 days of contracting pneumonia
were 41 per cent more likely to survive than those treated afterward.
"Our analysis suggests that patients with Spanish influenza pneumonia who
received transfusion may have experienced a clinically important reduction
in the risk for death and improvements in clinical signs and symptoms," the
researchers report in a paper published online on 29 Aug 2006 in the Annals
of Internal Medicine (Luke TC, Kilbane EM, Jackson JL, Hoffman SL.
Meta-analysis: convalescent blood products for Spanish influnza pneumonia:
a future H5N1 treatment? Ann Intern Med 2006; 145(8)
<http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/0000605-200610170-00139v1>). "Our
findings are provocative, but our review has important limitations," they
point out. The old studies were small and poorly done by current standards.
Nevertheless, "the concept is important and it should be explored further,
especially given our lack of proven interventions to prevent or treat
illness due to H5N1 influenza," writes John Treanor of the University of
Rochester in an accompanying editorial. Serum from recovered patients would
be technically simple to prepare and presumably in ample supply, he says,
although researchers don't know if those who recover from H5N1 produce
copious antibodies. He notes that "controlled clinical studies done now
will probably pay a considerable dividend when the pandemic begins."

[The practicality of this approach is open to question. Post-exposure
antibody-containing sera would become available in quantity only after a
pandemic situation had arisen. Furthermore live H5N1 avian influenza virus
can be isolated from the blood of human cases and H5N1 virus can spread via
the bloodstream to parts of the body not normally attacked by influenza
viruses, posing challenges for both patient treatment and reagent control
(see: Avian influenza, human - worldwide (58): viremia 20060505.1307).
In 2005 researchers at Oxford University's Clinical Research Unit in Ho Chi
Minh City in Viet Nam described the case of a boy whose H5N1 infection
spread to his brain, causing encephalitis. These workers reported also that
they were able to detect viral RNA in the blood of about half of the H5N1
patients they examined.
Nonetheless this approach might have some merit in response to the
emergence of a pandemic virus of exceptional virulence with an unpredicted
combination of antigens. - Mod.CP]
