Lassa fever situation
---------------------
The Health Authorities of the Ministry of Health have been informed by the Office of the WHO of the report of a case of Lassa fever in the Préfecture of Ganta (Liberia).

They had been informed that a woman from Guinea had been received by the Methodist Clinic in Ganta on [Tue 9 Jan 2018], had died on [Thu 11 Jan 2018] and had been buried in a dignified and secure mannerin the same Préfecture of Ganta (Liberia).

The results of the blood tests which were received by WHO on [Sat 13 Jan 2018], confirmed the nature of the disease [as Lassa fever]. None of the patient's contacts in Liberia have been ill, or tested positive for Lassa fever.

On [Fri 19 Jan 2018], an investigating mission met at Guécke, Yomou Préfecture, the locality of the origin of the case. This team registered 28 contacts of the patient, all of whom are now free, after 21 days of being regularly followed, without being ill, under the WHO directives. None of the patient's contacts in Guinea has been ill or has tested positive for Lassa Fever.

On the base of these results of the epidemiological investigations which have been undertaken , Guinea is not in an epidemic situation for Lassa fever.

The Minister for Health follows as a systematic and preventative system:
1 - The sensitization of the population and the Public Health and Hygiene Services on the universal prevention and control measures of infections.
2 - The reinforcement of epidemiological surveillance.

[It is good to learn that there are no secondary cases following the death of the woman from Guinea who died in Liberia. As noted when this case was 1st posted on [Thu 8 Feb 2018], this is the 1st Lassa fever case that ProMED-mail has posted for Guinea. The report above indicates that the affected individual actually died in Liberia, but indicates that the infection was acquired in Guinea. Liberia, also a West African country, is endemic for Lassa virus. Lassa fever cases have been reported sporadically there. The Lassa fever belt in Liberia primarily occupies Lofa, Bong and Nimba Counties across the northern tier of counties bordering Guinea. West Africa, including Guinea and Liberia, is endemic for Lassa fever virus.

The situation where the person acquired Lassa fever virus is not indicated in this case. Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or its excreta, as was likely the situation in this case. Rodent control has to be undertaken at the village level with individual households. This requires an extensive and continuous public education effort. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients.

Images of the _Mastomys_ mouse, the rodent reservoir of Lassa fever virus, can be seen at https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/45326-Mastomys-natalensis.

ProMED-mail thanks Irene Lai for sending in this official Guinea government report issued by the Minister of Health.
