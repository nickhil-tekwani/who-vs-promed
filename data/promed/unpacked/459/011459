I believe that concern about vaccinating wildlife with unapproved vaccines
would come from the possibility (proabably remote) that the vaccine might:

1) Mask an active rabies infection, by preventing clinical symptoms.
2) Promote the spread of rabies by altering the animals immune response.
3) Provide false assurances of protection, if it did not work. (Though
in wildlife, this assurance is probably not important unless the animal is
somehow marked as vaccinated...ear tag, tatoo, electronic ID implant, etc.)
These are answers that can be obtained from challenge studies. Because
these are killed products, they seem unlikely to cause rabies. But what
affect does vaccination have on an actively infected animal, say where the
infection has already reached the brain, but has not traveled to the
salivary glands? Is it too late to mount an immune response? Could the
natural course of the disease be altered? Have there been any studies that
have shown vaccination has promoted the spread of any disease in infected
animals or people for that
matter.
We use hyper-immunization to try and stimulate an immune response in people
in post exposure situations. A single dose of killed vaccine, though, is
not likely to have the same effect.
