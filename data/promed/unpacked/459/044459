[ProMED-mail would like to thank Michael Hiscock of the Canadian Food
Inspection Agency for his rapid response to a telephone page on Saturday
inquiring about additional information on this current food recall.
As can been seen from the two prior recall notices back in September 2001
(and the ProMED-mail postings on the recalls in both Canada and Australia
associated with this brand of peanuts also in September 2001), the suspected
product did have national (and international) distribution. The organism
identified in September 2001 was _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Stanley and
was confirmed to be associated with this product.
While the current recall identifies a single retail establishment in
Edmonton, Alberta, there are concerns because of the prior known nationwide
distribution of the product. Note: the product identification number is the
same as that involved in the September 2001 recall. -Mod.MPP]
