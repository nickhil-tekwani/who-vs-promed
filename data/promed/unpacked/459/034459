Report says global poultry industry is the root of the bird flu crisis
-----------------------------------------------
Small-scale poultry farming and wild birds are being unfairly blamed for
the bird flu crisis now affecting large parts of the world. A new report
from GRAIN shows how the transnational poultry industry is the root of the
problem and must be the focus of efforts to control the virus. (1)
The spread of industrial poultry production and trade networks has created
ideal conditions for the emergence and transmission of lethal viruses like
the H5N1 strain of bird flu. Once inside densely populated factory farms,
viruses can rapidly become lethal and amplify. Air thick with viral load
from infected farms is carried for kilometers, while integrated trade
networks spread the disease through many carriers: live birds, day-old
chicks, meat, feathers, hatching eggs, eggs, chicken manure and animal
feed. (2)
"Everyone is focused on migratory birds and backyard chickens as the
problem," says Devlin Kuyek of GRAIN. "But they are not effective vectors
of highly pathogenic bird flu. The virus kills them, but is unlikely to be
spread by them."
For example, in Malaysia, the mortality rate from H5N1 among village
chickens is only 5 per cent, indicating that the virus has a hard time
spreading among small scale chicken flocks. H5N1 outbreaks in Laos, which
is surrounded by infected countries, have only occurred in the nation's few
factory farms, which are supplied by Thai hatcheries. The only cases of
bird flu in backyard poultry, which account for over 90 per cent of Laos'
production, occurred next to the factory farms.
"The evidence we see over and over again, from the Netherlands in 2003 to
Japan in 2004 to Egypt in 2006, is that lethal bird flu breaks out in large
scale industrial chicken farms and then spreads," Kuyek explains.
The Nigerian outbreak earlier this year [2006] began at a single factory
farm, owned by a cabinet minister, distant from hotspots for migratory
birds but known for importing unregulated hatchable eggs. In India, local
authorities say that H5N1 emerged and spread from a factory farm owned by
the country's largest poultry company, Venkateshwara Hatcheries.
A burning question is why governments and international agencies, like the
UN Food and Agriculture Organization, are doing nothing to investigate how
the factory farms and their byproducts, such as animal feed and manure,
spread the virus. Instead, they are using the crisis as an opportunity to
further industrialize the poultry sector. Initiatives are multiplying to
ban outdoor poultry, squeeze out small producers and restock farms with
genetically-modified chickens. The web of complicity with an industry
engaged in a string of denials and cover-ups seems complete.
"Farmers are losing their livelihoods, native chickens are being wiped out,
and some experts say that we're on the verge of a human pandemic that could
kill millions of people," Kuyek concludes. "When will governments realize
that to protect poultry and people from bird flu, we need to protect them
from the global poultry industry?"

Import bans are overreaction to bird flu
----------------------------------------
Countries that are banning imports of poultry from bird flu-affected areas
are overreacting, because the meat is safe to eat, an international animal
health group said on Monday [27 Feb 2006]. And while wild birds may play a
role in spreading the virus, they are not the key to controlling its
spread, said Alex Thiermann, president of the standard-setting committee
for the World Animal Health Organization. Thiermann said sensible
precautions, such as quickly culling birds in affected areas, can work to
control outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza. "Countries have far exceeded
what is science-based, and they have further complicated the losses to the
industry," Thiermann told the New-Fields' Bird Flu Summit, a meeting of
avian influenza experts. "Eating chicken is not what is going to kill you."
French trade minister Christine Lagarde said 20 countries had imposed curbs
on imports of French poultry after an outbreak of H5N1 at a turkey farm in
the east of the country last week. The World Health Organization stressed
again on Monday [27 Feb 2006] that properly cooked poultry does not spread
bird flu. No one seems to have become infected merely through handling
chicken meat, WHO added. But poultry sales have plunged, and many countries
have moved to block imports as the virus spreads among flocks. As many as
19 new countries have reported outbreaks in birds over the past month. "A
lot has to do with the trust level between the public and government,"
Thiermann said.
Thiermann said countries were now beginning to respond in the proper
manner, doing the right surveillance to watch the virus as soon as it
begins to infect birds, culling poultry right away and sealing off the
movement of poultry within affected areas. "A timely response and proper
resources in 2004 would have reduced the pandemic risk," Thiermann said.
"Culling or stamping out is the number one measure to be taken. The tools
are available."
Watching wild birds for signs of the virus is important, but it would be
impossible to try to control the spreading virus in wildfowl, Thiermann
said. "Once the disease gets into a country, it really doesn't matter
whether it is carried by wildlife, because it is going to get into the
poultry," he said. Mute swans have been the latest sentinels in Europe, he
said, and there is some evidence that wild mallards may be carrying the
virus. But control has to take place in poultry. Developing countries are
more at risk than richer nations, because they lack a good veterinary
system, Thiermann said.
"We must improve the veterinary infrastructure," he said. "We can look at
Croatia, Romania, Japan, Malaysia and South Korea as good examples," he
added. "We can look at Nigeria, at Indonesia and other places where we see
existing problems, in my opinion, having to do with lack of veterinary
infrastructure."
