Poland, for the 1st time this year [2021], confirmed an outbreak of African swine fever (ASF) in domestic pigs.

The Veterinary Authority confirmed the outbreak on a farm in the Swiebodzin district of the Lubusz Voivodeship, just about 60 km [37.3 mi] from the German-Polish border. The direct distance to Frankfurt an der Oder is about 80 km [49.7 mi]. A breeding sow herd with almost 16 000 animals is affected. This is the 2nd largest outbreak since ASF was 1st detected in Poland in 2014. According to media reports, there is concern that the disease could have reached other farms via piglets.

Meanwhile, ASF continues to rage unabated in the Polish wild boar population. According to the official information, a total of 86 new finds with a total of 163 animals were recorded in the past week. From a German point of view, the problem is that 60 of the most recently confirmed carcass finds are from Lebus, which is close to the border. The number of infected wild boar has risen to a total of 748 confirmed cases since the beginning of 2021.

[Since the penetration of ASF from western Poland to eastern Germany in September 2020, and as of 11 Mar 2021, a total of 812 wild boar have been confirmed infected in Germany and officially reported, of which 751 were in the German state of Brandenburg and 61 in Saxony.

The said details and additional updated information, in particular addressing the distribution of the disease (with maps) and control measures undertaken, including fencing, were presented by the German representative during the 15-16 Mar 2021 meeting of EU's Animal Health - Regulatory Committee in Brussels (https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/reg-com_ahw_20210315_pres_asf_deu.pdf). So far, the disease in Germany has been restricted to wild boar; no introductions of the virus into domestic pig farms have been reported.

Poland's update, presented during the same meeting, is available at https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/reg-com_ahw_20210315_pres_asf_pol.pdf.

Other member countries presenting their respective ASF situation were Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Romania, and Slovakia. Another presentation was delivered by the EC, titled "Strategic approach and regionalization;" all are linked at https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/health/regulatory_committee/presentations_en#20210315. - Mod.AS
