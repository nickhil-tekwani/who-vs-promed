Novel coronavirus infection - update - 15 May 2013
--------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia has informed WHO of an additional 2 laboratory-confirmed cases with infection of the novel coronavirus (nCoV).

The 2 patients are healthcare workers who were exposed to patients with confirmed nCoV. The 1st patient is a 45-year-old man who became ill on [2 May 2013] and is currently in a critical condition. The 2nd patient is a 43-year-old woman with a coexisting health condition, who became ill on [8 May 2013] and is in a stable condition.

Although healthcare associated transmission has been observed before with nCoV (in Jordan in April 2012), this is the 1st time healthcare workers have been diagnosed with nCoV infection after exposure to patients. Healthcare facilities that provide care for patients with suspected nCoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients and healthcare workers. Healthcare facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC).

Since the beginning of May 2013 to date [15 May 2013], a total of 21 patients, including 9 deaths, have been reported from the outbreak primarily linked to a healthcare facility in the Eastern part of Saudi Arabia. The government is conducting ongoing investigation into the outbreak.

From September 2012 to date [15 May 2013], WHO has been informed of a global total of 40 laboratory confirmed cases of human infection with nCoV, including 20 deaths from 6 countries (France, Germany, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom).

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Healthcare providers are advised to be vigilant among recent travelers returning from areas affected by the virus who develop severe SARI. Specimens from patients' lower respiratory tracts should be obtained for diagnosis where possible. Clinicians are reminded that nCoV infection should be considered even with atypical signs and symptoms in patients who are significantly immune compromised.

All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with nCoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

WHO continues to closely monitor the situation.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp

[This WHO report provides much of the information ProMED-mail requested in the earlier post announcing the 2 additional cases. These are the 1st healthcare workers that have been infected with the nCoV with transmission presumably occurring in the healthcare setting since the outbreak in the Jordan ICU (see Novel coronavirus - Saudi Arabia (04): RFI, Jordan, April 2012 20120925.1308001 and Novel coronavirus - Eastern Mediterranean: WHO, Jordan, conf., RFI 20121130.1432498 for more details).

ProMED-mail would be very interested to see (and share) results of the epidemiologic investigations into this current healthcare facility based cluster -- the route(s) of transmission, location of transmission. Earlier press reports suggested there may have been transmission associated with a dialysis center, but there hasn't been confirmation of that. One wonders if there has been the phenomenon of the "super spreader" as seen during the SARS outbreak that was in common environments. Types of co-morbidities of the cases -- diseases associated with immunocompromise, other types of chronic or sub-acute illnesses. As mentioned in previous posts, it appears as though the majority of cases of SARI associated with the nCoV infection have had a history of pre-existing illnesses that put these individuals into high risk groups for serious complications with infectious diseases, especially respiratory (such as influenza, and in this case a coronavirus).
