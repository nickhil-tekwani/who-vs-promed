[Mongolia reported to the OIE 2 FMD epizootics in 2013. One (2 foci), in western Mongolia caused by FMDV serotype A, had reportedly started on 4 Jul 2013 and was declared resolved on 6 Sep 2013. The 2nd epizootic, located at the eastern part of the country (one single focus) similarly caused by serotype A, reportedly started on 18 Sep 2013 and was declared resolved on 28 Oct 2013. A new epizootic has been notified to the OIE on 1 Feb 2014; it reportedly started on 26 Jan 2014, involving 3 cattle holdings in the southeast, similarly caused by FMDV serotype A. With the added 11 new outbreaks, spreading westwards, as notified in the current follow-up report, the total number of outbreaks in southeast Mongolia has now become 14. Their locations are presented in the interactive OIE map at http://tinyurl.com/pma58pd (click on the cluster, zoom in for the province names to appear).

On 28 Oct 2013, 3 samples from Mongolian cattle -- date of their collection given as 1 Sep 2013 -- were received at the WRLFMD (Pirbright) and subsequently identified as FMDV serotype A, topotype ASIA, genotype/strain Sea-97 (Report date 8 Nov 2013,
Batch WRLFMD/2013/00020, http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2013/WRLFMD-2013-00020%20A%20Mongolia%202013.pdf.

The place of collection was not given and cannot be extrapolated from the given date. It will be useful to note whether the current epizootic is caused by the same strain; in a previous report, it was stated that samples have been sent.

Information on the virus strain included in the vaccine applied for mass vaccination in the 3 southeastern Mongolian provinces (almost 2 million cattle) as specified in the report, and about its observed rate of efficacy, will be of value, particularly for other countries at risk in the region. - Mod.AS
