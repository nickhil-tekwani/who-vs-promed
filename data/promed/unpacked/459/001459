More than 100 cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome have been reported in Lima and several other regions of the country, prompting the Health Ministry to issue a 90-day emergency health warning and increase the health services budget to cover treatment.

There are 3 fatal cases, 2 in Piura and one in Trujillo on the north coast. The National Institute of Neurological Sciences reported that the current cases show unusual and atypical features that require rapid and immediate treatment.

According to the minister of health, Zulema Tomas, the report of cases is usual at this time of year when cases of influenza and bronchial infections increase. In 2018, the Health Ministry reported 205 cases. Tomas said up to 300 cases may be expected this year [2019].

Guillain-Barre syndrome, GBS, is a rare but serious autoimmune disorder that attacks the peripheral nervous system and leads to weakness, tingling, and numbness, initially in the limbs and expanding to the rest of the body, and can eventually cause paralysis.

Although the precise cause of the disease is unknown, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, people who develop GBS do so several days or weeks after they have been sick with diarrhea or a respiratory illness. Although rare, some may develop the symptoms days or weeks after getting a vaccination.

Treatment consists of cleaning or immunizing the blood, according to Dr. Hugo Umeres of the Neurological Service at the Cayetano Heredia university hospital. One of the treatments is plasmapheresis, a procedure that removes the plasma from the blood and replaces it with other fluids. The treatment can cost up to [USD] 15 000, but the increased budget will allow all state hospitals to provide free treatment for GBS cases.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), symptoms last a few weeks, and most cases recover without any serious or long-term complications.

The Health Ministry has emphasized that GBS is not contagious. It is a virus, and the best prevention is to wash hands frequently, avoid street food, and treat respiratory diseases promptly.

Peru has declared a health emergency in 5 regions, including Lima, after the deaths of at least 4 people linked to Guillain-Barre syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that attacks the nervous system.

Health minister Zulema Tomas said Sunday [9 Jun 2019] that in addition to the deaths there were currently 206 cases of the disease.

"We have an outbreak; there has been a brusque increase" since 5 Jun [2019], Tomas said on state-run TV Peru, adding that health authorities were taking steps to control and contain the disease.

While the syndrome is not contagious, a 90-day health emergency was declared because the current cases "have unusual and atypical characteristics that require rapid or immediate initial treatment," Peru's Institute of Neurological Sciences said.

The precise cause of the disorder is unknown, but most cases develop after a person has been sick with diarrhea or a respiratory infection.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US says its research suggests that the syndrome is "strongly associated" with the Zika virus, a mosquito-borne illness.

The regions affected by GBS include 3 on the country's northern coast -- Piura, Lambayeque, La Libertad -- tourist destinations known for their archaeological sites and beaches. Also included was the central region of Junin and Lima, which has 9 million inhabitants.

There are 2 deaths reported in Piura, one in La Libertad, and another in Junin.

[Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) can occur following infections. GBS has also been reported following Zika virus infections in other localities. A report in 2018 described a 2-year clinical course of Zika virus infection-related GBS. In that study, clinical and demographic characteristics of the 18 patients infected during the Colombian Zika epidemic with serologically diagnosed Zika infection with GBS are reported (see Zika virus (09): Americas, Asia, research, observations 20180909.6016422). No mention is made in the above report about the measures that will be used to contain the occurrence of GBS. - Mod.TY
