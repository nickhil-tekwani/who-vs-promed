A medical team of Liaquat Medical College and Hospital, Jamshoro/Hyderabad
comprising six doctors and two lab technicians has found no evidence of
viral disease in Thar.
A press release issued by LMC Hospital here on Monday aid that doctors team
had visited Thar on 16 Mar 2000 and observed that the causes of the
outbreak of disease in Thar were not viral infection but the root causes of
the disease were poverty, water shortage and bad weather.
The doctors team was of the opinion that the disease pattern was 80 to 90
percent pulmonary TB beside a few other cases of chronic non-communicable
diseases.
The press release said that samples for confirmation of the diagnosis were
taken by the team and the majority of cases confirmed that there was no
viral epidemic in Thar.
