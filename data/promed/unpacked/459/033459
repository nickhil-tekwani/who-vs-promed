No cases of infection or death of cattle from anthrax have been recorded in Azerbaijan since 2005, spokesman for the Agency for Agrarian Services under Azerbaijan's Agriculture Ministry Yolchu Khanvali told Trend. According to him, the epizootic situation in Azerbaijan associated with anthrax, as well as other infectious diseases of livestock, is currently stable.

Noting that the causative agents of ulcers can live in the soil for centuries [no, decades. - Mod.MHJ], Khanvali said that preventive measures are being taken regularly to prevent animals from becoming infected with this and other dangerous diseases.

He noted that 2 530 204 large-horned cattle, 7 185 984 small ruminants, 81 363 dry-grained [horses], 4105 pigs, and 320 camels were vaccinated against anthrax this year alone [2019. These are their usual numbers, more or less. - Mod.MHJ]

2 people have recently been diagnosed with anthrax in Azerbaijan's Sabirabad, one of whom passed away. According to statistics, 10 people were infected with anthrax in 2014, 9 in 2015, 10 in 2016, 6 in 2017, 9 in 2018, and 7 in 2019. Based on the available data, anthrax infections have not been fatal to this day.

[Azerbaijan has over many years had an active national vaccination programme, which keeps this disease at a sporadic level. But the regularity of human cases indicates that farm livestock outbreaks are being missed, and that key high-risk herds are not getting vaccinated until tagged by a human case associated with butchering a sick animal.

Sabirabad is in central Azerbaijan, which probably ensured its medical recognition. It might also indicate that this was a street market associated case with contaminated meat from a sick animal some distance from the town; see http://fallingrain.com/world/AJ/46/Sabirabad.html. - Mod.MHJ
