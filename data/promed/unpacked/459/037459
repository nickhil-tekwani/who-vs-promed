Foot-and-mouth disease spreads in Zambia
-----------------------------------------
An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] that was discovered last week
in Zambia's Southern Province has spread to various parts of the country,
threatening beef exports, an official said on Thursday [2 Sep 2004].
The disease, which usually kills cattle, is spreading quickly in the
Southern African country because of a lack of vaccines. [In fact, FMD will
kill mainly young stock, usually up to 50 percent of animals under 3
months; mortality in adult animals does not usually exceed 5-10 percent. -
Mod.AS]
Agriculture Ministry official Morrison Kunda told state radio that the
disease has spread to Central Province where 8000 animals have been
affected and close to 15 000 animals are likely to contract the disease.
Kunda said the government has now banned cattle movement from the Central
Province of Zambia, a few days after a similar ban was imposed in Southern
Province in an effort to curb the disease.
About 5000 animals have been affected by FMD in Southern Province and 18
000 are at risk.
Minister of Agriculture Mundia Sikatana on Monday said the spread of FMD is
threatening Zambia's beef exports to the European Union market. "We have
to move quickly in combating this disease or else we may face an export ban
from the EU market," Sikatana said.
The disease causes sores on the mouth and feet of the animal.
