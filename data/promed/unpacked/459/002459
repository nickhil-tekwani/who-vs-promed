Bovine tuberculosis in school and petting zoos
Spotted deer [_Axis axis_] from Hamat Gader have been found tuberculosis positive in 5 rural school zoos throughout northern Israel. This is in addition to the first outbreak detected in Kiryat Motzkin [see comment]. In some of the affected locations, dairy cattle operations are maintained. About 75% of the deer originating in Hamat Gader have been found infected.

[The previous weekly report of Hachaklait (No 29, 17 Jul 2021) included the following information:
"The vet practitioner Dr Assis has reported morbidity in spotted deer in the zoo ('Hai Park') of Kiryat Motzkin (map at <tinyurl.com/254z7tyn>). The autopsy findings were confirmed positive for bovine tuberculosis. The deer were bought from Hamat Gader's 'mini safari' when it was closed down, its animals sold.

"According to a report by the director of the State Field Veterinary Services, the 11 deer which remained unsold in the liquidised mini safari were killed; all presented lesions typical of tuberculosis. Deer from this facility had been moved earlier to several rural school-zoos (see report No 30 above).

"Following these findings, tuberculin tests will soon be conducted in dairy farms in the southern Golan Heights and in the Jordan Valley".

A visit to the website of the Hamat Gader recreation facility reveals that the mini safari and petting zoo of this recreation centre (south-east to the Lake of Tiberias; see map above) kept, previous to their apparent closure, an unspecified number of other animals on top of the several dozens spotted deer. This included "bunnies, hamsters, ferrets, goats and ibex". Tracing back all the released animals cooperatively by the veterinary and public health authorities is ongoing. Details on their findings are expected.

Hamat Gader's mini safari's role as potential source of earlier infections in cattle and a goat in northern Israel (see 20190403.6402973, 20210314.8246025, 20210508.8351900) deserves to be investigated. Bovine tuberculosis had been eradicated from Israel decades earlier.

The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged zoos, petting zoos and alike seriously in many countries, leading, in some cases, to their temporary or final closures. The current event should serve as a reminder of the essential need to maintain continuous, effective veterinary control upon such facilities, where the public, and in particular children, might get exposed to zoonoic disease agents. - Mod.AS.]
