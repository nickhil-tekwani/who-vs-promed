In the southern part of Rio Grande do Sul state, where peach cultivation is concentrated, a syndrome that causes the death of trees worries growers. Losses could reach 40% for the next harvest. This is the worst scenario in the last 15 years. The early death syndrome of peach trees requires removal of affected branches, but often also the elimination of the whole orchard.

The syndrome was first detected in the 1970s, but has become more severe recently. Its effects can vary between orchards, depending on the depth of soil, crop cultivars, age of the orchard, as well as the altitude. It is difficult to estimate the total damage because trees may be totally or partially dead; only some branches may be affected; and some trees show only very mild symptoms.

[Early death (or 'peach tree short life'; PTSL) syndrome of peach has been reported from the Americas for several decades. It is due to a number of pathogens as well as environmental factors. Ring nematode (_Mesocriconema xenoplax_) has been identified as critical to predispose trees, followed by fungal (such as _Cytospora_ spp.) and bacterial cankers. Finally, trees suddenly collapse in spring, with their death thought to be frequently due to bacterial canker (_Pseudomonas_ spp.) and environmental stress, such as cold injuries or poor cultural practices. Development of tolerant or resistant crop varieties or root stocks is hampered by a lack of selection criteria due to the multiple factors and their potential, still largely unknown interactions.

The syndrome appears to be associated with long term monocultures of stone fruit, similar to the general decline of citrus health in India and its region (e.g., see ProMED post 20201221.8036796). Combinations of various pathogens accumulating in monocultures, such as old orchards, over time are known to contribute to the general decline of plant health, as well as weakening plants by being detrimental to healthy root and soil microbiomes.
