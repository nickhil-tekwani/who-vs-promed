Pakistani media report the 5th death due to the brain-eating amoeba, _Naegleria fowleri_ in the past month. In 2014, some 14 people died due to contracting the lethal parasite in the country.

_Naegleria fowleri_ (commonly referred to as the "brain-eating amoeba"), is a microscopic amoeba which is a single-celled living organism. It can cause a rare and devastating infection of the brain called primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). The amoeba is commonly found in warm freshwater such as lakes, rivers, ponds and canals.

Infections can happen when contaminated water enters the body through the nose. Once the amoeba enters the nose, it travels to the brain where it causes PAM (which destroys brain tissue) and is usually fatal. Infections usually occur when it is hot for prolonged periods of time, which results in higher water temperatures and lower water levels.

_Naegleria fowleri_ infections are rare. Most infections occur from exposure to contaminated recreational water. Cases due to the use of neti pots and the practice of ablution have been documented. You cannot be infected with _Naegleria fowleri_ by drinking contaminated water, and the amoeba is not found in salt water.

Initial symptoms of PAM usually start within 1-7 days after infection. The initial symptoms may include headache, fever, nausea, or vomiting. Other symptoms can include stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, seizures, and hallucinations. After the start of symptoms, the disease progresses rapidly.

[Please see our comment below in the ProMED-mail post from 3 Sep 2014 (Amebic meningoencephalitis, primary - Pakistan (03): 20140903.2746573):

"Primary amebic meningoencephalitis is rare, and the reports of 9 cases within a short period is unusual. In the ProMED-mail posting from 24 Aug 2014, we pointed to the religious rite of ablution included in Yogic, Ayurvedic, and Islamic traditions. Within the Islamic faith, ritual nasal rinsing is included in a cleansing process called wudu, or ablution. It is usually performed several times a day in preparation for prayer. The parasite has also been contracted via the use of neti pots. These practices, where water is introduced into the sinuses, is an obvious route of infection with _Naegleria fowleri_."

These special rites are the most plausible source of the high number of primary amebic meningoencephalitis cases in Pakistan. The public should be informed that water used for these rites should be boiled before use, which will eliminate free living amoeba, including _Naegleria fowleri_. - Mod.EP
