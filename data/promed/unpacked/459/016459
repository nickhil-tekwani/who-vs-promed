NIAID-Supported Researchers Isolate Bacterium That Causes
Potentially Deadly Tick-Borne Disease
Researchers supported by the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases (NIAID) have successfully isolated the organism that
causes human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE), a newly recognized and
sometimes fatal infection transmitted to people by ticks.
Jesse L. Goodman, M.D., of the University of Minnesota and his
colleagues are the first researchers to grow the yet-unnamed bacterium in
laboratory cell cultures, using blood from patients with HGE. They report
their findings in the Jan. 25, 1996 issue of The New England Journal of
Medicine.
"Little is known about the agent that causes HGE, because until
recently we have been unable to grow this intracellular pathogen in the
laboratory," says Dr. Goodman. "Now that this bacterium has been isolated
from patients, we can develop improved diagnostic tools and treatments, as
well as better understand the biology and epidemiology of this emerging
infection."
"As has been the case with other emerging diseases such as Lyme
disease, NIAID-supported investigators have worked quickly to understand
HGE, building on our long-standing investment in fundamental biomedical
research," says Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., NIAID director.
HGE was first described in 1994 in patients in Minnesota and
Wisconsin. Subsequently, cases have been reported in California, Florida,
Maryland, Massachusetts and New York. Several dozen cases have been
reported in the scientific literature, but the true prevalence of the
disease is probably much higher, says Dr. Goodman.
HGE appears to be transmitted by deer ticks, which also can
transmit Lyme disease. It has been suggested that HGE may also be
transmitted by dog ticks. Physicians have observed patients infected
by two or more tick-borne infections at once, which can make diagnosis
and treatment decisions difficult.
"A diagnosis of HGE may be missed when there is simultaneous
infection with the Lyme bacterium, which usually causes a rash that is
not typically seen in people with HGE," says Dr. Goodman. "In such cases,
patients may receive treatment for Lyme disease such as amoxicillin that
is not effective against HGE. The emergence of HGE makes it critical
that physicians consider this infection in the differential diagnosis of
an acute illness with fever occurring after a possible tick exposure."
The HGE bacterium is closely related to bacteria of the genus
Ehrlichia, including E. chaffeensis, which causes a human disease (ehrlichio
sis) that is similar to HGE. Ehrlichiosis was first observed in humans in
1986, and E. chaffeensis was isolated in 1991. Other Ehrlichia cause
diseases in dogs, horses, sheep and cattle.
Ehrlichia grow inside of cells; the HGE bacterium grows inside
immune system cells called granulocytes, while E. chaffeensis favors
different immune system cells called monocytes.
Signs and symptoms of both HGE and ehrlichiosis due to E.
chaffeensis are similar. They include fever, chills, headaches, muscle
aches, nausea and vomiting. Laboratory findings often include elevated
liver enzymes, and a decrease in a patient's blood platelets and white
blood cells. Both diseases typically last one to two weeks, and most
patients who receive treatment recover without long-lasting complications.
However, a small proportion of patients with HGE or ehrlichiosis due to
E. chaffeensis may suffer more severe symptoms, such as kidney failure,
respiratory problems or meningitis. The case-fatality rate for both
diseases may be as high as 5 percent. Severe infections and death are
most likely in older people, and in those who are not promptly treated.
HGE and disease caused by E. chaffeensis are generally treated with a
minimum seven-day course of tetracycline or doxycycline.
Because of the rise in tick-borne infections, including Lyme
disease, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and diseases due to Ehrlichia such as
HGE, avoiding exposure to ticks is important. In an editorial in the same
issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, William Schaffner, M.D., of
Vanderbilt University, and Steven M. Standaert, M.D., of the Association
pour l'Aide a la Medecine Preventive (France), write, "The use of insect
repellents reduces the risk of infection. Other precautions that discourage
the attachment and feeding of ticks, such as the wearing of light-colored
clothing, long pants and long-sleeved shirts, and thorough examination of
the skin after walking in the woods or fields may also be helpful."
Dr. Goodman's co-authors include Curtis Nelson, B.A., Timothy J.
Kurtti, Ph.D., and Ulrike G. Munderloh, D.V.M., Ph.D., of the University of
Minnesota; Blaise Vitale, M.D., of the Grantsburg Clinic, Grantsburg, Wis.;
John E. Madigan, D.V.M., of the University of California, Davis; and J.
Stephen Dumler, M.D., of the University of Maryland School of Medicine,
Baltimore.
The research by Dr. Goodman and colleagues is supported as part of
NIAID's comprehensive research agenda to enhance the nation's ability to
detect and control emerging microbes such as HGE. The goals of this agenda
are to:

1) Develop a research and training infrastructure capable of responding
expeditiously to infectious disease emergencies.
2) Expand basic and applied research on ecologic and environmental
factors influencing emergence.
3) Expand basic and applied research on microbial changes and
adaptations influencing emergence.
4) Expand basic and applied research on host interactions with emerging
pathogens.
5) Support development and testing of control strategies for specific
diseases with potential for emergence.

NIAID is a component of the National Institutes of Health. NIAID
conducts and supports research aimed at preventing, diagnosing and
treating illnesses such as AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases,
tuberculosis, asthma and allergies. NIH is an agency of the U.S. Public
Health Service, part of the Department of Health and Human Services.
