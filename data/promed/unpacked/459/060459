Rabies, transmitted by the bite of infected bats or dogs, has caused
the deaths of at least 20 people this year [2011] in Peru, which led
to the announcement of a campaign to combat the disease, said the
Ministry of Health. The Coordinator of the Zoonoses Health Strategies
of the Ministry of Health, Ana Maria Navarro, stated rabies is fatal
if not treated in time, which has led to reinforced actions to combat
and eliminate the virus. She stated that the recognized cases are
urban transmitted by dogs and sylvan, which is found in [vampire]
bats.

The official indicated that nationally, some 60 000 people are treated
per year due to the risk of urban rabies. "Timely [medical] attention
is important because once symptoms appear the disease becomes fatal."

According to official figures, 19 of the deaths were natives of the
Amazonas region who were bitten by [vampire] bats with the disease
[virus]. "The Amazonas inhabitants are at risk, their houses do not
have walls, they do not use protection [bed nets?], and reject medical
assistance because they consider them to be outside of their customs,"
according to Peru state television.

"World Rabies Day" will be celebrated 28 Sep [2011] , within the scope
of which Peru announced a series of efforts to contain this health
problem.

[This report is a good reminder of the need to provide public
education at all levels of society where rabies exists, be it in urban
areas or in remote tropical forests. While rabies eradication in the
sylvatic vampire bat transmission cycle is not possible at this time,
control and prevention of human disease certainly is, although
logistically difficult in remote areas. Control of urban canine rabies
certainly is possible.

The well organized World Rabies Day makes an excellent effort each
year to bring this to the attention of health authorities and the
public around the world where rabies is a problem.
