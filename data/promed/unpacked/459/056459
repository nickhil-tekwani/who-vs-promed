[Between May and July 2018, Myanmar reported 28 outbreaks of FMDV serotype O. See event summary and updated map at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=26700.

The following information on Myanmar can be found in the September - 2019 European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) monthly report "Global Foot-and-Mouth Disease Situation".

"Following the outbreaks that were first reported in April 2018 due to FMDV serotype O, where the animals had contracted the infection due to contact with animals at grazing and watering points, a vaccination campaign was carried out in 28 villages of the administrative region of the Rakhine State with the inoculation of 4400 cattle. The type of vaccine used was not reported. Other preventive measures are still in place even if no new outbreaks have occurred. The topotypes detected by the WRLFMD belonging to the serotype responsible for the latest outbreaks are O/ME-SA/Ind-2001e, detected for the 1st time in the country, O/ME-SA/Ind-2001d, and O/SEA/Mya-98. These viruses were detected in the last samples collected that refer to 2017 and 2018."
