FOOD CONTAMINATION, SALMONELLA - USA (02)

A ProMED-mail post

Food contamination, Salmonella - USA 970923203224]

A Sep 23 ProMED-mail post reported a recall of fermented sausage in
Washington state, USA, due to Salmonella contamination. A moderator's
comment added to the posting suggested that this "seemed unlikely" due to
the typically low pH of fermented meat products, as well as the drying
process.
Actually, there is considerable evidence that Salmonellae can survive in
fermented meat products. I became aware of this issue during an outbreak of
_S. typhimurium_ here in Pennsylvania in 1995. In a three-month period we had
310 cases of _S. typhimurium_ (and another 30 cases of group B salmonellosis
not otherwise identified), approximately 3 times the expected number.
Patient descriptive data, a case-control study, and multiple positive food
samples linked the outbreak to a specific brand of Lebanon bologna. The
outbreak led to a recall of 250,000 kg. of sausage, distributed mostly in
Pennsylvania but also nationally. The U.S. Dept of Agriculture as well as
our state Dept of Agriculture were key co-investigators.

Lebanon bologna (named for a county in Pennsylvania, _not_ the Middle
Eastern country) is a traditional, semi-dry, fermented and wood-smoked beef
sausage produced primarily in southcentral Pennsylvania. It is closely
related to Thuringer and other "summer sausages" probably familiar to
European subscribers of ProMED-mail. The microbiologic safety of Lebanon
bologna (and similar products) depends on a combination of critical factors
including salt content, presence of curing agents (nitrate or nitrite),
smoke time and temperature, moisture content, and active fermentation
(lactic-acid-producing bacterial action) that lowers pH. Because the
product is not "cooked" to temperatures needed to kill microbes, and is
sold to the consumer as "ready-to-eat," it is important that all critical
factors be achieved.
We expect to publish the outbreak investigation eventually, and there are
on-going legal issues, so I will not try to explain in this forum what may
have gone wrong. Suffice it to say that not every sausage product may be
prepared with adequate pH, salt, moisture, nitrate/nitrite, and (if smoked)
smoke exposure. Alternatively, some Salmonellae may survive in acid or
other hostile conditions better than one might expect, especially if fat
protects the microbes or they are "acid tolerant". Also, high initial
numbers of Salmonellae in meat may, despite "adequate" 5-fold reduction in
bacterial counts after processing, still result in an infective dose in the
"ready-to-eat" finished product.
My sense of the literature is that those sausage products processed for
longer times and with less final water content are more likely to achieve
adequate killing of pathogenic microbes (such as _E.coli_ and Salmonella),
but even hard sausage and pepperoni products are not always safe. I append
a few references as evidence to correct the moderator's suggestion that
survival of Salmonellae in sausage is "unlikely."

Mea culpa!
Obviously, I stand corrected and my comment was ill-considered. Readers
should note, however, that I am NOT a ProMED-mail moderator, simply a
worker-in-the-fields sending in posts.
Dr. Weltman's detailed comments are foreboding for a variety of reasons.
Pathogenic, rumen- and stomach-oriented strains of coliforms (_E. coli_
O157:H7, _S. typhimurium- DT104, etc.) are breaching traditional processing
hurdles of:
1. Strong competition from traditional food safety bacteria (lactic-acid),
since the rumen-oriented strains are both acid-tolerant and
antibiotic-resistant.
2. The new strains are salt-tolerant.
3. The new stains are also good survivors of other typical barriers
(freezing, drying), as can be seen from recent outbreaks traceable to
alfalfa and radish seeds.
4. Virulence is markedly increased due to survival of stomach acid and
verotoxigenesis.
5. Infections are basically untreatable due to strong antibiotic-resistance
and infections are much more damaging than those from normal strains.
Particularly troubling is Dr. Weltman's reference to a Salmonella outbreak
traceable to prosciutto ham. This traditional product depends solely on
dryness and salt content to inhibit spoilage and pathogens.
Historically, food safety has been assured by either inhibition of growth
(so less than infectious doses are present) or pasteurization (so that
numbers of pathogens could be reduced below infectious doses).
Now the situation is that the hardiness and virulence of new pathogenic
strains are such that their mere occurrence is a significant health risk.
