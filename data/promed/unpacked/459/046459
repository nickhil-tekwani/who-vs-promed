Apparently the rainy season currently has made the season suitable
for mosquitoes laying eggs and producing larvae.

In the Pesawahan village, Rawalo, Banyumas, Central Java, dozens of
people have been afflicted with chikungunya illness. The illness
[virus] that was transmitted by these mosquitoes attacked the
residents in 2 territories, that is RW V and RW VI. Within 2 weeks,
this outbreak attacked the residents of 2 of RW (neighbourhoods,ed).

From the available data in the Rawalo Community Health Centre,
approximately 50 people were recorded as having been affected by
chikungunya [virus]. According to the latest information, 5 people
were still being treated in the Community Health Centre. According to
one of the chikungunya [virus infection] affected residents, the
signs of the illness began to be felt by a resident since last
Saturday [15 Nov 2008].

After that, dozens of other residents at once fell ill and went to
the Community Health Centre or were treated in their houses.

The head of the Rawalo Community Health Centre, Dr Hendro Harjito,
when being interviewed in his office, said, the Rawalo Community
Health Centre's integrated team and Dinkes (Health Service,ed)
Kabupaten Banyumas have entered the location of the chikungunya outbreak.

They immediately collected data on all the residents affected by this
illness. The plan tomorrow (today [19 Nov 2008]) will be to carry out
fogging or spraying of the mosquitoes breeding sites all over the
Pesawahan Village territory, he added.

He acknowledged that this is the 1st time that chikungunya [virus]
has occurred in the area. "Our area is not endemic for chikungunya or
dengue fever [viruses]. We suspected that this illness [virus] was
brought in by one of the residents from outside the village, because
of our findings. This was the 1st extraordinary incident (KLB)
[health emergency] in our territory," he explained.

In the meantime, Pesawahan villagers are worried that the chikungunya
[virus] outbreak will spread. "We worried that the outbreak of this
illness will spread to several villages bordering the location of the
outbreak of this illness, said Mukhrodin.

He hoped, that there would be real action from Dinkes (Health
Service,ed) Banyumas to control the chikungunya outbreak in the
Pesawahan Village because the chikungunya [virus] spread is easy,
through the bites of [chikungunya virus infected] mosquitoes.
