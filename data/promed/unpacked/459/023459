The Ministry of Health published today [Sun 1 May 2022] the findings of the audit conducted at the Strauss Elite plant in Nof Hagalil (previously, 'Upper Nazareth') following the _Salmonella_ affair.

Among other things, during the audit, a failure was found in the thawing process of milk fat, which is not being performed according to the manufacturer's thawing and storage instructions, a potential cause of contamination. In addition, it was discovered that the professional team of quality control at the plant has been replaced in the last year and that the position of food safety manager is temporarily unmanned, indicating that the quality control and safety system of the plant are deficient.

The ministry reports that out of about 300 samples taken so far from the plant's production line, from raw materials, and from end products, about 30 were found positive for _Salmonella_. The positive samples were transferred to the National _Salmonella_ Center in the Public Health Laboratory of the Ministry of Health, to determine the type of bacterium. In 14 samples, the bacterium in the culture was found to be _Salmonella enterica_ serotype S.16:1,v:-, different from that found in Belgium. However, the possible presence of another strain of _Salmonella_ cannot be ruled out.

According to the most recent daily update on _Salmonella_, 21 cases with an alleged epidemiological connection to the chocolate event have been reported so far. Cultures were obtained from 16 of the patients, results are expected in the coming days. Apparently, at this stage, these numbers do not appear exceptional and do not indicate a widespread outbreak.

During the audit, the plant updated that a few weeks ago there was an intrusion of pigeons into the production site. The issue was addressed immediately, including the assistance of an exterminator, but the plant was required to check whether the penetration of the birds had affected the safety of the product.

In addition, it turned out that a customer of the factory reported values of _Salmonella_ indicators which were higher than permitted in the chocolate liquid. The complaint was not handled by the factory as required and no additional tests were performed.

The Ministry of Health stated that "according to the results of the tests conducted so far, a connection between the chocolate incident in Belgium and the incident in Israel has been ruled out. It should be noted that information available to the Ministry of Health, the type of _Salmonella_ involved is known to cause disease in humans but is not known as a violent strain."

[ProMED thanks Nati Elkin for this submission. The designation S16 usually refers to _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Schwarzengrund (_S._ Schwarzengrund). It is still not confirmed that the human cases are related to the same serotype. - Mod.LL
