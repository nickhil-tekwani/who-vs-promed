Due to an outbreak of bovine paralytic rabies in Tamaulipas state at the border with San Luis Potosi state, cattle raisers have requested additional resources from SAGARPA [Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development Fisheries and Food] for subsidized purchase of 350 000 doses of [rabies] vaccine in order to be ready in case of a contingency.

For the moment, the situation is not so serious in the Huasteca area [parts of the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Puebla, Hidalgo, San Luis Potosi, Queretaro, and Guanajuato], but it is necessary to continue [vaccination and surveillance] to avoid problems because the situation is difficult in Ciudad Mante, Xicotencatl, Gonzalez, Aldama, and Soto la Marina [Tamaulipas state] where, according to statistics, more than 2000 head of cattle have died of rabies.

The problem emerged due to the presence of hematophagous bats [vampires, _Desmodus rotundus_] in the south of Tamaulipas state. Although for the moment this does not represent a problem in the Huasteca region, cattle producers have been requested to be alert for any rabies cases in the area.

[The virus causing bovine paralytic rabies is transmitted by _Desmodus rotundus_, the most common vampire bat in the tropics and sub-tropics in the Americas.

The deaths of more than 2000 head of cattle from vampire-bat transmitted rabies in Tamaulipas state indeed represents a significant economic loss. Unfortunately, the report does not indicate over what period of time these losses occurred. ProMED-mail posted an earlier report of bovine paralytic rabies in January 2012 (see archive no. 20120114.1010901). The losses are unnecessary, in that they could have been prevented by timely vaccination in a campaign similar to that being undertaken by the cattle producers in the Huasteca region, where 85 percent of the cattle population has already been immunized.
