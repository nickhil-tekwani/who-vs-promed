While the authorities currently seem to be doing their best to contain the situation at Hwange National Park, where over 90 elephants were massacred by poachers, with the number likely to rise, people still have many questions that need some answers.

However, there is need to mention that from the look of things, the Government of Zimbabwe is not taking lightly the ruthless and senseless killing of elephants at the country's biggest game reserve, which also resulted in the death of other animals, especially meat-eating ones.

In one of many recent visits by officials to the crime scene, a total of 7 ministers (Environment minister Saviour Kasukuwere, Defence minister Sydney Sekeramayi, Health minister David Parirenyatwa, Agriculture minister Joseph Made, Local Government minister Ignatius Chombo, Information minister Jonathan Moyo and Mines minister Walter Chidhakwa) on 29 Sep 2013 took a trip to Hwange National Park. The purpose of the trip was to ascertain the damage and craft the way forward in a bid to stop the continuance of similar incidences.

According to figures supplied by officials from the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Authority (ZimParks) during the visit, besides the elephants that died, the cyanide poison had also led to the deaths of 2 buffaloes, one giraffe, one kudu, one lion, 2 painted dogs and many vultures by Sunday last week.

It was agreed the carcasses of the dead animals would be burnt while Ferrous Phosphate, an iron salt of phosphoric acid, would be used in decontaminating the poisoned water and soil. The poachers spread cyanide over salt pans, also known as salt licks (salt deposits that animals regularly lick) around water holes. There are currently a total of 35 salt licks that are known to have been poisoned.

The fact that the poachers chose to use cyanide, which is deadly, and not rifles as they have normally done in the past, shows that there is a new, determined breed of poacher who is worried about nothing else except making money.

According to reports from ZimParks, cooking utensils were found inside Hwange National Park at a place where the poachers had clearly been camping while they carried out their brutal operation.

While it could not be ascertained how long the poachers had been camping in the park, it was clear they got comfortable enough to set up camp, causing many to wonder where the rangers were while this was happening. Were they not supposed to be manning the place?

ZimParks says the reason why this catastrophe has occurred is because they are under-funded and quite overwhelmed. Lack of sufficient manpower and equipment required to run the park efficiently were cited as the main challenges.

Hwange National Park, the largest game reserve in the country and 3rd largest in Africa, stretches for 14 651 square metres. ZimParks officials said such a huge national park would ideally require at least 700 rangers. Hwange National Park only has 145. While 120 field rangers are required in the anti-poaching department, only 43 are available. As a result, while ideally one ranger should cover a 20-km area, each of them is expected to cover 200 km on foot and without food rations.

The unavailability of water in some parts of the park and the erratic fuel supplies are also said to be a hindrance to smooth operations. The lack of external support was also cited as a contributing factor, as aerial and research services are now non-existent. This has been blamed by the officials on the "west-imposed sanctions."

Having heard all the troubles ZimParks is facing to effectively run the game reserve, it is not surprising that poachers can get in and have their way as they did. But now that this was allowed to happen, what are the measures being put in place to ensure that it does not recur, many might want to know.

The recently appointed Environment minister Saviour Kasukuwere reiterated his declaration of war on poachers and expressed determination to protect the country's wildlife. "We are determined to protect our wildlife, and that is why we are here," said Kasukuwere during the visit to Hwange National Park.

Kasukuwere acknowledged that there is a need to make some changes at the national park, changes that will obviously require money. He appealed for help from well-wishers.

It still remains to be seen whether the problems that led to the catastrophe will be dealt with. One thing is for certain: As long as conditions remain the way they are at Hwange National Park, this will not be the worst we will seen.

A man believed to have supplied poachers with the deadly cyanide which has killed nearly 100 elephants and devastated the ecological system at Hwange National Park has appeared in court.

Prosecutors say between October and November last year [2013], Elvis Ncube, 30, of Hillside in Harare, acquired 3 tonnes of sodium cyanide and stored it at his place of residence, a Bulawayo court heard.

He allegedly sold the chemical to different unnamed individuals, including the poaching syndicate, who went on to mix it with salt and poison water sources at Hwange National Park.

Ncube, who is charged with storing classified hazardous substances at unlicensed premises, was remanded on 16 Oct 2013 on USD 100 bail by magistrate Gladmore Mushove.

Meanwhile, Justice Martin Makonese of the Bulawayo High Court on Friday [4 Oct 2013] threw out a bail appeal by 3 men charged over the elephant poisoning. Farai Chitsa, 34, a Bulawayo businessman and 2 brothers Sipho, 54, and Misheck Mafu, 46, will stand trial on 24 Oct 2013 for delivering or offering toxic substances and illegal possession of ivory.

Trial magistrates in Hwange heard how Chitsa paid the 2 brothers USD 900 to poison water sources with salt laced with cyanide, which has resulted in the death of 95 jumbos [elephants].

On 27 Aug 2013, game rangers at Hwange National Park got a tip-off that there were poachers in the game park, and a team was dispatched to investigate. The court was told that the team picked up footprints of the suspected poachers on 29 Aug 2013 and tracked them to Sipho's homestead. He allegedly admitted to killing 5 elephants and led the police to where he had hidden the tusks.

Sipho implicated his brother, Misheck, who upon arrest the following day, implicated Chitsa.

The court was told that investigators told Misheck to phone Chitsa, who was in Bulawayo on the pretext that he wanted to sell him some tusks, and Chitsa drove from Bulawayo to Pelandaba in Tsholotsho, where he was ambushed and arrested by rangers.

Clever Khumalo, 44, another member of the syndicate, recently appeared in court charged separately with Sipho Mafu on similar charges. The 2 were remanded in custody on Tuesday [1 Oct 2013?] this week on the particular case.

Three other poachers, Robert Maposa, 42, Thabani Zondo, 24, and Dedani Tshuma, 25, were recently jailed for 16 years, each for illegal possession of ivory and charges related to cyanide poisoning.

The 3 men must pay USD 600 000 restitution to the wildlife sanctuary, while Tshuma was also ordered to pay a further USD 200 000 by 31 Dec 2013 [this year].

Eight more elephant carcasses have been discovered in Hwange National Park in what is suspected to be a fresh case of cyanide poisoning.

According to latest reports, over 90 elephants have died of cyanide poisoning in the giant national park in what has been described as the worst poaching disaster in Zimbabwe's history.

Parks and Wildlife Management Authority public relations manager Ms Caroline Washaya Moyo yesterday [11 Oct 2013] said the carcasses recently discovered were barely a day old.

"Eight more carcasses have been discovered in Hwange National Park, and 7 dead vultures were also found. We suspect that this is a fresh case of poisoning. However, we cannot reveal more details as investigations into the matter are still in progress," she said.

Recently, 3 of the 8 poachers arrested for spawning the Hwange ecological disaster after poisoning water holes and salt pans with cyanide pellets were jailed for an effective 16 years each.

The poisoning killed over 87 elephants and an indeterminate number of other animals on the food chain.

Villagers from Chief Siphoso's area in Tsholotsho District confessed to making a living out of poisoning elephants with cyanide and resolved to give up the practice and work with authorities in conserving wildlife.

The villagers told a 7-member ministerial delegation led by Environment, Water and Climate Minister Saviour Kasukuwere at Pumula Village under Chief Siphoso that the break down of the Campfire Programme, council and parks services had led some of them to resort to poaching.

Pumula Village is about 87 km from Tsholotsho Centre and is the area where cyanide poisoning of elephants was rife.

The government's decision to order Tsholotsho villagers to surrender cyanide used to kill elephants in Hwange to Chief Siphoso has raised eyebrows following sensational revelations that the traditional leader is a convicted poacher.

A ministerial taskforce comprising Environment, Water and Climate minister Saviour Kasukuwere and also included Sydney Sekeramayi (Defence), Kembo Mohadi (Home Affairs), Ignatius Chombo (Local Government), Jonathan Moyo (Information) and Walter Mzembi (Tourism and Hospitality) last week gave an ultimatum to Tsholotsho villagers to hand over the cyanide to the chief by month-end [October 2013] or face arrest. This followed an admission that almost all households in villages bordering the Hwange National Park had stocks of cyanide they used to kill problem animals with.

The cabinet taskforce was set up after at least 100 elephants were killed at the game sanctuary, and several people from around Tsholotsho were arrested for being behind the scandal. The command to surrender the cyanide to Chief Siphoso was communicated by Kasukuwere during a meeting with villagers at the beginning of this month [October 2013]. "[To] those with cyanide, the police are saying surrender it to the chief within this month," the minister said. "The committee led by Chief Siphoso should make efforts to inform the community of this so they surrender the poison. If you are found after the end of the month in possession of the poison, then the police will deal with you."

But according to court records, the chief was tried and convicted of contravening Section 82 (1) of the Parks and Wildlife Management Act Chapter 20:14 and fined USD 200 or 2 months in prison for illegally dealing in ivory in 2009. Chief Siphoso, who was born Alphius Msindazi, gave his address as 7141/5 Pumula North, Bulawayo, and pleaded guilty to the charge.

He was nabbed by the police after being on the run for months when 3 other men arrested for possession of ivory implicated the chief in the scandal. The ivory was forfeited to the state.

In sentencing Chief Siphoso, Bulawayo provincial magistrate Phathekile Msipa said what aggravated the chief's case was that he is a traditional leader who should lead by example. "What you did is against the dictates of your role as a chief, as your actions bring into disrepute the name of chiefs throughout the country. You gave a bad example to the people you lead given the fact that you are expected to preside over cases that are brought before you," Msipa said in the ruling.

Ten poachers were arrested in September 2013 in what anti-poaching advocates said was the largest single killing of elephants in Zimbabwe's history. Three of the poachers have already been convicted and given jail terms of 15 and 16 years as well as mega fines. Efforts to get a comment from Kasukuwere yesterday [11 Oct 2013] were fruitless.

Meanwhile, a police boss and 3 of his subordinates who allegedly received a USD 10 000 bribe from poachers suspected to have poisoned elephants at the Hwange National Park will continue languishing in prison after they were denied bail yesterday [11 Oct 2013]. The bribe money was for the release of a Toyota Hilux, which police had intercepted in Harare carrying a consignment of ivory.

Bulawayo magistrate Gladmore Mushove yesterday [11 Oct 2013] denied the 4 -- detective assistant inspector Alois Gakata, detective sergeant Wellington Jena, detective constables Shadreck Rore and Ronald Dube -- bail, arguing that they were a flight risk considering the magnitude of the case. They were all remanded in custody to 14 Oct 2013.

The detectives were implicated by Clever Khumalo (44) and Sipho Mafu (54) who are being charged with delivering, or offering toxic substances and also illegally possessing ivory in contravention of the Parks and Wildlife Act and the Environmental Management Act. Khumalo and Mafu are jointly charged with Sanelisiwe Dube of 15099 Nkulumane 12, still at large. They were allegedly selling the ivory in Harare and South Africa.

[Sadly, these poachers have been very shrewd observers of animal behavior. Elephants need a relatively large amount of sodium in their diet. The Journal of Mammalogy indicates that they tend to be somewhat deficient in sodium. As a consequence, they tend to seek out the salty soil and consume it.

Many elephant and mammal salt licks are areas within the ground that are high in sodium. An early salt lick may be seen at: http://www.lastrefuge.co.uk/php/show-images-all-big.php?id=AW03538. However, these salt licks do not remain flat. After a time, they resemble a hole which can hold water, as seen at: http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0169555X1100314X-gr2.jpg.

According to the Journal of Mammalogy, Holdo, Dudley and McDowell 83(3):652-664, 2002:

"We studied the use of mineral licks by African elephants (_Loxodonta africana_) during the dry season in a Kalahari-sand habitat in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, to investigate the role of geophagy as a mechanism for supplementing low Na+ levels in browse and natural water supplies. Plant, water, and soil macrominerals were measured to evaluate mineral availability for elephants during the dry season. Elephant behavior was monitored at licks to investigate the intensity of geophagy (measured by number of mouthfuls of soil consumed) in relation to fecal-Na+ loss. Female elephants, which probably had greater requirements than did males because of pregnancy and lactation, consumed more mouthfuls of soil and spent a greater part of their activity budget feeding on soil than did males, suggesting that geophagy may be driven by a nutritional requirement. We found the following consistent with the Na+-supplementation hypothesis: 1) unlike other minerals, Na+ in woody plants and natural water supplies may be inadequate to meet the minimum requirements of elephants during the dry season; 2) soils consumed by elephants differed from other soils primarily in their high Na+ content; 3) intensity of geophagy was negatively correlated with fecal Na+; and 4) elephants in non-Kalahari-sand habitats do not appear to create or use licks, probably because they are able to meet their Na+ requirements from ubiquitous Na+-rich water supplies, which do not occur naturally in Kalahari-sand habitats."

But according to page 109 of: http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/HazardousWaste/Cyanide/upload/CN_remediation_young.pdf: "Soils, wastes and ores containing minerals such as ilmenite (FeTiO 3 ), hematite(Fe2 O3), bauxite [AlO.OH/Al(OH)3] and pyrite (FeS2), as well as mineral-groups such as feldspars, zeolites and clays have been shown to effectively adsorb free and metal-complexed cyanides [62-66]. Depending on the mineral, cyanide adsorption is usually a combination of 2 mechanisms: ion exchange, precipitation or coulombic interaction. Cyanide attenuation by such mineral commodities purifies ground and surface waters but increases cyanide consumption in leaching operations."

With bowl-like areas holding water, a number of things may be in play to neutralize the stable sodium cyanide or even potassium cyanide. It is possible that the cyanide salt may be bound or neutralized by the calcrete clays that are the dominant constituent of the soil matrix around these natural salt licks in Hwange's Kalahari Sands habitats. However, if that were the case, we should be seeing fewer deaths than have occurred. The rainy season should be upon these areas soon and may help dilute the water holes where these very stable cyanide salts are.

While some substances may bind the cyanide salts, they could be detoxified by acidifying the soil or the water. However, this is a very dangerous situation, as when the acid is applied to the cyanide salts, they release the cyanide as gas, and such gas escaping in a cloud from one of these salt holes or licks may be enough to kill the person unless they have protective gear such as respirators and suits. This would also be a labor intensive and expensive method, but it could be done.

What doesn't make sense is that vultures are dying. Vultures are scavenger animals. Cyanide from a dead animal will not cause a secondary poisoning in the animal consuming the carcass. Cyanide will cause primary poisoning in vultures, especially if they are drinking from cyanide treated watering holes.

If it is secondary poisoning only, then I would put aldicarb on my differential list. Aldicarb is a very potent carbamate, causing rapid death. A rapid death, especially of secondary predators such as vultures, sounds more likely to be aldicarb than cyanide. It seems like some samples need to be sent to a laboratory capable of testing for aldicarb.

For more information, see page 109 in this document:
http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/HazardousWaste/Cyanide/upload/CN_remediation_young.pdf.

Perhaps if lucky, at least some of the cyanide in the salt licks will be bound and neutralized by the calcrete clays which are the dominant constituent of the soil matrix of the natural salt licks in Hwange's Kalahari Sands habitats.

However, it seems a new scandal has implicated a number of people, and the source of the animal poisonings is indeed cyanide. So it must have been a primary poisoning of cyanide affecting the vultures.

While villagers may have given up their cyanide, they may still have aldicarb or other lethal toxins. This investigation may not be over. - Mod.TG
