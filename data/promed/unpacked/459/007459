[Re: ProMED-mail Human enterovirus 68 - novel pathogen, worldwide 20110929.2945]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Enterovirus 68 (EV68) can be detected by any good HRV [human
rhinovirus] real-time PCR (we use the Lu et al. HRV assay with
modifications). As was noted in the post, this virus has been known
for some time. Genotyping positives identified with a good screening
assay will yield some EV68s among kids with ARIs [acute respiratory
infections] in any given year (we have been looking from 2001
onwards). With that in mind, I'm not sure "novel pathogen" as part of
the title of the ProMED post sends the best message about this little
guy.

[ProMED-mail apologizes for an inadvertent delay in posting this
comment. The information provided by Dr Mackay indicates that it was
misleading to have designated this virus as a novel pathogen. -
