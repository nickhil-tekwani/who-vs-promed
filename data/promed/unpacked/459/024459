Ohio health officials are investigating whether 9 people who reported
suffering from stomachaches, rashes, and numbness were sickened by
toxic water from the state's largest inland lake.

One man, whose dog died after a swim in the lake, was hospitalized
last week [week of 19 Jul 2010] after he gave the dog a bath. Within
days, the 43-year-old man began having trouble walking and lost
feeling in his arms and feet.

"We weren't swimming in the lake because it's disgusting," said the
victim's wife, whose husband, is still having trouble with memory
loss and fatigue. "Our dog was just covered in that sludge, and my
husband washed him."

Thick patches of green and turquoise slime with toxins that health
officials say can cause rashes, vomiting, or even liver and nerve
damage have been floating on Grand Lake St. Marys in western Ohio
since the beginning of summer [2010].

The state says the recreational lake is no longer safe for swimmers
or boaters or for fishing. Residents say they've seen hundreds of
dead fish washed up on the shores. The city of Celina, with about 10
000 residents, gets its drinking from the lake, but the state says
the water is treated to remove the toxins and is monitored regularly.

Friday [30 Jul 2010], Gov. Ted Strickland announced a series of steps
to combat the algae outbreak, starting with a test project in
September [2010] to see if a chemical can slow the algae's growth.

The state also wants farmers to reduce the amount of manure that
makes its way into the water and feeds the algae. Proposals include
preventing farmers from putting manure on fields during the winter
and requiring large farms to have plans for getting rid of their manure.

The lake, midway between Toledo and Dayton, is one of the state's
most polluted waters because of fertilizer and manure that runs off
from the nearby farms and flows into creeks and streams that empty
into the lake.

"This crisis has been generations in the making, and it will take all
of us working together to try to restore this lake to health and
prosperity," Strickland said.

This year [2010], state environmental regulators have found a
different species of algae that can produce up to 7 different toxins.
Water tests have shown low levels of 2 toxins -- cylindrospermopsin
and saxitoxin -- that can affect the liver and nervous systems.

While this type of blue-green algae called cyanobacteria has been
found elsewhere in lakes and rivers, less is known about the toxins
they produce.

There are no federal guidelines on how much exposure is dangerous and
no tests can determine whether people are sickened by it. Instead,
doctors are forced to rule out other causes before they can blame the
algae, said Jen House, spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Health.
Many symptoms such as nausea and diarrhea are common to other
diseases, she said.

Nine people have come forward since early July [2010] to say they
might have been sickened by the water, House said. State and local
health workers have been interviewing those who reported illnesses,
asking them about how much contact they've had with the water and
meeting with their doctors, she said.

The victim, who lives about a block from the lake in Celina, said his
problems started after his black Labrador jumped in the water about 2
weeks ago. After pulling the slime off the dog, the victim had
trouble walking and with his vision. He even started swerving while
driving, his wife said.

The victim spent 4 days in a hospital where doctors first thought he
had a stroke. They ruled that out along with other diseases.

Dr. Wilfred Ellis, an infectious disease specialist, said he's pretty
certain the toxins are to blame for the victim's illness. He also
said the neurological problems could be permanent.

"This is why they put the warnings up at the lake," he said.

The victim's dog died Sunday [25 Jul 2010]. Veterinarian Craig Miesse
said at least 3 dogs may have died from either swimming or drinking
the lake water. One was found floating in the lake after it had been
spotted drinking from it.

The water warnings also have wiped out the area's tourism business,
which brings in over USD 100 million to marinas, campgrounds, and
restaurants each year. Organizers of a boat race that draws about 30
000 people each year said Friday [31 Jul 2010] they will cancel the
event scheduled for late August.

[This article says: "The state says the recreational lake is no
longer safe for swimmers or boaters or for fishing. Residents say
they've seen hundreds of dead fish washed up on the shores. The city
of Celina, with about 10 000 residents, gets its drinking from the
lake, but the state says the water is treated to remove the toxins
and is monitored regularly."

But the article does not indicate if the lake was designated unsafe
for swimmers and boaters before or after the incident reported here.
Furthermore, if it was before the incident, why were there no warning
signs posted? Had there been announcements on the local news? In the
local newspaper? One wonders if this situation could have been
prevented. The physician treating the victim implies that the
warnings were put up after this particular victim was identified as
suffering from toxins from the water.

Saxitoxin is a naturally occurring poison and is reportedly one of
the most toxic, non-protein substances known. It is known that the
LD50 (median lethal dose) in mice is 8 micrograms/kilogram. Based on
a human weighing approx. 70 kg (154 lb), a lethal dose would be a
single dose of 0.2 mg.

Saxitoxin is readily soluble in water and can be dispersed in
aerosols. Saxitoxin is a sodium ion channel blocker.

The toxin can be produced by several algal species or
dinoflagellates. Those species include _Pyrodinium bahamense_,
_Alexandrium tamarense_, and _Gymnodinium catenatum_. As such it is
more often known as paralytic shellfish poisoning. When consumed in
puffer fish incorrectly prepared it is known as fugu poisoning.

If mollusks consume these toxic algae, they are capable of
concentrating them. Therefore human ingestion of the mollusks could
certainly prove fatal.

However, other toxins produced by dinoflagellates have proven to
cause illness and irritation from water spray in the eyes and
inhalation of the toxin from the water spray. Given that, it is
likely the contact with the toxin, as well as inhalation of the toxin
during the washing of the dog may have caused the problems in this individual.

Cylindrospermopsin is a tricyclic alkaloid. This particular alkaloid
has resulted in severe, acute hepatotoxicity at low doses in both
humans and animals. It is a naturally produced toxin of certain
cyanobacterial strains. The production of cylindrospermopsin is
strain specific and not species specific. Treating lakes with
algaecides may kill the cyanobacteria, but it also will result in an
increased concentration of cylindrospermopsin in the water due to cell lysis.

This toxin has been found in drinking water, notably in Australia and
the US, and has been a concern of the World Health Organization in
other countries.

So if this municipal region is processing drinking water from this
lake, and knowing there have been outbreaks in the US and Australia,
in drinking water, then what test is this city using to ensure that
all of cylindrospermopsin is being removed from the drinking water?
Or any hepatic problems diagnosed in the town have not been connected
to the drinking water? - Mod.TG]
