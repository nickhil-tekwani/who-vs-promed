LASSA FEVER IN SIERRA LEONE - UPDATE:
In collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Sanitation and the Lassa
Fever Research project, the WHO support team with a specialist from CDC has
assessed the extent and severity of the outbreak after making field trips
to Kailahun and Kenema Districts during 26 and 27 May.
WHO has provided drugs and supplies for hospitalized patients through the
District Medical Officer in Kenema and specialized nursing support from
CDC, Atlanta has been given.
Over 40 health personnel from the two districts affected attended a
workshop organized by the team which reviewed:- basic epidemiological
concepts, the need for surveillance and the epidemiology and control of
Lassa Fever. A demonstration of barrier nursing techniques
was also given.
The conclusion of the WHO support mission is that a major epidemic of Lassa
Fever has occurred in Kailahun and Kenema Districts and is continuing as
unusually large numbers of severely ill patients are still being admitted
to hospital, with a large number of deaths still occurring.
A total of 167 cases and 60 deaths have been recorded during the period
January to 28 May 1996.
