The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) saw another 1000 total monkeypox cases in the past month, rising from 2591 cases on 5 Jul to 3567 on 9 Aug [2020], according to the World Health Organization. The monkeypox death toll in DRC has also risen to 132 through 9 Aug [2020].

WHO notes that one major challenge in the DRC to the current emergency includes acquiring the required funding to respond to all the multiple ongoing outbreaks in the country, which include Ebola, COVID-19, cholera, and others.

Monkeypox is a rare disease that occurs throughout remote parts of Central and West Africa, often near tropical rainforests. It is spread through contact with the monkeypox virus from an animal or human (alive or dead) or with materials contaminated with the virus.

Symptoms begin with fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, and exhaustion and is followed by a rash. Patients are usually ill for 2-4 weeks. Monkeypox is fatal in as many as 10% of people who get it.

[As noted previously, monkeypox [MPX] virus is endemic in the DRC, and the above report indicates that there are an increasing number of cases occurring again this year [2020]. Neither this report nor previous ones indicate how many of the reported cases have been laboratory confirmed. Without confirmation, some of these cases may be chickenpox, caused by varicella-zoster virus. There is no additional information about the circumstances under which these cases acquired their infection.

Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Studies of the prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp., an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected. MPX virus can be transmitted between people but not readily. - Mod.TY
