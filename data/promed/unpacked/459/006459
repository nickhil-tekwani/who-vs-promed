Asian soybean rust (ASR) is a very important disease caused by
_Phakopsora pachyrhizi_. The disease has emerged as a major threat to
soybean production in South America since 2001. During the 2003-2004
growing season, _P. pachyrhizi_ spread rapidly throughout most
soybean-growing areas of northwestern and northeastern Argentina (1).
One widespread naturalized host in the northeastern part of the
country is kudzu (_Pueraria lobata_). Plants of severely infected
kudzu were sampled during January 2005 in Cerro Azul (29o 29' S
Misiones Province) to quantify _P. pachyrhizi_ infection and
morphologically characterize the fungus in leaves. The number of
lesions, uredinia per square cm, and uredinia per lesion were
recorded from the undersides of 50 leaflets that were visually
showing rust symptoms.
The average number of lesions and uredinia per square cm was 14 (4 to
22), and 24 (5 to 78), respectively. The number of uredinia per
lesion was 3 (one to 10). 20 leaflets from the lower canopy averaged
55 (42 to 78) uredinia per square cm. The average size of
urediniospores was 18.4 micrometers wide (12.5 to 22.5) and 22.7
micrometers long (17.5 to 26.3). Although important epidemics of ASR
have not been registered on soybean crops in January (2) because of
adverse conditions, the fungus was observed on kudzu plants.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of morphologic and
pathometric characterization of _P. pachyrhizi_ on kudzu in Argentina.

[This information on the morphologic and pathometric characteristics
of ASR will be useful in determining the significance of lesion
numbers and densities of ASR spores on kudzu under various climatic
conditions. For a comprehensive review of kudzu and its management, see the
