CRYPTOSPORIDIOSIS - IRELAND (GALWAY)

Galway's water supply has been hit by an outbreak of the parasite
cryptosporidium, with up to 170 people now confirmed to have been hit
by a serious stomach bug as a result. The outbreak has severely
affected homes and businesses in Ireland's 3rd-biggest city, and
residents have been warned that the crisis could last for months.
Doctors have warned that the parasite could be life threatening,
especially to young children, the elderly and people with low immune systems.
Tests found that the city's water supply contained nearly 60 times
the safe limit of cryptosporidium pollution.
Residents have already been unable to drink or use water for food
preparation for weeks and have complained that no free clean water
has been made available by the authorities.
Parents with young families have also expressed real concerns and
demanded action. "It's not right, we shouldn't have to pay for our
water when the local supply is polluted," said Galway resident Sarah Doran.
Galway City Council has told the BBC News website that they have been
advised by the health authorities that tankers of free water could
create further health problems, by increasing the risk of spreading
bacteria. The mayor of Galway, Niall O Brolchain, has called on the
Irish government to provide more funding to upgrade water treatment
services. However, Irish Environment Minister Dick Roche said that
the government had already made 21 million euros [over USD 28
million] available for such projects in Galway, but the local council
had failed to make use of the money.
Business leaders have also expressed worries over the impact the
crisis will have on what is traditionally the beginning of the
tourist season in the west of Ireland. One hotelier said it was
costing him up to 2000 euros [USD 2700] a week to provide bottled
water for his guests, and he was now being forced to install his own
filtration system. However, Galway GP Martin Daly warned that
filtration was not the answer. "The newest water treatment plant we
have is 40 years old," he said. "People have been warning for years
about this. Filtration is not the answer. We need to go to the source
of the contamination to solve it."

[_Cryptosporidia_ spp. are common organisms in drinking water drawn
from lakes and streams, but the water supply could also be
contaminated by sewage. _Cryptosporidia_ are resistant to
chlorination, which makes treatment of surface water difficult.
ProMED would be interested in posting more about the outbreak. - Mod.EP]
