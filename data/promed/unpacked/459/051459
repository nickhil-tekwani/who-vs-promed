An attending veterinarian has confirmed 2 equids at a boarding facility in Strathcona County, Alberta, Canada with equine influenza. Twelve additional horses at the facility were exposed.

The affected equids include a 4 year old Welsh-cross mare and a 5 year old Welsh-cross gelding. The gelding began coughing on 12 Dec 2020, and the mare showed signs of nasal discharge the next day. Both horses were confirmed positive on 16 Dec 2020. Neither horse was vaccinated. A voluntary quarantine was enacted for equids at the facility.

Equine influenza is a highly contagious respiratory disease infecting horses, ponies, and other equids, such as donkeys, mules, and zebras. The virus causing it is spreads via saliva and respiratory secretions from infected horses. Horses are commonly exposed via horse-to-horse contact; aerosol transmission from coughing and sneezing; and contact with humans' contaminated hands, shoes, or clothes or contaminated tack, buckets, or other equipment.

Clinical signs of equine influenza infection can include a high fever (up to 106 F [41 C]); a dry, hacking cough; depression; weakness; anorexia; serous (watery) nasal discharge; and slightly enlarged lymph nodes. Consider monitoring your horse's health at shows by taking temperature daily, which can help you pick up on signs of infection early and take appropriate measures to reduce disease spread [Many veterinarians recommend monitoring the horse's temperature as often as twice daily. - Mod.TG].

Vaccination is an important and inexpensive way to protect your horse. US Equestrian requires proof of horses having had an equine influenza vaccination within the 6 months prior to attending organization-sanctioned competitions or events. Your veterinarian can help you determine what other vaccines your horse might benefit from.

In addition to vaccinating, following strict biosecurity protocols can help reduce your horse's chance of infection and disease. Such measures include quarantining new equine arrivals at barns, disinfecting buckets and equipment, and preventing nose-to-nose contact between horses.

[Caution should be exercised around equine influenza, which is caused by 2 subtypes of influenza A viruses. We do not want to be the reason it transfers to other horses via indirect transmission. This is a serious disease, after which a horse can take a long time to recover to its pre-disease state. Be patient with your animal, and support the healing process.
