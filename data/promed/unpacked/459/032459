OJD found on 9 WA farms
-----------------------
Western Australia's sheep industry has abandoned hopes of eradicating the
animal wasting ovine Johne's disease (OJD) after it was found at 9
properties in the state. OJD Advisory Committee chairman Chris Richardson
said eradication of the disease from WA with current technology was not
feasible. "The Department of Agriculture is finalizing a proposed
management program for OJD in Western Australia and will provide costing
and recommendations to the OJD committee for consideration," Mr Richardson
said.
OJD is a serious wasting disease that affects sheep, cattle, goats, deer,
alpaca and llama. It causes a thickening of the intestinal wall which
blocks the normal absorption of food, meaning the animal eats but cannot
absorb nutrients, resulting in wasting and eventually death.
Mr Richardson said OJD could be managed economically using vaccination and
other flock management tools, and said a plan was being developed to help
producers understand the disease. WA is the only state in the country
deemed free of the disease after meeting national criteria when an
agreement was drawn up in October 1999. WA's Department of Agriculture said
OJD Free Zone status was assigned by the commonwealth's Primary Industries
Standing Committee on the recommendation of the federal Animal Health
Committee, and any review of that status would involve an orderly transition.
