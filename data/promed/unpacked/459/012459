Correction: _Pasteurella_, gazelle - Mongolia (Sukhbaatar)
----------------------------------------------------------
We are writing to provide further information to ProMED-mail posting
Anthrax, gazelle - Mongolia: (Sukhbaatar) 20080819.2582, dated Mon 19 Aug 2008.

This report from China is presumably based on an article circulated
by the Mongolian news agency <http://www.dailynews.mn> on 15 Aug
2008. This report stated that approximately 150 Mongolian gazelles
(_Procapra gutturosa_) had been found dead close to the
Mongolia-China border in Erdenetsgaan sum (country) of Sukhbaatar
aimag (province) and that an additional 40 gazelles were also found
dead by border guards in the area. The report went on to say that
emergency measures had been implemented and included the destruction
of 40 dead gazelles and surveying nearby areas. Furthermore, samples
taken from 2 gazelles were submitted for diagnosis at the provincial
veterinary laboratory, and confirmed the presence of _Pasteurella_.
The [provincial] emergency committee then planned to survey 13
counties in Sukhbaatar and the neighboring [province] of Dornod for
more gazelle deaths.

On 20 Aug 2008 the [Daily News] updated that a total of 600 gazelles
had been found dead along the border in Sukhbaatar province and
assumed _Pasteurella_ involvement.

_Pasteurella_ outbreaks were reported in Mongolia in 1974 and killed
130 000 gazelles. Since then, further outbreaks were reported in 1980
and 1984. Acute infections of livestock with _Pasteurella_ are
associated with high fever and hemorrhage, while chronic infections
are associated with signs of pneumonia. _Pasteurella_ may suddenly
occur in livestock due to unpleasant weather conditions, and other
animal husbandry changes, such as change in feed, etc. Generally
livestock and animals with _Pasteurella_ die within couple of days of exposure.

Further clarification was provided by Dr Odser, head of the
Sukhbaatar Aimag Veterinary Laboratory on 20 Aug 2008. He said that a
total of 689 dead gazelles were found along the border area in
Sukhbaatar province. Samples obtained from 2 dead gazelles were
initially tested at Sukhbaatar Aimag Veterinary Laboratory
identifying the presence of _Pasteurella multocida_ and was confirmed
by the State Central Veterinary Laboratory (Ulaanbaatar) on 19 Aug
2008. They did not have any information whether further gazelle
mortality had occurred in bordering areas in China and whether
anthrax may be involved there. However, at least in Mongolia, there
had not been an indication of anthrax involvement and current
indications and test results suggested _Pasteurella multocida_.

[For reports we are largely dependent on journalists' stories --
their word, not mine -- and sometimes they are just that. We are most
grateful for the authoritative and rapid correction by Drs
Enkhtuvshin, Gilbert, and Sodnomdarjaa.

To quote Mod.TG "Pasteurellosis in sheep and goats is caused by
_Pasteurella_ spp. Most often those are _P. haemolytica_ and _P.
multocida_, as these organisms are often commensal with the tonsils
and nasopharynx of healthy sheep and goats. These are nonmotile,
non-spore-forming aerobic gram-negative coccobacilli. There are 16
serotypes of _P. haemolytica_, which are currently recognized.

Generally, it is a respiratory disease, but also manifests as
septicemia, arthritis, meningitis, and mastitis.

Pneumonic pasteurellosis is caused most often by _P. multocida_ in
sheep and goats and can lead to high mortality and great economic
loss. Transition from infection to disease appears to be facilitated
by various stressors including concurrent infections, changes in
climate, pasture, or feed, and other management factors."

I have appended the ProMED-mail reports of this disease in US bighorn
sheep to provide some background. It is a long-standing problem. - Mod.MHJ]
