Second mad cow case confirmed in Czech Republic
-----------------------------
PRAGUE -- The third round of tests on a Czech cow suspected of being
infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) has proven positive,
the Czech Veterinary Institute has announced.
The 6 year old cow, on a private farm in Svetnov village, about 120 km
south east of the capital Prague, was found to have developed mad cow
disease on Monday. It is not known yet how the cow was infected. A cow of
the same age and 3 calves of the infected animal on the farm will be
slaughtered as part of preventive measures. Their brain tissue will be
immediately tested for BSE, Czech veterinary officials said. If any tests
prove positive, all cattle over 12 months older or younger [? - Mod.SH on
the farm will be slaughtered and tested.
This is the second occurrence of BSE in the Czech Republic. After a cow on
a cooperative farm at Dusejov was diagnosed with BSE disease in June, 134
cows in the herd were slaughtered and all cattle older than 30 months in
the country began to undergo tests. The Czech Republic became the first
country in central and eastern Europe where BSE cases have been found.
