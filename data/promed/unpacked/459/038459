Avian influenza A(H5N1) in Egypt, 9 Apr 2015
--------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health and Population of Egypt has notified WHO of additional laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) during the last few weeks. With this additional number, the total number of cases reported during the month of March 2015 now stands at 30 cases, including 4 deaths. This increase in reported human cases has been observed since the beginning of November last year [2014].

Since its introduction in Egypt in 2006, avian influenza A(H5N1) virus has been circulating in domestic poultry in the country and has been the source of sporadic human infections. Almost all cases of H5N1 infection reported in humans in recent times have been associated with close contact with infected live or dead birds, or H5N1-contaminated environments. Though the number of cases reported is higher compared to last year, the increase in the number of cases does not change current risk status of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus that is currently circulating at the animal-human interface in the country.

Since it was 1st reported in March 2006, a total of 336 cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) infections in humans have been reported, including 114 related deaths (case-fatality rate = 34 per cent).

[2015 is striking in the sharp increase in human cases. The case-fatality rate (CFR) spans a broad range, from 10 per cent to 75 per cent, with an overall CFR of 33.9 per cent. The 75 per cent is derived from only 4 cases, so needs to be interpreted with caution. An infographic that is very informative is included in the WHO report, and can be viewed at the URL above. It includes highlights and figures of cases by location and year, week, gender and age group, outcome, and more.

Highlights are:

Since its emergence in March 2006, a total of 336 cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) infections in humans have been reported from Egypt, including 114 deaths (CFR = 33.8 per cent). Of these, a total of 159 cases including 47 deaths (CFR = 29 per cent) were reported since November 2014 when the country experienced a surge in human infections.

Cases were reported from 21 out of 29 governorates in the country during the recent surge. Amongst the cases reported since November 2014, the females comprised 60 per cent of all reported cases and had a higher death rate of 33 per cent, compared to 28 per cent reported amongst the males.

Since the upsurge in cases began in November 2014, the age group of 30-45 years has been found to be the most at risk of acquiring the infection (31 per cent), followed by children in the under 5 years age group (28 per cent), while the age group above 45 years had the highest CFR (47 per cent), and the children under 5 years of age group had the lowest CFR (7 per cent).

Despite the recent surge in human cases, the demographic and epidemiological characteristics of the reported cases do not show any significant change.
