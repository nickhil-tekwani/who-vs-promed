Headlines
- During the 4-day visit to polio endemic countries of Afghanistan and Pakistan, WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, reiterated WHO's commitment to help endemic, outbreak, and at-risk countries eradicate poliovirus.

- In Mozambique, a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreak is confirmed.

Summary of new viruses this week
- Afghanistan: 2 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1)-positive environmental samples
- Pakistan: 9 WPV1-positive environmental samples
- Mozambique: 1 new case of cVDPV2.

Afghanistan
- No WPV1 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 was 21.
- 2 WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported this week from Lashkargah district, Hilmand province. The samples were collected on [6 Dec 2018].
- Afghanistan recently concluded a targeted national campaign.

Pakistan
- No cases of WPV1 were reported this week. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 in the country was 8.
- 9 WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week: 2 from Lahore district and 2 from Rawalpindi district in Punjab province; 1 from Quetta district and 1 from Killa Abdullah district in Balochistan province; 1 from Orangi and 1 from Gadap in Karachi district, Sindh province; 1 from Peshawar district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Samples were collected from [11-15 Dec 2018].
- It is important to note that of the 5 districts reporting cases in 2018, 3 were from areas outside the core reservoirs.

Nigeria
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported this week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 was 33.
- No cases of WPV1 were reported. The most recently detected WPV1 case, from Borno state, had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016].
- The country continues to be affected by 2 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks: the 1st centered in Jigawa state with subsequent spread to other states as well as to neighbouring Republic of Niger, and the 2nd in Sokoto state.
- Recent confirmation of spread of one of the cVDPV2 outbreaks, both within Nigeria and internationally, underscores the urgent need to fill remaining vaccination gaps in the ongoing outbreak response and to optimize the geographic extent and operational quality of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) response.
- At the same time, outbreak response to WPV1 continues, including efforts to address surveillance and immunity gaps in parts of Borno state.

Lake Chad Basin
- No case of cVDPV2 has been reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported in Niger [in 2018] was 9, which are genetically linked to a cVDPV2 outbreak originating in Jigawa, Nigeria. The virus was isolated from children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) from Zinder region, located in the south of Niger and on the border with Nigeria, with dates of onset of paralysis ranging from [18 Jul 2018] through [7 Sep 2018].
- AFP surveillance and routine immunization across the country with focus on the infected provinces and the provinces at the international borders with Nigeria are being reinforced.
- Active case-finding for additional AFP cases is continuing, and additional surveillance measures such as increasing the frequency and extent of environmental surveillance and community sampling of healthy individuals is being expanded.

Central Africa
- No cases of cVDPV2 were reported this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported in 2018 was 20.
- DRC is affected by 4 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks in the provinces of Haut Katanga, Mongala, Maniema, and Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri.
- Following the Kinshasa Declaration for Polio Eradication in July 2016, the 2 large-scale vaccination rounds implemented during September and October 2018 demonstrated better vaccination quality. Planning is underway to maintain the gains made so far and maintain population immunity as well as sensitive surveillance across the country.
- The polio outbreak response is being conducted simultaneously to an ongoing Ebola outbreak affecting North Kivu province, in the east of the country (close to provinces affected by cVDPV2). As in the past, the polio teams are coordinating closely with the broader humanitarian emergency network to ensure both outbreaks are addressed in a coordinated manner (as was the case during the recent Ebola outbreak in Equateur province, which was successfully stopped).
- Partners of the GPEI will continue to support authorities across the country to ensure that this new level of commitment rapidly translates into operational improvements on the ground.

Horn of Africa
- No cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week.
- The Horn of Africa is currently affected by separate outbreaks of cVDPV2 and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3), reporting both cases and environmental positives.
- Somalia has reported a total of 12 cVDPV cases (5 type 2, 6 type 3, and 1, coinfection of both type 2 and type 3) in 2018.
- Circulating VDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in one environmental sample in Kenya.
- Outbreak response to both virus types is currently being implemented in line with internationally agreed guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle, and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia.
- Another vaccination round is planned during end-November [2018] as part of the ongoing outbreak response to further enhance the population immunity in the highest risk areas. [Presumably this was conducted - Mod.MPP] Special surveillance activities continue to be undertaken to determine the origin of the viral circulation.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Papua New Guinea
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 was 26.
- Emergency operation centres are established and operational at the national level and in all affected provinces; environmental surveillance is functional in 5 sites in 2 major cities.
- 3 SIAs of expanding scope have taken place since late July [2018], from 3 provinces to 9, to nationwide. The most recent was aimed at children under the age of 15 due to large numbers of poorly immunized older children.
- Planning is underway for the next steps of the outbreak response, focusing on both vaccination and surveillance for polioviruses.
- Detection and reporting of new viruses or cases at this point in the outbreak response is not unusual or unexpected, as surveillance is being strengthened, and most reported and confirmed cases had onset of paralysis prior to the start of comprehensive outbreak response.

Mozambique
- A new cVDPV2 outbreak has been confirmed in Mozambique.
- 2 genetically linked cVDPV2 isolates were detected from an AFP case (with onset of paralysis on [21 Oct 2018], in a 6-year-old girl with no history of vaccination, from Molumbo district, Zambezia province) and a community contact of the case.
- The GPEI and partners are working with country counterparts to support the local public health authorities in conducting a field investigation (clinical, epidemiological, and immunological) and thorough risk assessment to discuss planning and implementation of immunization and outbreak response.
- In January 2017, a single VDPV2 virus had been isolated from a 5-year-old boy with AFP, also from Zambezia province (Mopeia district). Outbreak response was conducted in the 1st half of 2017 with mOPV2).

[Given the time lag between dates of onset of paralysis and final laboratory testing of virus isolates, cases with dates of onset in 2018 are still being confirmed. That being said, 2018 continues to have cases confirmed -- both cVDPV and WPV -- bringing the annual totals of confirmed cases above that seen in 2017.

While there were no official reports of WPV1-associated disease in this week's update, the media report below mentions the confirmation of a polio-associated AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) case in Lakki Marwat district, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Presumably this case will be officially reported in the coming weeks. But there have been positive WPV1 isolates from environmental samples taken in December 2018 in both Afghanistan and Pakistan, confirming that the virus is still circulating in both countries.

The disturbing piece of news is the confirmation of a cVDPV2-associated polio case in Mozambique. Unfortunately, reading between the lines, it is possible that the mOPV2 (monovalent oral poliovaccine type 2) campaign held in Mozambique in 2017 is related to the cVDPV2 identified last year [2018]. If so, this may be the 2nd incident of cVDPV2-associated polio following mOPV2 campaigns (see Poliomyelitis update (02): DR Congo, cVDPV, WHO, China, vaccine challenges 20190109.6250155 for details on the 1st case in DR Congo). Concerns regarding a vicious circle of cVDPV-associated polio cases, immunization campaigns with mOPV2, followed by 1-2 years with additional cVDPV2 cases . . . a very difficult conundrum. Is the time approaching to leave OPV? We now have 29 cases of WPV-associated disease (the wild poliovirus) and 101 cases of cVDPV-associated disease in 2018.

A polio case has been reported in Lakki Marwat district of Khyber Pakhtunhwa [province], an official Twitter handle reported.

"Polio case has been reported from Lakki Marwat, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Total number of polio cases in Pakistan in 2018 is at 9. Vaccinating all children in every campaign is critical to attain full immunity against the virus and to #endpolio in #Pakistan," End Polio tweeted.

Babar Atta, focal person to Prime Minister Imran Khan, confirmed that another polio case was reported from district Lakki Marwat in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

He said that samples of the child were collected during December 2018; therefore, the case belongs to 2018 polio case tally.

[As this case is listed in the End Polio Pakistan tally of confirmed cases, we should expect to see this case reported in the weekly WHO/GPEI weekly updates in the coming weeks. This will raise the total number of polio cases reported by Pakistan in 2018 to 9 (see http://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-in-provinces), and the global total for 2018 will increase to 30.

Additional information from a Dawn article (that was published while I was writing this moderator comment!) mentions the case is a 16-month-old girl from the Marmundu Azam area of district Lakki Marwat, and that the girl had onset of paralysis on 10 Dec 2018. The Pakistani National Institute of Health confirmed the case today [Thu 10 Jan 2019] (https://www.dawn.com/news/1456707/polio-case-surfaces-in-khyber-pakhtunkhwas-lakki-marwat-district).

Checking prior reports, the most recent positive environmental sample from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was from Bannu district and was reported in Poliomyelitis update (61): global (Nigeria), comment on social media 20181221.6217827. (Other reports of positive environmental samples from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province do not mention the district where the sample was taken). The most recent confirmed case in Pakistan in Lakki Marwat district, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, had a date of onset of paralysis on 21 Aug 2017.

A map of Khyber Pukhtunkhwa province showing districts can be found at http://pamirtours.pk/maps/PD%20Maps/KPK_districts_map_2.jpg. Lakki Marwat is located in the southern portion of the province, bordering with both North and South Waziristan districts, which are in the known endemic regions of the country. - Mod.MPP]
