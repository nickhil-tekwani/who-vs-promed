On [4 Dec 2018], the global field epidemiology community lost a visionary leader, nurturing mentor, fierce champion and generous friend. It is with unspeakable sadness that the TEPHINET Secretariat announces the passing of our director, Dr. Dionisio Jose Herrera Guibert.

Always with a ready smile, and always willing to listen and help, Dr. Herrera -- or "Dio," as he was affectionately known -- was, to most of his colleagues, a friend first and a coworker second. His genuine interest in people gave him an almost magical ability to build connections and create opportunities with colleagues in more than a hundred countries regardless of culture or geographic distance. As we in the global health arena know, overcoming precisely these obstacles is one of the biggest challenges to achieving results in our field. The global enterprise of field epidemiology training programs benefited from having a leader in TEPHINET who was able to do this with relative ease. Dr. Herrera helped TEPHINET grow, but he also helped develop and/or expand regional FETP networks in Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and the Eastern Mediterranean. Public health systems around the world are stronger because of his tireless efforts.

When Dr. Herrera took the helm of TEPHINET in March of 2009, our network consisted of 30 field epidemiology training programs working in the same number of countries. Today, our network comprises 71 programs serving more than 100 countries. Upon Dr. Herrera's arrival, the TEPHINET Secretariat operated with four staff members; today, we have a team of 20. Overseeing all of this growth was a leader unmatched in his patience and compassion for others.

On [30 Oct 2018], The Task Force for Global Health honored Dr. Herrera with its inaugural Consequential Compassion Award for Extraordinary Achievement in Global Health in a ceremony held at its headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. In attendance were members of his family, including his wife, children, and parents. Dr. Herrera often remarked that his family motivated his work. It is no wonder, then, that under his leadership, TEPHINET became more than a professional network; it became a family that worked together, and together we will continue his legacy.

Additional information on Dionisio's illustrious background prior to coming to work with TEPHINET includes working as the academic director of the Spain Field Epidemiology Training Program and as a member of the Alert Unit for Rapid Response at the Institute of Health Carlos III Ministry of Health and Consume in Madrid Spain. He also served as field epidemiology senior at the Institute of Public Health of Autonomous Community of Madrid, where he was a consultant to the field epidemiology training program. Other positions held by Dionisio include consultant to the Minister of Health and assistant doctor of family medicine at the Ministry of Public Health, Havana, Cuba, and as a medical doctor, head of residents, and specialist of community and family medicine at the National Reference Center for Primary Attention in Cuba. He also served as a member of the TEPHINET Board in 2007, and was an associate professor at the Complutense University of Madrid. He spent several years as a medical practitioner in Zambia and Guinea-Bissau as well. [This information is from the Task Force Information Page on Dionisio as Director of TEPHINET https://www.taskforce.org/team/dionisio-herrera-guibert-md].

If one reads the testimonies to Dionisio on Facebook and on Twitter, one can see the worldwide outpouring of respect, how many lives he touched, and how many public health careers and programs he helped launch through the years. And one will see the sorrow felt by many around the world for the too early loss of such a wonderful person.

On a personal and professional note, I had the good fortune to have known and collaborated with Dionisio and TEPHINET during the past 9 years. A very notable collaboration was in the development of EpiCore, a collaborative partnership between TEPHINET, ProMED-mail, HealthMap and the Skoll Global Threats Fund. But equally important to me was the friendship with Dionisio and his family that formed during this period. A friendship that will always be treasured in my memory, and continued with his family. Memories include many shared meals, many shared experiences in Atlanta and in many countries around the world. It is very hard for me to accept that he is really gone, albeit his memory will endure. We have all lost a very special person who touched so many lives.

[I want to add my own feelings of sadness and loss at Dionisio's untimely passing. He was a warm, caring man and a creative and generous collaborator, colleague and friend. He exuded kindness, caring and energy and was loved, admired and respected by those who knew him. We at ProMED are lucky to have known and worked with him and to have benefited from his wisdom and his dedication to global health. - Mod.LM]
