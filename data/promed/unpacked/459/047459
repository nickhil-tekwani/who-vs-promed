First Report of West Nile Virus-positive Birds in Illinois
----------------------------------------------------------
On Wed 5 Sep 2001, the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) was
notified that 2 dead crows submitted as part of the IDPH's arbovirus
surveillance program had tested positive for West Nile virus (WNV).
Although no human cases have yet been confirmed in Illinois, these results,
and positive test results from birds in several neighboring states
including Kentucky, Indiana, and Wisconsin, warrant increased awareness of
the possibility of human infection with WNV and other endemic arboviral
diseases such as St. Louis Encephalitis (SLE) and La Crosse Encephalitis (LAC).
Human infection with WNV has been reported in New York only as recently as
1999 but has been reported from many East Coast U.S. states including
Florida [in 2001. Wild birds are the primary reservoir hosts and _Culex_
spp. mosquitoes are a major vector. Humans are incidental hosts.
Person-to-person transmission is not known to occur. The incubation period
is usually 6 days (range 3 to 15 days). Most persons are asymptomatic.
Fewer than 1 in 100 persons will develop symptoms. Mild illness may include
fever, headache, myalgias, arthralgias, lymphadenopathy, and a
maculopapular or roseolar rash affecting the trunk and extremities.
Pancreatitis, hepatitis, and myocarditis have occasionally been reported.
Central nervous system involvement is rare and predominantly affects older
persons. There is no antiviral therapy or vaccine. Supportive care is
recommended for more severe cases.
During the 1999 New York outbreak, severe, diffuse muscle weakness was a
prominent finding. Heightened suspicion of this illness and other arboviral
illnesses is important given the recent test results from Illinois birds.
Testing of etiologic agents that cause aseptic meningitis or encephalitis
is encouraged. Such testing might include enteroviruses, herpes simplex
virus, varicella-zoster virus, and arboviruses including WNV, SLEV, and
LACV. Testing for enteroviruses and arboviruses including WNV can be
performed or facilitated through the Illinois Department of Public Health,
2121 W. Taylor Avenue, Chicago, IL 60612. Suspected or confirmed cases of
aseptic meningitis and encephalitis should be reported to your local health
department as soon as possible (within 7 days).
