Nearly 360 000 young hatchery salmon have died of a disease caught from
naturally spawning fish, state Department of Fish and Wildlife officials said.
The disease is caused by a parasite that infests the skin and gills of
fish, said Bob Rogers, a Fish and Wildlife fish health specialist.
Few of the parasites, _Ichthyophthirius multifilis_, were found in the
4-inch-long juvenile summer chinook salmon when they were moved from a
hatchery near Rocky Reach Dam to the Similkameen River rearing pond outside
of Oroville during the week of 4 Oct 2002, Rogers said. A week later, the
fish began to die. Rogers anticipates 5000 to 10 000 of the fish will survive.
High water temperatures caused by extremely low flow in the Similkameen
gave the parasite perfect conditions for reproducing, he said. Temperatures
reached 59 degrees; the usual range is 47 to 54 degrees.

[This species of parasitic ciliate is commonly referred to as "ick," or
"ich", a disease infecting and damaging the skin, gills, and/or eyes of
many species of fish. It often occurs in aquariums and wild fresh water
fish. The parasite's life cycle is direct and simple. The trophozoites are
found in pustules on the fish and escape when the pustules rupture. The
trophozoites settle to the substrate, form a "cyst," and then reproduce
asexually. The cyst, now containing hundreds of "swarmers" (or tomites),
breaks open, and the swarmers search for a new host. Upon contacting a new
host, the swarmer or tomite burrows into the host's tissue and grows into a
new pustule.
This parasite is found on many different species of fish under natural
conditions, but it is a particularly serious parasite under conditions of
confinement and high population density (i.e., aquaculture ponds, aquaria,
etc.).
Usually white spots and pustules are obvious by visual inspection
throughout the skin of a fish infected with ick. In addition, a gill biopsy
may be used to determine infection. These parasites are large (1 mm in
diameter).
There are a number of commercially available treatments for the parasite.
These parasites may be treated by adding diluted formaldehyde, malachite
green, or methylene blue to the water. There are also many commercial
treatments available that are effective. - Mod.TG]
