A press release from the Virginia Department of Health announced that 10 people are sick in Chesterfield, Virginia, in a legionnaires' disease outbreak. The 10 confirmed illnesses are more cases than the county sees during the summer, which is typically 3 cases. Due to this outbreak, a Chesterfield school was forced to close. The health department is working with the CDC to identify the outbreak source.

In a letter to the school's parents, Chesterfield's superintendent, Merv Daughtery, said that a water-cooling tower near the school is being disinfected. "The tower was tested for the presence of legionnaires'-causing bacteria, known as _Legionella_, and a preliminary result is expected in about a week," the letter said.

The director of the Chesterfield Department of Health, Dr. Alexander Samuel, said that the cooling towers are "more than likely" the cause, but he added that it's possible the health district might never determine a definitive source because the cases have been so spread out. The investigation is ongoing.

At this time, the health agency recommends that "out of an abundance of caution, the health district recommends that individuals who become ill with pneumonia-like or respiratory symptoms, such as fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, and headache, promptly seek medical care."

[Chesterfield County, with a population of 316 236 residents in 2010, is located just south of Richmond, the capital city of the Commonwealth of Virginia, USA, and is part of the Greater Richmond Region; its county seat is Chesterfield Court House (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesterfield_County,_Virginia). Chesterfield County can be found on a map at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Chesterfield+County,+VA.

The geographic distribution of cases within the county is not stated. However, the news report says that the Chesterfield school was "forced to close" because of the outbreak and that a water-cooling tower near the school is being disinfected, although tests of the tower for the presence of _Legionella_ are still pending.

Genotyping the clinical isolates from the 10 cases of legionnaires' disease will help confirm if this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping. - Mod.ML
