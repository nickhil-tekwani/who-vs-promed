The Center for Strategic Information on Surveillance of the Parana Secretariat of Health (SESA) reported from the beginning of July 2019 to date 66 notifications of epizootics signifying deaths of monkeys caused by diseases.

Surveillance monitors and investigates each of these deaths as a way of yellow fever [YF] prevention; like humans, monkeys are also infected by the yellow fever virus, and the deaths of these animals serves as an alert and indicator of the possible presence of the virus disease in the region.

Of the 66 registered monkey deaths, 34 remain under investigation to detect the virus, 11 were discarded, and the other 21 occurred for undetermined causes.

During this period, Parana did not confirm monkey deaths due to yellow fever. Even so, the SESA has redoubled its attention because these notifications reach 17 of the 22 Health Regions of the state.

"In addition, we are close to the new seasonal period of the disease, which takes place from December to May. The actions to combat and of prevention promoted by the State Department of Health are continuous, and the orientation that we consider fundamental is that the whole population receive the vaccine that protects against yellow fever," said Secretary Beto Preto.

The Strategic Information Center also received notifications related to cases of yellow fever in humans. Of the 22 reports registered from July 2019 so far, 15 have been discarded, and 7 are still under investigation. The cases that are still under analysis were detected in the municipalities of Paranagua, Curitiba, Balsa Nova, and Assis Chateaubriand.

From February to July this year [2019], SESA Environmental Surveillance technicians, with support from the Ministry of Health, Fiocruz, Sao Paulo Endemic Control Superintendence and Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul State Surveillance, conducted field research with the objective of tracing in advance the virus dispersion route for the next epidemiological period.

The identified routes show that in the next epidemiological period, the virus will cross practically all of Parana, reaching neighboring countries. After the Coast, Metropolitan Region and Campos Gerais, the areas hit hardest in the period 2018/2019, the North, Northwest, Center and South, should face progression of the disease in the new season.

"With this unprecedented work in the country, it was possible to organize a State Action Plan to Combat Yellow Fever. We are intensifying preventive measures, such as training professionals for clinical management and early diagnosis of the disease; surveillance of cases of epizootic diseases and intensification of the vaccination," said Maria Goretti David Lopes, Director of SESA's Health Care and Surveillance.

All professionals working in primary Care and epidemiological surveillance are involved in the Action Plan, which still provides for the active search for people who have not yet been vaccinated in the area of coverage of health facilities, and vaccination from house to house in hard to reach places, prioritizing rural residents, quilombola communities [Afro-descendants of self-liberated], indigenous people, and rural workers.

The vaccine that protects against yellow fever is available in health facilities throughout the state. A single dose protects for life. Those between 9 months to 59 years, 11 months and 29 days should receive the dose. For residents of municipalities that have confirmed cases of viral circulation of yellow fever, the Ministry of Health is also recommending immunization of people over 60 years.

Yellow fever is an infectious disease caused by a virus transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes. The initial symptoms are fever and chills, intense headache, back pain, muscle aches, vomiting and weakness.

SESA also states that monkeys do not transmit yellow fever. They occupy the role of sentinels in coping with yellow fever, indicating the path the virus is taking.

[Although the cause of the deaths of the monkeys has not been determined yet, the lengthy discussion of yellow fever (YF) and the steps being taken to increase surveillance and preparation for an anticipated outbreak suggest that YF is suspected. ProMED will be interested in any results that come from the cases under investigation.

Brazil has cases of YF during the seasons for sylvan (forest) transmission of the virus. Deaths of monkey are often indicators that the virus is circulating in a given area. There were major YF outbreaks in several states of Brazil during the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 seasons. A recent WHO report indicates that in the current 2018-2019 season (July 2018 to March 2019), a total of 75 confirmed human cases, including 17 deaths (case fatality rate = 23%), have been reported in Brazil in the states of Sao Paulo (62 cases), Parana (12), and Santa Catarina (1). That same report indicates that 33 confirmed epizootics (cases in non-human primates) were reported in 5 federal states: Sao Paulo (20), Rio de Janeiro (8), Minas Gerais (1), Mato Grosso (2), and Parana (2). In the 4 weeks preceding this report, epizootics have been confirmed in Sao Paulo and Parana states (see Yellow fever - Americas (07): Brazil, WHO 20190419.6432053). - Mod.TY
