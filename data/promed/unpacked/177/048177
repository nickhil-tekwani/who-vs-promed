Alaska officials say bags of chopped romaine lettuce are being
recalled over concerns of potential _Listeria_ contamination.
Meanwhile, a California farm said Thursday [29 Sep 2011] it was
voluntarily recalling bags of chopped romaine lettuce because of
possible contamination, though no illnesses have been reported.

The Alaska Department of Conservation has confirmed that the 2-pound
bags of chopped romaine lettuce from True Leaf Farms of Salinas,
California, which have a use-by date of 29 Sep 2011, were distributed
in Alaska by Church Brothers, LLC.

There have been no reported illnesses, but listeriosis can be fatal
and is particularly dangerous to people with weakened immune systems,
including infants, the elderly and people with HIV or those who are
undergoing chemotherapy.

_Listeria_ rarely shows up in produce, but an outbreak linked to
cantaloupe from a Colorado farm has caused at least 72 illnesses,
including up to 16 deaths, in 18 states.

Officials urge those who purchased the potentially tainted product,
which carries a bag and box code of B256-46438-8, to throw it out.
Previously, True Leaf Farms announced the recall of 90 cartons that
were shipped to an Oregon food service distributor. From the
distributor, it might have gone to at least 2 other states, Washington
and Idaho.

The Food and Drug Administration notified the company that a sample
from one bag taken as part of a random check tested positive for
_Listeria_. Federal health officials say they've gotten better at
detecting the germs that cause food poisoning, so they are seeing them
in produce more often.

California health officials are looking into the contamination, said
Ken August, spokesman for the California Department of Public Health,
but have not yet determined how the lettuce became contaminated.
"Anytime there is a contaminated food product, we are concerned and
take steps so that it's removed from shelves as quickly as possible
and to notify consumers," he said. August said the state is working
with the company to verify the distribution of the produce being
recalled. Most of the lettuce was sold to California institutions such
as restaurants and cafeterias, he said, and only a small amount went
to retail in other states, August said.

The Salinas Valley is known as the "Salad Bowl of the World" for its
production of lettuce and numerous other crops. Lettuce currently
picked at the farm is safe to eat, said Steve Church, CEO of Church
Brothers, which sells and markets the farm's produce. The company is
working with the FDA, Church said, to determine if there are any
problems at the farm and is taking more time to sanitize its produce.

[ProMED-mail posts this recall of _Listeria_-contaminated romaine
lettuce, even though no human cases of listeriosis have been
associated with this food product at this time, because of the
potential morbidity and disproportionately high mortality caused by
this food-borne infection (Farber JM, Peterkin PI: _Listeria
monocytogenes_, a food-borne pathogen. Microbiol Rev. 1991; 55(3):
476-511; available at
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC372831. Ramaswamy V,
Cresence VM, Rejitha JS, et al: _Listeria_ -- review of epidemiology
and pathogenesis. J Microbiol Immunol Infect. 2007; 40(1): 4-13;
available at

Listeriosis is especially severe among infants, the elderly, and those
with immune deficiency. _Listeria_ can be passed to a fetus through
the placenta and lead to premature delivery, miscarriage, and
stillbirth. - Mod.ML]
