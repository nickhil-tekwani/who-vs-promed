Farmers face heavy losses due to crop damage in Kapurthala
-----------------------------------------------------------
Farmers in Punjab's Kapurthala District are facing heavy losses as
outbreak of viral disease has lead to large-scale damage of muskmelon
crop. Kapurthala is one of the largest producers of muskmelons in the state.

The viral disease has led not only to stunted growth of the
muskmelons, but also rotting them on the field itself. "I had
cultivated muskmelons on an area of 4 acres (1.6 ha) and most of it
has been destroyed due to the outbreak of a viral disease which has
also hampered the growth of the melons and spoilt them," said Ranjeet
Singh, a farmer.

The losses are so large that they have not been able to even recover
their initial cost and now want the State Government to assist them
financially. According to the experts, the farmers have faced
estimated losses worth about INR 500 million [about USD 11.6 million]
due to the damage to the muskmelon crop. "Thousands of hectares of
area are under muskmelon cultivation in the region, out of which
about 70-90 percent of the cultivation is lost. So, if we calculate
roughly even at INR 25 000 [USD 581] loss per hectare, then according
to the estimate, farmers in Kapurthala have faced a loss of roughly
around 500 million rupees," said Manoj Sharma, agriculture expert.

Out of the damaged crop, the muskmelons that make it to the market
have many less buyers, as people prefer to stay away from the
muskmelons. The farmers are now ploughing their fields to root out
the infested crops and prepare the field for a new crop other than muskmelons.

[More than 15 viruses are known to infect cucurbits, which include
crops like cucumber, all the different kinds of melons, squash, and
pumpkin. Many of the major viruses affecting these crops are
transmitted by aphid species, and some are spread by different
vectors or with seed. Losses occur through reduction in growth and
yield, and the viruses are often also responsible for distortion and
mottling of fruit, making the produce unmarketable.

A new strain of _Cucumber mosaic virus_ (CMV) has been reported
previously to cause diseases of muskmelon in Punjab, India (Sharma et
al. 1984, Phytopath. Z. 109, 332-340). _Zucchini yellow mosaic virus_
(ZYMV) has been reported from the neighbouring Punjab district in
Pakistan on muskmelon and other cucurbits, with an incidence of about
15 percent (see ProMED-mail post no. 20050611.1624), and also on
cucumber in other parts of India (see ProMED-mail post no.
20040731.2088). _Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus_ (CGMMV) was
found to affect muskmelon in several parts of India (Raychaudhuri &
Varma 1978, Phytopath. Z. 93, 120-5). It is not clear from the report
above which virus may be causing the current outbreak. Furthermore,
the current muskmelon crop in Punjab has also been affected by downy
mildew (see recent ProMED-mail post no. 20080411.1322).
