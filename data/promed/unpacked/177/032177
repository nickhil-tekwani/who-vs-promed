Suspected anthrax cases reported in Russia's Altai
--------------------------------------------------
5 of the 14 people recently taken to hospitals in Russia's Altai Territory are showing anthrax-like symptoms. The diagnosis of 3 of these 5 people has already been confirmed by laboratory tests. One of them has died.

One of those hospitalized is a resident of the village of Marushka, and the others live in Druzhba village, a spokesman for the local Healthcare and Pharmaceutical Industry Department told Interfax.

"A vaccination campaign is due to start today. Priority will be given to people working in the agricultural sector," the spokesman said. A total of 130 anthrax vaccine doses have already been delivered from the Altai Territory from Tomsk, and an agreement has been achieved with Omsk regarding another 200 doses.

A meeting between the authorities and local residents will be held in Marushka village, where a man was hospitalized showing anthrax-like symptoms, Tselinny district administration head Nikolai Goncharov told Interfax. "We will speak to all residents at this meeting, explain to them what they should do next. The emergency commission held a session last night. All of the necessary measures were determined," Goncharov said.

Marushka is located near the village of Druzhba, he said.

An anthrax outbreak killed one person in Druzhba and prompted the local authorities to declare a state of emergency and quarantine in the district. District administration officials visited each house in Druzhba and held a meeting with local residents last Sunday. People are not allowed to take any meat or dairy products out of the Tselinny district, where specialists of the consumer rights watchdog Rospotrebnadzor and local veterinary services continue working.

A criminal investigation has been launched in response to the start of the anthrax outbreak in Altai.

[There is an earlier Xinhua report (thank you, Mary) of essentially the same information:

Noting that "a vaccination campaign will begin on Tuesday in the agricultural sector, said the spokesman." Let us hope that is Tuesday 28 Aug 2012 and not 4 Sep 2012. But the deployment of 330 vaccine doses is confusing.

The only time one need consider vaccinating humans in for occupations where exposure is likely, e.g., wool and hair mills handling contaminated materials and historic 'Bradford Disease.' Today that risk is controlled by controlled air flows and careful washing and decontamination of the wool and hair.

In an agricultural community it is by actively discouraging the slaughter and butchering of sick stock, and a proactive livestock control and surveillance programme. If the livestock don't get sick, their humans don't get exposed. Vaccinating humans is both expensive and not cost-effective, and encourages carelessness. And from the description of this outbreak there was a widespread distribution of contaminated meat to a number of villages.

The Altai public health authorities are taking this outbreak seriously but if it is not to re-occur the veterinary services must set up a programme of proactive livestock vaccination in the areas where cases have been seen and in surrounding villages. (There are always cases which do not get reported.) Plus they must get the villagers aware of the need to report unexpected animal deaths so that samples can be taken and diagnoses made promptly. While vaccination should be centered on known outbreaks, surveillance must cover a larger area where the potential exists. In that way the control and surveillance will shrink the area of risk and in a few years remove it.

This is close to areas of Kazakhstan where anthrax outbreaks in livestock are not uncommon.
