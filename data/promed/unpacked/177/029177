Influenza A Virus Outbreak in Adult Residential College; Laboratory Findings
--------------------------------------------------
The influenza A virus outbreak which commenced on Wed 28 May 2003 in
a police residential college in Pretoria has been confirmed to be due
to an outbreak of influenza A (H3N2) virus. Specimens (throat swabs
and bronchial lavages) sent to the National Institute for
Communicable Diseases (NICD) for testing were positive for influenza
H3 by a multiplex nested PCR. The positive specimens are currently
being sequenced to determine the extent of drift from the
A/Panama/2007/99 vaccine strain.
Prior to this outbreak, 9 H3N2 influenza A viruses had been isolated
at the laboratories of the NICD in May and early June 2003. The first
2 influenza A (H3N2) viruses that were detected in South Africa this
season were isolated on 23 and 26 May 2003. The haemagglutinin HA1
subunits of these isolates have been sequenced and appear to have
drifted genetically from the A/Panama/2007/99 vaccine strain, with 15
amino acid changes relative to the vaccine strain. The South African
strains share the characteristic changes at residues 155 (histidine
to threonine) and 156 (glutamine to histidine) seen in some of the
recent [influenza A virus isolates] globally.
The sequencing results from the Pretoria influenza virus strains are
expected in the next few days.

[Dr. Besselaar's rapid response is appreciated. Information on the
extent of genetic drift of the Pretoria isolate relative to the
current vaccine strain and the other South African isolates is
awaited with interest. - Mod.CP]
