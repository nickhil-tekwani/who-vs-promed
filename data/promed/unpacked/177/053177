USDA Revises Georgia Rust Info, North Georgia Growers Warned
-----------------------------------------------
Asian soybean rust [ASR] appears to be spreading vigorously in north
central Putnam County, Georgia, near Eatonton, USDA said early Friday [26
Aug 2005]. In addition, USDA corrected the location of another outbreak.
The report of rust in a sentinel plot in Clarke County on 24 Aug 2005 was
incorrect.
The field was actually in neighboring Oconee County. That is still the
farthest north that ASR has been confirmed in Georgia. In Putnam County,
Dan Philips said that, from the sample collected on 19 Aug 2005, pustules
were found on 82 percent of the leaves from MG II-III-IV (R6-R8 growth
stages) soybeans and on 19 percent of leaves collected from MG VII soybeans
(R3 growth stages).
Phillips is impressed with the spread in the plots. He stated on the USDA
rust information website that soybean growers in north Georgia can expect
ASR in their crop this season [2005]. To date, ASR has been confirmed in
12 Georgia counties.

[The National Map Commentary (updated 26 Aug 2005) shows that Oconee County
in Georgia is the furthest northern location in 2005 where ASR has been
found. Hampton County in South Carolina is the furthest east that ASR has
occurred, while Pearl River County in Mississippi is the furthest west that
ASR has been found in 2005. Alabama now has 12 counties reported positive
with ASR; Florida has 19; Georgia has 12; Mississippi has 2, and South
Carolina has one. Since 15 Jun 2005, there have been 39 new counties
reported with ASR. That is an average of a new county report every 1.8
days, with 29 new county reports in August 2005 alone. New reports for ASR
are expected to continue within states already reporting ASR and potential
adjacent states to the north.
