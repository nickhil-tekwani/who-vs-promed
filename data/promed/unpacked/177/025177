Subject: Streptococcus iniae

_Streptococcus iniae_ was first characterized by Queensland Department of
Primary Industries in 1994-5 in sea-caged barramundi, and I have been
working with it since 1996. Losses, however, are not restricted to just the
sea-cage barramundi, but also those growing in freshwater recirculating
systems. Indeed, in the last year losses in the industry are much higher
from freshwater farms. There is a recent article of mine published on this
in Diseases of Aquatic Organisms 36(3) p177-181.
Since March 1999 I have been working with many other farms throughout
Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia which have also had heavy
losses to this disease, not restricted to barramundi but including Murray
cod and silver perch. This disease has been diagnosed in Australia by at
least 3 independent sources, including government departments. _S. iniae_
was also mentioned in a technical issues paper on the importation of
ornamental finfish into Australia (AQIS).
Furthermore, I have also obtained isolates, from pathology labs, of _S.
iniae_ from workers at 2 of the farms.
The fish kills in North Queensland were widely reported in the media, and
were handled by a local Government department. Their results were
inconclusive about the etiology of the disease, however, my research which
was conducted 3 days earlier with moribund fish (not partially decomposed)
indicated _S. iniae_ was a high candidate for the outbreak (94% isolation
from all animals tested). There was no link made between the disease at the
farms and the wild outbreak. However recent research indicates many of the
fish species found in local waterways carry the bacterium, most importantly
the exotic _Tilapia_ which is found in high numbers in the North.
_S. iniae_ is here, not just in Queensland but throughout Australia, and it
poses a high risk not just to aquaculture but to native fish species in the
wild.
