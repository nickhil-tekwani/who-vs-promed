A 6-year-old local boy living in Shenzhen has become the youngest Hong Kong person to be infected with the H7N9 bird flu virus.

The Centre for Health Protection said the boy developed flu symptoms on 27 Jan 2014 and was given medicine by his family. He visited Hong Kong the next day with his mother and 4 relatives. When he returned to Shenzhen that evening, he was found to have a fever. He tested positive for the potentially deadly virus yesterday, [1 Feb 2014] according to the centre. His symptoms were said to be mild and his condition stable.

The centre said the boy and other members of the group spent most of their time in Hong Kong shopping and did not meet friends or relatives. An immigration officer who came into contact with the boy at the Lo Wu checkpoint will be placed under medical surveillance.

Another case of H7N9 infection was also reported in Guangdong involving a 5-year-old boy in Zhaoqing. He is said to be in a stable condition in a local hospital.

And mainland authorities yesterday [1 Feb 2014] reported that on Friday [31 Jan 2014] an 82-year-old man had died from the virus, also in Guangdong, in the city of Foshan. Meanwhile, a 38-year-old man from Yongzhou in Hunan province was stable after reportedly being infected.

More than 110 cases, over 20 of them fatal, have been reported on the mainland this year [2014]. The Hong Kong government said 43 of them had been in Guangdong. There have been 4 cases in Hong Kong, 3 of them fatal. [A] survivor, an Indonesian domestic helper, left hospital last month [January 2014] after treatment.

[The train of events is consistent with exposure of the child to avian H7N9 influenza virus infection in Shenzhen prior to travel to Hong Kong. Person-to-person transmission of the H7N9 avian virus occurs rarely or never, and it is unlikely that any person in Hong Kong will have contracted infection as a result of contact with him.

Shenzhen is a major city in the south of Southern China's Guangdong Province, immediately north of Hong Kong. The area became China's 1st -- and one of the most successful -- Special Economic Zones (SEZs). It currently also holds sub-provincial administrative status, with powers slightly less than a province. It can be located in the map at http://www.travelchinaguide.com/map/. - Mod.CP
