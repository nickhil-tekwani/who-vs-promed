School doors close due to _E. coli_ alert
-----------------------------------------
A Magherafelt school has closed because of an outbreak of _E. coli_ [O157].
One case has been confirmed and another is suspected at Kilronan Special
School, which is attended by 76 children aged between 4 and 19. Dr Michael
Devine, Northern Board Consultant in Communicable Disease Control, said: "As a
precautionary measure the school has closed while investigations are ongoing. A
source has not been identified. All children attending the school will be
screened before returning to the school."
Dr Devine emphasised the importance of strict hygiene, in particular
handwashing, to prevent the onward spread of infection. Public Health staff
visited the Magherafelt school yesterday, 6 Jun 2005 and were available to
speak to parents and staff. The Department of Public Health Medicine at the
Northern Health Board, Homefirst Community Trust and Environmental Health
colleagues are carrying out the investigation into _E. coli_ O157 infection at
Kilronan Special School.
_E. coli_ is a bacterium which can cause a range of symptoms from a mild
diarrhoea to a more severe illness with bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain and
it is easily transmitted among groups of young children. Kilronan pupils and
staff are being offered screening before returning to school and information
leaflets were yesterday distributed to parents.

[The source of the infection has not been identified, nor whether any of the
cases are secondary. - Mod.LL]
[I believe the term "special school" indicates that the pupils have more or
less severe learning disabilities, and therefore may not be careful about their
personal hygiene. - Mod.JW]
