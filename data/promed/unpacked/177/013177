Mizoram on Thursday [18 Aug 2022] reported its 1st case of Japanese encephalitis (JE), a viral brain infection that spread through mosquito bites. State Nodal Officer of Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP), Dr Pachuau Lalmalsawma, in a statement announced the detection of the JE case from a patient in Aizawl.

He said that the state health department has recently informed the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) about the detection of a suspected JE case in Trinity hospital and asked for a final decision as it will be the 1st JE case in the state. "After perusing the investigation reports of the suspected patient, the NCDC has confirmed the case," Pachuau said in the statement.

Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a flavivirus related to dengue, yellow fever and West Nile viruses, and is spread by mosquitoes called _Culex_. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), JEV is the main cause of viral encephalitis in many countries of Asia with an estimated 68 000 clinical cases every year. Although symptomatic JE is rare, the case-fatality rate among those with encephalitis can be as high as 30%.

According to state health officials, _Culex_ mosquitoes that spread JE virus are common in Mizoram and the safest way to prevent from being infected is to avoid mosquito.

[Although cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) are common in northeastern states of India, this is the 1st report of JE in this state that ProMED has posted. This report does not mention JE vaccine as an effective way to prevent infection and is available in India. Mosquito control is difficult to accomplish over a large area. - Mod.TY]

The death toll due to Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Assam rose to 77 on Thursday [18 Aug 2022] after 2 more fatalities due to the disease were recorded in the state over the past 24 hours. Both the deaths were reported from the Kamrup district, a National Health Mission (NHM), Assam report said.

The 2 fresh cases of the vector-borne disease were reported in the state during the last 24 hours. With this, the total number of JE cases in the state climbed to 377, since the disease took a serious turn during the month of July this year [2022], the report said. Goalpara and Sonitpur districts reported one new case each respectively, it added.

The administrations of all the 35 districts of Assam have formed rapid response teams to combat and control the disease from spreading.

[Cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Assam continue to increase at several locations in this state. Since 1 Jul 2022, the number of deaths has increased to 77.

The number of JE cases has risen rapidly from 183 reported on 19 Jul 2022 to 377 cases on 14 Aug 2022. Interestingly, these 377 cases were classified as JE and not acute encephalitis syndrome.

Although there is still no mention of a vaccination campaign in the state, this report indicates that fogging with insecticide is being done. The current JE virus transmission season may last an additional 2 or more months, so more cases can be expected. - Mod.TY
