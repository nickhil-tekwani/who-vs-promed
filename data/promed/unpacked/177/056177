I ran this through GIDEON. Most of the 16 milk-borne infections which
could occur in Russia are not relevant to the clinical picture described:
brucellosis, campylobacteriosis, diphtheria, tick encephalitis (2 forms),
listeriosis, poliomyelitis, Powassan, Q-fever, rat bite fever,
salmonellosis, shigellosis, staphylococcal food poisoning, tuberculosis,
typhoid, yersiniosis.
The most attractive diagnosis clinically speaking is leptospirosis;
however, I am unaware of recorded milk-borne outbreaks. Theoretically,
rats might urinate in milk... For that matter, Crimea-Congo Hemorrhagic
fever could account for some of these signs and symptoms -- but wrong
season, wrong part of Russia, and (as for leptospirosis) no known history
of milk outbreaks.
Clinically and epidemiologically, the most likely diagnosis is TYPHOID.
Numerous milk-borne outbreaks involving hundreds of fatalities have been
described, even in the 20th century. One would assume, however, that this
was looked for (blood or milk cultures should be positive within 24 to 48
hours), and the human-to-human spread suggested in the Tass article should
not become apparent until at least one or two incubation periods (several
weeks) had gone by. In addition, 'fatal internal bleeding' is a late (3+
weeks) complication of typhoid.
By the way, one should always suspect toxins or poisons. The "metallic
taste" may be caused by metal - mercury, iron, pesticides, etc.
