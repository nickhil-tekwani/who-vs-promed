The torrential rain has caused Kaohsjung dengue-infected mosquito
index to be on the high side. As a part of a public awareness
campaign, the health bureau of the Kaohsiung municipal government
calls upon citizens to eliminate mosquito breeding grounds. The 1st
indigenous dengue case was discovered on 6 Jul 2006. Six additional
cases were detected subsequently in the city, amounting to a total of
7 indigenous dengue cases to date, which include 5 in Qianzeng and 2
in Qianjin districts. All the cases were reported using the existent
reporting mechanism by local hospitals and health stations. The
ovitrap surveillance of dengue-infected mosquitoes has been carried
out between 15 Jun and 12 Jul 2006. It has shown that the
dengue-infected mosquito indices were unusually high. 92 per cent of
the tested areas were over the threshold and at the alarming level.
The health bureau reminds clinicians, especially those in infested
districts, to look out for any suspected cases of dengue fever,
either of local source or imported through overseas traveling. Should
these happen, the clinicians must inform the health authorities. The
former will be awarded a sum of 10 000 NTD [USD 330] and a
certificate of merit as an encouragement. Such incentives are
applicable for the 1st 20 cases only.

Dengue fever may pose an increasing threat to the south of the
country, the Center for Disease Control said yesterday [25 Jul 2006].
After Tropical Storm Bilis struck, the density of mosquitoes
transmitting the illness rose substantially, the center said at a
press conference. Center Deputy Director Lin Ting said there have
been 59 cases of dengue fever this year [2006], of which 17 were
contracted within the country. 15 of these 17 cases were reported in
Cianjhen and Cianjin Districts in Kaohsiung City this summer. The
neighborhoods where the Kaohsiung cases were reported are close to
one another, Lin said. The other 42 cases were contracted abroad,
with most cases coming from Viet Nam, Indonesia, Thailand and the
Philippines, the center said. Senior citizens in northern Taiwan
should also beware of mosquito bites, because the elderly are more
vulnerable to Japanese encephalitis, the center said.

Warning issued on dengue vector
-------------------------------------
The surveillance program on the prevalence of _Aedes albopictus_ -- a
mosquito vector for dengue fever transmission -- has found that 17
out of 20 areas surveyed tested positive for the area ovitrap index
in July 2006.
Food and Environmental Hygiene Department Consultant (Community
Medicine) Dr. Ho Yuk-yin said only 3 of the ovitrap indices were over
10 per cent. Tai Po North stood at 18.5 per cent, Diamond Hill at 14
per cent and Fanling at 11.8 per cent, while indices for the other 14
areas ranged from 1.9 per cent to 7.8 per cent.
While results of the remaining 18 areas are pending, Dr. Ho alerted
people to the likelihood of mosquito breeding during the current rainy period.

Two girls die of dengue fever
---------------------------------
Two girls have died of dengue fever, and another 638 people are sick,
as the mosquito-borne disease spreads rapidly in Surin province, the
local public health office said Tuesday [25 Jul 2006].
The districts of Sanom, Sangkha, Lamduan Jom Phra and the subdistrict
of Sri Narong have reported the highest number of dengue cases ever
recorded in the province, said health office chief, Dr. Khimhan Yongrattanakij.
The 2 girls, aged 9 and 15, died after succumbing to high fever
caused by the disease.
An effort was underway in the province to eradicate mosquito larvae
in water sources. This would minimize the chance of the disease
spreading further, said Dr. Khimhan.

Bird flu killed a teenage boy in northern Thailand yesterday [25 Jul
2006], the 1st reported case in 7 months. The 17-year-old tested
positive for the H5N1 avian flu strain. Thailand's latest case has
[now] been confirmed by the World Health Organization. The youth died
after being admitted to a Phichit hospital on 20 Jul 2006, said
Thawat Suntrajarn, director general of the health ministry's disease
control department, in a telephone interview today [26 Jul 2006]. He
tested positive for both dengue hemorrhagic fever and H5N1 avian flu,
Thawat said.
"He was a unique case" because of the dual infections, Thawat said,
adding that the youth "had a history of touching dead poultry."

The increase in the number of cases in Recife this year [2006] is
worrisome. According to the State Secretary of Health (SES), there
has been a 151 per cent increase in the number of registered cases of
this disease from January to July of this year [2006] compared to the
same period in 2005. According to the Secretariat, 95 per cent of the
neighborhoods of the capital are considered as at high or very high
risk of transmission.
"We have 2 questions that explain this increase: intermittent
availability of water, which obligates people to store water, and
also an increase in use of discarded [water] recipients, which serve
as breeding places for mosquitoes," said Sinara Batista, Director of
the Environmental Health Program of Recife. She explained also that
the collaboration of the population is fundamental to effectively
combat the disease. Water storage containers and other recipients
used to keep water must be covered. An environmental health officer
will go from house-to-house several times each year [to correct] the
same situations.
This year [2006], 4 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever were confirmed,
and another 25 are under investigation.

Over 26 000 cases of dengue have been registered in Rio, but the
Secretariat [of Health] said that the situation was under control.
The State Secretary of Health affirmed today [17 Jul 2006] that Rio
was not living through a dengue epidemic. The Secretary indicated
that the total number of dengue cases reached 26 712, a number 10
times greater than the 2580 dengue cases registered last year [2005].
Of this total [this year? - Mod.TY], 36 were [dengue] hemorrhagic
fever, and more seriously, with 5 deaths. This number does not
include the death of a DHF case in the municipality of Mage, in
Baixada Fluminense, who died this Sunday [16 Jul 2006?], advised the Secretary.
The municipalities most affected are Rio de Janeiro, where there were
12 255 cases with 3 deaths, followed by Angra dos Reis and Parati,
both on the south coast.

Dengue mosquito infestation grew 35 percent in Ribeirao Preto [Sao
Paulo State]. The city has already reported 2182 cases of this
disease this year [2006]
-----------------------------------------------
The infestation index of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, the dengue
vector, increased by 35 percent in Ribeirao Preto compared with the
same period last year [2005]. In 2005, the index was 1.7 per cent,
and now it has reached 2.3 per cent according to the prefecture.
The city has been affected by an epidemic of dengue since October
2005 and has already confirmed 2182 cases.
All parts of the city have been positive for foci of the disease. In
the neighborhoods Jardim California and Jardim Canada, undergrowth
and open sewers are of concern. The mosquitoes are all over the
place. The prefecture affirmed that it is taking measures and that by
the end of 2008, the city sewage will be treated.
Prefectural technicians said that the residents should use insect
repellent and not use insecticides.

[Water containers in and around houses are more likely to be the
significant sites of _Aedes aegypti_ breeding than are open sewers. - Mod.TY]
[It is unclear what "infestation" index was used in the present
study, as there are several larval indices that have commonly been
used to compare population size of _Aedes aegypti_ in different areas
and at different times. The most commonly used larval indices are:
1) House or Premise Index. The percentage of houses, including
examinations of surrounding compounds, that have larvae of _Ae.
aegypti_ in at least some containers.
2) Container or Receptacle Index. The percentage of water-holding
containers that contain larvae of _Ae. aegypti_.
3) Breteau Index. The total number of containers with larvae of _Ae.
aegypti_ per 100 houses.
Another index is the egg index, which detects egg laying. This can be
monitored by using cheap and simple ovitraps that commonly consist of
a strip of absorbent material, e.g. hardboard or velour paper, placed
in a tin can or jar containing water. Female _Ae. aegypti_ deposit
their eggs on the wet strip. The percentage of such traps with eggs
of _Ae. aegypti_ can provide some measure of the relative population
size of the vector.
An excellent publication comparing the different methods of
evaluating infestation levels of _Ae. aegypti_ in northeastern Brazil
is by Morato, V.C.G. et al. (2005) Infestation of _Aedes aegypti_
estimated by oviposition traps in Brazil. Rev. Saude Publica, 39: 553-558.
Further information on larval indices can be found in ProMED archive
number 20060406.1032.
Although it is unclear what index was used in the present study in
Ribeirao Preto, an increase from 1.7 to 2.3 does not seem very large.
The use of indices to reflect population size of _Ae. aegypti_ and
then to relate this with virus transmission is fraught with
difficulties. - Mod.MS]

During the current epidemiological week [9-15 Jul 2006], 920 dengue
cases were diagnosed, of which 65 (7.1 per cent) were hemorrhagic,
with a dengue fever/DHF ratio of 13:1.
The cumulative [number of dengue cases] this year [2006] is 23 733,
of which 5.5 per cent were DHF (1296 cases), with a DF/DHF ratio of 17:1.
The cumulative mortality rate is 89.3 per 100 000 inhabitants. The
[dengue virus] serotypes circulating are 1, 2, 3, and 4. The
cumulative [number of dengue cases] for the current period have
increased by 34.4 per cent, compared to the cumulative number of
cases for the same dates last year [2005] (17 027 cases). During the
current year 2006, no dengue deaths have been reported.

More than 600 dengue cases have been reported in the municipalities
of Cerro, Centro Habana [Central Havana] and Arroyo Naranjo,
according to various employees in the public health sector, who
request anonymity.
Also, there have been meetings with physicians and nurses at zone and
neighborhood levels, in which the authorities are informing people
about the situation and, at the same time, are carrying out tests [on
individuals] in the population who have presented or present symptoms
of the disease.
The Habana Vieja [Old Havana] municipality has begun clean-up of
places that are closed or abandoned with the goal of eliminating
possible foci of _Aedes aegypti_, the mosquito that transmits dengue.
The last time that the Cuban capital was faced with this situation
was in 2002, which resulted in an extensive clean-up campaign of the
city. On that occasion, one million cubic meters of accumulated
garbage and trash was collected from the streets and avenues of the
city of Havana.
