The Samsung Medical Center reports 3 MERS-CoV confirmed patients: expected to decline

- The MoH "MERS Task Force" has announced the confirmation of 8 additional infections on Tuesday (9 Jun 2015) along with another fatality.

Of the 8 newly confirmed cases, 3 were exposed from 27-28 May 2015 in the Samsung Medical Center ED [emergency department], exhibiting symptoms of fever and ataxia. The aforementioned 3 have been confirmed positive for MERS-CoV [infection] and is presumed to be related to case no. 14.

The remaining 5 cases were seen at other medical institutions:

- 2 were exposed on 26 May 2015 at the Asan Medical Center and at the Yeouido St. Mary's respectively, presumed in relation to case no. 6

- 2 were exposed at the Hallym University Dongtan Sacred Heart Hospital on 28-29 May 2015, presumed in relation to case no. 15.

- The remaining patient was confirmed at the Konyang University Hospital, presumed in relation to case no. 16

- The Task Force has also confirmed that the 89th patient spent time at the Gimje Woosuk Medical Center (3 Jun 2015), Gimje Mirae Radiology Clinic (5 Jun 2015), and Gimje Hansol Gastroenterology Clinic (5 Jun 2015) after exposure to the virus at the Samsung Medical Center.

- The Task Force has ordered all past visitors of the above 3 medical institutions to be isolated either in hospitals or their respective homes as a precautionary measure.

- Additionally, it was reported that the case no. 90 received medical treatment at the Okcheon Jeil Clinic after exhibiting flu-like symptoms on 3 Jun 2015, after which he was admitted to Eulji University Hospital ICU after showing signs of respiratory distress on 6 Jun 2015.

- For the patients who have been admitted to a transit hospital or the Eulji University Hospital ICU, a follow up study is being conducted, and the Eulji University Hospital ICU is currently in "cohort quarantine" (Both the hospital ward and the medical professionals are isolated after infected patients have been found).

- The MERS Task Force has also reported one additional fatality (bringing the tally up to 7 total fatalities)

- The fatality was Patient no. 47 (a 68-year-old female) with a history of heart valve disease. The patient was admitted to the Samsung Medical Center's ED between 27 May 2015 and 28 May 2015 after showing signs of respiratory distress, where she came in contact with patient no. 14. Her condition quickly deteriorated after positive confirmation tests, and died while receiving treatment under isolation.

- Samsung Medical Center is currently reporting a decline in the secondary wave of infection within admitted patients, while other medical institutions are still reporting sporadic cases of infection.

- The MERS Task Force also believes this week to be the apex for the further proliferation of the infection, and has announced that they will work at full force to prevent any further cases.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank out volunteer Korean subscribers for assisting us with a translation of the daily MOH report. The machine translations have been suboptimal and we are very lucky now to have a team of Koreans who have volunteered their time to assist us with translations.

According to today's report, there are now a total of 95 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in South Korea including 7 deaths (the official report of the 6th death is in section [2] below). All cases following the index case have been identified as having nosocomial transmission, with several apparent superspreaders -- the index case, case no. 14 and case no. 16, involving 3 healthcare environments where the majority of the transmission took place. In addition, in today's report there were additional cases related to case no.6 and case no.15.

Preliminary analysis of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) sequences from Korea and China - [8 Jun 2015]

Available for download at: http://virological.org/t/preliminary-analysis-of-middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-mers-cov-sequences-from-korea-and-china/143/1

Prepared by members of the WHO-convened "Laboratory Experts for MERS-CoV" with additional data from several research groups (see complete contributors listing in Appendix).

Recent Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) cases in Korea and China are thought to have originated from a virus carried by a traveller returning from the Middle East after visits to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), Bahrain, the United Arabic Emirates and Qatar. A MERS-CoV sequence from a patient in Guangdong has been produced by the Chinese CDC (GenBank KT006149) and the MERSCoV sequence from a patient in Korea (MERS-CoV/KOR/KNIH/002_05_2015, submitted to GenBank) has been produced by the Korea National Institute of Health and Seoul National University.

A preliminary analysis of the 2 viral genomes supports the following conclusions:

1. A strict consensus of the Korean and Chinese MERS-CoV sequences clusters closest with viruses obtained from a recent outbreak in Riyadh in February-March 2015 (1) (Figure 1 [available at URL provided above]). The Chinese and Korean viruses are however divergent enough from the Riyadh 2015 cluster to potentially be derived from a separate zoonotic event in the Arabian Peninsula. Given the travel history of the Korean index patient (2) to other countries with recent MERS-CoV cases, the originating country cannot be determined with certainty. From these data the new MERS-CoVs are unlikely to be phenotypically different from the MERS-CoV currently circulating in the Arabian Peninsula and are unlikely to present different virulence or transmission properties. However, further clinical, epidemiological and viral genetic data will be required to be certain of these preliminary conclusions. In addition, there is an urgency to increase sequencing efforts in all countries where MERS-CoV is circulating. This will increase our knowledge of transmission patterns and inform public health measures required to prevent transmission.

2. The 2 currently available sequences from Korea and China are from patients with a direct epidemiological link and as such are not expected to show many nucleotide differences. However, it is important to note that the Korean sequence was obtained from a cell culture passaged virus, while the Chinese sequence was obtained by direct sequencing of patient swab material. In addition, different error rates and profiles for the sequencing platforms used (Sanger and Ion Torrent for the Chinese sequence versus Illumina for the Korean sequence) and differences in the assembly methods could be a factor. We therefore assume that most of the 22 nucleotide differences between the Korean and Chinese sequences are the result of these technical issues. Further sequencing will clarify this. These considerations led us to use a strict consensus sequence in the analyses above.

3. No shared amino changes in the encoded spike were observed between the Korean and Chinese sequences. If there was a more transmissible virus emerging in Korea/China and this was due to a new spike variant, then one would expect the changes to be shared by the 2 sequences. This was not observed. Additional sequencing of patient samples in Korea will help to resolve the sequence diversity within this cluster.

A strict consensus was created between the Korean and Chinese sequences (marked in red with asterisk), recent virus sequences from Riyadh (Riyadh KKUH 2015) are from (1) and viruses sequences from camels are shown in orange. Colored boxes indicate previously defined clades or lineages. The Al-Hasa hospital outbreak is collapsed for clarity. Clade support is shown where the bootstrap support values were greater than 75 percent. The scale bar is in units of substitutions/site. A maximum-likelihood phylogeny was constructed from the alignment of 171 MERS CoV sequences using RAxML version 7.8.6 under a GTR+G substitution model. Clade support was assessed by bootstrapping with 1000 pseudoreplicates.

[Once again ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Matt Cotten for sharing this report with us. The list of collaborators is impressive and speaks to the urgency that is felt by the health community worldwide in learning more about the MERS-CoV. Yesterday's announcements on the greater than 99 percent homogeneity of the viruses from the Middle East and those involved in South Korea (including the case diagnosed in China) was a simplified description of the interpretation of the results. It is clear the virus came from the Middle East, albeit from where is less clear. The preliminary conclusion on the part of the collaboration team is the variances seen "are unlikely to present different virulence or transmission properties" although further studies are indicated to verify that. - Mod.MPP]

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Republic of Korea 8 Jun 2015
----------------------------
On [6 Jun 2015], the National IHR Focal Point of the Republic of Korea notified WHO of 9 additional confirmed cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

Details of the cases are as follows:

1- A 54-year-old female developed symptoms on 25 May [2015] while admitted to hospital for an unrelated medical condition since 19 May [2015]. From 19 to 20 May [2015], the patient was admitted to the same ward where the 1st case had been hospitalized. Between 21 and 28 May [2015], she was transferred to a different floor. The floor is where several laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases have been notified later. The patient, who has comorbidities, was isolated in the nationally designated hospital and tested positive for MERS-CoV on 29 May [2015].

2- A 40-year-old male developed symptoms on [1 Jun 2015]. On 27 May [2015], the patient visited his son while he was admitted to hospital. During this time, he stayed in the same zone as a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case that was reported in a previous DON on [1 Jun 2015] (case n. 1) [South Korea case no.14]. The patient tested positive for MERS-CoV and was isolated in the nationally designated hospital on [2 Jun 2015].

3- A 68-year-old female developed symptoms on [2 Jun 2015]. The patient sought medical care for unrelated medical conditions on 27 May [2015]. She visited the emergency room of a hospital and went back home after treatment. At the hospital, the patient stayed in the same zone as a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case that was reported in a previous DON on [1 Jun 2015] (case n. 1) [South Korea case no.14]. She was notified about the exposure to the case, and told to self-quarantine at home and wear a mask. On [2 Jun 2015], when symptoms appeared, the patient went to the emergency room of another hospital where she was treated in the isolation area. The patient was later transferred to another hospital for further treatment and admitted to an isolation room in ICU. She tested positive for MERS-CoV on [4 Jun 2015].

4- A 65-year-old developed symptoms on [1 Jun 2015] but did not have any respiratory symptoms. Between 28 and 30 May [2015], the patient went to a hospital. During this time, he stayed in the emergency room and at the same ward as a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case that was reported in a previous DON on [4 Jun 2015] (case n. 1) [South Korea case no.16]. The patient was isolated in the hospital on [2 Jun 2015] and was transferred to a negative pressure room on [3 Jun 2015]. He tested positive for MERS-CoV on [3 Jun 2015].

5- A 24-year-old, female health professional developed symptoms on [29 May 2015]. She attended patients on a floor where several laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases stayed. She was isolated at home on 28 May [2015]. The patient, who has no comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [5 Jun 2015].

6- A 51-year-old female developed symptoms on [1 Jun 2015]. Between 18 and 28 May [2015], the patient was admitted to a hospital that reported several MERS-CoV cases. She was isolated on [1 Jun 2015]. The patient tested positive for MERS-CoV on [5 Jun 2015].

7- A 39-year-old male developed symptoms on 31 May [2015]. The patient visited his wife while she was admitted to the emergency room of a hospital. His wife was admitted to the same room as a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case that was reported in a previous DON on [1 Jun 2014] (case n. 1) [South Korea case no.14]. He tested positive for MERS-CoV on [4 Jun 2015].

8- A 75-year-old male tested positive for MERS-CoV on [4 Jun 2015]. On 27 May [2015], the patient attended the emergency room of a hospital that reported several laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases. Further investigation is ongoing.

9- An 81-year-old female tested positive for MERS-CoV on [4 Jun 2015]. On 27 May [2015], the patient went to the emergency room of a hospital that reported several laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases. Further investigation is ongoing.

Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for the cases.

So far, a total of 50 MERS-CoV cases, including 4 deaths, have been reported to WHO by the National IHR Focal Point of the Republic of Korea. One of the 50 cases is the case that was confirmed in China and also notified by the National IHR Focal Point of China.

Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1204 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 448 related deaths.
