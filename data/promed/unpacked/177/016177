The strain of bacteria that caused a fatal outbreak of legionnaires' disease in the Veterans Affairs [VA] hospital in Oakland is "almost identical" to the bug that caused a lethal outbreak there more than 30 years ago, according to documents obtained by the Tribune-Review. [The VA Oakland campus is located in Oakland, a neighborhood in the city of Pittsburgh, where the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center is also located (http://www.alleghenycounty.us/veterans/stars.aspx).]

The _Legionella_ bacteria, linked to 5 deaths and possibly a sixth, might have survived in the water system at the University Drive hospital since 1982 despite decades of hot-water flushes, cycles of chemical disinfectant, and the installation of a copper-silver ionization system designed to kill it, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report issued in January [2013].

Bacteria that the CDC found in October [2012] when investigating the most recent outbreak match 5 of 7 genes with the 1982 bacteria. "This indicates the _Legionella_ found in the hospital in 1982 is almost identical to the _Legionella_ found in this outbreak, suggesting that the pathogenic strain may have persisted in the hospital's water system for many years," the CDC said.

Layers of slime and calcium in pipes could shelter the bacteria, said Janet Stout, a microbiologist who worked on the research team that responded to the 1982 outbreak. "It's never completely killed because, as you can imagine, a water distribution system has many pipes, many sections" that disinfecting treatments might not reach, said Stout, who later worked in the VA Oakland pathogens lab before it was abruptly closed. VA spokesman David Cowgill declined to comment, citing "pending investigations and legal claims." The VA Inspector General's Office and a subcommittee under the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs are separately reviewing the outbreak. US Attorney David J Hickton in Pittsburgh pledged to look into it when the inspector general's report is completed in March [2013].

The family of a veteran said it plans to sue the VA. [The veteran], 87, died of legionnaires' disease in November [2012] in the Oakland hospital.

The recent outbreak in the VA's Oakland and O'Hara facilities sickened as many as 21 patients from January 2011 through October 2012. Five of them died within 30 days of testing positive for legionnaires' disease, an acute respiratory infection. [The VA HJ Heinz campus is located in O'Hara Township, a few miles northeast of Pittsburgh (http://www.pittsburgh.va.gov/HJ_heinz.asp).] Another veteran infected with _Legionella_ died in January [2013] in the Oakland hospital, but tests have yet to show where the patient contracted the bacteria.

The CDC did not test the water in the VA's HJ Heinz campus in O'Hara. Asked whether _Legionella_ found in the VA Butler facility's water in December [2012] were the same strain as that which caused the Oakland outbreak, the CDC referred questions to the Butler VA. [The Butler VA is located in Butler, a city 35 miles (56 km) north of Pittsburgh.]

Amanda Kurtz, spokeswoman for the Butler VA, said she was "checking on the answer" on Friday afternoon [22 Feb 2013] but did not later respond.

The previous outbreak in VA Oakland occurred during a 3-year period ending in 1982, when the hospital diagnosed about 100 cases of legionnaires' disease -- 30 percent of them fatal, Stout said. Dr Victor Yu led the 1982 research team for the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, which fired him in 2006. The VA should have known this strain lurked in its water system and done more to monitor it, Yu said. "We know that it will come back if we don't monitor it," Yu told the Trib. "They should've monitored, but they didn't, and that's the whole scandal -- but you already know that."

Epidemiologists say it's not surprising that the bacteria strain survived for so long in the hospital's water system. What sets this strain apart, however, is the key role it played 30 years ago in helping scientists learn how to detect and prevent outbreaks of legionnaires' disease. From the disease's discovery -- as a result of a 1976 outbreak in the Bellevue-Stratford hotel in Philadelphia -- until the 1982 study of the outbreak in the VA in Oakland, doctors believed mist from building cooling towers was the primary culprit in spreading legionnaires' disease, Stout said. In Pittsburgh, though, the disease occurred year-round, even when air conditioning was not in use. Yu, Stout, and other Pittsburgh VA researchers tied the infections to the Oakland hospital's water system, Stout said. "It was a game changer," said Stout, who left the VA 6 years ago to co-found with Yu the Special Pathogens Laboratory, Uptown.

Because of the 1982 study by the Pittsburgh VA researchers, doctors look first to water systems when testing and preventing legionnaires' disease, she said. Dr Lauri Hicks, a CDC epidemiologist, said the bacterium in the recent outbreak could be considered a "granddaughter or grandson" of the 1982 strain. The CDC has not seen this strain elsewhere, Hicks said. "That was very important because it was very clear, given what we had from the patients and what we had from the environment, that this was a health care-associated outbreak. We have not investigated other outbreaks with that same strain," Hicks said.

Dr Ronald Voorhees, acting chief of the Allegheny County Health Department, said the recent outbreak in the Oakland VA points to the need for national standards to monitor and treat water-distribution systems in health care facilities. "Unfortunately, there's not a national standard to say, 'This is what you should do to minimize the problem,' " Voorhees said. "People are trying different methods, and different methods are going to have different requirements." _Legionella_ bacteria tend to survive in pipes, trapped in thin layers of microorganisms called biofilms, he said. "It's there, and it will re-establish itself, which is why treatments either have to be continuous or periodic to try to knock it back down," Voorhees said. "But you never completely get rid of it."

Because of that, hospitals that experience _Legionella_ outbreaks should step up surveillance and testing, according to an August 2005 paper in the American Journal of Infection Control co-authored by the late Allegheny County Health Department Chief Bruce Dixon, who died on Wednesday [20 Feb 2013]. In his last interview with the Trib on 13 Feb [2013], Dixon advocated aggressive monitoring for _Legionella_, including testing hospital water systems, even if the disease was not identified in patients. "They tried to minimize and obfuscate the problem," Dixon said of the Pittsburgh VA system. "If I were associated with the VA, I'd be embarrassed as to what came out."

[The news report above refers to testimony before the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the United States House of Representatives on 5 Feb 2013, given by a CDC official concerning the CDC investigation of legionnaires' disease (LD) among patients at the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System (VAPHS), which is available at http://www.cdc.gov/washington/testimony/2013/t20130205.htm. This testimony has been abbreviated, edited, and summarized below:

The VAPHS serves the veteran population throughout the tri-state area of Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia, and has 3 campuses in Pittsburgh (http://www.cdc.gov/washington/testimony/2013/t20130205.htm.) The University Drive campus is a 150 bed acute-care hospital that opened in 1954 and provides inpatient and outpatient services. The HJ Heinz campus houses primary care clinics, a long-term care facility, substance abuse program, and dental rehabilitation. The Highland Drive campus serves only administrative functions.

VAPHS used copper-silver ionization to control _Legionella_ in its water distribution system (http://www.cdc.gov/washington/testimony/2013/t20130205.htm.) The process of copper-silver ionization releases positively-charged copper and silver ions into the water, which form electrostatic bonds with negatively charged bacteria cell walls. This bond is thought to disrupt bacterial cell walls and lead to cell death.

Timeline of the CDC investigation of the outbreak at the VAPHS:
- 5 Oct 2012: the Pennsylvania Bureau of Laboratories contacted the CDC _Legionella_ laboratory to request subtyping of some _Legionella_ isolates at the VAPHS.
- 12 Oct 2012: CDC received 2 clinical isolates and one environmental isolate for DNA sequence-based typing (SBT), that is, genotyping.
- 29 Oct 2012: CDC reported preliminary results indicating a link between these 2 cases of LD with onsets of illness on 25 Aug and 27 Aug 2012 and an environmental _Legionella_ isolate collected from the VAPHS University Drive Campus on 3 Oct 2012.
- 5 Nov 2012: a conference call was held with CDC, VAPHS, and others and, upon learning of the results, the VAPHS Director promptly requested a visit from the CDC.
- 2 Nov 2012: PA DOH [Pennsylvania Department of Health] requested an Epi-Aid [epidemic assistance investigation] and the field investigation, which began on 7 Nov 2012 and lasted until 16 Nov 2012.

The CDC identified 5 definitely and 16 probably healthcare-associated cases of legionnaires' disease (LD), for a total of 21 cases that occurred between 1 Jan 2011 and 31 Oct 2012. All 21 cases had _Legionella_ urinary antigen testing (which is a test that is able to identify only type of _Legionella_, _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1) performed and 9 of these also had _Legionella_-specific culture performed. In 13 cases, the exposure was only to the University Drive campus, in 2 cases only to the Heinz campus, and in 6 cases to both.

29 of 44 environmental samples collected by the CDC field team in November 2012 showed growth of _Legionella_. _Legionella_ grew from samples collected from various locations throughout the potable water system, including from all samples collected from sites immediately after the copper-silver systems, indicating widespread _Legionella_ colonization throughout the hospital.

Clinical _Legionella_ isolates from 3 cases were identical and matched environmental isolates collected from multiple locations in the hospital's potable water system. This strain of _Legionella_ was the outbreak strain. There were several other types of _Legionella_ found in addition to the outbreak strain. Also, a sample from the sand filter of the decorative fountain at the entrance showed growth of the outbreak strain; therefore the fountain cannot be ruled out as a potential source of exposure for some cases.

There was persistence of a highly pathogenic strain of _Legionella_ in the potable water system despite copper-silver ionization and intermittent superheating during the past 2 years. At the time of the CDC investigation, the copper and silver levels in the water were appropriate for controlling _Legionella_ according to the manufacturer's recommendations and the hospital's protocol. However, these same samples still tested positive for _Legionella_, indicating that the copper-silver ionization system was not controlling _Legionella_ growth. The diversity of species, serogroups, and serotypes among _Legionella_ isolates makes resistance to copper-silver ionization an unlikely explanation for amplification within the system, and points to an environment adequate for _Legionella_ growth, indicating a systemic problem that was not being controlled by the copper-silver ionization system at the time of sample collection.

The hospital collected small volumes (100 ml) of water for routine culture-based monitoring of the potable water system for _Legionella_. Compared to the 1 L volumes recommended by CDC, this smaller volume likely resulted in decreased sensitivity to detect widespread colonization of the potable water system.

The hospital relied upon an action threshold (30 percent of distal sites positive) to prompt remediation. Cases occurred when sampling indicated that less than 30 percent of sites were colonized. A recent review determined that the 30 percent threshold provides both low specificity (74 percent) and sensitivity (59 percent) for legionellosis risk assessment. CDC's records on known outbreaks from 2011 revealed 2 outbreaks where legionnaires' disease cases occurred after exposure to building water systems with _Legionella_ positivity at less than 30 percent of distal sites.

The hospital has been undergoing extensive construction. The timing of construction work at the hospital coincides with the outbreak. Construction likely introduced organic matter to the potable water system, increasing consumption of chlorine in the municipal water supply leading to amplification of _Legionella_. Residual chlorine in the water system, although at adequate levels in the incoming municipal water supply, was at an insufficient concentration for microbicidal activity at all distal sites measured within the hospital.

The hospital did not recognize healthcare-associated cases of LD for an extended period of time. A low index of suspicion that lab-confirmed cases were healthcare-acquired can be partially attributed to a perception of _Legionella_ control in the hospital water systems. The cases reported to county and state public health offices were not recognized to be healthcare-associated and part of an outbreak. This may be due to a high baseline prevalence of legionnaires' disease in Pittsburgh.

CDC made some initial recommendations to stop disease transmission, which included:
- minimize patient exposure to potable water sources by restricting patient showering, restricting drinking from potable water sources, installing point-of-use filters for faucets and showerheads, and turning off all decorative water features and whirlpool spas until remediation strategies have been shown to be effective; and
- implement short-term systematic potable water system remediation as referenced in American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc. ASHRAE Guideline 12-2000 (Minimizing the risk of legionellosis associated with building water systems, 2000) by hyperchlorination to greater than or equal to 2 parts per million (ppm) at all distal sites and flushing at all points of use, and/or superheating and flushing of the potable water system to 160-170 degrees.

CDC also recommended enhanced testing and surveillance for LD to identify any new cases and, for long-term _Legionella_ control measures, eradication of _Legionella_ from the potable water system, as there is no known safe level of _Legionella_. The hospital should continue testing for _Legionella_ every 2 weeks for 3 months, and then every month for 3 months to ensure remediation has been effective. If any _Legionella_ is detected during this time frame, remediation throughout the facility will need to be adjusted and the testing cycle must start over.

Close communication among hospital staff and between the hospital and public health would improve surveillance. The _Legionella_ control protocols of the hospital, the Veterans Health Administration, and the Allegheny County Health Department should be carefully reevaluated to include changes in surveillance methodology, including action thresholds and sampling methods.

Conclusion
----------
The VAPHS has rapidly implemented CDC's recommendations and has taken several steps to protect patient safety. The hospital shut down their potable water system on 15 Nov 2012 to initiate remediation. Meanwhile, a combination of bottled water and point-of-use filters were used for patient care needs. Superheating and hyperchlorination were performed, followed by installation of a chlorine drip to maintain the chlorine level at approximately 1-2 ppm throughout the system. Repeat sampling 2 weeks later showed that remediation was successful, and water usage restrictions were lifted on 30 Nov 2012 and the VAPHS declared the water system clear of _Legionella_. To date, no further LD cases have been detected.
