The Emergency Response Research Institute (ERRI) posted this recommended
response protocol several weeks ago. More information can be found at their
web site (www.emergency.com).
Effective Date: 11/19/98 - 13:00CST Responder Safety Advisory - Response
to Known/Suspected Anthrax Incidents By C. L. Staten, ERRI Executive
Director and Senior Analyst
A recent rash of anthrax "hoaxes" have occurred throughout the Mid-West,
Northeast, and Southeast. In consideration of a review of the currently
available information regarding the emergency response thereto, ERRI would
like to respectfully suggest the following operating procedures when
responding to a threat of or to a known or suspected incident involving
"biological, chemical, or nuclear agents":
1> The first arriving unit, be it from a police, fire, or EMS agency,
should attempt to isolate and evacuate the area where the suspected
mail/package is found. Treat the area where the mail/package is found as a
"hot zone" until proved otherwise by competent authorities. All personnel
evacuated from this "hot zone" should be decontaminated, medically
evaluated, and debriefed by law enforcement authorities before being
transported to the hospital for further evaluation.
2> Handling of mail or packages that are suspected of containing potential
chemical or biological materials should be kept to a absolute minimum. This
is important from both an evidenciary standpoint, as well as trying to
reduce the number of people that are potentially exposed to a toxic agent.
This particularly true of emergency responders, who in past incidents have
reportedly handled suspect letters or showed them to other
personnel/agencies on the scene. Emergency personnel should also be
cautious that the letter/package could be "booby-trapped" or of the
possibility of a secondary explosive device in the vicinity. [The latter
refers to the "small bomb - big bomb" scenario where the first attracts
crowds &/or experts, the second blows them all away. Nasty but very
effective. - Mod.MHJ
3> At the earliest opportunity, activate a response of local and/or mutual
aid hazardous materials units. Unless proven otherwise safe, personnel
handling any suspected chemical, biological, or nuclear materials should
wear fully-encapsulated suits and self-contained breathing apparatus (Level
A). Institute a complete hazardous materials management plan. Depth of
resources becomes paramount in extended operations involving chem/bio
reconnaissance and decontamination, Call for help soon and request
sufficient numbers of the needed resources.
4> In incidents involving a known or suspected "weapons of mass
destruction" (WMD), it is recommended that an early response of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) be requested. According to the national
response plan and Presidential directives, the FBI is the lead federal
agency in crisis management concerning chemical, biological, or nuclear
weapons. In most jurisdictions, the FBI can be easily contacted by local
police agencies. FBI offices can also contact and activate needed federal
agencies and personnel, like the CDC, USAMIIRID, Army Technical Support
Unit, National Guard RAID teams, or Marine CBIRF, if needed.
5> A review of the B'nai B'rith Anthrax hoax incident that took place on
April, 24, 1997 in Washington, DC would suggest the necessity of setting up
an effective multi-jurisdictional command post to coordinate the actions of
all the agencies on the scene. Set one up at the earliest
opportunity...you'll need it.
6> Although several recent incidents, allegedly involving "anthrax," have
all proven to be hoaxes ... do not become complacent or take any suspected
WMD incident lightly. Every incident must be treated as though it were the
real thing until proven fraudulent. To do otherwise could easily result in
the unnecessary illness or death of citizens or emergency responders.
7> Be prepared for massive interest by the media. Past incidents have drawn
reporters, helicopters, and mini-cams from miles around. Institute an
effective Public Information effort early in the incident. This will help
to minimize panic on the part of civilians and be beneficial to better
overall scene management activities. Particularly in urban areas, ensure
that someone contacts the FAA to "clear the airspace" over a potential or
real WMD release scene. Hovering news helicopters could rapidly spread a
chemical or biological agent to a much larger area.
8> It should be remembered that 911 dispatchers must be involved in this
entire process, as they will take the initial reports and are in a vital
position to ascertain details that will aid investigators and/or alert
responders to the possibility of a potential WMD incident. They will also
be in the midst of recording and coordinating an effective
multi-jurisdictional response to the incident. Dispatchers must be trained
in WMD recognition and be familiar with responders' objectives and
responsibilities, if they are to effectively and professionally assist in
the managed command, communications, and effective mitigation of the
incident.
9> Above all, once an incident is underway, it is far too late to formulate
an effective terrorism/WMD plan. This is a task that will require months of
assessment, training, planning, and the purchase of appropriate equipment.
Obviously, a real WMD release will quickly become a complex and difficult
task involving far more than the brief information contained herein. It is
strongly recommended that awareness and preparation for this eventuality
should be underway in all communities at this time.

From: FRANK MYERS III <FRANKM@MERCYSD.COM>

I was surprised by the moderators suggestion that "first responders" i.e.
HAZMAT and EMS personnel be vaccinated. This would seem from my perspective
to be a poor use of resources.
Vaccinating "first responders" ignores an important fact. The area where a
bioterrorist attack occurs is generally not identified by the terrorist
group either before or during the attack. The area of attack is also not
immediately evident (unless a toxin is used). The Bhagwan Cult attacks in
1986 and the failed Aum Shinrikyo (biological not chemical) attempts both
demonstrate this fact. This differs from chemical attacks where the area of
attack is obvious. It also differs from hoax biological attacks where
visibility can only be gained by the threat of the use of a weapon and
therefore publicity is maximized by selecting a highly visible site for the
hoax, announcing it and trying to provide credible evidence of an attack (a
petri dish, a box, etc.).
This behavior of announcing the attack before or as it occurs is largely
self-defeating if the agent is treatable (i.e. anthrax). Although this
modus operandi could be effective in actual targeted individual attacks if
the agent is untreatable.
In an actual attack, in order to maximize "terror" and thus maximize
visibility it is best for a group to wait until after the attack but before
cases become apparent and not to disclose the area where the attack
occurred. Thus they can make their claim of responsibility credible by
predicting the cases that will soon be but are not yet apparent, not allow
the potential victims to be identified and thus prophylaxed and make a
large segment of the population fearful that they were at the site of the
attack thus beginning to overwhelm authorities ability to respond before
the damage of the attack is revealed.
In this scenario first responders (HAZMAT, EMS) play no role in the event
with the possible exception of EMS transporting victims to acute care
facilities. Most biologicals that are likely terrorist agents (anthrax,
tularemia, Q fever, biological toxins, and VEE) will not be transmitted to
the EMS personnel if standard precautions are followed. Obviously the other
agents such as smallpox, pneumonic plague and to a much lesser degree the
VHFs would have a significant possibility of transmission to EMS personnel.
Only in the case of these diseases would vaccination make sense.

[I am sorry but I disagree. If I were involved in HAZMAT activities I would
want my people (BritSpeak for staff) to have been vaccinated *before* any
possible exposure, even if it were to be of low risk as Frank describes.
Plus it will give them extra confidence and security of mind, and thus they
will be more efficient and calmer. I was brought up to treat one's people
as you would want to be in the same circumstances and so to pose the
question: "Would YOU want to go into a potential WMD event unvaccinated?" I
doubt it. And then there are the little matters of insurance and legal
liability.
This thread has a limited life span, if for no other reason that in spite
of the ERRI protocol the optimum response is evolving and still being
developed in the light of experience by different groups. Theirs was one
solution at one point in time. Also the perception of actual threat ranges
all the way from the quasi-military down to the bumbling militiaman. And
presumably there must be limits on the extent of public discussion by those
with response responsibilities, even with a knowledgeable group such as
ProMED-mail.
Martin Hugh-Jones, ProMED AHEAD moderator
[Actually, having the benefit of a thoughtful emergency response plan, and
the differing points of view of two very knowledgeable people concerning
vaccination, I think it appropriate to cut this thread. - Mod.ES
