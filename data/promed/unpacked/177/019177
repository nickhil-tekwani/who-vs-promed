Hong Kong begins preemptive poultry cull to halt avian influenza outbreak
-------------------------------------------
HONG KONG: The Hong Kong authorities on Mon 21 May 2001 initiated a 2 week
operation to slaughter more than one million poultry at local farms
following the new outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza. An official at the
Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department said the cull would
cover 208 farms rearing chickens, pigeons, and quail, although there was no
evidence yet of these farms being contaminated. "But since retail outlets
have already been closed and will remain so for 3 to 4 weeks, there is a
need to destroy local chickens, pigeons and quail which will reach
marketable age during the time the retail outlets are closed," said
department director Lessie Wei.
About 300 people would take part in the operation to gas 1.06 million
poultry using carbon dioxide, he said. The total comprised 850 000
chickens, 140 000 pigeons, and 70 000 quail. Meanwhile, Environment and
Food Secretary Lily Yam, told legislators that the source of the H5N1 avian
influenza outbreak had yet to be determined. She repeated the government's
proposal to set up a central slaughterhouse for poultry to prevent future
outbreaks but warned that the people of Hong Kong must try to change their
fondness for fresh meat. Food and Environmental Hygiene Department Director
Rita Lau told reporters that the government was considering a ban on new
licences for on-street fresh provision shops. Yam also turned down demands
by poultry vendors to compensate them more while they were kept out of
business until July.
Her comments came as a dozen poultry retailers staged a protest outside the
legislature building to voice their opposition to a central slaughterhouse.
The industry fears that a central slaughterhouse could undermine the
livelihood of 20 000 chicken sellers in Hong Kong. The latest avian
influenza cull operation will cost 30 million Hong Kong dollars (3.86
million US), including compensation to poultry vendors. The government
ordered the mass slaughter of 1.2 million chickens and other birds on Fri
18 May 2001 after [avian influenza H5N1 virus had been found at 3 Hong
Kong markets on Wed 16 May 2001. Since then, 134,000 birds, including
chickens, geese, ducks and pigeons, have been killed at poultry stalls,
which have been ordered shut [throughout the territory.
The authorities have stressed that the virus is different from the H5N1
strain responsible for the outbreak in 1997 in which 6 people died. LC
Chan, an executive of Guangnan Hong, a Chinese firm that exports live
poultry to Hong Kong, denied reports that the source of the latest avian
influenza outbreak could have come from the mainland. Chan told reporters
that all poultry entering the Hong Kong SAR had to undergo random blood
tests; a measure adopted after the 1997 bird flu scare. Chan said the
latest bird flu could be due to the unhygienic situations of some markets
in Hong Kong as well as illegal local poultry farms selling bird
flu-infected chickens into the markets. Chan's firm claims to have lost 130
million dollars in business deals since the mass slaughter of chickens as
it exports up to 120 000 poultry a day to Hong Kong.
