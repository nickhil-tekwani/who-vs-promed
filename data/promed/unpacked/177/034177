A measles outbreak is occurring in Switzerland. According to a Swiss
website for health professionals <http://www.tellmed.ch/>, 414
measles cases were notified since January 2007. 236 of these cases
occurred in the Canton of Luzern, an area where measles immunisation
coverage is only 78 percent, whereas the national immunisation rate
is 86 percent. So far, most of the 414 cases were children or
adolescents: 334 were <19 years of age (113 in the age group 5-9
years and 92 in the age group 10-14 years). Almost all cases (about
95 percent) were unvaccinated.
Swiss health authorities are concerned because of a relatively high
rate of complications during the current outbreak: one in 10 people
was hospitalized, and severe complications like encephalitis or
pneumonia have been observed.
The outbreak is not yet over: in June 2007, at least as many cases as
in May 2007 were notified. Measles cases were also notified in other
areas of Switzerland this year [2007]: 61 in Bern, 34 in Genf
(Geneva), 16 in Zurich and 14 in Zug.
In 2002, the WHO Regional Office for Europe developed and implemented
a strategic plan targeting the elimination of measles and the
prevention of congenital rubella infection for the year 2010. Measles
incidence has decreased in Europe during the past 10 years owing to
the introduction of a 2nd dose of the measles, mumps and rubella
(MMR) vaccine into routine immunisation programs. Nevertheless,
elimination is not yet achieved: even in recent years, despite the
implementation of measles-elimination efforts, outbreaks have been
reported throughout EU countries, including Germany (1,2), United
Kingdom (3), Spain (4), Denmark and Sweden (5), Greece (6) and Italy
(7,8). These outbreaks occurred especially in communities with lower
immunisation rates; in some instances, the outbreak was related to
measles virus importation through international travels.

This latest outbreak in Lucerne reminds us that the goal of 95
percent measles coverage continues to elude this region of Europe. See graph at
