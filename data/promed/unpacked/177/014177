MENINGITIS, MENINGOCOCCAL: VENEREAL TRANSMISSION
************************************************
A ProMED-mail post
Date: Wed, 04 Mar 1998 12:07:48 -0800
From: Paul Millikin <millikin@mtco.com>

Dogma has it that _Neisseria meningitidis_ inhabits the mouth and pharynx
and somehow invades the blood stream and meninges from there. However,
_Neisseria meningitis_ can also infect the urethra and uterine cervix, as
shown
by the references below.
There is documentation of its transfer from mouth to urethra via oral sex,
so why not transfer from urethra to mouth via the same mechanism? I could
find no data on transfer from mouth to mouth, i.e. by kissing, but that seems
at least theoretically possible. In other words, the evidence strongly
suggests that [meningococcal] meningitis may sometimes be acquired
venereally, from
urethra to mouth to blood and meninges.
Conceivably that information might be useful to any physician who is faced
with a meningitis outbreak among young people, as on university campuses or
in armed forces basic training centers. That's one situation where temporary
abstinence might be a helpful control measure, provided the students or
recruits were made aware of it.
Incidentally, correct identification of the organism in acute male urethritis
might occasionally save a marriage, when the organism is _N. meningitidis_
from
the wife's throat rather than _N. gonorrheae_ from extracurricular sources.
Does anyone have any personal experience with such an outbreak?
