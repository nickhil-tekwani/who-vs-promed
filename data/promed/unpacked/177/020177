A number of sheep carcasses have been "deemed unfit for the food chain" following the detection of what is believed to be sarcocystosis.

The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine confirmed that the sheep originated from a farm in Co. Donegal.

In a statement, the department outlined that it "operates a comprehensive system of ante and post-mortem veterinary inspection on all animals slaughtered in Irish meat plants". Only meat from those animals that pass both inspections are eligible for the food chain. Where animals fail to meet the required standards, they are excluded from the food chain.

Meanwhile, in the weeks leading up to the middle of June last year [2017], it was confirmed that over 400 lamb carcasses had to be destroyed due to an outbreak of sarcocystosis. It was alleged that this outbreak also originated on a farm in Co. Donegal [see 20170625.5129440].

Sarcocystosis causes cysts to form on the host's muscles. The cysts vary in size from a few micrometers to a few centimeters, depending on the host and species. Humans, horses, cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, birds, rodents, and reptiles can all contract the disease.

The disease is believed to develop in the host for between one and 2 weeks after it ingests muscle tissue that contains sarcocystis cysts, the final host will then begin to shed the infective parasites in its faeces; shedding continues for several months. The disease can generally only be definitively diagnosed following a post-mortem.

[Sarcocystosis infections in humans and animals are caused by single-celled protozoan parasites in the family of Sarcocystidae. _Sarcocystis_ spp. have an obligatory 2-host life-cycle with a prey animal serving as the intermediate host and a predator serving as the definitive host. While most species are infective only to animals, humans can act as incidental intermediate hosts in a variety of spp., and as definitive hosts in 2 species, _S. suihominis_ and _S. bovihominis_.

Human muscular sarcocystosis infections tend to be rare, and intestinal infections are often asymptomatic or very mild. Because the parasite is transmitted either fecal-orally or by the ingestion of undercooked meat containing sarcocysts, transmission can be easily prevented by simple changes in hygienic practices.

The above and additional information on sarcocystis is available at https://web.stanford.edu/group/parasites/ParaSites2004/Sarcocystis/.
