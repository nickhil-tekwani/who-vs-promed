[1] No cluster in Cikelet, West Java

According to health officials in Indonesia, no evidence has been found of
human-to-human transmission of H5N1 bird flu in the remote villages of West
Java which have witnessed the latest outbreak of the deadly virus. This has
been confirmed by the World Health Organization (WHO) <http://www.who.int/>.
Two people have died and a third is still ill from a villages in Cikelet in
Garut district.
I Nyoman Kandun, the Health Ministry's Communicable Disease Control Center
Director, says investigations have also shown there was no "cluster" of
cases in the villages. To date there have been 18 suspected bird flu cases
in Cikelet, and 5 other suspected cases died before swabs were taken to
determine the cause of death.
A 6-year-old girl was also confirmed positive for H5N1 in Jatiasih district
in Bekasi; she developed symptoms on 6 Aug 2006 and was hospitalized on 11
Aug 2006 and remains hospitalized but is recovering. The source of her
infection is currently under investigation and the case takes the nation's
total for human infection to 62 since June 2005, with 47 fatalities. [As of
13 Aug 2006 the WHO has confirmed only 60 cases and 46 deaths. - Mod.CP].
Test results are pending for 5 others receiving medical treatment for
symptoms of the disease.
The disease appears to have been brought into Cikelet 3 months earlier with
live chickens purchased from an outside market, and chickens began dying
shortly afterwards, with the outbreak spreading through the villages in the
area.
Experts are always concerned when there appears to be a cluster of
infection, i.e. when a group of people are infected from the same source.
Scientists believe clusters of cases raise the likelihood of H5N1 mutating
into a form easily passed between humans that could spark a global flu
pandemic with a the potential to kill millions. A total of 3500 poultry had
been culled in 5 areas within a one-kilometer radius of Garut and tests
have confirmed that half of the poultry were infected by H5N1.
The latest suspected bird flu case is a 61-year-old resident of Cimangke
village who is being treated at Hasan Sadikin General Hospital in the West
Java capital of Bandung.
It seems many people hide their poultry when government officials come to
their houses, despite officials explaining to village and community leaders
the importance of the cull. People are now being offered some compensation
for every bird culled and in future the police will accompany inspectors on
their rounds.
The Cikelet region of Indonesia`s West Java province is remote and
inaccessible and the population have had no experience with the disease,
and high-risk behaviors occurred during the disposal of carcasses or the
preparation of sick or dead birds for consumption, says the WHO. In order
to contain the virus, Indonesian authorities are testing all those who were
in contact with the bird flu victims and so far all tests have been
returned negative.
The 2400 people in the area have been provided with Tamiflu, and 2500
chickens have been culled.
Authorities in Thailand are using a team of 800 000 health volunteers to
educate the public about avian influenza and how to prevent it. The
education program will continue for 9 days using a door-knock system
throughout 30 provinces which have been affected by bird flu.
As the autumnal migration of wild birds begins, governments such as Turkey
and the Netherlands are warning their citizens that further avian influenza
outbreaks are possible, and that care and diligence should be taken when
dealing with dead birds.
As of yesterday [23 Aug 2006], according to the WHO the total number of
cases across the world since 2003 are as follows:
Azerbaijan 8 cases and 6 deaths,
Cambodia 6 cases and 6 deaths,
China 21 cases and 14 deaths,
Djibouti 1 case,
Egypt 14 cases and 6 deaths,
Indonesia 60 cases and 46 deaths,
Iraq 2 cases and 2 deaths,
Thailand 24 cases and 16 deaths,
Turkey 12 cases and 4 deaths,
Vietnam 94 cases and 42 deaths.
[Total 241 cases and 141 deaths]

On Fri [25 Aug 2006] 3 residents in the Indonesian province of Central
Sulawesi were admitted to hospital for allegedly developing bird flu
symptoms. Two toddlers aged 2 and 1.5 years and a 21-year-old housewife
were treated at the Undata Hospital in the provincial capital of Paludue to
high fever and respiratory problems. They live in Kamonji district where
authorities recently found dozens of chickens killed by avian influenza,
reported the national Antara news agency.
Earlier in the day, health officials in Palu (Central Sulawesi) began to
cull hundreds of chickens to prevent an outbreak, reported evening
newspaper Sinar Harapan. At least 5 residents in Palu have been
hospitalized for developing bird flu symptoms.
