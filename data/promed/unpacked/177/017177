Health authorities in Mozambique declared a polio outbreak in the country. The declaration on Wednesday [18 May 2022] follows the confirmation of a child in the country's north eastern Tete province who was paralyzed by the disease, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

The case in Mozambique is the second imported case of polio in southern Africa this year [2022], following a case discovered in Malawi in mid-February [2022]. It is the first case of wild polio in Mozambique since 1992, although cases linked to a mutated virus from the oral vaccine were detected in 2019.

Sequencing indicates that the case in Mozambique is linked to a strain of polio spreading in Pakistan in 2019, similar to the case reported in Malawi earlier this year [2022].

WHO declared Africa free of the wild poliovirus in August 2020 even though numerous countries across the continent have reported outbreaks linked to the vaccine in recent years. There is no difference between the disease caused by the wild virus or the mutated virus from the vaccine.

"The detection of another case of wild poliovirus in Africa is greatly concerning, even if it's unsurprising given the recent outbreak in Malawi. However, it shows how dangerous this virus is and how quickly it can spread," said Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization's Africa director.

In response to the case in neighbouring Malawi, Mozambique recently carried out 2 mass vaccination campaigns in which 4.2 million children were vaccinated against the disease, said WHO. Disease surveillance is being strengthened in 5 countries: Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Vaccination campaigns in the coming weeks are planned to reach 23 million children aged 5 years and under.

[The identification of a 2nd case of AFP associated with a WPV1 genetically related to a WPV1 known to be circulating in Pakistan in 2019 is of concern. Of note, Tete is near the border with Malawi, supporting a concern that the virus may be circulating in that region of both countries, although the virus identified in Malawi was related to a virus seen in Sindh province, Pakistan, in 2020, whereas the virus in Mozambique is related to a virus circulating in Pakistan (province not yet identified) in 2019. See Poliomyelitis update (04): cVDPV2 (Mozambique, Nigeria, Somalia), WPV1 Malawi 20220218.8701529 and Poliomyelitis update (08): Malawi WPV1, WHO 20220305.8701806 for details on the 1st case identified in Malawi in February 2022.

The history of a cVDPV outbreak in Mozambique served as a warning that there were pockets of susceptible people in the country.
