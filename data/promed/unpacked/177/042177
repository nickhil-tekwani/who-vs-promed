Update from Sri Lankan media - myocarditis
------------------------------------------
The following appeared in the Sri Lankan newspaper, "The Island," today [23
Feb 2005]. Does anyone have any other information on this outbreak, which
appears to have affected several hospital staff as well? The last newspaper
report on 10 Feb 2005 [see Undiagnosed cardiomyopathy - Sri Lanka: RFI
20050210.0449] stated there were about 70 cases. This report states there
are now over 170 cases.
"Heart disease still baffling researchers: Health research authorities, who
conducted intensive studies in an attempt to trace the cause of the heart
ailment known as myocarditis, which is rapidly spreading in and around the
Badulla district, have come up against a blank wall, health sources said
yesterday [22 Feb 2005].
"Over 170 cases of the heart ailment had been reported, and among them were
the medical staff members and 3 doctors who had treated the patients
infected with the disease," a doctor attached to Badulla General Hospital
told The Island yesterday [22 Feb 2005].
Blood samples of the patients were sent to the Medical Research Institute
(MRI) 3 weeks ago, but they have not been able to identify the cause, he
said, adding that the MRI has once said it was dengue fever only after
testing 15 blood samples. However, cardiologists concluded that it is not
dengue, but it could be myocarditis, which starts with a viral flu-like
fever and will cause an inflammation of the heart, he said.
Chief epidemiologist of the Health Ministry Dr Nihal Abeysinghe said the
blood specimens, which were collected by epidemiologists, were given to
both the MRI and private medical laboratories, yet none could ascertain the
cause of the disease. Another group of medical experts, including
epidemiologists and virologists, is scheduled to leave Colombo for Badulla
today [23 Feb 2005] to continue the investigations, Dr Abeysinghe said.
Consultant cardiologist of Badulla General Hospital Dr Anindu Pathirana
said that the situation is turning out to be increasingly severe day by day.
"Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscles, which will cause
heart failure. Generally, viral or bacterial infection can cause
myocarditis, but the cases reported to us are different. Cases have been
reported from the Badulla, Hali- Ela, Diyathalawa, and Moneragala areas,"
Dr Pathirana said.
Meanwhile, the Health Ministry sources last evening [22 Feb 2005] said that
6 patients in serious condition were transferred to the Cardiology Unit of
the Colombo National Hospital. Sources said that action has been taken to
establish a special ward to separate those patients from others. The World
Health Organization has agreed to provide the Health Ministry with
essential equipment and medicine to combat the disease, ministry sources added.

[As Dr MacIntyre points out, in our 1st posting (see Undiagnosed
cardiomyopathy - Sri Lanka: RFI 20050210.0449), there was a mention of 70
cases associated with this outbreak. At that time, it was described as a
febrile illness with respiratory difficulties, chest pain, dizziness, and
palpitations in some cases. It was unclear whether the respiratory symptoms
are primary pulmonary or secondary to cardiac dysfunction. At that time, we
speculated that myocarditis was a possible etiology for the illness. In the
above newswire, the disease process is not described, other than to refer
to it as possibly "myocarditis." While dengue fever can be associated with
myocarditis-like symptoms (1-3), these have primarily been case reports and
not epidemic/outbreak reports as presently being reported as above in the
Sri Lanka press.
Viral myocarditis has been associated with enterovirus infections
(references 4,7-9). In most of these reports, there are clusters of
myocarditis-like symptoms, mostly in children, but not reports of large
scale outbreaks as described in the above newswire. (In the outbreak in
Malaysia, reference 9, there were 24 cases of left ventricular dysfunction
documented by echocardiogram, whereas, in the outbreak in Taiwan, reference
7, there were 3 cases of myocarditis reported out of the 96 severe cases of
hand, foot and mouth disease). In addition, a cluster of myocarditis-like
symptoms (5 cases) following influenza A illness has been reported
(reference 5).
We do not have information on the age distribution of the cases in Sri
Lanka. There is a suggestion that all age groups may be involved, as there
is a mention of 3 doctors and possibly other medical staff members as well.
More information on the epidemiology of this outbreak, including the case
definition (clinical presentation of cases), would be appreciated. If all
170 cases referred to in the above newswire have myocarditis, this would be
one of the largest outbreaks of myocarditis ever reported.
