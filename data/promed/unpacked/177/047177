Washington state man arrested after deadly ricin found in his
apartment
------------------------------------------
A 37-year-old man is in FBI custody for allegedly possessing the
deadly toxin ricin. The man was arrested at his apartment Friday
and charged with one count of possession of a biological agent or
toxin.
"It is enough that it could cause concern that it could harm
someone; could kill someone," FBI spokeswoman Roberta
Burroughs said.
The man was held pending a hearing Thursday in U.S. District
Court. He is described in court documents as having autism, a
developmental disorder featuring a spectrum of symptoms including
impairments in communication and repetitive behaviors such as
finger-tapping or head-banging.
Federal criminal justice sources told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer
that they do not believe the man had political motivations for making
the ricin and had no plans to use it.
Agents believe the man was making the ricin in his apartment on a
relative's property but won't say how much was found.
The criminal investigation of the man began in November [2003]
when an employee of the Sheffield Seed Company in Locke, New
York, warned the FBI in New York that this man had ordered 2.25
kilograms of castor seeds [beans], a key ingredient in making ricin.
Because the company considered the order unusual, it alerted the
FBI. In December 2003, the seeds were mailed to this particular
individual.
Ricin can be fatal if ingested, inhaled, or injected. There is no
antidote. It is relatively easy to make. Unlike anthrax spores, ricin
requires little scientific training to engineer and is not nearly as
dangerous to handle.
In Washington DC, ricin was found 2 Feb 2004 on a mail-opening
machine in the office suite of Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist [see
ref. below]. The discovery led to a shutdown of 3 Senate office
buildings for several days, and about 2 dozen staffers and Capitol
police officers underwent decontamination.
