Outbreak of Influenza A Infection- Alaska and the Yukon Territory, July 1998
Since July 26th, CDC and Health Canada, in cooperation with local public
health authorities, have been investigating reports of febrile respiratory
illness and associated pneumonia occurring this summer among persons
traveling on land and sea, both independently and on tour packages, in
Alaska and the Yukon Territory. Commonly reported symptoms include fever
and cough, and laboratory evidence suggests that influenza A infection may
be a cause of many of the illnesses. Summertime outbreaks of Influenza A
have previously been reported among tourists in the United States and
Canada (1-2). No evidence suggests increased respiratory illness activity
among residents of these areas.
>From June 5, 1998 through August 4, 1998, 419 cases of acute respiratory
infection (ARI) including 20 cases of pneumonia occurring in June and July
have been reported to the investigation team in Anchorage. No deaths have
been reported. The median age of persons with ARI is 63 years (range: 3
years to 88 years); the median age of persons with pneumonia is 74 years
(range: 61 years to 88 years). Many cases have occurred in clusters,
particularly among smaller groups of 40-50 passengers sharing common
transportation and accommodation packages on overland tours between
Anchorage and Skagway or Anchorage and Seward in June and July. Affected
passengers have traveled on several different tours from different
companies. Information from case reports suggests that after touring
inland, ill persons are boarding cruise ships, possibly resulting in
further spread. In some instances, travelers are becoming ill and seeking
medical attention for their respiratory illnesses only after returning home.
During June- September, approximately 70,000 overland tour and cruise ship
passengers visit Alaska and the Yukon Territory each week. Most do not
experience febrile respiratory illness. No special prevention measures are
recommended at this time for travelers in good health.
Systematic surveillance for febrile respiratory illness and pneumonia is
currently being assembled by CDC, Health Canada and other public health
officials in the region to better define the scope of the outbreak.
Health-care providers seeing patients with febrile respiratory illness
and/or pneumonia should obtain a travel history and consider influenza A in
the differential diagnosis for those with recent travel to Alaska or the
Yukon Territory. Additional cases should be reported to CDC's Special
Investigation Team, telephone 907-729-3431 or fax 907-729-3429, e-mail
SITEAM@cdc.gov.
