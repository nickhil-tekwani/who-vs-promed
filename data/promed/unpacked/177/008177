A mystery disease, possibly caused by pollution, is killing tens of
thousands of flamingos on Lake Bogoria in the Kenyan Rift Valley.
Conservationists are pointing the finger at human pollution as the cause of
the disease, which has killed up to 50 000 birds on the lake, the biggest
concentration of flamingos in the world, since July.
And some say the disease could call into question the future of the lesser
flamingo, the most common type of the species.
Tests done on some of the corpses littering the shores of the lake have
shown alarming results, according to Gideon Motelin, who specializes in
flamingo studies at Kenya's Egerton University.
"In every single bird we collected and analyzed, the tissues were found
having nine or ten heavy metals," he told Reuters.
"It is not normal to find arsenic, lead, mercury, chromium and copper in
the livers and kidneys of these birds." Traces of pesticide have been found
in the body tissue of the dead birds and conservationists believe the
source of the pollution is the farms near Lake Nakuru, about 60 miles south
of Bogoria, which the flamingos abandoned 2 years ago.
"There are large-scale farms there and it's one of the most productive
areas in the country," said Jackson Rayini of the Worldwide Fund for Nature
(WWF). "It's clearly having an impact."
Although there were outbreaks of disease in both 1993 and 1995, each lasted
for just a month. The latest spate of deaths began in July, 1999.
"If it continues like this we may lose quite a keystone species," Rayini
said. "It is extremely worrying."
Eighty percent of the world's flamingo population live on the eastern Rift
Valley lakes, with the vast majority living on the 30 square kilometer
Bogoria -- the only real haven left for the bird since Nakuru became
virtually uninhabitable.
But that haven is also a prison, say the conservationists.
Bogoria used to be a brief stop-over location for the flamingos but with
nowhere else to go they have made the lake their home -- and there is just
not enough food to go around, placing huge pressure both on the birds and
on the lake.
