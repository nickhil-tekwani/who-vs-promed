[1] Egypt - vaccination efficacy questioned

Egypt has detected bird flu in chickens and ducks from reportedly
vaccinated flocks. [This is] a sign that inoculation procedures in
the most populous Arab country may be lacking, an animal health
official said on Tuesday [13 Mar 2007].
The official, who closely follows bird flu in Egypt, said chickens
and ducks from vaccinated household flocks and in poultry farms had
tested positive for the H5N1 bird flu virus this year [2007] in 12
locations, and 8 of the infections were detected this month [March 2007].
"We have outbreaks in vaccinated chickens in many places," the
official told Reuters, asking not to be named because he was not
authorised to speak to the press. "This puts a question mark on
vaccination procedures ... It is dangerous." He said all but one of
the vaccinated flocks where infections occurred, were in the hard-hit
Nile Delta, where most of the country's 24 human cases have been concentrated.
Egypt has the largest number of human cases outside of Asia. Since
the virus first surfaced in Egyptian poultry a year ago [2006], 13
Egyptians have died of the disease, and all but 2 human infections
have been attributed to contact with sick or dead household birds.
Egyptian authorities have said they had virtually eliminated the
disease from poultry farms and hatcheries, where birds are routinely
vaccinated.
An agriculture ministry avian specialist, Saber Abdel Aziz Galal,
confirmed that bird flu had been detected in 2 Nile Delta flocks that
were reportedly vaccinated, but said [the cases] had occurred in
January [2007]. He was unaware of other cases. Ahmed Chikhaoui, the
Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) representative in Cairo, said
he was unaware of detected cases in vaccinated flocks.
Officials said that the problem was likely due to improper
vaccination procedures, and it was possible that the farms where
infections occurred had not followed health ministry
guidelines. "The immunisations did not occur under veterinary
supervision," Galal said, adding that farms may have also brought in
flocks without first consulting proper authorities.
"Last year [2006] there were around 890 farms affected. This year
[2007] it's 2. So naturally there's a big difference," he said. "The
whole problem now is with household poultry."
The animal health official said some farms might be vaccinating
chicks at over 5 days old, which could reduce the efficacy of the
vaccine. He said inoculations should be done when the chicks are a day old.

[According to an FAO update of July 2006, between 50 and 60 million
combined doses of H5N1 and H5N2 inactivated vaccines had been
imported into Egypt up to the said date [30 May 2006]; while large
commercial farms were meant to cover the cost for the vaccines,
reportedly village poultry were vaccinated free of charge (see
ProMED-mail postings Avian influenza (129) - Egypt 20060604.1555,
and Avian influenza (147) - Africa: FAO Update 20060704.1837).
Complementary data, including the current vaccination protocols and
policy, will be helpful for the evaluation of Egypt's situation and
alleged problems.
A list of commercial avian-influenza vaccines, produced in 8
countries (China, France, Netherlands, Pakistan, Mexico, USA, Italy,
and Germany) is available at the FAO website
<http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/vaccine_producers.htm>
Avian influenza vaccines and the recommended vaccination protocols
will be among the issues to be discussed during next week's [20-22
Mar 2007] OIE, FAO, IZSVe (Tri-Veneto Region Experimental Animal
Health Care Institute) scientific conference "Vaccination: a tool for
the control of avian influenza," to be held in Verona, Italy.- Mod.AS]

When the 1st case of avian flu [virus strain H5N1] was reported in
Nigeria [in] February 2006, government and the general public went
into a frenzy of expositions, activities, and reassurances that the
threat was isolated and containable. The result was that, after a
few weeks of slap-stick humour and abstentions, Nigerians had gone
back to their bird-rearing and eating habits without qualms,
believing the reassurances but not taking up the actual measures that
could keep the flu at bay for good.
Now, almost a year later to the day, Nigerians are hearing that the
virus carrying the bird flu has spread to 19 (some say 17 or 15)
states of the federation. The precursor of that bad news of course
was the death of an unnamed 22-year-old girl in Lagos State reported
by the Information and National Orientation Minister, Mr. Frank Nweke
Jr., on 17 Jan 2007.
Part of what came out of the death report was a clinical misdiagnosis
of the victim by the hospitals where she had been admitted.
When it first appeared in Nigeria, only a few farms in the Northern
region -- where seasonal migration of birds from Europe, the
Mediterranean, and Middle East has been a fact of nature -- had been
officially listed as harbouring poultry infected by bird flu. Lagos
State was one of the southern examples.
As of then, the government's announced response was swift and
decisive. Farms identified as infected by the flu were ordered to
cull the birds. Collaboration was sought from foreign virology
experts and world health bodies to proffer technical assistance and
experts to study and check on the flu's proliferation. The World
Health Organization (WHO) and the European Union (EU) offered their help.
To ease the economic loss and burden on affected farmers, the
government offered to compensate them to the tune of N250 [USD 1.96]
per bird. And with a sigh of relief, everyone relaxed.
Until January [2007] when the alarming news surfaced that rather than
being on the decline and extinction, the avian flu had actually been
spreading its deadly tentacles across the federation in the north and
the south.
Apart from Lagos, cases of infected birds have been reported in Edo,
Ebonyi, and in other southern states. [see map at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/nigeria_pol93.jpg>. - Mod.TG]
This development points to one or 2 adverse conclusions that raise a
number of questions about the nation's preparedness and willingness
to tackle disasters of epidemic proportions.
For one thing, the rapid spread of the virus across the country
without detection was a result of lack of proper surveillance and
willingness of farmers to report signs of infection to the
appropriate authorities. This reluctance, it transpired, was a result
of the government's failure to meet its pledge of minimal
compensation to farmers. And though the government has revised the
figure upwards to N1000 [USD 7.83] per bird, there could still be
lingering reluctance of farmers to report cases of the flu on the
suspicion that the government might not really pay the promised compensation.
Another bitter conclusion from the spread of this scourge has been
that not enough experts are available in the country with adequate
diagnostic tools. The dead girl was reportedly misdiagnosed by 2
fairly large hospitals in Lagos. Even though the government
eventually attributed her death to bird flu, confirmation had to be
obtained from WHO and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the
United States.
One more alarming conclusion from the spread [of the disease] is the
fact that Nigerians have become carefree about a disease that when it
attacks the human population could be disastrous, since known cures
are not clear and too expensive for the average citizen.
With a poultry population of about 140 million, 60 percent of which
is kept by backyard farmers, the risk of contact with the human
population is indeed high. And given the poor state of hygiene of
Nigeria's large, urban population, the porous movement of livestock
across states and borders, an epidemic could be catastrophic.
Therefore, the government should be more pro-active in its efforts to
contain the spread of the avian flu. It should begin by assuring
farmers that they will suffer minimal or no financial loss by
reporting signs of infection promptly.
As a public health issue, provisions must be made for those humans
who contract the flu, whose pathology mimics other known diseases.
Nigerians must also be made better aware of how they can contract
avian flu and of preventive measures. Efforts should also be made to
ensure that poultry farms are [not] situated close to residential
areas where human contact is heightened. Contaminated farms must be
thoroughly certified decontaminated before farmers are permitted to restock.
Poultry forms a relatively cheap source of food protein to millions
of Nigerians.

Market prices for corn in the Jiangsu area are stable to slightly
rising. A large local feed producer says that after the Spring
Festival, there are rumors of avian influenza outbreak[s] in this
area with high death rates for poultry. Breeders are panic-stricken
and do not dare casually stock up. Breeding demand has fallen,
dragging down feed demand. But because incoming market volumes [corn
feed supply] are low, prices quoted by traders rose. Actual
purchasing requirements are comparatively weak.
