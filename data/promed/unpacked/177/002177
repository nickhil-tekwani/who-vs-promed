The _Culicoides_ vector of bluetongue disease in Limburg, the Netherlands
-----------------------------------------------
We would like to add to the observations made on 16 Oct 2006 in
ProMED-mail [archived 20061016.2978] on _C. (Avaritia) dewulfi_ being
a possible new vector of BT disease in Europe.
Following upon the outbreak of bluetongue (BT) in the Netherlands,
the Food and Product Safety Authority (VWA, Netherlands) and the
Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale "G. Caporale" (IZS, OIE Ref Lab
for Bluetongue, National Reference Centre for Exotic Diseases,
Teramo, Italy) jointly initiated an entomological study to:
1. obtain "snapshot" maps of the _Culicoides_ fauna of The
Netherlands by extensive light trapping, and
2. to attempt the isolation of BT virus (BTV) from pools of
_Culicoides_ in the infected zone of the Dutch province Limburg.
The study was conducted according to methods used in Italy (Ref 1).
Between 14 and 24 Sep 2006, a BTV-infected dairy was intensively
sampled at Gulpen [map at
<http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?lat=50.8023&lon=5.9002&scale=100000&icon=x>]
for _Culicoides_ using Onderstepoort-type blacklight traps. These
were operated both inside and outside cattle sheds on a farm where 24
out of 96 bovines had seroconverted to BTV in the previous week or 2.
In 35 light trap collections, more than 12 000 _Culicoides_ were
captured belonging to 15 species. All the _Culicoides_ were
age-graded as either nulliparous, parous, gravid or freshly bloodfed;
the 2nd and 3rd of these 4 categories were selected for virus
detection studies as they contain the older females in the population
and so are the ones most likely to harbor BTV. The catches were
dominated by 2 species of the _Obsoletus_ Complex (68 percent) namely
_C. obsoletus sensu stricto_ and _C. scoticus_. (These were
identified on the basis of numerous males in the collections, with
males of the former taxon outnumbering those of the latter by about
7:1; however, it cannot be concluded that the female ratios were the
same). It is well established that the _Obsoletus_ Complex is
involved in the transmission of BT, especially in the Mediterranean
Basin where various serotypes of the virus have been isolated from it
on multiple occasions (Refs. 2, 3, 4). For this reason, and because a
high number of older parous and gravid females could be captured
nightly at Gulpen, the Obsoletus Complex remained our prime vector
suspect in the outbreak.
We were eventually able to harvest (over 11 consecutive nights) a
total of 2500 parous/gravid individuals (25 pools of 100 individuals
each) of obsoletus/scoticus. (After being homogenized, half the pool
was to be tested by PCR and the other half retained for virus
isolation.) The 2nd-most abundant species was _C. dewulfi_ (more than
17 percent). Like the _Obsoletus_ Complex, it had a high parity rate
(about 40 percent); a total of 590 individuals were harvested making
12 pools. The 3rd-most abundant taxon was the _Pulicaris_ Complex
(less than 13 percent) represented by 4 species: _C. pulicaris sensu
stricto_, _C. lupicaris_, _C. punctatus_ and _C. newsteadi sensu_
Delecolle (1985) (Ref 5). However, the _Pulicaris_ Complex had a very
low parity rate (about 12 percent); thus only one pool of 96
specimens of pulicaris/lupicaris and one pool of 20 punctatus were
obtained for PCR. The final pool comprised 36 specimens of _C.
chiopterus_ (which was uncommon, making up a mere 0.4 percent of all
the _Culicoides_ captured). All 40 pools were submitted to the CIDC,
Lelystad, where, on 4 Oct 2006, one was reported PCR positive to BTV.
This was a pool of _C. dewulfi_. This species had never before been
incriminated in the transmission of BT disease in Europe. The result
is of some interest:
1. _C. dewulfi_ is known to breed in "...cow dung lying naturally in
the field" (Ref 6). This dependence on bovid dung means that the
distribution of _C. dewulfi_ will be determined almost totally by
that of cattle. This implies that _C. dewulfi_ might be found
throughout the Netherlands and the rest of Europe where cattle are husbanded;
2. This cattle-_Culicoides_ association occurs elsewhere in the "BT
world," e.g. in southeast Asia (and Australia) and in Africa, where
the respective vectors _C. brevitarsis_ and _C. bolitinos_ breed also
exclusively in cattle (and buffalo) dung;
3. Although _C. dewulfi_ has been reported from across the
Palaearctic region, very little is known about its
population dynamics and seasonality. Studies on its life history are
thus an urgent need for the future. _C. dewulfi_ is known to breed
also in horse dung (Ref 7) and has been shown to bite horses avidly
in Ireland (Ref 8); this close association with equids raises the
vectorial capacity of _C. dewulfi_ for transmitting also equine
orbiviral diseases such as African horse sickness (AHS);
4. As a taxonomic entity, the identification of _C. dewulfi_ is
problematic. Some researchers persist in lumping it in the
_Obsoletus_ Complex (or _C. obsoletus_ group). However, recent
molecular (Ref 9) and morphological studies (Ref 10) conducted in
Italy clearly show it to be: (a) a monophyletic taxon within the
subgenus _Avaritia_, and (b) only distantly related to the 6 or more
species that comprise the _Obsoletus_ Complex sensu stricto;
5. Similarly, as an entity in the field, most researchers in virus
isolation or vector competency studies are not able to confidently
distinguish _C. dewulfi_ from other sympatrically captured species of
the subgenus _Avaritia_ i.e. _C. obsoletus_ and _C. chiopterus_. This
failure might explain the significant BTV oral susceptibility
differences measured recently amongst English populations of _C.
obsoletus_ (Ref 11). Accurate identification -- i.e. a sound taxonomy
-- is fundamental in such studies and exposes the lack of taxonomic
expertise currently available in Europe (as was so clearly
articulated by the Vector Working Group during the 3rd International
Symposium on Bluetongue in Taormina, Sicily, 2003);
6. The implication of _C. dewulfi_ as a vector of BTV in central
Europe should not be interpreted to exclude other _Culicoides_ from
involvement in the outbreak. It would be prudent to consider the
_Obsoletus_ Complex as having played also a vectorial role, as it was
consistently abundant (at least at Gulpen) and had a parity rate
matching that of _C. dewulfi_.
We did not capture a single specimen of _C. imicola_ (the principal
vector of BT in the Mediterranean Basin) in the Gulpen area; nor was
it found in a further 104 light trap collections made across the
Netherlands during September 2006. Although _C. imicola_ appears not
to have established itself in central Europe, this does not exclude
the remote possibility of BTV-8 having been brought into the region
by a single infected individual of _C. imicola_ (on an aeroplane or otherwise).
Although additional studies are required to more conclusively
implicate _C. dewulfi_ as a vector of BTV, it now seems abundantly
clear that _Culicoides_ endemic to central Europe are quite capable
of replicating and transmitting the virus and that they can do so
without the help of _C. imicola_. This vectorial capacity of central
European _Culicoides_ will likely increase under the influence of a
globally warming climate. In this context, it is pertinent to note
that the 3 most-abundant species of _Culicoides_ captured at Gulpen
have all been implicated -- somewhere in Europe -- in the transmission of BTV.
Central Europe must therefore consider itself vulnerable to a variety
of _Culicoides_-borne orbiviral diseases of livestock, which may be
introduced adventitiously along any one of its numerous trade routes.
This includes the truly devastating disease of African horse
sickness, as was so rightly indicated in ProMED-mail post
20061016.2978 of 16 Oct 2006. _C. dewulfi_ (along with _C.
obsoletus_) also feeds avidly on horses (Townley et al 1984).

[This firsthand, authoritative and scientifically-sound information
is very much appreciated. Though, as indicated, further research is
required, the results obtained might be regarded as significant
progress towards solving the enigma of bluetongue's recent spread
into and within northwest Europe. Readers are referred to the
authors' commentary as to the potential further spread of bluetongue
and the possible introduction and spread of other orbiviruses (e.g.
various BT serotypes, Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease (EHD), African
horse sickness (AHS)) within the palearctic region. Should these
preliminary findings be definitely established, other vector-borne
diseases currently endemic in southern regions in Africa and Asia,
such as Akabane disease and Bovine Ephemeral fever, will have to be
also seriously considered as candidate intruders.
It would be interesting to note whether BTV isolation from arthropods
has been attempted in one or more of the infected countries bordering
the Netherlands; if so, that information would be appreciated. - Mod.AS]

Bluetongue in Northern Europe: OIE Reference Laboratory makes a
breakthrough in identifying the vector causing the disease
-----------------------------------------------
The OIE Reference Laboratory in Teramo, Italy established that an
insect adapted to European climate acted as the vector responsible
for the recent bluetongue outbreaks in Northern Europe. The vector, a
biting midge of the _Culicoides_ genus, was identified as _Culicoides
dewulfi_. Previously, it was thought the biting midge responsible for
the current spread of the disease might be _Culicoides imicola_,
which is commonly found in Africa.
"It is an important new epidemiological event, because previously,
all bluetongue outbreaks were linked to an African vector. This
suggests the disease could now stay in all of the region, with the
risk of more cases occurring in spring when the vector activity is
very high," Dr. Bernard Vallat, Director General of the World
Organization for Animal Health said during a meeting of an OIE expert
group on the disease.
Following unusual outbreaks in Belgium, The Netherlands and France,
the OIE called for the best world veterinary experts on bluetongue to
advise the OIE and Member Countries on adjusting existing standards
and guidelines for the containment and control of the disease while
maintaining a scientific basis for the continuation of trade in live
animals. Gathered at the OIE headquarters in Paris on Fri 20 Oct
2006, the scientists, including Dr. Rudy Meiswinkel, responsible for
the finding, disclosed that a European vector was incriminated for
the 1st time in the spread of bluetongue in the region.
They further established that due to the adaptability of this
specific biting midge to European weather circumstances, the virus
now has the potential to expand geographically within Europe, which
could require that countries trading in animals have a re-look at
control and surveillance of the disease.
Although the OIE has already initiated the process to update the
existing international standards for the control of bluetongue, the
immediate need is to apply scientifically based methods to contain
the disease while ensuring the continuation of trade. Surveillance
activities for the disease must be intensified, even in those areas
not previously regarded as being threatened by the disease, and the
application of vaccination programs that would not inhibit trade
between countries must be implemented.
Commenting on the experts' recommendations, Dr. Vallat also urged
vaccine manufacturers to proceed in the development of inactivated
and other more technologically advanced vaccines that would have the
potential not only to effectively control the disease but also
facilitate trade, thanks to the detection of virus circulation in live animals.
During the meeting, support was expressed for the development by the
OIE of a worldwide surveillance network for increased knowledge of
and transparency on the disease. These initiatives will contribute to
improving animal health control worldwide and protecting countries
from unjustified trade barriers.
The global distribution of the disease, comprising the endemic areas
of bluetongue, has traditionally been accepted to be between the
latitudes of approximately 50 N and 35 S. There is now enough
scientific evidence to accept its spread further north, between 53 N and 35 S.
Bluetongue is an insect-borne viral disease to which all species of
ruminants are susceptible. The disease poses no danger to human health.
It occurs mostly during periods of high temperature and rainfall and
usually disappears with the 1st frost or severe cold weather, when
midges stop their activity.
Globalization, the change in weather patterns and the increase in
speed and volume of international transport as well as passenger
travel are known factors that could favor the spread of pathogens and
the emergence of disease. [This applies to air travel of captive and
domestic animals also. - Mod.JW]
Although the source of infection of this outbreak is still under
investigation, the OIE highlights the importance of having effective
veterinary services. The ability to detect early and respond rapidly
to an unexpected event is dependent on the effectiveness of a
national surveillance system and transparency in reporting.
Veterinary services are guarantors of animal health and animal welfare.
