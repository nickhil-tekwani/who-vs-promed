This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

Outbreak location 1: Vereda Cañaverales, Morales, Cauca
Started: 18 Apr 2022
Epidemiological unit: Backyard
Animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Birds / 30 / 19 / 1 / 29 / 0 / 0
Affected population: The affected population included backyard poultry living with wild birds. Respiratory clinical signs were reported. The farm implements poor biosecurity measures.

Outbreak location 2: Vereda Sandovales, Suarez, Cauca
Started: 10 Apr 2022
Epidemiological unit: Backyard
Animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Birds / 29 / 27 / 25 / 4 / 0 / 0
Affected population: The affected population included backyard poultry. Respiratory clinical signs were reported. The farm implements poor biosecurity measures.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: Following outbreak detection, epidemiological surveillance and control activities were implemented. An outbreak zone, a zone around the outbreak and a surveillance zone were established. In the outbreak zone and the zone around the outbreak, the whole poultry population was identified, and samples were taken for active surveillance in 100% of the farms. In the surveillance zone, individual clinical inspection activities and attention to suspicions were carried out in order to assess the disease spread. The likely origin of the infection is currently under study. As a control measure, the affected farms and the farms in the department were quarantined to prevent movement of animals and products to other territories. Affected animals and in-contact animals in the farms where the disease was detected were killed. Emergency vaccination has started in all zones.

Control measures at event level
Domestic control measures applied: Surveillance outside the restricted zone, surveillance within the restricted zone, traceability, screening, movement control, selective killing and disposal, disinfection, quarantine
Domestic control measures to be applied: Stamping out

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Outbreaks / Test / Test date / Result
National Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (national laboratory) / Birds / Nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (nested RT-PCR) / 30 Apr 2022 / Positive

[In April 2021, Colombia self-declared itself a country free from Newcastle disease in poultry. The complete self-declaration document can be accessed at https://www.oie.int/app/uploads/2021/07/2021-03-colombia-nd-eng.pdf.

This document mentions: "The last outbreak of the disease was detected by the ICA on 20 Sep 2019 following a notification (complaint) of a clinical picture compatible with the disease in a backyard farm with a population of 200 fattening birds without biosecurity. The following activities were carried out: quarantine of the premises with restriction of entry or exit of new birds for marketing or any other purpose during the following 90 days, no stamping out or vaccination of birds was carried out since all the animals in the backyard premises died of the disease, the disposal of carcasses in compost was supervised as well as the cleaning and disinfection of the premises (including facilities, equipment and utensils used for handling the birds), epidemiological surveillance and peri-focal vaccination within a radius of 5 km, epidemiological monitoring and tracing of the origin of the birds in backyard premises in the municipality of Malambo, Department of Atlántico, in which a normal health situation was found with healthy birds and absence of clinical signs compatible with the disease. Therefore, the hypothesis of origin was handled as an infection of the birds in the affected premises (viral recirculation) due to inadequate biosecurity measures, cleaning and disinfection of facilities, equipment and utensils in the premises. Historically, the Department of Atlántico has had outbreaks of the disease in recent years in municipalities such as Polonuevo affecting a population of 220 poultry with a morbidity of 9%, Baranoa involving 65 poultry with a morbidity of 49%, and finally Galapa in a backyard flock with 76 birds and a morbidity of 13%."

"According to information from the Livestock Census for the year 2020, the poultry population in the country is distributed in 469 140 farms, of which 463 113 (98.7%) are backyard farms and the remaining 6027 (1.3%) are technified farms. Production on technified farms reached 982 895 tons of eggs and 1 619 784 tons of chicken for the country in the previous year (2020). The total number of animals counted amounted to 201 600 918 birds, an increase of 7.5%, compared to the previous year, of which 95.4% are poultry from technified farms and the remaining 4.6% are backyard poultry. Of the country's total poultry population, 71.6% is concentrated in 5 departments: Santander (24.0%), Cundinamarca (18.2%), Valle del Cauca (16.9%), Cauca (6.7%) and Antioquia (5.8%)."

"Colombia has had active epidemiological surveillance studies specifically for Newcastle disease since 2014."

"The epidemiological surveillance system of the country has the technical capacity to develop passive and active surveillance to ensure the maintenance of the country free from Newcastle disease." - Mod.CRD
