BBC World News tonight, 9 May 2002, reports that several letters
contaminated with anthrax have been detected in recent mail in the Federal
Reserve building in Washington, DC. However, these letters have no other
suspicious characteristics, & it is thought they may have suffered
cross-contamination in a mail sorting location which had not been
sufficiently cleaned following the October 2002 episode. - Mod.JW]

Anthrax Sent Through Mail Gained Potency by the Letter
-----------------------------------------------
Deepening the mystery of the biological attacks that terrified the nation
last fall, federal investigators have discovered that the anthrax sent
through the mail, in general, grew more potent from one letter to the next,
with the spores in the final letter to be opened (the one sent to Senator
Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont) the deadliest of all. The finding has surprised
and worried investigators, who say it poses a new riddle: was the culprit an
amateur making gradual improvements through experimentation, a malevolent
professional intentionally ratcheting up the potency of the germ powder, or
someone else entirely?
With 5 anthrax deaths linked to the contaminated mailings, the FBI inquiry
has consumed millions of hours of interviews, neighborhood sweeps and other
detective work. For example, FBI laboratory analysts matched the serrated
ends of the strips of cellophane tape used to seal the anthrax letters. That
meant that whoever sealed the letters, without leaving any fingerprints,
tore off successive strips of tape from the same roll, officials said.
But investigators acknowledge that they still have no idea who is behind the
tainted letters. So they are increasingly turning to science to unravel the
mystery. Tests being conducted at several private laboratories may reveal
the precise biological signature of the anthrax used in the mailings,
helping to narrow the search for the laboratory from which it came. Analyses
of the anthrax sample and the chemicals used to coat it could yield clues to
the techniques and equipment used to manufacture the germ material.
Investigators previously believed that the anthrax sent to Mr. Leahy, the
Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Tom Daschle,
the Senate majority leader, were identical in strength. Each letter was
mailed from Trenton on 9 Oct 2001. Each had the same photocopied message
inside.
But it turns out that the Leahy anthrax is finer, its spores having a
smaller range of particle sizes, officials familiar with the federal
investigation said. "It could be that the final steps of the processing were
done in steps," a senior government official said. "You take it so far, and
take off a bunch. You go further, and take off another bunch."
Despite the increasing sophistication of the anthrax, investigators say
they still judge that the deadly powder could have been made in any of
thousands of biological laboratories, though getting the right starter
germs would have been difficult.
An aide to Senator Daschle opened the letter on 15 Oct 2001, and officials
quickly warned that its anthrax was of high quality compared with earlier
mailings, to news media offices in New York. The Leahy letter was
impounded, along with all other Congressional mail, and was not discovered
until 16 Nov 2001. Investigators made painstaking safety and forensic
preparations before opening it in early December 2001.
The analysis of the contents of the Leahy letter is proceeding slowly, the
investigators say, because they are learning the science as they go along
and want to make sure that none of the scarce, lightweight, but extremely
valuable evidence is lost, corrupted, or misinterpreted. They are getting
help, they say, from scores of scientists across the nation. "We'll have to
take this into court," the law enforcement official said of the evidence.
"We had to assure ourselves that we had a quality program."
A senior Bush administration official expressed sympathy for the FBI
because the inquiry had grown so scientifically complex and knowledgeable
advisers are so few. "They're having to review a lot of the initial takes
on things," the official said. "There's an evolving picture. The bureau has
gone back to scratch to invent the science."
It is sometimes hard even to do reappraisals. In the Florida case, no
letter or residual powder was ever recovered, leaving many questions about
the anthrax there.
Federal officials said the first wave of well-documented attacks with
mailed anthrax - in letters from Trenton postmarked 18 Sep 2001 to NBC News
and The New York Post - was relatively crude. The powder was heavily
contaminated, they said, with what biologists call vegetative cells -
anthrax bacteria before processing in the laboratory turns them into
hardened spores. Vegetative cells in dry anthrax powder are generally dead
and therefore harmless, experts said. By contrast, the tiny spores live in
a dormant state. Individual ones are light enough to float easily in the
air and, if inhaled, small enough to reach deep into human lungs,
eventually germinating into bacteria and causing the respiratory form of
the disease, which can be fatal. They can also cause the less dangerous
cutaneous form if rubbed into the skin.
In October 2001, alarm bells rang when the Daschle powder was found to be
nearly pure spores. The danger was driven home when nasal swabs came back
positive for 28 people in the Senate Hart building, where the letter was
opened. The FBI in early November 2001 characterized the Daschle powder as
"much more refined, more potent, and more easily dispersed" than the New
York media anthrax. The mailer's letters hinted at the danger. The media
ones warned the openers to take penicillin. But the Daschle letter said
flatly, "You Die Now."
As federal experts investigated the residual Daschle sample, they found the
picture becoming fuzzier. On one hand, the concentration of the anthrax was
extraordinarily high - roughly equal to that made in the abandoned American
germ weapons program, a trillion spores per gram. But federal experts now
say the particles turned out to have a large size range. While single
spores predominated, the experts said, some Daschle clusters ranged up to
40 microns wide - far too big to penetrate human lungs. A micron is
one-millionth of a meter, and a human hair is 75 to 100 microns wide. The
big clusters suggested the powder was far less than weapons grade.
Private experts disagree on just how much less. Ken Alibek, a former Soviet
germ official who is now president of Advanced Biosystems, a consulting
company in Manassas, Va., called the Daschle anthrax mediocre. "It was not
done with a regular industrial process," Dr. Alibek said in an interview.
"Maybe it's homemade." Recipes that antigovernment militia groups circulate
at gun shows might suffice to make the deadly powder, he said.
But William C. Patrick III, a scientist who made germ weapons for the
American military and is now a private consultant on biological defense,
rated the Daschle anthrax as 7 on a scale of 10. "It's relatively high
grade," Mr. Patrick said, "but not weapons grade."
In addition to particle size, federal experts are investigating whether the
anthrax powders have electrostatic charges that affect dispersal and
chemical coatings meant to increase potency and shelf life.
Federal investigators saw the Leahy anthrax as an opportunity to clear up
ambiguities and deepen the analysis. Since no powder had been lost in the
letter's opening, they had more to work with. Still, the amount, typical of
the tainted letters, was remarkably small - just 0.871 grams. A pat of
butter weighs 10 grams.
Last week, government officials said the most recent analyses showed that
the Daschle and Leahy powders were quite different, the latter finer and
more uniform. "You can characterize the Leahy as having a smaller particle
range," one official said.
A biologist aiding in the investigation said the increasing potency of
anthrax in the letters might suggest that the attacker was a thief who
stole several samples. "Maybe he didn't pocket one vial but 2 or 3, if
we're assuming this was an opportunist," this scientist said.
Dr. Alibek raised another possible factor. The FBI, he said, needed to
weigh the possibility that Post Office sorting machinery might have had an
effect. "It could be an additional process of milling," he said, "like a
mortar and pestle." Experts said the Daschle and Leahy letters, starting at
the same place in New Jersey on the same date and ending up at the same
destination in Washington, appear to have taken similar if not identical
postal routes. Dr. Alibek agreed but said the same sorter could apply more
pressure to one letter than another. He added that the overall grade
contrasts were probably caused by "different batches of the product, one
more sophisticated than the other."
Investigators have also been studying the envelopes, officials say, and
have found that the paper had very large pores - up to 50 microns wide.
That is bigger than the largest Daschle anthrax clusters and suggests how
the powder could easily escape individual letters to contaminate the
general mails. "It had to be one of the most porous materials," an official
said of the attack envelopes compared with standard ones. "Whether that was
by chance or design, I have no idea."

Comparative Genome Sequencing for Discovery of Novel Polymorphisms in
_Bacillus anthracis_
---------------------------------------------------------------
Timothy D. Read, et al.
Comparison of the whole-genome sequence of _Bacillus anthracis_ isolated
from a victim of a recent bioterrorist anthrax attack with a reference
reveals 60 new markers that include single nucleotide polymorphisms,
indels, and tandem repeats. Genome comparison detected 4 high-quality SNPs
between the 2 sequenced _B. anthracis_ chromosomes and 7 differences
between different preparations of the reference genome. These markers have
been tested on a collection of anthrax isolates and were found to divide
these samples into distinct families. These results demonstrate that
genome-based analysis of microbial pathogens will provide a powerful new
tool for investigation of infectious disease outbreaks.
[The full script is worth reading carefully. It demonstrates that minor
differences can be perceived in the pX02 sequences. These have the capacity
to rule out certain laboratories as possible sources. - Mod.MHJ]

Pesticide May Kill Anthrax
------------------------------------
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (5 May 2002) -- A common pest-control agent used to kill
termites and fumigate citrus for shipment overseas could also be used to
clean anthrax spores out of buildings, a researcher says. The chemical,
methyl bromide, would be more effective and cheaper than current methods
used for anthrax decontamination of spaces inside buildings, said Rudolf
Scheffrahn, a professor of entomology at the University of Florida's
Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. "Tests indicate the fumigant
used for more than 50 years to control insect pests in buildings, grain
elevators and fresh fruit is a better option than current treatments, such
as chlorine dioxide, for killing anthrax and other bacterial spores,''
Scheffrahn said.
The reason may be that the chemical properties of the 2 gases are
different, he said. Chlorine dioxide begins breaking down as soon as it is
released, while methyl bromide is more stable.
Using anthrax cleanup guidelines developed by the U.S. Army and the
Environmental Protection Agency, Scheffrahn tested methyl bromide in a
vacant mobile home at the school's Fort Lauderdale Research and Education
Center. Instead of using anthrax, he used harmless spores of a related
bacterium, _Bacillus subtilis_, which he said is even more resistant to
chemicals than anthrax. About 80 paper strips, each containing as many as
100 million spores of the anthrax-like surrogate, were placed in walls,
under carpets, inside computers and file cabinets, and in other hidden
places that might harbor spores in an actual anthrax contamination.
"The tests killed the spores and proved that methyl bromide is more
effective than chlorine dioxide gas as a building fumigant for anthrax,''
Scheffrahn said.
Jeff Kempter, senior adviser at EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs in
Arlington, Va., said the results are promising. "It has the potential to be
as effective as the chlorine dioxide,'' he said. Kempter said the use of
methyl bromide would be considered on a case-by-case basis.
Scheffrahn said methyl bromide fumigation would have cost less than
one-fourth the estimated $23 million spent to clean up the anthrax
contamination in the 3000-square-foot Daschle Suite in the Hart Senate
Office Building in Washington. The cleanup estimate was based on an EPA
study.
Scheffrahn also said it could be used to clear up any remaining
contamination at the American Media Inc. office building in Boca Raton,
site of the nation's first fatal anthrax infection in October 2001.
"Another advantage of using methyl bromide fumigant is that it will not
damage equipment, furnishings or sensitive materials,'' he said.
Kempter said the EPA discussed the decontamination options with American
Media at a meeting in March. Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for American
Media Inc., said company officials haven't determined a cleanup method and
is still negotiating with its insurance company to determine how much it
will pay toward a cleanup. "It's not going to be cheap,'' he said.
Scheffrahn said emergency use of methyl bromide fumigant shouldn't be
affected by a looming 2005 phaseout of the gas. It is one of many gases
that deplete the Earth's protective ozone layer, and many uses will be
eliminated after 2005.
