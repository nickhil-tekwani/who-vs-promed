Multistate outbreak of _Salmonella_Mbandaka infections linked to Kellogg's Honey Smacks cereal
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CDC continues to recommend people not eat and retailers not sell any Kellogg's Honey Smacks cereal. It might be contaminated with _Salmonella_ and could make people sick. 27 more ill people from 19 states were added to this outbreak since the last update on 14 Jun 2018, and 2 more states -- Florida and Colorado -- reported ill people.

As of 12 Jul 2018, 100 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Mbandaka have been reported from 33 states.

Total / 100

Illnesses started on dates from 3 Mar 2018-2 Jul 2018. Ill people range in age from less than one year to 95, with a median age of 57. Of ill people, 68 percent are female. Out of 77 people with information available, 30 (39 percent) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Illnesses that occurred after 19 Jun 2018 might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when their illness is reported. This takes an average of 2-4 weeks. Please see the Timeline for Reporting Cases of _Salmonella_ Infection for more details.

Investigation update
----------------
State and local health officials continue to interview ill people and ask questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. 55 (85 percent) of 65 people interviewed reported eating cold cereal. In interviews, 43 people specifically reported eating Kellogg's Honey Smacks cereal. Ill people in this outbreak reported this cereal more often than any other cereals or food items.

Health officials in several states collected Kellogg's Honey Smacks cereal from retail locations and ill people's homes for testing. Laboratory testing identified the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Mbandaka in a sample of unopened Kellogg's Honey Smacks cereal collected from a retail location in California. Laboratory testing also identified the outbreak strain in samples of leftover Kellogg's Honey Smacks cereal collected from the homes of ill people in Montana, New York, and Utah.

The Kellogg Company recalled all Honey Smacks products that were on the market within the cereal's one-year shelf-life. However, Honey Smacks products with earlier dates could also potentially be contaminated. Do not eat Kellogg's Honey Smacks cereal of any size package or with any "best if used by" date.

CDC will provide updates when more information is available.
