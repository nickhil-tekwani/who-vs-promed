The purpose of this Health Advisory is to inform you of a recent and potentially ongoing outbreak of _Campylobacter_ infections that have been associated with consuming raw milk.

_Campylobacter_ infection is reportable by state regulations to the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services' Section of Epidemiology (SOE). Since late January 2013, 4 people with confirmed _ Campylobacter_ infection and at least 1 person with probable infection reported consuming raw (unpasteurized) milk in the few days preceding illness. One infant with close contact to a confirmed case-patient is also suspected of having _Campylobacter_ infection. All 6 reside on the Kenai Peninsula. The _Campylobacter_ isolated from the 4 lab-confirmed cases are a match by molecular techniques (pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE). This strain of _Campylobacter_ has not been previously identified in Alaska.

_Campylobacter_ are bacteria that can cause diarrhea (sometimes bloody), abdominal cramping/pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever within 2 to 5 days after exposure. The illness typically lasts from several days to over a week, with variable severity. Some people, especially young children or individuals with compromised immune systems, can develop severe or even life-threatening illness. Infrequently, _Campylobacter_ infection leads to long-term consequences. Some people develop arthritis, and rarely, some develop a life-threatening disease called Guillain-Barre syndrome that inflames the nerves of the body beginning several weeks after the onset of diarrhea.

Outbreaks of _Campylobacter_ are often associated with consumption of unpasteurized milk -- one such outbreak, traced to a Mat-Su Valley farm, resulted in 18 illnesses in Alaska in 2011.

[In the March 2012 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases (Langer AJ, Ayers T, Grass J, et al: Nonpasteurized dairy products, disease outbreaks, and state laws -- United States, 1993-2006. Emerg Infect Dis 2012; 18(3): 385-91 (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/3/11-1370_article.htm), the authors report on 121 foodborne outbreaks (with 4413 cases of reported illness) caused by contaminated dairy products, and 73 (60 percent) were involved with unpasteurized dairy products. 65 (54 percent) involved cheese, 42 percent made from unpasteurized milk, and 56 involved fluid milk, 82 percent involved unpasteurized milk. In these outbreaks, _Campylobacter_ was responsible for 54 percent of the outbreaks, following by _Salmonella_ spp (22 percent), Enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (13 percent), _Brucella_ spp (4 percent), _Listeria_ (4 percent), and _Shigella_ spp (3 percent).

Clearly, pasteurized milk can also transmit disease, and 48 outbreaks were reported. The source of contamination was reported in only 7 (14 percent), of which at least 4 resulted from post-pasteurization contamination by an infected food handler.

The reader is directed to the article for additional information and discussion. - Mod.LL
