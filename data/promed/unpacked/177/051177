At least 4 people have died after contracting the chikungunya virus -- which is [usually] non-life threatening -- in Tharparkar over the past week [week of Sun 13 Aug 2017], with hundreds others believed to have been diagnosed with the virus this month [August 2017]. According to district health officer (DHO) Dr Shafiqur Rehman Memon, 567 people have been diagnosed with the chikungunya virus in the district in the past 3 weeks. However, locals and doctors claim over 2000 people have been affected by the virus in Tharparkar.

The chief executive officer of the Health and Nutrition Development Society (HANDS) expressed concern over the virus outbreak and attributed the deaths to poor treatment or self-medication.

Hundreds of patients were rushed to the ill-equipped Chhachhro taluka hospital for treatment. The hospital, housing only 20 beds and 3 wards, cannot accept any more patients. The affected are now being transported to hospitals in Umerkot and Mithi.

According to the DHO's statement, most affected villages include Ram Sighani, Udani and Fangario, among others, where medical camps are being set up to treat patients. Although Dr Memon claimed that measures are being taken to prevent the virus from spreading any further, those affected and their families deny that authorities have provided them any health facilities in Chhachhro and other towns.

The DHO said that the increase in the cases of the virus was due to heavy rainfall in the arid region, adding that the situation was "under control", and that various villages have already been fumigated twice to get rid of the virus-carrying mosquitoes. Dr Memon said that Field Emergency Laboratory Testing Programme, in collaboration with the Centre for Disease Control conducted medical tests of patients complaining of severe joint pain -- one of the main symptoms of chikungunya virus. The blood samples of the patients are now being sent to the National Institute of Health in Islamabad.

HANDS chief Dr Shaikh urged authorities and non-profit organizations to send more medical teams to Thar in order to control the alarming increase in the cases of chikungunya virus. He also said that he has directed workers in his organization to spread awareness among locals to prevent the virus from spreading further.

[It seems that the chikungunya outbreaks are spreading to other parts of Sindh province. The public health officials must initiate measures for elimination of the vector and engage the community in these efforts throughout the process. - Mod.UBA
