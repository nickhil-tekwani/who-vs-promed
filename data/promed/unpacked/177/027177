Sore mouth disease is thought to be responsible for illness recently observed among the bighorn sheep population in Zion National Park.

Also known as contagious ecthyma, sore mouth disease is a chickenpox-like virus, typically self-limiting and mild. It is common throughout the world in wild and domestic sheep and goats. Spread from ewes to lambs, it can manifest itself in sores around the mouths of lambs and cause mastitis of the ewes' teats. Lesions typically disappear in 2 to 4 weeks. It has the greatest effect on lambs, who because of sore mouths, refuse to suckle.

Though rarely fatal, park biologists expect to see some mortality. Since the incubation period is 1 to 2 weeks, visitors could possibly see sick animals for many months as the disease moves through the population. Sore mouth disease is not eradicable, but subsequent outbreaks are usually less severe.

There is no cure for sore mouth disease in sheep; only supportive treatment can be given. Treatment in this case is not a viable option due to the number of animals involved and the stress sedation puts on sick animals.

Sore mouth disease is a zoonotic disease, meaning it can spread from infected sheep to humans. People exposed to the virus, especially those with poor immune systems, can develop sores on their hands after touching the saliva or open sores of infected sheep. In humans, the sores are painful but usually resolve on their own without treatment. There have been no reported human cases to date, but the park is reminding visitors not to approach or touch wildlife.

"People should never be approaching wildlife at Zion National Park, so we do not expect to have any issues with visitors contracting this disease from the bighorn sheep," Park Superintendent Jock Whitworth said. "It is hard to watch a disease spread through a population, but we need to let nature take its course."

[Contagious ecthyma (CE) is caused by a parapox virus known to affect domestic sheep and goats worldwide. It causes pustules followed by scabbing on the muzzle, face, and lips of ruminants. Lesions can also form inside the mouth, on the coronary band above the hooves, on the udder, or on the genitalia.

CE was first documented in Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep (_Ovis canadensis canadensis_) in North America in 1953. Since then, clinical signs of CE have been documented in many bighorn sheep populations. The virus most likely circulates endemically in these populations and clinical signs surface during a stressing period.
