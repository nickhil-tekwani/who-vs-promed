Killer rabbit disease strikes
-----------------------------
Rabbit owners are being urged to vaccinate their pets after the outbreak of
a killer disease in the county, including at least one case in South
Woodham Ferrers.
Up to 7 rabbits are thought to have been killed by Viral Hemorrhagic
Disease (VHD) in the South Woodham Ferrers and Wickham Bishops areas. The
highly-infectious disease, which causes bleeding from the nose and rear
end, often lays undiscovered until the rabbit is dead. Even then, only a
post mortem will reveal the virus, something many owners are reluctant to
pay for.
Vet Aisling Sumner, from South Woodham's Best Friends Veterinary Centre,
said: "There has been a reported case of VHD in South Woodham Ferrers. This
is a deadly disease that can affect any rabbit over 6 weeks old. It is a
very virulent virus that attacks the liver and causes severe bleeding. Most
animals infected die very quickly with no warning signs or illness. This
virus survives in the environment for a long time and can be spread easily
on clothing and footwear and by birds and insects. There is no effective
treatment, and the only way to protect your rabbit is to vaccinate." She
added: "We have not had any more confirmed cases, but people have called to
say they've found their rabbits dead, which could be as a result of VHD,
and this is why we're trying to make people aware."
Paul Hopkins, a Colchester-based district advisor for the British Rabbit
Council, said he had never known of any cases of VHD in the county before.
"How it came to Essex we don't know," he said. He urged anyone with a
known case to contact him on 01206 511016 or 07951 841855.
The Rabbit Welfare Association's Anne Mitchell said the charity's Easter
campaign will concentrate on VHD vaccination. "An awful lot of the public
don't know about VHD and are not aware it can be carried on shoes, clothes
and hair. In 48 hours, it can kill a rabbit; it's highly dangerous," she
said. South Woodham's Marsh Farm said it was conferring with its own vets
about its rabbits.
Viral Hemorrhagic Disease (VHD) 1st appeared in the UK in 1992 and was a
notifiable disease until 1996. The disease can be spread by wild rabbits
and their droppings, vermin, birds and insects. It can also be carried on
the wind. The virus can survive for many months in an environment.
Rabbits should be given a VHD booster vaccine every year. House rabbits
are less at risk from VHD, but still should be vaccinated. Keeping hutches
and cages very clean reduces the risk of catching the disease. Don't pick
green food from areas where wild rabbits live.
