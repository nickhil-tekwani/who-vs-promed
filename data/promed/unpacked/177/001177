At least 200 cases of cholera have been reported in the Yemeni capital of Sana'a recently, local hospitals confirmed on [Fri 5 May 2017]. A joint statement released by hospitals in Sana'a revealed that 218 people have been affected by cholera, including 3 people who died of this disease.

The medical sources inside the province of Ibb in central Yemen also confirmed to the Arabic language news site "Ababil Net" that the cholera epidemic has struck the region after the discovery of many cases. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) also confirmed the reports last April [2017] about the spread of cholera in Yemen.

[Sana'a was noted to have been affected by cholera in the initial ProMED-mail report (Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (34): Asia (Yemen) 20161025.4583827) of the outbreak in October 2017: "The WHO said it had confirmed 11 cases of cholera in Sana'a and warned that the scarcity of drinkable water has worsened hygienic conditions and fuelled a marked increase in cases of severe diarrhea, in particular among people displaced from their homes in central Yemen." Clearly the outbreak of _V. cholerae_ infection in this war-torn nation is continuing.
