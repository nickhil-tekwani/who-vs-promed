This month [December 2014], staff at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital (VTH) at the Louisiana State University (LSU) School of Veterinary Medicine successfully treated the 1st case of equine coronavirus, an emerging disease of global concern for both the veterinary and equine communities, reported in Louisiana.

In 2013, the New York State Animal Health Diagnostic Center at Cornell University (the central testing center for equine coronavirus) received 144 samples, 38 of which tested positive or were suspect. Positive samples have originated from several states, including New York, Missouri, South Carolina, and Vermont. Outbreaks have also been confirmed in Europe and Japan.

A little less than 30 years ago, equine coronavirus was known as a pathogen (an agent causing disease) of foals and immunocompromised adult horses causing anorexia, lethargy, and diarrhea. But beginning in 2000, isolated cases of coronavirus in previously healthy adults with well functioning immune systems were reported, and in 2011, multiple outbreaks of equine coronavirus began to be reported in the northeastern United States.

The most common signs of equine coronavirus are signs of mild to moderate colic, changes in manure consistency (ranging from soft to liquid), anorexia, and high fever. Though the disease is rarely fatal, complications from dehydration, nutrient loss, and secondary bacterial infections are common and can negatively impact the prognosis. Clinical signs usually last from 1 to 4 days with supportive care. Treatment usually consists of fluids, anti-inflammatory therapy, and antibiotics if there is a high risk of secondary bacterial infection. There are currently no vaccines available against the virus.

This particular virus is only contagious to other horses; related, but distinct, viruses can cause disease in other species, including humans, but the equine coronavirus is species-specific, so it is not contagious to humans. The virus is transmitted through contact with contaminated feces (fecal-oral route), and affected horses can shed the virus for up to 21 days without any obvious signs of illness. Prevention is key; a 3-week minimum quarantine of new horses or recently diagnosed horses is recommended to prevent spread of the disease.

If a horse is infected, maintaining good hygiene and biosecurity after handling sick horses is paramount (e.g. interacting with the sick horses last and wearing gloves and boot covers when handling sick horses). Keep a sick horse's tack, feeding, grooming or stall equipment away from healthy horses, and thoroughly clean all equipment with a detergent followed by a disinfectant such as bleach. Bedding, water, uneaten feed, and feces should be discarded promptly and away from other horses. Non-porous surfaces like stall mats and walls can be disinfected with bleach. However, pouring bleach or disinfectants on the stall's dirt floors or over manure is not effective.

The LSU VTH is equipped with an isolation facility for equine and farm animal patients, which optimizes the ability to manage and care for equine patients such as those with equine coronavirus or other infectious diseases.

If you think your horse has been exposed to coronavirus or any other virus or disease, please contact your veterinarian immediately.

[The Veterinary Support Services group at the Animal Health Diagnostic Center (AHDC) at the School of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell University has recently received several calls regarding a relatively newly recognized illness in horses. Equine enteric coronavirus has been on the rise in recent years in our area of the northeast, and it seems to be most prevalent during the colder months. In 2013, we received 144 samples, of which 38 were positive or suspect. We have seen positive samples from several states including New York, Missouri, South Carolina, Connecticut, and Vermont.

Equine enteric coronavirus should be on your differential list for a horse whenever you see a fever (usually less than or equal to 104.0 F [40 C]) accompanied by anorexia and lethargy. It is transmitted by the fecal oral route, and signs usually tend to resolve in 1-4 days, although animals can continue shedding for several weeks. For a more complete description of signs and characteristics of this disease, and appropriate sample submission for testing, please take a look at the following fact sheet:

Equine Enteric Coronavirus
Overview: Coronaviruses comprise a large group of RNA viruses that can cause both respiratory and enteric signs of disease in various species. They are further grouped based on genetic and serologic differences into alpha, beta and gamma coronaviruses. The equine coronavirus, a beta coronavirus, has been recently isolated from a number of outbreaks across the country. This is an enteric disease of the equine. At this time, there has been no association with a respiratory component, although in cattle enteric and respiratory disease is common.

Transmission: Fecal-oral route
Survival in environment: Unknown
Age distribution: Most often diagnosed in adults, usually older than 2 years of age.
Seasonality: Seen during the cold weather months (in the northeast areas), December through May.

Common Clinical Signs/Blood test changes
- Anorexia
- Lethargy
- Fever (usually 104.0 or under)
- Changes in fecal character; diarrhea not routinely seen
- Mild colic-like signs (laying down; looking at sides)
- Neurologic abnormalities (ataxia, depression, recumbency) secondary to hyperammonemia
- Leukopenia(neutropenia, lymphopenia)
- Hypoalbunemia

Morbidity ranges from about 20-57 percent (Pusterla et al., 2013), and mortality is typically rare, but secondary complications including dehydration, diminished perfusion, and gastrointestinal translocation, can occur (Pusterla et al., 2013). Hyperammonemia and associated neurological signs may be cause for mortality.

Duration: Signs generally resolve in 1-4 days with supportive care, and outbreaks typically last for about 3 weeks (Pusterla et al., 2013).

AHDC Sample Submission/Requirements

The sample is fresh feces submitted in an unbreakable leak-proof container to the laboratory by overnight courier on ice packs. Samples must be kept chilled to prevent overgrowth of bacteria that may cause inhibition in the PCR testing. Feces are tested by: Equine Enteric Corona PCR. Lag Time: 3-days. For any questions, contact the lab and speak to the VSS, Drs. Mittel, Goodrich and Thompson at 607.253.3900.

Biosecurity/ Control measures:

- If beta coronavirus is on your differential list, encourage the barn to practice appropriate biosecurity measures to control the spread of the virus.
- See the AAEP (American Association of Equine Practitioners) guidelines: http://www.aaep.org/custdocs/BiosecurityGuidelinesFinal030113.pdf for Biosecurity guidelines.
- Horses can continue shedding the virus in their feces for a few weeks (anecdotal reports have shown up to 21 days) from the onset of clinical signs. The virus is shed in the manure. Encourage the farm to take precautions by using footbaths, individual thermometers, and disposable gloves between horses. Attempt to isolate affected animals and handle them last and use separate manure handling equipment from the rest of the barn. Minimize traffic into/out of barn.
