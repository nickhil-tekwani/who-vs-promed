2700 animals vaccinated against anthrax in Bongo
------------------------------------------------
The Upper East Regional Veterinary Officer, Thomas Anyorikeya, says about 2700 animals have so far been vaccinated against anthrax in Balungo and Bongo communities in the Bongo District.

He said his department has asked for more logistics [support] from the central government to contain the disease in the region.

Mr. Anyorikeya told George Asekere that there is no cause for alarm.

Meanwhile, the Assemblyman for the Balungo electoral area, Edward Abisiwine, who is currently on the field, says the situation is under control.

[I am always impressed by how competent the Ghanaian veterinary service is though constrained by poor funding. I just wish they could get support for an effective 5-year proactive vaccination programme in the Upper East Region. - Mod.MHJ
