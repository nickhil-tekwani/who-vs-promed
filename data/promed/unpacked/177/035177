Parasite attacks bees, cuts honey output, pollination
----------------------------------------------
The buzzing behind Howard Crawford's farmhouse in Franklin is usually
unmistakable, the busy sound of about a half-million bees. But nowadays
things are a little quieter than usual.
Crawford, 82, lost hundreds of thousands of bees from 5 of his 21 hives
after an attack this winter by parasites that feed on bee blood.
''It's very serious," said Crawford, a usually jovial man who has been
raising bees for honey and to pollinate his apple trees and blueberry
bushes since the late 1950s. ''It's been a struggle. If we don't have the
bees to pollinate, we won't have any blueberries."
The honeybee is under attack. A parasitic mite known as the varroa has cut
the bee population in many states, including Massachusetts, roughly in
half. Specialists say the 8-legged mite has grown resistant to federally
approved pesticides. Coupled with unseasonably cold weather, some
beekeepers are reporting the greatest losses they've experienced in years.
Ted Shylovsky, recording secretary for the Massachusetts Beekeepers
Association, said that members reported losing as many as 60 out of 70
hives because of the parasite. A healthy hive can contain between 40 000
and 60 000 bees.
Medway beekeeper John P. Williams, a member of the Norfolk Beekeepers
Association, estimated he has lost more than 100 000. For area beekeepers,
he said, ''this past year is definitely the worst."
The Massachusetts Beekeepers Association estimates that thousands, perhaps
millions, of dollars' worth of honey will be lost. And there is growing
concern about potential losses for local fruit and vegetable farmers who
depend on honeybees to pollinate their crops during the late spring and
early summer.
The US Department of Agriculture estimates the annual benefit nationally of
bee pollination at $15 billion. The honeybee helps pollinate more than 100
crops, including broccoli, oranges, melons, and almonds.
Even area gardeners may find their cucumbers are not as big or their
tomatoes as plentiful this spring, said Shylovsky, a Sudbury beekeeper, who
estimated that his bees help fertilize dozens of large local gardens.
''It isn't just the honey that is of value," he said. ''Without good
pollination, all these local gardens might not produce nice fruit."
The varroa attaches itself to an adult bee or burrows into the cocoonlike
cells of developing bees to lay its own eggs, specialists say. Mark F.
Feldlaufer, leader of the USDA bee research laboratory in Beltsville,
Maryland., said as many as 5 female varroa mites can lay dozens of eggs in
a single cell containing a developing bee.
Fighting the mite is a constant problem, he added, because pesticides must
be developed to kill the mite but not the bee. And it can't contaminate the
honey, which will be eaten by humans.
In California, almond growers resorted to bringing beehives in by truck to
pollinate their plants during their February and March blossom season. In
New England, the blossom season for apples and blueberries is underway.
Cranberries bloom from mid-June through July.
In Massachusetts, there are roughly 4000 acres of apple orchards and 13 000
of acres of cranberries, according to the University of Massachusetts
Extension Service in Amherst, a program that helps growers produce better
crops. It takes roughly 2 hives to pollinate an acre of crop, the extension
service said.
Many local farmers, learning from California, have ordered truckloads of
beehives to help with the pollination. Professor Carolyn DeMoranville,
director of the University of Massachusetts Cranberry Station, said it is
too early to tell what effect the depletion of bees will have on the fruit
crop.
''There is no question that the problem is getting worse," she said. ''The
potential is there for this to become a big issue. It's going to depend on
how all this plays out and whether there are enough bees to go around."
Crawford said he gets stung as many as 100 times a year, but it's more than
worth it to produce his award-winning honey. He said that last year, he
produced 1900 pounds of honey, which he generally sells to local clients by
the jar. He also uses it to make a skin cream, which he says doctors have
used to treat such ailments as bedsores. And he has a steady number of
clients who also visit his farm each year to pick fruit from his 200 apple
trees and 75 blueberry bushes.
But he is concerned that there may not be much to pick this year. He
purchased more queen bees in hopes of rebuilding his hives.
''If you don't pay attention to your bees, they're going to disappear,"
Crawford said. ''Beekeeping is a lot of work today. It used to be fun. You
have to be like a doctor to the bees."

[Clearly this disease has an impact on bee producers, the honey industry,
and the produce industry, which relies on the bees for pollination of
various plants.
Varroa is a reportable disease according to OIE. Manual of Diagnostic Tests
and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals Chapter Part 2, Section 2.9, Chapter
2.9.5.
An excerpt from that chapter includes:
"The mite _Varroa destructor_ (formerly _Varroa jacobsoni_) is a parasite
of adult bees and their brood. It penetrates the intersegmental skin
between the abdominal sclera of adult bees to ingest haemolymph. It can
sometimes be found between the head and thorax. The number of parasites
steadily increases with increasing brood activity and the growth of the bee
population, especially late in the season when clinical signs of
infestation can first be recognised. The life span of the mite depends on
temperature and humidity but, in practice, it can be said to last from some
days to a few months.
Identification of the agent: The clinical signs of varroosis can only be
recognised at a late stage of infestation, so that diagnosis entails the
examination of the hive debris. The debris produced during the summer is
especially useful for diagnosis. The earliest and most precise diagnosis
can be made only after the application of a medication that forces the
mites to drop off the bees or kills them directly. Larger amounts of debris
can be examined using a flotation procedure. Bees are washed in petroleum
spirit, alcohol or detergent solution. However, this method is less
accurate due to the unequal distribution of mites and the usually small
sample sizes.
In heavily infested bee colonies, clinical signs of varroosis can often
first be seen in the latter part of the season when the brood is reduced.
Heavy infestations are usually reached 3-4 years after the primary
invasion, but can occur within weeks if infested by bees from nearby
colonies that are collapsing.
Essentially, the brood is damaged by the parasitic mites. Bees and their
offspring that have been infected during the brood phase by only one
parasitic mite show various ill effects, such as a shortened life span,
changes in behaviour and an increased disease susceptibility. The
parasitism is critical if more than one mite enters the brood cell for
reproduction. Only in the lethal stage immediately before the collapse of
the colonies do clinical signs, such as shrunken wings and shortened
abdomen, appear . This is due to an increased susceptibility to deformed
wing and acute paralysis virus, as well as to the infection of wounds and
loss of haemolymph. If the brood dies shortly before or after sealing,
clinical signs of European foulbrood appear without the presence of the
specific agent _Melissococcus pluton_. If the brood survives, the emerging
bees show various behavioural changes and their life span is considerably
shortened."
Although there are many tests to verify the presence of the mite, there
apears to be little in the way of treatment for the colonies. There are
some products providing limited success. From the OIE chapter cited above:
"There are no biological products and vaccines available. Formic acid,
oxalic acid, lactic acid and thymol can be used to control Varroa mites
(<http://www.apis.admin.ch/english/Themes/Varroa.htm>). Some hygienic
strains are less susceptible to Varroa parasites." - Mod.TG]
