Wild boar deaths on French coast baffle authorities
---------------------------------------------------
The mysterious death of 36 wild boars on France's northwestern coast
baffled authorities on Tuesday [2 Aug 2011] after tests suggested
large amounts of rotting seaweed strewn across beaches may not be to
blame. Environmentalists had said that toxic, foul-smelling hydrogen
sulfide gas emitted by the rotting seaweed had poisoned the animals in
the Cotes d'Armor region of Brittany.

Ecologists say that nitrates pollution in rivers from fertilizers used
in intensive farming has boosted the growth of algae along France's
coastline. However, tests on the bodies of 6 wild boars found widely
ranging traces of the gas and one carcass showed no signs of the gas
at all.

"With such a wide difference in the values, we cannot reach any
conclusion," said a spokesman for the local prefecture.

The beach near the town of Morieux where most of the animals were
found in late July [2011] has been closed to the public. Authorities
are considering a range of possibilities for the deaths, which have
been front page news in France, such as deliberate poisoning of the
animals.

The government launched a plan to fight against the spread of seaweed
along the coast in 2009 after an asphyxiated horse found in Cotes
d'Armor was discovered to have a large amount of hydrogen sulfide in
its body.

[On top of eco-toxicological factors, which seem to be the priority
candidates for the scenario as described, infectious diseases --
though rather unlikely -- deserve to be excluded by lab
investigations. - Mod.AS]

[Hydrogen sulphide is capable of dissipating, even after it has caused
death. Consequently, not finding rotten seaweed in the stomach does
not mean the animal did not inhale sufficient quantities of the gas to
die from it. - Mod.TG]
