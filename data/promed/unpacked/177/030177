Vulture deaths in India
-----------------------
Here is an abstract from the "The Hindu" daily in Bangalore from 1 Jun 2003.
"A mystery solved, the killer found! The vulture deaths in India have
been attributed by scientific experiments and necropsy studies by Dr.
Lindsay Oaks of Western Washington Veterinary College in Pullman as
due to Diclofenac (known for humans as Voltaren), which is used
extensively by veterinarians in India as an NSAID [nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drug]. Even at low doses, it is toxic to vultures.
It does not appear to be the West Nile virus as thought first by
many."
Would be interesting to get further comments from Dr. Oaks!

[This is all rather strange. The questions are: how did this painkiller get
into the vultures? Are vets using the drug, then when the treated animal
dies, they throw it in the gutter to be devoured by vultures? Did the drug
first come into wide use in India in the year 2000, when the vultures started
dying? What about in Pakistan & Nepal? Maybe vets practising in the countries
concerned can explain. - Mod.AS, TG, JW]
