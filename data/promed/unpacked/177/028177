Ticks are proliferating in our regions. These parasites can transmit Lyme disease. Several [40] cases were reported in Arlon [Luxembourg Province, Belgium].

A walk in the woods or a simple afternoon spent gardening may send you to the hospital. The hospital Vivalia d'Arlon noticed an important increase of cases of tick bites but also cases of Lyme disease, transmitted by [the] parasite. Pascal Mespouille, a doctor who specializes in neuropsychiatry at the San Jose hospital in Arlon, explained the reasons of this increase: "Climate plays a role in the proliferation of the ticks. Before, they were mainly found in the south of France, but now the ticks are all over Europe. The population of our province is at risk due to the many fields and forests in our region."

Lyme disease is transmitted by tick bites. However, not all wounds are synonymous with Lyme disease. Only the ticks that carry the _Borrelia_ bacteria can transmit the Lyme borreliosis. "In the hospital in Arlon, patients come to have the ticks removed but also to get treated for the disease transmitted by the ticks. If it is detected early, a simple treatment with antibiotics will stop the disease," explained Dr Mespouille. However, some people do not notice a bite immediately. "If untreated, the disease progresses in several stages. Every year, the hospital in Arlon treats between 30 and 40 cases of stage 3 Lyme disease (the most serious). It is an intense intervention, which requires intravenous treatment over 3 weeks. But the hospital in Arlon is well equipped to detect, treat and cure this type of infection," said the doctor who specializes in neuropsychiatry.

The Hydrion Arlon sports center is also concerned by these blood-sucking parasites. The many outdoor activities are a godsend for the ticks in search of blood. "We are counting on prevention: we recommend the parents to thoroughly check their children when they return home. When a child gets bitten, I remove the tick immediately and I disinfect the wound", explained Nicolas Kergen, a Hydrion camp counselor.

The first aid kit at the sports complex allows treatment of tick bites very quickly but not to prevent them: "We have tweezers and antiseptic. Unfortunately, there are only 2 bottles of insect repellent that are reserved for the counselors. If we had to spray all the campers and interns, we would never get by as there are so many," commented the sensitive sports monitor faced with this problem. He added: "We never had any case of infected children. On the other hand, counselors are also at risk; 2 of my colleagues were bitten and contracted Lyme disease. I was bitten by 2 ticks, but I got lucky and was not infected."

Benedicte Jadot, director of the after school programs in Arlon, is also worried about the ugly bugs. Following the example of Hydrion, emphasis is put on prevention. "We ask the parents to pay close attention and to check their child. This summer, we recorded only one single bite on a child. We immediately removed the tick with special tweezers and disinfected the wound. The child did not contract the disease."

[Lyme borreliosis (Lyme disease) is the most common human tick-borne infectious disease in the northern hemisphere, occurring predominately in temperate regions of North America, Europe and Asia. It is caused by pathogenic genospecies of the spirochete, _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato complex, a genetically diverse group of spirochetes (http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/content/42/3/378.full.pdf). Vectors of _B. burgdorferi_ are hard-bodied _Ixodes_ ticks, and various small- and medium-sized mammals and ground-feeding bird species are reservoir-competent hosts.

The species of tick, the host species, borrelial genospecies and carriage rates of borreliae in ticks all vary according to the geographical location. The patterns of disease also differ by geographical location. For example, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans and neuroborreliosis are more common in Europe, whereas arthritis appears to be prevalent in the United States.

At least 3 species of the _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato complex (_B. afzelii_, _B. garinii_, and _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto) are known to cause Lyme disease in humans, although _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto is the only pathogenic species to cause Lyme disease in North America. It also occurs in Europe, but is less prevalent in most regions than _B. garinii_ or _B. afzelii_, the 2 major European pathogenic genospecies.

Individual ticks can be infected with more than one genospecies of _B. burgdorferi sensu lato_ complex. In Europe, _B. burgdorferi_ genospecies that cause Lyme borreliosis are mainly transmitted by the tick _Ixodes ricinus_. In a literature review of studies of the prevalence of _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato in _I. ricinus_ ticks in various European countries, the overall mean prevalence of _B. burgdorferi_-infected ticks was 13.7 percent (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1287732/). For Belgium, the prevalence of _B. burgdorferi_-infected ticks was 23 percent; _B. garinii_ was most prevalent (53 percent of infected ticks), followed by _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto (38 percent) and _B. afzelii_ (9 percent). Of the infected ticks, 40 percent were infected with a single species, 40 percent were infected with 2 species, and 5 percent were infected with all 3 species (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC105328/).

Belgium is divided into 3 regions, Brussels, Flanders and Wallonia; the latter 2 regions are divided in turn into provinces (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Belgium). Arlon, with a population of 275 594 in 2013, is capital city of the Walloon province of Luxembourg. - Mod.ML
