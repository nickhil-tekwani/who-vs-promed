Anthrax Hits Hoima
------------------
The deadly anthrax disease has hit Hoima district, killing 23 head of
cattle in just one week.
Fred Kayizzi writes that the Hoima district extension coordinator, Dr.
Scola Bwali, said the highly infectious disease, which causes sudden death
in animals and humans, has been reported in Buhanika and Kitoba
sub-counties. She said the disease is caused by a bacteria called _Bacillus
anthracis_, which causes massive bleeding. The bleeding often chokes the
lungs and leads to sudden death. The disease is highly contagious.
"I am very worried. This disease can strike a family and kill everybody
there," Bwali said. She said the district had petitioned the Commissioner
for Veterinary Services, Dr. Kauta, for action.
