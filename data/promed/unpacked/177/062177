CIA Director John Deutsch has called chemical and biological warfare the
most urgent threat to U.S. national security. This week the U.S.Marine
Corps activates its Chemical & Biological Incident Response Force, 350
marines and sailors geared to respond to such attacks against U.S.
diplomatic missions and military installations world-wide. The Force will
be linked by computer to a team of civilian experts led by Dr Joshua
Lederberg, president emeritus of Rockefeller University.
