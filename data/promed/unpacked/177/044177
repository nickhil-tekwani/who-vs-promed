A 16-month-old Bernalillo County girl is recovering from plague, the
county's 1st human case this year [2009] and the state's 5th,
according to the Albuquerque Vector-Borne and Zoonotic Disease
Division. The city [officials] said the girl was likely exposed to the
plague in the East Mountains, and investigators are gathering more
information on how she was exposed.

Officials also believe the girl's great-grandfather was also infected
with plague, but they're still awaiting final test results.

Family pets are also prone to the plague and could carry infected
fleas home to their owners. Dogs may not show symptoms, the city said,
but cats may develop swollen lymph nodes in the neck, become
lethargic, suffer a fever or lose their appetite. Officials suggest
that pet owners use flea control on their pets, keep them away from
dead rodents or rodent burrows, and prevent them from roaming or
hunting. They should also take sick pets to a veterinarian.

People should also avoid sick or dead rodents, keep their distance
from wildlife and prevent rodents from living near their homes by
removing trash and weeds and getting wood piles off the ground.

[Although not stated, it is likely that the child had the bubonic form
of _Yersinia pestis_ infection, the most common manifestation of
plague in humans.
