[The previous message, on the suspect BSE case in the US (BSE, bovine -
USA: susp. 20040626.1713), contained the following statement in the article
posted by ProMED-mail: "The announcement came late Friday, and officials
sought to downplay the potential gravity of the preliminary result, which
they said wasn't unexpected given the test's sensitivity."]
I'm sure you are bombarded with this type of response. I hope that the
message the US authorities are trying to give is that this is a false
positive result, and so it isn't unexpected given the test's (presumably
less than 100 percent) specificity, as opposed to its sensitivity. If there
are problems with the sensitivity of the test, it would be missing true
positives, and I'm sure that isn't what they want to say.
