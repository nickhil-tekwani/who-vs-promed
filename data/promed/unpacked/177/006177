Risk soars in organic chickens
------------------------------
Free-range and organic chickens are twice as likely to carry a food
poisoning bacteria than battery hens, research said yesterday. Initial
findings from a study sponsored by the Government show much higher levels
of campylobacter in flocks reared outdoors.
The study, led by Prof Tom Humphrey at the University of Bristol,
investigated 60 organic and 130 conventional flocks. He found campylobacter
in 58 percent of indoor-reared flocks, but in all the organic flocks. All
chickens studied were destined for human consumption.
Campylobacter and _E. coli_, Britain's most common bacterial causes of food
poisoning, are thought to be carried by wild birds, a theory explaining
high levels in outdoor-bred flocks.
Prof Humphrey, professor of food safety and well-known for his work on
bacteria in poultry and eggs, was unavailable for comment. His research is
sponsored by the Food Standards Agency, whose spokesman said: "The birds
that remained outside were organic and free-range so it is therefore more
about the method of production."
Richard Young, policy adviser at the Soil Association, which campaigns for
organic food and farming, said: "If there is an issue here it is about
whether chickens should be kept indoors or outdoors and not whether they
are organic or conventional." The research was incomplete and not
peer-reviewed.

[In September 2000, the chairman of the (then newly established) Food
Standards Agency (FSA), Sir John Krebs, said in an interview to the BBC
that organic food consumers were "not getting value for money, in my
opinion and in the opinion of the Food Standards Agency, if they think
they're buying food with extra nutritional quality or extra safety". Sir
John based his statement upon the results of research by scientists at the
Eclipse Scientific Group laboratory in Cambridgeshire. As expected, a
bitter public debate encompassing the British parliament ensued.
In a recent submission of FSA to the Welsh Assembly on organic food (Mon,
27 May 2002) the FSA indicated that on the basis of current evidence, the
Agency's assessment is that organic food is not significantly different in
terms of food safety and nutrition from food produced conventionally. FSA's
views on organic food are at:

Campylobacteriosis is an infectious disease caused by bacteria of the genus
Campylobacter. The Campylobacter organism is actually a group of
spiral-shaped bacteria that can cause disease in humans and animals.
_Campylobacter jejuni_ has become a major public health hazard and the main
etiologic contributor -- at least, quantitatively -- to food poisoning in
many countries, with contaminated raw poultry meat playing the main role
(See "Campylobacter jejuni -- An Emerging Foodborne Pathogen", S. F.
Altekruse et al, EID, Vol 15 No 1, Jan-Mar 1999
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol5no1/altekruse.htm> ).
Most human illness is caused by _Campylobacter jejuni_, but 1 percent of
human Campylobacter cases are caused by other species. Most people who
become ill with campylobacteriosis get diarrhea, cramping, abdominal pain,
and fever within 2 to 5 days after exposure to the organism. The diarrhea
may be bloody and can be accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The illness
typically lasts one week. Some persons who are infected with Campylobacter
don't have any symptoms at all. In persons with compromised immune systems,
Campylobacter occasionally spreads to the bloodstream and causes a serious
life-threatening infection. According to the US Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC), Campylobacter is the most common bacterial cause of
diarrheal illness in the United States. Virtually all cases occur as
isolated, sporadic events, not as a part of large outbreaks. Even though
surveillance is very limited, over 10 000 cases are reported to the CDC
each year, equaling approximately 6 cases for each 100 000 persons in the
population. Many more cases go undiagnosed or unreported, and
campylobacteriosis is estimated to affect over 2 million persons every
year, or 1 percent of the population.
An FSA survey announced in August 2001 indicated that 50 per cent of
UK-produced retail chickens are contaminated with campylobacter. It has
become the single biggest identified cause of food poisoning in the UK. The
emergence of Quinolone and Macrolide resistance in _Campylobacter jejuni_
is a reason for additional concerns. Reducing campylobacter levels in
chickens is an essential part of the Agency's commitment to cutting food
poisoning cases in the UK by 20 percent by 2006. FSA's Advisory Committee
on the Microbiological Safety of Food (ACMSF), of which Professor Tom
Humphrey is a member, is playing a key role in tackling the campylobacter
issue.
The current posting, ostensibly based upon his group's research (yet to be
published), might be followed by renewed and heated debates between
supporters and opponents of the ever-growing organic agriculture movement
(in a recent poll by the FSA, 64 percent of the participants indicated they
buy organic food). - Mod.AS]

cook the chicken right, and you won't get sick" - Mod.MPP]
