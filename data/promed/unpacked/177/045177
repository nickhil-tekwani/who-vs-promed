Excess sea turtle deaths
------------------------
Near record numbers of sea turtles were found dead in Florida during the
past 2 years, with numbers increasing in Palm Beach County, south to the
Keys. But Treasure Coast waters were a relative safe haven, state
scientists said on Thursday.
State statistics on the mortality rates of loggerhead, leatherback, green,
Kemp's ridley, and hawksbill turtles showed deaths on the Treasure Coast
decreased overall in 2002. Elsewhere in the state, the numbers of sea
turtles found dead or debilitated decreased, but were second only to 2001's
figure, which was the worst since monitoring began in 1980, said Allen
Foley, a wildlife biologist with the Florida Marine Research Institute.
"There are a lot of turtles, a lot of different populations, and a lot of
potential mortality factors," he said, but added that on the Treasure
Coast, "You just happen to be in a window where the turtles were pretty happy."
The increase in numbers of dead turtles from Palm Beach County to the Keys
was due in part to "lethargic loggerhead syndrome. The end of 2000 and
through 2001, we had 49 live loggerheads wash ashore with similar symptoms;
they were lethargic and almost paralyzed. They couldn't lift their heads
out of the water to breathe," Foley said, adding that the syndrome might be
related to a parasite that affects a turtle's brain. That syndrome has not
been documented north of Palm Beach County. The exact cause of "lethargic
loggerhead syndrome" is not known, said Larry Wood, executive director of
the Marinelife Center of Juno Beach. The non-profit rehabilitation center
is caring for a turtle with a stiff jaw that may be part of the same
syndrome, but may not be, he said. "They get neurologically depressed, very
floppy, seems like their muscle control is gone," Wood said. Turtles with
that syndrome that the center has successfully treated and released "took
almost a year to come back from," he said.
In the 3-county Treasure Coast area, 128 turtles were found dead in 2002,
compared with 151 in 2001, 128 also in 2000, and 122 in 1999. Statewide,
there were at least 1250 dead turtles in 2002, second only to 2001's record
of 1337.
The Treasure Coast's lack of shrimp trawling is a key reason why there were
not high numbers of dead sea turtles, Foley said. Turtles, which must come
to the water's surface to breathe air, often become entangled in deep-water
shrimping nets and drown. Openings that are mandated to be cut in the nets
are too small to allow full-grown loggerhead turtles to escape, Foley said.
Long-line fishing, more popular in Brevard County and north, can also cause
turtles to become entangled in fishing line, which can cause accidental
amputation of a flipper or even drowning.
Shrimp trawling and long-line fishing rarely occur on the Treasure Coast
and south because the continental shelf is too narrow, said Erik Martin, an
environmental specialist with Ecological Associates, the Jensen Beach-based
company that tracks sea turtle activity in Martin County. "That's not to
say everything is OK," he said. "We'd really like to see a decrease in the
number of strandings (deaths) that are related to human things, like
boating and fishing." He said the program to recycle monofilament fishing
line, created by Demma Bailey with the Environmental Studies Center, is a
good way to decrease drowning and other injuries to turtles locally.
Foley said the main cause of injuries to sea turtles on the Treasure Coast
and statewide remains boating accidents. However, it is usually uncertain
whether the turtle was dead before it was hit. "The Treasure Coast is
noticeably above average for boat-related injuries, but not nearly as much
as Palm Beach," he said. Of the 128 turtles found dead in Indian River, St.
Lucie, and Martin counties, 44 had boat-related injuries, he said.

[In general the fall in sea turtle numbers, especially in the Gulf of
Mexico, has been ascribed to shrimp nets, a major problem. Without sound
denominators (always a problem with wildlife population studies) it is hard
to interpret numerators such as animals found dead or sick and therefore
whether something is getting worse or better. Probably the only reliable
number is the number of egg-laying landing adult female turtles. Boats are
also a major problem for manatees in Florida. Florida wildlife authorities
have begun to release baby turtles offshore in hopes of offsetting the high
losses when they enter the surf from birds and other predators awaiting
them. As they mature slowly, it will be a decade or so before any benefits
may be observed. Comments on this report are welcomed. - Mod.MHJ]
