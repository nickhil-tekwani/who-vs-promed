Panic has gripped residents of Malindi and Magarini districts
following signs of water contamination in the upper reaches of the
River Sabaki. Hundreds of fish have died as the National Environment
Management Authority (Nema) issued an alert to the residents.

Reports from Galana area said several people had begun suffering from
diarrhoea after eating the dead fish floating in the river. However,
Malindi district environment officer Samuel Nganga said his
department was not aware of this. "If any person has been affected,
they have not reported to us. Maybe they have not even gone to
hospital," he said.

Samples of water from the river have been taken to government
laboratories for analysis to determine the levels of poison in the
water. Malindi Water and Sewerage Company (Mawasco) chief executive
officer Johnson Randu said a private company had also taken samples
for analysis. Mr Nganga said the fish deaths could only be a result
of water poisoning.

"We have found dead fish floating down the river. There is a problem
upstream, and we are trying to establish the cause," he said. "We are
liaising with other government departments and in collaboration with
the private sector to determine the levels of contamination. At the
moment, we don't know what chemical is causing the deaths of fish,"
he added. He said public awareness campaigns are ongoing.

Chiefs' barazas and other methods are being used to inform the people
about the danger.

"We are telling the people not to eat the dead fish because it's
dangerous. They should wait until it is determined what killed them,"
he said, adding that the laboratory results will be out in 14 days
and will be made public.

The river is the lifeline for thousands of residents from Mount Kenya
areas, where the river has its source, through Ukambani and down to
the Indian Ocean in Malindi Town.

People use the river water for agricultural purposes, domestic use
and for their animals.

Most people use the water without treating it.

[Apparently, it seems that not the dead fish but water safety is the
true issue of the described event. Any information on the inquiry
results becoming available will be welcomed. - Mod.AS]
