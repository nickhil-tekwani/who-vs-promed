Six raccoons picked up by Arlington County Animal Control in North Arlington in recent weeks have tested positive for canine distemper, the county said Thursday [11 Mar 2021].

Five of the raccoons were removed from various neighborhoods in North Arlington over a 3 week period after showing neurological signs and symptoms, according to Animal Welfare League of Arlington spokeswoman Chelsea Jones. Those raccoons were euthanized due to their condition. The 6th raccoon tested was found dead in the same area with the cause of death unknown.

Distemper is a viral disease that is present in wildlife populations at varying levels. Raccoons are especially susceptible to canine distemper, as well as foxes, coyotes, skunks and unvaccinated dogs. Distemper does not affect humans.

No people or pets had contact with the 6 raccoons that were all confirmed positive for canine distemper, Jones said in an email.

Starting last November [2020], Arlington County Animal Control began receiving reports of sick and dead raccoons in neighborhoods in North Arlington. The raccoons began appearing in the Donaldson Run community but have since been found in various neighborhoods spanning the length of North Arlington, Jones said.

Two raccoons in the Rock Spring neighborhood that appeared sick between November [2020] and February [2021] were sent for testing as a result of potential contact with a domestic animal. One of those raccoons tested positive for rabies. In a separate incident, animal control officers trapped a raccoon on 30 Jan 2021 spotted in the area of the 6900 block Williamsburg Boulevard in Arlington. The animal later tested positive for rabies. With the rash of positive tests for both distemper and rabies, the county said the outbreak is no longer contained to a specific neighborhood. "We are urging residents in North Arlington to be vigilant," the county said in a statement.

Distemper is transmitted when animals have direct contact with infected animals or indirect contact with body fluids and feces from an infected animal. Rabies is a disease that both people and animals can catch from the bite or scratch of infected animals and is fatal if medical care is not given promptly.

Residents should ensure their pets are up to date on their rabies and distemper vaccines. The county is recommending that cats be kept inside and dogs on a leash. Wildlife attractants, such as unsecured garbage cans, open containers of food and compost, should be removed from yards, the county said.

The raccoons have been showing neurological signs and symptoms, which is abnormal for Arlington's typically healthy raccoon population, Jones said. County animal control officers receive specialized training in disease recognition and identification and therefore began to flag the increase in illness from the start, she added.

[Canine distemper virus is the pathogen most frequently causing outbreaks at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface. As distemper and rabies affect the central nervous system, they both cause behavior disorders. Distemper usually results in stumbling and lack of "shyness"; they can seem "dumb" and/or "friendly." Animals showing similar behavioural signs might, alternatively, be rabid.

It is very important to make sure to keep the vaccination schemes of all dogs, cats and ferrets in the area up to date. - Mod.PMB
