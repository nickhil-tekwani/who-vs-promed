2003/070 Surveys carried out in Estonia: absence of _Synchytrium
endobioticum_
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The NPPO of Estonia recently informed the EPPO Secretariat of the
results of surveys carried out in 2002 for _Synchytrium
endobioticum_ [Se] (EPPO A2 quarantine pest). In the past, Se
had been found in 3 districts: Rapla district (one site) in 1949, Voru
district (10 sites) in the 1970s and Valga district (2 sites) in 1985. In
all cases, phytosanitary measures were immediately taken and the
disease was eradicated.
In 2002, 26 samples were taken from all previously infected sites
and their vicinity. In addition, random samples were taken in other
districts. All samples were analysed in the laboratory and Se was not
found.
The situation of Se in Estonia can be described as follows: Absent,
found in the past but now declared eradicated, confirmed by survey.

[Se causes a very serious disease in potato and other _Solanum_
species. Its spores can remain viable for many years. It would
appear that conditions for survival of the spores were favorable but
eventually they lost their viability. Diseased tubers are obvious.
Disease management involves preventing spread of infected tubers,
washing machinery and tools to remove adhering soil, and use of
resistant cultivars. Infected tubers are not marketable, hence crop
loss can be directly related to disease incidence.
Note: This report also included a piece about a disease in forest
trees that was deleted, since ProMED-mail monitors major food
crops only. - Mod.DH]
