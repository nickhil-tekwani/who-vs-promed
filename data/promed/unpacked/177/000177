6 people have died and 3 are in hospital at Grootfontein after drinking a
potent home brew that wiped out half of the workforce at a farm 35 km east
of the northern town.

Police yesterday confirmed that a home-brewed alcoholic drink caused the
poisoning that killed the workers. However, investigations are underway to
determine whether a certain chemical in the beverage might have killed the
men who drank the maize-based brew.

"The ones who drank a lot were the first to die. Some drank a little and
threw it away after finding it tasted bad. But all the workers who drank
the stuff had to go to the hospital," said Sandra Felisberto, owner of farm
Fiume where they were employed.

Nothing seemed out of place last week Thursday, when Masonga Ben Milonga
began to concoct the drink in a "big drum" for a weekend of merry-making.
Police suspect that Milonga might have brewed the drink with stolen maize
that had been sprayed with pesticide.

The workers started drinking it on Friday. That evening, one of the
workers fell ill, said Felisberto in a telephone interview yesterday. He
was rushed to the hospital at Grootfontein, where nurses suspected it was
malaria. They sent him home after treatment.

The first worker was vomiting and complained of diarrhoea. The following
morning, 37-year-old Milonga, who brewed the "stuff", himself needed to be
rushed to hospital.

"The first ones did not get better. They were shaking and screaming," said
Felisberto.

3 more workers showed the same symptoms, including delirium. By Sunday
night more workers had fallen ill.

"They were saying their chests were burning and their hearts were suddenly
beating very fast. It could not have been malaria," said Felisberto, whose
husband reported the mysterious incidents to the Police.

The hospital staff began to suspect poisoning. They told the workers to
drink a lot of milk to neutralize the poison. At least 12 workers were
treated.

Dr Farid Zam, Principal Medical Officer for the Grootfontein health
district, said they admitted 9 patients who were vomiting, confused and
complaining of stomach pains.

"Some were brought in unconscious, [or] they fell unconscious very
quickly," said Dr Zam, adding that "they drank something. That's the story
we [know]." By Monday morning, 2 workers had died.

Late in the evening the same day, 2 more workers succumbed to the potion,
which Police claim is tombo, but workers told Grootfontein councillor Peter
Mbwale Kawana that it was "okatokele".

2 more workers died yesterday morning; 3 workers remain in hospital in a
stable condition, said Dr Zam.

"With God's help, we hope we will save them," said the doctor.

The hospital said it had sent a "specimen" for toxicological tests and were
waiting for results.

Police named those the 6 who died.

Dr Zam would not say what the actual cause was until the results were back,
but doctors at the hospital have told him that similar incidents occur
every 2 or 3 years.
