Health Department officials are having a tough time tackling the dreaded Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), commonly known as monkey fever, in the Karulai forest region near here, thanks to the lukewarm response by the tribal people. Among the 204 Cholanaikkan tribes living here, only 111 have received preventive vaccination. The disease was 1st found among 4 Cholanaikkan tribals in July this year [2014].

The district administration decided to conduct a special camp at Manjeri tribal colony on Wednesday [3 Dec 2014] to persuade more tribals to receive the vaccination. Cases of monkey fever were reported from the Nagamala tribal colony here.

One tribal who tested positive for the disease forcefully sought discharge from the hospital and went back to the forest during treatment. Adding to the concern, 5 monkeys have been found in the Karulai forest region in the last few days. The health officials suspect monkey fever behind the incident, and they are waiting for test results to confirm the cause.

"We have got enough medicine [vaccine?] for preventive activities in the tribal area. The disease was found on a person who did not take the vaccination. We hope that the medical camp at Manjeri on Wednesday [3 Dec 2014] will attract more tribals," District Medical Officer Dr V Ummer Farooq said.

Last 4 Jul [2014], persons from the Cholanaikkan community were tested positive with the disease. The Health Department soon started preventive measures and conducted awareness programmes. The tribals' cold response poses a hindrance to the vaccination drive.

"The tribals are not familiar with such preventive measures. The disease will not spread from human to human. Monkey fever is transmitted to human beings through a species of ticks usually found on monkeys.

[This report illustrates the difficulty that preventive vaccination efforts can face among certain ethnic groups, despite the occurrence of fatalities. There have been previous reports of Kyasanur forest disease (KFD) cases in several area in Kerala state and adjoining Karnataka state this year (2014). KFD virus is endemic in this area. As noted in the ProMED post of 1 Mar 2014 (archive no. 20140304.2313813), the disease was 1st detected in Shimoga district, Karnataka state in 1957 and has since appeared sporadically in the thickly wooded areas of Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, Chikmagalur, Shimoga, and Chamarajanagar (all in Karnataka state), where it is endemic. The disease occurs in humans and monkeys.

Although the virus has been isolated from 16 species of ticks, _Haemaphysalis spinigera_ is the major vector. Most human cases occur during the dry season. KFD virus is a member of the _Flaviviridae_ family. Additional information is available from the CDC fact sheet (see: http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/Fact_Sheets/KyasanurForestDis.pdf).

A report on these KFD cases was submitted by Biju Soman. It was in in Malayalam, a local language in Kerala state. ProMED-SoAs Mod.GS arranged with a colleague for an English language translation. The report is essentially the same as the one above. Biju Soman and Mod.GS and his colleague who did the translation are thanked for their contributions.

Karulai, a small town and forest area and panchayath in Nilambur Taluk of Malappuram district, is on the banks of the Karimpuzha River.
