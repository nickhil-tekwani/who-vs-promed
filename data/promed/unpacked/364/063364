Unidentified disease threatens production of kaki
-------------------------------------------------
A disease not yet identified threatens to decimate the plantations of
kaki [persimmon] in the municipality of Campina Grande do Sul.
Ricardo Lubaszewski, EMATER [Parana Institute of Technical Assistance
and Rural Extension], said the disease appeared in the region 3 years
ago and has been gradually reducing [production]. In this [2010]
harvest, he said, some producers have had losses of 100 percent.

It is a worrying situation because the disease is established in 90
hectares [222 acres] and involves nearly 200 farmers with an average
annual production of 2000 tons. "The worst thing is that we do not
know what it is. At first it seemed like a severe variety of a
fungus, but no known control has given positive results," said
Lubaszewski. "We need rapid diagnosis to prevent compromising this
crop that is traditional and of great economic and social importance
for the region."

Diseases with similar symptoms appeared 6 years ago in kaki
plantations in northern Parana, moving later to producing regions of
Sao Paulo, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul, with dramatic
effects for the producers. Still, however, there is no description of
its origin and characteristics, and therefore no efficient means of control.

[Persimmon (_Diospyros kaki_) is an important fruit in Asia and
increasingly worldwide. Major diseases of the crop are mainly due to
fungi. While it is reported above that management techniques aimed at
common fungi were unsuccessful, a fungal cause cannot be excluded
without further information since, for example, fungal strains
resistant to the agrochemicals used could have emerged. It would also
need to be verified whether the diseases reported to have occurred
earlier elsewhere in the country had the same cause.
