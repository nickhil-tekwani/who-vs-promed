[According to the report above, a total of 82 929 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4633 deaths, representing an increase of 3 cases in the 24 hours since yesterday's (12 May 2020) report. The newly reported cases are all indigenous cases, 2 in Liaoning province and 1 in Jilin. In Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases had been reported daily, there were 3 newly confirmed cases reported in the past 24 hours. Macau and Taiwan have reported no newly confirmed cases. There have been a total of 1692 imported cases reported.

There were 12 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, 7 locally acquired cases and 1 imported case. There were no cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 712, and 36 of these are importations from abroad. I realize it is repetitious mentioning this on a daily basis but..... It would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic, in order to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly. It is apparent that there is most likely thorough contact tracing and testing to explain the daily reports of asymptomatic infections in addition to the screening of individuals arriving from overseas.

As a reminder, it was reported on 24 Mar 2020 that China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. In the past week or so, there have been locally transmitted clusters reported -- Guangdong, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Wuhan. The world is watching carefully to see whether this was safe timing to lift the lockdown. The worrisome observation vis a vis the cluster in Wuhan is that the virus had most likely been circulating there undetected until the cluster was identified.

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 29 cases and 1 deaths compared with yesterday's 24-hour period (12 to 13 May 2020) when there were 26 newly confirmed cases and 1 death. A total of 10 991 confirmed cases and 260 deaths were reported today (13 May 2020), up from 10 962 cases and 259 deaths yesterday (12 May 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 41 consecutive days and below 50 for 34 consecutive days. For several days, the count was below 10 but started climbing over the last 6 days. Of concern is that all but 3 of the newly confirmed cases were locally transmitted today (13 May 2020) and 4 yesterday (12 May 2020). 12 of the 29 newly confirmed cases were in Incheon, 6 in Gyeonggi , 4 in Seoul, 3 were in Chungbuk and 1 each in Gangwon, Chungnam, Jeonnam, and Gyeongbuk. One case each in Seoul, Jeonnam, and Gyeongbuk were the imported cases, the remaining 26 cases were locally acquired.

Figure 1: Daily confirmed cases by chain of transmission covers the period 1 Apr 2020 through 13 May 2020, on the English language page (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030) is striking in the 10 day period with minimal local transmission and predominant importation, and the recent shift (5-13 May 2020) when local transmission replaced the majority imported cases.

As they move to the next phase -- "distancing in daily life" -- all eyes will be on the country to see whether they can maintain the level of control they have had. Importations continue to be a main problem, but the growing Itaewon nightclub cluster is a major concern at this time. With the outbreak associated with the Itaewon club district in Seoul, there may be a rethinking of next steps.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 222 104 cases, including 31 106 deaths, up from 221 216 cases and 30 911 deaths reported on 12 May 2020. The 24-hour change between 12 and 13 May 2020, was 888 newly confirmed cases, compared with 1402 newly confirmed cases between 11 and 12 May 2020, a decrease from previous days' high number. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are also experiencing a decline.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country, in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 72.5% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the main contributor, representing 44.4% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. In addition to Lombardy, Piedmont is the only other province reporting 100 or more newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. 8 provinces reported less than 10 newly confirmed cases (1 province, Umbria, reported no new cases), and another 9 provinces reported fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission. Emilia-Romagna and Liguria are the 2 provinces reporting 50 or more cases (but less than 100).

There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces, where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 63 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 62 days since the countrywide lockdown. The lockdown was extended through 3 May 2020 (see ProMED-mail post 20200411.7211958 for details). All eyes are now on Italy as lockdown restrictions are phased out. See section [7] from COVID-19-update (157): China, S Korea, countries w/ high local transm, Italy phase 2 20200505.7300349 for details on phase 2 opening.

Kianoush Jahanpour on Wednesday [13 May 2020] about the latest data on the coronavirus [COVID-19] in the country and the deaths caused by the virus said, "According to the definitive laboratory findings and from yesterday [12 May 2020] to [13 May 2020] in the country, 1958 new patients with COVID-19 were diagnosed in the country and the number of patients with this disease reached 112 725."

Fortunately, 89 428 patients have recovered and have been discharged so far, Jahanpour added.

He said, "Unfortunately, in the past 24 hours, 50 COVID-19 patients have lost their lives, and 6783 people have lost their lives in the country to date."

The Spokesman stated, "2735 patients are in a critical condition."

"So far, 629 534 COVID-19 diagnosis tests have been conducted in the country," the Health Ministry spokesman said.

[In the 24 hours from 12 to 13 May 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 110 767 to 112 725, an increase of 1958 compared with 1481 newly confirmed cases reported yesterday (12 May 2020). The number of deaths has increased from 6733 to 6783, an increase of 50 deaths in the 24-hour period. In terms of total numbers of confirmed cases, Iran ranks 10th globally, behind the USA, Spain, Russia, the UK, Italy, France, Brazil, Germany, and Turkey (Worldometer data as of 13 May 2020; 17:47 GMT). As with other countries that are lifting business closures, all eyes are on Iran now that "low risk" businesses are opening, and, unfortunately, it appears as though the opening may have been premature. A caution is that there is usually a 2-3 week lag between increasing cases and increases in reported deaths, so relying on the daily number of deaths at this point may be premature as well. Other countries that are rushing to reopen their economies might look at Iran to learn from its experience.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 1 430 348, including 85 197 deaths, an increase from 1 411 017 cases and 83 425 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York state, with 350 848 (24.5%) cumulative case reports and 2193 (10.1%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is still clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing.
Daily reported case counts are high in New York (2193 -- 10.1%), California (1967 -- 9.1%), Illinois (1677 -- 7.7% of total), Texas (1636 -- 7.5%), Massachusetts (1165 -- 5.4%), Pennsylvania (788 -- 3.6%), New Jersey (782 -- 3.6%), Georgia (579 -- 2.7%), and Florida (479 -- 2.2%). In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, Illinois, Massachusetts, California, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Texas, Florida, and Georgia.

Repeating from previous days, more sobering, if you treat each state as a country and insert them in descending cumulative case counts, New York state would be number 1, followed by Spain, Russia, UK, Italy, France, Brazil, Germany, New Jersey, and Turkey as number 10. Number 11 would be Iran, 12 Illinois, 13 China, 14 Massachusetts, 15 India, 16 Peru, 17 California, 18 Canada, 19 Pennsylvania, and 20 Belgium. Illinois has now surpassed China in terms of cumulative case counts, and Russia is now 3rd globally. 6 US states are in the top 20 in terms of cumulative case counts (concept from - Mod.LXL). Even more sobering is that New York City itself would be between Italy and France (it would be number 6).

The US military has confirmed 8210 cumulative cases, with 80 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. The Veteran Affairs reported 11 650 cumulative cases and 186 new cases today (13 May 2020). There have been 3629 cases reported from federal prisons (no new cases in the past 24 hours) and 3245 cases reported from the Navajo Nation (41 newly reported cases in the past 24 hours). Puerto Rico has reported 2329 cases (30 new cases in the past 24 hours). Other states with increased activity include Virginia with 946 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, North Carolina with 728 cases, Maryland with 721 newly confirmed cases, Louisiana with 612 new cases, Minnesota with 423 newly confirmed cases, Connecticut with 522, Iowa with 377 newly confirmed cases and Indiana with 346 newly confirmed cases. 28 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has a growth curve and a table giving demographics (age and ethnicity) where known.

[As per the WHO Situation Report 98 from 27 Apr 2020 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200427-sitrep-98-covid-19.pdf and in COVID-19 update (136): UK NHS increased testing, Brazil, WHO 20200428.7274496), Spain has been reporting only PCR positive confirmations, and not antibody based tests, to WHO, since 25 Apr 2020. The antibody-confirmed cases are now available in Table 4, which presents all cases including all tests performed. There were 661 newly confirmed cases by PCR in the 24-hour period from 12 to 13 May 2020, bringing the PCR [plus number confirmed including all tests] confirmed cumulative total to 228 691 [271 095] cases as compared with 228 030 [269 520] confirmed cases on 12 May 2020.

The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population continues to decrease and is now 25.71, a continual slow decrease over the past 24 days from a high of 214.4 on 7 Apr 2020 to 25.71 today (12 May 2020). Spain has the highest case count in Europe and is 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 228 691 [271 095] cases, an additional 412 cases have been hospitalized, and an additional 65 cases were admitted to ICU. 9.2% of hospitalized patients have been admitted to ICU.

A map of Spain showing provinces (autonomous communities) can be seen at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/spain-administrative-map.htm and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7334684,43.
