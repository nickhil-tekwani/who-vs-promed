Johor Records Sharp Rise in Dengue Cases
----------------------------------------
JOHOR BARU (Malaysia): Some districts in Johor State are registering an
increase of between 5% and 500% in dengue cases,with 15 deaths this year.
Noting that, contrary to this development, the Malaysian national figures
were decreasing, Health Minister Datuk Dr Chua Jui Meng said 85% of the
cases occurred in urban areas, such as the city centre here, where much
construction is in progress. He said construction sites had become breeding
grounds for mosquitoes, as no proper attention was given to clearing pools
of stagnant water.
"The disease is hygiene-related. It is a shame to see well-developed areas
with so many breeding places for mosquitoes," he told reporters here on Sun
12 Nov 2000. Chua, however, praised the State government's effort in
reviving the anti-mosquito campaign. He said that as of 4 Nov 2000, 1205
cases of dengue were reported in the State, compared to 769 cases last year
with 11 deaths. The overall incidence rate has risen by 56% while the
mortality rate is up by 36%. 5 districts registered sharp increases, with
Mersing topping the list (533%), followed by Johor Baru (85%), and Kluang
(43%). Batu Pahat registered a 25% rise and Muar a 5% increase in the
number of dengue cases.
