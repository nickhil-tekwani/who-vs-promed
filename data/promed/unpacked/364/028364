At least 5 dozen [livestock] have died due to foot-and-mouth disease
[FMD] at Rara VDC in Mugu within the past week.

Local Bir Bahadur Bam said the disease has been spreading in Rum,
Gilaha, Kucche, Kalai, Bista Danda and Jaisi villages of wards
numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 at Rara VDC. Some hundreds of cattle have
been affected by the disease. [So far], the disease has claimed the
lives of 40 goats, 10 cows and 5 oxen at the VDC.

In January 2010, FMD was reported from the Gulmi district, central
Nepal, affecting cattle. Later, in May, the disease, including
significant mortality, was -- reportedly -- "officially diagnosed in
wildlife animals" in Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve (far-western
Nepal) by a professional team from the Department of National Parks
and Wildlife Conservation (see in archived 20100111.0124,
20100523.1713). Requests for more information on the causative agent
remain without response.

During 2009, serotypes O and Asia 1 were reported. Further
information, particularly concerning the genotyping of the 2009
isolates, is available at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/asia/nep.htm>.

Laboratory-confirmation of the recent outbreaks, including serotyping
of the virus involved, will be helpful. - Mod.AS]
