Highly pathogenic influenza A viruses (inf. with) (non-poultry including wild birds), Canada
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Started: 12 Apr 2022
Confirmed: 2 May 2022
Reported: 6 May 2022
Reason for notification: unusual host species
Causal agent: Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H5N1
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory
This event pertains to the whole country.

Outbreak location: St. Marys, Perth, Ontario
Started: 12 Apr 2022
Epidemiological unit: not applicable
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Red fox (_Vulpes vulpes_): Canidae-Carnivora / - / 2 / 2 / - / - / -
Affected population: 2 wild fox kits

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with wild species, unknown or inconclusive.
Epidemiological comments: This is the 1st report of highly pathogenic avian influenza in mammals in Canada. The sequencing results indicate that the HA proteins from both red fox kits belongs to Eurasian Gs/GD lineage HPAI H5N1 with cleavage site motif "PLREKRRKR/GLF" compatible with HPAI viruses. The virus from both red foxes contains unique constellation of gene segments with PB2, PB1, PA, and NP belonging to wild bird origin North American lineage influenza A viruses. The remaining gene segments (HA, NA, M, and NS) belong to Eurasian lineage.

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease (NCFAD), Winnipeg, Manitoba National Laboratory
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Red fox / gene sequencing / 2 May 2022 / positive
Red fox / real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) / 2 May 2022 / positive

["The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is currently responding to cases of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in farmed birds across Canada." The latest update on current AI detections in Canada is available at https://inspection.canada.ca/animal-health/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/avian-influenza/hpai-in-canada/eng/1651075538411/1651075538958. - Mod.CRD

Infections by HPAI viruses in mammals are not common, but foxes have shown to be susceptible to infection by HPAI H5N1 and H5N8, and there have been recent reports of cases in wild red foxes in Europe and Japan. Another canid, the raccoon dog, was found infected by HPAI H5N1 in Japan as well. Virus evolution and adaptive mutations must be closely monitored to rapidly identify viruses with increased potential to infect mammals. - Mod.PMB]
