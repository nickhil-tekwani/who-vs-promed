Citation: Stephenson K E. Novel chikungunya vaccine shows promise for durable protection. Lancet Infect Dis. 2022; 22(9): P1259-1261; https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(22)00317-6.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. In the Lancet Infectious Diseases, Sean Bennett and colleagues describe the safety and immunogenicity of PXVX0317, a novel vaccine for the prevention of chikungunya infection based on an adjuvanted virus-like particle (VLP). Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthropod-borne alphavirus transmitted by mosquitoes and causes a febrile illness characterised by severe arthralgia that can lead to chronic disability.

2. There is no approved specific antiviral therapy or vaccine for chikungunya infection. Outbreaks of chikungunya have occurred worldwide -- typically during tropical rainy seasons -- for example, the 2013-14 outbreak in the Americas, which led to more than 1.2 million cases.

3. With expansion and movement of the _Aedes albopictus_ mosquito vector into increasingly warmer climates, chikungunya has become a major arboviral public health threat.
