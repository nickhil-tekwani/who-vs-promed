The country most affected [Paraguay] by this disease continues to
register additional fatal victims. Currently, there are 400 000
infected individuals, and the authorities are not promising that the
situation will improve.
Although the Governor of the central department [state or province
equivalent - Mod.TY] of Paraguay, Federico Franco, informed us that
there are 400 000 infected individuals, the Minister of Health
indicated that there are only 22 000 dengue cases registered officially.
The Europa Press Agency announced today [23 Mar 2007] that 17 persons
have died of DHF. The Paraguayan Minister of Health, Oscar Martinez,
affirmed that the authorities are not "lowering their guard" in their
fight against the epidemic. "The technical brigades go out in the
neighborhoods daily in Asuncion and other cities of the interior to
fumigate with insecticides," said the official. "But the population
must continue to clean up their houses and the surrounding areas.
Water in containers are the principal breeding sites of the mosquito
_Aedes aegypti_, the transmitter of the disease [virus]," he added.

[Apparently the epidemic continues out of control. Fogging with
adulticides will provide only short-term interruption of transmission
if the mosquito vectors continue to breed actively. It is not clear
what measures have been taken to educate the public that they are the
key actors in eliminating these breeding sites, upon which control
will eventually depend.

Dengue is increasing dramatically in Mexico, and specialists predict
a big increase in dengue incidence in all of Latin America. This
epidemic is being driven by a combination of factors, such as climate
change, migration, urbanization and deficiencies in mosquito control
campaigns. Dengue incidence has increased 600 percent since 2001,
and the authorities have sent special [mosquito] eradication teams to
the principal tourism centers in anticipation of the Easter Week
vacation period.
The epidemic also reflects a longer rainy season as well as the
abundance of disposable plastic containers, which retain water and
serve as breeding places for mosquitoes. Immigrant and tourist
travelers transport new strains [dengue serotypes - Mod.TY] of the
virus. The disease is becoming more common and more deadly.
DHF, which can be fatal, is becoming more frequent, with one [DHF
case] in 4 dengue cases, compared with one in 50 six years ago,
according to the Mexican Secretary of Health. [This is an
exceptionally high ratio, probably biased by lack of reporting of
mild cases and a liberal case definition of DHF. Every case with
petechiae or a low platelet count does not automatically qualify as
DHF. Information on the DHF case definition being used would be very
helpful. - Mod.JW]
In past weeks, the Mexican [Health] authorities sent hundreds of
their employees to eradicate mosquitoes in Puerto Vallarta, Cancun
and Acapulco -- the 3 principal tourist destinations -- with the
objective of stopping possible outbreaks during Easter Week, when the
beaches are jammed. "We, the federal and state governments, are
working intensively in these 3 places, which we want to maintain
under control so that there will not be a risk [of dengue infection]
for the tourists," said the Mexican Chief of Epidemiology, Dr. Pablo
Kuri. The Canadian Embassy has issued an alert, after 5 of its
citizens contracted the disease in Puerto Vallarta at the beginning
of the year [2007].
However, the problem is more serious in the poor suburbs that circle
the tropical cities, where trash collection and sanitation are
inferior to those of the tourist areas. The Mexican Secretary of
Health says that dengue is one of the primary public health problems
of the country.
In January and February [2007], 1589 dengue cases were registered, an
increase of 389 percent compared to the same period of last year
[2006], said Kuri. In 2001, there were just 1781 confirmed [dengue]
cases in the entire country. In 2006, there were more than 27 000
cases, with a score of deaths.
The Intergovernmental Commission on Climate Change, which represents
the principal world specialists in the climate change area, predicted
in its March 2007 draft report that global warming and climate change
might cause a sudden increase in dengue incidence. This is what has
happened in Mexico with the prolonged rainy season.

[This is another illustration of the potential economic impact that
dengue could have, if tourists stay away from popular vacation
destinations. Tourism is a substantial generator of economic activity
in Mexico. As the International Commission points out, significant
changes in temperature and precipitation can be expected to alter
both distribution of dengue and the duration and intensity of outbreaks.

The WHO describes dengue fever as a severe, flu-like illness that
affects infants, young children, and adults but is seldom fatal. The
clinical features of dengue fever vary according to the age of the
patient. Infants and young children may have a non-specific febrile
illness with rash (although some infants and very young children may
develop shock syndrome, with sudden loss of circulating fluid volume,
and die). Older children and adults may have either a mild febrile
syndrome or the classical incapacitating disease, with abrupt onset
and high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and
joint pains, and rash.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF] is a potentially deadly complication
that is characterized by high fever, hemorrhagic phenomena -- often
with enlargement of the liver -- and in severe cases, circulatory
failure. The illness commonly begins with a sudden rise in
temperature accompanied by facial flush and other non-specific
constitutional symptoms of dengue fever. The fever usually continues
for 2 to 7 days and can be as high as 40-41 C (104-105.8 F), possibly
with febrile convulsions and hemorrhagic phenomena. In moderate DHF
cases, all signs and symptoms abate after the fever subsides. In
severe cases, the patient's condition may suddenly deteriorate after
a few days of fever; the temperature drops, followed by signs of
circulatory failure, and the patient may rapidly go into a critical
state of shock and die within 12-24 hours or quickly recover
following appropriate volume replacement therapy. There is no
specific treatment for dengue fever. However, careful clinical
management by experienced physicians and nurses frequently saves the
lives of DHF patients. With appropriate intensive supportive therapy,
mortality may be reduced to less than one percent. Maintenance of the
circulating fluid volume is the central feature of DHF case
management. (Abstracted from the WHO website fact sheet on dengue:
