Senegal: Yellow fever epidemic confirmed in interior
-----------------------------------------------
Health authorities launched an emergency yellow fever immunization drive in
one of the most underdeveloped regions of Senegal, after officials
confirmed the killer virus had claimed one life, raising fears of more
deaths to follow.
The confirmation of a single case of yellow fever in Tambacounda last month
[September 2005], some 500 km east of the capital Dakar, is officially an
epidemic according to World Health Organization (WHO) classifications.
"A fatal case of yellow fever was confirmed on [Fri] 30 Sep 2005 in the
Tambacounda region, and we launched a vaccination drive the following
Tuesday to immunize all the population living in the surrounding health
districts," Pape Coumba Faye, the Director of Preventive Medicine at the
Senegalese Health Ministry, told IRIN on Tuesday [11 Oct 2005].
Symptoms of yellow fever, which is transmitted by mosquitoes and can spread
rapidly in urban areas, range from something like a mild flu to hemorrhagic
fever and death.
Though the virus can be vaccinated against, there is no treatment for the
disease once contracted, and the fatality rate in unprotected populations
can exceed 50 percent.
Senegal lies within a band, spanning 15o N to 10o S of the equator, within
which yellow fever is endemic, according to WHO.
However, there has not been a registered case of the disease, which
produces a jaundiced appearance in its victims, since 2003, according to Faye.
Earlier this month [October 2005], nearby Burkina Faso confirmed 4 cases of
yellow fever in the Batie, Gaoua and Banfora districts in the southeast of
the country, near the border with Cote d'Ivoire.
Then, WHO carried out mass-vaccination campaigns either side of the border
to prevent the spread of the disease to densely populated urban settings.
At the end of August 2005, WHO confirmed 10 cases of yellow fever,
including 5 deaths, in the densely forested region of Fouta Djalon,
southeastern Guinea.
It was not immediately clear whether the epidemics were linked.
