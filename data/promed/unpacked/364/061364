The number of syphilis cases in Shasta County is the highest they have ever been. Health professionals are warning sexually active men and women to get tested before they pass the disease on to others. "Very few cases were reported to us for many years but in the last few years syphilis has been really increasing. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease. It's become increasingly common here and it's affecting all kinds of people," County Health Officer, Andrew Deckert, said an overwhelming outbreak of syphilis has spread to sexually active men and women in Shasta County.

From 2006 to 2012 Shasta County saw zero to 3 cases of early stage syphilis each year. In 2016 syphilis cases for the year grew to 24. This year [2018] the outbreak skyrocketed to 62 cases by May of 2018.

Doctor Heidi Bauer, the Chief of the STD Control Program for the California
Department of Public Health said while public health has dealt with sexually transmitted diseases before, syphilis is most concerning for women who are or plan on becoming pregnant. "More recently the concern has been syphilis among women, particularly women of child-bearing age and unfortunately pregnant women, which can lead to congenital syphilis which is an absolutely devastating disease," Bauer noted.

So why the large outbreak? Deckert said the disease is often unnoticed. "One of the reasons it's a big issue is because you don't feel symptoms a lot of times. You may have a small rash that goes away. You can have syphilis, you can transmit it to others and not even know you have it," Deckert explained.

Doctors say early detection is crucial. Syphilis is treatable; however the spread of it is not preventable at the time of delivery. Bauer emphasized early detection is important. If positive, which women usually find out after their 1st prenatal exam if they have not been tested before, it is important to follow up with lab results and treatment. "It basically treats the fetus at the same time it treats the mom," Bauer said.

Doctors recommend anyone who is sexually active, especially those with multiple partners, to get tested.

[The following are provisional data on syphilis for 2017 in the U.S. state of California, supplied by the California Department of Public Health (https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/STDs-CA-2017Snapshot.pdf):

In 2017, the rate of early syphilis was 34.3 cases per 100 000 Californians, an increase of 20 percent over 2016, with 13 605 early syphilis cases reported in 2017 (6633 primary/secondary and 6972 early latent). This was highest number of early syphilis cases since 1987. The rate of early syphilis has been increasing in males since 2000 and in females since 2012. By 2017, the rate of early syphilis in males was 7-fold higher than that in females, 60.3 vs. 8.6. Female cases in 2017 increased nearly 7-fold from less than 250 early syphilis cases reported in 2012. The increase in women occurred during childbearing years, 20-44 years of age and the number of infants born with congenital syphilis has increased for the past 5 years; there were 278 congenital syphilis cases including 30 stillbirths in 2017, an increase of 30 percent over 2016. Congenital syphilis burden of this magnitude was last observed in 1995, over 20 years ago.

Shasta County, with a population of 177 223 residents in 2010, is located in northern portion of the U.S. state of California, with portions extending into the southern reaches of the Cascade Mountain Range; the county seat is the city of Redding, with a population of almost 90 000 residents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redding,_California#Top_employers).
