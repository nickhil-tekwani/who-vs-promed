International conferences on _Mycobacterium ulcerans_ (MU) were held in
April 1998 in Melbourne, Australia and in July 1998 in Yamoussoukro, Cote
d'Ivoire.

The following is a quick summary of current knowledge:

The incidence of MU disease is increasing in many parts of rural West
Africa. The disease is also present widely in other tropical areas, and
for unknown reasons in temperate southeastern Australia. The rising
incidence and high cost of treatment is of major concern to local health
authorities. The WHO have set up the Global Buruli ulcer Initiative (GBUI)
to coordinate and facilitate the fight against this emerging disease.

MU infection causes progressive destructive skin ulcers that often result
in scarring and deformity. In Africa the term Buruli ulcer is used, but the
disease goes by several names. We call it Bairnsdale ulcer and Daintree
ulcer in Australia. The incidence of osteomyelitis may also be increasing.
The only known effective therapy is surgical resection of skin lesions,
although drugs and heat therapy are used with uncertain benefits.
Osteomyelitis may require amputation. Early diagnosis at the pre
ulcerative (nodule) stage appears to be the best approach to prevent
disability and reduce treatment costs. Early detection programs are being
introduced in endemic regions in West Africa.

MU cases usually live near slow flowing water. Despite considerable
effort, no one has successfully cultured MU from any environmental site,
although MU can be cultured from ulcers. In Australia we have identified
an insertion sequence (IS2404) that appears to be specific for MU. Using a
PCR based on this IS, we have been able to identify MU in environmental
samples taken from endemic regions. Professor Portaels (Belgium) has now
also identified MU in environmental samples in Africa with this PCR. She
has shown that MU is microaerophilic which may explain the association with
swamps and slow moving water.

There is very little evidence of human to human transfer of MU, and it is
likely that people become infected by contact with water or mud and plants
in or near contaminated water. It is believed that MU enters through the
skin, but the exact mechanism of exposure remains unknown. The incubation
period is very variable but appears to have a median around 8-10 weeks.
Ulcers may occur months or years after exposure. Minor trauma probably
plays a role in introducing MU through the skin in some cases.

The pathogenesis is probably toxin related. Histological sections show
necrosis extending well beyond visible bacteria and there is typically very
little inflammatory response in early lesions. Over time, a granulomatous
response more typical of mycobacterial infections develops and healing
commences.

The epidemiology of the disease in Africa (the main burden falls on
children although adults also get ulcers), the relatively low risk of
recurrence, and evidence for partial protection from BCG, all suggest that
immunity develops to MU and that a vaccine may be possible. Pam Small's
group at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories (USA) have identified a cell wall
and secreted molecule that is able to reproduce many of the toxic effects
of wild type MU. The structure will be published shortly. It is not known
yet whether it is the only toxin, whether it is immunogenic or whether its
effects can be neutralised by antibody.

There is not much evidence that the rise of Buruli ulcer in Africa is
linked to AIDS. It is currently thought that there are two parallel
epidemics, one predominantly rural (Buruli ulcer) and the other
predominantly urban (HIV). The epidemics may overlap at the edges but it
is not correct to attribute the rise of Buruli ulcer to HIV. There is
considerable clearing of rain forest in the African endemic countries.
However the cases are occurring mainly in areas with already cleared land.
It is possible that MU is being released from disturbance of upstream
regions. However, in far North Queensland there is a well-documented
focus in a relatively pristine area (Unfortunately we also log rain forest
in Australia).
In southeastern Australia we have shown that endemic regions of MU
infection can be very small (i.e. just a few square kilometres). When we
collect environmental samples in these regions we typically find MU in just
one or two sites, which leads to the concept of "point sources". In one
region (Phillip Island) we intervened with two proven point sources (a
swamp and an irrigation system) and appeared to have reduced the number of
new cases in that region. We have yet to see whether this approach will
prove useful in Africa.
