A highly contagious and deadly virus targeting wild and domestic rabbits has been detected in 2 rabbit carcasses found in the Ca√±ada de San Vicente Ecological Reserve in Ramona [California]. Wildlife officials said 2 desert cottontails tested positive for the rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2) infection on April 8 [2021].

Rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHDV2) is not related to the novel coronavirus and does not affect humans or domestic animals other than rabbits. The virus showed up in Mexico, and in New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, and Texas before it was detected in a black-tailed jackrabbit carcass found on private property near Palm Springs in May 2020 -- its 1st sighting in California. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has reported that the virus has since been detected in San Diego, Orange, and San Bernardino counties.

"Infected rabbits and jackrabbits may exhibit no symptoms leading up to their sudden death, or may suffer from fever, swelling, internal bleeding, and liver necrosis," a Fish and Wildlife statement said. "The range of susceptible species in North America is currently unknown, but all rabbit, jackrabbit, hare, and pika species are likely susceptible."

The 1st confirmed RHDV2 rabbit death in San Diego County was in Poway in June 2020. Since then, Fish and Wildlife has received 103 reports of one or more dead rabbits by phone or through their online rabbit mortality reporting system, said Deana Clifford, senior wildlife veterinarian with the department. Since May 2020, Fish and Wildlife has collected and tested 19 rabbits from various locations in San Diego County, Clifford said. Of those, the RHDV2 infection was found in 7 rabbits: 5 desert cottontails, 2 from Rancho Jamul Ecological Reserve on [18 Mar 2021], the 2 from Ramona and the 1st case from Poway; and 2 black-tailed jackrabbits from Santee on [8 Feb 2021] and Borrego Springs on [18 Mar 2021], she said.

"The public reporting system has been invaluable for allowing us to track the spread of this new disease in California rabbits," Clifford said. "Reports of dead rabbits in San Diego County declined in late summer 2000 but have recently increased again after the weather cooled down." That is consistent with other reports suggesting that transmission of the virus appears to decrease in the hottest months of the year, she said.

Bonnie Gallegos, who lives on an 8-acre [3.2 ha] property in Ramona off Magnolia Avenue, said she started noticing dead rabbits on her property about 3 weeks ago. She first called the San Diego Humane Society, but was told she needed to talk to Fish and Wildlife officials. "I was told the virus is highly contagious," said Gallegos, who has found up to 30 dead rabbits on her property and wants to get the word out about the virus. "If people are aware, they will protect their pet bunnies."

Residents who find dead rabbits on their property are advised to wear gloves or use a shovel to put the remains in a plastic bag, Fish and Wildlife officials said. Then the plastic bag should be sealed and placed in another plastic bag, which should be sprayed with disinfectant.

Pets, scavengers, and other animals can spread the virus on their feet or fur, so officials have released the following guidelines:
- House rabbits should remain inside to minimize potential contact; if outside, they should be kept off the ground.
- Any unusual illness or sudden rabbit deaths should be reported to your veterinarian immediately.
- The virus is highly contagious, and can be spread by direct contact with infected animals, their urine and feces, and also through contaminated objects or even insects. Wash hands thoroughly before and after handling rabbits and leave shoes outside.
- Know your hay/feed sources and if they are near areas affected by the outbreak.
- Keep dogs on a leash when outside so they don't interact with wild rabbits; wash their paws before they come inside. Keep dogs and rabbits in separate areas of your home.

Clifford said her department is monitoring rabbits in several locations to learn how the virus impacts populations of predators that depend on rabbits, like golden eagles and bobcats. "Once RHDV2 has become re-established in wild rabbit populations, eradication is not possible because the virus can persist in the environment for months and has multiple ways it can be transmitted between rabbits," she said.

A vaccine available in Europe can protect rabbits from the disease, but it's not approved for widespread use in the US. However, the California Department of Food and Agriculture is allowing licensed veterinarians in California to import the vaccine from Europe, Clifford said.

[In the 1980s, the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) populations were devastated by a virus that caused an extremely lethal and highly contagious disease, rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD). The 1st outbreak of this new disease was reported in 1984 in the Jiangsu Province of China within a group of commercially-bred Angora rabbits imported from Germany. As the virus spread worldwide, naturally occurring RHD outbreaks were reported in geographically distant regions, such as Cuba, Uruguay and Reunion Island.

RHD is a highly pathogenic lagovirus endemic in Europe and Australasian populations of the European rabbit, _Oryctolagus cuniculus_. It has also caused several unexplained disease outbreaks in domestic European rabbits in North America.

In North America, there are 21 species of wild lagomorphs, 11 cottontail rabbits (_Sylvilagus_ spp.), 8 jackrabbits (_Lepus_ spp.) and 2 pikas (_Ochotona_ spp.). Of these, at least xx species have been found infected by RHDV, including the eastern cottontail (_Sylvilagus floridanus_), the desert cottontail (_S. audubonii_), the mountain cottontail (_S. nuttallii_), the black-tailed jackrabbit (_Lepus californicus_), and the antelope jackrabbit (_Lepus alleni_). There are concerns that RHDV infection could significantly adversely affect these already endangered North American species of lagomorphs.

RHD is characterised by high morbidity and high mortality (70-90%) in European rabbits, and spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission. Infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival or oral routes.

Transmission of RHD is facilitated by the high stability of the virus in the environment. Lesions are primary liver necrosis and a massive disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in all organs and tissues. The most severe lesions are in the liver, trachea and lungs.

In 2010, a new genotype of RHD (RHD-2) emerged and where it propagated it replaced the original strain. This new variant causes lethal infections also in juvenile (<2 months old) and RHD vaccinated rabbits. After its 1st detection in France, RHD-2 spread rapidly and infections were reported in several European countries, North America, the Middle East, and Australia. - Mod.PMB
