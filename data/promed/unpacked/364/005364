[1] USA: nurse with exposure in Sierra Leone medevaced to NIH

Patient with exposure in Sierra Leone to Ebola arrives at NIH Clinical Center
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A patient with exposure to the Ebola virus while in Sierra Leone has arrived safely at the NIH Clinical Center [on Thu 11 Dec 2014] for observation and to enroll in a clinical protocol. The patient was transferred from overseas via private charter medevac in isolation and admitted to the NIH Clinical Center at approximately 12:42pm EST. The patient is an American nurse who was volunteering services in an Ebola treatment unit in Sierra Leone.

Out of an abundance of caution, the patient has been admitted to the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center's special clinical studies unit [in Bethesda, Maryland] that is specifically designed to provide high-level isolation capabilities and is staffed by infectious diseases and critical care specialists. The unit staff is trained in strict infection control practices optimized to prevent spread of potentially transmissible agents such as Ebola.

Ebola vaccine trial suspended for checks after joint pains
----------------------------------------------------------
A clinical trial of an Ebola vaccine has been suspended in all 59 volunteers in Geneva a week early "as a measure of precaution" after 4 volunteers complained of joint pains in hands and feet, the University of Geneva hospital said. "They are all fine and being monitored regularly by the medical team leading the study," it said on Thu 11 Dec 2014. The human safety trials of the vaccine being developed by the pharmaceutical firms Merck and NewLink are scheduled to resume on 5 Jan 2015 in up to 15 volunteers, after checks to ensure that the joint pain symptoms were "benign and temporary", the hospital added.

Separately Gavi, the global vaccines alliance, has committed up to USD 300m (GBP 192m) to buy Ebola vaccines and is ready to begin procurement as soon as the WHO recommends one for use, the alliance said on Thu [11 Dec 2014]. Up to an additional USD 90m could also be used to support countries to introduce the vaccines and to rebuild their health systems, it added.... -- more

[3] UK: London prevention plans

London Assembly reassured over plans for Ebola by Mayor
-------------------------------------------------------
On Thu 11 Dec 2014, Public Health England and the Mayor's Chief of Staff appeared before the Greater London Authority (GLA) Oversight Committee to be questioned about pan-London resilience arrangements, in the event of an Ebola virus incident in London.

Dr Deborah Turbitt -- Deputy Regional Director for Health Protection, Public Health England -- told the committee that it was very unlikely there would be more than 2 or 3 cases arriving in London. She said, "Screening has been in place for some time now at Heathrow [airport] and other ports of entry. This involves the UK Border Force identifying arrivals from at-risk countries and directing them to the screening teams, who will ask about their activities in the country of origin, take their temperature, give advice on what to watch for over the next 3 days and explain how to safely access the health system here. The instruction given to health care workers for the initial assessment is 'Talk -- don't touch'."

Sir Edward Lister -- Chief of Staff, GLA -- said, "We are confident robust arrangements are in place. The Mayor's Advisory Group met twice in October [2014] to discuss the plans and reassurances were given. The role of the Mayor in the event of an incident is 3-fold -- to communicate with and be the voice for London, to share information across all the organisations involved and to support the lead government agencies, such as Public Health England."

Len Duvall -- Chair of the GLA Oversight Committee -- said, "It is clear the Mayor has assured himself that checks and systems are in place to deal with the issue, should it arise. Ebola is difficult to catch, the risk of onward transmission is also extremely low and medical staff are trained to assess and isolate any suspected cases. Obviously we hope the plans will not be needed but we are reassured the issue is being taken seriously and the GLA is ready to act, should it be necessary."
