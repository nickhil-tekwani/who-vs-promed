The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today [18 Jan 2008] announced
that New Era Canning Company, New Era, MI, is expanding its product
recall because of potential _Clostridium botulinum_ contamination to
all canned green beans and garbanzo beans distributed by the company
nationwide over the last 5 years. _C. botulinum_ can cause botulism,
a serious and sometimes life-threatening condition. The affected cans
are large institutional-sized containers, weighing approximately 6 1/2 pounds.

To date, no illnesses have been reported to the FDA; however,
consumers should not consume these products, even if they appear to
be normal, because of the potential serious risk to health. Consumers
who have the affected products or who have used them in recipes
should immediately throw the cans and food away.

New Era took this voluntary action in the interest of public health
in accordance with the FDA's recall request. The company is taking
immediate action to retrieve all inventories of the products
throughout the distribution chain, including consumers' homes,
nursing homes, schools, warehouses, restaurants, retail stores,
health care facilities, and other facilities.

For specific brands and codes of green beans and garbanzo beans that
are subject to this recall, consumers and retailers can access this
information at the following link:
<http://www.fda.gov/oc/opacom/hottopics/newera.html>. Please note
that New Era produces canned products under other brand names and
labels. Therefore, the recalled products may not necessarily be
labeled with New Era's name. Also, the cans may bear a variety of
product codes or no codes at all. Regardless of brand name or label,
or the presence or absence of a code, the recalled cans should not be
opened or used, and should be disposed of as described below.
Consumers who are not sure if a product is subject to the recall
should still throw it out as a precaution.

Any food that may contain the recalled canned beans should be
disposed of carefully. Even tiny amounts of the C. botulinum toxin
can cause serious illness when ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through
the eye or a break in the skin. Skin contact should be avoided as
much as possible, and hands should be washed immediately after
handling the food.

When disposing of these products, double-bag the cans in plastic
bags. Make sure the bags are tightly closed, then place in a trash
receptacle for non-recyclable trash outside of the home. Restaurants
and institutions should ensure that such products are only placed in
locked receptacles that are not accessible to the public. Additional
instructions for safe disposal may be found at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/botulism_g.htm>. Anyone
with questions may call the FDA at 1-888-SAFEFOOD.

The FDA and the Michigan Department of Agriculture launched a joint
investigation of New Era's processing plant. This investigation
resulted in the identification of _C. botulinum_ contamination in
several lots of canned green beans and one lot of garbanzo beans, the
identification of serious food violations, and this expanded recall.
Original findings of this investigation resulted in the company
voluntarily recalling green beans in December 2007
(<http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2007/NEW01764.html>), and green
beans, Mexican-style chili beans, and dark red kidney beans in January 2008
(<http://www.fda.gov/oc/po/firmrecalls/newera01_08.html>).

The FDA initiated the inspection at New Era, along with inspections
of other low acid canned food (LACF) manufacturers, following 4 cases
of botulism in consumers who had consumed canned hot dog chili sauce
in the summer of 2007. In light of these botulism cases, FDA
increased its inspection efforts to assure that manufacturers of all
types of LACF products are adhering to applicable FDA requirements.
These actions illustrate the need for companies to operate under
adequate preventive control systems.

As part of the ongoing investigation, the FDA issued an Order of Need
for Emergency Permit to New Era. This order prohibits the manufacture
and shipment of the company's low acid canned foods across state
lines until they demonstrate to the FDA's satisfaction that the
products are safe. In addition, the Michigan Department of
Agriculture, under its state authority, has embargoed New Era's
entire inventory of low acid canned products contained in the
company's warehouses in Michigan. As a result, New Era is not
currently distributing any products.

[It is now stated that the inspections which led to the recall were
precipitated by the 2007 cluster of chili sauce-associated botulism
which expanded to other products produced at the same plant. The
expansion of this recall now includes all products produced as long
as 5 years ago not just certain lots.

Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such
recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated
with the food. Most of the food recalls are related to defective
preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result
in the germination of viable spores of _C. botulinum_. However,
during the original part of this recall, it was stated that the
organism was indeed identified. - Mod.LL]
