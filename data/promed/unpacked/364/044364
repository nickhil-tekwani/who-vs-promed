[1] Gastrointestinal Complications in Critically ill COVID-19 Patients

Background
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) appears to have significant extrapulmonary complications affecting multiple organ systems.1-3 Critically ill patients with COVID-19 often develop gastrointestinal complications during their hospital stay, including bowel ischemia, transaminitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, pancreatitis, Ogilvie syndrome, and severe ileus. Whether the high incidence of gastrointestinal complications is a manifestation of critical illness in general or is specific to COVID-19 remains unclear. We compared the incidence of gastrointestinal complications of critically ill patients with COVID-19-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) vs comparably ill patients with non-COVID-19 ARDS using propensity score analysis.

Methods
All patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction who were intubated and admitted to one of 13 (preexistent and surge) intensive care units (ICUs) of the Massachusetts General Hospital between 13 Mar 2020, and 7 May 2020 were included then matched to a cohort of patients admitted between 2018 and 2019 and meeting the Berlin criteria for ARDS. No changes occurred in the ICU staffing models or protocols of care of ARDS during the study period. Propensity score matching was performed adjusting for demographics (e.g. age, sex, body mass index, smoking status), comorbidities (e.g. chronic lung/kidney disease, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes), and severity of illness on ICU admission (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score). We examined in both groups the following gastrointestinal complications: transaminitis, ileus, Ogilvie syndrome, and mesenteric ischemia.

Wilcoxon rank sum, Pearson x2, and Fisher exact tests were used, as appropriate. To determine whether differences in the duration of illness between groups might contribute, incidence rate ratios and Kaplan-Meier curves looking at time to development of the complication from hospital admission were calculated. All tests were 2-tailed; statistical significance was defined as P less than .05. Statistical analyses were performed on Stata version 15.0 (StataCorp LP). The Mass General Brigham Institutional Review Board ruled this study exempt including a waiver of informed consent.

Results
A total of 486 patients with ARDS met eligibility criteria, of which 244 had non-COVID-19 ARDS and 242 had COVID-19 ARDS. This report includes data from 141 patients with COVID-19 (58%) whose overall gastrointestinal complications have been previously described. The median age of patients was 60.5 years (interquartile range, 48-71) and 62 years (interquartile range, 53-73.5) for patients with and without COVID-19, respectively, and the percentage of males was 66.5% and 54.9%, respectively.

92 patients with COVID-19 and ARDS were propensity score matched to 92 patients with non-COVID-19 ARDS (Table). The etiologies for ARDS among the non-COVID-19-matched cohort were bacterial pneumonia (60%), aspiration (27%), influenza (7%), respiratory syncytial virus infection (2%), and _Pneumocystis jiroveci_ pneumonia (2%). Patients with COVID-19 were more likely to develop gastrointestinal complications compared with those without COVID-19 (74% vs 37%; P  less than 0 .001; incidence rate ratio, 2.33 [95% CI, 1.52-3.63]). The difference in incidence was more evident after the 3rd day of critical illness (Figure in original text). Specifically, patients with COVID-19 developed more transaminitis (55% vs 27%; P  less than  0.001), severe ileus (48% vs 22%; P less than  0.001), and bowel ischemia (4% vs 0%; P = 0.04). Three of the 4 patients with COVID-19 and bowel ischemia were taken to the operating room and had intraoperative findings consistent with COVID-19 bowel as previously described in different patients. Pathology findings demonstrated fibrin thrombi in the microvasculature underlying areas of necrosis.

Discussion
This study found a higher rate of gastrointestinal complications, including mesenteric ischemia, in critically ill patients with COVID-19 compared with propensity score-matched patients without COVID-19, suggesting a distinct phenotype for COVID-19 compared with conventional ARDS. High expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors along the epithelial lining of the gut that act as host-cell receptors for SARS-CoV-2 could explain involvement of abdominal organs. Higher opioid requirements and COVID-19-induced coagulopathy may also explain the disproportionately high rate of ileus and ischemic bowel disease. Differences in duration of illness did not seem to explain the differences in gastrointestinal complications. Limitations of this study include the single center and the unavailability of inflammatory markers to use for matching. Further translational studies are warranted to examine the pathophysiology of these findings.

[This study highlights the impact of serious SARS-CoV2 infection on post infection and recovery. Additional data will be important to see whether this happens uniformly with the virus infection, or whether other factors may be implicated. - Mod.UBA]

[2] Loss of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Test Antibodies in mild cases
Date: 23 Sep 2020

The results reported in the letter by Ibarrondo et al. (10 Sep 2020) regarding the rapid decay of anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in patients who had recovered from Covid-19 are in contrast to our findings and those of other research groups, such as Wang et al. from China. In their study, Wang et al. showed that IgG responses were detected in most patients with either severe disease or mild disease at 9 days after the onset of infection, and the IgG levels remained high throughout the study (35 to 40 days). These findings are in accordance with those from our investigation of the longitudinal profile of IgA and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in samples of convalescent plasma obtained from 151 donors. We found that the IgA levels remained high until 50 to 60 days after the onset of symptoms and that the IgG levels remained elevated, with only a slight decrease, at 120 days after the onset of symptoms. Therefore, we need more data regarding the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from different research groups to understand the human antibody response against this disease.

[Increasing, though still rare, reports of reinfection of individuals with SARS-CoV2 are occurring and certainly reinfection with other coronaviruses is known to occur. Persistence of antibody is one factor in duration of protective immunity and it is the subject of ongoing study as cases of COVID-19 have been known for less than a year. Other factors including cell-mediated immunity, are also operative and even less well understood. - Mod.LM]

[The USA, India, and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India now in the 2nd position followed by Brazil. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (89 010), followed by the USA (43 206) and Brazil (25 536) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (54.5%) and 50.6% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. As the daily reports from each of the 3 countries have been dropping, other countries are reporting more newly confirmed cases. A global total of 5306 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (24-25 Sep 2020).

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include India, USA, Brazil, Spain (0), France (14 412), Argentina (11 249), Israel (9201), Colombia (7721), Russia (7523), UK (6042), Peru (5558), and Mexico (5401); 36 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours. Eight of the top 20 countries reporting the highest daily newly confirmed cases are from the European region and 6 were from the Americas region (unchanged from yesterday [25 Sep 2020]).

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase in case counts by 1.1%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 0.40%.

Impression: While the global 7-day averages appear to have plateaued, when one looks at the country-by-country figures, the 3 major countries -- the USA, India and Brazil -- have decreased their daily newly confirmed cases, but other countries have increased transmission, especially in Europe and the Americas. - Mod.UBA]
