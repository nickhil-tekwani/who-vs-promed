WEIGHT LOSS PRODUCT ADVISORY - USA

On 9 Jul 2014, the FDA notified consumers not to purchase or use certain weight loss products including:

- Mix Fruit Slimming,
- Lingzhi Cleansed Slim Tea,
- 24 Ince,
- Lipo 8 Burn Slim Capsules,
- Sliming [sic.] Diet By Pretty White, and
- Trim-Fast Slimming Softgel.

FDA's reason for the notification is that laboratory analysis revealed that these products contain sibutramine, and Mix Fruit Slimming contains phenolphthalein.

Sibutramine can significantly increase blood pressure and/or pulse rate and can pose a significant risk for patients with a history of arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, stroke, or congestive heart failure. Moreover, it can interact in life-threatening ways with other drugs that patients are taking.

Phenolphthalein poses a cancer-causing risk, according to studies.

As the agency notes "The FDA is advising consumers not to purchase or use these products."

[Sibutramine is no longer available in the U.S., as the manufacturer has decided to stop producing it based on information from a recent clinical study. In this study, people taking sibutramine had an increased risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke.

***If you are currently taking sibutramine, you should stop taking this medication and call your doctor to discuss switching to another treatment for weight loss or maintenance of weight loss.***

Sibutramine is used in combination with a reduced calorie diet and exercise to help people who are overweight lose weight and maintain their weight loss. Sibutramine is in a class of medications called appetite suppressants. It works by acting on appetite control centers in the brain to decrease appetite.

Phenolphthalein is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in experimental animals.

The routes of human exposure to phenolphthalein are ingestion, dermal contact, and inhalation of contaminated air originating from process units manufacturing the compound (HSDB 2009). The general population has been exposed to phenolphthalein through its common use as an over-the-counter drug, particularly as a laxative. The typical oral dose of phenolphthalein as an over-the-counter laxative was 30-200 mg for adults and children aged 12 years or older; the recommended dose was not to exceed 270 mg. Children's doses were 15 to 30 mg for children aged 2 to 5 years and 30 to 60 mg for children aged 6 to 11 years (IARC 2000). Phenolphthalein also has been found as an undeclared drug in several weight-loss products that are marketed as dietary supplements (FDA 2009).
