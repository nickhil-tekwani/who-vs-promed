Viet Nam: a brief summary of recent analyses of avian influenza H5N1
viruses from humans
-----------------------------------------------
Since 31 Jan 2005, WHO has received more than 90 clinical specimens sampled
between 24 Dec 2004 and 29 Jan 2005 from confirmed and suspected H5N1 human
cases in Viet Nam. Antigenic and genetic analyses are being conducted in
the WHO Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on Influenza and
the WHO H5 Reference Laboratory in the National Institute of Infectious
Diseases, Japan. So far, 9 viruses have been isolated from specimens
collected from southern Viet Nam.
Results show that:
(1) These viruses belong to group Z and are genetically highly similar to
the viruses isolated in 2004, including A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and
A/Vietnam/1203/2004, which are the prototype vaccine strains recommended by
WHO for pandemic influenza vaccine production.
(2) Except for one virus, all the rest are antigenically closely related to
A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and A/Vietnam/1203/2004.
(3) At the receptor recognition site, there appears [to be] an avian
receptor preference.
The conclusions so far:
(1) Very little mutation has been observed since last year [2004].
(2) There is no need to change the prototype pandemic vaccine strain
selected by WHO last year [2004].
(3) Genetically, the viruses continue to show resistance to amantadine.

Viet Nam: grandfather [asymptomatic] of avian influenza patients also infected
-----------------------------------------------
The grandfather of 2 siblings infected with avian influenza [virus] in Viet
Nam has also contracted the virus but has shown no symptoms of the disease
that has killed 46 people in the region. Health authorities suspect that
the 3 family members, from northern Thai Binh province, caught the virus
after eating an infected goose slaughtered by the grandfather a month ago
[February 2005], and there was no immediate indication that they had
infected one another.
Test results at the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology in Hanoi
showed that the 80-year-old man was infected with the H5N1 avian influenza
virus. The man remains in good health at his home without any of the
disease's typical symptoms of high fever and breathing difficulties. His
21-year-old grandson and 14-year-old granddaughter are hospitalized in
Hanoi. None of the remaining 12 family members have tested positive for the
virus. Earlier this week [2nd week March 2005], Viet Nam reported that a
26-year-old male nurse, who cared for the grandson, had also been infected
by avian influenza virus, but health officials said it was likely he
contracted the disease outside the hospital. Health authorities suspect a
meal of goose the family had on 8 Feb 2005 was the source of the
infections. However, they ate chickens and geese several times during the
week-long Lunar New Year festival last month [February 2005].
Several cases in Viet Nam and Thailand have involved family clusters, where
several relatives were infected at the same time, though there has been no
evidence that the virus has mutated into a form easily transmitted by
people. Health officials warn that, when that happens, the virus could
spark a global pandemic that kills millions. So far, most human infections
have been traced to contact with sick poultry.
Viet Nam has had a total of 33 deaths from the deadly disease, 13 of them
in the latest outbreak which began last December [2004]. A woman in
Cambodia also died this year [2005] in a Vietnamese hospital. 12 people
have died in Thailand.
The grandfather has been given anti-viral drugs and asked to limit his
contact with other people, said Dao Trong Bich, Deputy Director of the
medical center in Thai Thuy District where the family lives. The man's
family had raised chickens, one of which died during Tet. The man then gave
the 3 remaining chickens to his daughter, the mother of the 21-year-old man
and his 14-year-old sister.

Viet Nam: another asymptomatic case of avian influenza H5N1 virus infection
-----------------------------------------------
A 68-year-old widow from Viet Nam's northern Thai Binh province, wife of an
avian influenza patient, has just been confirmed to have contracted avian
influenza virus H5N1, raising the total [number of infections in the
country since late December 2004] to 24, a local health official told
Xinhua on Wed 9 Mar 2005.
"According to testing by the National Hygiene and Epidemiology Institute
today [Wed 9 Mar 2005], specimens from the woman from Kien Xuong district
tested positive for H5N1 virus. She had slaughtered a chicken for a meal on
the 3rd day of the Lunar New Year Festival (early February 2005)," said
Pham Gia Lai, deputy director of the Thai Binh Health Department. The
woman, who is now in good health in her home town, will receive treatment
with the anti-viral drug Tamiflu, he said.
The woman's 69-year-old husband developed symptoms of avian influenza on 19
Feb 2005, was admitted to the Thai Binh Hospital on the same day, and died
on 23 Feb 2005. Testing by the institute in the capital city of Hanoi
indicated that he was a bird flu victim.

Viet Nam: relatives have avian influenza but no symptoms
-----------------------------------------------
2 elderly Vietnamese relatives of people who died of avian influenza have
tested positive for the [H5N1] virus despite showing no symptoms, health
officials say. Both lived in the northern province of Thai Binh, where a
cluster of cases is causing great concern about the possibility of
human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 virus, which experts fear could
mutate into a form which could cause a pandemic. "We are aware of these
cases, and we are investigating this further," a World Health Organization
spokeswoman said on Wednesday [9 Mar 2005].
For one of the symptom-free carriers of the virus, a 61-year-old woman, the
only link established to the disease was her husband, who died of bird flu
on 24 Feb 2005. "The old lady is totally healthy," said an official at the
health clinic of her village in Quyet Tien commune. "She took care of her
husband when he was sick. Other than that, she said she ate only pork, and
all 4 chickens raised in her house tested negative for avian influenza."
The other, the 81-year-old grandfather of a brother and sister who
contracted the disease, drank raw duck blood during the Tet Lunar New Year
festivities last month [February 2005], health officials in his village
said. "It is really strange that he carried the virus for a month and did
not get sick," said one health official, in the Thuy Luong commune of Thai
Thuy district, of a virus which usually takes 3 to 10 days to show symptoms.
However, there was no immediate confirmation from experts that the old man
had indeed been carrying the H5N1 virus for nearly a month without showing
symptoms, although his 21-year-old grandson caught it after drinking raw
duck blood at Tet. The young man's 14-year-old sister was also infected
after coming into contact with sick chickens, and health officials
confirmed this week [2nd week March 2005] that a nurse who tended the
grandson had caught bird flu, which has killed 47 people in Asia.
Top medical officials said there was evidence the 26-year-old male nurse
lived in an area where the H5N1 virus had struck poultry and that he had
eaten chicken. But they said the focus of their investigation into the case
was the possibility he had caught it directly from his patient.
What worries the experts most is the possibility of the virus mutating into
a form which could pass easily between humans and set off a pandemic in a
world without immunity to it, and kill millions. So far, there has been no
evidence that mutation has occurred, and the only previous probable case of
human-to-human transmission occurred in Thailand, where a mother died after
cradling her sick daughter in her arms for hours.
The male nurse, being treated in a Hanoi hospital with a high fever, a
symptom of the H5N1 strain which has killed more than 70 percent of the
people known to have caught it, had provided bed care to the grandson.
The H5N1 virus has killed 34 Vietnamese, 12 Thais and a Cambodian since it
swept across large parts of Asia at the end of 2003. It has recurred
several times, despite the slaughter of millions of poultry, and has spread
across about half of Viet Nam since the latest outbreak began in the Mekong
Delta of Southern Viet Nam. It sprang up again around the same time in
Thailand, where the government said it had spread to 19 of the country's 76
provinces but had not infected any more people.

[There are some minor contradictions within these reports concerning the
extent of exposure to diseased birds, or the consumption of poultry meat
and products, but it is clear that asymptomatic infection of humans by
avian influenza H5N1 virus does occur. There is an increasing need for
seroprevalence studies of the general population to establish the frequency
of asymptomatic infection in the absence of association with symptomatic
cases of avian influenza virus infection. So far, the few clusters of cases
observed involve family members predominantly and can be explained by
direct infection from diseased birds rather than by person-to-person
transmission. Dr Zhang's analyses of the genome sequences of clinical
isolates, although relating to viruses collected at an earlier date in
southern Viet Nam, do not indicate that the H5N1 virus is undergoing the
rapid or progressive mutational change that might herald the appearance of
a virus capable of spreading in the human population without the
intervention of poultry. The continued prevalence of human cases of avian
influenza in Viet Nam, and not elsewhere in East Asia, might indicate that
there are social and/or genetic factors peculiar to the Vietnamese
population that remain to evaluated. - Mod.CP]
