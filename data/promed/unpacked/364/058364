The Townsend Farms hepatitis A outbreak associated with berries sold at Costco has sickened 113 people, 5 of whom are under 18, according to a [21 Jun 2013] update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The 113 confirmed cases are in the following 7 states: Arizona (15), California (57), Colorado (23), Hawaii (5), New Mexico (5), Nevada (5), and Utah (3). 50 people have been hospitalized. The case patients range in age from 2 to 84, although most are between the ages of 40 and 64. About 59 percent of the case patients are female.

Based on information from interviews with patients, onset of illness dates ranged from 31 Mar 2013 to 13 Jun 2013. All patients who reported eating the berries in question -- Townsend Farms Organic Antioxidant Blend, said they purchased it from Costco stores. But the product was also sold under the name Harris Teeter Organics Antioxidant Berry Blend at Harris Teeter stores. At this time, no cases have been identified with berries purchased at Harris Teeter stores. Townsend and Harris Teeter both issued recalls and Costco notified customers.

An investigation by state and local health departments, the CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is ongoing. The FDA is inspecting the processing facilities of Townsend Farms of Fairview, Oregon; has finalized a protocol to test berries for the hepatitis A virus (HAV), and is testing samples related to the outbreak for the presence of HAV.

[Since the previous report on 17 Jun 2013, the number of diagnosed cases has increased from 106 to 133, and the number of hospitalisations from 46 to 50.

According to the World Health Organisation the incubation period of hepatitis A is usually 14-28 days. Symptoms of hepatitis A range from mild to severe, and can include fever, malaise, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal discomfort, dark-coloured urine, and jaundice. Adults have signs and symptoms of illness more often than children, and the severity of disease and mortality increase in older age groups. Infected children under 6 years of age do not usually experience noticeable symptoms, and only 10 percent develop jaundice. Among older children and adults, infection usually causes more severe symptoms, with jaundice occurring in more than 70 percent of cases (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs328/en/index.html) - Mod.CP
