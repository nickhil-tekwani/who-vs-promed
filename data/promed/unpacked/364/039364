According to the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division (EDCD), a total of 5 patients have been found to have contracted chikungunya virus (CHIKV) this year [2017].

Of these, 3 (2 from Chitwan and one from Syangja districts) died of this viral disease (60 percent fatality rate). This is the 1st reported death ever due to CHIKV in Nepal.

Still, many physicians do not include CHIKV in their differential diagnosis in Nepal. Therefore, it can be assumed that the true number of CHIKV cases is likely to be much higher than what EDCD has reported. Chikungunya virus was 1st reported in 2013 in Nepal [1].

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Pun for informing us about these 3 fatal cases from Chitwan and Syangja districts in Nepal.

An important observation by Dr Pun is that the symptoms of chikungunya and dengue virus infections (and Zika virus infections also), especially early on, are similar clinically; laboratory confirmation is necessary. It seems very reasonable that chikungunya virus infections are significantly underreported.

Chikungunya is a viral disease transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes. It causes fever and severe joint pain. Other symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can vary in duration. The disease shares some clinical signs with dengue and Zika and can be misdiagnosed in areas where they are common. The proximity of mosquito breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for chikungunya.

The disease mostly occurs in Africa, Asia and the Indian subcontinent. The risk of death is around one in 1000 (Caglioti, C; Lalle, E; Castilletti, C; Carletti, F; Capobianchi, MR; Bordi, L (July 2013). "Chikungunya virus infection: an overview." The new microbiologica. 36 (3): 211-27. PMID 23912863>). The very young, old, and those with other health problems are at risk of more severe disease (Chikungunya Virus Symptoms, Diagnosis, & Treatment." CDC. 6 Apr 2016).

The best means of prevention is overall mosquito control and the avoidance of bites in areas where the disease is common. This may be partly achieved by decreasing mosquitoes' access to water and with the use of insect repellent and mosquito nets. There is no vaccine and no specific treatment as of 2016 (Chikungunya Fact sheet." WHO. April 2016). Recommendations include rest, fluids, and medications to help with fever and joint pain.

Although chikungunya usually leads to fever and severe pain, a new study shows it may also lead to inflammation in the brain, and even death in some people. In the study, researchers looked at an epidemic of the virus on Reunion Island, in the Indian Ocean near Madagascar, that lasted from 2005 to 2006 and sickened 300 000 people. As a result of their infections, 24 people developed encephalitis, which is inflammation of the brain, and 4 of these people died from their infection. Encephalitis from the chikungunya virus was most common among babies younger than one year and people ages 65 and older https://www.livescience.com/52921-chikungunya-virus-encephalitis-death.html. However, the above report of chikungunya fatal cases does not provide epidemiological data on them. - Mod.UBA
