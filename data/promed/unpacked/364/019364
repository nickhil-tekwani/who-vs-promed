Sharp rise in waterborne diseases in Kochi district of Kerala state
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The waterborne communicable disease hepatitis A that prevailed during
the monsoon [season] almost like an epidemic had created most of the
problems for the district Health department during the year.

Compared to last year when only 36 cases of hepatitis A were reported,
this year (as of 8 Dec 2011) the number of confirmed cases were 237,
with another 726 cases reported as suspected, making it about a
thousand cases of jaundice. There were also 5 deaths, which the Health
authorities categorised as death due to complications of other
diseases, as hepatitis A is usually not found to be the cause of
death.

The number of jaundice cases did not stop with hepatitis A. 3 other
types of hepatitis [caused by either hepatitis B, C or E virus] were
also reported this year. In fact, 24 cases of confirmed and 32
suspected of hepatitis B virus infection were found in the district; 2
deaths were also reported. A [separate] expert panel is investigating
the cases of hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus infections which are
both transmitted through blood transfusion and unprotected sexual
contact.

There have also been 2 cases of hepatitis C virus infection, which
takes the same route of transmission as hepatitis B, and one case of
hepatitis E (transmitted by the same route as hepatitis A).

Controlling the hepatitis outbreak took some time as the rains
continued for a long time. The people's personal hygiene, lack of
cleanliness, low quality of water used in households and street foods
in certain areas, the accumulating solid waste on the streets and lack
of precaution by the people working in risk areas became some of the
most important factors that promoted the spread jaundice [i.e.,
hepatitis A virus infection].

Other water-borne disease that were reported at high levels this year
were leptospirosis, typhoid, and the vector-borne dengue fever and
malaria. In spite of a surge in these water-borne diseases, common
water-borne diseases which are categorised as diarrhoeal diseases were
comparatively less this year at 19 066 cases against 25 448 cases last
year. There were only 2 cases of influenza A/H1N1 reported this year
compared to 223 cases last year.

[Hepatitis A is a viral liver disease that can cause mild to severe
illness. The disease is closely associated with poor sanitation and a
lack of personal hygiene habits. The symptoms of hepatitis A range
from mild to severe, and can include fever, malaise, loss of appetite,
diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal discomfort, dark-colored urine and
jaundice. Recovery from symptoms following infection may be slow and
take several weeks or months. Hepatitis A vaccine is available for use
where improvements in sanitation and provision of clean water are
challenging.

Kochi (city and district) is part of the district of Ernakulam in the
Indian state of Kerala. It can be located in the HealthMap interactive
