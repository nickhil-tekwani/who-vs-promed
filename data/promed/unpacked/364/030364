Influenza update - 310 (based on data up to 18 Feb 2018)
--------------------------------------------------------
Information in this report is categorized by influenza transmission zones, which are geographical groups of countries, areas or territories with similar influenza transmission patterns.

Summary
-------
Influenza activity remained high in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere while in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere activity was at inter-seasonal levels. Worldwide, influenza A and influenza B accounted for a similar proportion of influenza detections.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 99 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 5 Feb 2018 to 18 Feb 2018 (data as of 2 Mar 2018 03:41:07 UTC). The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested 281 243 specimens during that time period, of which 90 570 (32.2 percent) were positive for influenza viruses, of which 44 502 (49.1 percent) were typed as influenza A, and 46 068 (50.9 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 7773 (58.2 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 5574 (41.8 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 5835 (94.4 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 346 (5.6 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

[2] Kenya (Laikipia county): alert

The Laikipia county health officials have confirmed the presence of the H1N1 prototype 9 influenza virus among some patients who are being treated of severe flu. This is after samples taken from patients at the Nanyuki Teaching and Referral Hospital were confirmed to have the virus. Health facilities in the region and the neighbouring areas have now been put on a high alert.

Laikipia County Director of Health and Sanitation Dr Donald Moghoi said that in the last 2 weeks patients have been seeking services with high fever, dry cough, sore throat, and general body weakness which are signs of the virus. Moghoi however said that some cases are mild and once treated, patients are allowed to go home noting that they suspected the H1N1 prototype 9 virus and took samples to the government laboratories and the results were affirmative from 2 of them.

He however noted that there was no need for panic as the hospitals and all health facilities are ready to deal with any eventualities. He urged those with such symptoms to go for medical check-up noting that there was enough medication to control and take care of the patients.

He noted that the disease affects all people across the board but can be severe among children and the aged because of a poor immune system. The hospital is treating up to 60 cases a day adding that because the disease is spread through air and body contact, people should be wary of coughing etiquette, washing hands after greetings among other general hygiene.

The ministry is also concerned with the spread of the flu in schools and Moghoi confirmed that health officers will be going to the institutions to create awareness among the teachers and students.

Panic engulfed Nanyuki town after a baby died after the deadly swine flu [influenza A(H1N1)] virus was reported in the area. Laikipia health official Donald Mogoi confirmed the results from the National Health Laboratory revealed the presence of the deadly virus. The 5-year-old boy died at the Nanyuki Cottage Hospital and was being treated for pneumonia according to his father.

[Influenza A(H1N1)] is a respiratory disease caused by influenza viruses that infect the respiratory tract and result in a barking cough, decreased appetite, nasal secretions, and listless behavior.

The virus can be transmitted to humans and is transmitted from person to person by inhalation or ingestion of droplets containing virus from people sneezing or coughing. After early outbreaks in North America in April 2009 the new influenza virus spread rapidly around the world.

By the time WHO declared a pandemic in June 2009, a total of 74 countries and territories had reported laboratory confirmed infections.

["In Kenya, a tropical country, influenza is present throughout but with exacerbations at some times of the year. Influenza incidence tends to be highest in Kenya during a broad wave that mostly corresponds with the southern hemisphere winter, with peaks during wet months: March-April, October-November, and the cold month of July. On the other hand, influenza in temperate countries comes in epidemics during the winter seasons."

"Kenya has a working national epidemio-surveillance network comprising of both public and private professionals and other stakeholders. The response plan focuses on the following: epidemiological surveillance; information, education, communication and social mobilization; case management; laboratory and research; infection prevention and control; coordination and resource mobilization; human resource mobilization and additional emergency staff training."
