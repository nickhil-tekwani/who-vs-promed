Preliminary tests carried out by the Health Protection Agency (HPA)
have identified the toxin that causes botulism from a used jar of Loyd
Grossman Korma sauce. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is advising
consumers who have purchased the particular batch of the product to
dispose of it and not to consume it. A full recall of this product
batch has been issued, and the sauce is being removed from shop
shelves.

This follows 2 cases of botulism in one family in Scotland where the
contaminated jar of sauce was discovered. No further cases have been
identified to date. There is no evidence to suggest that the samples
taken from the jar for testing could have been separately contaminated
from another source. Further tests on this and from another unused jar
of the korma sauce taken from the home of the patients are underway.

The affected batch is: 350g jars of Loyd Grossman Korma sauce with a
best before date of February 2013. The sauce has a batch code of:
1218R 07:21.

Health professionals across the UK have been made aware of the
suspected cases and advised to look out for people of all ages with
possible symptoms. The HPA is working with the Scottish authorities
and the Food Standards Agency on the investigation.

Botulism is rare in the UK, as there have only been 33 recorded cases
of foodborne botulism in England and Wales since 1989, with 27 of
these linked to a single outbreak.

Dr Kathie Grant, a botulinum toxin expert at the HPA, said: "Cases of
botulism are thankfully very rare in the UK, although it can be a very
serious infection in those that are affected. We urge the public to
take heed of this message and ensure that they immediately dispose of
this product and to be aware of the signs and symptoms of botulism,
which include blurred vision, difficulty swallowing, headaches and
muscle weakness."

[In the UK, a korma usually refers not to a particular cooking
technique but to a curry with a thick, cream-based sauce or gravy
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korma). The korma popularized in UK
curry houses is invariably mildly spicy and may often feature nuts,
usually almonds or cashews, and coconut.

Hopefully, there will be no additional cases. - Mod.LL]
