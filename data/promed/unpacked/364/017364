In your report on the Danish BSE situation on ProMED-mail of 9 Mar 2000,
you also mention the Swedish situation regarding BSE. I got the impression
that you related a number of suspected cases in Sweden, wherefore I would
like to clarify your statement.
In Sweden BSE is regulated under the Act of Epizootics which means both
vets and farmers have to report clinical cases of CNS (Central Nervious
System) disturbances to the Competent authority. We also have a
surveillance program in accordance with 98/272 EU. During 1999 we
investigated our quota of 60 animals. Restrictions on individual animals
and on farm level were imposed in a few cases due to clinical history. In
1999 all 60 investigated animals were negative for BSE. In 1998, 57 animals
were investigated under the same scheme -- all negative. Sweden banned the
feeding of ruminant protein to ruminants in 1991 and further extended the
ban to mammalian protein to ruminants in accordance with the 1994 EU directive.
