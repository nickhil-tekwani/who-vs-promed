Preliminary results of investigations into a cluster of _Salmonella
livingstone_ suggest that travel to Tunisia is a risk factor for infection.
A questionnaire asking for information about cases of _S. livingstone_ was
sent to all Enter-net participants and European Programme for Intervention
Epidemiology Training (EPIET) fellows on 18 December. It was requested that
as many cases as possible be interviewed and information about travel in the
week before onset of illness ascertained.
Questionnaires about 36 cases from four Enter-net countries had been
returned by 0900 hours on 23 December. Twenty-eight cases gave a history of
travel before the onset of illness, and 25 cases were associated with travel
to Tunisia. The dates of onset of illness ranged between August and
November. Information is also available about eight cases from one other
country that were reported by the reference laboratory during November.
These eight cases had all been in Tunisia in October and the first week of
November. This report will be updated as further information becomes available.
