Infectious laryngotracheitis has been confirmed in a backyard poultry flock in the Riverland.

Biosecurity SA's chief veterinary officer Dr Roger Paskin advised that approximately 10 per cent of the flock were affected with a sudden onset of respiratory signs at the time of notification.

Further testing revealed there was no evidence of the highly infectious Avian Influenza or Newcastle Disease (ILT can be similar in its presentation to the clinical signs of both of these exotic diseases).

Dr Paskin said while Biosecurity SA identified there were no commercial poultry farms in the immediate area of the case, the industry in general has been advised of the occurrence to enable them to consider the risk and take any required actions to further minimize that risk.

"This is a timely reminder that even though we have detected ILT in the Riverland, it is endemic in the backyard chicken population and could be easily occurring elsewhere in SA," he said. "Ensuring you adhere to strict biosecurity procedures and vaccinations are your best protection against ILT. Therefore we are reminding all poultry owners across the State of the importance of maintaining a high level of biosecurity on their premises and to report immediately any significant disease events so that thorough investigations can be swiftly and effectively performed. There are PIRSA subsidies available to reduce the cost of these investigations to the individual producer."

Poultry and wild bird disease investigations are regularly performed by private veterinarians with assistance from Biosecurity SA as a part of our Avian Influenza and Newcastle Disease surveillance program.

ILT is a highly contagious respiratory disease in poultry that has been identified in most countries around the world and remains a threat to the intensive chicken industry.

The disease is characterised by gasping, neck extension and conjunctivitis (inflammation of the membrane around the eyes).

Early signs may include bouts of hard swallowing, ruffled feathers on the back of the head, squinting and the watering of one or both eyes (conjunctivitis).

[Infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is an acute, highly contagious herpesvirus infection of chickens and pheasants characterized by severe dyspnea, coughing, and rales. It can also be a subacute disease with nasal and ocular discharge, tracheitis, conjunctivitis, and mild rales. The disease is caused by _Gallid herpesvirus I_, commonly known as infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV).

There are a number of different tests capable of confirming this disease, including virus isolation and histology; and a rapid test is PCR, just to mention a few.

In endemic areas and on farms where a specific diagnosis is made, the disease is controlled by implementation of biosecurity measures and vaccination. Vaccination is done with live attenuated vaccines and viral vector recombinant vaccines. Live vaccines originated from virulent isolates that were attenuated by consecutive passages in embryos or tissue culture. These are applied via eye drop or through mass vaccination by water or spray. Viral vector recombinant vaccines in fowlpox and herpesvirus of turkeys have been designed to express ILTV immunogenic proteins and are administered to individual birds by in-ovo, subcutaneous, or wing-web vaccination.
