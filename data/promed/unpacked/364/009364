I live in the Faroe Islands -- a very nice place in the Northern
Atlantic Ocean!
We have had a new outbreak (second outbreak in the Faroes [see ref.
above) of ISA in Oyndarfjorour (reported to the OIE 18 Mar 2001). So
far there has been very low mortality, and only detected in one net
pen, which has now been slaughtered out.
