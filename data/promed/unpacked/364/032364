XYLELLA, ALMOND - ISRAEL: FIRST REPORT

The NPPO [National Plant Protection Organisation] of Israel recently informed EPPO of the 1st record of _Xylella fastidiosa_ (EPPO A2 List) on its territory. During a survey carried out in 2017-2018, a few symptomatic almond (_Prunus dulcis_) trees were discovered and subsequently eradicated. More recently, symptomatic almond trees were discovered in 3 adjacent commercial orchards in the northeastern part of Israel. Symptomatic leaf samples were tested. Results confirmed the presence of _X. fastidiosa_ subsp. _fastidiosa_.

The origin of the disease in Israel is unknown. Surveys are ongoing to verify the absence of the disease in other areas. So far, almond trees in other parts of Israel have been found to be free of _X. fastidiosa_. In the infected area, nurseries were found to be free. Other potential hosts in the area (grapevine, olive, oleander and _Prunus_ spp. other than almonds) were also found to be free. All Cicadomorpha (including Cicadellidae) from the infected orchards were collected. To date, no insects have been found to be infected with the bacterium. Awareness-raising meetings have been carried out with the Israeli almond growers' board, and nurseries have been informed.

[_Xylella fastidiosa_ (Xf) clogs the xylem of plants leading to wilting, necrosis, and often death. It causes many serious crop diseases such as Pierce's disease of grapevine; leaf scorch of coffee, almond, and olive; peach phony disease; plum leaf scald; citrus variegated chlorosis; lucerne dwarf; leaf scorch of a range of other woody species. Latent infections of wild species as potential pathogen reservoirs have also been reported. A second species in the genus, _X. taiwanensis_, has recently been reported as the cause of a pear leaf scorch (see ProMED-mail post 20181022.6105629).

Xf is spread by xylem-feeding insects, but also by grafting and with infected plant material. It is not seed borne. Moist conditions favour the vectors and therefore Xf-associated diseases. Disease management is difficult due to the large numbers of hosts and vectors and may include use of clean planting and grafting material, as well as vector control. Both the bacterium and its main vectors are of serious international quarantine concern and are currently considered the most serious threat to European grape and fruit production.

Three subspecies have been formally accepted for Xf: _fastidiosa_ (grapevine strain, Pierce's disease), _pauca_ and _multiplex_, but additional ones have been proposed. It appears that subspecies vary in host range, but more research is needed on susceptibility of different plant hosts to the different Xf subspecies, and multiple Xf subspecies have been found to be able to infect the same host species (such as, both _pauca_ and _multiplex_ can affect olives). The initial European detection in olives was of ssp. _pauca_ in southern Italy, but all 3 ssp. have since been found in different European areas in a range of hosts. More information on distribution, epidemiology and the risks to different crops of Xf or its subspecies are needed urgently in order to assess the risk to crops worldwide.

Xf had previously been reported mainly from the Americas. In Europe, it was first reported in olives from Italy in 2013 (ProMED-mail posts 20131101.2033095, 20140820.2708739, and 20140424.2425497). The subsequent detection of multiple subspecies in a diversity of hosts, including some asymptomatic ornamentals, suggested that some Xf strains had to have been present in the region for a considerable amount of time. The report above appears to be the 1st report from the Mediterranean region outside of Europe, however, Xf has been reported elsewhere in the Middle East, from Iran, in 2014 (see link below).
