[1] USA (Houston, TX): delta variant

https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/health/article/Delta-variant-confirmed-at-Houston-area-church-16296602.php


Multiple cases of the delta variant have been traced to a COVID-19 outbreak at a camp hosted by a Houston-area church last month [June 2021], Galveston County officials said Tuesday [6 Jul 2021]. All told, the Galveston County Health Authority has confirmed that 57 people -- most of them older than 12 -- were infected by COVID-19 at a youth church camp hosted by Clear Creek Community Church in League City.

Officials said Tuesday that another 90 people have self-reported positive cases that are believed associated with the camp. Of the cases examined by Galveston authorities, 6 are breakthrough cases -- defined as someone becoming infected more than 14 days after their 2nd COVID-19 vaccination. At least 3 are the delta variant, a highly contagious mutation of COVID-19 that has been making its way through the United States.

Galveston officials said they expect numbers to continue to rise as they test continue testing throughout the week. "The delta variant is highly contagious, more so than other strains. And people who are unvaccinated are at most risk," said Dr. Philip Keiser, Galveston County local health authority.

[2] CIDRAP: monoclonal antibody for severe COVID, global news
Date: Tue 6 Jul 2021

The World Health Organization (WHO) today [6 Jul 2021] recommended the use of anti-inflammatory monoclonal antibodies -- tocilizumab and sarilumab -- alongside corticosteroids for treating patients who have severe or critical COVID-19 infections.

The WHO's treatment recommendation comes in the wake of a study published today [6 Jul 2021] in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), in which researchers analyzed 27 randomized trials that involved nearly 11 000 patients (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2781880).

They found that the interleukin-6 antagonists tocilizumab and sarilumab reduced the risk of death and the need for mechanical ventilation. The WHO coordinated the study, which included partners from the United Kingdom.

The investigators found that the drugs were most effective when given with corticosteroids. Hospitalized patients who got one of the drugs along with corticosteroids had a 17% reduction in death compared with corticosteroids given alone. The combination cut the risk of mechanical ventilation or death by 21% compared with corticosteroids alone.

Immune system overreaction is a feature of severe COVID-19 infection, and the 2 drugs -- both initially developed to treat rheumatoid arthritis -- were thought to have the potential to inhibit the interleukin-6 cytokines that the immune system generates during those instances. Earlier individual studies were inconclusive, ranging from benefit to no effect to harm.

For the study, the WHO and UK researchers combined data from 27 randomized trials spanning 28 countries. Taken together, the meta-analysis included 6449 patients who were randomly assigned an interleukin-6 antagonist and 4481 who received usual care or placebo.

The risk of death within 28 days was lower in those who received the drugs, and outcomes were better in patients who were also treated with corticosteroids. For every 100 patients treated with corticosteroids, 4 more survived.

And when the team looked at death and mechanical ventilator outcomes, they found that adding the drugs meant that, for every 100 such patients, 7 more will survive. Janet Diaz, MD, clinical management lead for the WHO's health emergencies program, said in a King's College London news release that bringing together the results of international trials is one of the best ways to determine which treatments will save lives. (https://www.who.int/news/item/06-07-2021-who-recommends-life-saving-interleukin-6-receptor-blockers-for-covid-19-and-urges-producers-to-join-efforts-to-rapidly-increase-access).

"While science has delivered, we must now turn our attention to access. Given the extent of global vaccine inequity, people in the lowest income countries will be the ones most at risk of severe and critical COVID-19. Those are the people these drugs need to reach," she said.

In a related commentary, 2 scientists who weren't involved in the study said the treatments are promising for hospitalized patients with progressive disease and substantial oxygen requirements. The authors are Michael Matthay, MD, an acute respiratory disease specialist, and Anne Leutkemeyer, MD, an infectious disease expert, both based at the University of California, San Francisco (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/278188).

They said questions surround how the drugs compare to other interventions and what threshold to use for using them, though for now, they don't seem destined for widespread use in patients with mild disease or in patients who have been on prolonged mechanical ventilation.

In other global developments, some countries, including Indonesia, Viet Nam, and Bangladesh, reported new record daily highs for infections, as COVID-19 cases continued to rise in parts of Europe.

Indonesia's daily COVID-19 total rose to a new record high of 31 189 new cases, with a daily record 728 deaths reported, according to Xinhua, China's state news agency. Cases have been reported from all of the country's provinces, though roughly one-third of the daily cases are from Jakarta (http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/asiapacific/2021-07/06/c_1310045931.htm).

The country's surge is overwhelming some hospitals, as well as the supply of oxygen. Dozens of patients reportedly died at a public hospital on the island of Java when the facility ran out of oxygen over the weekend, according to the Washington Post (https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/05/indonesia-coronavirus-oxygen-shortage/).

Meanwhile, Viet Nam yesterday [5 Jul 2021] reported 1102 new cases, the 1st time the country -- known for its strong public health response -- has topped 1000 in a single day, according to Reuters (https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-vietnam/vietnam-reports-record-1102-new-coronavirus-infections-idUSL3N2OH2KW).

The country's latest COVID wave started in late April [2021], and though cases have been reported across the country, Ho Chi Minh City accounts for the most, according to the VN Express newspaper (https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/vietnam-s-covid-tally-tops-1-000-for-second-straight-day-4303684.html).

More global headlines
- Bangladesh, another country reporting record cases and deaths, announced that it will extend its lockdown until 14 Jul 2021, according to Reuters (https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bangladesh-extends-lockdown-combat-covid-19-surge-2021-07-05/).

- Japan announced it will extend its quasi state of emergency for Tokyo and 3 surrounding prefectures through the Olympics owing to rising COVID-19 cases, according to Nikkei Asia (https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Coronavirus/Japan-to-extend-COVID-restrictions-for-30m-people-until-after-Olympics).

- Israel yesterday [5 Jul 2021] reported a drop in Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine effectiveness against infections and symptoms amid delta (B1617.2) variant spread and relaxed restrictions, though it is still highly effective against serious illness. Since 6 Jun 2021, efficacy against infection and symptomatic disease declined to 64%, with efficacy against serious illness and hospitalization at 93%, according to the country's health ministry (https://www.gov.il/en/departments/news/05072021-03).

- UK government officials signaled that they will proceed with full reopening on 19 Jul 2021, despite rising cases, given the positive impact of vaccination. The country is experiencing a rise in cases without a steep rise in hospitalizations, with infections up 53% over the past week (https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-at-coronavirus-press-conference-5-july-2021).

- The global total today [6 Jul 2021] rose to 184 394 772 cases, and 3 988 239 people have died from their infections, according to the Johns Hopkins online dashboard (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html).

[3] Indonesia: oxygen shortage
Date: Mon 5 Jul 2021
Source: Al Jazeera [edited]
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/5/indonesia-copes-with-oxygen-shortages-as-covid-cases-quadruple


Indonesia is struggling with one of Asia's worst coronavirus outbreaks as new cases more than quadrupled in a month, prompting a critical shortage of oxygen in several areas. At least 33 people died at a hospital in Yogyakarta when its supply ran out over the weekend and the government on Monday [5 Jul 2021] asked oxygen producers to send all their supplies to hospitals and clinics.

The highly contagious delta variant of COVID-19 has led to a huge increase in infections across the country. On Monday [5 Jul 2021], Indonesia reported 29 745 new infections and 558 deaths, both daily records, after the government last week ordered new virus curbs in the hard-hit capital, Jakarta, across Java, and on holiday island Bali. Mosques, parks, shopping malls and restaurants were shut in hotspot areas, while non-essential employees were ordered to work from home.

Bambang Harymurti, a public affairs analyst in Jakarta, told Al Jazeera the situation on the ground is getting worse. "If you look around, many hospitals are either closed because they are so full, they don't admit any more patients and they are asking people to donate oxygens. The government is asking people not to buy oxygen because hospitals need them," he said. "And in fact, the authorities said the police might have to raid many places by Thursday [8 Jul 2021] if this situation where people are lining up to buy oxygens and essential medicine [continues]. Medicine prices are sky high now."

The world's 4th most populous nation has seen its daily caseload more than quadruple in less than a month and its tally stands at 2.3 million cases and 61 140 deaths. But that figure is widely believed to be a severe undercount because of low testing and poor tracing measures.

Indonesia's overwhelmed healthcare system has been teetering on the brink of collapse as jammed hospitals turned away patients, forcing desperate families to hunt for oxygen tanks to treat the sick and dying at home. Daily COVID burials in Jakarta are up 10-fold since May [2021], and patients are increasingly dying in isolation at home.

Independent virus data group LaporCOVID has said at least 269 people in 10 provinces have died while in self-isolation. Jakarta's health agency said 45 people died at home on Friday [2 Jul 2021] alone. There are no official national statistics on the number of COVID deaths at home.

Abstract
--------
Background: The long-term sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children remain poorly characterised. This study aimed to assess long-term outcomes in children previously hospitalised with COVID-19 and associated risk factors.

Methods: This is a prospective cohort study of children (18 years old and younger) admitted with confirmed COVID-19. Children admitted to the hospital between 2 Apr 2020 and 26 Aug 2020 were included. Telephone interview using the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) COVID-19 Health and Wellbeing paediatric follow-up survey. Persistent symptoms (more than 5 months) were further categorised by system(s) involved.

Findings: 518 of 853 (61%) of eligible children were available for the follow-up assessment and included in the study. Median age was 10.4 years (IQR, 3-15.2) and 270 (52.1%) were girls; median follow-up since hospital discharge was 256 (223-271) days. At the time of the follow-up interview, 126 (24.3%) participants reported persistent symptoms among which fatigue (53, 10.7%), sleep disturbance (36, 6.9%,) and sensory problems (29, 5.6%) were the most common. Multiple symptoms were experienced by 44 (8.4%) participants. Risk factors for persistent symptoms were older age "6-11 years" (odds ratio 2.74 (95% confidence interval 1.37 to 5.75) and "12-18 years" (2.68, 1.41 to 5.4); and a history of allergic diseases (1.67, 1.04 to 2.67).

Interpretation: One-quarter of children experienced persistent symptoms months after hospitalization with acute COVID-19 infection, with almost one in 10 experiencing multi-system involvement. Older age and allergic diseases were associated with higher risk of persistent symptoms at follow-up.

Introduction
------------
Emerging data suggest that a substantial proportion of people experience ongoing symptoms including fatigue and muscle weakness, breathlessness, and neurological problems more than 6 months after the acute phase of COVID-19 (1,2 [see source URL for complete references]). This phenomenon is commonly referred to as "long COVID", a term defined by patient groups, and also known as post-COVID syndrome, the post-COVID-19 condition (3) or "COVID long-haulers (4,5). Recent population data from the UK reported that the highest prevalence of long COVID after 12 weeks was among those aged 25 to 34 years (18.2%) and lowest in the 2 to 11 years age bracket (7.4%) (6).

Evidence on post-acute COVID condition and long-term outcomes in children is still limited to small studies with more than half having at least one persisting symptom 4 months after COVID-19 infection (7). However, a recent publication from Australia suggested that only 8% of children aged 0-19 years (median 3 years) had ongoing symptoms 3-6 months after predominantly mild COVID-19 infection. The limitation of the study as acknowledged by the authors was the low age range. This mandates the larger numbers inclusion particularly of older children in future studies (8).

There is a need to assess the long-term consequences of COVID-19 in paediatric populations (9), to inform clinicians, researchers and public health experts and address the impacts of this condition on those affected and their families and to inform discussions on vaccination of children. This cohort study aimed to investigate the incidence of and risk factors for long-term COVID-19 outcomes in children post-hospital discharge. We used the standardised follow-up data collection protocol developed by the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC) Global Paediatric COVID-19 follow-up working group (10).

Conclusion
----------
Although symptoms which were present at discharge diminished over time, even 8 months after hospital discharge many children experienced persistent symptoms, with fatigue, sensory changes and sleep problems being the most common sequelae. One in 10 children experienced multi-system involvement at the time of the follow-up. Age and allergic disease were the main risk factors for persistent symptoms. Future work should be multidisciplinary, prospective, preferably with a control cohort, repeated sampling and with an ability for children to report their health and wellbeing themselves, accompanied by biological sample collection to establish causative mechanisms for a better understanding of COVID-19 sequelae and help with the phenotype/endotype categorisation.

[5] Immigration detention centers and prisons
Date: Tue 6 Jul 2021

As their populations swell nearly to prepandemic levels, US immigration detention centers are reporting major surges in coronavirus infections among detainees. Public health officials, noting that few detainees are vaccinated against the virus, warn that the increasingly crowded facilities can be fertile ground for outbreaks.

The number of migrants being held in the detention centers has nearly doubled in recent months as border apprehensions have risen, according to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. More than 26 000 people were in detention last week, compared with about 14 000 in April [2021].

More than 7500 new coronavirus cases have been reported in the centers over that same period, accounting for more than 40% of all cases reported in ICE facilities since the pandemic began, according to a New York Times analysis of ICE data.

Prisons and jails in America were hotbeds for the virus last year [2020], with nearly one in 3 inmates at federal and state facilities testing positive. The virus infected and killed prisoners at a faster rate than it did in nearby populations because of crowding and other factors that made ideal conditions for COVID to spread.

As of May [2021], according to ICE's latest available data, only about 20% of detainees passing through the centers had received at least one dose of vaccine while in custody. Dr. Carlos Franco-Paredes, an associate professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine who has inspected immigration detention centers during the pandemic, said that several factors were to blame for the surge, including transfers of detainees between facilities, insufficient testing and lax COVID-19 safety measures.

For example, he said, during a recent inspection at a center in Aurora, Colo., he saw many staff members who were not wearing face coverings properly, adding: "There is minimal to no accountability regarding their protocols."

Paige Hughes, an ICE spokeswoman, said that all new detainees were tested for the coronavirus and are held in quarantine for 14 days on arrival. "On-site medical professionals are credited with reducing the risk of further spreading the disease by immediately testing, identifying and isolating the exposed detainees to mitigate the spread of infection," she said.

Even so, public health officials point out that detainees are transported to the facilities by bus before they are tested and may be exposed during the trip. Similar lapses by prison systems over the past year have led to mass infections and deaths.

ICE officials said the agency's policy was to leave decisions about vaccinating detainees to state and local officials. Some of the worst outbreaks at ICE facilities, including one at the Adams County Correctional Center in Natchez, Miss., have been in states where vaccination rates are far below the national average, according to a Times database.

As concerns grow over the spread of the more transmissible delta variant of the coronavirus, Sharon Dolovich, a law professor and director of the COVID Behind Bars Data Project at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that detainees would remain vulnerable to outbreaks until officials made vaccinations at these sites a higher priority.

"You have people coming in and out of the facility, into communities where incomplete vaccination allows these variants to flourish, and then you bring them inside the facilities, and that variant will spread," Dr. Dolovich said. "What you're describing is the combination of insufficient vaccination plus the evolution of the virus, and that is really scary."

[The same problem of inequity in handling COVID protective measures is occurring at immigration detention centers and prisons. Inmates in both types of facilities have no ability to separate from each other and must be provided with masks, as they have no personal access to them. Furthermore, there appears to be no dedication to vaccinating these populations, making for a high-risk situation. Infections will spread outside the facilities, prolonging the pandemic and potentially leading to further evolution of mutants.
