Bird flu spreads further in West Bengal, culling on
-----------------------------------------------------
Bird flu in West Bengal has spread to new areas, tests confirmed
Saturday [19 Jan 2008] even as efforts were on to contain the
outbreak by culling poultry in the affected areas.

"The new areas are Burdwan and Nadia districts. The laboratory tests
in Bhopal confirmed the spread of the disease to Mangalkot and
Purbasthali in Burdwan and Tehatta in Nadia. It was also confirmed
that the deaths in Murshidabad district's Khargram and Baroa were
also from the virus," West Bengal Animal Resource Development
Minister Anisur Rahman told IANS.

The 2 districts are in southern West Bengal and barely 200 km [124
miles] from Kolkata.

"We have to step up the culling operation further in view of the new
reports of bird flu confirmation," Rahman said.

The agriculture ministry said in a statement in New Delhi Saturday:
"Samples from 4 blocks of Murshidabad district (Khargram, Burwan,
Nowda and Nabagram), one block of Nadia district (Tehatta) and 2
blocks of Burdwan district (Mongalkote and Purbasthali) have been
found positive for avian influenza by rapid tests. The state
government has been notified.

"The samples from South 24 Parganas, Cooch Behar, Purulia and Hooghly
districts have tested negative for avian influenza. Result of the
samples sent from Bankura district is awaited from HSADL (High
Security Animal Disease Laboratory), Bhopal," it said.

The state had set a target of slaughtering 400 000 poultry birds but
with the spread of the disease to new areas at least 200 000 more
birds might have to be killed.

"We have been able to cull nearly 60 000 birds so far. The health and
animal resource development workers are tirelessly engaged in killing
the birds," Rahman said.

The agriculture ministry said: "As per the latest information
received, a total mortality of 96 010 poultry birds has been reported
from Birbhum, South Dinajpur, Murshidabad, Nadia, South 24 Parganas,
Burdwan and Bankura districts of West Bengal. This number stood at 85
006 till yesterday (Fri 18 Jan 2008)."

Meanwhile, Union Minister of State for Health Panabaka Lakshmi said:
"We are not satisfied (with the measures to combat bird flu in West
Bengal)." Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a function in
Kolkata, she did not specify where the state was lacking. She however
alleged the compensation paid for the poultry losers was not properly
distributed.

Alarmed by the outbreak of the disease, dubbed the worst in India by
the World Health Organization (WHO), West Bengal Chief Minister
Buddhadeb Bhattacharya Friday said the state government would
slaughter all poultry birds in areas reporting fresh cases of bird
flu even before laboratories confirm the H5N1 strain.

"We have earmarked a sum of Rs.30 million [USD 763 942] as
compensation for those losing their poultry birds," Rahman said Saturday.

Farmers were being handed over tokens at culling sites and asked to
contact their panchayat [village council] offices for the money. The
payment is Rs.40 [USD 1.02] for a country chicken, Rs.30 [USD 0.765]
for a broiler and Rs.10 [USD 0.255] for a chick.

While the minister said the culling operation had been stepped up,
reports from the districts said the process was slow, often owing to
villagers' resistance to the Rapid Response Team (RRT) carrying out
the cull. But in some areas where a large number of poultry birds had
died of the infection, the villagers were more eager to offer their
chickens and ducks for culling.

"In the next 7 days we will kill all the birds (an estimated 400 000)
by increasing the number of health and animal resource development
(ARD) workers," the chief minister told reporters Friday. "Wherever
we will hear of new infections, we will kill birds. There are at the
moment 60 teams comprising 5 workers each. We will increase the
manpower," he said.

The H5N1 virus causes a type of influenza in birds that is highly
contagious and can be deadly. It does not usually infect people
unless they come in close contact with infected birds or contaminated surfaces.

On the job, but far from target: farmers refuse to give up poultry
------------------------------------------------------------------
Resistance from poultry owners and fear of confrontation prevented a
door-to-door culling here today, officials of the animal husbandry
department said.

Reports received late in the evening said 6000 birds had been culled.
The target was around 26 500 chickens within a 5km [3.1 mile] radius
of the state-run farm, where tests have confirmed the outbreak of the
deadly H5N1 or the bird flu virus. In the farm, all the 1444 birds
were culled yesterday [17Jan 2008].

The South Dinajpur animal husbandry department has formed 49 rapid
response teams for the purpose. Sritanu Maity, the deputy director of
animal husbandry in the district, had said it took time to do the
groundwork and hence the delay in starting the culling, which ought
to have started yesterday.

Today, the team members claimed that there was a suppressed tension
in town because of opposition from poultry owners.

"Why should we bring our chickens and ducks to you? They are fine and
eating well. Besides, the compensation you are offering us is too low
compared to the actual value of the birds. You are giving us Rs 30
for birds which cost Rs 100," said a villager, echoing a common
refrain in Koaron, Khidirpur, Dangi and Amritkhanda, areas located on
the outskirts of the town.

A team-member on condition of anonymity said there was bound to be
trouble if there was a house-to-house raid. To prevent it, the
department set up camps at various places and asked people to bring
the poultry there for culling.

Chicken-sellers like Bipul Laha from Koaron, however, stuck to the
argument that since the infection had taken place in a closed area
like the state farm, there was little chance of the outbreak
spreading. But a delay in preventive action provides the H5N1 virus
the opportunity to move away from its index zone -- the farm where
chickens might have first become infected -- to neighbouring farms in
the same district or even beyond.

Unlike yesterday, there was virtually no sale of chicken in town.
Even eateries had removed chicken items from their menus.

Sujit Dutta, the assistant commissioner of animal husbandry at the
Centre, claimed that everything was going according to plan. "There
have been minor snags which are being dealt with effectively," he said.

Around 250km [155 miles] away in Cooch Behar, the district
administration has been instructed by the state government to send
samples of droppings of migratory birds. A directive from the Centre
states that the avian flu outbreak has taken place in Kurigram in
Bangladesh, which is 34km [21 miles] from Cooch Behar.

Tapan Kumar Roy, the deputy director of the district animal husbandry
department, said samples were being collected from Rasikbeel and Sagardighi.

Bird Flu Cases Detected
------------------------
State Veterinary Organization has announced that migratory and
indigenous birds have tested positive for H5N1 bird flu virus.

"Avian flu, earlier reported for migratory swans in the Anzali
International Wetland in northern Iran, has been detected among
geese, ducks and domestic hens in Barzanghib village near the
wetland," the Organization's chief, Mojtaba Norouzi told ISNA
[Iranian Students' News Agency] Friday [18 Jan 2008]. "Laboratory
tests in Italy confirmed that Iran's wild and native birds had been
infected by the H5N1 bird flu virus."

The Organization culled domestic birds of the village to prevent the
outbreak of the deadly virus in the vicinity of the wetland, he said,
urging locals to avoid hunting.

H5N1 is the bird flu strain that scientists worry could mutate into a
form easily passed to humans. With thousands of migratory geese,
ducks and other wildfowl heading for the province for the winter,
local authorities are on high alert, he said. The official had
earlier told the news agency that the organization destroys any
poultry in places where birds have been detected with suspicious
respiratory diseases.

Iran had officially announced an outbreak of bird flu among migratory
birds in late 2005. It was reported last week [7-11 Jan 2008] that
Indonesia and Iran reached a tentative deal to co-produce bird flu vaccines.

[The above newswire seems to be the first report on the H5N1 outbreak
published by the Iranian media. Timely detection of new outbreaks and
effective disease control activities depend, to a large extent, upon
the animal growers' cooperation and the supportive involvement of the
public at large. Such cooperation can be achieved only if official,
scientifically-based information on the disease situation is readily
available and its reliability secured.

According to the official notification of Iran's Ministry of
Agriculture, submitted to the OIE on 16 Jan 2008, samples from the
suspected cases in Mazandaran were found positive by the real-time
PCR test on 12 Dec 2007; the test was performed by the National
Laboratory, namely the central laboratory of Iran's Veterinary
Organisation in Teheran. The outbreak in Mazandaran remained
unpublished for at least 5 weeks. On 8 Jan 2008, final confirmation
was received from the reference laboratory in Italy; it is not clear
when were the samples sent to Italy. Only 8 days later, and 6 weeks
after the start of the outbreak, was an official notification
submitted to the OIE.

The deficient transparency in this case was further illuminated by
the fact that Iran's minister of health, Kamran Baqeri Lankarani,
told the press on 24 Dec 2007 that "no confirmed instances of the
avian flu have been seen in the country" (see at
<http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=36188§ionid=3510210>).
Hopefully, such discrepancies (or poor interministerial
communication?!) will become a rarity in the future. - Mod.AS]
