Gregory's Gift of Hope Animal Shelter in New Richmond will remain quarantined until 1 Dec 2016 after an outbreak of canine brucellosis.

Canine brucellosis is a reproductive disease that affects dogs, according to the United States Department of Agriculture.

Several animals from the rescue have been infected by the [bacterium], according to a press release from the organization. Gregory's said anyone who has adopted a dog between 15 Jun 2015 and 1 Sep 2016 should have the animal tested with their current veterinarian. All dogs were considered exposed to the [bacterium] by the Wisconsin statute regarding zoonotic diseases. "Although it is very rare, it can cause devastation when it is diagnosed," the release said.

The rescue has closed its boarding services and dog adoption to be proactive of the possible spread of the [bacterium]. Rescue personnel became aware of the exposure after an adopted dog was diagnosed with the [bacterium]. "We remind people this is a population problem (the animals themselves) not a facility issue, so when we re-open, there is no concern for spreading of the [bacteria]," Gregory's press release stated.

As a no-kill shelter, Gregory's said it is having each of its dogs tested and put through the quarantine period rather than euthanization as many other shelters would. "Being the only operating animal shelter in the county and being placed in this position has been very hard on all of us here at the organization as well as the animals in need in our communities," the rescue said in its release.

Though the dog population is quarantined, Gregory's is continuing to help rescue cats in the area. The rescue is currently running a cat adoption special through the end of October 2016.

"With the weather turning, we are in great need of having forever homes found so we can continue to help those in need during the hard cold fall and winter months," the release stated.

[_Brucella melitensis_, _suis_ and _abortus_ species exhibit either rough (R) or smooth (S) colonies on growth in the lab, determined by expression of O-polysaccharide chain as a component of the bacterial outer membrane lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (endotoxin). Loss of expression of O chains results in rough colonial variants. _B. canis_ lack the O chain naturally and only has a rough colonial form.

The virulence of _Brucella_ for humans is mainly associated with smooth colonial phenotypes of _B. melitensis_, _suis_, and _abortus_, and conventional serological techniques (that is, agglutination tests) use smooth phase antigens that will diagnose infection due to _B. abortus_, _B. melitensis_, and _B. suis_, but are not useful for diagnosing infections caused by the rough species (_B. ovis_ and _B. canis_) in humans or dogs.

For additional information on brucellosis see: _B. suis_ in dogs: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3311166/ and http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperInformation.aspx?PaperID=34279#.VOdcGkLnesQ.

Canine brucellosis, caused by _Brucella canis_, is an important cause of reproductive failure, particularly in kennels. This organism causes abortions, stillbirths, epididymitis [inflammation of ducts next to the testicle], orchitis [inflammation of the testicle] and sperm abnormalities in dogs. Although dogs that have been spayed or neutered do not have reproductive signs, they occasionally develop other conditions such as ocular disease and discospondylitis (inflammation of the spinal vertebrae and intervertebral discs). _B. canis_ can persist in an animal even after antibiotic treatment. In kennels, infected dogs are often euthanized to prevent them from infecting other dogs or people. Canine brucellosis is sometimes difficult to diagnose with the currently available tests.

Although _B. canis_ is zoonotic, its importance as a cause of human illness is still unclear. Few cases have been reported in people, and most of these infections have been mild. However, human infections with _B. canis_ may be underdiagnosed. The symptoms of this disease are nonspecific, diagnostic suspicion is low among physicians, and bacterial culture is the only commonly available test for diagnosis in people.

_B. canis_ occurs in the fetus, placenta, fetal fluids, and vaginal discharge after an abortion or stillbirth. It can persist in vaginal discharges for several weeks after an abortion. It is also shed in normal vaginal secretions, particularly during estrus, as well as in milk. High concentrations of _B. canis_ may be found in semen for weeks or months after infection, and intermittent shedding of smaller quantities can occur for years. _B. canis_ is also shed in urine, and low concentrations of bacteria may be excreted in saliva, nasal and ocular secretions and feces.

In dogs, _B. canis_ primarily enters the body by ingestion and through the genital, oronasal and conjunctival mucosa, but transmission through broken skin may also be possible. Most cases are thought to be acquired by venereal transmission or by contact with the fetus and fetal membranes after abortions and stillbirths. Puppies can be infected in utero, and may remain persistently infected even if they appear normal. Nursing puppies can be infected from milk, but the importance of this route is controversial. Other potential sources of infection include blood transfusions and contaminated syringes.

_B. canis_ can be spread on fomites. In conditions of high humidity, low temperatures and no sunlight, _Brucella_ spp can remain viable for several months in water, aborted fetuses, feces, equipment, and clothing. _Brucella_ spp can withstand drying, particularly when organic material is present, and can survive in dust and soil. Survival is longer when the temperature is low, particularly when it is below freezing.

Humans usually become infected with members of the genus _Brucella_ by ingesting organisms or via the contamination of mucous membranes and abraded skin. In case reports, _B. canis_ infections have been described after close contact with dogs, especially animals that recently aborted or gave birth, and after exposure to large amounts of the organism in laboratories (such as, contact with bacterial cultures). However, the source of the organism could not be determined in some cases.

While documented human cases of _B. canis_ are rare, and may be underreported, immunocompromised people should be especially careful around animals known to be positive for _B. canis_.

_Brucella canis_ in dogs is not common, but nor is it rare. Gerald Hoff found that 4% of Florida pound dogs had positive titres of 1:200 or higher; see Brucella canis, dogs, retrospective - USA (Florida) 19980518.0954. At one time, it was considered as a possible BW agent, but its lack of virulence for humans took it off the table. - Mod.MHJ
