[The nosocomial outbreak in Buraidah continues, as well as the occurrence of sporadic cases associated with contact with camels. There have now been 17 newly confirmed cases reported from Buraidah since 3 Mar 2016. The true index case of this outbreak has not been identified, as cases started occurring on an almost daily basis (3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 Mar 2016). The 1st 2 newly confirmed cases were classified as primary cases but no history of contact with camels; the next 4 cases were classified as under investigation; beginning on 7 Mar 2016, cases were classified as secondary healthcare associated cases. It would be interesting to know whether retrospective case finding among hospital patients seen in the 2 weeks prior to 3 Mar 2016 included individuals with symptoms compatible with a diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection but were either not tested for the virus or were negative on the testing performed.

The 2 newly confirmed primary cases with a history of contact with camels involved an individual from Makkah province (Taif) and an individual from the Eastern Province (Jubail).
