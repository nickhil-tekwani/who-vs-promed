A 46 year old woman should make a full recovery, but a suspected case
of Rocky Mountain spotted fever has turned her world upside-down since
June 2011.

Rocky Mountain spotted fever is a tickborne disease that can cause a
potentially fatal illness. It is caused by bacteria transmitted by the
bite of an infected tick to people. In the USA, the American dog tick,
Rocky Mountain wood tick, and brown dog tick can be carriers.

The woman said she was at work when she discovered an American dog
tick so deeply buried behind her earlobe it took coworkers 10 minutes
to remove it. "I was grossed out, but I wasn't too worried because I
know people get bit by ticks all the time and nothing usually
happens," she said. Unfortunately, her experience was different.

"I began getting really bad headaches and my glands swelled," she
said. "I don't know if that's because I got bit in the head or not. I
had constant pain and nausea and my calves hurt really bad." After 3
days, I was so sick I couldn't even get out of bed." The Lucas
resident researched her symptoms online. When all signs pointed to
Rocky Mountain spotted fever, she decided to begin taking doxycycline,
an antimicrobial her daughter was using for acne, which is also used
to treat the condition. Right away she began to feel better.

A blood test for Rocky Mountain spotted fever would eventually return
positive. Recently, the Mansfield/Ontario/Richland County Health
Department issued a warning for the disease. It's rare. "The last
reported case in Richland County was at least 30 years ago," said
Selby Dorgan, Health Promotion and Education manager. "The outcome of
that case is unknown to the Health Department. Since the year 2000,
Ohio has seen between 2 and 26 cases per year."

The woman said she believes she contracted the disease through one of
her 2 dogs, but said both have been checked and cleared.

Richland County dog warden Dave Jordan said ticks have been more
noticeable this year [2011] than he can remember in previous summers.
"We've noticed them a lot more on stray dogs, but I really don't know
why there seem to be so many more this year," he said. "Ticks can
attach anywhere, and when we do an examination of the dogs, we will
usually find them inside the ears. The ear is just usually the easier
place to spot them because dogs don't have hair in their ears."

[It is vital to diagnose this rickettsial infection promptly to
minimize morbidity and mortality. This is particularly true in areas
such as the midwestern USA as in this case, where the disease is
uncommon. Despite the misinformation that may be spread by the
internet, this woman's life may have been saved by the web.

When the female tick harboring the organism attaches to a passing
human, she usually starts low on the body after transferring from
grassy vegetation or even directly or indirectly from a dog. After
crawling around on clothes seeking an appropriate cutaneous site
(wearing white clothes makes a wandering tick easier to spot), she
attaches and begins to feed.

After attaching, it generally takes as many as 24 hours to activate
and transmit the rickettsial organism. For this reason, daily or twice
daily tick checks with removal will minimize disease transmission.
Ticks that attach in hairy areas such as the scalp or beard may be
more difficult to find.

Regarding the difficulty in removing this woman's tick, the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention
http://www.cdc.gov/ticks/removing_a_tick.html) suggests:

"If you find a tick attached to your skin, there's no need to panic.
There are several tick removal devices on the market, but a plain set
of fine-tipped tweezers will remove a tick quite effectively.

"Use fine-tipped tweezers to grasp the tick as close to the skin's
surface as possible. Pull upward with steady, even pressure. Don't
twist or jerk the tick; this can cause the mouth-parts to break off
and remain in the skin. If this happens, remove the mouth-parts with
tweezers. If you are unable to remove the mouth easily with clean
tweezers, leave it alone and let the skin heal.

"After removing the tick, thoroughly clean the bite area and your
hands with rubbing alcohol, an iodine scrub, or soap and water."

The incubation period of the disease is about a week after the tick
exposure, long after the tick has detached. The presenting illness is
generally nonspecific, fever, muscle pains, headache (but the headache
is usually described as quite severe). The rash begins in day 3 of
illness, initially maculopapular at the wrists and ankles before
becoming petechial and purpuric involving the palms and soles as well
as spreading proximally to the truck. Purpura usually are not seen
before the 6th day of illness. The mortality is indeed quite low if
treatment (usually a tetracycline) is begun during the 1st 2 days of
the rash or before.

Empiric treatment for this infection should always be begun in people
with compatible symptoms inhabiting endemic areas during the spring
and summer, even if no tick bite is known.

The female _Dermacentor variabilis_ (the American dog tick), a common
vector for this infection, can be seen at
