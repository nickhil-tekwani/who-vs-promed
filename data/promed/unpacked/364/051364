An outbreak of dysentery in Mandalay, following massive flooding in central
Burma in late July 2004, has been attributed to the bacterium _Vibrio
cholerae_, or cholera, said a local doctor in early September 2004. Yu Yu
May said that during the 1st week of Sep 2004, medical experts at hospitals
across the city detected about 10 new cases of cholera each day. Scores of
residents fell ill with severe diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration. Several
people died, although it is not clear whether cholera was the cause of
death in any of the cases. An official from the Health Department in
Mandalay refused to comment on the outbreak and said that news reporters
must first gain official permission before writing about it. Other reports
attributed the outbreak to food poisoning.

The diarrhea patients in Monga-stricken [monga is a local word for famine -
CopyEd.PG] areas of the district have been increasing rapidly day by day.
Many diarrhea-affected patients have been coming to Sadar hospital and
Upazila health complex to take treatment every day. Most of the patients
are children and old people. It is also learnt that oral saline and
cholera saline scarcity are hampering the treatment of patients.

Diarrhea spreads in Nilphamari
------------------------------
At least 3 persons died from diarrhea and about 2500 people have fallen ill
with the disease in Syedpr Upazila.
In the worst-affected 15 villages, there is no family without at least one
diarrhea patient, local people said. the villages include Telipara,
Hazipara, Pathan Para, Machhuapara, Wapda Natun Para, Suparno Khuli,
Balapra, Shaskandor, Khori Botlagari, Dhukuria Porarhat and Halipara.
Nilphamari Civil Surgeon Dr Abdur Rahim however told this correspondent
that the situation in Syedpur "is not out of control". He said 1105 people
have so far been treated in different government hospitals since the
outbreak of the disease about 10 days ago. 7 medical teams are working in
the affected villages, he said. But local people said medical teams do not
have adequate medicines and saline packets.
The civil surgeon admitted that field workers were given oral saline only
so that they could treat patients in the primary stage. But there is
shortage of medicines including IV saline, he said. The district health
workers and union Parishad members are using [loudspeakers] to caution and
advise people about the disease.
All the hospitals are crowded with patients. At least 80 patients a day
come to different hospitals, sources said. 25 patients were admitted to
Syedpur Hospital (50 beds) over the last 24 hours.

been reported from 14 Jun to 19 Aug 2004. The outbreak is declining in the
western part of the country except for Bousso, where there are new
outbreaks. The outbreak started in Massaguet (Hadjar Lamine) north of
N'Djamena, the capital city, and from there it spread to Lac and Kanem
provinces as well as to N'Djamena. Cases have now been reported in Mongo
and Ati, 2 areas between N'Djamena and Abeche.
A team from the Global Task Force on Cholera Control composed of a public
health specialist and 3 sanitation engineers will work with the Ministry of

organized by international aid agencies and nongovernmental organizations
in eastern Chad, in the areas where refugees from Darfur are present.

Cholera kills 90 in Guinea
---------------------------
At least 90 people have been killed and over 700 new cases reported in a
cholera outbreak in Guinea, Xinhua reports. The epidemic started in Jun
2004 in the western Boke and southwestern Kindia regions with 400 cases.
The Red Cross had donated $10 000 for anti-cholera drugs and Unicef
provided $22 000 as emergency aid to the African nation, it said quoting
Guinean Health Minister Amara Cisse Fri, 24 Sep 2004.
Field medical centers had been set up in cholera-hit areas and the
patients' houses had been sterilized against the deadly disease, the
minister said.
[Cholera is generally spread by contaminated water or food; so
sterilization of houses -- unless it includes the water supply and food --
is not likely to be effective. - Mod.LL]
