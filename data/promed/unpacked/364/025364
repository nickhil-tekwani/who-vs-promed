1. Overview:
Since the start of the African swine fever [ASF] event in Germany in September 2020 and as of 8 Jun 2022, the following ASF outbreaks have been recorded:

Brandenburg: 2544 wild boar, 3 domestic pig farms
Saxony: 1375 wild boar, 0 domestic pig farms
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania: 35 wild boar, 1 domestic pig farm
Baden-Wurttemberg: 0 wild boar, 1 domestic pig farm

2. ASF outbreak on a domestic pig farm in Baden-Wurttemberg
Timeline
19 May 2022: 1 dead animal (n=34)
20 May 2022: 2 dead animals (n=32). Carcasses sent to regional laboratory.
21 May 2022: 11 dead animals (n=21)
24 May 2022: 2 dead animals (n=19). Regional laboratory ASF positive; samples sent to NRL; movement prohibition on the holding.
Start of epidemiological investigations
25 May 2022: culling of remaining animals (n=19)
NRL: confirmation ASF positive
Establishment of restricted zones (protection and surveillance zones)
Start of 1st cleaning, disinfection, and disinfestation (completion 29 May 2022)

3. Epidemiological investigation

a. The farm is composed of a holding and an outdoor keeping. It is a producer of asparagus, strawberries...

The harvesters are mostly from Rumania, Poland, Ukraine. Accommodation of harvesters 1600 m [5250 ft, approx. 1 mi] from the outdoor holding. No livestock in direct vicinity.

b. Preliminary gene sequencing, performed by NRL (FLI, 30 May 2022): no similarities to virus subtypes found in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Brandenburg, or Saxony

c. Short summary of the epidemiological investigation:

- Wild boar carcasses: ASF negative
- Contact establishment: ASF negative
- Epidemiological investigation still ongoing: contaminated food?

[According to the above preliminary findings of the epidemiological investigation, revealing absence of cases in regional wild boar, and in particular the results of the gene sequencing, the occurrence of ASF in a single farm in southwest Germany, distant from the 3 infected German states in the northeast, is not a leap from these states. It may be due to contaminated food. Further information, including results of tests to try to identify similarities of the virus strain to ASF strains from other countries, is anticipated with interest.

The outbreak is situated 6.5 km [4 mi] from the French border. The subsequent preventive measures undertaken by France are described in the French presentation during the June 2022 meeting of SCoPAFF, available at https://ec.europa.eu/food/system/files/2022-06/reg-com_ahw_20220609_asf_fra.pdf. - Mod.AS
