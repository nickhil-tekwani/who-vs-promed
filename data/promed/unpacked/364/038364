[A] child who attended Splendour in the Grass is the 3rd meningococcal case. Splendour in the Grass festival patrons and those who have had contact with them are being urged to monitor for symptoms of meningococcal disease after a child became the 3rd reveller to contract the potentially deadly illness.

Although the disease is uncommon, it can be severe and a man from Sydney, aged in his 40s, who attended the festival died of meningococcal [disease].

"We are urging people and their close contacts who attended the event in the North Byron Parklands on 21-24 Jul 2022 to be alert to the symptoms of meningococcal disease and act immediately if they appear," NSW Health said in a statement issued on Friday [12 Aug 2022].

So far this year [2022] there have been 17 cases of meningococcal disease reported in New South Wales (NSW). Five to 10% of patients with meningococcal disease die, even despite rapid treatment, NSW Health says. The lowest rates of childhood vaccination against the disease are in the area where the festival was held.

Symptoms of the disease include a sudden fever, headache, neck stiffness, joint pain, a rash of red spots or bruises, a dislike of bright lights, nausea and vomiting, but not all the symptoms may be present at once. Children under 5 and 15- to 25-year-olds are at the greatest risk of contracting the disease. Symptoms in young children include irritability, difficulty walking, high-pitched crying and refusing food.

People can carry meningococcal bacteria in their throats and not have symptoms, but pass it on to close contacts.

For more information on vaccination or symptoms, transmission, risks and treatment of meningococcal, go to the NSW Health website.

Authorities have told people who attended Splendour in the Grass to be on alert for symptoms of meningococcal disease, after reporting that one man who attended the festival had since died of the disease. Two cases of meningococcal [disease] have been confirmed in people who attended the Byron Bay music festival, including the man in his 40s from Sydney, who died this week.

New South Wales Health announced the man's death on Friday [5 Aug 2022], and issued a public health alert late on Friday night urging anyone who attended the event in the North Byron Parklands between 21 and 24 Jul 2022 to monitor themselves for symptoms. "Although the disease is uncommon, it can be severe," the authority warned.

The festival said it had notified volunteers and staff of the health alert and was "working on communicating the information" to all attenders. "Splendour in the Grass organisers are working closely with NSW Health authorities," a spokesperson said. In a statement, NSW Health said the man's infection was identified after his death and notified to authorities on Thursday [4 Aug 2022].

In an email to event volunteers, seen by Guardian Australia, organisers of the festival said: "The risk to other staff and festival patrons is low. We don't want to alarm anyone but we do have the responsibility to you as our staff to alert you," the email said. It urged anyone with symptoms of the disease -- which include fever, sore joints and muscles, nausea and vomiting, headache, neck stiffness, discomfort looking at bright light, a rash, leg pain, and cold extremities -- to immediately see a doctor or go to hospital. "People who have had close contact with the 2 meningococcal cases will be offered antibiotics to prevent further spread," the email said.

Bacteria can spread between people who have had extended close contact, while symptoms can take up to a week to develop. Children may have less specific symptoms, including irritability, difficulty walking, high-pitched crying and refusal to eat.

There have been 15 cases of the disease reported in NSW this year [2022]. "While meningococcal disease is now uncommon thanks to vaccination, it can occur year round," NSW Health said. "We tend to see increases in late winter and early spring, with children under 5 and 15- to 25-year-olds at the greatest risk of contracting the disease. Vaccination is the best way to protect yourself, your loved ones and community from the harmful effects of meningococcal disease." While rare, up to one in 10 cases die from the disease and 4 in 10 result in permanent disabilities. Most Australians are vaccinated for meningococcal as babies or children.

The executive director of health protection NSW, Dr Jeremy McAnulty, said early intervention could be lifesaving. "Onset of meningococcal disease symptoms can appear suddenly and become very serious very quickly," he said. "If you suspect meningococcal disease, don't wait for the rash -- see a doctor immediately."

There were 3 deaths from meningococcal last year [2021]. In July [2022?], a 2-year-old from South Australia died after contracting the disease.

[Splendour in the Grass, an annual Australian music festival held at the North Byron Parklands in Yelgun, New South Wales, was held this year 22-24 Jul 2022. North Byron Parklands is a 660-acre cultural arts and music events venue located at Yelgun, a valley in Byron Shire, northeastern New South Wales, 770 km (478 mi) north of Sydney (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yelgun,_New_South_Wales). A map showing the location of Yelgun can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Yelgun+NSW+2483,+Australia/Sydney,+New+South+Wales,+Australia.

The capacity for this year's festival was increased from 35 000 to 50 000 patrons (https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-07-25/splendour-location-and-capacity-in-question-amid-controversy/101265644). Thousands of patrons camp on-site at the festival, while others book accommodations in nearby towns. The 1st day (22 Jul 2022) was cancelled due to torrential rain and flooding; some on-site camping areas were flooded on Thursday (21 Jul 2022) night, while other festival-goers were reported to have waited after the concert was over for up to 6 hours in crowded and muddy lines for shuttle buses to take them to their offsite accommodations on Saturday (23 Jul 2022; https://www.smh.com.au/culture/music/festival-attendees-forced-to-wait-overnight-for-buses-in-crowded-muddy-lines-20220724-p5b42d.html). Campers and cars had to be jump-started and towed out of the mud after the festival was over (https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-07-25/splendour-location-and-capacity-in-question-amid-controversy/101265644).

On 6 Aug 2022, ProMED posted a report of the death of a man in his 40s from Sydney with the meningococcal disease (ProMED post Meningitis, meningococcal - Australia (05): (NS) fatal, RFI 20220806.8704895). We were not told of the meningococcal serogroup involved or epidemiologic linkage to other cases. The 2nd news report above, however, informs us that the man in his 40s from Sydney attended the Splendour in the Grass music festival, as did another person who developed meningococcal disease. The 1st news report above now informs us that a 3rd person who attended Splendour in the Grass developed meningococcal disease. No further information is given about patient characteristics, epidemiologic linkages (other than having attended the music festival), or the serogroup(s) involved.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that:
"All cases of meningococcal disease of the same serogroup should be included in the outbreak case count unless molecular typing indicates that the strain from a case is genetically different than the predominant outbreak strain. In outbreaks with well-defined risk groups, probable cases may be included as outbreak-associated even if they are unable to be confirmed or serogrouped.

"The outbreak threshold for vaccine decision-making should be determined on a case-by-case basis, using the following general guidance:
- Organization-based outbreak: 2-3 outbreak-associated cases within an organization during a 3-month period
- Community-based outbreak: Multiple outbreak-associated cases with an incidence of meningococcal disease that is above the expected incidence in a community during a 3-month period" (https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/downloads/meningococcal-outbreak-guidance.pdf).

More information from knowledgeable sources concerning these cases of invasive meningococcal disease in NSW would be appreciated. - Mod.ML
