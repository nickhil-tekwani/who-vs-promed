Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Started: 12 Aug 2021
Confirmed: 25 Sep 2021
Reported: 27 Sep 2021
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence in the country
Causal agent: _Aethina tumida_
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory
This event pertains to the whole country.

Outbreak location: Village La Union Itza, La Libertad, Peten
Started: 12 Aug 2021
Epidemiological unit: apiary
Total animals affected:
Species / Measures unit / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Bees / hive / 123 / 3 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: Origin unknown so far. The movement of beehives in border areas is suspected to be the cause. Active surveillance: placement of traps to capture and eliminate beetles, prohibition of the movement of beehives and their products within the department of Peten and to other departments of Guatemala, continued training of local and national beekeepers in good beekeeping production practices and strengthening of trapping. Nature of the diagnosis: clinical and morphological by stereoscope in a laboratory. Morphological analysis by stereoscope in animal health laboratory, located in departmental headquarters, MAGA-Peten.

Control measures at event level:
Domestic control measures applied in domestic: disinfestation, surveillance within containment and/or the protection zone

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Laboratorio de diagnostico zoosanitario MAGA, Peten National Laboratory
Species / Test / Outbreaks / Test date / Result
Bees / colony morphology / 1 / 25 Aug 2021 / positive

["The small hive beetle, _Aethina tumida_ Murray 1867 (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae), is a parasite and predator of honeybees. Adults and larvae of small hive beetles feed on honeybee brood, honey and pollen. While feeding on food stores the remaining honey is fermenting and the comb is destroyed. The beetles can promote structural collapse of the nest and cause the adult honeybees to abscond from severely infested colonies. The extent of beetle-associated damage depends on climate, colony strength, and other conditions. Small hive beetles tend to be more problematic in areas with warm temperatures and high humidity. The small hive beetle can be a serious problem in honey-extracting facilities where stored comb, honey, and wax cappings are potential feeding and breeding areas. Beetle development from egg to adult requires 3-12 weeks, depending on humidity, temperature, and food availability. The flying adult beetles actively infest honeybee colonies of all strengths and sizes.

"An infestation by the small hive beetle can be recognised either indirectly via colony-wide damage associated with the beetle or directly via eggs, larvae, and adults. An early diagnosis can be made after opening the colony and finding adult beetles under the colony lid, on the bottom board, or hiding in the combs (especially peripheral combs). Definitive diagnosis at the laboratory is based on morphological examination under a stereomicroscope. Confirmatory testing can be done by real-time polymerase chain reaction.

"Serological tests are not applicable.

"No vaccines are available."

"The beetle is native to Africa, but was introduced to the US (1996), Canada (2002), Australia (2002), Jamaica (2005), Mexico (2007), Cuba (2012), Salvador (2013), Nicaragua (2014), Costa Rica (2015), and Belize (2016) mainly by commercial movement of bees."
