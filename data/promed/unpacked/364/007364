*** 3 children from 2 households became [ill from _E. coli_. ***
Federal food safety inspectors are advising Kroger shoppers in 5
states to check the meat in their freezers. If there's a package of
ground beef or pork marked with the sell-by date of June 1 or June 2
[2001 and the number "86G," take it back to the store - it could be
contaminated with potentially deadly _E. coli_ bacteria. The packaged
meat was sold between 23 May 2001 and 2 Jun 2001 specifically at
Kroger stores in Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, Kentucky, and
Tennessee.
"Although none of the product would be left in the meat case at
stores, some consumers may have stored it in their freezer," Excel
President Bill Buckner said in a statement. "We urge consumers to
check their freezers to see if they have any of the potentially
affected product. Excel takes its responsibility for food safety
seriously, and we want to be sure none of the potentially affected
product remains with the consumer."
Health officials in Georgia notified the USDA last week about the
potential contamination, after 3 children from 2 households became
[ill from _E. coli_. All 3 patients reported eating Kroger-bought
beef in the days leading up to their illness, said Dr. Susan
Lance-Parker, director of the Georgia health department's notifiable
disease and epidemiology section.
Samples of the suspect meat, obtained from one household's freezer,
were taken Wednesday for testing at an Atlanta lab. When the test
results came back positive for _E. coli_ Sunday afternoon, Excel
initiated the recall. Spokesman Mark Klein said it's the first recall
in the Wichita, Kansas-based company's history.
There have been no related reports of _E. coli_[-related illness in
Alabama, state epidemiologist Dr. J.P. Lofgren said. Alabama averages
about 10 cases of _E. coli_ infection each year, but those are usually
isolated incidents, and the state has never experienced an outbreak,
Longren said.
Most [illnesses resulting from the bacteria have come from eating
undercooked [infected ground beef, but it can also occur after
drinking unpasteurized milk or sewage-tainted water. Infection often
causes bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Usually little or no
fever is present, and the illness lasts 5 to 10 days.
Young children, the elderly and those with weakened immune systems are
most susceptible to get sick from _E. coli_. In some cases, the
infection develops into hemolytic uremic syndrome, which destroys red
blood cells and causes kidney failure.
