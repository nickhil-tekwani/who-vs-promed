A comment on: Influenza (15): (Guatemala) bat, novel A lineage 20120228.1055191
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A CDC press release e-mailed to reporters stated that: "Suxiang Tong, PhD, the study's lead author and head of the pathogen discovery program in the CDC's division of viral diseases, said that this discovery marks the 1st identification of an influenza virus in bats. "The study is important, because the research has identified a new animal species that may act as a source of flu viruses."

In fact in spite of what CDC stated an influenza virus has been isolated from bats, see the following:

Isolation of strains of the Hong Kong complex (H3N2) influenza virus from _Nyctalus noctula_ bats in Kazakhstan].

Vopr Virusol. 1979 Jul-Aug;(4):338-41. (In Russian; cited in: Calisher, C.H., Childs, J.E., Field, H.E., Holmes, K.V., Schountz, T. Bats: important reservoir hosts of emerging viruses. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 19:531-545, 2006.)

Abstract: "Four antigenically related hemagglutinating agents were isolated from pools of lungs and tracheas of _Nyctalus noctula_ bats in chick embryos. Identification of the isolates by the hemagglutination inhibition, neuraminidase activity inhibition and double immunodiffusion methods revealed close antigenic relationships with A/Port Chalmers/73 virus."
