Warning on blackleg incidence in Scotland
-------------------------------------------
Vets at the Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) are warning farmers about a rise in the incidence of blackleg (_Clostridium chauvoei_) in cattle after the bacterial disease was diagnosed recently in 5 of its disease surveillance centres in Scotland, namely St Boswells, Ayr, Dumfries, Edinburgh, and Perth. All 5 areas have been affected by heavy rains and localised flooding in recent months. The SAC says that the recent wet weather may have triggered the increase in cases.

Spores of _C chauvoei_ are able to survive in the soil for several years, activating once they enter an animal's body. Alwyn Jones,
a veterinary investigation officer at the St Boswells' centre, said that it was not unusual to see outbreaks of blackleg during the
warmer months of the year: 'Cattle between 6 and 24 months old are particularly susceptible to this disease. Affected cattle
are often found dead, although occasionally they may be lame and have a swollen upper limb before they die. Most bacteria prefer
warmth and at this time of year youngstock are out to grass. Any disturbance of soil in grazing areas could expose clostridial spores and is considered to be a potent trigger factor.

The difficult conditions this year, with high rainfall, have caused plenty of that. Some farms are known to be at particular risk. The SAC notes that the disease can be easily prevented by vaccination and is advising farmers to investigate any unexpected cattle deaths and consult their veterinary surgeon on the need to vaccinate youngstock when out on pasture.
