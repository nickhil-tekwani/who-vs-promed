West Nile disease in Italy, 2013, Epidemiological bulletin No 5, surveillance in equidae
-----------------------------------------------
Monitoring is carried out in equidae by means of periodic examination of sentinel horses, spot checks of resident equidae, and verification of suspected cases of WND.

On 12 Sep 2013, the CESME (National Reference Centre for Exotic Diseases) confirmed 3 clinical outbreaks in the regions of Emilia Romagna and Lombardy. Phylogenetic analyzes carried out on samples of the organs of a horse knocked down made it possible to define the strain as WND-lineage II.

Six clinical WND cases in animals have been reported by Greece, observed between 8-30 Jul 2013, of which 5 cases were in horses (2 in Anatoloki Makedonia, and 3 in Dyitiki Ellada) and one in an unspecified mammal in Attiki).

[According to OIE's WAHID database, during 2012, the following European countries reported WND cases in equidae:

Croatia, July-November 2012, 11 cases;
Greece, July-September, 14 cases;
Spain (Andalucia), unspecified dates, 3 cases.

For further details, select disease, country and year at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail.

Among mammals, disease occurs mainly in equids (horses, donkeys and mules). In WNV endemic regions, preventive vaccination of horses is recommended. For further reading on WNV in animals, please refer to http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/west_nile_fever.pdf. - Mod.AS]

[Given the number of human cases in various parts of Europe this transmission season [2013], it would be surprising if there were not a corresponding number of equine WNV cases as well. - Mod.TY
