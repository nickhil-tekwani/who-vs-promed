If indications are anything to go by, then malaria will not be the only reason to dread mosquitoes, as scientists have discovered that the insects are potential carriers of a mysterious and "poorly understood" new disease.

According to research, the mystery disease causes symptoms similar to many bacterial infections and was often found in cases where doctors registered an illness as "fever of unknown origin."

This was particularly the case in malaria-endemic areas, and in a study, mosquitoes were fed on _Rickettsia felis_ [bacteria]-infected mice, after which it was found that the insects were able to transmit the disease.

The new research by Professor Parola et al builds on _Rickettsia felis_, which was 1st described by experts in 1990 and identified in 2008, as an "emergent global threat for humans." The study appeared in the 8 Jun 2015 issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/06/03/1413835112.short [prepub online on 3 Jun 2015].

Parola said that so little is known about infections of _Rickettsia felis_ in part because it can only be identified by laboratory diagnosis.

[ProMED-mail has reported on infections due to _Rickettsia felis_ in the past (see also's below). The following is extracted from my moderator comments in a prior ProMED-mail post (Murine typhus - USA (CA) 20070816.2677):

"_Rickettsia_ are small obligate intracellular parasites that are maintained in animal and arthropod reservoirs, and transmitted by arthropod vectors (ticks, fleas, lice or mites) to humans. _R. felis_ is the only one of the 12 members of the spotted fever group of rickettsia, which are genetically closely related and are pathogenic for humans, that is flea-borne. All of the other members of the spotted fever group are tick-borne (e.g., _R. rickettsii_, the agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and _R. conorii_, the agent of Indian, Kenya, and Israeli tick typhus, Marseilles fever, and Astrakhan and Mediterranean spotted fever), except _R. akari_, the agent of rickettsialpox, is mouse mite-borne.

"Of the typhus group, _R. prowazekii_, the agent of epidemic typhus is transmitted between humans by the human body louse and the reservoirs are humans and flying squirrels and flying squirrel fleas; and _R. typhi_, the agent of murine typhus, is transmitted by the rat flea and the reservoir is the rat."

"Sero-positivity for _R. typhi_ in opossums and domestic cats associated with human cases of typhus and heavy infestation of the animals with cat fleas, which readily bite humans, suggested these as alternate components of the transmission cycle in suburban environments (Adams WH, et al. Am. J Trop Med Hyg 1970; 19:311-8). _R. typhi_ was also demonstrated by PCR in opossums and cat fleas in urban and suburban areas of Los Angeles. (Williams SG, et al. J Clin Microbiol 1992; 30:1758-62). However, _R. felis_ (formerly called ELB agent) has also been found in cat fleas and opossums in Texas and Southern California in association with human murine typhus cases, and _R. felis_ has been found by PCR in patients with murine typhus-like illness (Schriefer ME, et al. J Clin Microbiol 1994; 54:949-54).

"Murine typhus presents abruptly with chills, fever and headache, accompanied by rash, usually macular or maculopapular, and neurologic involvement in some patients. The illness usually resolves within 3 weeks, even if untreated. However about 10 percent of patients are sick enough to be hospitalized in an intensive care unit and up to 4 percent of hospitalized patients will die from the infection. Treatment is doxycycline. Prevention is directed at control of flea vectors and animal reservoirs, as outlined in the above news report."

In a review article, P. Parola has reported that _R. felis_ has been found by molecular assays in a variety of flea species from more than 20 countries on 5 continents (1). In addition, _R. felis_ has been found in several tick species; in chiggers (the larvae of a certain type of mite); and mites (1).

The reported hosts for these vectors were mainly cats, dogs and rodents, and more rarely opossums, hedgehogs, horses, sheep, goats, gerbils and monkeys (1). However, the cat flea _Ctenocephalides felis_ is the only known biologic vector for _R. felis_ in humans, and _R. felis_ causes a disseminated infection in _C. felis_ with vertical transmission (transovarial and trans-stadial) (1). The cat flea not only infests cats, but also dogs, opossums, raccoons and rats and is found commonly in human homes, where it can bite people (1). In this article (1), Parola suggests that _R. felis_ may also be an underappreciated cause of acute febrile illnesses not caused by malaria in Africa, based on data from 2 studies, one in Kenya (2) and another in Senegal (3).

Parola, according to the news report above, has now added mosquitoes to the list of _R. felis_-infected arthropods. However, _R. felis_ has previously been cultured in mosquito cell lines derived from _Anopheles gambiae_ and _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes (1), and in 2012, Socolovschi et al reported that they found 3 (3.1 percent) of the 96 wild-caught human-landing homogenized (abdomen, wings, legs) _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes from 4 sites in Libreville, Gabon were positive for _R. felis_ DNA, whereas all _Aedes aegypti_ homogenates were negative for _R. felis_ DNA (4). As pointed out by Socolovschi et al (4), though, to confirm mosquitoes as a competent vector for _R. felis_ requires demonstration of the ability of the mosquito to acquire, maintain, and transmit _R. felis_ to humans. The news report above fails to say whether this has been done.
