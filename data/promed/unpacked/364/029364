Increase in parvovirus infections in the Netherlands and management of
exposed pregnant women
Surveillance data from Dutch virological laboratories show that more
infections with parvovirus were reported in the first 24 weeks of 1998 than
in corresponding periods of preceding years (1998: 159; 1997: 79; 1996:
28). An increasing number of enquiries about parvovirus B19 from district
public health services prompted the Dutch National Coordination Centre for
Infectious Diseases to review data since 1992 and a cyclical pattern is
apparent (see figure). Diagnostic procedures and reporting methods have
changed during this time. More laboratories have begun to perform the tests
themselves, and the numbers of diagnostic tests and positive results have
therefore increased. A rise in the incidence of parvovirus infections has
been observed this year in other European countries as well, where
parvovirus infections also follow a cyclical epidemiological pattern. In
England and Wales there is a four year epidemic cycle, while elsewhere
these cyclic periods may be longer.
Although understanding of parvovirus and the consequences of intrauterine
infection for the fetus are increasing there is still insufficient evidence
for effective preventive measures. Pregnant women who may have been in
contact with infected people during the first half of their pregnancy could
be tested serologically after the benefits and drawbacks of testing have
been discussed with them. In general the period of greatest risk of
transmission to the pregnant woman within a family or institution has
already occurred by the time the diagnosis is confirmed. The advice to
exposed pregnant women in the Netherlands who may be susceptible is usually
to wait and see whether illness occurs - characteristic rash, joint pains
and swelling, after which the diagnosis can be confirmed by serology. If
infection occurs in the first half of pregnancy there is a 9% risk of
intrauterine death and a lower risk of fetal hydrops, which may develop at
any stage in the rest of the pregnancy. Since fetal hydrops is treatable,
the woman should be referred to an obstetrician for follow-up and treatment
if necessary. There is no evidence that intrauterine infection leads to
congenital malformations and no reason to consider terminating the
pregnancy.
In the case of occupational exposure other arguments prevail. The employer
has an obligation to protect the employee and the pregnancy against
exposure to biological agents. In the case of an outbreak in a healthcare
institution, daycare centre or school, in the Netherlands it is recommended
to temporarily transfer susceptible pregnant employees away from where
cases are occurring.
In the UK there is concern that following the decline of rubella,
parvovirus B19 is among the most important viral infections in pregnancy.
Asymptomatic infections are common and these present the same risk to the
fetus as symptomatic infections. Transferring pregnant employees away from
workplaces where cases are occurring may not reduce the risk to the
employee since most infections are probably acquired in the community and
workplace outbreaks are usually a reflection of the community situation.
The Public Health Laboratory Service has drafted new guidelines -
(available from Natasha Crowcroft (ncrowcro@phls.co.uk)) for prevention of
parvovirus B19 infection in healthcare settings and the community which are
currently out for consultation. The guidelines propose a more active
approach to the diagnosis of infections in pregnancy, the detection of
fetal hydrops and prevention of fetal loss in pregnant women. The proposed
interventions are different from current practice in the Netherlands and
should be a focus for debate within the European Union.
