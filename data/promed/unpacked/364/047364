I have been following the unfolding of the West Nile saga in New York with
fascination. Can you clarify a couple of points:
a) Is it now [thought that the entire outbreak was due to West Nile virus?
Were there no cases of SLE or was it a mixed outbreak of WNV and SLE?
b) As someone who has studied outbreaks of Japanese encephalitis in Sri
Lanka, I was under the impression that for a significant outbreak of these
viruses to occur, one has to have pretty high vector densities. What is the
putative vector in this outbreak, where does it breed, and how can vector
densities sufficent to trigger an outbreak of this magnitude (given usual
case: asymptomatic infection ratios for these viruses, thousands of humans
have probably been infected) occur in a location as "built up" as New York?
I must confess, I have no first hand experience with New York! I am asking
this question as someone in another "built up" area, Hong Kong, where
arboviruses, have of late, not been a problem. Maybe we should not be
complacent?

[Malik is a former student of James Porterfield and has extensive experience
with arboviruses, influenza A in the recent Hong Kong scare, enteroviruses,
and many other viruses. His questions includethose we all would like to
have answered.
As best I can tell from all these reports, newspaper articles, murmurs, and
telephone calls, no one has identified St. Louis encephalitis virus
infection in humans or birds in the New York City area and no virus has been
identified as St. Louis encephalitis virus.
Apparently, the first virus isolates that have been obtained were from
birds by USDA, which sent them to CDC for identification.
I have seen no data on vector densities. The putative vector in this
outbreak seems to be _Culex pipiens_ complex mosquitoes. If the vector
densities required for this outbreak to be recognized were exceedingly high,
surely someone in NY City and surrounding areas would have noticed. New
Yorkers complain about little problems, not big ones.
Complacency is never a good idea. Hong Kong, a great port city, remains
ripe for invasion by an exotic (to Hong Kong) virus. - Mod.CHC
