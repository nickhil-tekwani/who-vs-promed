The Ministry of Agriculture has confirmed a new case of Xylella fastidiosa on the Costa Blanca, affecting 20 plots in Alicante Province [Valencia Autonomous Community). It was previously confined to [Marina Baixa region], where emergency action has been taken, but it then spread to almond orchards in [the regions of] El Comtat and [Marina Alta].

In September [2017], the European Commission said that Spain is "losing the battle" against the disease that is "officially out of control". European Union regulations dictate: "Strict eradication measures apply, consisting in a clear cut of all host plants of the specific subspecies of _Xylella fastidiosa_, irrespective of their health status, in a radius of 100 m around the infected plants."

Regional Secretary of Agriculture Fracisco Rodriguez has confirmed [a] compensation plan for farmers.

[_Xylella fastidiosa_ (Xf) clogs the xylem of plants leading to wilting, necrosis and often death. It causes many serious crop diseases such as Pierce's disease of grapevine; leaf scorch of coffee, almond and olive; peach phony disease; plum leaf scald; citrus variegated chlorosis; lucerne dwarf; leaf scorch of a range of other woody species. Latent infections of wild species as potential pathogen reservoirs have also been reported. While all strains of _Xylella_ have been classified into a single species, several subspecies have been proposed and more research is needed to determine their host range and risks to crops.

Xf is spread by xylem-feeding insects, but also by grafting and with infected plant material. It is not seed borne. Moist conditions favour the vectors and therefore Xf-associated diseases. Disease management is difficult due to the large numbers of hosts and vectors and may include use of clean planting and grafting material, as well as vector control. Both the bacterium and its main vectors are of serious quarantine concern.

Xf had previously been reported mainly from the Americas. In 2013, it was reported in olives from Italy (ProMED-mail posts 20131101.2033095, 20140820.2708739, and 20140424.2425497). That outbreak was thought to likely represent the first appearance of Xf in the European region due to contaminated imports of plant material.

However, the detection of multiple subspecies in a diversity of hosts, including some asymptomatic ornamentals acting as reservoir host, subsequently suggested that some Xf strains had to have been present in the region for a considerable amount of time, in order to be able to affect a multitude of local hosts. Xf is currently considered the most serious phytosanitary threat to European grape and fruit production and the pathogen has been added to the A1 quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

For Spain, the Balearic Islands were the site for the 1st reports of Xf in the country, on cherry (ProMED-mail post 20161125.4653479), as well as for the grapevine strain (ProMED-mail post 20161208.4685744). However, it has since become clear that earlier reports of 'wood decay fungus' killing almond trees in the country (ProMED-mail posts 20091022.3630 & 20110907.2728) were in fact misdiagnosed outbreaks of Xf. Unfortunately, lack of diligence in "diagnosing" an unknown plant disease prevented early eradication responses and thus has resulted in disastrous crop losses in Spain.
