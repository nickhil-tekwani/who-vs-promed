Debilitating skin disease in Blue Sheep (_Pseudois nayaur_) in
Khunjerab National Park, Northern Area, Pakistan
-----------------------------------------------
In early December 1996, a Shimshali yak herder noticed that the wild
Blue sheep, which share high altitude winter grazings with the
Shimshali herd of about 1000 yaks, near Sherlik on the
Pakistan-Chinese border, were suffering from a debilitating and often
fatal skin disease.
The Blue sheep is classified as Least Concern in IUCN's Red List [picture at
<http://www.wildsheep.org/sheep/images_international/chinese_blue_400wide.jpg>].
Several visits to this remote area, which is extremely difficult to
access, have been carried out by several experts. Initially, in July
2000 by a Canadian social geographer, Dr. David Butz, who was told
that "many Blue sheep were dying at high altitudes of some as yet
undiagnosed disease." He was further told by Shimshali herdsmen that
they had seen an estimated "several hundred" Blue sheep carcasses on
some of the more remote high altitude meadows near Sherlik during the
early summer of 2000, and that the sick Blue sheep become indifferent
to human approach, that the disease did not appear to be seasonal and
that it affected equally both sexes and all age groups. They
considered that the Blue sheep population, which they estimated to be
around 1500, was declining as a result of the disease. The herdsmen
suspected that the disease had originated several years previously
among the Blue sheep population living across the Shaksgam river in
China, with which there was said to be some seasonal, cross-border
interchange; they were very concerned that the disease would spread
southwards in the Blue sheep population on their side of the
international border and would infect their domestic animals at their
summer settlements, south of the Shimshal Pass.
Dr. Butz was able to take some photographs of affected Blue sheep on
the Pamir and passed his information to the then chairman of the
IUCN/SSC Veterinary Specialist Group, Dr. M.H. Woodford.
Subsequently, Dr. Woodford visited Shimshal village in April 2001;
for a variety of reasons, it was not politically possible at that
time to visit the Shimshali Pamir in order to carry out a diagnostic
investigation. In early 2005, it became possible to arrange for a
sick Blue sheep to be shot by a Shimshali hunter and to be buried in
a glacier to await the arrival on the Pamir of a diagnostic team.
In May 2005, 2 veterinarians (M. Woodford and K. Powell) accompanied
by Dr. David Butz made the difficult 4-day trek from Shimshal village
(10 500 ft asl) to the Blue sheep areas at Arbob Purien, Shuijerab
and beyond (12 500 to 14 000 ft asl). Here, the previously shot Blue
sheep, safely in "deep freeze" in the glacier, was exhumed and
diagnostic specimens collected. The specimens were examined by kind
permission of the National Veterinary Laboratories, Ministry of
Agriculture and Livestock, Government of Pakistan, Islamabad,
assisted by Dr. Qurban Ali; a diagnosis of Sarcoptic mange was made.
Several possible veterinary interventions have since been considered
for the treatment of the wild Blue sheep for their sarcoptic mange
infestation. However, in view of the difficulty of access, the
extremes of altitude and climate and the lack of biodata for the Blue
sheep population, these interventions have initially been postponed.
Eventually, in May 2006, the Shimshali domestic sheep and goats were
injected with ivermectin by a Pakistani veterinarian funded by the
Bill Jordan Foundation for Wildlife. While this treatment was being
carried out, it was reconfirmed that some of the sheep were suffering
from a mange-like skin disease. It is hoped that the Ivermectin
injections will have reduced this infection.
On questioning the older shepherds, it became clear that sarcoptic
mange probably infected the Shimshali domestic livestock before 1996,
when the disease was 1st noticed to be affecting the wild Blue sheep.
If this is the case, the Blue sheep probably acquired their infection
from contact with the domestic livestock on the Pamir rather than
vice-versa, thus indicating that the mange infection has probably
been present in the domestic sheep and goats since prior to 1996.
Since sarcoptic mange in wildlife is often associated with
malnutrition, it is now proposed to arrange for an environmental
study of the herbivore carrying capacity (both wild and domestic) on
the high altitude Shimshali Pamirs in the Khunjerab National Park.
Concurrently, the Shimshali herdsmen are being advised to inject
their livestock biannually with ivermectin, an intestinal
parasiticide and sarcopticide. It is hoped that this treatment will
result in a marked improvement in the productivity of the domestic
livestock.
Wild, sympatric Ibex (_Capra ibex sibirica_) do not as yet appear to
be clinically affected.

Sarcoptic Mange (Scabies): In sheep, this condition, caused by
_Sarcoptes scabiei var ovis_, is rare (reportable in the USA). It
affects the non wooly skin, usually starting on the head and face. In
goats, _S scabiei var caprae_ is responsible for a generalized skin
condition characterized by marked hyperkeratosis. Lesions start
usually on the head and neck. The causative mite should be
differentiated from _Psoroptes ovis_ infestation, a reportable
disease in many countries (including the USA), characterized by
large, scaly, crusted lesions which develop almost exclusively on
wooly parts of the body. Intense pruritus manifests by biting and
scratching. Left untreated, sheep often become emaciated and anemic.
In cattle, Sarcoptic mange is a very contagious disease, spread by
direct contact or indirectly by fomites. The causative mite,
_Sarcoptes scabiei var bovis_ , can be transmitted to humans and is a
reportable disease. Lesions start on the head, neck, and shoulders
and can spread to other parts of the body; pruritus is intense.
Papules develop into crusts, and the skin thickens and forms large
folds. The whole body may be involved in 6 weeks. Diagnosis is made
by deep skin scrapings, skin biopsy, or response to therapy. All the
said mites should respond to ivermectin. - Mod.AS]
