Doctors have warned of the growing public health threat of edible cannabis to children after a hospital in Dublin reported 6 cases of young children being accidentally poisoned with the drug over an 8-week period earlier this year [2021].

A new study [see citation below] said there was an increase in cases of children under the age of 10 suffering from acute encephalopathy -- a disease that affects the brain -- as well as respiratory depression or hypotension linked to accidental use of cannabis products.

The study, which is published in the latest edition of the Irish Medical Journal, documents the cases of 6 children -- 5 under the age of 6 -- who presented in the emergency department of Temple Street Children's Hospital in Dublin with acute encephalopathy and also tested positive for THC [tetrahydrocannabinol], the main active ingredient in cannabis.

All cases occurred over an 8-week period dating from 17 Mar 2021, with one child suffering a seizure.

Researchers said it was the 1st series of paediatric cannabis poisoning reported in Ireland.

The report revealed that 2 children were discharged after 12 hours from the emergency department, while 4 were admitted to a ward, with one child requiring treatment in the hospital's intensive care unit.

All 6 cases were reported to Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.

One case involving 2 siblings aged 3 and 4 occurred after they consumed cannabis jellies known as Chuckles Peach Rings, which were in a schoolbag in a communal space. Each jelly had 50 mg of THC.

The older child needed to be transferred to the hospital's intensive care unit requiring oxygen to assist with their breathing. The patient was eventually discharged after 3.5 days in hospital.

The other sibling was treated in a hospital ward where 3 incidents of their lips turning blue were recorded.

Both Tusla and gardai were notified about the 2 cases.

Another child, aged 10, was hospitalised after consuming his 26-year-old sibling's cannabis sweets, which left him dizzy and ataxic, a condition leaving someone with abnormal, uncoordinated movements.

The study said the potency of edible cannabis products varies due to false labelling of products from unregulated sources. It noted the amount ingested from edible cannabis products can be 10 to 50 times the average dose of 5-20 mg of THC inhaled by an adult smoking or vaping.

"The delayed effect from oral ingestion compared to rapid effects from smoking or vaping is what poses the greatest risk to children and naive users who consume several edibles initially then overdose," the study observed.

Doctors said edible cannabis products could act as either a stimulant, hallucinogenic, or sedative on young children.

The younger patients in the study exhibited dilated pupils and altered sensorium.

The study said the 6 cases pointed to an emerging problem that has also been present in other jurisdictions where cannabis use had been decriminalised or under-enforced. It pointed out that edible cannabis products are attractively presented and not in childproof packaging.

"These products have uncontrolled concentrations of THC, as they are largely made illegally and often supplied through the internet," it added.

"This is a serious evolving pediatric public health threat with child protection issues," the study concluded.

Likely this problem is happening in other locations as well.

Cannabis products often contain THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, a hallucinogen. This product is usually eaten, and the effects can occur from 1-3, or possibly more, hours after eating the product, the delay partly determined by the amount of edible product ingested, the size of the individual, and whether there is any other food in the stomach. These factors affect when the cannabis effects are felt. Consequently, with the effects delayed, it is easy to consume more of the product. This is especially detrimental to children and pets. Edible cannabis can have effects lasting a long time and can reach concentrations much higher than smoking the cannabis. This high concentration is much more dangerous to children and pets.

Edibles are mistakenly thought to be safer, especially around children and pets, which is certainly not the case. Effects of cannabis in children and pets can last for up to 12 hours or longer depending on the size of the individual and the amount ingested.

Good quality controls on many edibles are often lacking, as the THC dose can vary wildly from candy to candy or brownie to brownie, and certainly between packages.

When an edible THC product has been ingested, signs of a possible overdose may include the following:

- Impaired motor skills or lack of control of muscles
- Anxiety or even agitation (which can be severe)
- Extreme confusion
- Rapid heart rate
- Paranoid behavior
- Panic
- Elevation in blood pressure
- Severe nausea and/or vomiting
- Delusions and/or hallucinations

THC edibles that look like candy are often tempting to children and pets. Users of this form of THC should be especially careful to keep the product out of reach of any child or pet.

There are also edible CBD (cannabidiol) products, which do not contain THC, the hallucinogenic form of the marijuana plant. These are less dangerous and have been proven useful for pain control without the negative side effects of THC. If you should choose to go this route, seek a reputable company who has their products routinely tested to ensure there's no THC. - Mod.TG
