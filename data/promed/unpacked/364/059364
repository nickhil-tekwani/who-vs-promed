_Bonamia ostreae_ in Canada
-------------------------------
(Disease never reported before in Canada)
Emergency report
Information received on 9 Dec 2004 from Dr. Brian Evans, Executive
Director, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Ottawa
Date of the report: 9 Dec 2004
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 7 Nov 2004
Estimated date of primary infection: under investigation
Outbreaks:
Location:
Province of British Columbia, Malaspina Inlet (on the west coast of the
mainland)
Number of outbreaks: one shellfish farm
Description of affected population: 3 to 4-year-old oysters
Diagnosis:
On 4 Dec 2004, the Fisheries and Oceans Canada Shellfish Health Laboratory
in Nanaimo reported the histological observation of the parasite in tissue
samples. Based on further analysis by PCR(1) assays, gene sequencing, and
restriction digest (RFLP), a diagnosis of the suspicion of _Bonamia_ was made.
This finding was confirmed by the OIE Reference Laboratory for Diseases of
Molluscs, (IFREMER), in La Tremblade, France.
Source of agent / origin of infection: under investigation
Epidemiological details:
The shellfish farm was investigated due to a heavy die off at the grower
site in November 2004.
Control measures:
- Plans to control the spread of the disease are ongoing.
- Quarantine (except for direct human consumption)
- The industry and provincial veterinary organizations are being informed,
and a surveillance program enhanced, to ensure early detection.

[This parasitic disease, also known as "Hemocyte disease of flat oysters,"
has been reported in Europe and on both coasts of the United States. Its
impact can be serious, as evidenced by a drop in French oyster production
of almost 90 percent in 1995. Some infected oysters may appear to be
healthy; others will show yellow discoloration and/or extensive lesions
(i.e. perforated ulcers) in the connective tissues of the gills, mantle,
and digestive gland. Pathology results from hemocyte destruction and
diapedesis due to proliferation of the parasite. Although this is the 1st
report in Canada, Fisheries and Oceans Canada has a very informative
summary of the disease at
