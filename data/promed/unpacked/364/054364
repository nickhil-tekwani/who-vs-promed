The secretary of Health of Ribeirao Claro, Ana Maria Baggio, said today, 26 Jan 2015, the 12-year-old girl who died on 14 Jan 2015 at the University Hospital of Maringa with suspected dengue hemorrhagic fever, in fact may have been the victim of spotted fever, transmitted by a species of tick (mainly _Amblyomma cajennense_), very common in wild animals such as the capybara.

Ana Baggio said that the examinations to prove the cause of death ruled out death by dengue hemorrhagic fever. According to the secretary of Health, since the suspicion, she has been in contact with the 14th Regional Health, in Paranavai. Before becoming ill, the girl had spent some days in Ribeirao Claro, visiting a sister who lives in the countryside. She had also spent a whole day near the edge of a dam on a rural property.

The girl lived in San Carlos do Ivai (98 kilometers [61 miles] from Maringa) and was the daughter of a couple of cutters of sugarcane in a plant located in the city. According to family, she was ill that week, with severe pain in the region of the stomach, and high fever. The girl was treated at Hospital of Our Lady of Grace, but in the face of the severity of the case, the doctors have chosen to transfer her to the University Hospital, where she died a few hours after entering the unit.

[The Rocky Mountain spotted fever rickettsia, _Rickettsia rickettsii_, is the cause of this illness, which is also referred to as febre maculosa, Sao Paulo exanthematic typhus, Minas Gerais exanthematic typhus, and Brazilian spotted fever. The organism, which is tickborne, is distributed through much of the USA, including the Rocky Mountains, and also in parts of southern Canada and Central and South America. It is vital to diagnose this rickettsial infection promptly to minimize morbidity and mortality.

When the female tick harboring the organism attaches to a passing human, she usually starts low on the body after transferring from grassy vegetation or even directly or indirectly from a dog. After crawling around on clothes seeking an appropriate cutaneous site (wearing white clothes makes a wandering tick easier to spot), she attaches and begins to feed.

If not already partially fed, after attaching, it generally takes 24 hours to activate and transmit the rickettsial organism. For this reason, daily or twice daily tick checks with removal will minimize disease transmission. Ticks that attach in hairy areas such as the scalp or beard may be more difficult to find.

The incubation period of the disease is about a week after the tick exposure, long after the tick has detached. The presenting illness is generally nonspecific, with fever, muscle pains, and headache (but the headache is usually described as quite severe). The rash begins in day 3 of illness, initially maculopapular [a flat rash with small raised bumps] at the wrists and ankles before becoming petechial and purpuric [small and larger red or purple spots caused by bleeding under the skin], involving the palms and soles as well as spreading proximally to the trunk. Purpura usually are not seen before the 6th day of illness. The mortality is indeed quite low if treatment (usually a tetracycline) is begun during the 1st 2 days of the rash or before.

Empiric treatment for this infection should always be started in people with compatible symptoms inhabiting endemic areas during the spring and summer, even if no tick bite is known.
