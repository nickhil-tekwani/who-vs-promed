Hand, foot & mouth disease: Singapore (update)
---------------------------------------------
More children have come down with hand, foot and mouth disease in Singapore
following last week's death of a boy believed to have contracted the
illness, a government official said on Tue 19 Sep 2000. As of Mon 18 Sep
2000, 165 cases had been reported over the past week in 28 child-care
centres across the Southeast Asian city-state, said Billy Chew, an
Environment Ministry spokesman. The number was up from 122 cases on
Saturday, 107 on Friday and 53 on Thursday. At least 58 of the afflicted
children have recovered.

[The virus responsible for this outbreak apparently has yet to be
identified. Enterovirus 71 and Coxsackie virus A16 have been implicated in
previous outbreaks in this region. The disease is not usually
life-threatening, but can sometimes involve potentially fatal
complications. Symptoms include fever, sore throat, and sometimes vesicular
rashes on the hands and feet. The disease can be spread through direct
contact with nasal discharge, saliva, faeces, and fluid from the vesicles.
More than 50 children died in Taiwan during an outbreak of hand, foot and
mouth disease in 1998, and 30 in the Malaysian state of Sarawak on Borneo
island in 1997. - Mod.CP ..........................cp/es
