Low pathogenic (LP) avian influenza H5N2 has been detected in a mixed,
medium-sized poultry farm with free-range ducks and geese in the north east
of Germany. Active virus infections were confirmed after initial detection
of H5-seropositive ducks in the frame of routine monitoring activities.

The outbreak occurs at a time of unusually high prevalence of LP H5
infections in wild anatids in Germany. Since early October 2010, LP H5 is,
next to H3, the most frequently encountered avian influenza virus (AIV)
subtype seen in the migrating wild bird population throughout the country.
A genetically very closely related H5N2 virus has also been detected in a
flock of sentinel mallard ducks kept by the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut at
the Baltic Sea coast. All findings have been made through active monitoring
activities. Neither clinical signs (in affected poultry) nor mortality (in
wild birds and sentinel ducks) have been associated with these infections.

It has previously been shown that active wild bird monitoring has limited
use for detection of highly pathogenic AIV, for which passive monitoring
measures seem more appropriate (Globig et al., 2009). However, the current
situation emphasizes the usefulness also of active monitoring of wild bird
populations as a guiding instrument with respect to the occurrence and
prevalence of notifiable AIV subtypes (H5, H7) and the risk of transmission
to poultry.
