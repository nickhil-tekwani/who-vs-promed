A dangerous tick has appeared in Hungary: it may carry a disease [Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever] with a 30% mortality rate. The tick [has been] found in Budapest, according to Dr István Zoltán Kapiller, veterinarian who specialises in tick infestations.

Organised control of this tick species (_Hyalomma marginatum_) should start as soon as possible at national level. Several specimens have already been found in Budapest, even if no disease has been detected, but it should be noted that this species of tick can only be recognised by a specialist, and even general practitioners are not very good at distinguishing it from other species.

[The tick vector of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHF), _Hyalomma marginatum_, has now been found in Hungary, but without the virus. This tick and the virus have been expanding their geographic range in Europe. Mod.UBA notes that "in the WHO European Region, cases of human CCHF infection have been reported from Albania, Armenia, Bulgaria, Georgia, Greece, Kosovo, Russia, Serbia, Turkey, and Ukraine, as well as Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, with Turkey being the most affected country."

Intensive field surveys are necessary to determine the extent of the presence of this tick in Hungary and if there is evidence of CCHF virus there. If the tick has become established in Hungary, its elimination will be unlikely. - Mod.TY
