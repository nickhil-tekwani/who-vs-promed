ALERT: 6 new Alabama counties positive for Asian soybean rust
-----------------------------------------------
Alabama officials have confirmed that Asian soybean rust (ASR) has been
reported in 6 new counties, doubling its number of infected counties in an
announcement, according to the Georgia state commentary on
<http://www.sbrusa.net>. The new Alabama counties are Coffee, Conecuh,
Dale, Henry, Houston and Pike, all in southeast or south-central Alabama.
Bob Kemerait of the University of Alabama said ASR was confirmed on kudzu
in Conecuh county; in soybean sentinel plots in Coffee and Henry counties;
and in commercial soybean fields in Houston, Dale and Pike counties. ASR
was also detected on kudzu in Pike county. According to Kemerait, ASR was
found in 9 commercial soybean fields, 8 soybean sentinel plots and 4 kudzu
patches in the state.
Houston, Henry, Dale, Coffee and Pike counties are in the southeast region
of the State, while Conecuh County is in south-central Alabama. Infected
soybean fields and sentinel plots ranged in growth stages from R3-R6,
Kemerait said, with relatively low disease incidence and severity.
Alabama ties Georgia with 12 ASR-infected counties each in 2005.

[This sudden burst of ASR was probably anticipated but certainly not what
was expected. The fact that ASR was found in 9 commercial soybean fields is
certainly a wake-up call that might indicate further findings to be
expected in commercial fields in Alabama and other southern states.
