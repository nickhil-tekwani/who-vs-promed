Avian influenza, also known as bird flu, was detected on an organic poultry farm with 24 000 hens in Zeewolde [Flevoland], the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs has reported.

It is likely to be a mild H7 version of the virus [see final diagnosis in commentary], which has no effect on human health. The chickens on the farm still have to be cleared, in accordance with European rules, because a mild variant can mutate into a highly contagious and deadly variant which kills chickens.

From Tuesday (19 March) afternoon, a transport ban of poultry, eggs and poultry manure has been imposed in a 1 km radius around the farm in Zeewolde, Flevoland province. Within this area, there are no other poultry farms.

A week ago, a mild version of bird flu was also found on a poultry farm in Lochem [Gelderland]. It is not yet clear whether both farms have been afflicted by the similar virus.
