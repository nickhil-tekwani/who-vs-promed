I read your posting on drug resistant typhoid fever in Bangalore, which was
interesting, but not surprising. In response to the moderator's comments on
disease confirmation and confirmation of resistance, most laboratories in
South India do the Widal test in addition to culture of blood and stool for
_S. typhi_. Ciprofloxacin resistance in _S. typhi_ in South India has been
reported and characterized in isolates obtained as early as 1994
Reference: Brown JC, Shanahan PM, Jesudason MV, Thomson CJ, Amyes SG, 1996.

[Thanks for the useful insight and the reference to published data. I
would just comment that it was the article quoting an Indian physician that
suggested a problem with some hospitals doing the Widal test without
culture confirmation, not the moderator. - Mod.ES

This is in reference to the Times of India article on Typhoid in Bangalore
city.
In my experience there is nothing new in the report including the suspected
drug resistant cases. In a country where Ciprofloxacin can be bought over
the counter from a pharmacy its not surprising that there are wide spread
drug resistant cases. Doctors who practice in India come from the three
main schools of Allopathic, Homeopathic and Ayurvedic medicine. Though
strictly speaking only the Allopathic doctors should be prescribing
antibiotics, the doctors from the other two branches also do so. In short
anybody and everybody who is allowed to practice (whether legally or
otherwise) writes out a prescription for a drug. Very often this is either
unnecessary as would be when antibiotics are prescribed for viral
infections or inadequate, when the dosage recommendations are not followed,
especially in children where no body weight related dosages are calculated.
This can only result in the outcome that we are seeing today and will
continue until such time that the Medical Council along with the government
can regulate the prescribing habits of doctors and prevent pharmacists from
dispensing to those without prescriptions. This task seems not only
unlikely, but one that would never be possible to implement.
Laboratory investigations are also unlikely to give much information.
Faecal and blood cultures are done only at teaching or private hospitals.
There being no standardization of laboratory techniques the Widal reports
become unreliable. Unfortunately most of the diagnosis is based either on
clinical judgement or on a single Widal report. Few doctors would recommend
repeat Widals to determine the presence of rising titres.
Thus in a country that is riddled with these problems, the true extent of
this particular outbreak will never be fully determined. The State
Government does not have the will, or resources to establish the pattern of
the disease or the problem of drug resistance and we would only have to
rely on the information from doctors working at hospitals like Mallya to
give the rest of us some indication about what is happening. Having said
that I am sure there will always be somebody at one of the hospitals who
will come up with a study that will give us proper microbiological
characterization of anti microbial susceptibility, or of clinical
failures. A number of articles routinely appear in the Indian Medical
Journals and have done so regarding Ciprofloxacin resistant cases. Until
then we will have to rely on media reports about the cases in Bangalore and
around Karnataka state (Banglaore is the capital of Karnataka).
