HANTAVIRUS - AMERICAS (07): COMMENT

In response to the recent ProMED-mail report of hantavirus infections in Panama (Hantavirus - Americas (05): Panama, archive no. 20200514.733374), it remains strange that in the Americas, Seoul virus infection and its related hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (SEOV-HFRS) is apparently never considered, even if the clinical presentation is not hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS), but "hantavirus fever" (alas, without mentioning of renal involvement, such as easy dipstick urine evaluation of proteinuria/microhematuria). This must be, in fact, most probably SEOV-HFRS, but is never proven, except in the USA, where hitherto only 8 cases (whereof 3 already in 1994) were published in the period 1994-2020. The fact that only 8 SEOV-HFRS cases have been reported in the USA in 26 years, despite overwhelming evidence since the early 1990s that SEOV-infected peridomestic rats were found in nearly each American city (1), suggests a serious and continued lower medical awareness.

Very recently, an HFRS case in the USA was reported in Colorado, being initially considered as a mild HCPS, with transient bilateral interstitial infiltrates on chest radiograph, with a high Sin Nombre virus (SNV)-specific IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) titer (1:6.400, norm less than 1:100), but without molecular confirmation by viral sequencing. Nevertheless, the case was reported as being SEOV-induced, since presenting in a farmer with a history of recent rat exposure, and since showing (non-specified) positive IgM results in a commercial ELISA format containing both Old and New World hantaviral antigens. The principal argument, however, was clinical, being the typical self-remitting 2-weeks course with modest acute kidney injury (AKI), but with massive proteinuria, peaking to nephrotic-range levels: spot urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio or uACR of 1576 mg/g (norm less than 30 mg/g) (2). With this case report, the main but often neglected characteristics of SEOV-HFRS were again highlighted, as was the problem of misleading ELISA cross-reactions of SNV antigens, often used in North America for confirmation of an assumed HCPS case (3).

With the growing evidence that SEOV-induced HFRS can also present as an (often milder) "HCPS," also in the Americas, inclusion of a SEOV-antigen in commercial and official ELISA formats seems ever more mandatory.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Clement for his important comments. All laboratories in the Americas should adopt the capability to make differential diagnoses that includes SEOV. Similarly, clinicians attending suspected or confirmed cases of hantavirus infection in the Americas should be aware of the clinical features of SEOV-HFRS such as renal involvement with easy dipstick urine evaluation of proteinuria/microhematuria. Distinguishing between infections of SEOV and other hantaviruses in the Americas is clinically important. SEOV infections are usually milder and of shorter duration. Infections in the Americas with Sin Nombre or Andes viruses can cause HCPS with case fatality rates of 30-40%. Knowing which hantavirus is the epidemiological agent in hantavirus cases in the Americas is epidemiologically important as well. The rodent host of SEOV is wild or domestic brown rats (_Rattus norvegicus_), which are widely distributed in the Americas and around the world. Other hantaviruses in the Americas have native, and often quite restricted, rodent hosts. Strategies for controlling these rodent reservoir hosts are different. Knowing which hantavirus is responsible for these human infections is important. - Mod.TY
