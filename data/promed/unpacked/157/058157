Department of Conservation (DOC) staff are expecting the first results of
tests carried out at Massey University on tissue samples from dead sea
lions soon. DOC sea lion expert Mike Donoghue said tissue samples were
rushed to Rotterdam at the weekend. Testing would be carried out by a group
of scientists, who were [sic experts in sea lion and seal viruses. But it
could still be some time before it was known exactly what had wiped out
almost half of this season's sea lion pup crop, he said.
Meanwhile, cruise liners, which are frequent visitors to the nearby
Campbell Islands, are waiting to see if they can help DOC staff stationed
there. Last week the Minister of Conservation, Nick Smith, closed the
Campbell Islands to visitors until more was known about the sea lion
plague. DOC Southern Islands manager Greg Lind said the cruise ship Kapitan
Klebnikov was is the area and was waiting to see if the crew could help by
taking staff off the islands. He was impressed with the support from cruise
ship operators. "We couldn't ask for better co-operation," Mr Lind said.

The New Zealand sea lion (_Phocarctos hookeri_) was once called the Hookers
sea lion after Sir Joseph Hooker who was the botanist with the British
expedition to Antarctica in 1839. They are unique to New Zealand and exist
nowhere else.
New Zealand sea lions breed only on the subantarctic islands of New
Zealand. Their main breeding colony is on Dundas Island, a small island in
the Auckland Island group about 470 nautical miles south of New Zealand.
Other smaller breeding colonies are on Enderby Island and Figure of Eight
Island in the same group and Campbell Island. Haul out sites, where the sea
lions come shore to rest are more wide spread and are found from Macquarie
Island in the south to Stewart Island, Snares Island, the islands of
Foveaux Strait and the south Otago Coast on New Zealand's South Island. A
few individuals are also seen on some North Island beaches. The northern
haul sites are predominantly used by sub adult males. The average
population was estimated at between 12000 and 16000 prior to a catastrophic
disease outbreak in January 1998. The current population is unknown.
In December each year the bulls fight for territory on the breeding
colonies before the females come ashore. The bulls are larger than the cows
and can weigh as much as 400 kg. The bulls who establish territory are
called Beach masters and will collect a harem of as many females as they
can keep together. The smaller females weighing between 130 kg and 230 kg
come ashore a few weeks after the bulls and give birth to a single pup
sometimes within hours of their arrival. Between a week and ten days later
the cows are mated and will hold the fertilised ovum in suspension for
three months to begin the nine month gestation in time for next year's
short breeding season. The single pups are between 70cm and 100 cm long at
birth, with male pups slightly heavier. They grow quickly on a diet of rich
milk and are introduced to the water very early by their mothers. In a
normal year between 20 percent and 30 per cent of pups will die from a
variety of causes. These range from starvation, if their mothers fail to
return from feeding trips at sea, to being crushed under the weight of
fighting bulls or drowned in mud wallows.
Adult females coats vary from buff to creamy grey while the males are dark
brown to black with heavy manes over well muscled shoulders. Pups are born
with a thick coat of brown hair.
Diet varies from squid and pelagic fish to shellfish and crabs. Adult sea
lions can dive deeper than most other seal species with some dives recorded
at 500 metres.
White pointer sharks and orca target most seal breeding colonies and will
take unwary adults and pups. Some fishing techniques also pose a threat to
sea lions which can get trapped in squid trawl nets and drown.
