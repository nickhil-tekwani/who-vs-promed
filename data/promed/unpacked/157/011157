[During the period since the last update on 27 Jun 2019 and today (16 Jul 2019) there have been 5 newly confirmed cases including 2 deaths reported by Saudi Arabia. The cases occurred in 2 regions, Najran and Riyadh. All 5 cases were reported to be primary cases, none of whom had known contact with camels. It is safe to say that in the absence of clusters (either household-based or healthcare-associated), there is a return to an endemic pattern of disease transmission.

Of the 14 cases reported, 4 cases were associated with 2 separate clusters. Cluster 1 involved 2 cases (case no. 6 and case no. 7) living in the same household in Alkharj, Riyadh, and cluster 2 involved one patient (case no. 9) and one healthcare worker (case no. 11) in Riyadh.

MERS-CoV cases reported between 1 and 31 May 2019*

*Data subject to change due to ongoing investigations. Fields related to the final status of the case are updated as information is available.

NA = Not available
NR = Not reported

From 2012 through 31 May 2019, a total of 2442 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection and 843 associated deaths were reported globally to WHO under the International Health Regulations. The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected member states.

WHO risk assessment
Infection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedary camels. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in healthcare settings.

The notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedary camels, animal products (for example, consumption of camel's raw milk), or humans (for example, in a healthcare setting or household contacts).

WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.

WHO advice
Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all member states to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in healthcare facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV infection early because, like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.

Early identification, case management, and isolation, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures, can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.

MERS causes more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and compromised immune systems. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close unprotected contact with animals, particularly dromedary camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.

Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

[According to the WHO update, as of 31 May 2019 a total of 2442 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection and 843 associated deaths have been reported globally since 2019 [reported case fatality ratio 34.5%). There was one additional death reported during this period (see case no. 1 above). If one adds the additional cases reported since 31 May 2019, the global tally increases by 12 additional laboratory-confirmed cases including 3 additional reported deaths.

Cases during this period came from Riyadh region (10 cases), and one each from Jeddah (Makkah region), Madinah, Najran, and Al Qassim. Of note, 8 of the cases reported during this period had a history of diabetes. All 5 of the fatalities (including case no.1) had a history of diabetes consistent with the observation of more severe disease in individuals with diabetes.
