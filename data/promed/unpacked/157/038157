Foot & mouth disease [FMD] - update
-----------------------------------
A message from an unofficial source has just been received reporting
a wide-scale outbreak of FMD in the Turkish-Syrian border region. No
details on the serotype involved were available. The threat of this
outbreak spreading towards Israel should be taken into consideration.

Several months ago, there was an outbreak of FMDV serotype A in
Israel [See 20090714.2510. - Mod.AS]. FMDV serotype A has been absent
from Israel since 1981. The IVSAH are currently engaged in the final
stages of country-wide vaccination of cattle and small ruminants
against FMDV serotypes O and A.

Immediate notification of any suspected case to the District
Veterinary Officers is essential. Sudden deaths in offspring of
cattle, sheep, goats and pigs may sometimes be the only clinical
expression of FMD infections, even in vaccinated holdings.

[14 outbreaks of FMDV serotype A have been recorded in Israel during
2009; the 1st 12 outbreaks, between February and May 2009, were
initially serotyped as FMDV-O and notified as such to the OIE; in
July 2009, when 2 additional outbreaks were serotyped as FMDV-A, it
became apparent that the previous outbreaks were, in fact, also
serotype A; corrective notification was submitted to the OIE. The
outbreak was declared as resolved on 3 Aug 2009; no additional
outbreaks have been reported since.

FMD has a seasonal pattern in Israel, with the disease, if present,
starting in January and peaking in April-May. Not a single outbreak
has been recorded in November for several decades.

The FMD situation in the Middle East has been reviewed and discussed
during the 5th Roundtable for the surveillance and control of FMD in
the Middle East, held in Beirut (Lebanon), 7-9 Apr 2009 (see
<http://www.rr-middleeast.oie.int/viewpage.asp?id=492>). In addition
to countries' presentations on the FMD situation in Egypt, Jordan,
Kuwait, Lebanon, Sudan and Turkey, the report includes section B with
the following "General Presentations:"
1- Foot and Mouth Disease, Middle East Situation; summary of answers
to the questionnaire, by Dr. Pierre Primot - Regional OIE
Representation;
2- FMD strains and substrains risk to the Middle East: review and
situation updates, by Dr. Antonello Di Nardo;
3- Contributing to the FMD Global Strategy, by Drs. Sumption,
Lubroth, Potzsch and Pinto.

Dr Primot's presentation (go to B1) reviews, among other things, the
seasonality and the possible involvement of wild boars in FMD
epidemiology, as observed in Israel (slides 26 and 27).

Genotyping results of FMDV serotypes A and O in Turkey, as carried
out by the world reference lab in Pirbright during 2008 and 2009, are
available at <http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/me/tur.htm>.
Similar information regarding Syria is not available.

Information from Turkey and Syria on the accuracy (or, hopefully,
otherwise) of the unofficial report concerning a wide-scale FMD
outbreak, allegedly spreading along their common border areas, will
be much appreciated. In case verified, the identity of the virus
involved and the applicability of available vaccines for its control
are essential for the entire region. - Mod.AS].
