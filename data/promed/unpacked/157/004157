The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 10 Dec 2018:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 500, of which 452 are confirmed and 48 are probable. In total, there were 289 deaths (241 confirmed and 48 probable) and 172 people healed.
- 80 suspected cases under investigation.
- 2 new confirmed cases, including 1 in Beni and 1 in Mabalako.
- 4 new deaths of confirmed cases, including 2 in Beni, 1 in Butembo, and 1 in Mabalako. Among these deaths are 2 community deaths, 1 in Beni and 1 in Mabalako.
- 5 new recoveries, including 2 releases from the Beni ETC. and 3 from the Butembo ETC.

News of the response
Vaccination
-----------
- Continued wide-belt vaccination (or ring plus) in Otomaber (in Komanda health zone [Ituri]) and Aloya (in Mabalako health zone [North Kivu]).

- 3 contacts of a confirmed case of Beni had moved to Kisangani [Tshopo province] before being vaccinated. A vaccination team was then sent to Kisangani to vaccinate these 3 contacts, who are still asymptomatic to date and therefore non-contagious, as well as 10 additional members of their family living in Kisangani as contact contacts. It was the collaboration between the coordination of the response to Ebola in Beni and the provincial health authorities of Tshopo that helped to find the contacts in Kisangani. The 3 contacts, behaving responsibly, agreed to go back to Beni and be followed for 21 days before traveling again.

- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 44 447 people have been vaccinated, including 18 559 in Beni, [total numbers of people vaccinated in North Kivu, Ituri, and Tshopo provinces can be seen at the source URL above].

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 9 Dec 2018:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 498, of which 450 confirmed and 48 probable. In total, there were 285 deaths (237 confirmed and 48 probable) and 167 people cured.
- 73 suspected cases under investigation.
- 4 new confirmed cases, including 3 in Katwa and 1 in Vuhovi.
- 2 new deaths of confirmed cases (all community deaths), including 1 in Katwa and 1 in Vuhovi.
- 2 new recoveries, including 1 release from the Beni ETC and 1 from the Butembo ETC.

News of the response
Focusing
--------
- Some media reported that the Ebola outbreak had just reached the town of Butembo. However, the Ministry of Health recalls that the 1st case of Ebola was identified in the town of Butembo on 4 Sep 2018. This was a high-risk contact of a confirmed case deceased from the Ndindi district, in the city of Beni, who refused the vaccination and fled to Butembo to escape the monitoring teams. The Minister of Health, Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, visited Butembo on 6 Sep 2018 to oversee the response activities in this major commercial city of North Kivu. A few days later, the emergency operations center and the Ebola treatment center [ETC] were fully operational.

- In the past 6 weeks, a significant increase in Ebola cases and deaths has been observed in Butembo and Katwa, mainly due to the reluctance of the population, the destruction of health infrastructure, and the physical aggression of the response teams [see below]. At a press conference in Kinshasa on 6 Dec 2018, the Minister of Health had described the increase as disturbing. Despite the difficulties, additional teams are being sent to Butembo and neighboring health zones on a daily basis to strengthen all pillars of the response in these areas.

- Although this epidemic of Ebola, the most serious in the history of the Democratic Republic of Congo, attracts the attention of the world, it is important to remain factual, scientific, and avoid "sensationalizing" a situation already extremely complex and unique. The DRC is the only country in the world facing an epidemic of one of the deadliest diseases in such a difficult and unpredictable environment.

- The Ministry of Health is already working with the best Congolese and international experts from WHO, UNICEF, the African Union, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), Alima [Alliance for International Medical Action], the Red Cross, and many other organizations. Congolese providers stood out for their courage and dedication. During this epidemic, they realized what no one else had ever done, such as negotiating with Mai-Mai leaders to access their village and vaccinate whole communities against Ebola. They are driven by a remarkable sense of responsibility and duty towards their country and their fellow citizens. This epidemic has also given new meaning to the concept of international cooperation. Strong links have been created between Congolese and international experts by spending so much time together in a difficult environment. They work not only together but they also support and encourage each other. This collaboration between Congolese and international teams is exemplary.

- The Ministry of Health remains open to any expert and any organization with proven expertise in a specific area of the response. Despite the fact that they did not have security clearances to travel to Ebola-affected areas, US experts from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the US Agency for Development USAID have been involved in the response since August 2018. They bring their expertise from Kinshasa and Goma, and make the connection with Washington DC and Atlanta.

Vaccination
-----------
- Continued wide-belt vaccination (or ring plus) in Otomaber (in Komanda health zone [Ituri]) and Aloya (in Mabalako health zone [North Kivu]).

- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 43 944 people have been vaccinated, including 18 500 in Beni, [total numbers of people vaccinated in North Kivu and Ituri provinces can be seen at the source URL above].

The #Ebola case count in North Kivu now stands at 498 confirmed & probable cases, & 285 deaths. Today +4 cases & +2 deaths were reported. 167 people have survived & been discharged from care.

2. It looks like the DRC government isn't happy with some of the international coverage of the outbreak.

[Under News of the response, it states "In the past 6 weeks, a significant increase in Ebola cases and deaths has been observed in Butembo and Katwa, mainly due to the reluctance of the population, the destruction of health infrastructure and the physical aggression of the response teams." The phrase "physical aggression of the response teams" has been corrected by CIDRAP to read "physical aggression FACED BY the response teams."]

- Tue 11 Dec 2018. Ebola count in DRC hits 500 in growing outbreak
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease research and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/12/ebola-count-drc-hits-500-growing-outbreak
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

The world's 2nd-largest Ebola outbreak hit another milestone today [11 Dec 2018], as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) recorded 2 new cases, raising outbreak totals to 500, including 289 deaths.

Of the 4 new deaths recorded today [11 Dec 2018], 2 are community deaths in Beni and Mabalako, which took place outside a hospital or Ebola treatment center, raising the risk of transmission, the DRC said.

There are also 80 people currently under investigation for suspected infections, the DRC's health ministry said in its daily update.

Unknown transmission chains
---------------------------
According to the latest weekly update from the World Health Organization's (WHO's) African regional office, among the 500 cases are 3 healthcare workers who have been infected since 1 Dec 2018 . Since August 2018, when the outbreak began, 49 healthcare workers have been infected, and 15 of those have died.

While vaccination and case contact tracing are under way, there are still unknown transmission chains in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, the WHO said. On 8 Dec 2018, for example, the agency said 5 new cases were identified, yet only 2 of the cases were known contacts.

"Contact tracing is still of concern due to insecurity and continuing pockets of community resistance. The number of contacts being followed as of 8 Dec 2018 was 6417, of whom 5812 had been seen in the previous 24 hours, representing 92%," the WHO regional office said.

As of today [11 Dec 2018], the DRC said 44 447 people have been vaccinated with Merck's unlicensed Ebola vaccine. The WHO said the remaining stock of vaccine in Beni is 4290 doses.

Katwa hospital burned
---------------
The WHO said Beni, Katwa, and Kalunguta [North Kivu] are the hot spots of the outbreak, representing 30%, 27%, and 17% of the 119 confirmed and probable cases reported from 18 Nov-8 Dec 2018.

The WHO also said Komanda [Ituri] is an area of concern owing to surveillance challenges. The organization also said 2 healthcare posts and the Hope Health Centre in Katwa were burned by community members, another example of ongoing resistance in the volatile region.

"Particular challenges lie in investigating new confirmed cases without clear epidemiological links to other cases, the need to strengthen contact monitoring in Beni and Komanda and the need to intensify community engagement in Katwa. In addition, the potential implication of the upcoming elections bringing large numbers of people together remains an issue," the WHO said.

Difficulties with containment
-----------------------------
On Twitter today [11 Dec 2018], Peter Salama, MD, the WHO's deputy director-general for emergency preparedness and response, said new epidemiologic data illustrate the challenges of containing the outbreak.

"The epidemiological curve shows 2 phases. First centered in Mangina [North Kivu], largely controlled in a month. 2nd wave, more concerning, dispersed across many areas, has continued for over 2 months, with about 5 new cases per day," Salama tweeted.

In Beni [North Kivu], which has had more than 200 cases of Ebola, Salama said, "[the] epi curve shows weekly incidence declining, but not over." As cases in Beni fall, case counts are on the rise in Katwa and Butembo [North Kivu].

"We continually adapt our strategies to respond to each new challenge in this complex outbreak. Working with [the DRC ministry of health], partners, we will end this," Salama said.

South Sudan to immunize at-risk people
--------------------------------------
In other outbreak developments, South Sudan's health ministry, with support from several health partners, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, announced plans to vaccinate healthcare and frontline workers in high-risk states that border the DRC.

South Sudan is one of 3 DRC neighbors deemed to be at very high risk of Ebola importation. The country is on high alert, but no confirmed cases have been detected. The step is part of South Sudan's national preparedness efforts and follows a similar campaign announced last month [November 2018] to vaccinate the same groups against Ebola in Uganda.

In an 8 Dec 2018 statement, the WHO's South Sudan office said a 60-person vaccination team underwent 4 days of training in the country's capital city of Juba last week [week of 3 Dec 2018]. Members are from 4 states: Juba, Yei, Yambio, and Nimule.

According to the WHO, 2160 doses of VSV-EBOV, Merck's experimental Ebola vaccine, have been allocated for the South Sudan campaign, and vaccination is slated to begin on 19 Dec 2018 in Juba. Those who are vaccinated will be followed up for 21 days.

Week 49: 1-7 Dec 2018
Data as reported by 7 Dec 2018
--------------------------------------------------
Event description
-----------------
The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to be closely monitored. Since our last report on 30 Nov 2018 (weekly bulletin 48), 54 new confirmed EVD cases and 28 new deaths have been reported. 3 health workers were among the new confirmed cases, bringing the total number of health workers affected to 49, with 15 deaths (the increase following data reconciliation). On 8 Dec 2018, 5 new confirmed cases were reported, one each, in Beni, Butembo, Kyondo, and Mabalako in North Kivu province, and Mambasa in Ituri province. Of these, 2 cases were known contacts and investigations to establish the epidemiological links of the other 4 cases are ongoing. There were 3 new deaths, one each, in Beni (the case from Mambasa), Butembo, and Mangina.

Public health actions [see source URL above]

Situation interpretation
------------------------
The EVD outbreak in Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to be of significant concern, with continuing insecurity and community resistance, with the burning of 2 health facilities in Katwa particularly worrying. Particular challenges lie in investigating new confirmed cases without clear epidemiological links to other cases, the need to strengthen contact monitoring in Beni and Komanda and the need to intensify community engagement in Katwa. In addition, the potential implication of the upcoming elections bringing large numbers of people together remains an issue. All response pillars need to be further strengthened and local and international authorities need to remain vigilant in the face of this ongoing outbreak.

#Ebola thread: The number of infected health workers has now hit 49, with 15 of those cases fatal. The new figure (+3) reflects old cases that came to light in a recent review of all infections, according to @WHOAFRO.

2. People have questioned whether this number of HCW infections is a sign the #Ebola vaccine isn't working. I'm told that is not the case. Some were infected before vaccine was available. Some refused vaccine. Some were vaccinated when they were already ill -- that is, too late.

3. The @WHOAFRO report describes a troubling situation at Katwa, one of the current #Ebola hotspots (& unsettlingly near Butembo, pop. 1M). Community resistance is a problem at Katwa, where people recently showed their anger in a concrete but counterproductive way.

4. The southward movement of #Ebola is a real concern. @PeteSalama recently told me the security factors are more nuanced and complicated the further south it goes, with more fighting factions.

[3] Outbreak: threat of expansion
Date: Mon 10 Dec 2018 4:45 PM EST

https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/12/ebola-vaccine-having-major-impact-outbreak-may-still-explode-west-africa


As an Ebola outbreak in a conflict-plagued region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) continues to spread after 4 months, there's a glimmer of hope: An experimental Ebola vaccine appears to be helping the communities it reaches. More than 40 000 people have received the vaccine, by far the largest use of it since a trial in 2015 showed it worked well. The vaccine's effectiveness in this outbreak has not been formally assessed. But Peter Salama, who heads the Ebola response for the World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva, Switzerland, says, "I think it's having a major impact."

WHO, which works in concert with the DRC's Ministry of Public Health, can't distribute the vaccine as widely as it would like, however, because of limited supplies, Salama notes. And the obvious targets for vaccination -- people who have had contact with cases -- have been difficult to identify and reach because of the ongoing conflict; a small number of front-line health care workers have even been caught in the crossfire.

So far the outbreak has tallied some 500 cases, about half of whom have died, according to the DRC's Ministry of Public Health. It spans a region of the DRC's northeast that abuts 4 other countries, and Salama and many others worry about the deadly virus jumping a border, which would require separate response teams and boost the potential for wider spread by infecting people with increased transportation options. Without more financial and personnel support from wealthy countries, the situation could explode into a long-running calamity similar to the Ebola epidemic that devastated 3 West African countries from 2014-2016, warns an editorial published last month [November 2018] in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) [https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1814296]. A consensus statement from 25 public health and policy experts published the same week in The Journal of the American Medical Association calls the outbreak "exceptionally" dangerous https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2717586.

The editorials urge the US government to change a policy that prevents its Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from sending staff to the region because of security concerns. And many are calling for a WHO-established review committee to designate the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, which could drive more countries to contribute to the response; in October [2018], the panel said the designation wasn't yet necessary.

Although the toll so far is much smaller than the West African epidemic's 28 000 cases and 11 000 deaths, it's now the 2nd largest Ebola outbreak ever documented, and one of the longest running. The outbreak has hit mothers and their young children especially hard, because many sought care for malaria at health centers that unknowingly have Ebola cases. Women have made up 62% of all cases, and 24% were children under age 15. Only about 50% of new infections are in people previously identified as having been in contact with a case, which underscores how the violence has interfered with contact tracing.

Salama says funding for the response in the DRC has been ample so far, but will run out in January 2019. Programs to support readiness and preparedness efforts in 9 neighboring countries need another USD 45 million, he says. He's particularly worried about Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda, and South Sudan, all bordering the DRC. "If there is a case, as is very likely in surrounding countries, we want to pick up that first one so we can have a very robust response," Salama says.

He adds that the front-line responders from the DRC, WHO's 300 staffers on the ground, and personnel from nongovernmental organizations such as Doctors Without Borders and ALIMA are "frankly exhausted" from working long days in a conflict zone. "Where can we keep finding these brave people who are expert in viral hemorrhagic fever and know how to operate in a conflict-affected area?" he asks.

CDC has perhaps more people with this twin skill set than any other institution in the world, and it's working closely with WHO and others -- but not in the hot zone. Salama says the complexities of this outbreak, such as the surprising role of malaria cases, require a nimble response, which would make CDC's seasoned staff invaluable. "A senior leadership cadre has long-term experience and can help drive teams in the right direction," he says.

Epidemiologist Jennifer Nuzzo, who co-authored the NEJM editorial and also co-signed the consensus statement, hopes the pressure will lead the US government to rethink the policy of keeping CDC out of the region. "The situation is serious enough that we're pulling all the levers we can," says Nuzzo, who works at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland. Salama, however, is skeptical the editorials will change the US government's position.

Salama says if malaria cases drop, fewer people will visit health clinics, which could help slow Ebola's spread. To that end, Ebola responders are distributing insecticide-treated malaria bed nets. They're also beginning to offer the Ebola vaccine to people who come to clinics seeking malaria care. But fewer than 260 000 doses of the vaccine are left, and there are competing demands, including a push to vaccinate health care workers in the bordering countries. (Uganda has already started to use it, and South Sudan plans to begin to vaccinate on 19 Dec 2018.)

Salama estimates that even in a best-case scenario the outbreak will run another 6 months. And it could be far worse. "This is the kind of massive, massive priority that the whole world should be very much focused on and willing to contribute to solving."

[Since this outbreak has been stated to be a massive priority, it seems PHEIC [Public Health Emergency of International Concern] should be declared to facilitate termination before the virus spreads internationally. While cases are dropping in some areas, they are not in others, and community deaths and unknown transmission chains are still occurring - see CIDRAP reports above. - Mod.LK]

[4] Children
Date: Tue 11 Dec 2018
Source: UN OCHA, ReliefWeb, UNICEF (UN Children's Fund) report [abridged, edited]
https://ponabana.com/en/children-account-for-more-than-one-third-of-ebola-cases-in-eastern-democratic-republic-of-the-congo/


Children now account for more than one third of the Ebola cases in affected regions of the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), UNICEF said today [11 Dec 2018]. The UN children's agency also reported that one in 10 Ebola cases is under 5 years old, while children who contract the Ebola virus are at higher risk of dying from the disease than adults.

"We are deeply concerned by the growing number of children confirmed to have contracted Ebola," said UNICEF's Regional Director for West and Central Africa, Marie-Pierre Poirier, returning this week from Beni, one of the current epicentres of the Ebola outbreak. "The earlier children infected with Ebola receive treatment in a specialized health facility, the greater their chances of survival. Community mobilization and public awareness activities are also crucial to ensuring early detection and quick referral of suspected cases to Ebola treatment centres."
Continued efforts are needed to raise awareness of prevention methods and promote early access to treatment which dramatically improves survival rates.

The impact of the disease on children goes beyond those who have been infected. When parents or caregivers with the disease are taken to treatment centres or pass away, some children are left on their own. UNICEF and its partners have so far identified more than 400 children who have been orphaned or left unaccompanied because of the virus. The growing number of separated children is linked to the high caseload of patients in the Ebola treatment centres of Beni and Butembo, the current epicentres of the disease.
