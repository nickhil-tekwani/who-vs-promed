An urgent warning has been issued after a froth-like substance ("spittle"), which is made by an insect called spittlebug, was found on plants. Scientists are worried that the deadly plant disease xylella could be spread by spittlebugs as carriers. If xylella was found in the UK, all plants within a 100 m [about 109 yards] radius would need to be destroyed and a 5 km [3.1 mi] radius quarantine area set up for up to 5 years afterwards.

A spittlebug survey is in progress. People are being asked to report any sightings of either spittle, nymphs (juveniles), or adults of xylem-feeding insects (spittlebugs/froghoppers and some leafhoppers) that have the potential to act as vectors of the xylella bacteria so that any potential outbreaks could be tracked to a source.

The records will help to build up a picture of where the insects are found, what plants they feed on and how much they move around. This information will be essential for deciding how best to respond should xylella arrive in the UK.

[_Xylella fastidiosa_ (Xf) clogs the xylem of plants, leading to wilting, necrosis, and often death. It causes many serious crop diseases such as Pierce's disease of grapevine; leaf scorch of coffee, almond, and olive (also called 'olive quick decline syndrome'); peach phony disease; plum leaf scald; citrus variegated chlorosis; lucerne dwarf; leaf scorch of a range of other woody species. Latent infections of wild species as potential pathogen reservoirs have also been reported. Several subspecies of Xf have been proposed, but more research is needed to determine their host range and risks to crops. Initially, all strains of _Xylella_ had been classified into a single species, until a 2nd species in the genus, _X. taiwanensis_, was identified as the cause of a pear leaf scorch (see ProMED post 20181022.6105629).

Xf is spread by xylem-feeding insects (Hemiptera), but also by grafting and with infected plant material. True seed transmission, that is, via presence of the pathogen in the embryo, has so far not been shown. Recently, however, an unspecified xylella species was detected in the seed coat of pecan (_Carya_ spp.) which was later present in the resulting seedlings (see link below). However, no symptoms were evident and the possibility of avirulent Xf subspecies naturally inhabiting pecan is being considered. It was suggested that extensive vector feeding around developing fruit may have led to the contamination of the outside of the seeds.

Moist conditions favour the vectors and, therefore, Xf-associated diseases. Disease management is difficult due to the large numbers of hosts and vectors, but may include use of clean planting and grafting material, as well as vector control. Both the bacterium and its main vectors are of serious international quarantine concern and are currently considered the most serious threat to European grape and fruit production. Xf has been included on the A2 quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

Xf had previously been reported mainly from the Americas. In Europe, its report in 2013 in olives from Italy (ProMED-mail posts 20131101.2033095, 20140820.2708739, 20140424.2425497) was thought to be its 1st report in the region. However, molecular evidence later showed that multiple introductions to the region must have occurred from as early as the 1990s and were misdiagnosed as fungal outbreaks (e.g. ProMED posts 20091022.3630, 20110907.2728, 20201119.7954603); the resulting failure to implement management options early has now led to disastrous losses of valuable, slow-growing orchard trees due to Xf in the region.

So far, Xf has not been reported in the UK and strict biosecurity regulations have been implemented for any plant imports from Xf affected countries. A vector survey, as reported above, will provide valuable information as another precaution in case of a potential pathogen incursion.
