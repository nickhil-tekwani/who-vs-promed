[Following] the first detection of _Xylella fastidiosa_ [Xf] in Spain in [the island of] Mallorca [ProMED-mail post 20161125.4653479], as confirmed by qPCR tests, the analysis identified the 3 isolates [from] sweet cherry trees as belonging to the _X. fastidiosa_ subsp. _fastidiosa_ ST-1 strain.

The infected plants, not showing symptoms of leaf scorch, were moved to Mallorca from another nursery in Tarragona (mainland Spain) in 2012, and before were imported from the Netherlands.

The infected plants were destroyed and within a radius of 100 m [approx. 109 yd] around the garden center, all plant species known to be susceptible to subsp. _fastidiosa_, i.e. oleander (_Nerium oleander_) and cherry (_Prunus avium_), will be uprooted. To prevent spread, a contingency plan has been established and surveys on potential Xf-host plants in the area are being carried out.

[_Xylella fastidiosa_ (Xf) clogs the xylem of plants leading to wilting, necrosis and often death. It causes many serious crop diseases such as Pierce's disease of grapevine; leaf scorch of coffee, almond and olive; peach phony disease; plum leaf scald; citrus variegated chlorosis; lucerne dwarf; leaf scorch of a range of other woody species. Latent infections of wild species as potential pathogen reservoirs have also been reported. While all strains of _Xylella_ have been classified into a single species, several subspecies have been proposed and more research is needed to determine their host range and risks to crops.

Xf is spread by xylem-feeding insects, but also by grafting and with infected plant material. It is not seed borne. Moist conditions favour the vectors and therefore Xf-associated diseases. Disease management is difficult due to the large numbers of hosts and vectors and may include use of clean planting and grafting material, as well as vector control. Both the bacterium and its main vectors are of serious quarantine concern. The pathogen has been added to the EPPO quarantine lists.

Xf has been reported mainly from the Americas, but also on grapevine in Taiwan (ProMED-mail post 20130806.1866205). In Europe, it seems likely that the outbreak on olives in Italy (ProMED-mail posts 20131101.2033095, 20140820.2708739 & 20140424.2425497) represents the 1st report of the pathogen in that region.

Xf subsp. _fastidiosa_ is the cause of Pierce's disease of grapevine; recently, it was reported for the 1st time from oleander and from Europe (ProMED-mail post 20160802.4387487). Leaf scorch of oleander has been reported to be due to ssp. _sandyi_ and possibly also _pauca_. Ssp. _pauca_ has been reported to cause diseases on coffee, citrus and olives. Olives have also been reported to be susceptible to ssp. _fastidiosa_ and _multiplex_.

For Europe, olives in Italy are thought to be infected by a somewhat atypical form of ssp. _pauca_. In France, multiple isolates from ornamental species of ssp. _multiplex_, as well as a single detection of ssp. _pauca_ (presumably on ornamental coffee plants) are being reported (see link below). Adding the information above, ssp. _fastidiosa_ has now been identified on 2 hosts (oleander, cherry) and in 2 locations (Germany, Spain) in Europe. The presence of this ssp., especially in an asymptomatic reservoir host, is considered a serious risk to European grape production from Pierce's disease. Further work is needed on pathogen distribution, host range and potential vectors in the region.

It was thought initially that the source of the European incursion was due to contaminated imports of plant material. However, the detection of multiple ssp. in a diversity of hosts suggests a much more complex scenario which may have global implications on plant quarantine.
