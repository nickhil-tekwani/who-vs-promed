[Unfortunately, there is much missing data in this report, including
all critical information on numbers of sheep cases, deaths,
destroyed, and slaughtered. Also, the number of cattle slaughtered
appears to be zero but it is not reported as such. It is also
important that the serotype is not given. The previous outbreak in
2000 was of serotype O.
