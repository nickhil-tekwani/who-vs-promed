Research and Technology
-------------
25 Sep 2015: Researchers develop chip-based instrument for reliable detection of Ebola virus
http://www.news-medical.net/news/20150925/Researchers-develop-chip-based-instrument-for-reliable-detection-of-Ebola-virus.aspx
[A chip-based technology for reliable detection of Ebola virus and other viral pathogens has been developed by a team led by researchers at UC Santa Cruz. The system uses direct optical detection of viral molecules and can be integrated into a simple, portable instrument for use in field situations where rapid, accurate detection of EBOV is needed.]

[The report was published in _Nature Scientific Reports_: H. Cai J. W. Parks , T. A. Wall et al. 2015. Optofluidic analysis system for amplification-free, direct detection of Ebola infection. Scientific Reports 5, Article number: 14494 (2015) doi:10.1038/srep14494 http://www.nature.com/articles/srep14494. The technology is able to accurately distinguish Ebola from its less-deadly cousins, Sudan virus and Marburg virus. But more work needs to be done, as the technology currently isn't designed to handle raw blood samples. There's still pre-processing to be done, and that still needs to happen at a specialized facility. - Mod.LK]

With EUAL, the assay is now eligible for WHO procurement. The WHO had previously assessed new in vitro diagnostic technologies annually but instituted the EUAL emergency mechanism for Ebola in response to the outbreak in West and Central Africa. There are currently 6 Ebola tests accepted for procurement through the EUAL Procedure ... - more].
