4 inhabitants of Moscow have fallen ill with a rare illness --
psittacosis. 3 of the 4 cases of psittacosis have been linked to
parrots. As announced by the Territorial Management Russian Public
Health Service (Rospotrebnadzor) of Moscow, 2 persons were infected
from their own birds. In both cases, parrots had been obtained locally.
One more inhabitant of Moscow was infected with psittacosis in Mexico
during an excursion to a local reserve. In the 4th case, the source
of the infection was a pigeon.

Several years ago, a large outbreak of this infection took place
among workers at the Moscow zoo. The source of the infection was
parrots delivered from abroad.

[Psittacosis, also known as ornithosis or parrot fever, is a human
disease caused by the bacterium _Chlamydophila psittaci_. Classically
associated with psittacine birds such as parakeets, parrots, and
cockatiels, it may affect other avian species such as turkeys, ducks,
pigeons, and pheasants. Human infection in general is caused by
inhalation of dust containing the bacterium, which is shed in large
amounts in the feces and secretions of the infected birds.

The respiratory infection, usually diagnosed serologically, can be
fatal if untreated. Although most diagnosed cases have direct
exposure to birds, the infection may be acquired indirectly through
the aerosolization of infective material in the grass or ground such
as when mowing a lawn. Because of such outbreaks, protective
equipment may be recommended for individuals in areas frequently by
free-ranging birds if contact with birds and their droppings is
likely when performing outdoor activities such as lawn mowing (1).

People who are occupationally exposed to psittacosis include pet
store workers, poultry farmers, poultry processing workers, and
veterinarians. A noteworthy outbreak of psittacosis was diagnosed in
Belgian customs officers exposed to parakeets imported illegally by
an Indian sailor (2). In this outbreak, the attack rate was 47
percent (7 of 15), and the risk of infection was 2.8 times higher in
officers exposed to the birds for more than 2 hours as compared to
those with only brief exposure.
