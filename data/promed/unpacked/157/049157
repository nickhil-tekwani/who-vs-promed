Meningitis outbreak widens in Russian Far East
------------------------------------------------
KOMSOMOLSK-NA-AMURE: 126 children have been hospitalized in
Komsomolsk-na-Amure, 78 of them have been diagnosed with [aseptic?
meningitis. The local epidemiologists have yet to determine what has caused
the mass-scale spread of infection. It is believed that one of the main
causes is poor drinking water. Doctors have warned the population that
children should be prevented from bathing in ponds, lakes and flooded
quarries in which bacteria proliferate in this summer's uncommonly hot
weather. Quarantine has been imposed on countryside recreation camps.

[In view of the enteroviral activity in the Khabarovsk and Primorsk Regions
reported earlier (see above), it is probable that this outbreak in
Komsomolsk-na-Amure has been confirmed as aseptic (enteroviral) meningitis.
In view of the suspicion that the epidemic is due to a water-borne
pathogen, the restriction on bathing outdoors as a containment measure is
sensible. The reference to increased bacterial proliferation, however,
suggests some uncertainty in the diagnosis.
Aseptic meningitis in children is the most common manifestation of
enteroviral infection. Although the onset of illness is dramatic and
sudden, virtually all children recover without significant morbidity.
Children under one year may be at greater risk of neurological sequelae. In
temperate climates aseptic meningitis is commonest in summer and autumn.
The outbreaks in the Russian Far East fit the expected pattern,
particularly the association with summer holiday camps. Many different
enteroviruses can be responsible for outbreaks of aseptic meningitis and it
cannot be assumed that the same agent is responsible for separate outbreaks
even in the same locality. Likewise previous exposure to infection does not
provide immunity to reinfection. - Mod.CP
