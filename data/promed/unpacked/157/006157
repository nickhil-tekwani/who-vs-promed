Health Ministry (MINSA) alerted the population not to eat shellfish,
such as clams and mussels and others, after many intoxication cases
were registered in the western part of the country.
They stated in a press release that 19 persons were admitted to a
single hospital in Chinandega, 110 kilometers west of Managua, with
shellfish intoxication symptoms.
They added that their specialists are analyzing samples in order to
determine if "mollusc paralyzing venom" is present with the
so-called red tide in Pacific Ocean waters. Shellfish eaten by
affected persons were brought to the city from the ports of Corinto
and El Realejo, approximately 100 km west of Managua.

[I am not familiar with mollusc paralyzing venom. However the cone
snails paralyze their prey with a venom, and they are a mollusc.
However, I believe this article is actually referring to paralytic
shellfish poisoning.
Red tide is a condition caused by several species of toxic algae when
the weather and water conditions are right for bloom. Depending upon
the toxin, it is also known as paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP),
because it causes shellfish to be toxic for consumption. Generally
the effects in people are short-lived and not serious.
Human symptoms associated with exposure to red tide's neurotoxins can
mimic the start of a cold and affect different people in different
ways. Several doctors who deal with red tide complaints say that they
always see an uptick in emergency room visits and calls during red
tide, but that sometimes it can be hard to sort out which complaints
are truly related to red tide and which are separate respiratory
events.
PSP is a significant problem in several areas, especially both the
east and west coasts of the U.S. Produced by several closely related
species in the genus _Alexandrium_, PSP toxins are responsible for
persistent problems due to their accumulation in filter-feeding
shellfish, but they also move through the food chain, affecting
zooplankton, fish larvae, adult fish, and even birds and marine
mammals.
_Alexandrium_ blooms generally do not involve large-cell
accumulations that discolor the water and may instead be invisible
below the water surface. However, low-density populations can cause
severe problems due to the high potency of the toxins produced.
Furthermore, _Alexandrium_ spp. can grow in relatively pristine
waters, and it is difficult to argue that anthropogenic nutrient
inputs are stimulating the blooms. These characteristics are
important when considering mitigation and control strategies.
Often PSP is associated with red tides or algal blooms. Red tide is
caused by an organism called _Karenia brevis_, which in high
concentration can make the water look red. The organism releases a
toxin that paralyzes the respiratory system of fish and other marine
life.
Airborne toxins, water spray, and splashes in an outbreak may keep
people from beaches while leaving others with irritated eyes and
throats. Harvesting from affected areas for personal consumption is
discouraged. Red tide poisoning symptoms include nausea and dizziness
and may last for several days.
Previously the organism causing red tide was known as _Gymnodinium
breve_, but it has been reclassified in the taxonomy of
dinoflagellates. Its new name is _Karenia brevis_, or _K. brevis_ in
honor of Dr. Karen Steidinger, a prominent red tide scientist from
the Florida Marine Research Institute in St. Petersburg, FL.
