A 69 year old man died of botulism last Sunday [10 Mar 2013] at the Enfermeros Argentinos hospital [in the city of General Alvear, Mendoza Province] after reportedly eating contaminated canned food.

The man arrived at the hospital on Wed 6 Mar 2013, with acute pain; his condition deteriorated and he was admitted in the intensive care unit, where he died on Sun 10 Mar 2013. During the time of admission "different doctors treated him and carried out all possible diagnostic tests, arriving at a diagnosis of botulism for which the patient received treatment," reported one of the physicians, who requested anonymity.

Since the man lived alone and far from the urban centers, doctors were unable to determine what he ate or when the 1st symptoms appeared, but given the evolution of the illness, they estimate it must have been at least one week before. A team from the departmental health area went to the man's home in the locality of Canalejas, 90 km [56 mi] from Alvear, to try to identify the vehicle of transmission.

Botulism is an infrequent but very serious illness, caused by [botulinum toxin, produced by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_, which] is found in soil and unsafe water. The bacterium produces spores that survive in foods improperly preserved or canned, where the toxin is produced.

Foods that are most often contaminated with botulism bacteria are canned vegetables such asparagus, peas, corn, beets, eggplant, or peppers, and garlic and tomato less frequently. Marinades, pork, smoked or raw fish, and honey can also be contaminated.

The 1st symptoms are related to the nervous system, including speech disorders, weak cry in children, double vision, and paralysis of the limbs. The onset of symptoms varies between 1 hour and 10 days after ingestion.

Dr Pedro Farran said, "Home canning is very common in our area; the problem is not in the food preparation but in its improper canning. Even marinades with low content of vinegar can transmit the disease."
