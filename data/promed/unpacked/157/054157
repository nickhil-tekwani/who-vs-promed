Hundreds of dead mountain whitefish have washed ashore along the Yellowstone River in Montana, launching an investigation into the cause of death.

Although the mortality has yet to be confirmed, park officials speculate the fish died due to proliferative kidney disease (PKD) caused by a parasite found lurking in the waters.

Biologists on the case have counted around 200 bodies along the river between Big Timber and Livingston.

Incident reports began at the end of August [2020], with the largest group discovered over a 9-mile [14.5 km] stretch; a total of 149 dead fish were collected.

Proliferative kidney disease can be spotted by a swollen kidney and spleen, along with pale gills, all of which results in the fish becoming anemic.

The mountain whitefish is a slender silver creature found in the rivers and streams of Yellowstone, and favors deep pools and clean, clear water. Park officials note that this fish is also very sensitive to pollution.

Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks (FWP) noted that reports of dead fish began to surface at the end of August 2020. Biologists investigating the deaths have since observed hundreds of more across several areas of the river, which stretches 700 miles [1126 km] through Wyoming, Montana and North Dakota.

The team spotted 7 in one day over about 9 miles [14.5 km] from the Springdale Bridge Fishing Access Site to the Grey Bear Fishing Access Site, upstream from Big Timber.

The following day, 149 dead whitefish were found between the Pig Farm Fishing Access Site and the Springdale Bridge Fishing Access Site, downstream of Livingston. And then they counted 38 dead whitefish over 20 miles [32.2 km] between the Pine Creek Fishing Access Site and the Highway 89 Bridge Fishing Access Site, upstream from Livingston.

"FWP will continue to monitor conditions on the Yellowstone River," the statement reads. "At this time, no closures or restrictions are expected for the Yellowstone River or its tributaries."

A similar incident occurred in 2016 at the park that forced officials to close a 183-mile [294.5 km] stretch of the Yellowstone River.

[The parasite involved in proliferative kidney disease (PKD) is a malacosporean, a myxozoan whose life cycle comprises vegetative forms in 2 hosts: An aquatic invertebrate (generally an annelid); and an ectothermic vertebrate (usually a fish).

The phylum Myxozoa is comprised of endoparasites of fish and invertebrates. For most of the time that they have been recognized, myxozoans have been classified as protists, but it is now clear that they represent highly degenerate metazoans.

Malacosporeans are myxozoans that parasitize freshwater bryozoans (Bryozoa: Phylactolaemata) during at least part of their life cycle, but no complete life cycle is known. Two species have been described so far within this class: _Buddenbrockia plumatellae_ and _Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae_. The former can exist as vermiform and sac-like stages in bryozoan hosts. The latter, in addition to forming sac-like stages in bryozoans, is the causative agent of PKD in salmonid fish species in North America and Europe.

PKD can result in very high mortality rates in farmed populations and is also the suspected cause for several recent declines in wild salmonid populations. It is considered an emerging disease related to anthropogenic changes such as eutrophication and global warming. - Mod.PMB
