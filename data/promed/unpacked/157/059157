WEST NILE VIRUS - ITALY (03): (LOMBARDY) FURTHER CLARIFICATION

Evidence of WNV circulation in Italy has been found since 2008 in
animals [1,2], humans [3], and mosquitoes. Up until now, the spread
has been demonstrated in 3 regions of the northeast (Emilia-Romagna,
Veneto and Lombardy). A recent communication posted on ProMED
(archive number 20100520.1670) reports a newspaper article in which
78 human cases are erroneously reported in 2009, with 3 deaths. In
fact, 78 are the *suspected* human cases with neuro-invasive disease
detected from June to October 2009 through the surveillance system in
place in Emilia-Romagna; among them, 9 were confirmed cases of WNV,
with 3 deaths [4]. In total, 16 human cases were reported in Italy in
2009, all from the 3 regions already cited [5]. Up to now, no data
are available about the occurrence of human cases in 2010, but these
cases are expected, as mosquito activity will grow during the
spring-summer period.

Since last year [2009], active and passive surveillance strategies
are in place for the monitoring of WNV in humans, equines, birds and
mosquitoes [4] in Emilia-Romagna and Veneto. Surveillance has
recently started also in 68 municipalities in Lombardy, the newspaper
article translated and posted on ProMED (archive number
20100520.1670) says. Similar initiatives are not widely in place in
other Italian regions, such that the real estimation of the disease
[and virus] diffusion in Italy is difficult.

The virus "exploding" cited in the ProMED post is a misleading
translation. In Italian, especially in journalistic writing, the term
"explosion" is used in the sense of an "appearance and diffusion" of
a phenomenon and does not necessarily refer to a dramatic increase of
something.

[ProMED is grateful for Dr. Ippolito's further clarification of the
misleading original popular press report and the translation error of
it. ProMED regrets any misunderstanding of the West Nile virus
situation in Italy so far this year (2010) that the original report
may have created for our subscribers.
