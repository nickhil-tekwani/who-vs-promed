Indonesian boy dies from bird flu
---------------------------------
A 16-year-old Indonesian boy from Central Java province has died from
avian influenza, putting the total fatalities to 104 out of 128
contracted people in the hardest-hit country, the Indonesian Health
Ministry said on Saturday [16 Feb 2008]. The boy died on 10 Feb 2008
at a hospital in the province and the result of examination on his
blood samples came out on Friday [15 Feb 2008], showing that he had
contracted the H5N1 virus, said the ministry spokesperson Lily
SriwahyuniSulistyowati. "He died on Sunday [10 Feb 2008] and both of
laboratory tests of his blood samples showed positive on Friday," she
told Xinhua.

The boy had historical contact with fowl at his residence, as scores
of chickens belonging to him and his neighbors were sick and some of
them suddenly died before he first showed initial symptoms of the
disease on 3 Feb 2008, said Sulistyowati. "The boy slaughtered the
rest of sick chickens," she said. Contact with fowl is a common cause
of the bird flu fatality in Indonesia.

After the 1st symptoms of the disease were shown on 3 Feb 2008, such
as fever, respiratory problem and cough, the boy went to a
traditional midwife in a village, then 6 days later he was admitted
to Moewardi hospital in Solo town, said Sulistyowati. Experts have
blamed improper initial medical treatment as one of the main cause of
the highest fatality rates in Indonesia. The boy died one day after
admittance to the hospital in the province, said the spokesperson.

Indonesia, the world's 4th most populous country and home to millions
of backyard chickens, is considered a possible hot spot for spreading
the disease, although the country has culled millions of chickens and
pigs. Indonesia has been at the front row in fighting to combat the
spreading of highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses, which have slowly and
persistently spread in humans. Indonesia has grappled with major
problem on its effort to stop the spread of the virus spread,
including huge territory, traditional way of raising chickens in back
yards, and lack of obedience of provincial administration.

Bird Flu Kills Another Indonesian Boy
-------------------------------------
A 3-year-old Indonesian boy has died of bird flu, a health official
said Saturday [16 Feb 2008], announcing the country's 2nd death from
the illness in one day. The 2 cases, which were apparently unrelated,
brought Indonesia's bird flu death toll to 105.

The latest victim was identified only as a 3-year-old boy from the
southern part of the capital, Jakarta, radio El-Shinta reported. It
said he died Friday [15 Feb 2008] at a hospital in the city.

Senior Health Ministry official Nyoman Kandun confirmed the report
and said laboratory tests confirmed the boy had the dangerous H5N1
strain of the bird flu virus. It was not clear how he was infected,
and Kandun gave no further details.

Earlier Saturday, the Health Ministry said a 16-year-old Indonesian
boy from Central Java province died of bird flu. The boy, whose name
was not disclosed, became ill on 3 Feb 2008 with a cough and other
respiratory symptoms, according to the Health Ministry's Web site.

He died a week later in a hospital in the city of Solo about 280
miles southeast of Jakarta, said Sumardi, a ministry spokesman. Like
he many Indonesians, he goes by one name. Tests confirmed the boy had
H5N1, the ministry's Web site said.

The 16-year-old victim's neighbors had sick chickens on their
property and the boy apparently slaughtered some of them before he
became ill, the ministry said.

Indonesia has regularly recorded human deaths from bird flu since the
virus began ravaging poultry stocks across Asia in 2003.

Bird flu remains hard for people to catch, but health experts worry
the virus could mutate into a form that passes easily among humans
and trigger a pandemic. So far most human cases have been linked to
contact with infected birds.

Scientists have warned that Indonesia, which has millions of backyard
chickens and poor medical facilities, is a potential hot spot for a
global bird flu pandemic.

More than 225 people have died worldwide from the virus, according to
the World Health Organization's Web site.

A man from northern Ninh Binh province died of bird flu on 14 Feb

cases tested positive for the virus since early 2008.

The 5th patient, a 7-year-old from northern Hai Duong province is
under treatment at the Central Paediatric Hospital .

The National Institute of Infectious and Tropical Diseases is now
treating several other patients having bird flu symptoms while

Bird flu has killed a 2nd man in Viet Nam this week [10-16 Feb 2008],
infected a child and poultry in 2 provinces and a health official
warned more people would fall sick of the virus, the government and
state media said on Saturday [16 Feb 2008].

A 27-year-old man died on Thursday night [14 Feb 2008] at a Hanoi
hospital after he was taken there from the northern province of Ninh
Binh on Tuesday [12 Feb 2008] with serious pneumonia, the official
Vietnam News Agency reported. On 31 Jan 2008 he slaughtered 2 sick
chickens and fell ill 2 days later with pneumonia symptoms, the
Health Ministry has said. His death is Vietnam's 3rd this year from bird flu.

Doctors also confirmed a 7-year-old child from the northern province
of Hai Duong had the H5N1 virus and was being treated at a paediatric
hospital in Hanoi, the Vietnam News Agency said without disclosing
the gender or details of the infection.

Hai Duong is home to a 40-year-old man who died from bird flu on
Tuesday [12 Feb 2008], the 49th fatality of Vietnam's 103 confirmed
cases, the World Health Organization (WHO) said, citing tests
performed by Vietnamese health authorities.

Both provinces of Ninh Binh and Hai Duong are not on the government's
bird flu watchlist, but health officials said more human infections
could emerge as chicken is a popular dish at this time of the year.

"Now it is the start of spring, parties using chicken are numerous,"
Nguyen Huy Nga, head of the Health Ministry's Preventive Medicine
Department, said in an interview with the VNExpress e-newspaper
(<http://www.vnexpress.net>). "Many patients will be found in the
coming days," he said, criticising poor communication as people
failed to report dead poultry to the authorities.

Several people suspected of having bird flu were now being treated in
Hanoi, the Vietnam News Agency said without elaborating. The
Agriculture Ministry's Animal Health Department also reported cases
in the past week at 2 poultry farms in the northern province of Quang
Ninh on the border with China and in the southern province of Long
An. Bird flu killed 855 birds in Mong Cai town and another district
in Quang Ninh province on 12-14 Feb 2008, prompting the authorities
to slaughter 80 more birds, the department said. "In Mong Cai town
the poultry smuggling originated from China still takes place and
it's difficult to control," the department said in its daily report.
Bird flu also killed 150 one-month-old ducklings in Long An province
on 9 Feb 2008, it said, bringing to 4 the number of provinces on the
government's bird flu watchlist.

[The 5 human cases of avian influenza recorded in Viet Nam since late
December 2007 comprise a 4-year-old child in Son La province, a
32-year-old man in Tuyen Quang province, a 40-year-old man in Hai
Dong province, a 27-year-old man in Ninh Binh province, and a
7-year-old child in Hai Duong province. All are now deceased except
the most recent case (the 7-year-old). None of these provinces are
provinces where outbreaks in poultry have been reported recently.
Notwithstanding this all the infections are being attributed to
contact with poultry.
