Brazilian army fights Amazon foot & mouth cow cases
---------------------------------------------------
Brazil, the world's largest beef exporter, deployed the military to contain
an outbreak of foot and mouth disease [FMD] in part of the Amazon rain forest.
The government quarantined 11 ranches near the Amazon city of Manaus,
Brazil, 2850 kilometers (1770 miles) north west of Rio de Janeiro, after
discovering some cattle with the disease in early September 2004, the
agriculture ministry said in a statement on its website. Army troops, the
navy and air force are patrolling the area to prevent farmers from moving
cattle to parts of the country that export beef.
"We are doing everything necessary to eradicate this disease," Luiz Castro
de Andrade Neto, a secretary in the ministry, said in the statement.
The outbreak is the 2nd since June 2004, when Argentina and Russia
temporarily banned Brazilian beef imports after inspectors discovered
infected cows in the eastern Amazon. The June outbreak broke a 3 year stint
without reported cases of the disease in Brazil, the ministry said.
The outbreak occurred on the river island municipality of Careiro da
Vareza, and troops are focusing on preventing cows from leaving, the
ministry said. Inspectors are testing cows in 1000 ranches in Vareza to
search for other cases.
No meat from the area is sold for consumption outside the central Amazon,
making it difficult for the diseased cattle to spread into areas where beef
is exported, the ministry said.
Brazil's beef production has risen 25 per cent in 5 years and may reach a
record 7.7 million tons in 2004 because of improved genetics, better
management, and higher profitability, US Department of Agriculture said in
April 2004.
FMD is an acute, highly contagious degenerative viral disease of cattle
characterized by fever and the eruption of vesicles around the mouth and
hooves.
The bulk of Brazil's exports of fresh and frozen beef go to nations in the
European Union.

[The Brazilian authorities duly informed the Office International des
Epizooties (OIE) about this outbreak in an emergency report of 9 Sep 2004;
the causal agent was, reportedly, FMD virus serotype C, and the estimated
date of primary infection was 18 Aug 2004.

They added that the outbreak is located on an island in the Amazon, where
movements are performed exclusively by river, and is more than 500 km from
the "FMD free zone where vaccination is practised" recognised by the OIE. -
