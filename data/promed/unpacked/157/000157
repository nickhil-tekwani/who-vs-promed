A German newswire report, referencing the Jakarta Post, today said that at
least 125 persons have died in the worst outbreak of dengue fever in
southern Sumatra in the past 5 years.
Thus far, 2,500 persons have sought medical care for dengue fever.

[It is difficult for me to believe that this story is about uncomplicated
dengue fever. People with dengue fever usually do not die, nor do they
seek medical care in such numbers. If the 2,500 cases are of dengue
hemorrhagic fever, this portends a much worse scenario than simply seeing a
large number of people with fever. There is more to this than meets the
eye. Anyone have further information? I have seen nothing on PACNET? -
