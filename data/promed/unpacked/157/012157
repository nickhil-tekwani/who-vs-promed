BIOLOGICAL DEFENSE: TASK FORCE SCORPIO
======================================

The mission of the new U.S.Marine Corps Chemical & Biological Incident
Response Force is to respond to those types of attack against U.S.
diplomatic missions and military installations around the globe. But who
will assist civilians who may have been injured in such attacks?
It is not generally known that at the time of the Gulf War, in the face of
threats of the use of chemical and biological weapons in the area, the Swiss
Disaster Relief Unit augmented the nuclear and chemical expertise of its
members with international experts in anthrax, botulinum toxin and
hemorrhagic fevers, and placed this team, named Task Force Scorpio, at the
disposal of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
The mission of Scorpio, which was on 24-hour standby, was (and is) to
respond to an attack, or an allegation of the use of BW, by flying to the
area -- at the request of the UN S-G -- to determine the agent(s) used, and
the potential threat to the medical and humanitarian relief teams who would
be waiting to enter the contaminated area to provide aid to the civilian
population. This was to avoid disaster to the relief personnel, and help in
indicating the types of medication and decontamination supplies needed in
the area.
Although the world supply of anthrax vaccine had been pre-empted by the
Coalition forces, the Director-General of the World Health Organization
arranged to obtain enough to immunize the team (and key WHO personnel in
the Middle East), and they were essentially immunized against that and other
potential BW agents by the time the ground war began.
