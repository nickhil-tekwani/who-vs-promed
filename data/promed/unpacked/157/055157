[Not unexpectedly, with sheep, the _Brucella_ species identified was
_Brucella melitensis_, the causative agent of Malta or Mediterranean
fever. It was first identified by the husband and wife team who named
the organism after themselves in 1887, after isolating the agent from
the spleen of a British soldier. It took some 20 years until
Themistocles Zammit, the only non-British member of the Mediterranean
Fever Commission, figured out it was being spread to people through
goat milk among other products. All this historical perspective was
gleaned from Ed Young's birthday lecture for Jim Steele's 97th year
celebration last week.

There are a couple of points about this notification that might need
clarification. First, why were cattle and dogs reported if there was
no disease found in them. Secondly, were goats tested with the CFT
and RBT tests on 25 Mar 2010 and if so, were they part of the
affected population. - Mod.PC]
