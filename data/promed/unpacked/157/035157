The deadly coffee wilt disease (CWD) has attacked Kanyigo Ward in
Missenyi District [Kagera refion], wiping out about 12 000 coffee
trees, almost one-third of the total crop.
Out of these, a total of 2809 coffee trees have been uprooted and
burned while other 8602, approximately 65 per cent, were still on the
farms and it is feared the disease could spread to other areas.
This was revealed over the weekend during a Farmers' Field Day held
at Kanyigo, which attracted a total of 112 coffee farmers from
Kanyigo and Kashenye wards.
The Ward Councillor for Kanyigo, Mrs Esther Rwegasira, revealed that
at her farm alone, a total of 2700 coffee trees out of 3600 trees had
been destroyed by the CWD, implying a 75 per cent loss.
Mrs Rwegasira said she was initially harvesting an average of between
3 and 4 tonnes annually. However, she said, after the CWD outbreak,
the annual produce had been reduced to only 900 kgs.
Farmers have lamented that almost 70 to 80 per cent of their coffee
farms have been struck by the deadly CWD. They appealed to relevant
authorities to urgently address the problem and assist them by
getting alternative coffee varieties resistant to the CWD.
The Officer-in Charge of the Tanzania Coffee Research Institute
(TACRI) at Maruku, Mr Nyambisi Ng'homa, appealed to the farmers to
unite and form Farmers Contact Groups (FCG) to make it easier to
fight the disease.
He said the coffee disease could to wipe out the entire coffee crop
in the region unless concerted efforts are taken to check it. Mr
Ng'homa told reporters that CWD has recently been reported in Bukoba,
Karagwe, Missenyi districts and in several villages in Muleba
District.
He further said the most affected areas include the whole of
Kaisho/Murongo Division, in Karagwe District and Bugabo, Kiziba and
Katerelo divisions, in Bukoba District.
Mr Ng'homa urged farmers to uproot and destroy by burning coffee
trees that show signs of wilting. He, however, warned them to take
precautions as unsuspecting farmers could spread the disease. He
advised them to properly clean the tools by using boiling water.
He assured farmers that there are enough coffee varieties at Maruku,
adding that researchers have also introduced five new coffee
varieties, which are currently being multiplied to ensure widespread
distribution.

[Coffee wilt disease (CWD), also known as tracheomycosis or vascular
wilt disease, is caused by the fungus _Fusarium xylandoides_. It
occurred sporadically in Africa but in the last decade or so it has
become virulent, sweeping across Cameroon, the Congo and into Uganda.
According to the Uganda Coffee Development Authority (UCDA), CWD
mainly affects the native, lowland robusta variety and, since 1993,
it has destroyed over 12 million plants.
Uganda also grows arabica coffee, which constitutes only 10 percent
of production, grows mainly in the highlands, and is unaffected by
CWD.
CWD affects the entire plant. Disease management was confined to
burning uprooted plants, but the development of wilt-resistant coffee
cultivars will be a major step in alleviating shortages due to CWD. -
