Yemen: Polio cases increase to 83
-----------------------------------
The number of confirmed polio cases in Yemen has risen again this week [3rd
week May 2005] to 83, with another 411 suspected, according to aid agencies.
The World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) announced the increase at a press conference in the capital, Sana,
on Tuesday [17 May 2005]. On 15 May [2005], the number of confirmed cases
stood at 63.
"The number of confirmed polio cases has reached 83 across 6 provinces.
This number could increase to 200, as many more suspected cases are still
being investigated," WHO representative for Yemen, Dr. Hashim Al-Zain, told
IRIN in Sana.
The worst affected governorates are Hodeidah in the west, Sana and Taiz in
the south, Hadramawt in the east and Amran in the north.
Yemen was designated polio free by WHO in 1996, and officials say the
latest outbreak was brought in from Africa.
Polio is a highly infectious viral disease which invades the nervous system
and can cause total paralysis in a matter of hours.
UNICEF, one of the major partners in the country's polio eradication
program, has launched a huge campaign to promote awareness and inform
illiterate communities about the importance of vaccination.
"The spread of polio in Yemen needs a large national campaign and
mobilization to convince people that vaccination is best and beneficial for
children," UNICEF representative in Yemen, Ramesh Shrestha, said.
As part of the campaign, some 5 million vaccination doses will arrive in
Sana on 30 May 2005 and will be administered immediately in the 1st phase
of a 2-round immunization campaign.
In addition, Yemen's Ministry of Health (MoH) along with UNICEF and the WHO
are launching a social mobilization campaign to engage schools, mosques and
community leaders to motivate parents to bring their children for vaccination.
"More than 1.5 million Yemeni children are under 5 years of age, and
immunization of children is the only defense that parents can give them,"
UNICEF communications coordinator Naseem Ur-Rehman told IRIN.
He added that vaccine-preventable diseases kill 2 million children globally
every year.

Child polio cases double in Yemen
-------------------------------------
Health authorities in Yemen say 83 children have been diagnosed with polio,
nearly double the figure reported just over a week ago [2nd week May 2005].
A spokesman for the World Health Organization said the number of confirmed
cases could exceed 100.
The outbreak comes despite a mass immunization drive, after the United
Nations health body said Yemen was facing a major polio epidemic. 2 more
immunization programs have been scheduled for May [2005] and June [2005].
16 previously polio-free countries have reported new cases since 2003, when
a polio vaccine boycott in Nigeria was blamed for spreading the disease.
Polio mainly affects young children and can cause irreversible paralysis.
Yemen was previously considered polio-free.
Experts suspect the strain could have been carried from Nigeria to other
countries by migrant workers or pilgrims visiting Muslim holy sites in
Saudi Arabia.
Hard line Islamic clerics claimed the polio vaccination was part of a plot
by the US to make people infertile or give them HIV-AIDS.

polio in Yemen. - Mod.MPP]
[The size of this outbreak continues to grow, as more cases are confirmed
through laboratory testing, and more suspected cases are identified through
heightened surveillance activities. Yemen confirmed the 1st 4 cases of wild
poliovirus on 20 Apr 2005, (see prior ProMED-mail postings below). Onset of
paralysis of those initially confirmed cases had occurred in February and
March 2005. These original cases were identified through the acute flaccid
paralysis (AFP) surveillance system in Yemen. The Hudeida governorate
notified WHO Yemen of the cluster of AFP cases on 4 Apr 2005, and the
national government held a nationwide immunization campaign on 13-15 Apr
2005. As laboratory confirmation of wild poliovirus takes time (appropriate
specimens have to be transported to laboratories in other countries), the
Yemeni government conducted an initial campaign with polio vaccine the week
prior to the confirmation of wild poliovirus in the country.
In the most recent ProMED-mail on this outbreak (10 May 2005), there were
"expectations" of up to 200 cases, suggesting that as many AFP cases were
under investigation and pending laboratory results. In that posting, there
were reports of an additional 41 cases (additional to the 22 earlier
reported cases) confirmed at that time. From the reports above, it appears
as though the extension of the outbreak has been greater than originally
thought. There are currently 83 confirmed cases and an additional 411
suspected cases. It would be of interest to see an "epi curve" (a graph
presenting the number of cases by date of onset of paralysis) to see
whether these currently confirmed cases had dates of onset within a time
frame that would pre-date the impact of the 1st polio vaccination campaign
(date of onset before the campaign, or within 20 days of the campaign,
suggesting the case may have already been infected with the wild poliovirus
before the campaign was conducted, and, was in the incubation period).
For a review of the polio eradication effort presentation to the World
Health Assemby (WHA) ongoing at this time in Geneva, see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/WHA58_Polio_English.pdf>.
The document does not cover the ongoing outbreaks in Yemen or Indonesia
(these documents are often prepared during the months preceding the WHA to
serve as background papers and, therefore, do not have "hot topics"). The
document discusses the impact of the problem related to Africa and
extension to other countries previously identified as having interrupted
wild poliovirus transmission (and discussed in prior ProMED-mail postings
listed below). - Mod.MPP]
