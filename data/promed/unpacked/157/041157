Ebola: suspected case of Ebola in Democratic Republic of the Congo (from unconfirmed preliminary report from local sources)

Summary: A case of Ebola has been reported in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. The official confirmation is pending. The case is stated to be a 2 year old in a densely-populated neighbourhood of the city of Beni, one of the epicentres of the 2018-2020 outbreak. Three of the baby's neighbours presented symptoms consistent with Ebola in September 2021 and then died, however, none were tested for the virus.

GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - A case of Ebola has been confirmed in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, according to an internal report on Fri 8 Oct 2021 from the national biomedical laboratory, 5 months after the end of the most recent outbreak there. Congo's health minister declined to confirm the information, but said a statement would be published shortly.

It was not immediately known if the case was related to the 2018-2020 outbreak that killed more than 2200 people in eastern Congo, or the flare-up that killed 6 this year [2021]. The report from the biomedical lab, the INRB, said the positive result came from a 2 year old in a densely-populated neighbourhood of the city of Beni, one of the epicentres of the 2018--2020 outbreak, which was the 2nd deadliest on record. Three of the baby's neighbours presented symptoms consistent with Ebola last month [Sep 2021] and then died, the report said, but none were tested for the virus.

It is not unusual for sporadic cases to occur following a major outbreak, health experts say. Particles of the virus can remain present in semen for months after recovery from an infection. [Disturbing observation when the case is a 2 year old. - Mod.SH]

Congo has recorded 11 outbreaks since the disease, which causes severe vomiting and diarrhoea and is spread through contact with body fluids, was discovered near its Ebola River in 1976. The country's equatorial forests have been a breeding ground for the virus.

[3] WHO: new Ebola case in North Kivu

The Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo today announced that a new case of Ebola has been detected in the health zone of Butsili in North Kivu Province, where a previous outbreak was declared over 3 May 2021.

The Goma branch of the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) confirmed Ebola in samples taken from a young child who died after suffering from Ebola-like symptoms on 6 October.

Butsili is close to Beni, a town which was one of the epicentres of the 2018-2020 Ebola outbreak in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and about 50 km from Butembo city which experienced a new Ebola outbreak earlier this year. It is not unusual for sporadic cases to occur following a major outbreak, but it is too soon to say whether this case is related to the previous outbreaks. The city of Beni is a commercial hub with links to the neighboring countries of Uganda and Rwanda.

"WHO is supporting health authorities to investigate the new Ebola case," said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, World Health Organization (WHO) regional director for Africa. "North Kivu has been battered by Ebola outbreaks during the past few years, but this has built up local expertise and community awareness, paving the way for a fast-moving response."

The North Kivu Provincial health authorities are leading the current response with support from the Ministry of Health and WHO. During the previous outbreaks in North Kivu, WHO helped build the capacity of local laboratory technicians, contact tracers, vaccination teams and reached out to community groups to raise Ebola awareness, as well as put in place an Ebola survivor programme.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo's 10th Ebola outbreak which lasted for nearly two years was the second largest in the world and by the time it ended there were 3481 cases, 2299 deaths, and 1162 survivors. The country's 12th Ebola outbreak which occurred in and around Butembo was over after three months with 11 confirmed cases, one probable case, and 6 deaths.

[The Reuters report states the etiology of Ebola is confirmed, but the GPHIN report states "unconfirmed preliminary report".

The last outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) that was first detected 7 Feb 2021 after the laboratory confirmation of one case in Butembo, North Kivu Province was declared ended in May 2021. That outbreak was linked to the 2-year long outbreak that took place in North Kivu and Ituri provinces from 2018-2020. It is not clear whether the child in Beni reported here died, as did 3 neighbors (age?) earlier. Sequencing of the virus will indicate whether it is a new emergence event, but may be human to human transmission from a previously infected individual with persistent virus. Although we have now received official confirmation, we will watch for further information and would be grateful for reports from informed sources. - Mod.LK
