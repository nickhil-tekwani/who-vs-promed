----------------------------------------------------------------------
In response to ProMED-mail's request for information on the Zavdiel event:

After 2 cases of influenza A H5N1 (Shalva and Holit) a 3rd case (Zavdiel) was suspected on 29 Mar 2012, due to a real-time PCR test that was borderline positive for H5 and N1. The case involved a 6-week-old turkey flock that was tested due to surveillance activity since it was epidemiologically related to a turkey farm in the 3 km [2 mi] radius of the 1st case. This (3rd) event was reported to the OIE but not published: immediately after sending the report, the Israeli Veterinary Services held a consultation with the OIE in view of the complete absence of clinical symptoms; it was decided to keep publication on hold until more and definite information becomes available.

As a precautionary step, the flock was retested twice again, and culled before final results.

Clinical signs: the poults showed no signs of disease and there was no mortality in the flock.

Laboratory testing: 2 real-time PCR tests out of the 5 performed in the initial samples gave borderline positives for H5. When these positive samples were retested a week later they were negative. However the RNAs extracted from these samples were positive. These samples were also tested by rt-PCR with negative results.

Viral isolation [tests] of all the samples were negative after the original injection in embryonated eggs and one passage. The flocks from which these poults originated were tested by real-time PCR and viral isolation attempts, all negative.

Surveillance was carried out on all farms in a 10 km [6 mi] radius around the suspected farm in Zavdiel with negative results.

Newcastle disease virus [NDV] was found by real-time PCR and viral isolation in some of the samples of the suspected farm. This finding has been included in our recent follow-up report on NDV.

As a conclusion of all the results discussed above, it was decided to cancel the standing notification of influenza (which was not published) and to discontinue the running of protection and surveillance zones for influenza around Zavdiel. However we have established the same zones for Newcastle disease.

Meanwhile, we are still investigating the case.

[We are very grateful to Dr Bellaiche for the immediate, detailed, and candid clarification, addressing ProMED-mail's RFI; exemplary transparency.

Israel's Newcastle disease situation has been a matter of concern for some time. Follow-up report No 14, submitted to the OIE on 15 Apr 2012, is available at http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=11860.
