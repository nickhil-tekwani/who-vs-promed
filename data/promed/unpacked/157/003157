1st death caused by dengue fever is reported
--------------------------------------------
Authorities from Nuevo Leon Health Secretariat reported the 1st death
caused by dengue hemorrhagic fever. In an unprecedented case, authorities
from Nuevo Leon Health Secretariat reported the 1st death caused by dengue
hemorrhagic fever. There was a rumor around for a couple of weeks, which
was confirmed yesterday [23 Mar 2006], stating that a 15 year old girl from
Linares community died because of dengue fever.
The 1st fatal case of hemorrhagic dengue fever in Nuevo Leon was confirmed
by Mr Ricardo Huerta-Gallaga, sub-secretary for disease prevention and control.
According to health authorities, the disease that caused the death of the
girl was dengue fever, according to the results of the autopsy. The girl,
who lived in Los Angeles peripheral area in Linares, developed a clinical
condition with pneumonia and acute tubular necrosis, a kidney complication,
which confirms (suggests) the presence of dengue fever. This is the 1st
fatal case caused by this condition in Nuevo Leon since 1999. The autopsy
was performed in the University Hospital, where she died, but the Federal
Health Secretariat will determine what type of dengue the patient had.
Mr Huerta-Gallaga emphasized that this year [2006] is favorable for having
a higher frequency of such cases, since last winter [2005] was not as
intense as usual, and mosquitoes were not exterminated as they were in the
past. It is estimated that 26 states in this country are vulnerable. In
Nuevo Leon, it is estimated that some 3000 cases may be reported throughout
the year. With respect to additional similar cases, authorities confirmed 2
dengue fever cases, one corresponding to hemorrhagic dengue fever, which
affected the deceased patient, and another case of classic dengue fever,
affecting a 33-year-old person in La Florida area.

Two cases of dengue fever prompt alert
--------------------------------------
The 1st 2 cases of dengue fever for this year [2006] were confirmed
yesterday [24 Mar 2006] by the laboratory: a 26 year old woman in downtown
Asunci and an 11 year old boy in Itaugu. The occurrence of the disease was
no surprise for anybody. Heat and frequent rainfalls, together with the
existence of mosquito breeding sites in one out of 10 houses in
metropolitan areas, and the virus circulation in Brazil, make the ideal
conditions for an outbreak. Now the task for sanitary authorities is to
avoid an epidemic, such as the one in 1999 that put more than 150 000
persons in the hospital. The additional risk is that complications may
appear with dengue hemorrhagic fever in the case of a person who already
has the disease and gets infected with a viral serotype different from the
one that infected him/her the 1st time.
Dengue is a very particular disease, since it has the capacity for rapidly
disseminating. The disease is transmitted in places where there are
mosquito breeding sites. A single infected mosquito can fly up to 400
metres, and it is able to transmit the disease to a whole neighborhood.
There is no vaccine available to prevent dengue. The best way for
controlling it is to eliminate mosquito breeding sites. _Aedes aegypti_
lives near houses; it prefers clean water, and it lays its eggs in flower
vases, plates under plant pots, water fountains for animals, tanks, and
water channels. "It is important to remember that dengue is a community
problem. Preventing the disease means eliminating all mosquito breeding
sites," said Dr. Wima Basualdo, head of the Health Surveillance area.
Preventive measures are well known by the population, but they are usually
not put into practice. They basically consist of eliminating all clean
water reservoir(s). It is important to keep bottles upside down and pick up
all toys and cans from the yard. Every water container, such as flower pots
or water fountains for animals, must have its water contents changed every
day, and they must be cleaned with a sponge in order to destroy mosquito
eggs that may adhere to their walls. Used tires must be perforated and
buried. After each rainfall, it is important to wash out external water
ducts from households. It is also recommended to treat water from
out-of-use water fountains with chemicals (abate or temophos, car oil,
gasoil, or salt).
Fever, headache, retroocular pain, muscle pain and red spots on the skin
are characteristic signs of dengue. Since it may be confused with other
viral conditions, medical consultation must be sought, and a test must be
requested, which is free, from the Central Laboratory (Venezuela and
Florida). A blood test is usually performed 5 days after fever onset. Every
physician is obligated to notify suspected cases to the Ministry of Public
Health, phone: 203-998.

Dengue downs 9 in Zambo, one killed
-----------------------------------
The Zamboanga City Health Office (CHO) wants an anti-dengue city-wide clean
up day in all 98 barangays in the city in preparation for the resurgence of
dengue disease this year [2006].
This was proposed after a 3 year old child from Sitio Luyahan, Barangay
Pasonanca died of dengue recently while under treatment at the Zamboanga
City Medical Center, City Health Officer Dr Rodel Agbulos reported.
The CHO has also noted that dengue has started to pick up in various towns,
after several new patients were admitted to the city hospital suspected of
having the disease, in addition to the 8 others previously recorded.
The massive clean-up drive, expected next month [April 2006] will require
residents to destroy all possible breeding grounds of [_Aedes aegypti_],
the transmitter of the fatal dengue. Dengue cases reached an alarming level
here last year [2005].

NorthCot alarmed over rise in dengue cases
------------------------------------------
Health officials in the province of North Cotabato are alarmed over the
increase of cases of dengue fever in January and February.
Ely Nebrija, chief of the Dengue Control Division of the Integrated
Provincial Health Office (IPHO) said a total of 107 patients were admitted
in hospitals for dengue. Of this number, four died. Nebrija said the deaths
were documented in Kidapawan City and the towns of Mlang and Antipas.
Nebrija said Kidapawan City remains on top with a total of 35 cases
followed by M�lang and Antipas with 26 and 11 cases, respectively.
Vernon Qui�s, IPHO sanitation inspector, said these towns are
agricultural and have many swampy areas which could be breeding grounds of
the dengue-carrying mosquito. Qui�s has instructed the sanitary
inspectors in the affected areas to ensure cleanliness particularly in
swampy places.
In 2005 a total of 1,194 cases of hemorrhagic dengue fever were recorded in
district hospitals and private hospitals in the entire province. From
January to June last year, 673 cases of dengue were recorded in 5
government hospitals in the province. Based on the dengue surveillance
report of the IPHO, 16 people died from dengue last year in the province.
