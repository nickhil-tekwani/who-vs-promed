[1] Cholera - Philippines (North Cotabato), possible
Date: Tue 13 May 2014

At least 12 people have died, and more than 200 others have been stricken in a suspected outbreak of cholera in 4 villages in the municipality of Alamada. Alamada Vice Mayor Samuel Alim said that the death toll had reached 12 by 4 p.m. on Tue 13 May 2014 and that at least 214 other people had been stricken in the villages of Upper Dado, Tigcawaran, Mampurok, and Lower Dado and taken to various hospitals.

Dr. Edifer Demetillo of the Alamada district hospital said health authorities were still trying to determine whether the ailment that has stricken the 4 villages was really cholera. "We do not know the main cause as of yet," Demetillo said.

Alim said residents suspected the mystery affliction was caused by pesticide sprayed on rice fields which may have contaminated the local water supply following a heavy downpour Saturday [10 May 2014]. Demetillo said at least 117 patients were brought to the Alamada community hospital, and others were taken to hospitals in the neighboring town of Midsayap. "Many of them are weak and severely dehydrated," Demetillo said.

Wilmar Robles, chairperson of Barangay (village) Lower Dado, said about 15 people from his village complained of severe stomach pain, vomiting and diarrhea. "Saturday night and Sunday night [10 and 11 May 2014], the town ambulance had been transporting patients from far-flung villages to the community hospital," Robles said.

[2] Cholera - Nigeria (Zamfara), NOT
Date: Tue 13 May 2014

This is concerning the post dated 12 Apr 2014 on cholera in Nigeria. Medecins Sans Frontieres is quoted to have treated over 1117 cholera cases in Zamfara in at least 5 local government areas (LGAs) of the state within 2 weeks. We have not made such a report.

We are not currently responding to any cholera outbreaks in Zamfara. We do weekly surveillance, and no cases have been reported by Shagari Primary health centre or any of the LGAs mentioned in Zamfara in 2014. We did respond to a cholera outbreak in Gusau LGA in October 2013 and so presume this is an old report.
