[1] Cholera - Iraq

The spread of cholera in Iraq is slowing thanks to health measures taken to
curb an outbreak of the disease, the health ministry said on Tue 30 Oct 2007.

Cholera has killed 22 people since an outbreak in the northern province of
Kirkuk in August 2007 and there have been 4444 confirmed cases, almost
exclusively in northern regions. With 2968 cases and 5 deaths, Kirkuk
province has been the epicenter of the outbreak. In neighboring
Sulaymaniyah, 14 people have died and 1217 cases have been recorded. In
nearby Arbil province there have been 224 cases, the spokeswoman said.

Health officials in Kirkuk said on Tue 30 Oct 2007, they were still
monitoring places such as restaurants and water sources to try and prevent
cholera making a comeback. "The disease is decreasing. On 29 Oct 2007, we
received 3 cases," said Dr Sabah al-Dawoudi, head of the health department
in Kirkuk. "At the outbreak of the disease we were receiving more than 50
cases a day."

Across Iraq, television stations have been broadcasting advice from
officials on how to avoid the disease. In Baghdad, leaflets have been
handed out at army checkpoints and schools were making pupils aware of the
risks.

In Sulaymaniyah, most measures have been lifted but officials are
monitoring juice stalls to make sure they use mineral water and restaurants
are not allowed to serve salads or tap water. "We are about to root out the
epidemic completely from the Kurdistan region," Zairyan Othman, health
minister in Kurdistan, told Reuters.

"At the outbreak of the disease, there were 200-250 cases of diarrhea and
vomiting at hospitals in Sulaymaniyah. In Arbil it was less, there were 100
or fewer each day, in Kirkuk, 150-200. But the rate has decreased
gradually. In the last 24 hours there were 10 cases in the region." said
Othman.

A resurgence in cholera cases after almost a decade without any major
outbreaks is posing a major threat to public health, a recent nationwide
survey found, according to the latest report on health conditions by the
Thai Health Promotion Foundation.

In the north east, severe diarrhea caused by _Vibrio cholerae_ Ogawa is
plaguing local communities due to the consumption of raw cockles, poorly
prepared som tam, and fast food. Paiboon Assawatanabodi, of the Thai Health
Promotion Foundation's north eastern network, said there had been 200
infections and a death reported in Khon Kaen so far in 2007 and another 22
infections in Maha Sarakham.

About 630 people in 23 provinces across the country have been treated in
2007 for severe diarrhea caused by the El Tor Ogawa strain, according to
the Public Health Ministry. 2 people have died of dehydration caused by the
illness.

[As a short review, the flagellar (H) antigens of _V. cholerae_ are shared
with many water vibrios and therefore are of no use in distinguishing
strains causing epidemic cholera. The O (somatic) antigens, however, do
distinguish strains of _V. cholerae_ into 139 known serotypes. Almost all
of these strains of _V. cholerae_ are nonvirulent. Until the emergence of
the Bengal (O139) strain (which is "non-O1"), a single serotype, designated
O1, has been responsible for epidemic cholera.

There are 3 distinct O1 biotypes, named Ogawa, Inaba, and Hikojima, each of
which may display the "classical" or El Tor phenotype. The biotypes are
distinguished by their expression of surface antigens A, B, and C. Ogawa
contains antigens A and B, Inaba A, and C) and Hikojima antigens A, B, and
C). The latter serotype is relatively rare.

the Eastern region and Makwanpur is in the Central region, south of

Although most of the postings from Nepal just report on diarrhea with
fatalities, some previous posts have mentioned cholera in 2007 as well as
yearly since 2004. Just how much of the diarrhea or dysentery reported from
Nepal is cholera is unclear. - Mod.LL]

An outbreak of cholera in west Nepal has claimed the lives of at least 62
people and affected hundreds of others, local media reports said yesterday,
27 Oct 2007. Nepali language daily Nepal Samacharpatra reported that the
outbreak was confirmed by a government medical team dispatched to the
remote Kalikot district, about 400 km (249 mi) west of the Nepali capital.
"At least 13 villages in the northern part of Kalikot have been affected,"
the newspaper quoted the leader of the medical team Dhana Ram Oli as
saying. "More than 400 (people) were affected and at least 62 people have
already died from the disease."

Oli said the disease spread in the district nearly a month ago but lack of
medical facilities and awareness had worsened the situation. Oli also said
people were leaving their homes to seek shelter in nearby villages in the
belief that they could escape the spread of the disease.

The village of Dhaulagoha in northern part of the district was the worst
hit, with at least 18 deaths reported. The conditions are made worse by
heavy monsoon rains, which often lead to serious water contamination in
many areas of the Himalayan nation.

Cholera is an endemic illness in Senegal, hitting the population
particularly hard during the rainy season. From 3 Aug 2007 to 14 Oct 2007,
2144 cholera cases were registered with 11 deaths, a lethality rate of 0.51
per cent. The 1st case of the current outbreak was officially declared by
the Ministry of Health on 3 Aug 2007 in the district of Touba, Diourbel
Region. Following a request from the Senegalese Red Cross Society (SRCS),
the CHF 40 000 (USD 34 500) allocated from the Federation's DREF (Disaster
Relief Emergency Fund) will support their efforts to respond. The SRCS, as
an auxiliary to the government health authorities, is assisting the
Ministry of Health (MoH) to control the epidemic. This operation is
expected to be implemented over 3 months, and will therefore be completed
by January 2008; a final report will be made available by April 2008 (3
months after the end of the operation).
