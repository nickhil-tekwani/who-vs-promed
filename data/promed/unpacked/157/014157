The National Rice Corporation (Conarroz) of Costa Rica has detected crown sheath rot in rice crops grown in irrigation systems in the province of Guanacaste.

This region is the largest rice-growing area in the country, with crops grown both under rain-fed and irrigation systems.

[Crown sheath rot of rice (also called black sheath rot, take-all root rot, "mancha naranja") is caused by the fungus _Gaeumannomyces graminis_ (previously _G. g._ var. _graminis_). The disease is spreading in the Americas and seems to have appeared in Costa Rica around 2013 (see link below). The fungus attacks the crown, lower leaf sheaths and roots of the plant. Symptoms include reddish-brown to black lesions on the outer leaf sheaths of rice from the crown to above the water line, killing lower leaves. The disease leads to reduced tillering, poor grain fill, lodging and may kill the plants.

The fungus survives in plant residues and has been reported to be seedborne. Spores are spread by wind and mechanical means (including contaminated equipment). Excessive nitrogen fertilisation has been reported to favour disease development. Disease management may include cultural practices such as crop rotation with non-grass species, control of grasses as pathogen reservoirs and phytosanitation (such as removal of crop debris after harvest, disinfection of farm equipment).

Different strains of the fungus cause diseases in other grassy hosts, including many cereal crops. Amongst them, take-all of wheat is considered the most serious root disease of cereal crops worldwide, with yield losses of up to 50 per cent.
