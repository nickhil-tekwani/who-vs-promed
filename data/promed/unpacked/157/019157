Nepal
- National (Chitwan, Kathmandu, Rupandehi districts). 20 Oct 2016. Since 11 Oct 2016, nearly two dozen of patients have been found infected with dengue virus at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH). The majority of these patients had a history of travel to Chitwan district where dengue has been detected for two weeks, though some of them were residents of Kathmandu, and had no history of travel outside their native areas. Very recently, patients with dengue virus are being admitted to STIDH from Rupandehi district (Butwal), western region of Nepal, suggesting that dengue might have spreading to other parts of Nepal. There is an urgent need to intensify massive awareness of dengue, where mosquito density is highest.

- Khatmandu. 13 Oct 2016. Short term memory loss associated with dengue, Kathmandu, Nepal. On 13 Oct 2016, a 24 year old female was admitted to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital with a 2 week history of fever, headache, severe joint pain, loss of appetite and multiple episodes of vomiting (projectile). Interestingly, according to the patient's relative, she has had short term memory loss during acute febrile illness prior to her admission. She tested positive for dengue virus (IgM). Her platelet and white blood cells counts were found as low as 45 000/cumm and 2500/cumm respectively, while liver enzymes were slightly elevated (ALT-45 U/L and AST-91 U/L). Although there are a growing number of reported cases of dengue expanded syndrome, short term memory loss as seen in this patient is extremely rare, but warrant continued observations to better understand the relationship between dengue (that is, serotype-specific dengue) and neurological problems.

Singapore
- National. 17 Oct 2016. Health officials in Singapore reported last week the 8th dengue related death in the city in a 11 year old Singaporean boy who stayed at Woodleigh Close. The patient's residence at Woodleigh Close was an active 2-case dengue cluster, which was notified on 6 Sep 2016. No breeding was detected there. The cluster has since closed on 14 Sep 2016. As of Friday [14 Oct 2016], Singapore has reported 12 235 dengue fever cases since the beginning of the year [2016].

- National. 18 Oct 2016. Cases decrease to 95 confirmed between 9-15 Oct 2016, total cases 12 273. Weekly dengue infections drop to below 100 for the 1st time throughout the year [2016].

Indonesia
- National. 26 Oct 2016. New vaccine approved for use by Indonesian government. The vaccine, called Dengvaxia, has has been in development for 20 years by French pharmaceutical company Sanofi Pasteur. Since it was launched last year [2015], it has been approved for use in 7 countries and Indonesia is the 2nd country in Asia in which the vaccine passed regulatory inspection. It has also been approved for use in Brazil, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Mexico, the Philippines and Paraguay. According to a press release from Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccine has been tested through a clinical study program involving 40 000 children, adolescents and adults in 25 studies in 15 countries around the world. Efficacy analysis documented that the vaccine protects against 65.6 per cent of symptomatic dengue disease caused by any of the 4 serotypes of the dengue virus in the study population from 9-16 years old. In addition, the vaccines' protection against severe dengue reached 93.2 per cent and prevention of hospitalizations due to dengue reached 80.8 per cent.

The important take-away from that is that the vaccine has been proven to be most successful when applied to children 9-16 years old. It should also still be administered to those who have had dengue before, as there are actually 4 different strains of dengue and the vaccine protects against all of them.

A total of 3 doses of the vaccine need to be given in 6-month intervals and each dose currently costs Rp 900,000 [approx 68 USD]. Cissy said that the shots were not currently covered by the national healthcare program but that the plan was for them to eventually be incorporated into the government's national immunization program.

- Solomon Islands. 14 Oct 2016. More than 200 suspected cases of dengue-like illnesses have been reported so far from the surveillance sentinel sites in Honiara and Guadalcanal Province.

- Solomon Islands .17 Oct 2016. Health authorities declare dengue outbreak in Honiara and Guadalcanal. The declaration was made after sharp increases in confirmed dengue cases in Honiara and Guadalcanal province. The last time the ministry declared a dengue outbreak was in 2015, which was successfully contained after an aggressive campaign was carried out.

- Solomon Islands. 2 Nov 2016. Dengue outbreak Emergency Plan of Action (EPoA) DREF Operation MDRSB005. Since August 2016, an unusual increase in dengue-like illness, including the number of NS1 positive cases, has been observed through the National Syndromic Surveillance System of the Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MoHMS). An outbreak of dengue was declared by the Government of Solomon Islands for Honiara, the capital of Solomon Islands, and other parts of Guadalcanal province on 8 Oct 2016 and expanded to other provinces on 19 Oct [2016]. Surveillance for dengue has been enhanced in Honiara City Council and expanded to other private practitioners and Guadalcanal province. Between 15 Aug and 16 Oct 2016, a total of 1212 suspected dengue cases have been reported in Guadalcanal (including Honiara), Malaita and Isabel provinces (798 additional cases reported in situation report num.3 of MoHMS for the week of 10-16 Oct 2016) and at least 3 dengue-like illness cases reported for Gizo City in Western Province. The upward trend shown in figure 1 [of the report] is also partly due to the enhanced surveillance sites in the country. Up to 983 cases (81.1 per cent) cases were reported in Honiara and 161 cases (13.3 per cent) in Guadalcanal province, 67 cases (5.5 per cent) in Malaita province and 1 case (0.1 per cent) in Isabel province. Cases are widespread in all areas of Honiara including the positive NS1 cases where the population daily movement is dynamic across all areas of observation. East Honiara (37.2 per cent) and Central Honiara (18.8 per cent) were identified as the main areas where active transmission of dengue cases is occurring. A proportion (31.1 per cent) of the cases in Honiara have incomplete address information thus it was difficult to identify which areas they were from. In Guadalcanal, 82 per cent of the dengue cases that were reported within the central part of Guadalcanal (zone 6). There is no significant difference between the number of male and female dengue-like illness cases. The highest number of cases are those below 15 years old and those between 25 and 49 years old. Historical evidence has shown that both dengue virus 1 and 2 had circulated in Solomon Islands in the past and reintroduction of both serotypes will likely spread in populated areas like Honiara and urban centres in other provinces (specifically Guadalcanal, Malaita and Western).

- Solomon Islands. 4 Nov 2016. More than 1700 cases of dengue fever have been recorded in Solomon Islands, a month since the outbreak was declared. The ministry's under-secretary Chris Becha said over 1400 dengue cases were recorded in Honiara, 200 plus in the rest of Guadalcanal, 69 cases in Malaita Province, 8 cases in Choiseul and 1 case in Isabel. One infant has died, but so far 51 people admitted to the National Referral Hospital with the virus have been cured.

[Many countries in Asia continue to report a sizeable number of dengue cases. With the onset of winter delayed by several weeks, the vector mosquito seems to have found favorable climate (not too hot, neither too cold) to breed and cause disease transmission - one of the many impacts of climatic changes that are being observed globally. - Mod.UBA
