Emergency report
Information received on 19 and 20 Oct 2004 from Dr Yukol Limlamthong,
Director General, Department of Livestock Development (DLD), Ministry of
Agriculture and Cooperatives, Bangkok:
Date of the report: 20 Oct 2004.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical and laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 11 Oct 2004.
Estimated date of primary infection: 8 Oct 2004.
Date of confirmation of diagnosis: 18 Oct 2004.
Outbreak:
Location
Chon Buri province, Si Racha district
No. of outbreaks: 1 (a zoo)
Description of affected population: tigers (_Panthera tigris_) in captivity.
The sick and dead tigers are aged between 8 months and 2 years.
Total number of animals in the outbreak:
species / fau / avi*
susceptible / 441 / 12
cases / 55 / 0
deaths / 30 / 0
destroyed / .. / ..
slaughtered / ... / ...
* 10 peacocks and 2 ostriches kept in a separate area of the zoo
Diagnosis: the clinical manifestations began on 11 Oct 2004 with weakness,
lethargy, respiratory distress and high fever (about 41-42 degrees
Celsius). There was no response to any antibiotic treatment. Death occurred
within 3 days following the onset of clinical signs with severe pulmonary
lesions.
A. Laboratories where diagnosis was made: National Institute of Animal
Health and Laboratories of the Veterinary Faculties of Kasetsart and
Chulalongkorn Universities.
B. Diagnostic tests used:
- real-time PCR(1) (18 Oct 2004): positive;
- virus isolation by egg inoculation (19 Oct 2004): positive.
C. Causal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus type A (H5).
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: chicken carcass feeding appears
to be the probable cause of infection. The tigers in this zoo have been fed
with chicken carcasses for many years. A single feed supplier is
responsible for provision of tiger feed for the affected zoo. Preliminary
investigations revealed that the feeding stuffs consisted not only of fresh
chicken carcasses from a local slaughterhouse but also whole chickens from
other sources in the area. The whole chickens are the potential cause of
the infection. The DLD investigation team is endeavouring to trace the
source of these chickens.
B. Mode of spread: at present, the preliminarily conclusion is that the
disease is attributable to a common source of infection by chicken feeding
rather than animal-to-animal transmission.
C. Other epidemiological details: there are 10 peacocks and 2 ostriches in
a separate area of the zoo. These birds' health is still normal. They will
be used as sentinel animals for both clinical and serological monitoring.
Control measures:
- the zoo has been in quarantine since 19 Oct 2004;
- veterinary officials have conducted 5-km radius movement management and
surveillance;
- well-cooked chicken carcasses or pork and beef are recommended for
feeding the tigers for the time being;
Vaccination remains prohibited.

[The crude attack rate for avian influenza in these zoo tigers is 12.5
percent, but this may be a minimum estimate, as the report does not
indicate whether all tigers in the zoo were fed contaminated feed. Indeed,
it may be impossible to know except in the unlikely situation in which the
feed source is still available and excellent records were kept.
The case fatality rate of 55 percent indicates either some combination of
high doses of virus, highly susceptible tigers and/or a particularly
virulent H5N1 strain. This is a valuable opportunity to learn how this
virus acts in a new species, so no stone should be left unturned. What we
learn may be very useful should we have to contend with the jump from
chickens to humans, especially if there is a foodborne vehicle involved. I
hope epidemiologists will put great effort into working up this outbreak.-
