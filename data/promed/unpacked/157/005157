126 come down with dysentery in Russian republic of Udmurtia.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
[Dysentery is caused by toxins secreted by bacteria of the genus
_Shigella_, often _S. sonnei_ or _S. flexneri_ in Russia. Dysentery
differs from diarrhoea caused by other bacteria by the presence of pus
cells in the feces - Mod.JW]

IZHEVSK, August 11 - A local emergency commission in Russia's republic of
Udmurtia has outlined the measures to contain an outbreak of dysentery
with which 126 people came down, local reports said on Tuesday.
The outbreak was registered in the Kiyasovsky district of the republic
located in eastern European Russia. Half of the patients are children.
To control the spreading disease, Udmurtia needs 800,000 rubles. The
government commission ordered to eliminate the infection before August 20
and punished the officials who had failed to take prompt actions.
The first cases were reported in mid-June but authorities did not pay
serious attention. An overdue alarm was beaten a month later when the
outbreak had grown visibly, encompassing three villages.
Townsfolk from all parts of Udmurtia traditionally come to stay in villages
for the summer, and they could be carriers, medics said.
It was only in August that the prime source of infection was traced to
drinking water. In one affected village, all the ten hydrants did not work
and one of the artesian wells was badly neglected.
Other wells had not been cleaned for a long time and tonnes of litter were
found in a water reservoir. The village pond where children swim, was
turned into a cesspool with waste from a cattle farm.
