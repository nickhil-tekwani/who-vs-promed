The Super 8 Motel at 112 College St. SE in Lacey [Washington State] announced Thursday [1 Jul 2015] it will voluntarily close due to an outbreak investigation of Legionnaires' disease, the Thurston County Health Department said.

The county said [the] motel is working with Dr. Rachel Wood, a Thurston County health officer, and will remain temporarily closed until further notice.

Within the past month, 3 cases of Legionnaires' disease have been confirmed with possible connection to the motel.

The Health Department said Legionnaires' disease is a serious form of pneumonia that is caused by _Legionella_ bacteria. People get Legionnaires' disease when they breathe in water mist or vapor that has been contaminated with the bacteria.

The Health Department is asking guests, staff and contractors of the motel to monitor their health for symptoms of the disease and to contact their health care provider if they become ill. The time period between the time of exposure to the bacteria and illness is from 2 to 10 days, typically 5 to 6 days. Symptoms of Legionnaires' disease include: Fever, tiredness, body aches and headache; cough; chest pain; and occasionally diarrhea.

People at increased risk for Legionnaires' disease include those over 50 years of age and those with certain medical conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, and those with lowered immune systems.

The department said people who stayed at the motel are not at risk of spreading Legionnaires' disease to other people. The bacteria are not spread from person to person. Hotel whirlpools, showers, and air conditioning units have previously been shown to be sources of Legionnaires' disease outbreaks. The Super 8 motel has contracted with a laboratory to complete an environmental assessment of the motel to determine the possible source of the bacteria, the county said. The laboratory is certified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The Thurston County Health Department is working to contact guests, staff and contractors who have recently been at the motel to inform them of the outbreak. These individuals can reach Department staff by calling the Nurse Line at 360-867-2672. Though the Department is closed for general business over the holiday weekend, disease investigation staff will be available July 3-5 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

For discussions of Legionnaires' disease, please see the moderator's comments in prior ProMED-mail posts.

Genotyping of patient and environmental _Legionella_ isolates may aid in establishing transmission pathways. The predominance of a single genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from patient specimens would suggest transmission from a common source. Because _Legionella_ may be found in environmental samples without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative infectious reservoir can be confirmed by matching the genotype of clinical and environmental isolates (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/). However, this is often difficult in legionellosis outbreaks, because the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease is frequently made only on the basis of urinary _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen testing or serology rather than isolation of the organism from cultures of respiratory tract specimens. Consequently, clinical isolates are often not available for genotyping. - Mod.ML
