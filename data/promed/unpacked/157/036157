Re: ProMED-mail Rabies - India (04): (AP) canine, human 20110517.1500, the following is a response to the moderator's comment
that "In the longer term, control of rabies in the canine population
may be the best solution."

To date, unfortunately, high-volume prophylactic canines rabies
vaccination has never really been attempted (or at least never
sustained), except as a component of the national Animal Birth Control
(ABC) program which has been promoted by the Animal Welfare Board of
India since December 1997, and was implemented as official national
policy in 2003.

The ABC programs have markedly increased the pace of dog vaccination
in India, but have 2 inherent weaknesses as a vehicle for achieving
high-volume vaccination:
1. Capturing and holding street dogs for long enough to perform
sterilization surgery takes a great deal more effort than just
catching dogs for long enough to perform vaccination. A really good
surgical team might sterilize 40-50 dogs in a day; a really good
vaccination team can do 10 times that many.
2. The ABC programs have yet to be successfully extended to all parts
of India. Many excellent ABC programs are now up and running, but it
would be optimistic to presume that more than about 25 percent of
India is currently served by any ABC program at all.

Two further problems are logistic:
One of them is that quality 3-year vaccines (which in effect protect
street dogs for their usual life expectancy) are not always easily
available in all parts India. Many dogs, if vaccinated at all, are
vaccinated with vaccines of low potency.

The other logistic problem is that keeping vaccines adequately cold
in a hot climate is problematic, especially given the weaknesses of
the Indian electricity grid. Urban areas often suffer rolling
blackouts; rural areas sometimes barely have any grid at all.

These are surmountable obstacles. Oscar Larghi MD, confronted and
overcame them in Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina many years ago. But
they do have to be taken into account.

A 3rd problem, which I mentioned previously on ProMED quite a few
years ago, is vaccination resistance among the Indian public. This has
several components, and is visible in all strata of Indian society,
including among the members of the Federation of Indian Animal
Protection Organizations.

Among less educated people, there is often the same basic fear and
misunderstanding of vaccination that probably most ProMED members
working in the developing world have encountered. Sometimes this fear
and misunderstanding have been made worse by the activities of quacks,
selling ineffective home-brewed vaccines for livestock and human
diseases.

Among well-educated people, is resistance from several influential
religious communities.

Some Jains, for example, reject vaccination because cultivating a
vaccine even in an egg yolk offends their interpretation of ahimsa,
the concept of doing no harm. This can become a very sensitive matter.
Jains may be disproportionately represented in medicine, veterinary
work, and animal advocacy, and are most certainly not all in agreement
with each other about vaccination. Debate among the factions can be
intense, as I can testify from experience on several occasions as the
facilitator and moderator.

There are many other Indian religious communities with objections or
reservations about vaccination. I have encountered this among some
Hindus, some Muslims, and some Theosophists. As among my Jain friends,
there is no unanimity, but there is considerable depth of religious
conviction involved, on both sides of the issue.

At present, most Indian animal advocacy organizations endorse canine
rabies vaccinations, but up to 10 percent have reservations, and
perhaps 5 percent are still opposed.

Also of note, by the way, about 60 percent of the Indian dog
population are pets, more or less under the control of particular
people. About 35 percent are "community pets," not under anyone's
control, but relatively well socialized to people. About 5 percent are
completely feral.

The current national dogs-to-humans ratio is about 1/28, a
substantial change from as high as 1/10 circa 1997, through the
combination of the accomplishments of the ABC programs and the rapid
increase of motorized transportation. The old 1/10 ratio may still be
observed in dog-friendly villages, while in the interiors of some very
large cities with effective ABC programs the ratio is up to 1/140.

Rabies has been eradicated from the cities with ratios in the
vicinity of 1/140 -- interior Visakhapatnam, Chennai, Jaipur, and
Bangalore, for example. But rabies does still occur at the rapidly
expanding outer margins of these cities. In 2007, after the Bangalore
ABC programs were suspended for several months, canine rabies returned
to the inner city, but I understand it was again eradicated. Earlier
this year [2011] a scandal erupted in Chennai when the ABC programs
learned that rabies cases were occurring in outlying districts, of
which they were not advised, and were therefore left unable to respond
with the necessary saturation dog vaccination.

[ProMED-mail welcomes this perceptive and instructive comment from
Merritt Clifton regarding the rabies situation In India.

His comment concerning the logistic problems hampering canine
vaccination programs in India, specifically the maintenance of vaccine
quality in a hot climate, may have similar relevance in the
post-exposure treatment of human victims of dog bites. It is
disturbing that the 60-year-old woman, who is the principal subject of
the original press report, died 2 months after receiving treatment. -
