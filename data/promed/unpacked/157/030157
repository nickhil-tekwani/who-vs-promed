Preceding statin use associated with lower in-hospital COVID mortality
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Patients who used statins prior to COVID-19 hospitalization were almost 50% less likely to experience 30-day in-hospital mortality compared with those that didn't, according to a retrospective study published late last week in Nature Communications [see [B] below].

Statins are drugs meant to reduce blood fat for conditions such as high cholesterol, and, as such, they have anti-inflammatory and anti-clotting properties.

The researchers matched 648 patients who used statins and were hospitalized with COVID-19 and 648 who did not but were also hospitalized for COVID-19 during the 1st 18 weeks of the pandemic in Manhattan at New York-Presbyterian Hospital sites. Almost 15% (14.8%) of statin users died in-hospital within 30 days of admission, compared with 26.5% of those who did not, resulting in a 0.47 odds ratio (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.36 to 0.62). Overall, 17.2% of statin users died while hospitalized, compared with 31.0%.

The need for invasive mechanical ventilations, days on a ventilator, or length of hospital stay were not statistically significantly different between the groups. Those who took statins, however, had on average lower levels of C-reactive protein upon admission (100.0 milligrams per liter vs 120.7), which can indicate less inflammation.

Out of all 2626 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the hospital system, 36.2% used statins prior to admission. Statin users were more likely to be older (median age 70 vs 62), have Medicare or Medicaid versus a commercial insurer (63.0% vs 53.6%), and have comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease (ranging from 5.4-30.7 percentage points in difference).

"If their beneficial effect bears out in randomized clinical trials, statins could potentially prove to be a low-cost and effective therapeutic strategy for COVID-19," said co-lead author Mahesh Madhavan, MD, in a Columbia University Irving Medical Center press release.

Statin use associated with increased survival in severe COVID-19
----------------------------------------------------------------
People who took statins to lower cholesterol were approximately 50% less likely to die if hospitalized for COVID-19, a study by physicians at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and NewYork-Presbyterian has found. "Our study is one of the larger studies confirming this hypothesis and the data lay the groundwork for future randomized clinical trials that are needed to confirm the benefit of statins in COVID-19," says Aakriti Gupta, MD, a cardiologist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center and one of the co-lead authors of the study. "If their beneficial effect bears out in randomized clinical trials, statins could potentially prove to be a low-cost and effective therapeutic strategy for COVID-19," adds co-lead author Mahesh V Madhavan, MD, also a cardiologist at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center.

Why Look at statins?
--------------------
Gupta, Madhavan, and the study's leadership group are cardiologists who cared for hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the spring and summer of 2020 when the 1st wave of the pandemic swept through New York City. "We observed that patients who got very sick and required hospitalization had high rates of hyperinflammation and clotting," says Elaine Wan, MD, the Esther Aboodi Assistant Professor of Medicine in Cardiology and Cardiac Electrophysiology and a cardiac electrophysiologist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center, one of the study's senior authors. "As cardiologists, statins naturally came to mind," Gupta says. "In addition to their well-known cholesterol-lowering effect, statins are known for their anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant, and immunomodulatory properties."

Study analyzed data from electronic health records
--------------------------------------------------
Based on their observations, the authors looked at outcomes for 2626 patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to a quaternary academic medical center in Manhattan during the 1st 18 weeks of the pandemic. The researchers compared 648 patients who regularly used statins before developing COVID-19 to 648 patients who did not use statins. Patients in each group were matched so that there were no significant differences in demographics, comorbidities, or use of other medications at home.

50% fewer deaths among statin users
-----------------------------------
Among the statin users, 96 (14.8%) died in the hospital within 30 days of admission compared with 172 (26.5%) of patients who did not use statins. When other differences among the patients were factored in, the researchers found that statin use was significantly associated with a 50% reduction in in-hospital mortality (within 30 days). Patients on statins also tended to have lower levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation. Statin use was not associated with a statistically significant decrease in the use of invasive mechanical ventilation (18.6% in statin users vs. 21.9%), days on a ventilator (13.5 vs 12.8), or length of hospital stay (7 vs 7).

Comparison with other studies
------------------------------
Other studies and meta-analyses from China have also suggested a survival benefit from statins among COVID-19 patients. However, these results may not apply to patients in Western countries who generally have more cardiovascular disease. The current study is one of the larger studies confirming the association. Smaller retrospective studies out of North America and Europe have found similar results.

Randomized clinical trials needed
---------------------------------
Although the study compared closely matched participants and adjusted for other variables, as a retrospective analysis, unknown factors could explain the results. "Only randomized controlled clinical trials can evaluate the benefits of statins in COVID-19 patients," says senior author Sahil A Parikh, MD, associate professor of medicine and a cardiologist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Several randomized trials are underway, including studies to determine if statins can prevent hospitalization in outpatients, and lower the risk of death when given to hospitalized patients.

Abstract
--------
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can result in a hyperinflammatory state, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), myocardial injury, and thrombotic complications, among other sequelae. Statins, which are known to have anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic properties, have been studied in the setting of other viral infections, but their benefit has not been assessed in COVID-19. This is a retrospective analysis of patients admitted with COVID-19 from [1 Feb through 12 May 2020] with study period ending on [11 Jun 2020]. Antecedent statin use was assessed using medication information available in the electronic medical record. We constructed a multivariable logistic regression model to predict the propensity of receiving statins, adjusting for baseline sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, and outpatient medications. The primary endpoint includes in-hospital mortality within 30 days. A total of 2626 patients were admitted during the study period, of whom 951 (36.2%) were antecedent statin users. Among 1296 patients (648 statin users, 648 non-statin users) identified with 1:1 propensity-score matching, statin use is significantly associated with lower odds of the primary endpoint in the propensity-matched cohort (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.36-0.62, pâ€‰less than 0.001). We conclude that antecedent statin use in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is associated with lower inpatient mortality.

Discussion [abridged, edited]
-----------------------------
The principal findings of this analysis of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 are (1) antecedent statin use was common in our cohort, as 36% of patients admitted to our institution were prescribed statins prior to their index admission; (2) patients receiving statins were older, with a higher burden of cardiovascular comorbidities, (3) patients receiving statins tended to present with lower levels of CRP [C-reactive protein is a protein found in blood plasma, whose circulating concentrations rise in response to inflammation. It is an acute-phase protein of hepatic origin (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein) - Mod.LK] and (4) antecedent statin use was associated with significantly lower odds of patients experiencing the primary endpoint of in-hospital mortality in a propensity-matched analysis.

The current analysis suggests that statins merit further evaluation in COVID-19 given their pleiotropic properties and potentially disease-modifying effects in the setting of this viral illness.

[2] Long haul flight transmission
Date: Sun 28 Feb 2021

New research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) journal Emerging Infectious Diseases [see reference below] analyzed a case showing in-flight transmission of acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) despite passengers getting tested before departing to New Zealand.

Since the 1st coronavirus wave, New Zealand has had an exceptional response to the pandemic with a system of managed isolation and quarantine for people entering the country. The restrictions also expanded to include testing people for COVID-19 on the 3rd and 12th day of quarantine.

The world currently has over 114 million global cases and over 2.53 million deaths. New Zealand has some of the lowest cases around the globe reporting approximately 2378 cases and 26 deaths.

The study "Genomic evidence of in-flight transmission of SARS-CoV-2 despite predeparture testing" may help scientists and public health officials further understand the exact risk of coronavirus transmission on long flights. The international research team, led by Tara Swadi from the New Zealand Ministry of Health, writes: "Combined, these data present a likely scenario of more than 4 SARS-CoV-2 transmission events during a long-haul flight from Dubai to Auckland. These transmission events occurred despite the reported in-flight use of masks and gloves. Further transmission between travel companions then occurred after the flight, in a MIQ [managed isolation and quarantine] facility."

Details on COVID flight transmission between 7 passengers
---------------------------------------------------------
The team gathered case data from a coronavirus outbreak on a plane on [29 Sep 2020], arriving from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to Auckland, New Zealand. During the 14-day managed isolation and quarantine, 7 people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The researchers collected data from the Ministry of Health collection for epidemic surveillance. All 7 passengers infected with SARS-CoV-2 came from 5 different countries, and 5 were tested negative on one layover stop in Malaysia. All 7 passengers were seated 4 rows away from each other during an 18-hour flight. During the flight and before leaving the Dubai airport, mask-wearing was optional. 5 of the 7 infected passengers wore masks and gloves while on the plane, while 2 did not.

Genomic SARS-CoV-2 data
-----------------------
The researchers performed whole-genome sequencing on the test samples of the 7 patients positive for SARS-CoV-2. They found the sequences were genetically identical, and with the exception of one mutation from one passenger, all SARS-CoV-2 samples came from the B.1 lineage. The researchers then compared the 7 genomes to the international database (GISAID) also found 6 identical genomes, with 4 coming from Switzerland and 2 from the United Kingdom.

Tracking down the source
------------------------
Based on the results, the team predicts 2 passengers were the source of infection. These passengers had traveled together from Switzerland and had tested negative 3 days before leaving the country. One of these passengers was the 1st to report symptoms of COVID-19 infection on [1 Oct 2020] with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result the following day. In addition, they predict 4 passengers became infected during the flight, and 1 passenger became infected while in mandatory quarantine.

Limitations in genomic surveillance pose difficulty in finding the source of transmission
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
However, the researchers suggest limited global sequencing data makes it hard to narrow down the source of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak on the plane. "These findings were consistent with virus introduction onto the airplane from Switzerland by passenger A, B, or both. Nevertheless, accurately identifying the source of this outbreak may be impeded by substantial biases and gaps in global sequencing data; hence, we cannot explicitly exclude passenger C as the source."

There's also the possibility of an alternative exposure event, such as SARS-CoV-2 transmission at the Dubai airport before boarding. Although, they suggest the close seating makes in-flight transmission a likely option. "Although not definitive, these findings underscore the value of considering all international passengers arriving in New Zealand as being potentially infected with SARS-CoV-2, even if pre-departure testing was undertaken, social distancing and spacing were followed, and personal protective equipment was used in-flight."

"Abstract
--------
"Since the 1st wave of coronavirus disease in March 2020, citizens and permanent residents returning to New Zealand have been required to undergo managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ) for 14 days and mandatory testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of [20 Oct 2020], of 62 698 arrivals, testing of persons in MIQ had identified 215 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among 86 passengers on a flight from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, that arrived in New Zealand on [29 Sep 2020], test results were positive for 7 persons in MIQ. These passengers originated from 5 different countries before a layover in Dubai; 5 had negative predeparture SARS-CoV-2 test results. To assess possible points of infection, we analyzed information about their journeys, disease progression, and virus genomic data. All 7 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were genetically identical, except for a single mutation in one sample. Despite predeparture testing, multiple instances of in-flight SARS-CoV-2 transmission are likely.

"Discussion [abridged, edited]
------------------------------
"Evidence of in-flight transmission on a flight from the United Arab Emirates to New Zealand is strongly supported by the epidemiologic data, in-flight seating plan, symptom onset dates, and genomic data for this group of travelers who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

"Among the 7 passengers, 2 were probably index case-patients infected before the flight, 4 were probably infected during the flight, and the remaining passenger was probably infected while in MIQ. All 7 passengers were seated in aisle seats within 2 rows of where the presumed index case-patient(s) were seated.

"Combined, these data present a likely scenario of 4 or more SARS-CoV-2 transmission events during a long-haul flight from Dubai to Auckland. These transmission events occurred despite reported in-flight use of masks and gloves. Further transmission between travel companions then occurred after the flight, in an MIQ facility.

"Similar reports of SARS-CoV-2 being transmitted during flight have recently been published (3,4,16,17). Those reports, along with the findings we report, demonstrate the potential for SARS-CoV-2 to spread on long-haul flights. It must also be noted that the auxiliary power unit of the flight EK448 aircraft was reported as having been inoperative for [approximately] 30 minutes during the 2-hour refueling stop in Kuala Lumpur, such that the environmental control system would not have been working during this period.

"That 3 passengers had positive test results on day 3 of their 14-day quarantine period indicates some of the complexities of determining the value of predeparture testing, including the modality and timing of any such testing. Although not definitive, these findings underscore the value of considering all international passengers arriving in New Zealand as being potentially infected with SARS-CoV-2, even if predeparture testing was undertaken, social distancing and spacing were followed, and personal protective equipment was used in-flight."

These results are a little unsettling for travelers, especially those who are wary of flying again. We know that the PCR test is only really good for a brief time. Confirmed evidence of immunization (such as with a WHO Yellow Card -- see Petersen E, Lucey D, Blumberg L, et al. COVID-19 vaccines under the International Health Regulations -- We must use the WHO International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis.

Since individuals were apparently infected within 4 rows of seating, it is impossible to separate passengers sufficiently to assure safety. Quarantine would protect the destination location, but not necessarily the passengers, depending on how they are housed and the interactions permitted while in quarantine. This is a dilemma for the airlines and travelers. - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (58 910), and Brazil (38 349) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 6433 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 28 Feb 2021 to late 1 Mar 2021). Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (6 countries) include the USA, Brazil, Spain (15 978), Italy (13 106), Russia (11 571), and India (11 378). A total of 40 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 20 of the 40 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 7 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 1 from the African region. Countries not reporting cases in the past 24 hours include Mexico, Belgium, Sweden, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Costa Rica, and Lithuania, among others -- this combined with marked reductions in daily counts is indicative of the continued weekend reporting artifact.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 5d.6%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 2.6%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 4.1% decrease in daily reported cases and a 1.7% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported cases totaled just under 300 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 114.98 million cumulative reported cases and over 2.54 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts. Importantly, the declining 7-day averages of cases and deaths continue to shift so the 7-day average of daily newly confirmed cases is showing increases and deaths are decreasing less, suggesting the 3rd wave is gaining strength again, unconfirmed but possibly due to the impact of the variants in circulation. - Mod.MPP]
