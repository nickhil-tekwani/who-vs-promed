The public can now view a Web site showing current information about wild
bird sampling for early detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza
(HPAI) in the United States:
<http://wildlifedisease.nbii.gov/ai/>
Scientists are now using the newly developed database and Web application
called HEDDS (HPAI Early Detection Data System) to share information on
sample collection sites, bird species sampled, and test results.
The database is available to agencies, organizations, and policymakers
involved in avian influenza monitoring and response. Scientists will use
the data to assess risk and refine monitoring strategies should HPAI be
detected in the United States. Public access is more limited, but shows the
states where samples have been collected and includes numbers of samples
collected from each state.
HEDDS is a product of the federal government's NBII [National Biological
Information Infrastructure] Wildlife Disease Information Node (WDIN) housed
at the USGS National Wildlife Health Center. With financial support from
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Geological Survey, and U.S.
Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, and
participation by State wildlife agencies, universities and nongovernmental
organizations, the HEDDS Web site provides a current picture of where
sampling has taken place and the results of testing.
"HEDDS provides a critical comprehensive view of national sampling efforts
at a time when the demand for this type of information is increasing, along
with the growing interest in HPAI surveillance efforts in wild birds," said
WDIN Project Leader Joshua Dein.
Between 1 Apr and 18 Aug 2006, 9590 samples from wild birds tested for
avian influenza were entered into HEDDS. Scientists have tested over 10 000
wild birds so far. No HPAI H5N1 has been detected to date. The Eurasian
strain of H5N1 avian influenza virus has caused 141 human deaths elsewhere
in the world, as well as the death of millions of domestic and wild birds.
Low-pathogenicity strains of avian influenza are commonly found in
waterfowl and shorebirds; such strains do not cause significant disease in
wild birds or in people.
Many federal, tribal, and state agencies are involved in the U.S.
Government's national surveillance plan for the potential introduction of
HPAI into the United States from wild birds. Within the federal government,
the Department of the Interior (DOI) has the main responsibility for wild
migratory birds and thus, the primary responsibility for HPAI in wild birds
should these birds be found to be carriers of this disease.
Since the release of the wild bird surveillance plan in March 2006, DOI and
the U.S. Department of Agriculture have worked collaboratively with the 4
North American Migratory Bird Flyway Councils (Pacific, Central,
Mississippi, and Atlantic) and many states to develop local and regional
wild bird surveillance plans. As part of the surveillance and early
detection effort, HEDDS will show sample numbers in each state where
testing occurs. Most current testing is in Alaska where many of the wild
bird species targeted for surveillance nest.
Sampling has begun in many of the lower 48 states and will continue as
birds begin migrating south from their northern nesting grounds. Data from
3 of the wild bird surveillance plan's 5 strategies for early detection of
HPAI are now viewable on HEDDS: sample numbers from (1) live wild birds
tested, (2) subsistence hunter-killed birds, and (3) investigations of sick
and dead wild birds. The other 2 strategies are: (4) surveillance of
domestic birds as sentinel species; and (5) environmental sampling of water
and wild bird droppings.
The National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) is a broad,
collaborative program to provide increased access to data and information
on the nation's biological resources. The NBII links diverse, high-quality
biological databases, information products, and analytical tools maintained
by NBII partners and other contributors in government agencies, academic
institutions, non-government organizations, and private industry. A fact
sheet with more detailed information about HEDDS is available at
