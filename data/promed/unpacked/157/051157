'Shaping up to be a bad flu season:' Early cases rise in Mississippi
-------------------------------------------------------
Health officials on Monday [3 Dec 2012] said suspected flu cases have jumped in 5 southern states, and the primary strain circulating is one that tends to make people sicker, especially the elderly. "It looks like it's shaping up to be a bad flu season, but only time will tell," said Dr. Thomas Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]. The good news is the nation seems to be fairly well prepared, Frieden said. More than a third of Americans have been vaccinated, and the vaccine is well matched to the strains of flu seen so far, CDC officials said.

Higher-than-normal reports of flu have come in from Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas. An [small increase] in flu cases like this usually doesn't occur until after Christmas. "We are seeing widespread influenza activity throughout the state," said MSDH [Mississippi State Department of Health] State Epidemiologist Dr. Thomas Dobbs. "Seasonal flu usually peaks from January to March in Mississippi, but infections can be seen before and after peak season. Mississippians should take the threat of flu very seriously and get vaccinated now. It's not clear why the flu is showing up so early. But flu-related hospitalisations are rising earlier than usual, and there have already been 2 flu-related deaths in children.

In fact the last time a typical flu season started this early was the winter of 2003-04. That also happened to be a year when the dominant flu type was the same one seen most widely this year. And in that year, there were a higher-than-usual number of flu-related deaths in both the elderly and children. One key difference: In 2003-04, the flu vaccine was a poor match to the flu strain. Another [difference is] there's more vaccine now, and flu vaccination rates have risen for the general public and for key groups like pregnant women and health care workers. In all, an estimated 112 million Americans have been vaccinated so far, the CDC said. Flu vaccinations are recommended for everyone who is 6 months of age or older.

[Another forewarning of impending onset of the 2012/13 Northern Hemisphere influenza season in North America. Flu-related hospitalisations are occurring earlier than usual, and there have already been 2 flu-related deaths in children.

It is stated that there is a good match between the components of the current vaccine and the presumptive outbreak strains, but no precise data are presented identifying the individual outbreak strains nor their frequencies. A more precise analysis is awaited. - Mod.CP
