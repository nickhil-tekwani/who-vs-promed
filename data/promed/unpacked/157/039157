African swine fever outbreaks continue near Moscow
--------------------------------------------------
The African swine fever (ASF) virus has been recently detected by specialists from Rosselkhoznadzor [Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance], in pathology samples taken from a boar found mid-June in the Lihoslavlsky area of the Tver region.

At present, specialists of the State Veterinary Service and the Rosselkhoznadzor Office for the Tver and Pskov regions are carrying out numerous activities designed to prevent the spread of ASF with the aim of ultimately eliminating it. At the moment the specialists are trying to identify the possible infections pathways in the Lihoslavlsky area, where previously the virus was not detected. The State Veterinary Service is also currently conducting an estimation of all pig stock and all pig farms in the local villages.

This is the 4th outbreak of ASF in the Tula region over the past 2 months. Notably the outbreak of ASF was registered on 15 Jun 2012; on that same day quarantines installed during the previous 2 ASF outbreaks were lifted in the region. As a result regional governor Vladimir Gruzdev has banned the private purchase of new pigs in the most of the region until 1 Jul 2013. Also the pig farming in the region will be severely restricted.

According to the employees of the regional department of Rosselkhoznadzor, the Tula region is currently considered to be Russia's ASF hotspot.

Currently the department is preparing a mass cull of the wild boars, from which the samples will be sent to veterinary laboratories in order to determine how bad the situation with the spread of ASF in the wild nature really is.

[Russia's ASF epizootic started, reportedly, in December 2007 in Chechnya, starting initially in Georgia. The recent 179 outbreaks, since 11 Sep 2009, have been reported from most western parts of Russia, from Dagestan (wild boars) and the border with Georgia in the south to the Murmunskaya oblast, adjacent to Finland, in the north. For all those outbreaks, described in 85 reports, and an interactive map, see http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=8462.- Mod.AS]
