Mysterious disease claims 5 lives in western Kenya
-----------------------
An outbreak of a mysterious disease has claimed 5 lives in western Kenya
and scores of others are being treated, a health official said on Thursday.
Area medical officer of health Meshack Liru confirmed by telephone that the
5 who succumbed to the disease were workers at Cholem ADC farm who died in
a period of one week.
The disease, which has puzzled the medical staff in the 2 districts of
Trans Nzoia and Kitale, has symptoms almost similar to those of malaria
with patients experiencing severe headache and abdominal pains.
However, patients do not respond positively to treatment, and [these]
victims died after being discharged from hospital.
Liru said medical staff had been dispatched to the affected areas and 2
clinics will be set up at Cholem and Kapkoi.
A rare fever known as leptospirosis early this month has claimed the lives
of 12 people and affected nearly 180 others in the western district of Bungoma.
Charles Nzioka, head of the Disease Outbreak Management Unit in the
Ministry of Health, said leptospirosis was caused by bacteria found mostly
in the urine of rodents, and that those affected might have drunk water
contaminated with rat urine.
A team of medical experts had been sent to the affected area and was
advising people to boil their drinking water and providing them chlorinated
water, he said, noting that 86 people had been admitted to various
hospitals in the area and about 90 others discharged after treatment.

[The district of Trans Nzoia is located in the southern portion of the Rift
Valley province near the border with Kenya's Western Province and borders
Uganda. Using GIDEON (Global Infectious Disease and Epidemiology Network)
(<http://www.gideononline.org>, the top 3 possibilities for differential
diagnosis of fatal infectious disease illness associated with severe
headache and abdominal pains in Kenya are Ebola fever, typhoid fever, and
leptospirosis. Additional possibilities include shigellosis, Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever, yellow fever, malaria, and Rift Valley fever, to name a
few. ProMED-mail has recently reported on an outbreak of leptospirosis in
Bungoma district of Western Province of Kenya -- the district bordering
Trans Nzoia to the south. Other recent reports of possible significance
include the now-contained outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in Sudan, the
deaths due to aflatoxin poisoning in Makueni, Southern Province (see
postings below), and unposted newswires of increases in malaria in eastern
Uganda. Obviously, additional information on results of clinical,
epidemiological, and laboratory investigations from knowledgeable sources
would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
