[The recent detection of FMD cases in northern Israel has been seen
as indicative of an enhanced virus activity in the region. The
current Turkish report might be supportive of this view. In addition:
the World Reference FMD laboratory at Pirbright, UK has identified 15
samples, derived in October 2006 from clinical cases in Iranian
cattle, as positive for FMDV serotype O (see
<http://www.iah.bbsrc.ac.uk/virus/Picornaviridae/Aphthovirus/WRLFMD/2006/FMD2006-11.pdf>;
results of later months are not yet available on the web-site). In
addition, there are currently rumors from additional countries in the
region about suspected FMD outbreaks. Those countries are encouraged
to provide official information and to send samples of suspected
cases to Pirbright. - Mod.AS]

[A map of the outbreak area in Marmara, near the borders with Greece
and Bulgaria, is contained along with other useful information in the
WAHID interface report referenced at the beginning of this report. - Mod.PC]
