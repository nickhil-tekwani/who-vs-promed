The United States government has eased up on a rule banning the importation of dogs from 113 countries because of concerns over fraudulent rabies vaccination certificates. The change comes less than 6 weeks after the ruling, which pet owners had complained was overly restrictive, went into full effect.

As of14 Oct 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had blocked the import of dogs, both foreign and those re-entering the country after traveling abroad, from 113 countries where the risk of rabies transmission for dogs was considered high. The ban was spurred, said the federal agency, by an increase in falsified health documents from international pet importers over the past 18 months.

Now, travelers flying with dogs who received their inoculations from a US-licensed veterinarian may return to the United States from the previously banned countries, providing the animal is healthy, microchipped and at least 6 months old, and its owner can provide a valid US-issued rabies vaccination certificate. The decision was announced over the weekend on the CDC's website. The agency did not respond to questions about what had spurred the change.

In 2020 alone, as pet adoptions surged across the United States, CDC said it intervened in more than 450 cases where dogs were being imported with false or incomplete rabies vaccination certificates. In June 2021, one rabid dog was imported from Azerbaijan, prompting a public health response involving agencies in 9 states. For CDC, that one incident was enough.

The dog's importation "highlights the timeliness of CDC's temporary suspension and the risk associated with rescue dogs imported from countries at high risk for dog rabies," said Emily Pieracci, a veterinary medical officer with CDC, in an email. "Dog rabies has been eliminated from the United States since 2007 and dog importations from countries at high risk for rabies represents a significant public health risk."

Dog owners heading out of the country with their animals should make sure their paperwork is up to date and check their arrival and departure cities: CDC will not accept expired rabies vaccination certificates, and effective 1 Dec 2021, all dogs that have transited through a country deemed high risk for rabies by CDC must re-enter the United States at one of 18 approved ports of entry, including Chicago O'Hare, John F Kennedy International and San Francisco International Airports. CDC had also initially planned to reduce those 18 approved ports to only 3 in early 2022 but has now rolled back those plans [Thankfully, it should be more than 3 ports. - Mod.TG].

CDC's change of policy does not offer relief to people, including aid workers and US service members, who want to bring dogs to the United States for the 1st time. Many of them are struggling to reunite with animals they adopted during tours of duty abroad, and they have complained the rule was too restrictive. Animals adopted abroad, without US vaccination papers, are still unable to enter the United States without special permission [This is not right. There are veterinarians at many posts capable of vaccinating the pets. Furthermore, if the vaccine is specified, to be of some particular brand, then there should be no difficulty if a veterinary certificate with serial number of the vaccine is on the form. - Mod.TG]

[We are delighted to hear some of the onerous restrictions have been relaxed. However, the last paragraph of this report is still difficult in many situations. It seems particular vaccines, or stamps, or some sort of approval could be provided to service members and other travelers to verify the vaccine is an acceptable vaccine to the US officials, and the animal was properly vaccinated. We eagerly await the resolution of this last piece of restrictions for our military and citizens abroad. - Mod.TG
