[1] UK: Hospital preparedness for next surge
Date: 2 Jan 2021
Source: BBC [edited]

Hospitals across the United Kingdom are being told to prepare to face the same Covid pressures as the NHS in London and south east England. Senior doctor Professor Andrew Goddard said the virus's highly infectious new variant was spreading nationwide. Case numbers were "mild" compared with where he expected them to be next week, he said, with doctors "really worried".

It comes as a further 57 725 people have tested positive for Covid, a new daily high. This is the 5th day in a row that new daily cases have been over 50 000 and brings the total number of cases to 2 599 789. Another 445 deaths of people who had tested positive within the previous 28 days were reported on Sat 2 Jan 2021, bringing the total number of deaths to 74 570, according to government figures.

The UK-wide total for people in hospital with Covid has already passed the spring 2020 peak. Half of the major hospital trusts in England are said to be dealing with more Covid-19 patients than at the worst point of the 1st wave in April 2020, with the NHS having its "busiest winter ever".

Prof Goddard, of the Royal College of Physicians, told BBC Breakfast: "There's no doubt that Christmas [2020] is going to have a big impact; the new variant is also going to have a big impact, we know that is more infectious, more transmissible, so I think the large numbers that we're seeing in the South East, in London, in south Wales, are now going to be reflected over the next month, 2 months even, over the rest of the country." He said: "It seems very likely that we are going to see more and more cases, wherever people work in the UK, and we need to be prepared for that." Pressure has been so great on hospitals in London and south east England that some patients have been moved out of the area. London's weekly rate of coronavirus cases is 858 per 100 000 people, double the UK figure.

Dominic Harrison, director of public health for Blackburn and Darwen [in north west England. - Mod.SH], said a decision on a new lockdown had to be decided "in the next week" instead of waiting for the north to get to the same rates as the capital "and 'call it late', which has been our pattern of response too often".

The most recent UK-wide statistics, from 28 Dec 2020, showed there were 23 823 people in hospital with Covid. That was already significantly higher than the spring peak, which saw 21 683 in hospital on 12 Apr 2020. Only English hospitals have released figures for the final 3 days of December 2020, and these show that a further 2302 Covid patients were occupying hospital beds on 31 Dec 2020. London's Nightingale emergency hospital is ready to admit patients, the NHS has said, while other sites currently not in use are being readied.

Prof Goddard said it was vital the public did not "let their guard down" and continued to follow government guidelines, including wearing a face mask, maintaining social distancing, and washing hands. "Until the vaccination hits and does its job, that's what our best defense is going to be," he said.

Dr Ami Jones, an intensive care consultant in Wales, told BBC Breakfast that "hospitals are absolutely bursting," adding that a quarter of her staff were currently off sick or self-isolating, making managing patients even more challenging. "When we see the daily figures, we know that will sting us in about 10-12 days' time in the hospital. We are not even at day 10 post-Christmas yet and it's already exceedingly busy. We are going to get to the point where we physically don't have the staff to look after people safely anymore." Dr Jones also urged the public to "please just obey the rules," adding: "Stop mixing with other households because it is spreading like wildfire, and we haven't got much more space in the hospitals left."

Meanwhile, the US government's top infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, has said he does not agree with UK plans to give as many people as possible a 1st dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, while delaying 2nd doses. Dr Fauci said the US would not be adopting a similar strategy. But Professor Anthony Harnden, deputy chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, defended the move. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the vaccine "offers 90% protection for one dose" and that patients he had seen had accepted the decision, as the priority was "to get as many people vaccinated in the elderly and vulnerable community as possible." He said: "I think the country is all in this together, and I think we really, really want to pull together to try and do the best strategy possible."

[2a] UK: defence of delaying 2nd dose of vaccine
Date: 2 Jan 2021
Source: Express [edited]
https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1378760/UK-coronavirus-vaccine-news-Covid19-latest-UK-cases-US-Dr-Fauci-video-vn


The UK has decided to slow the rollout for a 2nd dose of the coronavirus vaccines in order to give more people the 1st dose of the vaccine. However, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases chief warned he did not favour the move and said the US will keep implementing their original vaccination plan.

Dr Fauci said: "We know from the clinical trial that the optimal time is to give it on day 1 then for Moderna 28 days later and for Pfizer 21 days later. You can make an argument, and some people are regarding stretching out the doses, giving a single dose across the board and then hoping you are going to get the 2nd dose in time to give to individuals." He added: "I would not be in favour of that. "We're going to keep doing what we're doing."

In a joint statement, issued on 30 Dec 2020 from Britain's chief medical officers, the prioritisation of 1st doses of the coronavirus vaccine was explained. The statement said: "It is excellent news that the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has today authorised the AstraZeneca (Oxford) vaccine for deployment across the UK."

The MHRA authorisation includes conditions the AstraZeneca (Oxford) vaccine should be administered in 2 doses, with the 2nd dose given between 4 and 12 weeks after the 1st. The MHRA has also clarified for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the interval between doses must be at least 3 weeks. They said: "For both vaccines, data provided to MHRA demonstrate that while efficacy is optimised when a 2nd dose is administered, both offer considerable protection after a single dose, at least in the short term. For both vaccines, the 2nd dose completes the course and is likely to be important for longer term protection.

The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has subsequently recommended that as many people on the JCVI priority list as possible should sequentially be offered a 1st vaccine dose as the initial priority. "They have advised that the 2nd dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine may be given between 3 to 12 weeks following the 1st dose, and that the 2nd dose of the AstraZeneca (Oxford) vaccine may be given between 4 to 12 weeks following the 1st dose.

"The clinical risk priority order for deployment of the vaccines remains unchanged and applies to both vaccines. Both are very effective vaccines. The 4 UK chief medical officers agree with the JCVI that at this stage of the pandemic, prioritising the 1st doses of vaccine for as many people as possible on the priority list will protect the greatest number of at risk people overall in the shortest possible time and will have the greatest impact on reducing mortality, severe disease and hospitalisations and in protecting the NHS and equivalent health services.

[2b] UK: defence of delaying 2nd dose of vaccine
Date: 3 Jan 2021
Source: Independent [edited]
https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/covid-vaccine-doses-pfizer-fauci-b1781455.html


A government vaccine adviser has defended plans to delay the 2nd dose of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine from 3 weeks to 12 weeks after the 1st jab, as the United States' top doctor said he disagreed with the approach. Dr Anthony Fauci, the American infectious disease expert, said the "optimal time" for patients to receive the 2nd vaccine dose is 21 days after the 1st, telling CNN he "would not be in favour" of the UK government's strategy.

Following the approval of a 2nd vaccine developed by Oxford/AstraZeneca last week, the Department of Health and Social Care said that it would prioritise giving the 1st jab to "as many people in at-risk groups. Everyone will still receive their 2nd dose, and this will be within 12 weeks of their 1st," it added in a statement. "The 2nd dose completes this course and is important for longer term protection."

The change in strategy was welcomed by some experts, but Dr Fauci told CNN: "You can make an argument, and some people are regarding stretching out the doses, giving a single dose across the board and the hoping you are going to get the 2nd dose in time to give to individuals. I would not be in favour of that."

The British Medical Association claimed it was "grossly unfair" that patients who have already received their 1st dose of the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine were having appointments cancelled due to the change in guidance.

But speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, professor Anthony Harnden, the deputy chairman of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), stressed that delaying the 2nd dose was the correct [course of action]. He said that patients he had dealt with accepted the move, adding: "When it was explained to them that the vaccine offers 90 per cent protection for one dose, and the priority was to get as many people vaccinated in the elderly and vulnerable community as possible, they understood. "I think the country is all in this together. And I think we really, really want to pull together to try and do the best strategy possible."

He insisted: "It's clear from looking at the data that the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine after one dose after 14 days is 90 per cent." Pressed on Dr Fauci's comments, he replied: "That's up to the Americans what they do; we're not saying that you shouldn't have a 2nd dose, you do need a 2nd dose, but that it can be temporarily delayed so that we can get many, many more people vaccinated in this vulnerable and elderly group as well as the clinically extremely vulnerable groups so that we get on top of this virus much quicker. We are in a dire situation in this country at the moment. The virus is rapidly spreading, and the more vaccine we can get into these priority groups that we've identified the more deaths and hospitalisations we will prevent."

More than a million people have received their 1st coronavirus vaccination, but, in a joint statement, England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty and his counterparts in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland said the public will "understand" and "thank" them for the plan to give 1st jabs as a priority, delaying the follow-up vaccination for others.

The UK is preparing to send out the new Oxford University and AstraZeneca vaccine, with 530 000 doses available for rollout from Monday [4 Jan 2021], and The Times reported that 2 million doses are due to be supplied each week by the middle of January 2021, enabling a significant scaling up of the vaccine roll-out.

[I'll repeat what I said in an earlier piece on the subject: "At present, it seems like a practical strategy to use all the available vaccine options for immunizing a maximum subset of the population, as the case numbers are extremely high in the UK at present. It remains to be seen what the impact of these multiple candidates will be in bringing down the case numbers and controlling viral transmission."

As to finding the "right" interval before administering the 2nd dose, what we know is based on data generated by clinical trials in a small group of people when compared to the mass vaccination campaigns in process. Will delaying the 2nd dose a week or 2 help the public health officials start the immunity boost in a larger subset of the population (very likely yes) or will the delay undermine the benefits of the 1st shot? These are difficult choices and decisions. Whether by expanding the vaccination "landscape", so to speak, the protection levels of the populations at risk can be improved, only time will tell. - Mod.UBA]

[3] Travel risk
Date: 1 Jan 2021
Source: San Diego Tribune [edited]

The COVID-19 death of an airline passenger, and pilots' and flight attendants' complaints about other incidents, illustrate deficiencies in the systems meant to stop people from bringing the coronavirus on flights. Before boarding a flight from Orlando to Los Angeles, IH filled out a health checklist provided by United Airlines, asserting that he had not been diagnosed with COVID-19 and had not shown any of the disease's symptoms in the previous 2 weeks. But during the flight, the 69 year old collapsed. Three passengers gave him CPR for nearly an hour in the aisle of the plane, and the flight was diverted to Louisiana, where IH was pronounced dead. The coroner's report listed the cause as "acute respiratory failure, COVID-19".

The 14 Dec 2020 incident illustrates the deficiencies in the systems that are meant to prevent people from bringing the coronavirus aboard commercial flights and potentially spreading it to the people packed in around them. And it happened as holiday air travel ramped up. In the days surrounding Christmas, more than a million passengers boarded planes almost daily, reaching 1.3 million last Sunday, the most since March 2020.

US airlines boast layers of protocols intended to protect passengers from the virus, including the increased cleaning of plane cabins and a requirement that passengers wear face coverings except when eating or drinking. Nearly all of them also require passengers to fill out a health declaration before boarding. But the only repercussion for lying on the declaration or refusing to wear a mask on the plane is getting banned from the airline if caught.

How often people with COVID-19 board planes is impossible to know. Federal regulations require airline pilots to report to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) any deaths or illnesses aboard interstate and international flights, and in March 2020, CDC updated its guidance reminding pilots of that duty. But on Thursday [31 Dec 2020], CDC told The Times that it does not keep track of the pilots' reports. The US Transportation Department and the Federal Aviation Administration said they don't keep track of COVID-19 cases on planes either.

Flight attendants are asked to be on the lookout for symptoms -- coughing, sneezing, high body temperature -- but airline representatives say they can't evaluate every passenger. Only a few airlines, such as Avianca and Frontier, take the temperature of each passenger before boarding. Some US airports, including Los Angeles International Airport, take the extra step of using thermal cameras to gauge people's temperatures as they enter the terminal, but fliers are allowed to opt out.

The CDC launched an enhanced screening program last January [2020] for international passengers arriving to the US from certain countries with widespread transmission of the virus. But it ended the program in November 2020, concluding that the effort failed, partly because COVID-19 has too many symptoms that are also common to other illnesses; travelers could mask their symptoms to avoid detection; and even travelers with no symptoms can still carry and spread the virus.

What is needed, passenger rights advocates, flight attendant unions, and academics say, is for the US Department of Transportation to adopt uniform standards for airline safety, including a mask mandate that is enforced with steep fines. They also call on the federal agency to put more resources into contact tracing of known cases and improved access to quick and reliable COVID-19 tests that passengers can take before a flight.

"Without health security rules by [the Transportation Department], air travel will continue to spread COVID," said Paul Hudson, president of Flyersrights.org, an airline passenger rights group with more than 60 000 members. The Trump administration has been reluctant to impose airline screening and safety requirements, opting instead to let each carrier and airport create and enforce their own individual policies. "Unless that message is coming from the top, it's really hard to take action," said Jan L Jones, a professor of hospitality and tourism at the University of New Haven.

The tragedy on the 14 Dec 2020 United Airlines flight was only the latest reported incident in which a passenger boarded a plane despite showing COVID-19 symptoms or testing positive for the coronavirus. In late November 2020, a Hawaii couple who tested positive for the virus were told to isolate in San Francisco but instead boarded a plane to Kauai, where they were arrested on suspicion of reckless endangerment, police said. Several other incidents involving passengers who showed COVID-19 symptoms on flights have been reported to an aviation safety reporting database operated by NASA. The reports in the database are filed anonymously by pilots and flight attendants, with the exact dates and airlines' names omitted to protect the tipsters' privacy.

The database was created so NASA can report safety problems to aviation manufacturers and operators without putting those companies' employees at risk of reprisal for flagging the problems.

According to a report in the database filed in October 2020, the pilot of a commercial flight was alerted to a female passenger who complained of extreme pain while the plane was at cruising altitude. The pilot offered to divert the flight to the nearest airport to get her immediate medical attention, but she said she was feeling better after an EMT [emergency medical technician] on the flight gave her oxygen. "While she received attention on the plane, the passenger stated that she had been exposed to COVID in the last 3 days," the pilot said in the report, which offered few other details.

On a flight in May 2020, a pilot reported being notified by a flight attendant that a male passenger was "coughing, sneezing, not wearing a mask, and he refused to wear a mask despite repeated attempts by her to give him one." The plane had just pulled away from the gate, the pilot reported. The flight attendants also said that other passengers were starting to panic because the coughing passenger had gotten up about 5 times to use the lavatory, the pilot wrote. "During a global pandemic, a visibly sick passenger was able to get through check-in, security, walk through the terminal, past a gate agent, and onto an airplane with other passengers and crew members," the pilot wrote.

In August 2020, a pilot reported that just before departure, a flight attendant said a passenger was coughing, not wearing a mask, and had just vomited on himself. "I made the decision that the person was not suitable for a [long] flight and was to be removed," the pilot said in the report.

In other incidents, pilots and flight attendants fault their colleagues and employers. A pilot reported to the database in September 2020 that a flight attendant had been feeling ill but had not disclosed her symptoms to the pilot or other crewmates. She later tested positive for COVID-19, the pilot said. "Lack of communication and transparency from the [flight attendant] about her pre-existing health condition led to the compromised safety of passengers and fellow flight crew," the pilot wrote.

In April 2020, 2 flight attendants reported that even though a passenger on one of their recent flights had tested positive for the coronavirus, their airline ordered them to show up for duty a few days later. "The company refused to give us alternate travel despite being potential carriers," one of the flight attendants wrote in their report in the NASA database. "We were not granted assurance of tests upon landing, or that we would be given leave to quarantine for the full recommended 14 days to allow for symptoms to manifest or not."

[The data on air travel-associated COVID-19 transmission indicate that risk of contracting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during air travel is lower than from an office building, classroom, supermarket, or commuter train. This is based on the fact that the airflow in current jet airliners is much faster than normal indoor buildings. Half of it is fresh air from outside, the other half is recycled through HEPA filters of the same type used in operating rooms. Any remaining risk to be managed is from contact with other passengers who might be infectious. Seat backs provide a partial physical barrier, and most people remain relatively still, with little face-to-face contact [https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2771435].

The risk can be minimized further at airports and on board by various measures such as temperature checks and/or asking about symptoms (fever, loss of sense of smell, chills, cough, shortness of breath); enhanced cleaning and disinfection; contactless boarding/baggage processing; use of physical barriers and sanitization in airports; physical distancing in airports and during boarding; use of face coverings or masks; separation between passengers on board when feasible; adjustment of food and beverage service to reduce contact; control of access to aisles and bathrooms to minimize contact; limiting exposure of crew members to infection; and facilitation of contact tracing in the event that a passenger develops infection.

Additional steps being implemented include mandatory preflight testing for COVID-19 (within 72-96 hours before departure) and adjustments to quarantine requirements etc.

Passengers can take different steps for their protection, including wearing a mask, canceling or defering travel if they feel unwell, and limiting carry-on baggage. Keep distance from others wherever possible; report to staff if someone is clearly unwell. Stay seated if possible, and follow crew instructions. Wash or sanitize hands frequently and avoid touching the face. - Mod.UBA]

ref: Myoung‐Hwa Lee, Daniel P Perl, Govind Nair, Wenxue Li, Dragan Maric, Helen Murray, et al. Microvascular injury in the brains of patients with Covid-19 (letter). N Engl J Med. 2020; Dec 30: DOI: 10.1056/NEJMc2033369.
"We conducted postmortem high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance microscopy) of the brains of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) (median age, 50 years) and histopathological examination that focused on microvascular changes in the olfactory bulb and brain stem. (See the Materials and Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org.) Images were obtained from the brains of 13 patients with the use of an 11.7-Tesla scanner at a resolution of 25 um for the olfactory bulb and at a resolution of 100 um for the brain. Abnormalities were seen in the brains of 10 patients. We examined the brains of patients that showed abnormalities by means of multiplex fluorescence imaging (in 5 patients) and by means of chromogenic immunostaining (in 10 patients). We performed conventional histopathological examination of the brains of 18 patients. 14 patients had chronic illnesses, including diabetes and hypertension, and 11 had been found dead or had died suddenly and unexpectedly. Of the 16 patients with available medical histories, one had delirium, 5 had mild respiratory symptoms, 4 had acute respiratory distress syndrome, 2 had pulmonary embolism, and the symptoms were not known in 3 (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).

"Magnetic resonance microscopy showed punctate hyperintensities in 9 patients, which represented areas of microvascular injury and fibrinogen leakage. These features were observed on corresponding histopathological examination performed with the use of fluorescence imaging (Figure 1A and 1B). These areas showed thinning of the basal lamina of the endothelial cells, as determined by collagen IV immunostaining in 5 patients (Fig. 1B1 and 1B2). Punctate hypointensities on imaging in 10 patients corresponded to congested blood vessels (Figure 1C) with surrounding areas of fibrinogen leakage (Figure 1D and Fig. S1) and relatively intact vasculature (Figure 1E). Areas of linear hypointensities were interpreted as microhemorrhages (Figure 1F and Fig. S2). There was minimal perivascular inflammation in the specimens examined, but there was no vascular occlusion, as previously described in the Journal. [1]

"Perivascular-activated microglia, macrophage infiltrates, and hypertrophic astrocytes were seen in 13 patients (Figure 1G and 1H, Fig. S3, and Table S4). [2] There were CD3+ and CD8+ T cells in the perivascular spaces and in lumens adjacent to endothelial cells in 8 patients, which may have contributed to vascular injury (Figure 1I and 1J), as suggested in a previous report. [3] Activated microglia were found adjacent to neurons in 5 patients, which is suggestive of neuronophagia in the olfactory bulb, substantia nigra, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagal nerve, and the pre-Botzinger complex in the medulla, which is involved in the generation of spontaneous rhythmic breathing (Figure 1K through 1N and Fig. S3).

"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was not detected by means of polymerase chain reaction with multiple primer sets, RNA sequencing of several areas of the brain, or RNA in situ hybridization and immunostaining (Table S5). It is possible that the virus was cleared by the time of death or that viral copy numbers were below the level of detection by our assays.

"In a convenience sample of patients who had died from Covid-19, multifocal microvascular injury was observed in the brain and olfactory bulbs by means of magnetic resonance microscopy, histopathological evaluation, and immunohistochemical analysis of corresponding sections, without evidence of viral infection. These findings may inform the interpretation of changes observed on magnetic resonance imaging of punctate hyperintensities and linear hypointensities in patients with Covid-19. Because of the limited clinical information that was available, no conclusions can be drawn in relation to neurologic features of Covid-19."

Earlier work by I H Solomon and colleagues based on histopathological staining of brain tissue from COVID-19 patients' brains have reported evidence of hypoxic injury in the cerebrum and cerebellum in all the patients, with loss of neurons in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellar Purkinje cell layer, but no thrombi or vasculitis [https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2019373?query=featured_coronavirus] with detection of virus at low levels in only 6 brain sections obtained from 5 out of 18 patients included in the study.

The above study reports on MRI findings in the COVID-19 patients, which seem to somewhat corroborate the earlier study data. However, since full clinical data are not available, no concrete deductions can be made on the full impact of COVID-19 associated neurological injury and its correlation with clinical presentation or most appropriate investigational tools. - Mod.UBA]

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (232 227), UK (57 725), and Russia (26 301) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 8448 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (1-2 Jan 2021).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (11 countries) include the USA, UK, Russia, India (21 222), Brazil (15 827), South Africa (15 002), Italy (11 831), Colombia (11 528), Turkey (11 180), Mexico (11 091), and Germany (11 015). A total of 46 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 23 of the 46 countries that reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 10 are from the Americas region, 8 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 2 are from the Western Pacific region, and one from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 3.8%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 7.7%.

Impression: The global daily reported cases are over 600 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours and over 84 million cumulative reported cases with almost 1.84 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, even with reductions in daily case reports due to the period, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, South East Asia, and Western Pacific regions. - Mod.UBA]
