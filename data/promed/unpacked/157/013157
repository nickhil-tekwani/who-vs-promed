The Chippewa County Department of Public Health reports that 3 horses
in the county have died from eastern equine encephalitis (EEE).

The Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (WVDL) recently
reported the positive test results to the Wisconsin Division of Public
Health (WDPH). These are the county's 1st documented cases of the EEE
mosquito-borne disease this year [2011].

"These findings confirm that there are mosquitoes in the area infected
with EEE virus. These same mosquitoes could bite people and possibly
infect them," said Jean Durch, Health Officer. "Even though it is
getting cooler outdoors, Chippewa County residents need to continue to
use personal protective measures to prevent mosquito bites."

EEE is a viral disease transmitted by a bite of an infected mosquito
to humans, horses, birds, and other animals. Mosquitoes acquire the
virus by feeding on infected birds. The virus is not transmitted
directly between animals or between animals and humans. The EEE virus
may be transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito that
may cause a rare neurological illness in humans. Only one case of
human EEE infection has been reported in Wisconsin since 1984.

Most people infected with EEE virus may not have any symptoms.
However, a few people infected with EEE virus may experience symptoms
involving encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) that begins with
sudden onset of fever, headache, chills, and vomiting. It is important
that people contact their health care provider if these symptoms
develop, because the illness may become severe, resulting in
disorientation, seizures, coma, or death. There is no specific
treatment for this illness.

The Health Department offers these recommendations to avoid mosquito
exposure:

- Maintain window screens in good repair to decrease indoor contact
with mosquitoes.

- Wear protective clothing such as long pants, loose-fitting
long-sleeved shirts.

- When outdoors, consider using an effective mosquito repellent
(follow instructions). For CDC repellents information, go to:
http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/qa/insect_repellent.htm.

- Do not provide a breeding ground for mosquitoes; remove containers,
old tires, unused wading pools, old bird bath water, and any objects
where water can collect and mosquitoes can lay eggs.

- Trim tall grass, weeds and vines since mosquitoes use these places
to rest during hot daylight hours.

- Clean gutters and downspouts to ensure they drain properly.

Durch said the report should serve as a reminder for horse owners to
vaccinate their animals.

"This should be part of horse owners' normal vaccine regimen every
year." In addition to vaccination, owners can protect their horses by
removing standing water and keeping animals inside from dusk to dawn.
EEE signs in horses include depression, loss of appetite, drooping
eyelids and lower lip, blindness, and paralysis. Fever is not a
frequent clinical sign in horses.

[Mosquitoes can be almost anywhere. Protection of animals from
mosquitoes is important, and vaccines against this disease exist for
horses. It is important that horse owners vaccinate annually, and in
areas likely to have the disease, such as states along the coastal
areas, then vaccination may need to be more frequent, such as twice a
year.

Hurricanes that move up the coastlines and reach some ways inland with
winds and rain may also serve to transport mosquitoes and the diseases
they carry to other regions. - Mod.TG]
