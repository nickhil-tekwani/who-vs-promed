Gold Coasters have been put on alert after a bat was found to be infected with a disease that's potentially fatal to humans.

A red flying fox was recovered from Albert Park on Monaco Street in Broadbeach and since tested positive for the Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV). It was discovered on Wed 3 Feb [2021] around 4:00 p.m.

Anyone who may have had contact with this bat is now being urged to get to the doctor and ask them to contact the Public Health Unit immediately.

Public Health Physician Dr Vicki Slinko says the ABLV infection can be fatal to humans.

"The bat was found just off the pathway at the northern end of the Albert Waterways Park near the underpass for Monaco Street at about 4 p.m. on Wednesday, 3 Feb [2021]," Slinko said. "It was taken into care by appropriately trained and vaccinated carers.

"The sick bat was tested for ABLV and was found to be positive. This result was notified to Queensland Health, and relevant follow-up was undertaken by the Gold Coast Public Health Unit.

"We have been in contact with those people who reported the bat when it was found, and those who cared for it, to check on the details of any contact they had with the bat and whether they were vaccinated. Once the bat was rescued, it was handled only by trained and vaccinated carers.

"It is very important to provide urgent treatment if anyone has had a scratch or bite from a bat to prevent a lethal disease."

Gold Coasters are being reminded that bats should not be handled by members of the public under any circumstances even if [the bats] appear dead.

[Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) is a potentially lethal zoonotic virus. It was first identified in 1996 and has been found in several species of flying foxes and bats in Australia. A few human deaths have been reported due to this virus, generally associated with history of contact with flying foxes or other bats.

Flying foxes belong to the genus _Pteropus_, and they are the largest bats in the world. There are several species. For a picture of the impressive flying fox go to http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2014/10/23/1227099/171906-2db3277e-5999-11e4-bb41-d2d878d2a380.jpg.

Education of the public to avoid manipulating bats may prove an effective preventative measure.
