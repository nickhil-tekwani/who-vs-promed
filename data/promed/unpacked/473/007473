Ten people have been hospitalized in Russia's Altai territory over suspected exposure to anthrax, according to local emergency officials.

Earlier, officials reported that at least one person had died on Saturday [25 Aug 2012] from anthrax poisoning, while 3 others from the village of Druzhba were confirmed infected. A total of 7 had been hospitalized for tests, officials said. The victim became infected after handling the carcass of an infected cow. Doctors said he sought medical aid only a week after developing symptoms [With anthrax, delay equals death. - Mod.MHJ].

A total of 32 people in the Altai territory are believed to have come into contact with infected animals, all of whom are under medical supervision, according to officials.

Druzhba, population 740, was quarantined, and vaccination was ordered for all animals. Stray animals are also being killed to contain the outbreak.

[These extra cases are to be expected, as the contaminated meat from the butchered animals would have been distributed throughout the village.

This account has some misinformation on the treatment of clinical cases. It is now clear with humans that there must be an aggressive policy of removing any fluids containing the anthrax toxins, whether from a wound, abdominal cavity, or thorax. One cannot depend just on antibiotics at that point. - Mod.MHJ
