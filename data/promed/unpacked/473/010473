BURNS: About 600 cattle have died on high desert ranches in Harney County
in a fungal poisoning outbreak linked to persistent drought in south
eastern Oregon and field-burning practices in the Willamette Valley.
Veterinarian Leon Pielstick of Burns said "fescue foot", or endophyte
toxicosis, spread to the cattle from fescue grass hay, killing the animals
or forcing ranchers to destroy them.
Near Silverton, 2 cases of fescue foot also occurred in Marion County, said
Linda Blythe, associate dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine at
Oregon State University. "It was multiple animals, but it wasn't anything
like the problem we've had in eastern Oregon."
The disease constricts blood flow to the feet and legs of cattle, causing
frostbite and gangrene during winter weather, said Pielstick. In many
cases, the animals' feet simply fall off. The Harney County outbreak
occurred in 3 herds on 2 cattle operations, and warmer temperatures have
largely brought it to an end, said Pielstick. "The ranchers discovered
there was a problem and quit feeding the hay," he said. "For 6 weeks after
they quit feeding, they continued to have cows breaking out with signs."
Some of the dead animals went to rendering plants, but most were buried, he
said. The outbreak grew out of an unusual convergence of factors, said
Pielstick and Blythe. One was the persistent drought that made it
impossible for many Harney County ranchers to produce enough hay last
summer for their cattle, forcing them to buy from outside the area. Another
was the ready availability of tall fescue that is a byproduct of the
grass-seed industry in the Willamette Valley, said Pielstick. Because of
restrictions on field burning, grass-seed producers, who once got rid of
their straw by burning it in the fields after harvest, have been selling it
for livestock feed, he said.
Blythe said grass-seed producers actually prefer high levels of endophyte
because the fungus provides resistance against insects, disease and
drought."It is bred into the plant," she said. "It doesn't transfer from
plant to plant... ...If you are wanting to plant grass for a park or a golf
course, that's exactly what you want."
Endophyte poses no health risks to humans because the fungus does not
accumulate in animals, said Blythe. One solution for livestock growers is
to mix fescue straw with alfalfa hay so the endophyte levels are diluted,
she said. Another is to have fescue straw tested before it's fed to cattle.
Pielstick said the potential for fescue foot among cattle has been known
since the 1970s. But why such a deadly outbreak occurred this year has
puzzled many in Harney County. Tests of uneaten fescue hays only deepened
the mystery, he said, because high levels of the fungus were not found. "We
never tested anything that was highly toxic -- nothing," Pielstick said.
"We expected to find tons of really (toxic) hay, and we did not find that."
One rancher mixed untested fescue 50-50 with alfalfa and still lost 100 of
his 300 cows, while another herd that was fed 90 per cent fescue had a
similar death rate, said Pielstick. Another possibility is cattle may have
been weakened by the drought and were more susceptible to fescue foot this
winter than in other years, said Pielstick. He also suspects some cattle
may have eaten more fescue than others when fescue and alfalfa were mixed,
he said.
Fescue comes into Harney County in 20 ton shipments arranged between hay
brokers and ranchers, said Pielstick. Each load could originate in several
fields having varying endophyte levels, he said. That is one reason he
would feed his own cattle alfalfa, which he considers safer and a better
dollar value, he said. "Ranchers are always in a tight budget squeeze --
everybody is," Pielstick said. "If I were a rancher, I would test every
load. . . . If you are going to buy it, test every load."
