Heavy rains and beginning floods can result in an increased number of fleeing rodents, as mentioned by the moderator, resulting in yet another health risk and provoking localized outbreaks of similar symptoms after a similar incubation time of 7-10 days, such as with hantavirus infections.

Hantaviruses are spread to humans by aerosolized excreta of chronically infected rodents, which act as both reservoirs and carriers. In India, the only known rodent carrier of pathogenic hantaviruses is the wild rat (_Rattus rattus_ or _R. norvegicus_), carrying the only globally spread hantavirus species, called _Seoulvirus_ (SEOV), a result of the worldwide spread of the wild rat.

Moreover, of all pathogenic hantavirus species, SEOV has the most pronounced tendency to induce liver involvement, besides kidney and/or lung involvement. In the initial phase, this can result in easily detectable diarrhea, gastroenteritis, and jaundice, as noted in Gujarat, before the more unapparent renal and/or pulmonary impairment arise, which, however, can also occur in leptospirosis.

Detecting, by means of specific serology, the difference between hantavirus disease, a viral, rodent-borne zoonosis, and its great mimicker, leptospirosis, a bacterial and again (mainly) rodent-borne zoonosis, is of prime importance, because only the latter is treatable with antibiotics, and because the clinical picture is undistinguishable, even with a kidney biopsy.

Failures of antibiotic treatment for leptospirosis are due, in most cases, to an administration of antibiotics too late in the clinical course but can also be attributed to a misdiagnosis, whereby the right underlying problem is, in fact, a missed hantavirus infection. Moreover, double concomitant human leptospirosis-hantavirus (SEOV) infections have also been reported, caused by the same rodent reservoir, the wild rat. So, in theory, a meticulous serological lab should always perform additional serological and/or RT-PCR testing for SEOV after positive findings for leptospirosis, particularly so in (sub)tropical regions.

India is a subcontinent heavily endemic for leptospirosis but where, up to now, only a very few SEOV cases have been documented so far serologically, despite the fact that the SEOV-rodent carrier, the wild rat, is omnipresent. A related murine rodent species, _Bandicota indica_, is likewise present and a carrier of another hantaviral pathogen, _Thailand virus_ (THAIV), of which, however, to our knowledge, no clinical cases have been documented so far in India.

Finally, fatal hantavirus cases with both severe kidney and lung involvement have been noted in south India, giving mainly _Puumalavirus_ (PUUV) reactions both in ELISA and immunoblot. However, PUUV is endemic only in Europe and European Russia due to the local presence of its rodent reservoir _Myodes glareolus_, which is completely absent in India. Thus, we have probably to deal with cross-reactions with an as yet unknown new hantavirus species in an as yet unknown rodent (or insectivore?) carrier in India. (Clement J, Maes P, Muthusethupathi M, Nainan G, Van Ranst M. First evidence of fatal hantavirus nephropathy in India, mimicking leptospirosis. Nephrol Dial Transpl 2006; 21: 826-7. http://ndt.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/21/3/826?etoc). It should be remembered, however, that the 1st "new" fatal hantaviruses, discovered in 1993 in the New World (Four Corners, USA), were also 1st detected in the lab thanks to their serological cross-reactions with PUUV.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Clement for this interesting assessment of the outbreak in Vadodara, Gujarat, India. As also pointed out by Dr. Jan Clement in a prior ProMED-mail post "Leptospirosis - Jamaica (02) 20071018.3409," leptospirosis can mimic the clinical manifestations of hantavirus infection (1). Both diseases are transmitted by rats that can be unleashed by heavy rainfall. Dr. Clement and colleagues of the National Reference Laboratory for Hantavirus Infections, University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium found evidence of hantavirus infection in India mimicking leptospirosis (2).

We await a more detailed description of the clinical manifestations in this outbreak, laboratory testing of infected individuals, and results of the ongoing epidemiologic investigations.

Dr. Clement makes a valid point about the need to include Seoul and other hantaviruses in diagnostic tests dealing with these types of outbreaks. It is important to consider that these outbreaks may be due to mixed infections, with more than one pathogen involved. - Mods.TY/ML
