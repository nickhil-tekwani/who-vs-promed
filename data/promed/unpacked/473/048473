A seasonal rise of acute intestinal infections has been reported in
Penza. In addition to viral gastroenteritis caused by enteroviruses
and rotaviruses, infections caused by noroviruses have been recorded.
Noroviruses were detected for the 1st time in Penza in 2006.
During a single week in December [2006] about 160 cases of acute
intestinal diseases in adults and up to 70 cases in children were
caused by various viral gastrointestinal agents. Twenty cases were
diagnosed as norovirus infections, although the actual number may
have been be much greater.
"It must be assumed that a few [norovirus-infected] individuals
visited Penza and were the primary sources of the virus, to which the
local population had no prior exposure or immunity", stated Michael
Baev, a departmental head in Rospoptrebnadzor [the Federal Service
for Supervision of Consumer Rights and Welfare Protection] in Penza.
All viral intestinal diseases, including norovirus infections, have
similar symptoms, and physicians recommend immediate medical aid.
Noroviruses are extremely contagious, but sources of infection can
include fecal contamination of water supplies as happened at School
No. 67 in Penza [in 2006]. Viral gastroenteritis can be particularly
severe in children and the elderly. Frequent hand-washing and general
cleanliness is essential to contain infection and reduce the risk of
transmission of disease.
