Troops taken ill with 'winter vomiting bug'
---------------------------------------------
The mystery illness that has struck British troops serving in Afghanistan
is believed to be the so-called winter vomiting bug.
Several positive diagnoses of the disease, also known as Norwalk-like
virus, have been made, and although tests are not complete on all those
affected it is "highly likely" it is to blame.
The strain is "virtually identical" to the bug which swept Britain earlier
this year, a source says.
The harsh conditions faced by troops in Afghanistan, particularly
dehydration caused by the heat, produced more extreme symptoms than the
disease has in the UK, confusing experts, the source adds.
However there is "no suggestion" the British forces had taken the disease
with them to the Royal Marines' Bagram airbase.
The disease is thought to have hit 25 UK troops, with others presenting
milder symptoms, who are thought to be suffering from more common diarrhea
bugs.
The disease had been confirmed in two cases by the Public Health Laboratory
and it was "highly likely" that it had affected the other 23 with serious
symptoms, the source said.
The virus is extremely similar to that which caused major problems in
British hospitals earlier this year, according to a Ministry of Defence
medical expert.
"If not identical is it virtually identical," he said.
Fresh food, brought in by civilian contracts through Pakistan, is a
possible cause. This will be examined in an investigation into the
outbreak, a defence source said.

Soldiers hit by 'stomach bug'
----------------------------------
Prague - The mystery illness which has struck British soldiers serving in
Afghanistan was identified by Czech military doctors on Saturday as
dysentery caused by shigella bacteria.
"It is a dysentery caused by shigella bacteria. There is no mystery," said
Colonel Jindrich Sitta, the commander of the Czech military hospital in
Afghanistan, who was quoted in Dnes newspaper.
Shigella infects the mucous lining of the colon, causing inflammation.
Epidemics occur regularly in parts of the world with poor hygiene
standards, with the disease being spread by diarrhea, contaminating water,
unwashed hands, as well as by flies.
Illness caused by shigella bacteria normally last at least a week, but can
last longer.
Sitta said that the Czech hospital will take over some of the functions of
the British military hospital on Monday.
The hospital and over 300 British troops, have been placed under quarantine
since the contagious illness struck.
On Saturday a British military spokesperson, Lieutenant-Colonel Ben Curry
said that 39 personnel had been affected although only 15 were in need of
treatment.
Symptoms of the disease include diarrhea and vomiting.
A total of nine servicemen have been flown out of Bagram since the outbreak
of the disease. One was flown to Germany while the rest were sent to Britain.
"Those medivacked back to the UK are still listed as very seriously ill but
we have been encouraged by reports that they have stabilized," Curry said.
The spokesperson told reporters that two doctors, both experts in
communicable diseases, were due to arrive at this coalition air base over
the weekend.
He said it was still too early to classify the disease but an initial
theory that it might be a type of meningitis had now been ruled out.
"The doctors believe, given the symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting, that we
are dealing with... a form of stomach bug. Unfortunately that's an
occupational hazard in this part of the world.
"The strange thing seems to be that some people are affected more than
others. At the moment we cannot determine why that is."

[As shigellosis is a bacterial etiology and Norwalk-like virus (NLV) is a
viral etiology we have 2 very different etiologies hypothesized
here. Readers are reminded that this has been an exceptional year for NLV
in the UK, with widespread outbreaks resulting in many school and hospital
closures, the latter due to outbreaks with transmission within the
hospitals (see ProMED-mail postings referenced below).
While it is possible to have 2 concurrent gastrointestinal outbreaks
ongoing in the same population, one does wonder why the identification of
_shigella sp_ bacteria took several days, if it was the predominant
organism responsible for this outbreak.
Would someone in the know out there please be kind enough to send
ProMED-mail official information on this outbreak and help clarify the
ongoing confusion. - Mod.MPP]
