A 6-year-old girl had been infected with [influenzavirus H5N1, but
recovered, officials said Saturday, bringing to 17 the number of confirmed
cases of the ailment that has killed four people. The child made a full
recovery before the slaughter of the territory's 1.3 million chickens in an
attempt to wipe out the ailment, the government said. It said a blood test
had shown that the girl had been infected with [influenzavirus A H5N1 and
had developed antibodies. Authorities suspect [all the victims caught the
disease by handling infected chickens or their waste. No human cases have
been diagnosed since the chicken slaughter more than a week ago. On Friday,
legislators approved a $97 million compensation package for the poultry
industry, which has been devastated by the bird flu outbreak. Officials
also said the 3-week-old ban on live chicken imports is likely to stretch
through January.
