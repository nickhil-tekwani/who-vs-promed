Authorities are currently inquiring about a possible case of a hantavirus infection in Corral, in the Los Ríos region, after the death of a worker from Aysén who was in the area.

This occurred after an alert issued by the Aysén SEREMI [Secretaría Regional Ministerial de Salud; local health ministerial unit], that through a public statement, indicated that the case is a 35-year-old man who apparently died from the virus [infection], which must be confirmed by the Public Health Institute.

According to details from Aysén, an epidemiological investigation was initiated in order to determine where the victim was infected, suspecting that it was in the Huape locality, near Corral, where he was working in dismantling an old house and clearing weeds in a rural sector, moving to the Puyuhuapi locality on [Sat 20 Jan 2018], to reinitiate his work activities in that place.

This was communicated by the Aysén Health SEREMI Willy Velasquez.

In Los Ríos, his health counterpart, Claudio Mendez, said that they are carrying out the corresponding investigations; however, they have still not confirmed if Corral is the location where the infection was acquired.

Both authorities have called for preventive measures to be taken, such as ventilating for 30 minutes spaces that have been closed for a long time, camping in areas that are authorized and cleared. Also, do not hike on enclosed trails that could favor the presence of long-tailed rats, which is the focus of the [host] that transmits [Andes] hantavirus.

[The specific situation under which the individual acquired his hantavirus infection is not confirmed. He likely came into contact with areas inhabited by the rodent reservoir of the virus, perhaps in the old house that he was demolishing.

Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, including the Los Ríos region, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and if it does is only with very close physical contact, usually within the family. The commonest source of the infection is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg. - Mod.TY
