4 more cases of E. coli have been confirmed in Missouri since Friday morning, 13 Apr 2012, bringing the total number of cases in the state to 13. 3 of the 13 cases were reported from Boone County, said Gena Terlizzi, public information officer for the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. The remaining cases were split up between Cooper and Howard counties with 3 each and Camden, Clark and Jackson counties with 1 each. The location of the most recent case, for which information was released around 6 p.m., has not yet been disclosed.

7 of the 13 people with the bacteria have been tested and found to have matching strains, and 3 more have pending results, expected next week. Of the 7 cases with matching patterns, 5 people have reported the consumption of raw dairy products from the same farm. 3 additional cases are under investigation for which laboratory reports are not available.

A 2-year-old girl has reportedly developed the syndrome. Another 1-year-old child, previously reported as possibly having the syndrome, was tested and did not.

The health advisory states that there is no proof of any benefits that raw milk offers. It also states that the major nutrients in milk are not affected by pasteurization and that raw milk can actually grow harmful bacteria. Missouri currently has one permitted facility, located in Galena, that has obtained the proper permit for retail sale of raw dairy products, according to the Missouri Department of Agriculture.

Only certain jurisdictions permit sales, and producers and processors wishing to sell raw milk or cream at farmers' markets have to first apply to the Missouri State Milk Board for a permit. Only after complying with regulations pertaining to proper bottling, capping and labeling can they then sell raw milk products, according to the Department of Agriculture's code of state regulations.

Graded raw milk may not be sold in retail stores under these regulations. Missouri law specifically allows an individual farmer to sell raw milk or cream in Missouri if it's purchased at the farm where it was produced or if delivered to the customer for his or her own personal use, according to the health advisory. The regulations also state that each local health department should follow its own discretion with regard to selling raw milk at farmers' markets. Many local health departments follow the Food and Drug Administration Food Code.
