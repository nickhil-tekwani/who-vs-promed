A 10-year-old girl could have to undergo a kidney transplant after contracting _E. coli_ on a holiday in Egypt, her family has said. The girl, from Queenborough, Kent, picked up the bug while on a trip to the Red Sea resort of Hurghada in May 2016. She spent a week on life support and is now dependent on immune suppressant drugs and 12 hours of dialysis a day. Tour operator Thomson said the family had not contacted them but it closely [monitors] hygiene at its resorts.

The girl was rushed to hospital in London just 24 hours after returning to the UK, Her symptoms were initially diagnosed in Egypt as an upset stomach, but 24 hours after landing in the UK her organs began to shut down. Her mother said: "Her kidneys stopped working. Her heart stopped working. They said it was like having a heart attack for 5 days."

The mother said they were hoping the kidneys would recover from the damage but the "worst case scenario" was dialysis at home and "a transplant further down the line".

[Although not stated, the severity of illness here suggests an enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC). Significant multiorgan failure can occur after the hypotension which may occur with a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) that may accompany an _E. coli_ infection with bacteremia and acute renal injury can occur associated with significant hypovolemia with severe diarrhea.

As stated in an earlier post today, although in almost 500 postings on ProMED-mail on _E. coli_, mostly EHEC, there is not one regarding the infection being acquired in Africa (until today when there are 2), it is likely that many are not being diagnosed there except, for the most part, in travelers returning to Europe or America. Although kidney damage serious enough to require dialysis can develop if severe dehydration or hypotension occur from _E. coli_ bacteremia or severe diarrhea, it is likely that this case represents enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ acquired in West Africa.
