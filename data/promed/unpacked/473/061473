Confirmed cases of Lassa fever have previously been reported in Liberia for more than 5 years. Between 2016 and 2020, a total of 168 confirmed cases including 70 deaths were reported (case fatality rate 42.0%) in 7 out of the 15 counties in Liberia. During the same period, the number of cases per year ranged from 14 in 2016 to 52 in 2020.

The 1st confirmed case in 2021 was reported in week 3 (ending 24 Jan 2021) in a 39-year-old male, resident of Phebe Airstrip, Bong County, who had symptom onset of illness on 10 Jan 2021. The case was admitted at Phebe Hospital on 11 Jan 2021, where a specimen was collected and sent to the National Public Health Reference Laboratory (NPHRL) on the same day. The case died on 12 Jan 2021 and a safe burial was conducted. Laboratory result confirmed him positive for Lassa virus on 17 Jan 2021. From this case, 21 contacts including 18 health workers were identified, line-listed and followed up.

The 2nd confirmed case was a 38-year-old female resident of MIE Field, who presented with red eyes, general body weakness, poor appetite, sore throat, vomiting, and coughing on 1 Mar 2021 and was unresponsive to treatment. Based on the suspicion for Lassa fever, the case patient was admitted and isolated at Liberia Agricultural Company hospital in Grand Bassa County on 4 Mar 2021. A specimen was collected on 6 Mar 2021 and tested positive on 8 Mar 2021 following her death on 7 Mar [2021].

The recent confirmed case was reported on 5 Jul 2021 from Nimba County in a 27-year-old female who first exhibited symptoms on 3 Jul 2021. She sought medical treatment at Ganta United Methodist Hospital on the same day, where she was isolated with complaints of high fever, stomach pains, red eyes, joint pains, nausea, and vomiting. The case died on 9 Jul 2021 and a safe and dignified burial was conducted by the district health team. Laboratory results were positive on 12 Jul 2021. A total of 11 contacts all healthcare workers were listed. The case had no epi-link to the other confirmed cases neither a travel history to affected county or attended funeral service of a confirmed Lassa fever case. A total of 60 contacts from Bong and Nimba Counties are currently under follow-up.

Confirmed cases reported between 1 Jan and 18 Jul 2021 are associated with higher CFR compared to the previous 5 years. Within this period, a total of 71 suspected cases were reported, of which 13 (18.3%) were confirmed, and 9 deaths among confirmed cases (CFR: 69%). The confirmed cases originated from 4 counties; namely Bong (3), Grand Bassa (4), Montserrado (1), and Nimba (5). Females account for the highest number of the confirmed cases (7 cases, 54%) compared with males (6 cases, 46%). Of the 13 confirmed cases, 3 (23.1%) were within the age range of 0-15 years, 5 (38.5%) cases within 16-30 years, 3 (23.1%) cases within 31-45 years, and 2 (15.4%) cases 46 years and older.

Public health actions
---------------------
- Upon confirmation of one case, incident management and emergency operations centres have been activated in all response counties.
- The National Lassa Fever Action Plan (multiple counties affected), and national level incident management is being activated.
- Inter-county surveillance meetings with neighbouring counties are planned by the county health teams.
- A total of 60 contacts are currently under follow-up (20 from Bong County and 40 from Nimba County. Of the 40 contacts from Nimba County, 11 are from the current case and 29 from previous case).
- Conducting infection prevention and control (IPC) measures and also creating line list of high and low contacts including health workers for follow up.
- Specimen collection kits deployed to affected counties and samples are safely transported by Riders for Health to the National Reference laboratory.
- Intensified active case search using outbreak case definition continues in all health facilities and communities in affected counties.
- Drugs and medical supplies deployed to counties and replenished rapidly as needed.
- Health workers are being sensitized and mentored on Lassa fever prevention including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment during treatment of viral hemorrhagic fever cases. Clinical staff were trained on case management and additional IPC measures.
- Safe and dignified burial team members have been trained in preparedness for the burial of highly suspicious unexplained deaths. Ring approach assessment continued and led by IPC focal persons based on priority of sites.
- Community engagement activity is ongoing in the affected communities with rapid response teams visiting the affected households and families and providing information on environmental cleanliness.
- Plans are underway to support affected communities to mount clean-up campaigns.

Situation interpretation
------------------------
Liberia is one of the West African countries where Lassa fever is endemic along with Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Nigeria. A total of 13 cases have been confirmed in the recent outbreak, with 9 deaths recorded. However, the current case fatality ratio (69%) is greater than that recorded in the past 5 years. Response activities, with the support of the NPHRL, the minister of health and partners, continue in the affected counties albeit with challenges in all pillars of the response.

Proposed actions
----------------
The Ministry of Health and its partners should develop and implement strategies to strengthen all pillars of the response to the Lassa fever outbreak, including surveillance, communication, and case management. Given that Lassa fever is usually transmitted to humans by rodents, good "community hygiene" should be promoted by conducting community engagements on the prevention of Lassa fever, rodent control measures and hygiene promotion as well as environmental scanning.

[As the report above indicates, Lassa fever virus is endemic in Liberia and cases there occur frequently. More explanation is offered for the unusually high 69% case fatality rate. That rate in Nigeria, for example, fluctuates around 20%. Are non-fatal cases underreported, is treatment inadequate, are infected individuals late in the course of their disease when hospitalized or is the Liberia Lassa fever virus more virulent? Answers to these question merit further investigation.

The Ministry of Health is wise to increase public information and advise citizens about measures that should be taken to avoid infection with the virus. Between 1 Jan and 27 Jun 2018, 20 cases were laboratory confirmed (see archive no. 20180711.5898495). Apparently, all those Lassa fever virus infections were acquired by contact with infected rodents or their excretions. Lassa fever virus can be acquired from infected rodents or patients in the hospital. Although no nosocomial infections are mentioned in the above report, transmission can occur in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed or barrier-nursing practices or biocontainment facilities in the laboratory are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients.

As mentioned in previous posts, Lassa fever virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (_Mastomys natalensis_ and _M. erythroleucus_) and the African wood mouse (_Hylomycus pamfi_) or their excreta, as was likely the situation in many of these cases. Rodent control has to be undertaken at the village level with individual households employing the preventive measures listed above. This requires an extensive and continuous public education effort.

Images of the _M. natalensis_ mouse can be seen at https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/45326-Mastomys-natalensis and of _M. erythroleucus_ and _H. pamfi_ at http://punchng.com/nigerias-large-rat-population-threatens-lassa-fever-war/. - Mod.TY
