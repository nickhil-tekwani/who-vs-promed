Vaccinations called for after rise in confirmed British measles cases
---------------------------------------------------------
The first six months of 2012 have seen almost twice as many confirmed cases of measles in England and Wales compared to the same period in 2011, according to figures published on Friday. There have been 964 cases confirmed this year, while 2011 only saw 497 confirmed cases for the first half of the year. In 2011 1086 cases were reported compared to a total of 380 reported cases in 2010, the Health Protection Agency reports.

Additionally, reported cases of rubella in the first six months of this year exceeded annual totals for the previous nine years. The rise is associated with travel to other European countries. Measles cases have also been associated with travel, as ongoing outbreaks have been seen in Merseyside and Sussex and various traveling communities across England.

The uptake of doses of the MMR vaccination in England is 93 percent for the first dose and 87 percent for the second dose. The uptake of MMR vaccine in Wales is 95 percent for the first dose and 88 percent for the second dose. There has been a dramatic rise in coverage since 2002 when coverage for the first dose was below 80 percent. It is suspected that some older children may not have been protected and may now be contributing to the increasing numbers of reported cases.

"It's extremely concerning that measles cases are continuing to rise. Measles can be very serious and parents should understand the risks associated with the infection, which in severe cases can result in death," Dr. Mary Ramsay, the head of immunization at the HPA [Health Protection Authority], said. "Although uptake of the MMR has improved in recent years some children do not get vaccinated on time and some older children, who missed out when uptake was lower, have not had a chance to catch-up. Therefore, there are still enough people who are not protected to allow some large outbreaks to occur among unvaccinated individuals.

Measles -- Horn of Africa, 2010-2011
---------------------------------
Member states of the World Health Organization (WHO) African (AFR) and Eastern Mediterranean (EMR) regions have set goals for measles elimination by 2020 and 2015, respectively. The two WHO regions include AFR member states Ethiopia and Kenya, and EMR member state Somalia. All three countries are in the Horn of Africa, where measles remains endemic, with periodic outbreaks despite efforts to achieve elimination goals (1). This report describes outbreaks that occurred in the Horn of Africa during 2010-2011. The outbreaks were exacerbated by a complex humanitarian emergency in Somalia, with an influx of an estimated 600 000 refugees into camps in Kenya and Ethiopia near the borders with Somalia. During 2010-2011, a total of 9756 measles cases were reported in Ethiopia and 2566 in Kenya, with wide age distributions, and 16 135 were reported in Somalia, with 78% occurring among children aged <5 years. Cases occurred predominantly in unvaccinated persons. Outbreak response immunization (ORI) strategies were implemented; however, outbreaks continued. To reach AFR and EMR measles elimination targets, uniform high coverage with 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) must be achieved and maintained in Horn of Africa countries, including in refugee camps.

In 2010, the World Health Assembly endorsed targets to be met by 2015 as milestones toward eventual global measles eradication. These included 1) increasing first dose coverage with MCV (MCV1) to ≥90% nationally and ≥80% in every district, 2) reducing to and maintaining an annual measles incidence of <5 cases per million population, and 3) reducing estimated measles mortality by ≥95% in comparison with 2000 estimates (2). WHO recommends 2 MCV doses for all children and emphasizes on-time delivery of the first dose at age 9 months in countries with ongoing measles virus transmission (3). In Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia, MCV1 is provided in the routine childhood vaccination schedule at age 9 months, and a second dose of MCV is provided through periodic supplemental immunization activities (SIAs). In Somalia, MCV also is provided to children aged 9-59 months during child health days or SIAs. In refugee settings, Sphere standards for humanitarian response* recommend providing MCV to ≥95% of new arrivals aged 6 months-15 years and SIAs to prevent outbreaks (4). Infants that receive MCV1 at age <9 months should receive 2 additional doses at least 1 month apart and according to the national immunization schedule (3).

WHO and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) annually estimate MCV1 coverage administered through routine immunization services among children aged 1 year. Countries annually report the number of districts with ≥80% MCV1 coverage (5). In refugee camps, MCV coverage is monitored by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees using administrative records and nutrition surveys (6). Countries report annual measles surveillance data to WHO and UNICEF (7). In Kenya and Ethiopia, measles surveillance is case-based with laboratory confirmation of suspected measles (8). In Somalia, case-based surveillance with laboratory testing is limited to sentinel sites; an integrated disease surveillance system collects aggregated case counts of clinically confirmed measles cases nationally.

Ethiopia
-------
Estimated MCV1 coverage in Ethiopia was 56% in 2010 and 57% in 2011; the percentage of districts reporting ≥80% MCV1 coverage was 45% in 2010 and 43% in 2011. A nationwide measles SIA targeting approximately 9.1 million children aged 9-47 months was conducted in two phases; seven regions were targeted in October 2010 and the four remaining regions in February 2011 (Figure 1). Administrative coverage† was 106%, and coverage based on a population-based survey was 88.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 85.1%-90.6%); 87 (91%) districts reported >95% administrative coverage. During 2010-2011, annual reported measles incidence decreased from 75 to 42 per 1 million population; the percentage of reported cases among children aged <5 years decreased from 45% to 31% [Data tabulated in the original text].

Kenya
-----
Estimated MCV1 coverage in Kenya was 86% in 2010 and 87% in 2011. The percentage of districts reporting ≥80% MCV1 coverage was 66% in 2010 and 65% in 2011. The most recent nationwide measles SIA in 2009 reached approximately 82% of an estimated 5.5 million children aged 9-59 months. During 2010, 105 measles cases were reported, primarily in the northeast during the first half of the year. Starting in January 2011, measles cases increased throughout the country, first occurring in the Northeast Province and among the Somali community in Nairobi. National reported measles incidence increased from 3 per 1 million population in 2010 to 59 per 1 million population in 2011. During July-August 2011, ORIs were conducted in five districts in the Northeast Province; however, cases coinciding with outbreaks in Dadaab refugee camps and in southern Somalia continued to occur.

Somalia
-------
Estimated MCV1 coverage in Somalia was 46% in both 2010 and 2011. The percentage of districts reporting ≥80% MCV1 coverage was 20% in 2010 and 35% in 2011. During three rounds of child health days conducted during May 2010-January 2011, southern and central regions were inaccessible because of armed conflict, and national administrative coverage was 39%-62%. During 2010-2011, reported measles incidence increased from 145 to 1,542 cases per 1 million population [Data tabulated in the original text]. ORIs were implemented, but cases continued to occur in 2011.

Refugee Camps
-------------
In 1991, the Hagadera, Ifo, and Dagahaley camps were established in the Dadaab refugee complex in northeastern Kenya to house Somali refugees fleeing civil war. During 2005-2011, the estimated refugee population increased from 127 387 to 443 974 in Dadaab. To accommodate approximately 75 000 refugees in unplanned settlements, Ifo-extension and Kambioos camps were added in August 2011. In the Dollo Ado region of southern Ethiopia, Bokolmanyo and Malkadida refugee camps were established in response to refugees arriving from Somalia during 2009-2010. In 2011, the estimated population of the Dollo Ado camps increased from 46 000 to 142 233, and Kobe, Hilaweyn, and Bur-Amino camps were opened to accommodate the influx of refugees.

In the Dadaab refugee camps, sporadic measles cases occurred during January-June 2011. In July 2011, an outbreak began, coinciding with a large influx of refugees and the measles outbreak in Somalia; 59% of cases were among refugees aged ≥15 years. During 2011, ORIs were conducted during March 28-April 7, targeting children aged 9 months-14 years; during August 1-5, targeting children aged 6 months-5 years; and during September 12-17, targeting adults aged 15-29 years. In addition, in August 2011, measles vaccination was provided to new arrivals aged 6 months-29 years, all hospitalized pediatric patients, and unvaccinated household contacts aged 6 months-14 years. Beginning in October, reported cases decreased as the numbers of newly arriving refugees also decreased. During March-April 2011, a cluster of measles cases occurred in the Dollo Ado refugee camps, followed by an outbreak involving 436 cases during July-October; 44% of cases were among refugees aged ≥15 years. In September 2011, routine measles vaccination was expanded to include new arrivals aged 6 months-29 years. Beginning in September, the number of new arrivals and reported cases decreased.

MMWR Editorial Note
-----------------
Severe drought, famine, war, large-scale population movements, and overcrowded refugee camps led to a complex emergency in the Horn of Africa during 2010-2011. In Somalia, low MCV coverage in areas where immunization services could not be provided for nearly 2 years led to a massive measles outbreak, primarily among children aged <5 years. Population movements, including large influxes of refugees from southern and central areas of Somalia into camps in Kenya and Ethiopia near the Somalia borders led to measles virus transmission among refugees and to outbreaks in Ethiopia and Kenya. After ORIs, the number of cases decreased in the refugee camps; the decrease coincided with a decrease in the number of arriving refugees. However, large outbreaks continued in Kenya and Somalia.

In Somalia, a decades-long civil war and the absence of a centralized government crippled efforts to provide basic public health services, including delivering vaccinations to children. Strategies to achieve high vaccination coverage in such settings should use "days of tranquility" to implement vaccination and child health days (9), and should be designed to ensure that every child receives 2 MCV doses, in accordance with WHO recommendations (3). In 2012, the measles outbreak has continued, and additional vaccination activites should be implemented.

In Kenya, 41% of cases nationally occurred among children aged <5 years, indicating that substantial numbers of children were missed by ORIs and SIAs during the past 4 years. In 2011, an ORI was implemented 6 months after the start of the outbreak, targeting a narrow age group in a limited geographic area, but cases continued to occur. A nationwide follow-up measles SIA is planned for 2012, and efforts are needed to ensure a high-quality campaign.

In Ethiopia, although estimated MCV1 coverage nationally was ≤50% before 2009, measles incidence decreased from 2010 to 2011, which might be related to achieving high coverage in the nationwide SIA targeting children aged 9-47 months during 2010-2011. A comprehensive review of surveillance data and SIA implementation conducted in March 2010 led to the development of SIA "best practices," which were implemented during the 2010-2011 SIA, including involving local leaders in microplanning and social mobilization, focusing on hard-to-reach areas, improving training, and house-to-house canvassing during the SIA.

To prevent large measles outbreaks and ultimately reach measles elimination goals in EMR by 2015 and in AFR by 2020, vaccination strategies must be implemented to achieve and maintain uniformly high 2-dose MCV coverage to reach the 93%-95% population immunity threshold that can provide herd immunity in all countries. In refugee settings, Sphere minimum standards for humanitarian response should highlight the need to provide 1) 2 MCV doses to every child, 2) close monitoring of 2-dose MCV coverage, and 3) inclusion of informal settlements and host communities in vaccination plans. Outbreak preparedness should be maintained to ensure high-quality surveillance for measles cases, appropriate case management, and rapid ORI strategies that reach susceptible populations, based on the age distribution of infected persons in a particular outbreak (10).

Notes and Summary
-----------------
The member states of the World Health Organization's African Region (AFR) and Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) have set goals for measles elimination by 2020 and 2015, respectively. After implementation of measles vaccination strategies, estimated coverage with the first dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) in 2010 was 76% in AFR and 85% in EMR. However, reported measles cases in AFR increased from 37,012 to 199,174 during 2008-2010. Reported measles cases in EMR increased from 12,120 to 36,605 during 2008-2009 but declined to 10,072 in 2010. During 2010, reported measles incidence per 1 million population was 238 in AFR and 17 in EMR.

Estimated MCV1 coverage for Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia in the Horn of Africa was 56%, 86%, and 46% in 2010, and 57%, 87%, and 46% in 2011, respectively. Measles outbreaks occurred in the region and were exacerbated by a complex humanitarian emergency in Somalia. During 2010-2011, annual reported measles incidence in Somalia increased from 145 to 1,542 cases per 1 million, and an influx of refugees from Somalia into border camps in Kenya and Ethiopia resulted in outbreaks in the camps. Outbreak response immunization campaigns were implemented but with limited effect.

To reach AFR and EMR measles elimination targets, uniform high coverage with 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) must be achieved and maintained in Horn of Africa countries, including in refugee camps where Sphere standards for humanitarian response should be fully implemented. To reach global measles reduction targets, strengthened vaccination strategies including supplemental immunization activity "best practices," uniform 2-dose MCV coverage, and improved outbreak preparedness and response among displaced populations are necessary to achieve immunity to measles in 93%-95% of the population.

Fears over measles outbreak
------------------------
Health experts in Kimilili [Bungoma district] have raised an alarm over a measles outbreak. This follows the death of three children from the disease in Kambini. Twenty people are feared to have contracted the disease. Kimilili district medical officer Mutoro Wambasi yesterday told the Star that the patient's blood samples have been sent to KEMRI [Kenya Medical Research Institute]in Nairobi for further tests and analysis.

He said they are working with experts from the World Health Organisation, who have come in handy in providing technical advice on the reported cases. "I call upon other NGOs to show up and assist in the efforts to curb this outbreak to avert more deaths," he said. Wambasi attributed the outbreak to ignorance as parents do not take their children for immunisation. He however requested the residents to take children with measles symptoms to the nearest health facility to prevent the spread of the disease. "We are liaising with the Ministry of Public Health to carry out emergency vaccination to contain the disease," he said.

Fatal outbreak: Measles kills 2 infants in North Waziristan
------------------------------------------------
MIRANSHAH: Measles claimed the lives of two more infants in North Waziristan on Tuesday [28 Aug 2012] , increasing the number of people killed by the disease to 18 since April. An 18-month-old girl and one-year-old boy died of measles pneumonitis in Darpa Khel area of tehsil Miranshah, said Agency Headquarters Hospital Miranshah MS Dr Muhammad Sadiq, adding that 25 more people are admitted at the hospital.

The outbreak of measles started in April across the Agency. Sadiq said that in the past week many patients have come from Darpa Khel and Madakhel because the localities have major sanitation problems. "We started vaccinating children but the disease resurfaced after a gap of one month," he said, adding that most of the vaccines provided by the government have expired because of high temperatures and prolonged power outages.

"Most of the children in Darpa Khel are suffering from the disease," said Dr Muhammad Ali, a paediatrician at the hospital, adding that three of the 25 patients admitted have measles pneumonitis. "We discharged 70 patients on Tuesday after giving them medication," he added. He said that treatment cannot be provided for measles pneumonitis because the patient's body stops responding to medicines and people die within three days. The pediatrician said that most of the patients at the hospital were shifted from Khost, Afghanistan. "The Pakistani government could not vaccinate children from Afghanistan and when the epidemic broke [out] there, patients came to Pakistan for treatment, infecting children here."

Ali added that more vaccines are needed. "If we are not given enough vaccines we will not be able to control the situation," he said, adding that they have asked authorities in Peshawar to assist them. He said that deaths have been reported in Shawal, Datta Khel Birmal and Miranshah.

Health Officials Investigating Possible Measles Cases in NW Arkansas
----------------------------------------------------------
GENTRY: The Arkansas Department of Health [ADH] says it is investigating several suspected cases of measles in Gentry, Arkansas in Benton County. The Department says cases have not yet been confirmed, but officials are recommending protective action for those who might have been exposed. Gary Wheeler, MD, branch chief of the Infectious Disease Branch at ADH, says that measles is a very infectious disease with serious risks, especially for certain groups of people. "We are taking precautions as if this were measles until we have confirmation."

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, measles -- also known as rubeola -- is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by a virus. Families, college students, military recruits and others living in close quarters who are not vaccinated or immune from past infection are at very high risk of contracting the disease. Others who have less contact are still at risk if exposed to coughing or respiratory secretions. Measles causes fever, runny nose, cough, conjunctivitis (pink eye) and a rash all over the body. About one out of 10 children with measles also gets an ear infection, and one out of 20 develops pneumonia. For every 1000 children who get measles, one or two will die. Measles can potentially cause a pregnant woman to miscarry or give birth prematurely. Those whose immune systems are compromised by chronic disease, chemo-therapy or other causes are also at risk for serious illness. The Arkansas Department of Health urges that any Arkansan or visitor to the state that has not been vaccinated for measles receive vaccine from a doctor or at any local health unit statewide.

Before the introduction of the measles vaccine in 1963, nearly all children got measles by the time they were 15 years of age. Each year in the United States, about 450-500 people died because of measles, 48 000 were hospitalized, 7000 had seizures, and about 1000 suffered permanent brain damage or deafness. Currently, measles is rarely seen in the United States but is fairly widespread in many foreign countries. Today, there are roughly 50 cases a year reported in the United States, and most of these originate outside the country. In Arkansas, the ADH reported two cases in 2008 and one case in 2012.

Measles Cases Confirmed
---------------------
The Arkansas Department of Health [ADH] has confirmed that there are laboratory results from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirming that at least two of the original three suspected cases of measles in Gentry are positive. According to Gary Wheeler, MD, Branch Director of the Infectious Disease Branch at ADH, these results were expected, based on the first medical examinations.

"The message is very clear-immunizations are important for protection of the individual. They are also important protection for the community," Wheeler said.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), measles (also known as rubeola) is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by a virus. Families, college students, military recruits and others living in close quarters who are not vaccinated or immune from past infection are at very high risk of contracting the disease.

Measles outbreak concerns disease experts
------------------------------------
The Royal College of Pathologists of Australia (RCPA) has also called on doctors to be aware of the outbreaks and the need to test for measles, with 71 cases diagnosed in New South Wales (NSW) since the start of the year. RCPA spokeswoman Professor Lyn Gilbert said Australia had almost eliminated measles but in the past few years immunisation rates had fallen in some communities, including Pacific Islanders in Sydney, which had experienced measles outbreaks. "We also see measles in patients who have migrated to Australia after the recommended age of immunisation," Prof Gilbert said in a statement.

While NSW has recorded the highest number of cases this year, 11 people have also fallen victim to the disease in Victoria and four in Queensland. There have been 89 cases Australia-wide.

Prof Gilbert, the director of the Centre for Infectious Diseases and Microbiology, said more work was needed to increase the uptake of vaccinations and ensure hard-to-reach communities had access to the right information. "Many of those in underprivileged and migrant communities are still unaware that immunisations are available to them," Prof Gilbert said.

Measles is one of the most infectious of all communicable diseases, and is spread by coughing and sneezing. Symptoms include fever, lethargy, runny nose, moist cough and sore eyes followed by a blotchy red rash. Complications range from ear infections and diarrhoea to pneumonia or swelling of the brain.
It can be a severe illness even in otherwise healthy adolescents and young adults.
