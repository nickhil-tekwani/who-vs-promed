Clients who used a piercing and tattoo studio in Newport have been offered precautionary health checks. Concerns were raised after 5 people with serious skin infections were identified as having had a piercing carried out at the premises. The individuals were all treated as hospital in-patients.

The business has traded under the names of Blue Voodoo, Sun Tattoo Studio and Flesh Wound: Blue Voodoo at 92 Commercial Street, Newport between May 2013 and February 2014; [and] Blue Voodoo, Sun Tattoo Studio and Flesh Wound at 83 Commercial Street Newport between February 2014 and January 2015.

The confirmed cases of skin infection could also indicate a low risk of transmission of Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C and an extremely low risk of HIV transmission for all clients of these premises. A simple blood test to check for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV has been offered to clients that were pierced or had a tattoo at either premise. Therefore letters have been sent to around 550 clients identified from records offering a precautionary blood test. Clients that do not receive a letter by midday Friday 8 May 2015 but have had a piercing or tattoo at either premise are also invited to come forward for advice and if necessary testing. The helpline number for those who have not received a letter by midday Friday 8 May 2015 is 02920 402528.

The risk of picking up any blood-borne infections [e.g., hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV] through piercing or tattooing is very small, and there is no evidence that any such transmission has occurred in this instance, but tests are being offered as a precautionary measure.

There can be contamination of needles and equipment through body fluids if good hygiene practices are not followed. These can then come into contact with the next person's body fluids, so spreading infection.

The registered business has been the subject of ongoing investigations undertaken by Newport City Council's Environmental Health Team and has currently ceased trading. A series of dedicated clinics with specialist nurses have been set up in the Aneurin Bevan University Health Board area.

All 3 infections are uncommon in Wales. In the unlikely event that an individual had become infected it is worth knowing because effective treatment is available for all three viruses. This is a joint exercise being undertaken by Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, Public Health Wales and Newport City Council.

[The news report above fails to tell us what organisms caused the skin infections, which were serious enough to require hospitalization, and if any of these skin infections have linkages other than having body piercing or tattooing at the same facility. ProMED-mail would appreciate more detailed information concerning these infections from knowledgeable sources.

Infection associated with tattooing and body piercing could be caused by contamination in the tattooing parlor of instruments or inks or other injected materials, such as diluents (e.g., tap water). ProMED-mail has previously reported outbreaks of bacterial infection associated with tattooing and body piercing caused by _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, and various mycobacteria (See alsos below). In one post-tattoo outbreak, the premixed ink in sealed containers was contaminated with _Mycobacterium chelonae_, which suggested that tattoo ink production facilities were at fault (see ProMED-mail post Non-tuberculous mycobacteria - USA (02): (NY) tattoo, M. chelonae 20120824.1260129.)

Infection with blood-borne viral pathogens, such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV, have been associated with repeated use of injected material or repeated use of non-sterilized syringes or needles, which had been contaminated with blood of a viremic person, on other persons.

Newport, a city in southeast Wales, approximately 12 miles (19 km) northeast of Cardiff, is the 3rd largest city in Wales, with an urban population of 306 844. Newport is part of the Cardiff-Newport metropolitan area with a population of 1 097 000 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport,_Wales).
