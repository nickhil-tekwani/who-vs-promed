In 1996, travelers to Austria were alerted to TBE by signs placed in
airports, other public places, and pharmacies asking, "Have you been
vaccinated against encephalitis"?
Immuno AG--Vienna, Austria--makes a purified, formalin-inactivated virus
vaccine. "This vaccine has been administered as a licensed product in
Europe to over 3 million people, but is not yet licensed by FDA for use in
the U.S. The vaccine must be administered under a contingency use protocol
as an Investigational New Drug (IND). The vaccine produces antibodies in up
to 93% of individuals receiving the first 2 doses of the 3 dose series, and
in virtually all persons following the third dose. The vaccine is 80 to 90%
effective in preventing disease."

The TBE Vaccine: Past, present, and future...
---------------------------------------------
In 1939, the first formalin-inactivated vaccines were developed from mouse
brain tissue, and by 1960 cell culture-derived vaccines were created
(Smorodintsev et al, 1969).
- In 1976, a partially purified formalin-inactivated vaccine (Austrian virus
grown in chick embryo cells) became commercially available in Europe. This
vaccine gave satisfactory conversion rates but caused a significant rate of
adverse effects (Fields, 1995)
- The common side effects included headache, malaise, and fever.
- Vaccine purification, by continuous flow zonal ultracentrifugation (Heinz
et al, 1981), reduced the frequency of side effects. However, fever, local
redness, swelling and pain still occur in less than 10%.
- The purified injectable vaccine is licensed in Europe (FSME-Immun, Immuno
AG, Vienna). It contains Al(OH3) [aluminum hydroxide as an adjuvant and has
an efficacy of about 97-98% (Stevenson et al, 1991).
- In Canada, vaccine can only be accessed by asking your physician, who must
make a request to the HPB. Vaccine is supplied to the HPB by Immuno Canada.
-Research into alternative, more effective TBEV vaccines, is ongoing. For
example, live vaccines that yield lifelong immunity, made from non-virulent
strains are being investigated (Gresikova et al, 1986; Smorodintsev et al,
1969); NS1-based vaccines, that do not use virion surface proteins to avoid
the possibility of inducing antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of
infection (Jacobs et al, 1994; Jacobs, 1993); and the addition of HGH to the
aluminum hydroxide matrix, which may help to stimulate the initial clonal
expansion of virus-specific T cells thereby enhancing the immune response
against the virus (Stevenson et al, 1991).
Vaccine Dosing Schedule:
------------------------------------
- Three doses of the inactivated vaccine are required.
- The 2nd dose given 1-3 mos. after the 1st dose, and the 3rd dose is given
after 9-12 mos.
- After vaccination with 1,2, and 3 doses, seroconversion rate was found to
be greater than 70%, 95%, and greater than 99%, as measured within a month
after vaccination. Within twelve months 40%, 53%, and 79% were still
seropositive (Gustafson et al,
1992).
- The vaccine provides adequate protection for approximately three years.
Who should be Vaccinated?
-------------------------------------
- Persons living in endemic areas.
- Persons working under high-risk conditions (foresters, farmers, butchers,
military personnel, laboratory workers).
- Travelers engaged in high-risk activities (field work, camping, hiking).
- Livestock, milk-producing animals (cows & goats).
