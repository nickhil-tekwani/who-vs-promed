New species of _Babesia_ behind first cases of babesiosis in Austria and Italy
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The phylogenetic analysis indicates that [the new isolate] EU1 is most
closely related to but distinct from _Babesia odocoilei_, which infects
white-tailed deer.
In Europe, most reported human cases of babesiosis have been attributed,
without strong molecular evidence, to infection with the bovine parasite
_Babesia divergens_. We investigated the first known human cases of
babesiosis in Italy and Austria, which occurred in 2 asplenic men.
The complete 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) gene was amplified from specimens
of their whole blood by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). With phylogenetic
analysis, we compared the DNA sequences of the PCR products with those for
other _Babesia_ spp. The DNA sequences were identical for the organism from
the 2 patients. In phylogenetic analysis, the organism clusters with _B.
odocoilei_, a parasite of white-tailed deer; these 2 organisms form a
sister group with _B. divergens_. This evidence indicates that the patients
were not infected with _B. divergens_ but with an organism with previously
unreported molecular characteristics for the 18S rRNA gene.
Most of the cases reported in the US have been caused by infection with
_Babesia microti_, a parasite of small mammals transmitted by _Ixodes
scapularis_ ticks. Most European cases have been attributed to _B.
divergens_, a parasite of cattle transmitted by _I. ricinus_. From 1991
through 2000, however, additional zoonotic babesia and babesia-like
pathogens have been identified and characterized with molecular techniques.
These pathogens include, in the US, the WA1- (for "Washington 1") and CA1-
(for "California 1") type parasites and the MO1 (for "Missouri 1") parasite
and, in Europe, the organism we describe here.
We report what to our knowledge are the first described human cases of
babesiosis in Italy and Austria and provide evidence that the etiologic
agent of the 2 cases -- which is related to but clearly not _B. divergens_
-- has molecular characteristics that have not previously been reported.
Following the precedent we previously established for reports of newly
characterized organisms in the US, we refer here to this organism from
Europe as EU1 (for "European Union 1").
Case reports: The Italian and Austrian patients were 55 and 56 year old
men, respectively, who had undergone splenectomy in the 1980s because of
stage IA Hodgkin's disease. The Italian patient had recently begun
chemotherapy for stage IIIA diffuse large B cell lymphoma, which had been
diagnosed in June 1998. Both men lived in small towns and hunted
avocationally [for sport? - Mod.SH]; neither had pets. Only the Austrian
patient recalled tick exposure, a tick bite while hunting about 2 weeks
before he noticed his urine was dark.
Neither patient had travelled extensively: the Italian patient had never
left Italy, and the Austrian patient had been in Barbados (1998) and Turkey
(1999).The 2 cases ranged in severity from quite mild (Austrian case) to
moderately severe (Italian case). The salient clinical details of their
cases and the relevant laboratory values are provided in a table [in the
paper]. Fever occurred only in the Italian patient (maximum of 39 deg C),
which initially was considered a reaction to one of his chemotherapeutic
agents (bleomycin). He also had marked anemia, for which he received blood
transfusions. Both patients had thrombocytopenia, elevated serum lactate
dehydrogenase and bilirubin values, and dark urine from hemoglobinuria. The
Italian patient's creatinine value also was elevated.
In both cases, babesiosis was diagnosed by noting parasitic inclusions in
erythrocytes on peripheral blood smear. The intervals between onset of the
symptoms that ultimately were attributed to babesiosis and confirmation of
the diagnosis ranged from 2 days (Austrian case) to 10 days (Italian case).
Subsequent testing of serum specimens from both patients showed IFA
reactivity to _B. divergens_ but not to _B. microti_ antigens; serum from
the Italian patient was also tested for reactivity to WA1 antigens and was
negative. Attempts to obtain an isolate of the parasite that infected the
Austrian patient, by injecting specimens of his blood into jirds [rodent,
related to gerbils. - Mod.SH], were unsuccessful; the smears of blood from
periodic tail snips and PCR analysis of blood obtained by cardiac puncture
of the jirds were negative. Both patients responded to antimicrobial
therapy for babesiosis: the Austrian patient was treated with clindamycin,
and the Italian patient was treated with both clindamycin and quinine.

[Babesiosis is known in France and Spain, although an uncommon infection in
humans. In the immunocompetent host it is usually a benign, self limiting
infection and would most probably not be recognised in most cases. Both
patients reported here were splenectomized due to lymphoma, and one was
receiving chemotherapy. The cases illustrate that infections rare in humans
may cause disease in the immunocompromised host. The diagnosis was made by
old-fashioned microscopy of a thick blood film, which is indicated in cases
of fever of unknown origin, even if the patient has not been to a
malaria-endemic area. - Mod.EP]
