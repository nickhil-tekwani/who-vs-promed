President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo has directed the Department of
Health (DOH) to look into the increasing incidence of typhoid cases
here in 10 barangays [village] in Calamba City, Laguna. In her speech
keynoting the start of nationwide celebrations of Women's Month at
the New Calamba City Hall this morning [3 Mar 2008], the President
told DOH Secretary Francisco Duque III to personally look after the
plight of those who were stricken with typhoid fever.

Calamba City health officer Arsenio Lagos said that as of today [3
Mar 2008], there were 1041 reported cases of typhoid infection in 10
barangays of this city. He said his office began noticing the steady
rise of typhoid cases since 19 Feb 2008 when the 1st case was
recorded. He added that initial investigation showed that the typhoid
bacteria were probably passed on through the water here.

More than 900 people have been stricken with typhoid in a city just
south of the Philippine capital Manila, a Red Cross official said on
Monday [3 Mar 2008]. The number could rise further as officials in
Calamba city in Laguna province continue to track down the source of
the disease, provincial Red Cross administrator Rutelly Cabutin told
AFP.

"As of 5:00 pm today (0900 GMT) [3 Mar 2008], we have confirmed 903
cases. This includes those still in the hospital and those
discharged," Cabutin said. "It is quite alarming because the disease
was not confined to one village, but is spread out in 18 villages.
There could still be other undiagnosed cases," she said. "If the
source can be immediately detected it can be stopped, but if it
remains unknown, the number could increase."

The outbreak started in February 2008 but the cases have quickly
piled up over the past 2 weeks, she said, adding that some 5000
residents in 18 villages have sought medical help from the local
government.

Health department officials in Manila were not immediately available
to comment, but Cabutin said the local district water authority was
testing samples. She said only the health department in Manila can
officially declare an outbreak, but local news reports have said
hospitals in the area were having a hard time coping and that medical
supplies were running out.
