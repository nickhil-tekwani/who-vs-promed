A horse that was admitted to Fairfield Equine Associates for surgery last
month (Dec 06) has been placed under quarantine after having been
identified as carrying the neuropathogenic form of equine herpesvirus, or
EHV-1. EHV-1 can cause fevers and neurologic signs ranging from fever and
loss of coordination to weakness in the hind limbs and even paralysis.
Six horses in Florida have been euthanized during the last month after
having contracted the same virus, which can be deadly to horses.
The horse at Fairfield Equine Associates has been improving in recent days
but went through quite an ordeal after being admitted to the equine
hospital a few weeks ago for a lameness examination. The unnamed male horse
has been in quarantine since 24 Dec 2006, but its doctors are confident he
is up for a full recovery. They are also confident that their facility is
safe for other equine patients once the voluntary quarantine on the horse
is cleared.
The horse arrived in Newtown from a small barn in Vermont on 13 Dec 2006,
had surgery on 19 Dec, and it was 5 days later -- on 24 Dec -- that his
fever started and was quickly identified at EHV-1.
EHV-1 can be highly contagious to horses and can spread through the air. It
can be passed through shared tack and barn equipment, even by human hands
and clothing, making "tight [biosecurity] essential to stop it from
spreading," a press release from the equine hospital said this week.
Nevertheless, the staff at Fairfield Equine Associates is confident the
single horse currently under quarantine does not pose an equine health hazard.
"It's funny, but of all the descriptions provided -- whether quarantine,
deadly, or anything like that -- this is not an emergency," Mark R. Baus,
DVM, a managing partner for Fairfield Equine Associates said Wednesday
afternoon. "What this is about understanding the nature of this virus.
"Two things have made this particular virus significant," he continued.
"It's had a profound impact on the horse show circuit in Florida. The
winter equestrian festival has been significantly hampered ... the
implications on the winter season have been significant."
Seven stables in Wellington, Fla., were under quarantine for the highly
contagious virus in December 2006, and 6 horses had been euthanized in that
state as of 29 Dec due to EHV-1. State officials had also quarantined
stables in Ocala, Indiantown, and Jupiter Farms, Fla.
By 3 Jan 2007, Florida racetrack and state officials were "cautiously
optimistic" that the current outbreak is over, with no new cases of equine
herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) detected, according to a story posted at TheHorse.com.
Veterinarians have not been able to establish a link between the horse in
Newtown and any of those to those that sparked the Wellington outbreak.
The 2nd point of significance, said Dr Baus, is that advance testing
techniques allow veterinarians to isolate the virus more readily.
"We have never had to deal with it like this," he said. "We know that this
virus has been around, and we know that it has been in this area. We are
not convinced that this represents an epidemic in this area."
Dr Baus suspects the horse is dealing with a latent infection. "We don't
know definitely where he picked up this virus, but we feel it was within
him and emerged with the stress of this surgery," he said. "Our surgeon had
a suspicion, and we had a lot of awareness due to the infections in Florida."
Ryland B. Edwards III, DVM, PhD, Diplomate ACVS, has been in charge of the
Fairfield Equine case from the beginning.
"Dr Edwards actually had a suspicion about [the virus], simply because it
did not fit with other postoperative fevers," said Dr Baus. "The degree of
fever, the response to medication... nothing else was consistent with other
kinds of infections."
There are 2 tests to identify this virus, a blood test and a nasal swab.
The horse at Fairfield Equine Associates tested positive through the nasal
swab, but negative following the blood test. As soon as the horse's fever
and assimilated virus was identified, he was moved to a separate building.
Since placing the horse under voluntary quarantine, the hospital has not
admitted any horses as out- or in-patients. Staff members have instead been
seeing horses at surrounding stables, eliminating any exposure to the
infected horse at the hospital. Also, Fairfield Equine made arrangements
with a local hospital for surgical and emergency care that became necessary.
All of this was in the name of precaution, not mandatory measures.
"The important thing is, this is a voluntary quarantine," Dr Baus stressed.
"The federal vet was informed, but there is no action from them. The state
is also informed, but again, the quarantine is voluntary. We will determine
the optimum quarantine period based on the information we receive from
special disease specialists."
Working in the hospital's favor was the timing of the appearance of the
virus. The hospital was closed on Christmas Eve, so traffic was already
minimized.
The airborne virus is not harmful to humans. Precautions are taken to
protect horses from each other.
"The staff that deals with him does not deal with any other horse, so he's
had a dedicated staff," said Dr Baus. "They personally are not in any kind
of danger, and we have counseled them on how to approach or see any of
their personal horses.
"We feel that no other horse was put at significant risk," stressed Dr
Baus. A notice on the hospital's website reiterated that, saying in part,
"be assured that our doctors [who] are seeing horses at surrounding stables
have had no exposure to the infected horse in our hospital."
"We've taken a lot of extra steps up front, we've been very open with
information," Dr Baus said. "People should have no reservations about
coming back, about continuing to bring their horses here for care."
Founded in 1989, Fairfield Equine Associates is the largest privately owned
equine hospital on the East Coast. Its new facility opened in November 2000.
Fairfield Equine Associates will continue to post updates every 48 hours at
the hospital's website, FairfieldEquine.com. For additional information the
hospital may be reached by calling 270-3600.

[This article states that the horse arrived from Vermont. Any speculation
out there that the next cases will be in Vermont? No need to answer, we
shall all wait and see.
With this many cases in several states, it stands to reason that states may
be making this a reportable disease, thus giving them footing to slam shut
their borders and protect their industries. - Mod.TG]
