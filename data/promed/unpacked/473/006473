A woman in Kaohsiung City has contracted [a] hantavirus [infection], becoming the 5th case in the city and the 7th case in the country this year [2020], setting a new high since records began in 2001. The woman, in her 50s, is a restaurant worker in the southern port city. She was bitten by a rat on 19 Apr [2020] at her workplace and later exhibited symptoms of the disease, including fever, headache, muscle pain, chill, and excessive fatigue.

Unfortunately, screening did not take place until the end of May [2020] after her doctor reported it as a suspected case of the rare virus spread by rodents.

According to government data, there have been 2 new cases in the past 30 days -- one in May and one in June [2020] -- bringing the country's total to 7. There were 5 cases in Kaohsiung, one in New Taipei City, and one in Keelung City.

Of the 30 total confirmed hantavirus cases in Taiwan since 2001, 2 were imported; more than a third (13) were recorded in Kaohsiung; followed by 8 in New Taipei City.

Health authorities in Kaohsiung have placed traps to catch mice around the patient's neighborhood and workplace. Residents have been advised to sterilize areas likely contaminated by rodents with diluted bleach.

Hantaviruses are contracted through contact with urine, saliva, droppings, or bites of infected rodents, and the disease often begins as a flu-like illness. Symptoms appear within 1-5 weeks after exposure, according to CCOHS [Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety? - Mod.SH]. In the early stage, a patient may experience fever, chills, muscle aches, headaches, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, and gastrointestinal problems. It progresses rapidly and is deadly, with some experiencing abnormal drops in blood pressure or other cardiopulmonary disorders and conditions.

[Taiwan has had sporadic cases of hantavirus infections in recent years, with the Taiwan CDC indicating that there have been 0-4 cases per year recently.

Seven confirmed cases is a high number. The circumstances under which the individual above acquired her hantavirus infection is reported as a rat bite in the workplace. The species of rat is not stated nor does the report indicate which hantavirus is involved in this and in previous cases. However, the patient's mention that rats were observed in the workplace leads one to suspect Seoul hantavirus, assuming that the rats observed were brown rats (_Rattus norvegicus_), the natural host of this virus.

In Asia, the 5 recognized hantaviruses, with their main rodent reservoir species, are Hantaan virus (_Apodemus agrarius_), Amur virus (_A. peninsulae_), Thailand virus (_Bandicota indica_), Seoul virus (widely distributed worldwide in the brown rat, _Rattus norvegicus_), and Muju virus (_Myodes regulus_). Hantaan virus and Seoul virus cause cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) frequently in China.

The hantavirus most likely involved in the case above in Taiwan is Seoul virus harbored by _Rattus_ spp., as was the case in 2010 (see ProMED-mail 20100415.1221). People become infected when exposed to the virus in excreta (urine, saliva, and feces) of infected rats. It is not necessary to have contact with liquid urine; dust particles contaminated with dried urine may be inhaled. Transmission can also occur via rat bite.

An image of the brown rat, _R. norvegicus_, a reservoir of Seoul virus, can be seen at http://www.discoverlife.org/im/I_RB/0000/320/Rattus_norvegicus,I_RB27.jpg. - Mod.TY
