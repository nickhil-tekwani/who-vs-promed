Tuolumne County EHV-1 update
----------------------------
14 Sep 2011:
- 8 additional horses displaying compatible clinical signs [of equine
herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) infection] are in isolation at the facility and
are awaiting confirmatory test results from nasal swabs and blood
collected yesterday [13 Sep 2011]. The initial confirmed positive mare
has shown improvements and has been moved back to the quarantined
premises in Tuolumne County for recovery. Epidemiologic investigation
is ongoing and the premises owner and CDFA [California Department of
Food and Agriculture] have contacted owners of potentially exposed
horses that visited the affected premises over the past 2 weeks. On 13
Sep 2011, UCD [University of California, Davis] veterinary school
staff collected samples from 150 animals on the premises, including
the 8 demonstrating compatible clinical signs. Test results are
anticipated within the next few days. CDFA will continue to monitor
the situation.

- Potential exposure to EHV-1 [at the 10 Sep 2011 ACTHA [American
Competitive Trail Horse Association] ride for mustangs: a horse
participating in this ride was exposed to the positive confirmed case
on the Tuolumne County premises. The exposure occurred prior to the
ride and the exposed horse has not displayed any signs of disease.
However, out of an abundance of caution, CDFA has contacted all ride
participants to recommend isolation and temperature monitoring of
horses which participated in the ride for 14 days from the last
exposure. A temperature greater than 102 deg F [38.9 deg C] or other
compatible clinical signs should be reported to a veterinarian who can
collect samples for diagnostic testing.

13 Sep 2011:
- New EHV-1 case: on 12 Sep 2011, a mare from Tuolumne County has been
confirmed positive for the neuropathogenic strain of equine
herpesvirus-1. The mare is isolated, quarantined, and undergoing
treatment at a veterinary referral hospital. The premises of origin
have been quarantined and the potentially exposed animals on the
premises are being monitored. A full epidemiologic investigation at
the affected premises has been initiated by CDFA Animal Health Branch
field personnel. CDFA will continue to monitor the situation and
provide updates as the situation warrants.

Sonoma County September 2011 outbreak
-------------------------------------
13 Sep 2011:
- Quarantine release: on 23 Aug 2011, a 15-year-old Oldenburg mare
from Sonoma County was confirmed positive for the neuropathogenic
strain of equine herpesvirus-1. 2 additional horses on the affected
premises were confirmed positive by nasal swab for the neuropathogenic
strain of EHV-1. The only clinical sign displayed by these 2 horses
was a fever. Epidemiologic investigation conducted by CDFA reveals
minimal disease risk based on lack of animal movement on and off the
affected premises. The affected premises were quarantined and the 13
other horses on the property were temperature monitored twice daily
and observed for clinical signs for 21 days. No additional horses have
demonstrated a fever or any other compatible clinical signs. On 13 Sep
2011, the quarantine was released.
