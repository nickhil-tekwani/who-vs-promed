2004/008 First finding of Pepino mosaic potexvirus in Slovakia
--------------------------------------------------------------
Following a survey in 2003, the National Plant Protection Organisation
(NPPO) of Slovakia recently recorded the first finding of Pepino mosaic
potexvirus [PepMV] (EPPO Alert List) on tomatoes (_Lycopersicon
esculentum_). Commercial tomato production sites in fields, plants under
protected conditions as well as imported plants were inspected. 58
inspections of 19 487 tomato plants (grown on 47.5 ha) were made.
13 samples (corresponding to 26 plants) were collected and tested by DAS
ELISA in a diagnostic laboratory. Only 1 sample was found positive. The
sample came from a plastic house in a leisure garden at Liptovsky Mikulas.
All plants in this plastic house (grown on 7 square metres) were
immediately destroyed.
The situation of PepMV in Slovakia can be described as follows: 1st
reported in 2003, tomato plants grown in a small and non-commercial plastic
house at Liptovsky Mikulas, under eradication.

[Fortunately only 1 of 13 samples was infected. Given that PepMV is
extremely infectious, quick action on the part of quarantine officials
stopped what might have been an outbreak. Continued vigilance is required
to prevent spread of PepMV. - Mod.DH]
