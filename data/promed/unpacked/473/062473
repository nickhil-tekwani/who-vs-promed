So far this year [2015], the Tarija Health Services Department (SEDES) reported the 1st 6 suspected cases of hantavirus [infection] and a person who died of this disease, and confirmatory laboratory results from Santa Cruz are awaited.

The responsible official of SEDES Zoonoses, Claudia Montenegro, stated that since Tarija does not have a laboratory to process samples for these types of diseases, they had to send [the samples] to the national reference laboratory [in Santa Cruz]. She said that samples for the 1st test were sent a week ago, but so far, the results are not known. She said that the virus is found in Bermejo and Padcaya and also in Villa Montes. The patients are from the 2 1st mentioned municipalities.

She explained that due to the rainy season, there is more food for the rodents and greater reproduction, with resulting increasing risk of infection from the disease [virus], made still worse when people invade the habitat of these rodents.

Montenegro recommended not leaving food out in this weather; remove weeds, put screens in houses, and do not come close to the rodents or be in constant contact with them.

The disease is characterized by a fever of over 38.3 C [101 F] accompanied by respiratory difficulty in a previously healthy person, chills, headache, bone and muscle pain, which may be accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. The incubation period without symptoms may last up to 45 days.

[These cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) occurred in Tarija department and were confirmed in Oruro department. Previous cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome have been reported from tropical, lowland areas of Bolivia, including 7 cases in Tarija last year (2014). The specific hantaviruses involved in these or previous cases for the last 2 years (2013, 2014) in Bolivia are not given. In the lowland Amazon Basin of Bolivia, the possible hantavirus, its rodent hosts, and their images that might be involved in these hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) cases include:
- Laguna Negra virus (_Calomys laucha_ http://www.faunaparaguay.com/images/Calomys%20laucha%20enciso%2031aug2011.jpg and _C. callosus_ https://eee.uci.edu/clients/bjbecker/PlaguesandPeople/Calomyscallosusb.jpg);
- Bermejo (Chodo rice rat _Oligoryzomys chacoensis_ http://www.faunaparaguay.com/oligorizomyschacoensis.html);
- Oran (_O. longicaudatus_ http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/imgs/512x768/0000_0000/0711/1203.jpeg).

Since some of these cases occurred in the Bermejo municipality, perhaps Bermejo virus was responsible for at least some of these cases of HPS.
