BOTULISM, RISK FROM PACKAGED VEGETABLES: REQUEST FOR INFO

I am writing from Santa Fe, New Mexico. The local health markets in the
last week have stopped selling their various sprouts (e.g., broccoli
sprouts) in the normal plastic boxes with holes, and have started selling
them in air tight ziplock bags (for freshness). The suppliers in
California, I am told, have made the decision to change packaging. This
seems to be in keeping the national TV campaign by ziplock type plastic bag
manufacturers to convince consumers that salad ingredients at home should
be stored in airtight bags to promote freshness and allow consumers to keep
vegetables longer.
I am aware of the Chinese debacle a few years back when they packaged
mushrooms in airtight containers and discovered that the mushrooms
continued to respire for a time after packaging. An anaerobic environment
was created and botulism was the result. Is a similar problem being courted
by sprout producers/supermarkets and/or ziplock bag manufacturers? If the
mushroom model applies, a real problem may be brewing in the USA. Or, are
sprouts radically different than mushrooms?
