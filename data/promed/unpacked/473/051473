Maine state health officials are trying to determine the nature of a flu
strain that struck passengers on a Holland American cruise ship. Cruise
ship officials say 65 people, including 40 crew members and 25 passengers,
have been diagnosed with flu-like symptoms since the ship left Montreal
last Thursday. A spokesman says some of the passengers boarded with those
symptoms. The ship's departure was delayed last week for 18 hours as the
ship's doctors and Canadian authorities tested six passengers who were
hospitalized with severe flu-like symptoms. Doctors confirmed they were
suffering from influenza-A. Dr. Ron St. John of Health Canada, the federal
agency which tested the passengers in Montreal, said he believed the flu
was introduced by Australians among the 1,500 passengers.
[Ron St. John has indicated to ProMED-mail that "Influenza A [was
confirmed both from specimens taken in Canada and specimens taken on board
during cruise (done by CDC). This strain same as one circulating in
Australia and included in this year's flu vaccine." This is the same
outbreak referenced as atypical community acquired pneumonia above. Thanks
to Ron for this clarification. --Mod ES
