Ten people are being tested after coming in contact with a horse that died from Hendra virus in north Queensland. The 3-year-old gelding fell ill on a property southeast of Townsville on Tuesday [3 Jan 2012].

Queensland chief vet Rick Symons says its condition deteriorated quickly. "A veterinarian was called to a sick horse yesterday [5 Jan 2012]. The horse was apparently blind; it was staggering, and had a nasal discharge," he said. "The veterinarian suspected Hendra virus and took samples and sent them to the lab in Brisbane."

The tests confirmed on Wednesday [4 Jan 2012] night that it was Hendra, and experts from Biosecurity Queensland and Queensland Health went to the site.

The owner, the owner's partner, the vet, and the backhoe driver who buried the dead horse are among those who will be screened for the virus.

Five other horses, a dog, and a cat will also be tested, and the site has been quarantined.

"There'll be no movement of horses on or off the property or material that could transfer Hendra virus on and off the property," Dr Symons said. "And we're in the process of talking to neighbours to find out what horses are in the area."

The Hendra virus has a rapid effect and tends to kill animals over a short period of time. More than 20 horses died or were put down during Hendra outbreaks last year [2011] across Queensland and northern New South Wales.

Authorities say it is unusual for Hendra to surface during summer, with most cases occurring in the July-to-September period.

North Queensland Equestrian Group spokesman Trevor Hyatt says horses must be kept away from trees to stop the virus spreading. "We need to be aware that there are flying foxes that are contributing to this," he said. "We need to keep horses out from underneath the trees. We need to keep our water supply covered so we can help prevent it from spreading."

Scientists are preparing to trial a Hendra vaccine, but it is not expected to be on the market until next year [2013].

[This is a vicious disease for horses and people. When flying foxes are in the area, horses should be kept out from under trees, especially at times when the foxes feed on the fruit. Horse owners need to critically access the property to determine safe places for the horses.

It is sad that this disease still seems to march on. It may have started last calendar year, but it feels like one long single year of Hendra virus.
