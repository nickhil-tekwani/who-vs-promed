Producers may have lost 100 000 metric tons of [salmon] production, or about 13 percent of the 2015 harvest, [Felipe] Sandoval [head of producer association SalmonChile], was quoted as saying by Chilean newspaper Diario Financiero. Chile's salmon industry employs 73 000 people and is the main source of employment in some of the southern regions of the South American country.

Marine Harvest on [Mon 11 Apr 2016] announced up to 500 job cuts in its Chilean operations on red tide and a weaker economic scenario for Chilean salmon. The industry hasn't fully recovered from a devastating outbreak of infectious salmon anemia virus (ISA) almost a decade ago, and is still getting to grips with a new government framework for regulator the sector.

Red tide is a naturally occurring phenomenon in Chile and, like earthquakes, occurs once a decade and can be mitigated by having insurances in place, Multiexport Foods CEO Andres Lyon told Diario Financiero.

The uptick in prices as a result of the Chilean losses give some room for optimism for the sector after producers suffered in 2015 from weaker revenues from main markets such as Brazil and Russia because of weaker currencies in those nations, he said. Multiexport recorded a $32.9 million loss in 2015.

Chilean producers are also contending with higher usage of antibiotics to combat the effect of the salmonid rickettsial septicaemia (SRS) virus, which may be costing them up to $700 million annually, the newspaper said. Pharmaq, a unit of global animal health giant Zoetis, introduced a new drug last week in Chile to prevent SRS and eliminate the need for antibiotics.

[A "red tide" can often have a devastating effect on fisheries in some coastal areas. Red tides are caused by several species of microscopic plants called phytoplankton. These species produce strong chemical poisons called toxins. As the bloom increases the density of red tide organisms increase to several million cells in each liter of seawater. The result is a deadly mass of toxin-containing water leaving a wake of dead and dying fish. These toxins cause extensive fish kills, contaminate shellfish and create respiratory irritation for people who live along the shore.

Dinoflagellates produce a number of toxins. How the disease is designated or named tends to reflect the organism responsible. Red tide is caused by several toxic algae. Depending upon the toxin, it is also known as paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), because it causes shellfish for consumption to be toxic. Red tide or harmful algal blooms (HABs) are events in which single-celled protists, dinoflagellates, proliferate rapidly and accumulate in the water column. These events are associated with wildlife mortalities because, under certain circumstances, these organisms can produce potent toxins. Normally, these toxins enter the food web when they are consumed by filter feeding animals -- such as clams, oysters, mussels -- in which the toxins bioaccumulate.

The _Alexandrium_ genus is found in coastal waters high in nitrogen content. These organisms produce a neurotoxin, like many of the organisms capable of causing paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). The neurotoxin is considered fatal for humans consuming contaminated shellfish and may be dangerous to humans and animals that swim in waters that are "blooming" with the organisms.

Ocean spray containing the organisms may also cause illnesses, including rashes and eye irritation in people. Some species of this genus are capable of causing "red tide" that may be visible for long distances along a coastline. One interesting note is that both people and dogs can be sensitive to the spray effects associated with a red tide bloom. Dogs react in much the same fashion as people, with eye irritation, nose, and respiration irritation, and some dogs will have inflamed ears, and irritated skin.

PSP is a significant problem in several geographic areas, especially on both the east and west coasts of the United States. Produced by several closely related species in the genus _Alexandrium_, PSP toxins are responsible for persistent problems due to their accumulation in filter-feeding shellfish, but they also move through the food chain, affecting zooplankton, fish larvae, adult fish, and even birds and marine mammals. _Alexandrium_ blooms generally do not involve large-cell accumulations that discolor the water and may instead be invisible below the water surface. Low-density populations can cause severe problems due to the high potency of the toxins produced. Furthermore, _Alexandrium_ spp can grow in relatively pristine waters, and it is difficult to argue that anthropogenic nutrient inputs are stimulating the blooms. These characteristics are important when considering mitigation and control strategies.

Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) is a significant problem in many areas. Caused by several closely related species in the genus _Alexandrium_, PSP toxins are responsible for persistent problems due to their accumulation in filter feeding shellfish, but they also move through the food chain, affecting zooplankton, fish larvae, adult fish, and even birds and marine mammals.

It is likely that seasonally recurring outbreaks of PSP are linked to the existence of a dormant cyst stage in the _Alexandrium_ life history. This strategy allows the species to deposit dormant cells in sediments where they survive through harsh winter conditions and then germinate to initiate new outbreaks in subsequent years. Long-term climatic variability, which affects temperature, upwelling, and currents or allows cysts to survive in areas where they did not before, may be factors in extensions.

Often PSP is associated with red tides or algal blooms. Red tide is caused by an organism called _Karenia brevis_, which in high concentrations can make the water look red. The organism releases a toxin that paralyzes the respiratory system of fish and other marine life. _K. brevis_ is a marine dinoflagellate common in Gulf of Mexico waters and is the organism responsible for Florida red tides. The toxin it produces is called brevetoxin, which can cause neurotoxic poisoning.

Airborne toxins, water spray, and splashes in an outbreak have kept people from beaches while leaving others with irritated eyes and throats. Red tide irritates the skin of people exposed to it and can cause itchy eyes, scratchy throats, and coughs. Harvesting from affected areas for personal consumption is discouraged. Red tide poisoning symptoms include nausea and dizziness and may last for several days.

Shellfish that have caused this disease include mussels, cockles, clams, scallops, oysters, crabs, and lobsters. Symptoms begin anywhere from 15 minutes to 10 hours after eating the contaminated shellfish, although usually within 2 hours. Symptoms are generally mild, and begin with numbness or tingling of the face, arms, and legs. This is followed by headache, dizziness, nausea, and muscular incoordination. Patients sometimes describe a floating sensation. In cases of severe poisoning, muscle paralysis, and respiratory failure occur, and in these cases death may occur in 2 to 25 hours.

Previously, the organism causing red tide was known as _Gymnodinium breve_, but it has been reclassified in the taxonomy of dinoflagellates. Its new name -- _Karenia brevis_ -- was chosen in honor of Dr Karen Steidinger, a prominent red tide scientist from the Florida Marine Research Institute in St Petersburg, Florida. - Mod.TG
