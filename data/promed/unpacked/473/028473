19 Jun 2015 Liberia: Stop harboring sick people -- official cautions over Ebola
http://allafrica.com/stories/201506191204.html?viewall=1
[Liberia's Assistant Health Minister says Ebola could return to Liberia if Liberians keep harboring sick people from Guinea and Sierra Leone. Assistant Minister Nyenswah said: "This virus will enter Liberia if Liberians are not careful bringing sick people from Guinea and Sierra Leone. If the checkpoint did not have the thermometers or knew that bleeding is one of the symptoms [persons who have Ebola virus disease could enter."].... - more

19 Jun 2015 Sierra Leone: Ebola returned to the capital, Freetown, this week after being absent for 18 consecutive days, officials there said. A young man sick with the disease in another part of Sierra Leone ran away from a quarantine area and came to Freetown, Patrick Fatoma, a spokesman for the National Ebola Response Center, told The Associated Press... - more

18 Jun 2015 Sierra Leone: Children report increased exploitation, teenage pregnancies in Ebola-affected Sierra Leone
http://www.wvi.org/ebola-crisis/pressrelease/children-report-increased-exploitation-teenage-pregnancies-ebola-affected
[Plan International, Save the Children and World Vision International, with the support of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), recently consulted over 1100 girls and boys, aged 7 to 18 years, from 9 districts about the impact of Ebola.

The children saw the country's 9-month school closure as being directly linked to increases in child labor and exploitation, exposure to violence in the home and community, and teenage pregnancy.

It was believed by the majority of the girls interviewed that higher incidences of teenage pregnancy in their communities are as a result of girls being outside the protective classroom environment, exposing them to the risk of sexual exploitation or assault.

19 Jun 2015 USA (Alabama): Ebola scare at Children's Hospital of Alabama a false alarm
http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2015/06/ebola_scare_at_childrens_of_al.html
[Patient was brought to the hospital by private automobile, arriving at approximately 1200 hrs on 19 Jun 2015. He was immediately hospitalized, per hospital's protocol. By approximately 1220 hours the same day, doctors ruled out an Ebola virus infection, and the patient is undergoing further evaluation.]

[Suspected Ebola cases should never be taken to hospital by private -- or public -- transport. An ambulance should be called, and the crew advised in advance that the case is an Ebola suspect. - Mod.JW]

[The CDC's protocol for handling travelers from West Africa in the prior 21 days has been downgraded. The revised algorithm is a tool to assist healthcare providers identify and treat patients who have been in Liberia as opposed to Sierra Leone and Guinea. See ProMED-mail post "Ebola update (79): WHO update, Liberia guidelines, susp, research, vacc, funding 20150617.3445572" for further discussion. - Mod.LK]

Vaccines
--------
18 Jun 2015 Ghana: Ebola vaccine test has not started in Ghana
http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Ebola-vaccine-test-has-not-started-in-Ghana-Segbefia-363121
[Mr Alex Segbefia, Ghana's Minister of Health (MOH), stated in parliament on 17 Jun 2015 that the Ebola vaccine trial had not started anywhere; the government has not given approval for any vaccines to be imported, and volunteers had not been recruited for any of the proposed trials. The MOH informed members of parliament the vaccine did not contain Ebola virus and cannot cause Ebola virus disease. ...
The MOH said Ghana was selected as a candidate country for the clinical trials because Ghana shares borders with the 3 other potential clinical trial candidates.]

[There has been a lot of heated misinformed discussion surrounding the proposed Ebola vaccine trial in Ghana. In ProMED-mail post "Ebola update (79): WHO update, Liberia guidelines, susp, research, vacc, funding 20150617.3445572," there was a report from 16 Jun 2015 noting "prolonged bleeding in 10 to 15 per cent of the vaccinated population and fear that those vaccinated in both phases (i.e., I and II) may shed the adenovirus vector into the surrounding community. A reliable source has suggested that apparently the MOH in Ghana was upset by some individuals not having been informed of the upcoming trial. They are not aware of any bleeding side effects and felt that shedding a defective adenovirus is obviously not dangerous, as it cannot cause disease. - Mod.LK/JW]

19 Jun 2015 Ghana: Ebola trial will not harm Ghanaians - WHO assures
http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Ebola-trial-will-not-harm-Ghanaians-WHO-assures-363426
[The World Health Organization (WHO) representative in Ghana, Dr. Magdal Robalo, insisted that no Ghanian would be at risk of contracting the Ebola virus, and that the necessary standards for safety will not be ignored.]

Research
-----
17 Jun 2015 Study finds Ebola virus mutated slower than 1st thought
http://www.foxnews.com/health/2015/06/17/study-finds-ebola-virus-mutated-slower-than-first-thought/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+foxnews%2Fhealth+(Internal+-+Health+-+Text)
[The ebolavirus that devastated parts of West Africa over the past year did not mutate at a faster rate than in previous outbreaks, according to an international study published on Wed 17 Jun 2015. Contrary to research conducted early in the outbreak, which suggested the virus was mutating at twice the rate previously seen, this study showed the mutation rate was only slightly higher in the West Africa epidemic.

From Abstract. .... The origin of the particular [Ebola] virus in [Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia] and time of transmission is not known and currently relies on epidemiological analysis, which may be unreliable owing to the difficulties of obtaining patient information. Here, we trace the genetic evolution of EBOV in the current outbreak that has resulted in multiple lineages. ... Our results confirm that the EBOV from Guinea moved into Sierra Leone, most likely in April or early May [2014]. The viruses of the Guinea/Sierra Leone lineage mixed around June/July 2014. Viral sequences covering August, September and October 2014 indicate that this lineage evolved independently within Guinea. These data can be used in conjunction with epidemiological information to test retrospectively the effectiveness of control measures, and provides an unprecedented window into the evolution of an ongoing viral haemorrhagic fever outbreak. - Mod.LK]

18 Jun 2015 Pregnancy may hide symptoms of Ebola virus
http://www.echoexaminer.com/pregnancy-may-hide-symptoms-of-ebola-virus/2401/
[According to an article published by the New England Journal of Medicine, Ebola virus infection may stay in a pregnant woman's body without showing any evident manifestations. The theory behind the unusual pathogenesis is that the immunosuppression brought about by the pregnancy allowed the virus to stay longer in the woman's body without showing any symptoms.

The reference for this report is: Akerlund E1, Prescott J, Tampellini L. Shedding of Ebola Virus in an Asymptomatic Pregnant Woman N Engl J Med. 2015 Jun 18;372(25):2467-2469 (http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMc1503275). - Mod.LK]

18 Jun 2015: Ebola virus epidemiology, transmission and evolution during 7 months in Sierra Leone
http://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674%2815%2900690-X
[Studying the Ebola virus's movement over 7 months demonstrated less movement across borders than predicted. Research also discovered that early in the epidemic, the virus spread rapidly, producing many mutations. Host-to-host transmission and recurrent emergence of between-host genetic variants occurred. As the outbreak continued, the number of deleterious mutations decreased and the number of neutral mutations increased. There is initial evidence for human RNA editing effects on the Ebola genome. The full reference is: DJ Park, G Dudas, S Wohl, et al. 2015. Cell 161(7): 1516-1526 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286741500690X.]

Jun 2015: Evaluation of signature erosion in Ebola virus due to genomic drift and its impact on the performance of diagnostic assays
http://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/7/6/3130
[From abstract: Genome sequence analyses of the 2014 Ebola virus (EBOV) isolates revealed a potential problem with the diagnostic assays currently in use; i.e., drifting genomic profiles of the virus may affect the sensitivity or even produce false-negative results. We evaluated signature erosion in ebolavirus molecular assays using an in silico approach and found frequent potential false-negative and false-positive results. ... -more

19 Jun 2015: Clinical trial of experimental Ebola drug is halted
http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/20/health/clinical-trial-of-experimental-ebola-drug-is-halted.html?_r=0
[Tekmira Pharmaceuticals, reported that enrollment in a Phase II trial testing of its drug, TKM-Ebola-Guinea, had been ended because the drug was "not likely to demonstrate an overall therapeutic benefit," even if the trial had continued.
TKM-Ebola-Guinea uses RNA interference to block the action of certain genes of the Ebola virus. In non-human trials, the drug was successful in treating monkeys which had been intentionally infected with the Ebola virus. Because of this, TKM-Ebola-Guinea was considered one of the most promising treatments.]

18 Jun 2015 Liberia: Thousands of Liberians in 'post-Ebola syndrome' study
http://www.nation.co.ke/lifestyle/health/Thousands-suffer-post-Ebola-syndrome-study/-/1954202/2755946/-/s9rir6z/-/index.html
[On 17 Jun 2015, Liberia commenced a 5-year study on the long-term health impact the Ebola virus disease had on its survivors.]

Funding
------
17 Jun 2015 Ebola's most affected countries lobby for funds for hospital infrastructure
http://www.thesierraleonetelegraph.com/?p=9540
[To address Liberia's problematic healthcare system, newly appointed health minister, Bernice Dahn, Liberia's former Chief Medical Officer, had a long wish list of solutions. They included the building of new health facilities, enhancement of diagnostic services, an emergency preparedness and response structure, the hiring of qualified personnel to work in health facilities and a commitment of more money to the sector. "Our healthcare infrastructure was not built to respond to infectious diseases," explained the minister.

Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia, Ernest Bai Koroma of Sierra Leone, and Alpha Conde of Guinea are jointly canvassing for global financial assistance to revamp healthcare infrastructure and restore social services in their countries. Their core message is that quality healthcare enables socioeconomic development. - Mod.LK]

[An audio recording has been produced of officials in a charitable organization and funding source instructing others to falsify records and to not disclose this practice to others. ... - more

There appears to be a serious problem keeping track of donated money to assure it is used as intended. Misuse of donated money complicates requests for funding for much-needed hospital infrastructure improvement. - Mod.LK]
