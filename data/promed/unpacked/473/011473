[The number of KFD cases is steadily increasing with 5 deaths in Shivamogga district of Karnataka since the beginning of 2020, the latest cluster of 3 cases from Sagar taluk is in fact one each from 3 villages. There is a need for setting up active surveillance for KFD in the districts reporting a high number of cases with robust animal surveillance for early detection and response; as well as risk communication with community engagement to control the spread. - Mod.UBA]
