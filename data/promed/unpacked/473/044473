A grammar school student from Klungkung in East Bali is the Island's latest fatality attributed to rabies.

A 12-year-old girl from the village of Bungbungan died on Wed 8 Jul 2015, less than 2 weeks after another [12-year-old] child from Getakan Village, also in Klungkung, succumbed to the disease. [This latest case] died in the isolation ward of the Klungkung General Hospital at mid-day on Wednesday [8 Jul 2015] after being hospitalized for one day with clinical symptoms of rabies that included a stiff neck, breathing difficulties, hydrophobia and a generalized state of panic.

As reported by NusaBali, the young girl was scratched by a pet cat during a visit to Buleleng in North Bali on 23 Jun 2015. Ten days after the incident, the young girl fell ill, her health continuing to decline until her death on 8 Jul 2015.

After the girl's death and as a precautionary step by health officials, 7 members of her family were given anti-rabies vaccine (VAR) in a course of medication that will last 21-days.

Of the 10 deaths in Bali thus far in 2015 linked to rabies, 3 have occurred in Buleleng, 2 in Klungkung, and one each in Badung, Gianyar, Bangli, Tabanan and Karangasem.

[A 10-day incubation period for rabies is very short, and, probably, there was an exposure near the face; maybe this cat licked her, something people forget. It is concerning that in checking the ProMED archives for rabies cases in Indonesia, some 85 percent are reported in Bali. Logically, there is an urgent need to import dog vaccine (which can be used on cats) and thus radically, quickly, and cheaply reduce the risk to humans of this disease.

Bali is a small island at the eastern end of Java. A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map showing the location of Bali can be accessed at: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3508205,556. Also see: http://www.lonelyplanet.com/maps/asia/indonesia/bali/ for a more detailed map. - Mod.MHJ]
