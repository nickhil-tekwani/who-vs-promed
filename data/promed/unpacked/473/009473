NORWALK-LIKE VIRUS, DECONTAMINATION: RFI

Request for Information: Norwalk-like Virus Decontamination
-----------------------------------------------------------
There have been many outbreaks of Norwalk-like virus infection
reported in ProMED-mail over the past several months, including
outbreaks in hospitals, schools, restaurants, resorts, and cruise
ships. The primary compound that is recommended for decontamination
of soiled (and potentially contaminated) surfaces is sodium
hypochlorite in concentrations of 500 to 10 000 PPM. Such
concentrations can cause significant damage to many surfaces such as
wood, fabric, and rugs. This may not be a significant issue in many
hospitals, but for resorts, restaurants, or cruise ships it can
result in costly damage to furnishings if the sodium hypochlorite
solution is applied directly or accidentally. Typically, draperies
can be washed in a hot cycle and furniture and carpets can be
steam-cleaned for potential surface contamination. Other surfaces,
such as tables, counters, walls, railings, and floors require
cleansing with some type of decontaminant, sodium hypochlorite
currently being the preferred solution.
Are there any other compounds considered to be effective for the
decontamination of Norwalk-like virus that are less damaging to
fabrics and wood? Any suggestions on how to clean/decontaminate
sodium hypochlorite-"sensitive" materials and surfaces?

[Norwalk-like viruses are acid-resistant, ether-resistant, and
relatively heat-stable. Consequently chlorine-based products are
recommended for decontamination. Is there an alternative strategy? -
