New Brunswick potato farmers face heavy losses due to weather
---------------------------------------------------
About a dozen New Brunswick potato farmers are facing millions of dollars
in losses due to last summer's wet weather and a warm autumn. Patton
MacDonald, Potatoes New Brunswick executive director, said pink rot, which
has affected 10 to 15 farms this year, might lead some farmers to leave the
business. He said that the crop on some farms has been lost.
Dr. Khalil Al-Mughrabi, New Brunswick's potato pathologist, said the
problem follows frequent and excessive rain, along with high humidity
levels during the growing season. An abnormally warm harvest is making it
difficult for growers to cool and dry their storage.
Pink rot causes potato flesh to turn from white to salmon pink. The potato
is still safe to eat, but it's difficult to market.
91 potato producers are currently enrolled in the New Brunswick Crop
Insurance Program, which covers production losses caused by natural perils
beyond a producer's control. They produced about 40 per cent of the 2004
crop. MacDonald said that so far, PR is affecting a relatively small number
of the province's estimated 300 potato farms.

[Pink rot [PR] is caused by the fungus _Phytophthora erythroseptica_ [Pe].
PR symptoms are typically observed in tubers, but severe infections may
develop foliar symptoms such as wilting, yellowing, and aerial tubers.
Infected tubers exude a clear, watery liquid and potato tissues remains
intact, but are rubbery. Affected tubers are susceptible to bacterial
diseases, especially soft rot caused by _Erwinia carotovora_. Pe lives in
soil and can infect any below-ground part of the plant. Disease management
strategies include avoiding irrigation in the late growing season,
particularly if temperatures stay above 75 deg F. Irrigation management and
humidity control are crucial to disease control. Potatoes must be sorted so
as to isolate infected tubers from healthy ones. Early curing conditions
should be 45-50 deg F during drying. Continuous air flow in storage bins is
essential during this period. Resistance of Pe to chemical fungicides such
as metalaxyl (Ridomil) and mefenoxam has been reported from several
locations in the US and Canada, but the majority of the population remains
sensitive. Resistance to PR has been noted from Idaho to Maine and east to
New Brunswick.
ProMED-mail has no financial interest in Ridomil or similar compounds.
