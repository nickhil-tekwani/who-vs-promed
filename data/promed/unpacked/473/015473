The epidemiological map of the Ministry of Health shows that at
the national level, there have been 634 dengue cases with one death
from DHF, 4 cases of yellow fever with 3 deaths, 3 cases of
hantavirus [infection], 32 confirmed and 800 suspected cases of
leptospirosis in Chuquisaca.

[One wonders how many of the hundreds of suspected cases of
leptospirosis, which also causes jaundice, might turn out to be YF if
tested. - Mod.JW]

[Information on the number of suspected cases of yellow fever
reported in Bolivia since 1 Jan 2007 by department and epidemiologic
week can be found at
<http://www.sns.gov.bo/bolsns/Vigilancia2007.htm#FIEBREAMARILLA>. As
of week 9 (the end of February) there have been 33 suspected cases of
yellow fever reported from 3 different departments (Cochabamba, La
Paz and Santa Cruz). In the Epidemiologic Bulletin of 10 Mar 2007
(covering epidemiologic weeks 5-8), there is mention that of 30
suspected cases of yellow fever reported for 2007, only 2 had
laboratory confirmation (see
<http://www.sns.gov.bo/reloaa1/boletines_vigil/BOLETIN%2005al08-07.pdf>).
The above newswire is unclear as to whether these 4 reported cases of
yellow fever are confirmed or suspected. In addition, the newswire
is unclear as to the geographic location of these reported cases.
More information from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
