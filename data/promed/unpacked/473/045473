[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is considered endemic in Pakistan with sporadic outbreaks occurring every year. Since the diagnosis of the 1st human case of CCHF in 1976, sporadic cases have been reported from different regions across Pakistan. Between 2011-2015 over 300 CCHF cases were confirmed in the country. Balochistan, however, remains the most affected province with over 50 per cent of the total cases (http://nih.org.pk/files/Newsletter/Seasoanl%20Awareness%20and%20Alert%20Letter%20(SAAL)%2036th%20Issue.pdf).

The report above pertains to identification of 3 cases of CCHF currently under treatment in a local hospital of the provincial capital, Quetta. 2 new cases have been identified as residents of Loralai district in the north-east of Balochistan province in Pakistan.

In order to limit the morbidity and mortality due to CCHF, prevention and control efforts should focus on reducing the risk of tick-to-human, animal-to-human and human-to-human contact transmission in the community through awareness campaigns, use of protective clothing, acaricides and repellents, quarantine of animals and their pre-treatment with pesticide and ensuring implementation of infection prevention and control programs at the health facilities to check nosocomial spread of the virus (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs208/en/). - Mod.UBA
