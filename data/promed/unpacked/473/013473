According to official statistics, hepatitis C virus infections in Georgia have hit record levels, with 200 000 infected currently and 2000 new cases emerging annually.

According to experts, the death rate is also high, as the treatment of the disease is expensive. Moreover, there is no state program for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis C. The official statistics show that only 10 per cent of the infected can afford treatment.

As the Public Speaker of Georgia reported on Monday [22 Jul 2013], Georgia holds 1st place in the South Caucasus region in respect to number of people infected with hepatitis C virus.

[Hepatitis C is a liver disease caused by hepatitis C virus. The disease can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong condition that can lead to cirrhosis of the liver or liver cancer. Hepatitis C virus is transmitted through contact with the blood of an infected person. There is currently no vaccine, but hepatitis C can be treated. Currently treatment is expensive and subject to restrictions. There are 6 genotypes of the hepatitis C virus and they may respond differently to treatment. Combination antiviral therapy with interferon and ribavirin has been the mainstay of hepatitis C treatment. Interferon is expensive and it is not always well tolerated. Some virus genotypes respond better to interferon than others; 2 new therapeutic agents, telaprevir and boceprevir, have recently been licensed in some countries (see: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs164/en/index.html).
