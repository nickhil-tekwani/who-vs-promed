At the competition of the Winter Equestrian Festival in Florida, another horse has tested positive for rhino. A few weeks ago, this was also the case. The horse had a fever on Thursday [1 Apr 2021] but showed no clinical signs. Three corridors in the stable tent have been quarantined. The organization itself came out with the news.

Thursday [1 Apr 2021] the horse was tested because of the fever, and the nose test was positive. The blood test was negative. The horse was taken to the Florida clinic.

The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services confirmed one case of equine herpesvirus at a boarding facility in Duval County. Another horse on the premises is positive for EHV-1 but had no neurologic signs at the time of this report.

A single horse with neurological signs was reported by a private veterinary practitioner in Duval County on 28 Mar 2021. Test results completed 30 Mar [2021] were positive for equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1). The horse is currently being treated at a separate isolation facility.

A 2nd febrile horse on the premises has tested positive for EHV-1, but currently has no neurologic signs.

The Division of Animal Industry has placed a quarantine on the premises, and an investigation is ongoing. There is no known epidemiological link between the horses on the Duval County premises and the positive EHV-1 cases reported in early March [2021] in Marion County.

The Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) received confirmation of equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM), the neurologic disease linked to equine herpesvirus (EHV-1), in a Parker County Quarter Horse on 25 Mar 2021. This is the 1st positive detection of EHM in Texas this year [2021].

The horse was tested after showing neurologic signs consistent with EHM. The premises has been quarantined, and TAHC staff are working closely with the owner and local veterinarian to monitor the infected horse and enforce biosecurity measures on the premises.

"The positive horse has not recently attended any events or known to have come in direct contact with horses from other premises," said Dr. Andy Schwartz, State Veterinarian and TAHC Executive Director. "Since EHM is transmitted through direct horse-to-horse contact, short-distance aerosol, or contaminated tack, we believe the risk for disease transmission is very low."

EHM is a neurologic disease of horses linked to the equine herpesvirus. Neurological signs appear as a result of damage to blood vessels in the brain and spinal cord. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include
- fever of 102 deg F [38.9 deg C] or greater (fever most often comes before neurologic signs);
- nasal discharge;
- lack of coordination, hindquarter weakness, leaning or resting against a fence or wall to maintain balance;
- lethargy;
- urine dribbling;
- head tilt;
- diminished tail tone;
- and penile paralysis.

It is important to remember these signs are not specific to EHM, and diagnostic testing is required to confirm EHV-1 infection. If you suspect your horse has been exposed to EHV-1, contact your local veterinarian. For more information on EHM please visit https://www.tahc.texas.gov/news/brochures/TAHCBrochure_EquineHerpesMyeloencephalopathy.pdf.

The equine industry is encouraged to obtain the latest information on equine disease events across the country on the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) website (http://www.equinediseasecc.org/alerts/outbreaks). Subsequent Texas EHM cases will be posted on the EDCC.

Following is a 3 Apr [2021] update from the Kentucky State Veterinarian's office about the EHV-1 incident at Blackwood Training Center in Woodford County, Kentucky.

Kentucky State Veterinarian's Office

The Kentucky State Veterinarian's office is also taking this opportunity to share their understanding of the latest developments at Laurel and Pimlico racetracks in Maryland.

Blackwood Training Center
Woodford County, Kentucky
------------------------------
Results of testing on the samples (nasal swabs and whole blood - EDTA) collected from each horse stabled in Barn B at Blackwood Training Center in Woodford County, Kentucky, on [Wed 31 Mar 2021] have been reported negative for detection of equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) DNA by PCR testing. In addition to the testing being completed, the horses have been monitored daily, and our findings support it has been greater than 14 days since any horse in Barn B was last potentially exposed to a clinical case.

Meeting the criteria above provided us the confidence needed to release the group of horses in Barn B from restriction and allow them to resume their normal training and racing activities beginning on [Fri 2 Apr 2021].

Daily monitoring of the horses stabled in Barn A at Blackwood Training Center continues. There have been no additional fevers or other clinical signs in the group of horses, and we have tentatively scheduled the horses in Barn A to be sampled (nasal swabs and whole blood) and tested by PCR later the week of 5 Apr [2021].

The Kentucky State Veterinarian's office staff will be providing and distributing a general summary update late the week of 5 Apr [2021] when results from the planned testing at Blackwood become available.

Maryland: Laurel and Pimlico
-----------------------------
Published reports and conversations with animal health officials in Maryland suggest the situation at Laurel continues to evolve as additional positive samples have been collected from nonclinical horses as well as a few horses exhibiting clinical signs.

The Maryland State Veterinarian and the Stronach Group have decided the plan moving forward is to only sample and test symptomatic horses in the affected barns. Currently, their criteria for quarantine release will be 21 days of no clinical signs reported.

This plan relies strictly on grooms/trainers/vets to report fever or other evidence of illness, which, in our opinion, might result in lack of detection of circulating virus. This protocol is in direct contrast to the testing protocols we have developed in consultation with infectious disease experts and which I feel has aided our ability to maintain racing schedules/calendars with minimal disruption and inconvenience to the majority of horsemen.

In light of the current information available to us, we are in the process of developing strategies to mitigate what would be considered an elevated risk to our populations here in Kentucky should Maryland release the imposed restrictions without diagnostically demonstrating the horses and environment are free of evidence of virus circulating.

The probability is that horses having recently been (date to be determined by Kentucky officials) at Laurel or Pimlico will require Kentucky's Office of State Veterinarian approval prior to entering Kentucky.

These horses will likely be restricted and require veterinary examination and testing before being allowed to enter a Kentucky racetrack or sanctioned facility.

This protocol has worked well in the past when we've had to address disease events in other states where horses were released from restrictions without testing.

[It is a busy year already with equine rhino, also known as equine herpes. It would be so helpful if we had a vaccine against all the forms of this horrible disease.

"Equine herpesvirus (EHV), also known as equine rhinopneumonitis, is a highly infectious Alphaherpesviridae found virtually worldwide. There are currently 9 known EHVs. EHV-1, EHV-3, and EHV-4 pose the highest disease risk in the US horse population. EHV-1 and EHV-4 can cause upper respiratory disease, neurological disease, abortions, and/or neonatal death. EHV-3 causes a venereal disease called coital exanthema. In recent years there has been an increase in the number of EHV-1 neurologic cases, also referred to as equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM). The virus incubation period is highly variable and can be as long as 14 days. Prognosis is good for horses not affected with the neurologic form and varies for those with neurologic signs. EHV has not been shown to be zoonotic.

"Vaccines are available to prevent the respiratory and abortion forms of EHV, but none are labeled as effective against the neurologic form of the disease (EHM). Vaccination may reduce the severity of clinical signs and may lead to reduced viral shedding. In breeding operations, the use of vaccination appears to be effective at reducing the risk of EHV-1 and EHV-4 abortions, and its use is strongly recommended. Pregnant mares with foals at their side should be kept in small groups and prevented from contacting new introductions. Isolate new horses for a minimum of 21 days (30 is strongly recommended); this includes returning horses who have left the farm to attend any event. Practice good hygiene and biosecurity.

"Equine herpesvirus (EHV-1 and EHV-4) is spread via nose-to-nose contact, contaminated equipment (water and feed buckets, tack and grooming supplies, and shoes) and respiratory secretions within stalls/stables. Aborted fetuses and after-birth can also contain the virus. EHV-3 is spread through venereal transmission or contaminated equipment used for breeding."

"Clinical signs of EHV-1 and EHV-4:
Clinical signs may be nonspecific, and some horses may be nonclinical.
- fever
- difficulty urinating
- nasal discharge and cough
- depression
- head tilt
- loss of tail tone
- stumbling or weakness in the hind limbs, which may progress to all limbs
- down and unable to rise"

"Actions to take if you suspect an infection:
1. Call your veterinarian.
2. Isolate affected horse(s) from healthy horses.
3. Clean and disinfect all water/feed buckets, mucking equipment, tack, and any other equipment that may have come into close contact with the affected horse.
4. It is strongly recommended that each new horse introduction to the property adhere to a minimum 30-day quarantine/isolation period during which time the horse can be monitored for signs of infectious disease and be housed in a separate location on the property well away from resident horses."

"Treatment consists of supportive care, which may include IV fluid therapy and anti-inflammatories to reduce fever. In more severe neurologic cases, treatment may require hospitalization with more intensive veterinary care. The majority of horses with uncomplicated infections recover."
