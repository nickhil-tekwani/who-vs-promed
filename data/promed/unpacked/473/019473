160 hit by typhoid in Wau
--------------------------
160 students from the Grace Memorial High School in Wau have been
infected by typhoid. Morobe health adviser Dr Likei Theo confirmed
the outbreak, which hit the first group of students 3 weeks ago.
Dr Theo said that as of Thu, 4 Mar 2004, 160 students have been
treated at the Bulolo Health Center and released. However, he said
there is a possibility that many in the vicinity of the school are
likely to be affected.
He said the typhoid outbreak is confined to the school community
alone, and health authorities are working to ensure there is enough
stock of medical supplies at the Bulolo Health Center to contain
further outbreak of the sickness. Dr Theo said there were no deaths,
but the threat of typhoid spreading to the whole school community is
serious.
He said health workers are already investigating the cause of the
outbreak while keeping the school open for classes. "We are trying
our best to keep the school from closing," he said.
A student, who fled the school, said that there had been no classes
since Mon, 1 Mar 2004, and most students were staying away from
classes for fear of catching typhoid. The student -- who refused to
be named -- said that most students are too scared to return to
classes.
"Most students are falling ill with severe coughing and other signs
of typhoid," the student said.

[The Morobe Province, with a population of approximately 500 000, is
Papua New Guinea's gateway to the Highlands and Islands regions.
There are 9 districts within the Morobe Province, in which 171
distinct languages are spoken. It is also noted as the last stop for
American aviator Amelia Earhardt before she disappeared over the
Pacific Ocean, on her way to back to Oakland, California, USA.
No information is given regarding the diagnostic criteria for typhoid
in this outbreak, i.e., clinical, serological, or microbiological.
Confirmation of the diagnosis is particularly relevant, since it
appears that many of the afflicted students seem to have had
respiratory symptoms, certainly not the hallmark of this infection.
Since the method of transmission of typhoid fever is ingestion of
contaminated food or water, if this is typhoid, the classroom is not
the problem -- but rather the cafeteria. - Mod.LL]
