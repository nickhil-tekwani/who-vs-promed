Whooping cough cases shot up by more than 50 percent in the past year with an alarming increase in babies diagnosed with the potentially deadly infection. There were 4606 cases of whooping cough, also known as pertussis, between January 2014-2015. The largest increases were in children aged 10-14 and babies under 6 months. In a warning to clinicians and public health personnel, Chief Health Officer Rosemary Lester said infants of this age were also the most susceptible to the severe complications of pertussis. One in every 200 babies that contracts the infection will die.

The latest data from the [Victoria] Department of Health showed a 43 percent increase in whooping cough cases in patients aged 10-14 to 6 Jan 2015. There was also a 38 percent rise in babies aged under 6 months, increasing to 76 cases in 2014 from 55 in 2013.

Figures obtained from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System show 1383 Queenslanders tested positive to the vaccine preventable bacterial disease in 2014, a rate of 29.7 cases per 100 000 people. The numbers were less than half those recorded in 2013 and 1/5th of those seen in 2012. They are the lowest for whooping cough in Queensland since 2004 when doctors reported 1034 cases -- 26.5 cases per 100 000 people. Queensland's 2014 figures were much lower than in New South Wales, which recorded 3023 cases, a rate of 40.8 cases per 100 000 population.

Queensland Health's acting senior communicable diseases director Heidi Carroll said the drastically reduced numbers in the state were pleasing, but it was too early to say whether the fall was attributable to the statewide immunization strategy launched in 2014.

"We are only 7 months into the implementation of the immunization strategy, which has set a target of 95 percent of all children being fully vaccinated," Dr Carroll said. "It is the only target of its kind in Australia.

"Current figures show that we are hovering around the 91 percent mark for 1-year-olds, 93 percent for 2-year-olds and 92 percent for 5-year-olds."

Dr Carroll said whooping cough was a highly contagious and very serious disease for babies and young children. "By reducing the amount in the community, we are helping to minimize their exposure to the bacterium," she said. "However, while rates may have declined, we still have 1300 cases, too many for a virus that is entirely preventable through vaccination."
