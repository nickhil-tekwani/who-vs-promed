Biologists are seeing a notable drop in the brown trout population in the Big Hole River [Beaverhead County] following a fungal outbreak. An outbreak of a fungal infection known as saprolegnia occurred on the Big Hole River in the fall of 2014. The outbreak was centered on a stretch of the Big Hole from Jerry Creek to Brownes Bridge affecting mainly spawning brown trout.

Through their spring population surveys, fisheries biologists have recorded a notable drop in the brown trout population in that area. However, they conclude that the previous record high brown trout population in the river likely contributed to the spread of the fungus in 2014.

Saprolegnia is a naturally occurring fungus present in nearly all waters at all times of the year. The immune system of healthy, non-stressed fish is able to combat the disease and these fish are not affected. Generally saprolegnia infects fish that are already diseased, stressed, or otherwise weakened. The infection appears as large, white, cotton-like blotches on the skin and fins.

Big Hole brown trout population surveys conducted in the spring of 2014, prior to the fungus outbreak, indicated numbers of fish in the Melrose area were at record levels of 1871 per mile [1163 per km] (compared to long-term averages of about 960 per mile [597 per km]). The 2015 surveys show the population declined 824 brown trout per mile [512 per km] .

Biologist Jim Olsen says it's important to keep the numbers in perspective. "While the decline from 2014 to 2015 was notable, the population is still only slightly below the long-term average for brown trout density," he said. "At the same time, rainbow trout density actually increased in that area from 291 fish per mile [181 per km] in 2014 to 436 fish per mile [271 per km] in 2015."

Olsen also stressed that the high number of brown trout in the river likely contributed to the spread of the _Saprolegnia_ fungus in the fall.

"High population densities lead to close proximity of fish and higher spore production from the fungus, particularly at spawning areas leading to increased transmission of the disease between individuals," he said. "The high density of fish also likely lead to poorer condition of the fish going into the spawning season, and thus greater susceptibility to the disease."

Nearby stretches of river had a less a dramatic impact from the infection. For example, upstream at Jerry Creek, the population decreased from 1280 brown trout per mile to 980 brown trout per mile.

Because the fungus only impacted spawning brown trout (and to a lesser extent spawning mountain whitefish), there are still plenty of smaller fish in the 10-13 inch [25-33 cm] range that will quickly grow and replace those fish lost to disease. Further, the decline in brown trout numbers will result in more food resources being available for larger brown trout that survived the disease outbreak. The size and condition of surviving fish should improve.

FWP will conduct additional monitoring in the fall of 2015 to determine if the fungus outbreak is still present.

[Many oomycetes species from the order Saprolegniales can infect and cause disease in fish and other aquatic animals (such as, shellfish and amphibians). Common species of _Saprolegnia_ in fresh water include _S. diclina_, _S. ferax_, _S. hypogyna_, and _S. parasitica_. In salmonid fish (salmons, trouts), most infections are caused by _S. diclina_ type I.

Most _Saprolegnia_ spp. are not obligate parasites. They are normally saprophytic but they are capable of parasitic existence. In general, they are secondary pathogens, but it may act as primary given the right circumstances. Infections cause epidermal damage, including necrosis, and can often be fatal. In nature, saprolegnia is not thought to pose a large threat to populations of fish as it mostly infects wounded or otherwise immune-compromised animals. Fish have developed a mucus coat that, amongst other things, helps repel and shed saprolegnia cysts.
