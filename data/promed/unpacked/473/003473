[This outbreak seems to have disappeared from the news in the last 10 days,
without any report on the final lab diagnosis of the flu strain involved.
If anyone has that information, we would be very glad if they would tell us
- Mod.JW

An unidentified strain of viral influenza has killed at least 254 people in
five districts of west Nepal this month and affected 7,000 others, Home
Ministry spokesman Gopendra Pandey said quoting latest reports from the
region.
Blood samples have been sent to Bangkok to identify the virus because of
inadequate facilities in Nepal, officials said.
At least 163 people, including women and children, have died in 10 villages
of Kalikot, which is the worst affected district, Pandey said.
