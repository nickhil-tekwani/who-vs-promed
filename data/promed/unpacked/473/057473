Blue ear disease attacks pigs in northern Viet Nam
------------------------------------------------------------
Hundreds of pigs have died since last month in northern Viet Nam of
Porcine Reproductive & Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS). The Central
Steering Committee for avian influenza control and the Animal Health
Department Tuesday [10 Apr 2007] held a meeting and announced that
PRRS, also known as blue ear disease, had infected Hung Yen, Bac
Ninh, Bac Giang, and Thai Binh provinces, and Hai Phong and Hanoi cities.
The disease 1st broke out in Hai Duong where tens of thousands of
pigs are now infected. Trinh Van Quyet, Hung Yen veterinary
department head, said more than 1000 pigs in 8 out of 10 districts in
his province had been infected, 217 fatally. Many pig farmers have
gone bankrupt.
As the name suggests, the disease causes blueing of the ears. In
addition, symptoms include lack of appetite, high fever, miscarriage
and premature delivery among sows, coughing and respiratory problems,
and death in extreme cases.

[Borrowing from ProMED-mail's veterinary moderator PC's comment in
ProMED-mail posting Porcine reproductive & respiratory syndrome -
South Africa 20040621.1658:
"This disease emerged in North America and Europe, roughly
simultaneously, in the late 1980s. It was first called by the
wonderfully descriptive title of Mystery Swine Disease. It is also
commonly found in Asia. Its spread to Africa really does complete the
picture of a pandemic that has relentlessly but not very rapidly
spread across a wide swath of the world.
The disease is characterized by late-term abortions, stillbirths,
piglets born weak, and respiratory signs in pigs of all ages.
Production losses from the disease are severe. It is a very damaging
disease economically, as the fruit of much the investment on a swine
farm is lost through abortion and infertility."
