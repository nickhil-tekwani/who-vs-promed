Advisory Regarding Possible Feed Contamination
----------------------------------------------------
During the past 48 hours, the media has focused on a situation in Texas
regarding a possible feed contamination issue. We are taking this
opportunity to advise you of the facts surrounding this situation, in order
to avert undue concern:
According to reports from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), about a
week ago, some cattle in a Texas feedlot may have consumed some feed [of US
origin] containing mammalian protein (meat and bone meal). Since l997, the
FDA has banned mammalian protein in feed for ruminants (multi-stomached
animals), such as cattle.
The error was noted within hours and was reported by the feed manufacturer
to the FDA. The use of the lot of feed in question was suspended and the
feedlot is voluntarily holding the cattle on site. The FDA is analyzing
samples of the feed. The feed analysis should be complete by Monday evening,
29 Jan 2001, at which time the FDA will evaluate the next step regarding
these animals. FDA officials expect to make a decision regarding the animals
by 31 Jan.2001.
Some salient points:
* This is not a disease situation.
* The FDA is determining if mammalian protein is contained in this feed.
(The meat and bone meal, if present, was derived from US-origin animals.)
*This situation is NOT a disease issue. It is a possible contaminated, or
adulterated, feed occurrence and is under the jurisdiction of the FDA.
* The US does not have BSE, and the ban on feeding mammalian protein to
ruminants is a preemptive precaution.
* The FDA has not released the name of the feed company or the feedlot and
its location.
Please refer interested parties to Mr. Lawrence Bachorik, at the Food and
Drug Administration, which is in charge of this situation. Mr. Bachorik's
number is 1-301-827-6250.
