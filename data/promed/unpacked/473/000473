10 additional people have come down with brucellosis after consuming camel milk, it was revealed today (Thursday, 8 Sep 2016) when the Ministry of Health extended the administrative closure of a business dealing with this product. A month ago, it was reported that 2 children were hospitalized in mild to moderate condition at the Ichilov Hospital [Tel-Aviv] with brucellosis resulting of drinking the said milk.

Concurrently, the Be'er Sheva Magistrate indicted E.L., the manager of an enterprise engaged with the storage and marketing of milk and milk products "Green for Life" or "Genesis Milk" in Moshav Sitria, Shefela district. Prof. Shmuel Rishpon, Acting District Medical Officer [DMO] - Center District, signed today the extension of the closure order of the business, issued by the DMO/Center, Dr. Ofra Havkin, on 11 Aug 2016, for 30 additional days.

The Acting DMO's decision stated that the closure order was extended because during an inspection/control visit to the enterprise, performed about 2 weeks ago, it was found that -- in breach with the previous order -- camel milk was encountered in the premises. Even worse, since the decree was issued last month, information on 10 additional brucellosis patients, infected by the consumption of the milk, has been obtained. "This situation is indicative of continued immediate danger to public health from the consumption of the camel milk," Prof Rishpon stated in the issued order.

The Ministry warned the public previously to refrain from the consumption and use of any milk products from unknown sources and unpasteurized. The camel milk produced by the manufacturer in Sitria is not pasteurized, therefore dangerous for the public health.

The _Brucella_ bacterium, causing the brucellosis disease, is difficult to diagnose because of the varied symptoms. Among other things, they include prolonged fever, night sweats, malaise, depression, headaches and limb aches, enlarged lymph nodes and liver and spleen enlargement. In the absence of timely diagnosis it can cause serious complications to death.

[The above information is mainly based upon a press release of the Ministry of Health, published on Thu 8 Sep 2016, with the new closure order appended; both are available (in Hebrew) at http://www.health.gov.il/NewsAndEvents/SpokemanMesseges/Pages/08092016_1.aspx.

It would be interesting to note if an epidemiological investigation, addressing the distribution routes of the unpasteurised camel milk and potential consumers, has/is being undertaken by the health authorities. In view of the considerable quantities of (unpasteurised) camel milk found and destroyed last month in the plant, the continued activity in breach of the initial closure order, the possibility that marketed milk may have been infected for several months, and taking into account the high incidence of _B. melitensis_ in small ruminants in southern Israel, where the producing camels are/were kept while exposed to infection, infection in other consumers, in addition to the 12 already identified, deserves to be excluded.

To the list of the complications of human brucellosis, orchitis [inflammation of testicles] and abortion deserve to be added as well as endocarditis, osteomyelitis and other localized infection. - Mods.AS/DK
