Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Birds / 489 500 / 46 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: a commercial layer and rearing chicken farm

*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: as part of routine surveillance for infectious bursal disease (IBD) virus by the poultry industry, 10 layer hens tested seropositive in a chicken flock near Dunedin in the South Island of New Zealand. Further testing as part of a Ministry for Primary Industries [MPI] investigation has found evidence of infection in 2 additional layer flocks and 3 rearer flocks on the same farm. No clinical disease or change in production parameters is evident in any of the positive flocks. MPI is undertaking a pathway assessment, but as the findings are isolated to premises with a high health status and there are no clinical signs, MPI is considering whether this finding may be vaccine-associated. New Zealand previously had an incursion of a vaccine associated infectious bursal disease virus serotype 1 in 1993. The incursion was attributed to the use of a contaminated vaccine in a single hatchery. An industry led eradication programme was undertaken with the last serum reactor farm removed in 1999. Since that time, the New Zealand poultry industry have run a sero-surveillance programme with annual testing of commercial layer, rearing, meat-chicken and meat-chicken breeder farms. A non-pathogenic infectious bursal disease virus serotype 2 (IBDV2) has been previously recognised as present in New Zealand (Rawdon et al, 2019). This notification is being provided on the basis of preliminary test results suggesting the presence of a strain of infectious bursal disease virus serotype 1. Further testing is being completed at the OIE reference laboratory in France to confirm these initial results. A follow-up report will be provided to confirm or annul this report.

["Infectious bursal disease (IBD) virus (IBDV, genus _Avibirnavirus_, family Birnaviridae) infects chickens, turkeys, ducks, guinea fowl, and ostriches, but causes clinical disease solely in young chickens. Severe acute disease, usually at 3- to 6-week-old birds, is associated with high mortality, but less acute or subclinical infections are common earlier in life. IBDV causes lymphoid depletion in the bursa of Fabricius. Significant depression of the humoral antibody responses may result, thus promoting secondary infections. 2 serotypes of IBDV, designated serotypes 1 and 2, are recognised. Clinical disease has been associated only with serotype 1, against which all commercial vaccines are prepared. Some antigenic variants of serotype 1 IBDV may require special vaccines for maximum protection. Very virulent strains of serotype 1 IBDV are common worldwide and cause serious disease.

"Clinical IBD, also known as Gumboro disease, can be diagnosed by a combination of characteristic signs and post-mortem lesions. Subclinical IBD can be confirmed in the laboratory by demonstrating a humoral immune response in unvaccinated chickens, or by detecting viral antigens or viral genome in tissues. In the absence of such tests, histological examination of bursae may be helpful."
