Scientists at the University of Liverpool have identified a single genetic change in salmonella that is playing a key role in the devastating epidemic of bloodstream infections currently killing around 400 000 people each year in sub-Saharan Africa. Invasive non-typhoidal salmonellosis (iNTS) occurs when salmonella bacteria, which normally cause gastrointestinal illness, enter the bloodstream and spread through the human body. The African iNTS epidemic is caused by a variant of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium (ST [sequence type] 313) that is resistant to antimicrobials and generally affects individuals with immune systems weakened by malaria or HIV.

In a new study published in PNAS [Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA], a team of researchers led by Professor Jay Hinton at the University of Liverpool have identified a specific genetic change, or single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), that helps the African salmonella to survive in the human bloodstream. Professor Hinton explained: "Pinpointing this single letter of DNA is an exciting breakthrough in our understanding of why African salmonella causes such a devastating disease, and helps to explain how this dangerous type of salmonella evolved."

SNPs represent a change of just one letter in the DNA sequence and there are thousands of SNP differences between different types of salmonella. Until now, it has been hard to link an individual SNP to the ability of bacteria to cause disease. Using a type of RNA analysis called transcriptomics, the scientists identified SNPs that affected the level of expression of important salmonella genes. After studying 1000 different SNPs, they found a single nucleotide difference that is unique to the African ST313 strain and causes high expression of a virulence factor called PgtE that prevents salmonella being killed in the bloodstream. The scientists then used an advanced genetic technique to switch the SNP found in the African strain to the version found in the type of salmonella that causes food poisoning and gastroenteritis globally. Finally, they used an animal infection model to show that the bacteria with the altered SNP had lost their ability to cause disease.

Professor Hinton added: "We've developed a new investigative approach to understand bacterial infection, which is the culmination of 6 years of work. This combination of genomics and transcriptomics could bring new insights to other important pathogens, and prepare us for future epidemics."

Professor Melita Gordon, a University of Liverpool clinician-scientist working in Malawi, who was involved in the project, said: "The ability of iNTS salmonella strains to cause such serious disease leads to devastating and frequently fatal consequences for very young children, and for adults who may be the chief breadwinners in their homes and communities. We see iNTS disease placing an enormous burden on thinly-stretched local health facilities and hospitals in Malawi, particularly because diagnosis is difficult, and treatment options are limited. It is now urgent that a vaccine is developed to combat this dangerous infection."

"Abstract
---------
_Salmonella enterica_ serovar Typhimurium ST313 is a relatively newly emerged sequence type that is causing a devastating epidemic of bloodstream infections across sub-Saharan Africa. Analysis of hundreds of salmonella genomes has revealed that ST313 is closely related to the ST19 group of _S._ Typhimurium that cause gastroenteritis across the world. The core genomes of ST313 and ST19 vary by only ∼1000 SNPs. We hypothesized that the phenotypic differences that distinguish African salmonella from ST19 are caused by certain SNPs that directly modulate the transcription of virulence genes. Here we identified 3597 transcriptional start sites of the ST313 strain D23580, and searched for a gene-expression signature linked to pathogenesis of salmonella. We identified a SNP in the promoter of the pgtE gene that caused high expression of the PgtE virulence factor in African _S._ Typhimurium, increased the degradation of the factor B component of human complement, contributed to serum resistance, and modulated virulence in the chicken infection model. We propose that high levels of PgtE expression by African _S._ Typhimurium ST313 promote bacterial survival and dissemination during human infection. Our finding of a functional role for an extragenic SNP shows that approaches used to deduce the evolution of virulence in bacterial pathogens should include a focus on noncoding regions of the genome.

"Significance
-------------
Invasive nontyphoidal salmonella disease is a major and previously neglected tropical disease responsible for an estimated about 390 000 deaths per year in Africa, largely caused by a variant of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium called ST313. Despite the availability of more than 100 000 salmonella genomes, it has proven challenging to associate individual SNPs with pathogenic traits of this dangerous bacterium. Here, we used a transcriptomic strategy to identify a single-nucleotide change in a promoter region responsible for crucial phenotypic differences of African _S. Typhimurium_. Our findings show that a noncoding nucleotide of the bacterial genome can have a profound effect upon the pathogenesis of infectious disease."

Genetic analyses are gradually showing us that not only subtle SNP difference can make major upgrades in virulence but can also increase individuals to be much more susceptible to much severe disease from an individual pathogen. - Mod.LL]
