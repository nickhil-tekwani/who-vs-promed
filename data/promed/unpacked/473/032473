The situation in Borena zone with regard to animal health, food
security and water for human and animal consumption is deteriorating
on a daily basis. The extended dry season follows insufficient
rainfall during the hagaya rain (October-December), and conditions
have been exacerbated by overstocking of livestock and encroachment
of land by farms and bush trees.

According to Woreda officials in Arero, limited availability of water
for animals is contributing to poor health of livestock and reported
cases of livestock diseases, including anthrax, black leg, bloody
diarrhea, and FMD. The number of reported livestock deaths is
increasing on a daily basis. The Sub-Regional office WFP has
registered 4660 livestock deaths since mid-February 2008.

[The above description of the animal health situation in Ethiopia is
rather superficial and blurred. Obviously, poor nutritional
conditions seriously affect animal resistance to infectious as well
as non-infectious disease agents; increased animal movement and
nomadic wandering in search of feed and pasture have their own
deleterious effects, particularly related to infectious diseases. A
map of Ethiopia is included in the report.

The term "bloody diarrhea" is not specific; there are various
etiologies related to the appearance of hemorrhagic enteritis in
cattle and small ruminants, such as bacterial, parasitological (e.g.
helminths), protozoal, viral and nutritional-related.
Clostridia-related toxins may play their role as well. Rinderpest
should be excluded.

FMD is endemic in Ethiopia. According to the data of the World
reference laboratory for FMD at Pirbright, UK, the most recent FMDV
serotypes identified in Ethiopia were O (2007), C (1983), A (2007),
SAT2 (2007) and SAT1 (2007). For further details, including
sequencing results, subscribers are referred to

It will be of importance to obtain information on the presence or,
hopefully, absence of Rift Valley fever in the described region
(south Ethiopia). - Mod.AS]
