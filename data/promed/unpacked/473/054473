Identification of a rabid dog in France illegally introduced from Morocco
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction
------------
On 26 Feb 2008, the National Reference Centre for Rabies at the Institut
Pasteur in Paris, France, confirmed the diagnosis of rabies in a domestic
dog living in Grandpuits, Seine-et-Marne district, a suburb of Paris. The
dog was a 9 month old mixed-breed female, named Cracotte (pictures
available at
<http://www.invs.sante.fr/display/?doc=surveillance/rage/actu.htm>.)

It developed its 1st symptoms on 15 Feb 2008, had bitten its owner and one
neighbour and was euthanized on 19 Feb 2008. The viral strain was
identified by the National Reference Centre for Rabies as a strain
belonging to _Lyssavirus_ genotype 1, Africa 1 lineage, originating from
Morocco. According to its owner, Cracotte had never been outside France.
France has been declared officially rabies-free since 2001 [see comment].
An investigation was undertaken to identify the source of infection and
modes of transmission for Cracotte in order to identify potentially exposed
individuals and animals and to carry out an assessment of the risk of
rabies virus transmission in France.

Investigation
-------------
Origin of infection and chain of transmission
---------------------------------------------
The owners of Cracotte had a 2nd dog, a female black mixed-breed Labrador
named Youpee. Youpee was euthanized on 5 Jan 2008 after a brief illness. In
retrospective, its symptoms were compatible with rabies. Youpee had been in
contact with a dog named Gamin during a stay in the Gers district of
southern France in November 2007. Gamin was euthanized on 12 Nov 2007
because of an illness that, retrospectively, would be compatible with
rabies. Both Youpee and Gamin had been incinerated and had not been tested
for rabies. Gamin had been illegally introduced into France from Morocco,
and is the likely index dog that infected Youpee, that subsequently
infected Cracotte.

Areas and periods at risk
-------------------------
The probable index case Gamin and its 2 owners left Morocco by ferry on 20
Oct 2007 and reached France by car via Portugal and Spain. The owners
reported having spent 3 days in Portugal on a beach (precise location
unknown), then drove through Spain without stopping. They arrived in the
Hautes-Pyrenees district on 28 Oct 2007 and stayed there until 1 Nov 2007
with a friend in an industrial area that had no other inhabitants.
According to the owners and their host, Gamin was kept inside the car and
had no contact with persons except for their host, and no contact with
other animals, during these 3 days. The owners then drove to the Gers
district, where they stayed and where Gamin was euthanized on 12 Nov 2007.
Gamin and Youpee stayed together in the Gers district, where Youpee was
probably contaminated by Gamin. Youpee and its owner left the Gers district
for Seine-et-Marne by train on 29 Nov 2007. It stayed in Seine et Marne
until it was euthanized on 5 Jan 2008. Youpee and its owner traveled by
train outside the district for 3 days (15-17 Dec 2007) to Lisieux (Calvados
district, Normandy).

The at-risk period for transmission of rabies to humans or animals is
considered to begin from the 1st day of estimated viral excretion of the
dogs and to be ongoing (due to possible secondary animal cases). We assumed
that viral excretion started 15 days before the onset of symptoms of
illness. As of 13 March 2008, the geographical areas and periods at risk
are as follows:
- Montestruc-sur-Gers (Gers district) and surroundings, from 1 Nov 2007;
- Grandpuits (Seine-et-Marne district) and surroundings, from 15 Dec 2007;
- Lisieux (Calvados district) and surroundings, from 15 Dec 2007.

Control measures
----------------
An active tracing of people and animals in contact with the 3 dogs has been
carried out by health and veterinary authorities in the 3 districts. To
date, 177 people with close contacts with one of the 3 dogs have been
identified and referred to the rabies vaccination centres; 152 of them have
been vaccinated and several also received immunoglobulins. A national
rabies hotline has been implemented for the public at the Ministry of
Health (00.33/800.13.00.00). Local and national press releases have been
issued to relay the message that any individual who could have had a
potentially contaminating contact with one of the 3 dogs or with any other
dog in the at-risk area during the at-risk period should contact the
hotline. Pictures of the dog have been shown on television, in newspapers,
and on the Internet. Owners of dogs that might have been exposed to the
infected dogs have been advised to contact their district veterinary
services. As of 10 Mar 2008, no additional exposed individuals have been
identified among the 1071 people who have called the hotline. No human or
animal contact with the rabid dog Youpee has yet been identified among the
passengers during the trip by train of its owner (between Paris and Lisieux
cities on 15 and 17 Dec 2007).

Dogs and cats having been in contact with one of the 3 dogs have been
euthanized or placed under observation. To date, 7 dogs and a cat were
euthanized and all tested negative for rabies. Owners of dogs and cats in
the 3 districts have been recommended to keep their cats indoors, put their
dogs on leashes, and have their pets legally identified. The veterinary
services are maintaining a high level of vigilance.

The French hospital emergency medical services and general practitioners
were informed, via email, of the event and of the need for anti-rabies
prophylaxis for patients with any potentially contaminating contact with
one of the 3 dogs or any other unknown dog or cat, especially in the 3
districts involved. All rabies clinics were informed by the National
Reference Centre for Rabies. Moreover, pediatricians, intensive care
physicians, neurologists, and infectious disease experts have all been
informed by email in order to strengthen awareness and increase the
likelihood of early diagnosis in the event of a human case. To date, no
suspect human cases have been reported.

The last case of indigenous human rabies transmitted by a carnivore in
France occurred in 1924. Human cases of imported rabies are rare, with only
20 cases identified in France between 1970 and 2008 (90 per cent of them
from Africa). Since 2000, 9 imported cases have been reported in Western
Europe [1]. Two of them contracted their infection in Morocco [2,3]. In
France, rabies was endemic in foxes, especially along the German border in
eastern France, until the 1990s [4]. In 2001, after 30 years of extensive
control measures, including oral vaccination of foxes, and in the absence
of cases of rabies identified in terrestrial carnivores the World
Organisation for Animal Health [OIE] declared France free of rabies in
terrestrial animals [see comment]. Surveillance of rabies in carnivores has
been maintained in order to detect any re-introduction of the virus.

This event is not the 1st illegal introduction of a carnivore from a
rabies-endemic country into France [5,6]. In 2004, 3 cases of canine rabies
were diagnosed. All 3 dogs were illegally imported from Morocco and reached
France after having been transported through Spain by car. No secondary
transmission to humans or carnivores occurred during those events. The
sanitary regulations regarding rabies vaccination status of all carnivores
entering the European Union are essential for rabies control, and must be
strictly applied in European areas that have been declared rabies-free.
This applies to France in particular, as the illegal pet importation route
from Morocco through Spain to France has previously been reported.

Identification of a rabid dog in France illegally introduced from Morocco:
comment
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
As highlighted in the article above by a multidisciplinary investigation
team from France, there have been previous reports of dogs being illegally
introduced to France and subsequently identified with rabies infection. No
human cases related to these events have been identified to date. Although
exposure to rabies from animals in the European Union (EU) remains a rare
event, in the absence of post exposure prophylaxis before symptoms rabies
is invariably a deadly infection in humans. The French authorities have
implemented extensive measures, including the tracing of humans and animals
possibly in contact with the suspected rabid dogs, and awareness of the
event has been relayed to the general public through the media in order to
assist in identifying other possible human or animal contacts.

The index dog was reported to have been in Portugal for a few days while
travelling to France. Thus, information to the public has also been
published by the Portuguese health authorities on the website of the
Ministry of Health (<http://www.dgs.pt>). It cannot be excluded that other
EU citizens who have visited those particular geographical areas in France
or Portugal during these periods may have been bitten or scratched by the
index dog. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)
thus published a threat assessment of this event on its website
<http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/pdf/threat%20assessment%20080311_.pdf> to raise
awareness among clinicians for returning travellers from the at-risk areas
during the at-risk periods who may have been in contact with these dogs.

This event in animals also emphasises the importance of good communication
between animal and human health authorities, in each country and at the EU
level, in identifying and responding to any subsequent threat to human
health from animal health events.

[The intensive, thorough epidemiological investigation described in
Eurosurveillance is being posted by ProMED-mail to keep subscribers
informed about the course of the 3-stage event and on the discovered
exposures since end October 2007. This may be helpful in allowing the
tracing of additional, potentially missed contacts, within Portugal, Spain,
and France, and among individuals from other countries who may have shared
a part of the 3 dogs' routes.

Youpee and Cracotte, the 2 locally infected dogs, were most likely
unvaccinated -- vulnerable to infection, similarly to the entire canine and
feline population of France and other EU countries, where compulsory
vaccination was discontinued since the eradication of rabies. According to
a previous ProMED-mail posting (20080307.0938), Gamin was a mixed breed
collie and Youpee a black cross Labrador; the age(s) of both have not been
disclosed and, if available, will be interesting to note. The report does
not say whether they were seen by a veterinary practitioner prior to their
euthanasia. In a rabies-free country, practitioners -- and in particular
those who have never experienced clinical rabies, may miss a case,
particularly an atypical one. In view of the severity of this disease,
authorities may consider the dissemination of a reminder on the clinical
signs in pets and in domestic livestock and on the prescribed mode of
handling suspected cases, to practitioners and to others involved in the
(small and large) animals industry.

The statement "the World Organisation for Animal Health [Office
International des Epizooties; OIE] declared France free of rabies in
terrestrial animals," deserves a correction. Rabies is not included in the
list of 4 diseases (FMD [foot and mouth disease,] rinderpest, CBPP
[contagious bovine pleuropneumonia], and BSE [bovine spongiform
encephalopathy]) allowing an official OIE declaration of freedom. The
declaration of France as rabies-free in 1998 was a "self-declaration", not
an official OIE declaration. - Mod.AS]
