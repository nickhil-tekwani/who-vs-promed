Elk with chronic wasting disease found in South Dakota park
-------------------------------
Officials say lab tests have confirmed that a 5-year-old elk in Wind Cave
National Park had chronic wasting disease (CWD), a contagious, fatal brain
disease that has shown up rarely in the state.

Staff at the park recently saw the elk showing symptoms, said Linda L.
Stoll, Wind Cave superintendent. The animal was killed and brain tissue
samples were analyzed at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colo.

It was the second case of CWD in a free-ranging big-game animal in South
Dakota. A deer shot by a hunter near Oral last year tested positive for the
disease. State game officials have continued testing deer and elk.

Last summer an elk in a private herd near Fairburn died of CWD. Beginning
in 1997, 6 captive elk herds, including some in the Black Hills area,
became infected. One of those herds was next to Wind Cave National Park's
southern boundary. It's not known where the park elk became infected. But
the Wind Cave elk was believed to be part of the Gobbler Knob sub-herd in
the southern part of the park.

Officials at Wind Cave National Park are consulting with national and state
wildlife experts, according to a release.

There's no scientific evidence that the disease can be transmitted to
humans - or to animals other than deer and elk.

Lab tests are needed for a diagnosis because many big-game diseases affect
animals in similar ways, the state Game, Fish and Parks Department says.

Last summer, Wind Cave got $279 000 to study deer movement patterns and
density levels and to test for chronic wasting disease. The study is
scheduled to begin in February 2003.
'
"We are concerned about the threat this disease poses to area deer and elk
herds, and we'll be coordinating with the state of South Dakota to use our
upcoming study to learn more about the occurrence of this disease,'' Stoll
said.
