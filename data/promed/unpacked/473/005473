Russia: hepatitis A outbreak in Buryatiya
-----------------------------------------
The number of cases of hepatitis A virus infection in the Republic of
Buryatiya has risen to 100, according to the Emergency Situations Ministry.
14 new cases have been identified in the past 24 hours. An emergency
situation has been declared in the Barguzinskiy region of Buryatiya. This
region appears to be the focus of the outbreak. All schools, kindergartens,
and nurseries have been closed.
The regional health administration has established a special unit to tackle
the emergency, but as yet the spread of infection, which appears to be by
personal contact, has not yet been contained. According to additional
sources, 54 children are currently in hospital with hepatitis A. The source
of the epidemic has not been established.

[The Republic of Buryatiya is located in the south central region of
Siberia along the eastern shore of Lake Baikal. The current outbreak does
not appear to be related to the hepatitis A outbreak in Buryatiya in
January of this year, which involved children in a sanatorium in Ulan Ude,
the capital city of the Republic. Recent outbreaks of hepatitis A infection
have occurred throughout Russia, mostly as a consequence of poor
maintenance of water and sewage services. In the present case, the source
of infection has not been identified, and it is believed that the infection
is transmitted from person to person, rather than by water. Further
information on the investigation of the outbreak and possible use of
vaccination in its control would be welcomed. - Mods.NR/CP]
