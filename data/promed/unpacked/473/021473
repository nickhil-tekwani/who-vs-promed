Basal rot, a disease caused by fungi and bacteria, took a toll on shallot crops in Perambalur district. This [2022] is the 3rd consecutive year of the disease affecting yield. Shallot was grown on more than 2000 hectares in the district in 2022.

Farmers say recent heavy rains led to the infection. They say that the fungal attack is a usual phenomenon every rainy season. In some areas, crops get completely destroyed by the disease. Farmers are calling on authorities to come up with a solution since they are running out of seed onions.

The Department of Horticulture in the district said that farmers, in order to prevent the disease, need to practice crop rotation. They said that they have been raising awareness among farmers about this method.

[A number of fungi can affect onion (_Allium cepa_; some varieties known as shallots) and related crops such as garlic (_A. sativum_) to cause root and basal rots. The term 'basal rot' is mostly used for species of _Fusarium_. Species of _Phoma_, _Pythium_, _Rhizoctonia_, as well as some nematodes have also been reported to be associated with root rot symptoms. There are also several bacteria causing root rots in the crop, including species of _Pseudomonas_, _Dickeya_, and _Pantoea_.

Root rot diseases are usually soilborne and also spread with infected plant and other materials, including agricultural implements. They are generally favoured by wet conditions and are difficult to control. Disease management may include deep plowing, phytosanitation, and crop rotations of several years. For fungal rots, appropriate fungicide regimes may be helpful, but agrochemicals are often of limited use for soil-borne pathogens.

While a possible contribution of both fungi and bacteria to the rotting problems is mentioned above, specific identification of any pathogens involved does not seem to have been carried out.
