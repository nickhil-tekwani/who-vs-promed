A total of 7 cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) have
been recorded in the Stavropol region [Kray]: One case in each of the
Petrokumsky, Ipatovsky and Turkmen districts and 2 cases in each of
the Apanasenkovsky and Arzgirsky districts. Cases of CCHF have been
contracted as a consequence of tick bites experienced during contact
with cattle, sheep shearing, herding of animals, and by removal of
ticks using unprotected hands. One case of CCHF was contracted as the
result of a tick bite suffered during a recreational excursion.

In comparison with the previous week, the number of reports of tick
bites has risen by 38.8 percent. In total 2081 people, including 762
children, have sought treatment for tick bites and 47 persons have
been hospitalised on suspicion of infection.

With the onset of warm weather, conditions are favourable for an
increase in activity of _Ixodes_ ticks and there will be a marked
increase in their interactions with animals and the human population.
The health agency Rospotrebnadzor is stressing the need to implement
measures to avoid the spread of CCHF.

[The 1st CCHF cases were reported 2 weeks ago. In 2008 there were 80
cases of CCHF in the Stavropol region, and 6 fatalities. - Corr.BA

The Stavropol Region is one of Russia's best agricultural regions. It
is located north of the Caucasus mountains and stretches from the
Krasnodar region on the west almost to the Caspian Sea. A map of the
Stavropol Region [Stavroposkii Krai] is available at:
