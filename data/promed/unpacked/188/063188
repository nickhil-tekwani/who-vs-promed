[Los Santos province is endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Last year (2014), the province had 75 reported hantavirus infections. Although not specified in the report above or the previous ones, the hantavirus most likely involved is Choclo virus, since it is the only hantavirus known to cause HPS with hospitalizations in Panama. The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents occur in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings. The health authorities' call for residents to maintain cleanliness in their houses and surrounding areas is to avoid attracting these rodents.
