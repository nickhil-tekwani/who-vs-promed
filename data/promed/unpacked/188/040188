Subject: Anthrax in Minnesota continues

Still having new cases of anthrax in Northern MN. 4th case was in Marshall
County about 40 miles South of the first Greenbush case. As of Saturday [2
Sep 2000 when I was at the farm, there were 3 dead cows. [The rest of the
herd was removed from pasture and vaccinated.
My guess is that the source was a site through a lowland area. The producer
used a field cultivator to remove ruts in a field path and disturbed the
soil????
Fifth case appears to be just South of the Canadian border about 6 miles
east of the RG case. 5 acute deaths but as yet no lab confirmation.

6 members of a farm family in Roseau County were treated after eating meat
from a cow that had anthrax, health officials said Thursday [7 Sep 2000.
Only 2 of them, a teenager and an adult, developed symptoms of a possible
anthrax stomach infection in late Aug 20000, but both recovered spontaneously.
Anthrax usually infects the skin, but can affect the digestive track and
respiratory system. The case of the farm family came to light 25 Aug 2000
after one of its cows collapsed and died. A veterinarian from the state
Board of Animal Health discovered that it had been infected with anthrax
and notified the state Department of Health. At that point, the farmer
disclosed that another of his cows had "gone down" on 24 Jul 2000. When
family members couldn't get the cow [to stand up with a loader, they
called their veterinarian, who told them the meat would be safe to eat. The
family killed the animal and took the carcass to the local locker plant,
where it was processed. The family then ate steaks and hamburgers from the
cow between 15 Aug 2000 and 20 Aug 2000.
Said Danila: "When we heard that, we said, 'Gee, based on that, maybe that
[one had anthrax too. Don't eat any more. Go to a doctor and get
treated.'" The Health Department tested the meat and found that "it was
loaded with anthrax," he said. Health Department officials then checked the
locker plant, which only processes meat for personal use. "It's a very
clean facility," Danila said. "They clean and disinfect between each
carcass." Regulators don't inspect meat in such cases because it was for
the family's own use. The health department said the general public isn't
at risk because animals processed for commercial sale are inspected. [vide

"There's never been a case of gastrointestinal anthrax reported in the
United States," said Richard Danila, assistant state epidemiologist. "This
was a very unique [unusual, not unique ... MHJ set of circumstances that
happened whereby a family of 6 consumed meat found to be heavily
contaminated with anthrax." [There have been some "near-misses" in recent
years; for example an anthrax-infected goat was taken from a Texas farmer's
domestic deep freeze last year. I fully expect there have been others not
recovered. MHJ
In humans, [gastrointestinal anthrax can cause diarrhea, abdominal pain
and fever within 2 to 5 days, Danila said. In the Roseau case, one person
developed all 3 symptoms, and the second reported mild diarrhea within days
of eating the meat. Both recovered on their own, before the anthrax [cases
was [were detected. The family members were put on antibiotics to prevent
any remaining anthrax bacteria from growing and releasing toxins. At the
same time, officials worried that anthrax spores might lodge in the lymph
nodes and turn deadly after the antibiotics stopped. So they requested the
anthrax vaccine from the U.S. military's bioterrorism section to prevent
future illness. The family received the first of 3 doses last week, Danila
said, and will get the rest during the next 4 weeks.
Health officials have sent blood samples from the farm family and 24 others
including butchers and other people who had cattle processed at a local
meat locker after the infected carcass to the Army Medical Research
Institute of Infectious Diseases in Maryland to be tested for anthrax
exposure. "We don't know if they actually got it," Danila said. "We know
that they were ill, and those symptoms are compatible with gastrointestinal
anthrax." He also noted that the family said the meat was well cooked,
which can kill the bacteria. If confirmed, these would be the first known
cases of gastrointestinal anthrax in the United States, said Richard Danila.
Health officials did not disclose the name of the slaughterhouse involved,
saying there is no risk of further infection. "I was there myself, it was
very, very clean," said Danila. He said the plant took extra precautions
and shut down for a thorough cleaning after the incident came to light. As
a precaution, health officials also recommended antibiotics for about 60
other people who ate meat from the first animal that was slaughtered after
the infected cow. [A more informed source has 80 people on antibiotics. MHJ
The Board of Animal Health has received reports of confirmed or suspected
anthrax cases in 8 cattle herds in Clay, Becker, Roseau, Marshall,
Pennington and Traverse counties. Officials say they are the first anthrax
cases reported in the region since Minnesota started keeping records in
1909. They could not offer an explanation for the prevalence of anthrax in
northern Minnesota at this time.
As a precaution, the board is recommending vaccinations for cattle herds on
farms that have had an anthrax case, as well as on neighboring farms. It is
also warning area livestock producers to assume that dead cattle are
infected with anthrax, unless proven otherwise.
