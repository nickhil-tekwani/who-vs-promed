Plans for a Tonsil Archive
--------------------------
A paper published in the British Medical Journal has provided new
information on the prevalence of preclinical variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease [abbreviated as vCJD of CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail] in the
United Kingdom (UK) (1,2). A distinctive feature of vCJD is the widespread
distribution of an abnormal prion protein in peripheral lymphoid tissue
(3,4), which may be detectable before any symptoms develop (5).
The authors looked retrospectively for the presence of abnormal prion
protein in 8318 appendectomy and tonsillectomy samples and found one
positive appendix. It is not known whether an asymptomatic person with
detectable abnormal prion protein will go on to develop vCJD but, as
discussed in the paper, 19 of 20 appendixes removed at autopsy from
patients with vCJD have shown accumulation of abnormal prion protein, as
did the appendixes removed from 2 patients prior to disease onset (5).
Whilst the paper does report the first estimate of the prevalence of
abnormal prion protein based on population testing, larger studies are
needed to provide a more precise estimate.
In conjunction with the publication of the paper, the Chief Medical Officer
for England, Sir Liam Donaldson, announced plans to establish a prospective
archive of tonsils, which will be used to provide improved estimates of the
prevalence of preclinical vCJD (6). Large prospective studies of tonsil
tissue are thought to offer the best opportunity for estimating the
prevalence of preclinical vCJD. Outside of the central nervous system,
tonsil tissue is the best tissue for the detection of the abnormal prion
protein in vCJD (3), and unfixed tissue specimens allow efficient testing.
The Public Health Laboratory Service in London has been asked to coordinate
the development of the tonsil archive and will be working with England's
Department of Health, ear, nose, and throat surgeons and pathologists to
achieve this goal.
The archive will be established on an unlinked anonymous basis, which means
that each specimen will have personal identifying information irreversibly
removed before testing and there will be no way of linking individual
tonsil or test results back to the patient from whom they came. This is the
same principle that has been used since 1990 to provide crucial, and
otherwise unavailable information on the prevalence of HIV and other
blood-borne virus infection in the UK (7,8).
