In response to your request for information, as you reported, a case of BSE was announced by the Welsh Government Deputy Minister for farming and food. This case was confirmed by the UK's TSE reference laboratory as classical BSE and was born in 2009. Given the relatively recent date of birth, an epidemiological investigation is underway.

Control measures, as required by the EU TSE Regulation, include tracing and culling of all relevant cohorts and offspring, and this process is underway. Traced animals still alive are officially restricted and prevented from entering the food chain, based on the precautionary principle.

[In the previous posting on BSE in Wales, we requested official confirmation and the age of the affected animal. ProMED-mail is very grateful to the Welsh veterinary authorities for their immediate response to our RFI.

The results of the epidemiological investigation are anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS
