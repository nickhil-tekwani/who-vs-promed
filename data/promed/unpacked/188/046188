The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an import alert
regarding entry of cantaloupe from Agropecuaria Montelibano, a
Honduran grower and packer, because, based on current information,
fruit from this company appears to be associated with a _Salmonella
[enterica_ serotype] Litchfield outbreak in the USA and Canada. The
import alert advises FDA field offices that all cantaloupes shipped
to the United States by this company are to be detained.

In addition, the FDA has contacted importers about this action and is
advising USA grocers, food service operators, and produce processors
to remove from their stock any cantaloupes from this company. The FDA
also advises consumers who have recently bought cantaloupes to check
with the place of purchase to determine if the fruit came from this
specific grower and packer. If so, consumers should throw away the
cantaloupes.

To date, the FDA has received reports of 50 illnesses in 16 states
and 9 illnesses in Canada linked to the consumption of cantaloupes.
No deaths have been reported; however, 14 people have been
hospitalized. The [US] states are Arizona, California, Colorado,
Georgia, Illinois, Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio,
Oklahoma, Oregon, Tennessee, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin.

The FDA is taking this preventive measure while the agency continues
to investigate this outbreak in cooperation with the CDC (US Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention) and state partners. Such
intervention is a key component of FDA's Food Protection Plan.

The FDA recommends that consumers take the following steps to reduce
the risk of contracting _Salmonella_ or other foodborne illnesses
from cantaloupes:

- purchase cantaloupes that are not bruised or damaged. If buying
fresh-cut cantaloupe, be sure it is refrigerated or surrounded by ice.
- after purchase, refrigerate cantaloupes promptly.
- wash hands with hot, soapy water before and after handling fresh
cantaloupes.
- scrub whole cantaloupes by using a clean produce brush and cool tap
water immediately before eating. Don't use soap or detergents.
- use clean cutting surfaces and utensils when cutting cantaloupes.
Wash cutting boards, countertops, dishes, and utensils with hot water
and soap between the preparation of raw meat, poultry, or seafood and
the preparation of cantaloupe.
- if there happens to be a bruised or damaged area on a cantaloupe,
cut away those parts before eating it.
- leftover cut cantaloupe should be discarded if left at room
temperature for more than 2 hours.
- use a cooler with ice or use ice gel packs when transporting or
storing cantaloupes outdoors.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has confirmed Honduran grown
cantaloupes are being voluntarily recalled after a continent-wide
salmonella outbreak.

The recall followed a warning earlier Saturday [22 Mar 2008] from the
USA FDA about the outbreak, which CFIA (Canadian Food Inspection
Agency) said has sickened 9 people in 5 provinces and 50 people in 16
USA states.

"We've been investigating this for a while now," agency spokesman
Garfield Balsom told The Canadian Press Saturday night [22 Mar 2008].
"There's been some co-operation between USA officials and Canadian
officials in trying to identify any commonalities regarding this
salmonella. But unfortunately up until yesterday [21 Mar 2008] with
regard to the traceback, there's been nothing identified."

The affected melons (from Agropecuaria Montelibano) were distributed
in Canada by Federated Co-Op in all western provinces, the 3
territories, and northwestern Ontario, and Canada Safeway stores in
BC (British Columbia) only.

The Canadian illnesses occurred between 19 Jan 2008 and 22 Feb 2008
and are reported in BC, Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, and New Brunswick.

Balsom said the type of bacteria involved in the cantaloupes case is
_S. [enterica_ serotype] Litchfield, although officials haven't been
able to prove conclusively that this is what caused the illnesses.

"There have been no reported illnesses that we've identified
associated with this particular strain of salmonella. However,
illnesses take a while to get through the system and get typed."

He notes that while no cases have cropped up in Canada later than 22
Feb 2008, there have been cases reported after that date in the USA.

There have been no extreme cases of illness among the 9 reported in
Canada, Balsom stressed. He said people become infected by simply
handling the outside of the fruit. "Because the surface of the
product is contaminated, that is transferred to the consumer
unfortunately," he said.

The CFIA investigation is continuing, Balsom stated, adding it's
possible other distributors or retailers may have received
cantaloupes from the growers, and other new cases of illness could
arise.

[Even if the rind of the melon is not handled, cutting into the melon
will introduce the pathogen into the edible part. The imported melons
are likely to have been contaminated in the field from contaminated
irrigation water. ProMED-mail Rapporteur submitted a similar posting.
