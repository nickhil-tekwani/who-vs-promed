Vegetable farmers in Kole district have failed to control the pests and diseases that have invaded their vegetable gardens. One of the pests has been identified as the glow worm which eats up all the leaves.

There is also a disease that affects tomatoes, which they say kills the plant as soon as it attacks. One of the affected farmers explains that a plant that has been attacked by the disease wilts and eventually drops off.

Geoffrey Otim, Integrated Seed Sector Development (ISSD), explained that farmers lack [extension] services. He identified [the tomato disease] as bacterial wilt which destroys all the plants in a short while. Control measures should [be taken] including planting disease free materials, other practices such as crop rotation and seeking advice from qualified people in case of a problem on the farm.

[Bacterial wilt (BW; also called southern BW) caused by _Ralstonia solanacearum_ (previously _Pseudomonas s._) is one of the major diseases of tomato and other solanaceous crops. It is most severe in tropical and subtropical areas with high rainfall and warm temperatures. Symptoms on tomato include wilting of the youngest leaves which may recover temporarily during cooler evenings; eventually the whole plant wilts permanently, roots and lower portion of the stem develop browning of the vascular system; invaded roots may rot and plants may die.

The bacteria are spread by mechanical means (including insects), contaminated equipment, infected plant material, soil, and water. They can survive in soil on plant debris or roots of hosts. Some solanaceous weeds and volunteer crop plants may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management is difficult, relying mostly on exclusion from new areas and use of certified clean tomato explants for planting. Some cultural methods (such as crop rotation), control of pathogen reservoirs and phytosanitary measures may be used. Grafting susceptible tomato varieties onto rootstocks of resistant aubergine lines is widely practiced in some Asian countries. Tomato varieties with some genetic resistance/tolerance exist, but due to the different strains of the pathogen may not be suitable for all regions. Therefore, breeding programmes to develop resistant tomato varieties suitable for local conditions are needed.

_R. solanacearum_ affects more than 200 plant species including many important crops (for example, causing brown rot of potato). It has been classified into various races and biovars active under different climatic conditions and in different hosts.
