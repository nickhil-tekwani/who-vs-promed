The number of confirmed cases of salmonella in a central Missouri region has reached 36 according the Cole County Health Department.

Kristi Campbell, the department's director, said 14 of those that contracted the infection ate at the same restaurant and that the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services is working with the Jefferson City Environmental Health Division to investigate that establishment.

'The way it works is information is reported to the County Health Department from patients or their caregiver," said David Grellner with the Jefferson City Environmental Health Division. "The Communicable Disease Office at the County confirms this information and interviews the patients who reported ill to get a history to see if they can pinpoint a source."

Campbell also said that all of the confirmed cases of salmonellosis had the same pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern, indicating that the infection came from the same or a similar source, in this case, eggs or chicken. The name of the restaurant at which 14 of the infected ate is not being released by the Cole County Health Department.
