University of California Irvine (UCI) researchers have combined
genetic and geographic data of the H5N1 avian flu virus to
reconstruct its history over the past decade. They found that
multiple strains of the virus originated in the Chinese province of
Guangdong, and they identified many of the migration routes through
which the strains spread regionally and internationally.
By knowing where H5N1 strains develop and migrate, health officials
can better limit the spread of the virus by strategically
intervening. Local vaccinations can be better administered by using
strains from regions that have repeatedly contributed to infections.
"If you can control the virus at its source, you can control it more
efficiently," said Walter Fitch, Professor of Ecology and
Evolutionary Biology in the School of Biological Sciences at UCI and
co-author of the study. "With a road map of where the strain has
migrated, you're more likely to isolate the strain that you should be
using to make the vaccine."
The study will appear this week in the online early edition of the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [see details and
Abstract of the paper below]. This research offers the 1st
statistical analysis detailing the geographic distribution of
influenza A H5N1, the bird flu strain. While previous work informally
identified H5N1 strains by location, the UCI analysis is the 1st to
systematically track the migration of H5N1 through its evolutionary
history, adding new details that identify the relative importance of
the geographic and evolutionary advances the virus makes. From 192
samples obtained across Eurasia, the UCI team reconstructed the
virus's geographic reach and evolution. The analysis shows that
Guangdong -- home to a large poultry industry -- is the source of
many H5N1 strains that have spread to other provinces and countries.
To the south in nearby Indochina, the strains appear largely limited
to dispersal among local areas.
Genetic sequences the scientists analyzed suggest that parallel
evolution of different H5N1 strains lets the virus infect and cycle
through different host species in a region, regardless of the host or
vector species it infects first. This way, the virus can find the
right host to spread the infection to the next location. This
parallel evolution -- the independent evolution of similar traits --
enables H5N1 to spread quickly, the scientists believe. "The ability
to develop the right mutation allows the virus to hop from one host
type to the next," said Robert Wallace, UCI postdoctoral researcher
and lead author of the study. "By spreading across a large area, the
virus in essence can run multiple experiments in multiple locations,
increasing the likelihood that it will mutate into a form that can be
transmitted from human to human."
Avian flu has been isolated almost exclusively among bird
populations. The H5N1 virus has only sporadically been passed on from
a bird host to humans; there is little evidence that the virus can
efficiently be passed on from human to human. Although fewer than 300
recorded human cases of this flu have been reported worldwide, its
high mortality rate raises concerns that if the virus mutates to
where humans can pass it on, a flu pandemic may occur.

The paper referred to in the preceding report appears in the online
edition of PNAS [13 Mar 2007] and is entitled "A statistical
phylogeography of influenza A H5N1". The authors are Robert G.
Wallace, HoangMinh HoDac, Richard H. Lathrop, and Walter M. Fitch; at
the University of California, Irvine.
The Abstract reads as follows: "The geographic diffusion of highly
pathogenic influenza A H5N1 has largely been traced from the
perspective of the virus's victims. Birds of a variety of avian
orders have been sampled across localities, and their infection has
been identified by a general genetic test. Another approach tracks
the migration from the perspective of the virus alone, by way of a
phylogeography of H5N1 genetic sequences. Although several
phylogenies in the literature have labeled H5N1 clades by geographic
region, none has analytically inferred the history of the virus's
migration. With a statistical phylogeography of 192 hemagglutinin and
neuraminidase isolates, we show that the Chinese province of
Guangdong is the source of multiple H5N1 strains spreading at both
regional and international scales. In contrast, Indochina appears to
be a regional sink, at the same time demonstrating bidirectional
dispersal among localities within the region. An evolutionary trace
of HA1 across the phylogeography suggests a mechanism by which H5N1
is able to infect repeated cycles of host species across localities,
regardless of the host species first infected in each locale. The
trace also hypothesizes amino acid replacements that preceded the 1st
recorded outbreak of pathogenic H5N1 in Hong Kong, 1997."

[This analysis by Wallace et al. starts from the position that
genetic phylogenies are the 'gold standard' for defining viral
genealogy, transmission, and molecular evolution. The authors
describe a unique form of analysis of H5N1 genomic (HA and N)
sequence data using a modification of a methodology developed by
others for following migratory events through an interspecific
phylogeny, with their own added statistical evaluation. The
localities from which the sequences are sampled are assigned as a
single character to the tips of the resulting tree. From such an
analysis the authors can infer migration patterns for H5N1
phylogenies for 192 HA and N sequences sampled from 20 localities in
Eurasia. The migration events (illustrated by striking graphics)
inferred across the parsimony genetic phylogenies for HA and N,
singly and together, showed the Chinese province of Guangdong acted
as a geographic source for multiple H5N1 variants.
The province of Guangdong appears as the prime source of H5N1's
diversity and diffusion, seeding multiple migration events. The
authors note that Guangdong, together with much of southern China,
hosts a combination of circumstances that apparently favour H5N1
diversification and spread. These include explosive growth in the
production of factory farmed poultry and free-range ducks; extensive
use of vaccines on industrial _Galloanserae_; an expanding interface
between wildfowl and domestic birds brought about by reduced wetlands
and a newfound wildfowl penchant for human agriculture; and, with
Hong Kong's reintegration into China, greater access to international
trade. The phylogeographies also captured H5N1's general thrust west
into Europe.
The fundamental advantage of a phylogeographic approach is that it
offers the capacity to identify, and test the significance of,
specific pathways of dispersal across a variety of geographic scales.
China's influenza epidemiology, as with those of other countries,
appeared defined by a hierarchy of diffusion potentials. From
Guangdong, H5N1 spreads to a variety of international destinations,
including Japan, Vietnam, and Indonesia, as well as to regional
localities within China. Guangxi's migratory targets, on the other
hand, were more spatially localized. Indochina, as represented here
by Thailand and Vietnam, appeared largely isolated in its own endemic
disease ecosystem cut of from the rest of Asia.
There are a few discordant features not accounted for in the analysis
as it stands. For example, the analysis does not include
consideration of the recently emergent Fujian-like sublineage in
Asia, nor recent incursions into Indonesia and Western Europe. Also
an H5N1 Qinghai-like sub-lineage jumped directly from Qinghai to
Astrakhan, near the Caspian Sea. Neither migration by wildfowl nor
the poultry trade are likely to account for such a jump. This
situation may have arisen from the limited sample sizes for the more
western localities included in the study.
The authors develop the concept that these phylogeographies represent
an evolution of H5N1 transmissibility and parallel evolution to
successful viral phenotypes. They suggest that influenza virus may
have long practiced such an epidemiology in its Arctic habitat.
Influenza strains adaptively rotate among host reservoirs as
different species of migratory birds move on and off the tundra
during the breeding season. By cycling "molecular dialects", a more
southern H5N1 may be able to circumvent the patches of antibody and
cytotoxic lymphocyte memory that host populations sustain.
Perhaps the most important product of this analysis is the
identification of Guangdong province as the principal target for
disease control measures. - Mod.CP]
