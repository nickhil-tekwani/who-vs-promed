Fatal horse infection making comeback
-------------------------------------
More than 50 horses have died statewide this year [2008] from the
worst outbreak in recent summers of an infection caught from mosquito
bites. No people have gotten the illness, but the state confirmed 56
cases of Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in horses as of early July
2008. Animals from Orange, Volusia, Lake, Osceola and Polk counties
were among the victims. For comparison, there were 18 cases in horses
during all of 2007, and 17 in 2006.

"This infection is almost always fatal," said Dr. Michael Short, a
veterinarian and equine program manager with the Florida Department
of Agriculture and Consumer Services. "These horses get very sick,
very fast. It's horrible to see."

The condition is caused by the Eastern equine encephalitis virus,
which can be carried by mosquitoes and passed to people or animals
through bites. EEE always exists at some level in Florida's abundant
insect population, but it tends to peak in July and August.

At its worst, the virus can lead to a brain infection called
encephalitis. Florida hasn't had a human case of Eastern equine
encephalitis since 2005, and it has been pretty infrequent for
horses, too. In a bad year, more than 200 horses have gotten sick.
But the animals have an advantage over people: They can be vaccinated.

In normal circumstances, horses should be immunized for Eastern
equine every 6 months, said Dr. Erin Denney-Jones, a Lake County
veterinarian. But during an outbreak such as Florida is experiencing,
vets recommend a shot every 4 months.

The vaccine doesn't give complete protection -- some horses still get
sick. But it cuts the chances significantly. Short said the "vast
majority" of this year's cases have occurred in animals that were not
up-to-date on their immunizations.

The economy may be contributing to the outbreak. Eastern equine
vaccines are relatively inexpensive, running about USD 7 a shot if
ordered directly from a supplier, Short said. But it's illegal in
Florida for anyone other than a veterinarian to give the shots, and
people may not have the cash to pay for a veterinarian visit.

"We send out reminders when it's time for vaccinations," Denney-Jones
said, "and we're definitely not getting as many people responding" this year.

[This is a preventable disease and vaccination is cheap and easy
compared to the death of a horse. When an animal is vaccinated for
West Nile Virus it can be vaccinated for Eastern and Western equine
encephalitis at the same time. - Mod.TG

Although there is an approved vaccine for horses, there isn't one
available for human use. People living in areas where horses are
dying of EEE would be well advised to take anti-mosquito precautions,
which would protect them against West Nile virus also. - Mod.JW]
