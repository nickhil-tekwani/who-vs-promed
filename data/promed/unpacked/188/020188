Dozens of sea star are dying in the Oregon Coast because of the mysterious disease that has previously killed these animals in Puget Sound [Washington state]. Divers with the Oregon Coast Aquarium found that 48 sea stars were either dead or dying in a 60-sq-mi [155.4 sq-km] area in Yaquina Bay on Oregon's central coast during a survey last week [28 Apr-4 May 2014].

The clinical signs of the disease have been witnessed in sunflower stars, ochre stars, and giant pink stars. The disease leads to physical deterioration and eventually causes death. Some of the sea stars experience arms break off from their body and walk away before they get dissolved completely. "They found, basically dead, melting animals. Their arms were curling up, they had signs of lesions or arms had detached and walked away from the bodies completely", said Erin Paxton, a spokeswoman for the Oregon Coast Aquarium.

Scientists believe the disease is caused by some bacteria or virus which is spreading fast. However, there is uncertainty over this theory as well. There were few reported cases in Oregon until last week [28 Apr-4 May 2014], said Paxton. Divers had been conducting surveys since January [2014], but did not find any evidence of affliction on sea stars until last week.

Now, divers will conduct additional surveys this week and next one [5-18 May 2014]. Paxton said that that they found sea stars falling victim of the disease, but it has not been ascertained yet how widespread it is. It is a big reason to worry as sea stars are considered a keystone species in the Oregon rocky reef ecosystem. If the species dies in more numbers, the entire food chain for the marine food web will experience adverse alterations.

Wasting disease has not been witnessed for the 1st time, but what makes it different this time is the fact that it has affected 12 different species unlike previously, when it typically attacked only one species.

[Mass mortalities of echinoids (sea stars) as a result of disease have been widely reported from all over the world. Wasting disease has been observed in sea stars in the west coast of USA periodically during warm water years since it was first recognized in 1978 and was especially prevalent during the 1982-1984 El Nino.

The marine environment is showing alarming signs of poor ecosystem health in several parts of the world. Coral reefs worldwide are threatened by increasing anthropogenic stressors, particularly overfishing and the problems associated with global climate change. These diseases may not be caused by a single culprit (such as a pathogen brought in by a ship), and it is likely that they have multiple interacting causes.

Anything that causes a severe disruption of the natural processes that govern an ecosystem has the potential to alter the dynamics of health of its animal community. However, the determinants of an alleged ecosystem health problem behind this unusual mortality event would be very difficult to elucidate. An integration of perspectives of different scale (that is, local, regional, global; and placing the focus at different levels, from the individual to the whole ecosystem) might prove important to understand these abnormal episodes.
