Laboratory analysis at the Olt County Public Health Department [Romania] has confirmed a case of infection with anthrax. Disease was confirmed in the 60-year-old man admitted to hospital on [5 Aug 2014] in Caracal.

"The initial results of laboratory analyses issued by the Olt County Public Health Department report that bacterial culture has been developed which has the characteristics of the anthrax bacillus. It is a 1st step towards a positive diagnosis. We are waiting for test results from the Cantacuzino Institute of Bucharest. From the clinical point of view it is anthrax. It should be noted that the condition of the patient is good. He has responded very well to treatment with penicillin," declared Mihnea Tuta, medical director of the Municipal Hospital of Caracal.

Another man, 65, who arrived on [8 Aug 2014] at Caracal Hospital, was showing signs of infection with anthrax. The 2 had slaughtered a sick goat. Sanitary-Veterinary Service investigation is in progress.

On the other hand, a woman in Olt County who was admitted to hospital in Pitesti was also suspected to have anthrax. She became sick after coming into contact with the carcass of a goat that died from the flooding. "The patient, aged 50 years, is under surveillance. From the clinical point of view it is anthrax, but it is a mild form that can be treated with antibiotics," declared Camelia Constantin, MD Infectious Diseases in the SJU Pitesti.

Specimens were collected from all these patients and were sent for analysis at the Cantacuzino Institute in Bucharest; test results are expected in coming days.
