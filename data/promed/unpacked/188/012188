According to Seagoville Animal Services, 2 raccoons were recently captured in Seagoville [Dallas County, Texas] and tested positive for distemper.

The Seagoville Animal Services sent out a Public Awareness Notice on 11 Mar 2017, and advised area residents to check their pet(s) vaccination records to be sure they are up to date for protection against distemper -- a potentially fatal viral disease and the leading cause of infectious disease deaths in dogs.

The disease is easily spread by direct contact with fresh urine, blood, or saliva, according to WebMD.

"[Symptoms] include sneezing, coughing, and thick mucus coming from the eyes and nose," states WebMD. "Fever, lethargy, sudden vomiting and diarrhea, depression, and/or loss of appetite are also symptoms of the virus."

If you suspect your dog has been infected, immediately see your local veterinarian as the virus spreads quickly and must be aggressively treated.

Anyone who sees a raccoon exhibit these symptoms should call the Seagoville Animal Services at (972) 287-6838.

[Canine distemper virus is the pathogen most frequently causing outbreaks at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface. As distemper and rabies affect the central nervous system, they both cause behavior disorders. Distemper usually results in stumbling and lack of 'shyness', they can seem 'dumb' and/or 'friendly'. Same, issue also can result with rabies. Animals showing the same signs might be rabid. In North Carolina, terrestrial rabies is mainly maintained by raccoons. It is very important to make sure to keep the vaccination schemes of all dogs, cats, and ferrets in the area up to date.

While canine distemper is relatively common in raccoons, they are also very susceptible to feline distemper, more commonly known as feline panleukopenia virus (FPV).

If the virus is circulating in the area, then protection of your pets is critical. While your pet dog may survive distemper, it will take some serious medical help and likely a large veterinary bill. It is much easier, safer and more economically feasible to vaccinate your pet. So please be sure both your cats and dogs are up-t-date on their vaccines. - Mod.PMB/TG
