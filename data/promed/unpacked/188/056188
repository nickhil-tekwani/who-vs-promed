Media news articles from 11-12 May 2021 stated that Oman's Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources (MAFWR) has urged citizens and residents to follow preventive guidelines to protect against Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever [CCHF] by avoiding tick bites when dealing with animals, both when buying and selling them.

The report, carried by a leading Arabic news site, quoted Dr Khaled bin Muslim al Sulaymani, a veterinarian at the Department of Animal Health, as saying that CCHF is a dangerous viral disease that affects humans, causing fever and severe disease symptoms that may even be fatal. He added that the disease is transmitted to humans through tick bites or direct contact with the blood or tissues of infected animals during or immediately after slaughter.

The disease also affects various animals such as sheep, goats, cows, and camels via insects.

He emphasized that the ministry continues to coordinate with the competent authorities in educating the public about this disease. He said that the ministry seeks to control the disease and limit its spread among livestock herds by combating ticks by spraying barns with appropriate pesticides as well as quarantining imported animals in veterinary quarantines.

Sulaymani also indicated that preventive measures that must be taken into account are wearing gloves, shoes, and light-colored clothes, as ticks can be easily detected and disposed of. He also advised against unhealthy handling of ticks, such as crushing them by hand, and to choose animals free of ticks and other external parasites.

CCHF, an often fatal tick-borne viral disease, has made an impact in the Sultanate of Oman -- affecting nationals and expatriates alike -- for the past 26 years. It was 1st reported in Oman in 1995, and serosurveys have suggested widespread infection of humans and livestock throughout the country. The number of cases from 1995-1996 was 4 sporadic ones, then none until 2011, followed by a steady increase in the recent few years.

The disease is endemic in parts of Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and southeastern Europe [5,6,8].

CCHF virus (CCHFV) has been observed in over 30 countries, including in continental Africa (Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa, Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda, Tanzania, Mauritania, Kenya), Asia (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, China), the Middle East (Iran, Iraq, Oman), and southeastern Europe (the Russian Federation, Bulgaria, Albania, Kosovo, Turkey, Greece, and Spain).

[CCHF virus has the greatest geographic range of any tick-borne virus, and there are reports of viral isolation and/or disease from more than 30 countries in Africa, Asia, Eastern and Southern Europe, and the Middle East. Numerous domestic and wild animals -- such as cattle, goats, and sheep; and small mammals such as hares and rodents -- serve as asymptomatic hosts for amplification of the virus, which is transmitted through _Ixodid_ ticks, especially _Hyalomma_ spp. that act as both reservoirs and vectors (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/12/20/502641.full.pdf).

Oman is in the southeastern corner of the Arabian Peninsula, bordering the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Cases of CCHF were 1st detected in Oman in 1995, with 3 unrelated sporadic cases, and another in 1996. A 1996 survey in Oman revealed asymptomatic seropositivity for CCHFV in 1/41 (2.4 percent) of Omanis compared to 73 (30.3 percent) of 241 non-Omani citizens with occupational animal contact. No further human cases of CCHF were reported in Oman until 2011, and there has been a steady increase in cases since then.

Asia lineage 1 (clade IV) of CCHF virus has been identified in one of 1996 confirmed cases from Oman. Al-Abri et al have published a detailed report on CCHF cases from Oman from 2011-17 and describe a higher mortality rate of over 36 percent in their study (http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/502641).

CCHF is well-established throughout Oman, with a single strain of virus present for at least 20 years. Most patients are men involved in animal husbandry and butchery. The high mortality suggests that there is substantial under-diagnosis of milder cases. Preventive measures have been introduced to reduce risks of transmission to animal handlers and butchers and to maintain safety in healthcare settings.

Proven and suspected cases have been reported in expatriate travelers returning from Oman to India and Pakistan, and the possibility of CCHF should be considered in febrile travelers arriving from GCC countries, especially if they have been involved in animal slaughtering; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6504112/.

Oman has responded by improving its notification systems and laboratory support. Active local and regional programs of health promotion and human illness prevention should be maintained, together with surveillance and control of infection in animals and local tick vectors. - Mod.UBA
