A 30-year-old woman from Beni Mazar Center in Minia Governorate [Al Minya], Egypt is the 8th confirmed human case of H5N1 avian influenza [AI] reported in 2014 in the North African country.

According to a Egyptian Ministry of Health press statement (machine translation), the woman was exposed to sick birds (domestic breeding). The statement notes the patient exhibited symptoms on Tue 11 Nov 2014, including fever, sore throat and cough, difficulty breathing and pain in the joints. She started treatment with Tamiflu. She was hospitalsed with double pneumonia and placed in intensive care several days later. She is reportedly in a stable condition.

The Ministry says this is the 7th H5N1 AI case this year [2014]; however, an additional case was reported earlier this year by the Beheira Ministry of Health, a regional health ministry, which would bring the count total to 8.

There have been 2 deaths attributed to the virus so far this year [2014] in Egypt.

[As yet, the WHO listing has not been updated to include the most recent cases in 2014, and the discrepancy in number of cases recorded by different Health Ministries in Egypt cannot be resolved at the present time. The characteristics of the cases are similar: Severe disease affecting mainly women (and often their children) who have been rearing flocks in their homes, and early death despite comprehensive treatment. Of the 15 countries reporting human cases of avian A/H5N1 influenza virus infection, Egypt ranks a close 2nd to Indonesia.
