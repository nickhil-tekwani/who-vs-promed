A cholera epidemic in the Orinoco delta of Venezuela has, since January 1997,
killed 12 and infected 275 people. It is the second outbreak in five years
in the region where out of a population of 120,000 there are 25,000
indigenous Warao Indians. The current outbreak spread from the Warao
community on the remote inland island of Mariusa to Barrascas de Orinoco,
then to other Indian communities in the delta. New cases, which appear to be
abating, are in Curiapo.
