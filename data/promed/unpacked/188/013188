One tick bite and your cat could fall victim to a deadly disease.

Local veterinarians are seeing more and more cats coming in with what's known as "bobcat fever."

Wayne Nichols is holding his cat "Kitten" extra tight because it wasn't long ago when he wasn't sure if the little guy was going to survive.

"She (veterinarian) gave him a 50/50 chance of living," Nichols said. All because of a tick bite.

"He was right out here in the woods laying on a log and he came in and he was biting on his back and I pulled a big old black tick off him," Nichols said.

Within days of the bite, Nichols says he noticed Kitten was moping around and wouldn't eat.

"I took him to the vet and she opened his eyes and the white up in his eyes was hemorrhaged. There was blood in his eyes and she opened his mouth and his throat had swelled shut," Nichols said. "She said I know exactly what he's got. He's got bobcat fever."

Veterinary Clinician Dr Marion Harris with Country View Animal Care Center describes bobcat fever as a blood parasite cats can get.

"It's an infection involving their whole body. They [the affected cats] run a really high fever," Harris said. If left untreated, it could be fatal for felines. "It's probably the most serious disease we face in cats right now," Harris said.

But Dr Harris says cats can recover from the disease if it's caught early enough. "The earlier you can start treatment, the better the odds are of survival," Harris said.

"He's getting back to normal now," Nichols said. "He's my buddy. He sleeps with me, he's got his own pillow and everything. I couldn't do without him."

Even if your cat is an indoor cat, they can still get bobcat fever.

Dr Harris says the only way to prevent it is by stopping ticks from getting on your cat. So if you have a dog which goes in and out of the house, they can be bringing ticks inside to your cat.

He says tick control is the best line of defense against the pests.

["Treating 'bobcat fever' in domestic cats
-----------------------------------------
"Cytauxzoonosis (aka bobcat fever) is an acute, often fatal tick-borne disease caused by the hematoprotozoan parasite _Cytauxzoon felis_. Cytauxzoonosis often strikes healthy, young adult cats who have access to or live outdoors.

"Cats become infected after being bitten by an infected _Amblyomma americanum_ tick (also known as the lone star tick because of the single white mark visible on it). Up to 15 days after being bit, the cat will become ill with symptoms of lethargy and decreased appetite. Infected cats will have a high fever (104-106°F [40-41°C]) and may show signs of anemia (pale gums) and jaundice (yellow discoloration to the skin due to a build-up of bilirubin in the blood).

"Cytauxzoonosis results in protozoal sepsis, characterized by a profound systemic inflammatory response. The result of this systemic inflammation is a high body temperature, increased respiratory rate, clotting abnormalities, and damage to such organ systems as the liver and kidneys. The infection is often complicated by the formation of blood clots, which may result in reduced blood flow to vital organs. Without treatment, cytauxzoonosis can kill within a few days of signs appearing.

"Ordinary antibiotics for common infections are not effective against _C. felis_, a protozoal organism. Standard therapy for cytauxzoonosis is a combination of an antimalarial drug (atovaquone) and antimicrobial medication (azithromycin) in addition to supportive care to provide hydration and electrolyte balance, oxygen supplementation, and nutritional support. A 2013 study found the combination of atovaquone and azithromycin resulted in a 60 percent survival rate. Cats included in this study were from various states across the South and southeastern United States, including Oklahoma. But OSU clinicians have observed cats infected here with cytauxzoonosis have a lower survival rate, possibly due to a different strain that may be more severe or resistant to standard therapy. Current research is studying the potential differences between infections in different geographical regions.

"Cytauxzoonosis is a seasonal infection, with most cats becoming infected between March and September. Usually, there are 2 waves, with the 1st starting in March/April and ending in late June and the 2nd wave between August and September. There may be annual variations in peak months based on rainfall and temperatures, as these variables may impact tick transmission. [The timing of these waves may vary slightly with the specific location and may be more year around closer to the southern coast. - Mod.TG]

"Because cytauxzoonosis is a tick-transmitted disease, the best prevention is tick prevention. All cats in Oklahoma (indoor and outdoor) should receive tick prevention year-round, especially from March through September. Combining multiple tick prevention products (when safe) may be recommended in cats with outdoor exposure, especially in regions near wooded areas or forest, as the combination of bobcats (the natural host and carrier) and ticks are likely in these areas. Discuss tick prevention options with your veterinarian to ensure the products you are using are safe for your cat.

"If you believe your cat is exhibiting signs which could be cytauxzoonosis, have your cat evaluated by a veterinarian immediately, as rapid intervention and treatment may improve the chance of survival."

Be careful of the tick/flea product you choose for your cat. Dog products are not safe for cats and can kill them. The best advice is to check with your veterinarian. Many veterinary clinics sell products such as Revolution plus, specifically for cats, which controls ticks, fleas, heartworms, intestinal parasites, and ear mites. - Mod.TG
