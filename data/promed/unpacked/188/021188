Lassa fever hits refugee camps
----------------
Freetown - 8 people have died of highly infectious Lassa fever in central
Sierra Leone and the disease has spread to camps for Liberian refugees in
the region, health officials said on Wednesday.
Some 80 patients were receiving treatment at the Kenema Government
Hospital, 200km east of Freetown, the manager of the disease prevention
programme in the ministry of health, Magnus Gborie said.
The disease, which leads to high fever, aches, skin trouble and potential
death through heart or kidney failure, is spread by bush rats which urinate
on food, health officials said.
People who eat the contaminated food become infected within 24 hours. Lassa
fever is endemic in both the Kenema and Kailahun districts of Sierra Leone,
but has previously been kept in check with medical assistance from the
Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta in the United States.
However, such aid was scaled down during the civil war that wracked the
west African country from 1991 to 2001.
Gborie said officials from the health ministry, the UN World Health
Organisation and a number of non-governmental organisations have set up a
task force to combat the outbreak.
4 UN peacekeepers in a force deployed in the country have been treated for
Lassa fever and discharged from hospital, officials said.

[Lassa fever virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_, a group of
negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses with bisegmented genomes.
Arenaviruses occur throughout the world, their distribution being
determined by their natural reservoir hosts, primarily rodents.
Arenaviruses are associated with only 2 of the 30 families of rodents; the
_Muridae_ (house mice and rats) and the _Cricetidae_ (voles, deer mice, and
gerbils). They are maintained within their rodent hosts in a chronic
carrier state; in the case of Lassa fever virus, long-term viremia and
little signs of disease. Most arenavirus species occur in the New World and
a few (_Guarito virus_, _Junin virus_, _Machupo virus_, and _Sabia virus_)
are associated with severe hemorrhagic fevers in humans. 5 arenavirus
species are present in the Old World, only 2 of which are associated with
human disease: _Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus_ (LCMV) and _Lassa fever
virus_. LCMV occurs worldwide and causes mild to severe disease, whereas
Lassa fever virus occurs only in West Africa (Sierra Leone and Nigeria) and
is associated with severe, often fatal infection of humans. The rodent
reservoir of Lassa fever virus is _Mastomys natalensis_, an animal which
inhabits human dwellings and surroundings. Rodent-to-human is the
predominant route of transmission of infection in human victims and
probably occurs via aerosols or contact with rodent fluids and detritus.
Less frequently human-to-human transmission can occur also in natural and
hospital settings, probably because of the high aerosol stability of the
virus; hence the need for high-security containment in hospital
environments. - Mod.CP
[In the prior ProMED-mail posting on this outbreak (see Lassa fever -
Sierra Leone (south & east) 20030404.0827 ) we did not have information on
the numbers of cases involved. This newswire suggests that this current
outbreak is significant with at least 80 cases and 8 deaths reported thusfar.
According to the Global Infectious Diseases & Epidemiology Network (GIDEON)
<http://www.gideononline.com> Lassa fever is most common in the eastern
region of Sierra Leone - where one to 4 Mastomys are found in every
household in this area, of which 1--20 percent are infected with the
virus. In some areas of eastern Sierra Leone, the disease accounts for 30
percent of medical death in-hospital, 30 percent of deafness and 70 percent
of spontaneous abortion. 8--52 of the population are seropositive. An
outbreak was reported in Kenema District in 1995, encompassing 167 cases
(60 fatal) - most patients were adolescent females. 799 cases (148 fatal)
were reported in 1996, including 99 cases (13 fatal) from Kenema District
during November and December. 353 (43 fatal) cases were reported during
January to April 1997.
There is a very informative fact sheet on Lassa fever at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/lassaf.htm> "There are
a number of ways in which the virus may be transmitted, or spread, to
humans. The Mastomys rodents shed the virus in urine and droppings.
Therefore, the virus can be transmitted through direct contact with these
materials, through touching objects or eating food contaminated with these
materials, or through cuts or sores. Because Mastomys rodents often live in
and around homes and scavenge on human food remains or poorly stored food,
transmission of this sort is common. Contact with the virus also may occur
when a person inhales tiny particles in the air contaminated with rodent
excretions. This is called aerosol or airborne transmission. Finally,
because Mastomys rodents are sometimes consumed as a food source, infection
may occur via direct contact when they are caught and prepared for food." -
