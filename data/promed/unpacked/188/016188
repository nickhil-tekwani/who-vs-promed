On Tue 2 Mar 2013, a clinically compatible case of measles presented to a Toronto hospital emergency department. The case was subsequently laboratory confirmed as measles via PCR and the presence of measles IgM antibodies in serological tests. This previously healthy 31 year old was born outside Canada and had an unknown vaccination history. The case reported travel to a Playa del Carmen resort in Mexico between 9 Feb 2013 and 16 Feb 2013 (inclusive). A recent report of a measles case in the province of New Brunswick also identified the same resort as a likely exposure site for acquiring their illness.

Toronto Public Health initiated follow-up of family members who travelled with the case and all contacts related to the case returning to work and seeking health care during their infectious period. To date, no additional cases have been identified.

This is the 2nd report of measles linked to vacationing at this resort town in Mexico during this busy travel season. Canadian public health authorities are working to identify other travellers who stayed at the same resort during the known exposure period. The threat of measles transmission may be significant enough to warrant general awareness for anyone travelling to the Playa del Carmen area.

[ProMED-mail thanks Effie Gournis for forwarding this travel alert.

Originally a small fishing town, Playa del Carmen, now known as "Playa," has undergone rapid development over the past 2 years with many new luxury residential condominium buildings, restaurants, boutiques, and entertainment venues. Carmen can be located in the map of Mexico available at: http://www.mexicotravelnet.com/mexico_maps/riviera_maya.htm.

This report clearly identifies Playa del Carmen as a source of measles virus infection, and travellers should ensure that they have received MMR vaccination prior to travel to this resort. - Mod.CP
