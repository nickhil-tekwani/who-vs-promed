The Washington State Veterinary Office has confirmed a horse at a private facility in Yakima County with West Nile virus (WNV).

WNV transmission occurs when infected mosquitoes feed on animals, as well as humans, after having fed on infected birds.

Clinical signs of WNV in horses include:
- mild anorexia and depression;
- fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculation;
- hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound);
- changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they're daydreaming or "just not with it";
- occasional drowsiness;
- propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control);
- spinal signs, including asymmetrical weakness; and
- asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia.

West Nile virus has no cure; however, some horses can recover with supportive care. Equine mortality rates can reach 30-40%. The American Association of Equine Practitioners includes WNV as one of the core diseases all horses should be vaccinated against at least annually.

[It is mosquito time of the year in most areas of the USA, Europe, and other regions. It is time to protect yourself as you are sensitive to this virus as well. It is also time to protect your equine friends.

There is a very effective vaccine for horses. Please be sure your animals are vaccinated every year against West Nile virus. Please also vaccinate for other diseases such as eastern and western equine encephalitis, rabies, and tetanus. Additionally, please use horse approved sprays to help reduce the chances of mosquitoes on your horses.

Remember to empty any standing water from old tires, potted plants, catch basins, or other locations which can hold even a small amount of water. These are perfect breeding grounds for mosquitoes. - Mod.TG
