A local resident says 4 dogs have died in a central Phoenix neighborhood after veterinarians found traces of poison in their systems. [MD] said his 2 corgis died just a few days apart about a month ago.

He has been posting fliers in his neighborhood, near 10th Street and Montebello Avenue, warning residents and asking for any information about suspicious activity.

[MD] said his youngest dog, an 8-month-old corgi, was the first to show signs of illness. "She was very lethargic and started to get very cold," said the man. He took her to a vet, who noticed she was very dehydrated. After some medical tests, the vet concluded that [the dog's] kidneys were failing.

[MD] said his dog had "less than a 10-percent chance to live," so they made the difficult decision to put her down.

His 2 dogs died after poison was found in their systems. The vet told him they had found traces of ibuprofen in her system, which ultimately led to her kidneys failing.

The 2nd dog was just 11-months-old when MD went through a similar situation.

The one thing different about the 2nd dog was that anti-freeze was found in his system by the vet rather than ibuprofen, according to the toxicology reports, said [MD]. He decided to also put down the dog after his health was quickly deteriorating.

Another 2 other residents experienced similar cases with their dogs and reached out to [MD] after seeing the fliers, he said.

[MD] is still not sure how his dogs were poisoned since they mostly stayed indoors, but he suspects his dogs must have encountered the poison when they went outside to the backyard. "Someone probably threw something into our backyard and that's maybe how they got into it," he said.

[MD] is advising dog owners to be aware of their surroundings when they let their pets outside so that what happened to him does not happen to anyone else. "I wouldn't let them walk out by themselves," he said. "Just be with them all the time."

[MD] has not yet reported the incidents to police, but said he is planning to with the other families whose dogs were also poisoned.

[Ibuprofen can be fond in a number of products, such as Advil, Midol, and Motrin, for over the counter purchase, as well as in prescription strength medications. While this drug is relatively safe for humans, taken in the recommended doses, it is often very toxic to dogs and has a relatively narrow margin of safety.

Dogs with ibuprofen poisoning may vomit, have GI distress, renal (kidney) issues, and central nervous system problems.

Anti-freeze, also known as ethylene glycol, is a toxic agent that can affect multiple body systems. It affects the kidneys rather profoundly, the brain (drunkenness), and the liver, which can metabolize only a small amount of the toxic agent.

Both of these toxins (ibuprofen, and ethylene glycol antifreeze) can cause severe kidney damage. There is treatment but it should be initiated as soon as possible, certainly before 24 hours post ingestion.

Toxicology testing of the tissues or blood may be necessary to distinguish between the 2 types of kidney failure.

This is a very sad situation and owners of pets in the area should be on alert for anything in the yard or pathways your pet may have access too.

Certainly we hope the perpetrator(s) of such a terrible act will be caught. - Mod.TG
