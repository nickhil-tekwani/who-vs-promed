[This disease, caused by a virus of the family Poxviridae, is endemic in
large parts of Africa, Middle East and Asia. It generally has a high
morbidity, low mortality pattern unless the exposed animal population has
no experience with the disease.
Clinical signs vary, but the eyes often show conjunctivitis, lacrimation,
and photophobia. Rhinitis is also common. Cutaneous eruption beginning with
erythematous areas -- most easily seen in hair- or wool-free parts of the
body, such as the perineum, inguinal area, scrotum, udder, muzzle, eyelids
and axillae -- progress to form papules. Formation of nodules in the lung
and broncopneumonia are also common. Control is by vaccination and movement
restriction on animals and vehicles. - Mod PC]
