Between [11 and 14 Jan 2016], the National IHR Focal Point of the United Arab Emirates notified WHO of 2 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including one death.

Details of the cases
1- A 73-year-old male from Abu Dhabi developed symptoms on [27 Dec 2015] and visited a health care clinic in Abu Dhabi. He was treated symptomatically and sent home on the same day. On [31 Dec 2015], the patient travelled to Oman with family members and returned back to Abu Dhabi on [1 Jan 2016]. On the same day, he developed symptoms and was admitted to hospital. The patient, who had no comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [10 Jan 2016]. He passed away on [25 Jan 2016]. The patient had a history of frequent contact with camels. He consumed raw camel milk once in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. He had no history of exposure to other risk factors in Abu Dhabi and in Oman in the 14 days prior to onset of symptoms.

2- An 85-year-old female from Abu Dhabi was detected through the tracing of contacts. The patient is a contact of a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case (see above). She has no history of exposure to other risk factors in the 14 days prior to detection. The patient, who has comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [13 Jan 2016]. Currently, she is asymptomatic and admitted to a negative pressure isolation room on a ward.

Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases.

Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1632 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 587 related deaths.

[This is the WHO report with more details on the case(s) reported in MERS-CoV (06): UAE (AZ) 20160114.3937314. The common thread in recently reported cases seems to be that the index case has a history of contact with camels, and then asymptomatic infected contacts are occasionally identified.

[2] Oman, epidemiologic investigation - MOH
Date: 26 Jan 2016
From: Seif Al-Abri <salabri@gmail.com> [edited]


We conducted the public health investigation [in Oman, and] there is no link between the 2 recent cases reported from Oman; they both live in different areas and have been admitted to 2 different hospitals, 200 km away from each other.

The PCR screening of all the contacts from the newly diagnosed patient who is currently in Thailand are all negative.

All 3 Omani patients with MERS-CoV infection in the past 12 months (75 year old diagnosed in Thailand in June 2015, 44 year old diagnosed in Oman in early January 2016, and the 71 year old diagnosed in Thailand from 24 Jan 2016) had a history of direct contact with camels.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Seif Al-Abri for providing information on the epidemiologic investigation's findings in Oman on this newly reported case of MERS-CoV infection currently admitted to a hospital in Thailand (see MERS-CoV (10): Saudi Arabia (MK), Thailand ex Oman, RFI 20160125.3964309, MERS-COV (08): Thailand ex Oman, Saudi Arabia corr 20160124.3962172).

Again, a common observation is that recently confirmed cases have a history of contact with camels and have not been associated with nosocomial transmission.

The patient has a history of frequent contact with camels and consumption of their raw milk. He has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms.

2- An 85-year-old male from Bisha city developed symptoms on [3 Jan 2016]. On the same day, the patient visited a hospital where he was treated symptomatically and sent home. On [9 Jan 2016], the patient travelled by airplane to Riyadh to seek medical care. Once in Riyadh, he was admitted to hospital. The patient, who has comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [11 Jan 2016]. Currently, he is in stable condition in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward. The patient has a history of frequent contact with camels and consumption of their raw milk. He has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. [This case was reported as having recovered today (26 Jan 2016) on the Saudi MOH website. - Mod.MPP]

3- A 59-year-old male from Onizah city developed symptoms on [18 Dec 2015] and, on [27 Dec 2015], was admitted to hospital. The patient, who is a heavy smoker and has comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [28 Dec 2015]. Currently, he is in critical condition in ICU. The patient has a history of frequent contact with camels and consumption of their raw milk. He has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms [reported as having recovered on 19 Jan 2016. - Mod.MPP].

4- A 54-year-old male from Jeddah city developed symptoms on [14 Dec 2015] and, on [24 Dec 2015], was admitted to hospital.

[As of today, 26 Jan 2016, there have been a total of 1632 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including at least 586 deaths reported to WHO (reported case fatality rate 35.9 percent). The above reported cases from Saudi Arabia provide additional details from previous reports (see prior ProMED-mail reports below).

It appears as though the common theme in today's [26 Jan 2016] updates is that recently reported cases of MERS-CoV infection are primarily associated with contact with camels. Hopefully, there will not be recurrent nosocomial outbreaks as seen in the past.
