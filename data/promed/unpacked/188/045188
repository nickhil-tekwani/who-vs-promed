Health officials are investigating an outbreak of legionnaires' disease apparently centered at a northwest Alabama nursing home. 11 lab-confirmed cases have been seen in the Florence area. Another 8 pneumonia illnesses are being investigated as possibly also legionnaires' [disease]. The Alabama Department of Public Health released details of the investigation Wednesday [16 Oct 2013]. No one has died, but 2 were hospitalized.

Legionnaires' disease is a bacterial infection that can cause deadly pneumonia. It does not spread from person to person. Instead, people get it from inhaling contaminated mist or vapor. Tainted shower water, air conditioning systems, or whirlpool spas are among the ways bacteria get in the air.

The source of the current outbreak is not yet known, but at least 8 of the cases have been living at a Florence [Alabama] nursing home.

[The news report says that 11 laboratory-confirmed and another 8 suspected cases of legionnaires' disease have occurred in the Florence, Alabama area. However, we are not told the time-line for the outbreak, nor any epidemiologic linkages among the cases, other than 8 of the cases occurred at a Florence, Alabama nursing home. We are also not told how many of the 8 cases at the nursing home are laboratory-confirmed or suspected, the species of _Legionella_ involved, or how the diagnosis was confirmed -- that is, by culture, serology, or urinary antigen (a test that can only identify infection due to _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1).

Although healthy individuals can contract this disease, legionnaires' disease attacks more frequently and is more severe in individuals who are elderly, smokers, alcoholics, or who have an underlying illness such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or a weakened immune system as a result of, for example, organ transplant or taking immunosuppressive drugs (such as corticosteroid therapy) for other reasons. Nursing facilities often house many of these relatively vulnerable people.

Florence, with a population was 39 319 (2010), is located on the Tennessee River in the northwestern corner of the US state of Alabama (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence,_Alabama#Culture_and_events).
Florence is the largest city in the region known as "The Shoals" that includes the adjacent city of Muscles Shoals, which since the 1960s has been famous for the "Muscle Shoals Sound" as local recording studios produced hit records of popular music (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_Shoals,_Alabama). - Mod.ML
