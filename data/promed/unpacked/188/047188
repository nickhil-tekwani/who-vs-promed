West Nile [virus sickens Kenner patient
----------------------------------------
A Kenner man who was hospitalized last month with "severe neurological
symptoms" was found Monday to have contracted the potentially deadly
West Nile virus, the first human case reported in Louisiana.
The middle-aged man, said to be a drifter who spent an unusual amount
of time on the streets, remains in stable condition at Kenner Regional
Medical Center, a hospital spokesperson said. The man frequented the
area near the Kenner-Metairie line where 5 dead birds have tested
positive for West
Nile in recent months.
"It is not extraordinary that a person who is outside a lot and not
taking [anti-mosquito precautions has come down with the disease,"
said Dr. Raoult Ratard, state epidemiologist. "But I don't think we
are going to have an outbreak. It's very late in the season."

The man was admitted to Kenner Regional Medical Center on 29 Sep
2001.. Officials would not elaborate on his symptoms. They said that
after extensive testing to rule out other illnesses, doctors checked
for West Nile encephalitis. A Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention lab in Fort Collins, Colorado, confirmed Monday that he had
West Nile [virus.
Twenty-five people have been infected this year with the
brain-swelling West Nile virus, in Connecticut, New Jersey, New York,
Maryland, Florida and Georgia, according to a CDC report released this
month. One patient has died.
Ratard said doctors think the man was bitten by an infected mosquito
around 15 Sep 2001. No other human cases are suspected in the area, he
said.
West Nile encephalitis cases occur primarily in the late summer or
early fall, but the disease can be transmitted year-round in Southern
climates where temperatures are milder, according to the CDC. Besides
the dead birds found in Jefferson Parish, the state has confirmed the
virus in 5 horses in Vermilion Parish, proving West Nile is
established in Louisiana, Ratard said.
Mosquito Control Inc., which contracts with Jefferson Parish to spray
insecticide, has stepped up ground and aerial spraying within a 3-mile
radius of where the dead birds were found and is using the highest
concentration of insecticide allowed by the Environmental Protection
Agency, officials said.
