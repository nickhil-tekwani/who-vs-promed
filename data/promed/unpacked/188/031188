Chronic Wasting Disease Found in [a] Hampshire County Deer
----------------------------------------------------------
The West Virginia Division of Natural Resources (DNR) announced today
[2 Sep 2005] that it has received confirmation that a road-killed
deer in Hampshire County tested positive for Chronic Wasting Disease
(CWD). "This is the 1st known occurrence of CWD in West Virginia,"
said Director Frank Jezioro. "Upon receiving this confirmation, we
initiated our CWD Response Plan, which is designed to effectively
address this important wildlife disease issue."
The CWD Response Plan is specifically designed to accomplish the
following goals:
(1) determine the prevalence and the distribution of CWD through
enhanced surveillance efforts;
(2) communicate and coordinate with the public and other appropriate
agencies on issues relating to CWD and the steps being taken to
respond to this disease;
(3) initiate appropriate management actions necessary to control the
spread of this disease, prevent further introductions of the disease
and possibly eliminate the disease from the state.
The West Virginia Division of Natural Resources, in cooperation with
the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study located at the
University of Georgia's College of Veterinary Medicine, has tested
1320 free-ranging deer from West Virginia for CWD since 2002, and the
Hampshire County deer is the only animal found, thus far, to be
infected with CWD. The positive CWD sample was collected from a
2-year-old male deer in Hampshire County as part of a long-term
statewide CWD surveillance effort. The Hampshire County deer tissue
sample was 1st tested at the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife
Disease Study in Athens, Georgia, and then confirmed as positive for
CWD by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary
Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa.
CWD is a neurological disease found in deer and elk, and it belongs
to a family of diseases known as transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies. The disease is thought to be caused by abnormal,
proteinaceous particles, called prions, that slowly attack the brain
of infected deer and elk, causing the animals to progressively become
emaciated and display abnormal behavior, invariably resulting in the
death of the infected animal. There is no known treatment for CWD,
and it is always fatal for the infected deer or elk. It is important
to note that, currently, there is no evidence to suggest that CWD
poses a risk for humans or for domestic animals.
CWD was 1st recognized in 1967 in Colorado, and it subsequently was
found in captive herds in 9 states and in 2 Canadian provinces and in
free-ranging deer or elk in 9 states and one province. Earlier this
year [2005], the disease was found as far east as New York. The
source of infection for wild and captive deer and elk in new
geographical areas is unknown in many instances. While it is not
known exactly how CWD is transmitted, lateral spread from animal to
animal through shedding of the infectious agent from the digestive
tract appears to be important, and indirect transmission through
environmental contamination with infective material is likely.
"While the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources certainly
considers this a serious wildlife disease situation with potential
impacts on the state's important deer management program, I am
confident that our well trained and professional staff of wildlife
biologists, wildlife managers and conservation officers will meet
this challenge and implement appropriate management strategies," said
Jezioro. "In addition, we are most fortunate to have scientists and
veterinarians stationed at the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife
Disease Study, including some of the foremost wildlife disease
experts in the world, available to assist us in this effort."

[Earlier this year (2005), New York announced it had found CWD -- see ProMED
refs. below. Now West Virginia has found it. Nearby states will certainly step
up their surveillance. Although this disease is a transmissible spongiform
encephalopathy (TSE), it has not been shown to have any effect on humans. -
