The Veterinary Services yesterday confirmed in lab tests that 460 cows in
the Lachish area had died of botulinum type D infections. The disease,
spread by bacteria, and for which all local cattle are vaccinated, is not
harmful to man. "It is not clear", said Dr Oded Nir, Director of the
Veterinary Services, "how the affected cattle took sick, as they had been
vaccinated". In rare occasions, the vaccine does not "take."
Only a handful of cows in the area have died in recent days. When the
deaths stop, the Veterinary Services will allow the moshavim [collective
farms] involved to resume sale of their milk even though the disease is not
known to pass to milk.
The deaths of the cows caused significant financial harm to the
Lachish-area moshavim, but insurance companies should reimburse the farmers
for the dead cows. Each cow is worth 4500 to 5000 NIS [900 to 1000 US
dollars]. The Israel Dairy Board, Nir said, will also compensate them, at
least for the milk that was destroyed.

[Major outbreaks of Botulism types C and D have been described in various
countries during recent years. In January 1990, during an outbreak in 2
beef feedlots on the Darling Downs in Queensland, Australia, 5500 head of
cattle from a total population of approximately 30 000 head were reported
to have died of Botulism type D (see reference 19980428.0813). During an
outbreak in a dairy farm in California in April 1998, more than 400 head
were reported to have died; type C was involved. Outbreaks have been
reported in various other countries.
Israel has witnessed several such outbreaks throughout the years. In 1978,
a major outbreak of botulism type D caused the deaths and emergency
slaughter of more than 1000 animals, most of them dairy cattle. Spores of
_Cl. botulinum_ type D spread to many farms from 2 central animal feed
plants by recycled, non-sterilized poultry manure that included remains of
avian cadavers. Subsequently, annual botulism vaccinations of cattle and of
other vulnerable animals with a vaccine, including toxoids of _Cl.
botulinum_ types C and D adsorbed onto aluminum hydroxide gel, have been
introduced and are routinely applied in most parts of the country. Sporadic
cases involving unvaccinated animals (mainly young cows) have been reported
to occur every year.

Since 1996, the feeding of milking cows, sheep, and goats with poultry
manure was officially banned, while feeding of all animals was prohibited
during 15 days prior to slaughter.
The above press information on the current outbreak is rather limited;
clarifications from the professionals involved on the suspected source of
contamination, detection of toxin and/or bacteria in feed and in the
diseased animals, as well as detailed epidemiological and clinical data
will be useful. Of particular interest would be confirmation (or otherwise)
of the vaccine allegedly used: its manufacture, testing, and vaccination
regime.
The veterinary and public-health authorities involved are to be commended
for the early diagnosis and their timely extra safety measure in
withdrawing the milk from the food chain (despite the fact that botulinum
type D is generally regarded as non-pathogenic to humans).
