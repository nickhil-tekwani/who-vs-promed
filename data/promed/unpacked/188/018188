The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) reported that a 10-year-old quarterhorse gelding from Shasta County tested positive for West Nile virus [WNV] on 22 Sep 2016. The horse, whose vaccination status is unknown, was displaying neurological signs but is reportedly recovering, the CDFA said.

Thus far in 2016, 19 horses have tested positive for WNV in the following counties: Calaveras, Fresno (2 cases), Merced, Riverside, Sacramento (3 cases), San Diego, San Joaquin (6 cases), Shasta, Sutter (2 cases), and Ventura. Seven of those 19 horses died or were euthanized.

"17 of the positive horses were not current on their WNV vaccinations, and 2 horses had unknown vaccination status," the CDFA said.

In Kentucky, animal health officials have confirmed the 4th equine WNV case of 2016, on 23 Sep 2016.

In a statement, Kentucky Equine Programs manager E.S. "Rusty" Ford said the affected horse -- a 4-year-old Standardbred mare from Hart County -- began showing signs of disease on 15 Sep 2016. She presented with moderate hind limb ataxia (incoordination), muscle fasciculation (twitching), and lip paresis. As of 23 Sep 2016, Ford said the mare's condition has improved, and she has a good prognosis to make a full recovery.

The affected horse has no WNV vaccination history, Ford said.

The Minnesota Board of Animal Health also reported a new WNV case in an unvaccinated quarterhorse gelding from Motley, in Morrison County. That horse, which was unable to stand without assistance, was confirmed positive on 21 Sep 2016.

The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection has confirmed additional cases of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) and West Nile virus (WNV) in horses in that state, the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported on 26 Sep 2016. Additionally, the EDCC reported the state's 7th equine WNV case for the year.

"The unvaccinated 5-year-old Paint mare, located in Jefferson County, presented on 10 Sep 2016 with muscle fasciculation, rear weakness, and knuckling over of the left hind, and had a fever early on," the center said. "The mare was sampled on 15 Sep 2016, confirmed positive on 23 Sep 2016, and is doing well at this time."

West Nile virus is also transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs for WNV include flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed; fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculation (twitching); hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound); changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they are daydreaming or "just not with it;" occasional somnolence (drowsiness); propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and "spinal" signs, including asymmetrical weakness. Some horses show asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia. Equine mortality rates can be as high as 30-40 percent.

Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3-6 week period.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito population and possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using mosquito repellents.

[This has been an extremely busy year for West Nile virus. It is a preventable disease by a series of 2 intramuscular vaccinations. This is a very small financial and time investment to keep your equine friends alive. Control mosquitoes and vaccinate.
