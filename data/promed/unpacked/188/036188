From: DR J PICARD <infek4@op1.up.ac.za>

South African veterinary students are taught to recognise _Bacillus
anthracis_ on blood smears made from herbivors. They are taught to
recognise the organism in smears stained with Romanosky-type stains, as
these are more freely available. The organisms usually are large
brick-shaped purple bacteria with a pink capsule. I agree that aged
Loeffler's methylene blue stain (McFaydean's stain) is better, and would
encourage its use. This stain should still be available in many countries
as it is a counter-stain used in the modified acid-fast stain.
Although newer tests are being developed, these tests should only be used
if they are better (more sensitive and specific) than the "older"
techniques as well as been more cost-effective.

[It should be noted that using blood smears works fine as long as the
animal, e.g., dairy cow, has not been on antibiotics when blood smears will
be essentially abacteraemic. Tests based on the presence/absence of
Protective antigen would still work. I think we can now cut this thread. -
