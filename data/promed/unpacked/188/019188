The Director General of Health, Central Equatoria State [South Sudan], Dr Paul Tingwa, says that cholera is still spreading in the state, particularly in Juba Nabari and Rajaf Payams of Juba County, but also to other counties including Yei, Kajo-Keji and Lainya County. In an interview with Radio Tamazuj on Wednesday, 4 Jun 2014, the health official stressed that control of cholera is not the responsibility of the ministry alone, but of every person in South Sudan.

He warned residents of west Nile not to drink water directly from the river before boiling, and also encouraged people to follow health regulations as one way of eradicating cholera from South Sudan.

Dr. Tingwa said that up to yesterday evening [3 Jun 2014] the cases of cholera have increased to 1138 cases, most of them in Juba itself, the national capital.

Another humanitarian official, UN Assistant Secretary-General Toby Lanzer, said that the number was higher than that, putting it at 1209 as of the end of the day on Monday, 2 Jun 2014, citing the "latest consolidated data." There have been at least 29 fatalities so far.

Health officials say that those who contract cholera typically have been drinking from unsafe water sources, eating foods sold on the roadside or at makeshift markets, or practicing poor hygiene.

One of the hardest hit neighborhoods, Gumbo of Rajaf Payam, which is on the east bank of the Nile just opposite from Juba, saw 164 suspected or confirmed cholera cases between 23 Apr 2014 and 31 May 2014.
