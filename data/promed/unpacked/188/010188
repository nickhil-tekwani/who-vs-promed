The Department of Health of Pernambuco investigated 3 cases of botulism in members of the same family, residents of Olinda, in Greater Recife. A 48 year old is hospitalized at Oswaldo Cruz University Hospital (Huoc), in the central area of the capital. He was admitted on [Thu 25 Jan 2018] with facial paralysis and difficulty swallowing. His parents, a 69-year-old man and a 65-year-old woman are also affected.

On [Tue 30 Jan 2018], the medical team of Oswaldo Cruz detailed the case during a press conference. According to the unit's infectious disease head, Demetrius Montenegro, the patient began to show classic symptoms of toxin action. "In this case, the problem is in the muscle of the face and in the neck area, which makes it difficult to swallow," he explained. Still according to the doctor, the patient is considered stable. Because of the difficulty of swallowing, he is fed through a tube but he is expected to be discharged from the Intensive Care Unit. Materials were collected with blood, gastric lavage and intestinal lavage of the patients. The samples were sent to the Adolfo Lutz Institute, in São Paulo, for epidemiological confirmation.

According to the State Department of Health, the patient's parents are hospitalized in a private hospital in Recife. Both had facial and lower limb paralysis. Still according to the briefcase, the health of the women is stable and showed improvement in limb movement. The man did not present improvement in the limbs, but his state of health is stable. It is not yet known what would have caused the disease.

According to SES, the two men received the anti-botulinum serum, which needs to be applied within 7 days after the onset of symptoms.

The State Department of Health said that the cases of the disease in Pernambuco are rare. There was 1 case of botulism in 2007 and 3 in 2016. In all of them, patients evolved well and without sequelae, according to the brief.

By means of a note, the State Department of Health reported that the technical team of the Pernambuco Agency of Sanitary Surveillance (Apevisa) was in the patients' home on [Mon 29 Jan 2018]. The visit was also attended by the Sanitary Surveillance of Olinda and the Epidemiological Surveillance of SES.

At the residence, the teams collected some food samples such as jerky, honey, kingdom cheese and pot-guava. The samples were sent for analysis at the Adolfo Lutz Institute in São Paulo to check for the presence of botulinum toxin.

The Health Department of Ribeirão Preto [São Paulo state] confirmed the [diagnosis of botulism in the case of a 52-year-old lawyer hospitalized a month ago at the Hospital São Lucas] and reported that there are 2 more suspected cases under investigation. According to the documentation, these 2 patients also present neurological alterations that could be caused by botulism.

According to [her daughter], the lawyer was hospitalized on [2 Jan 2018] with dizziness, nausea, weakness, photophobia, and difficulty swallowing. "Initially we thought she had had a stroke, but at the hospital, after the tests, the doctor ruled it out and suspected botulism," says the daughter. The lawyer was hospitalized at about 5:30 pm. At 11 pm on the same day she was transferred to the ICU (intensive care unit), where she had a respiratory arrest. The next day, even before the results of the tests were announced, the patient had already received antibotulin serum.

However, the appearance of neurological changes on day 4 made the medical team also suspect the patient was suffering from Guillain-Barré syndrome, but the disease was later ruled out.

The lawyer, who was hospitalized in the ICU for 20 days, suffered paralysis of the limbs. She is already in a room, where she is gradually regaining her movements, but her discharge is not being considered. "She is still breathing with assisted ventilation, but she has reacted well. She can open her eyes and she is conscious," says the daughter, who adds that the lawyer can already move her hands and legs, change her body position and, although she does not yet speak due to a tracheostomy, she communicates with her children through writing. "We are very optimistic that the risk phase of the disease has passed and now we expect all movement to return."

The daughter praised the rapid medical intervention and accurate diagnosis of the team of Hospital São Lucas. "As doctors suspected from the outset that it could be botulism and have already administered the serum, the chance of full recovery is 100 percent. "

ACidadeON news tried to contact neurologist Francisco Coletto, head of the team responsible for the lawyer's case, but could not contact him. A message was left with his secretary at his private practice, but at the time of publication of this report, there had been no response.

Health surveillance
-------------------
The lawyer's daughter said that the Sanitary Surveillance took milk and a soy cheese from the patient's home to try to determine the origin of the bacteria that caused the disease. According to the health department, the material was sent to Adolfo Lutz for analysis and the results are awaited.

[It is unclear, but not unreasonable to think that the 2 outbreaks in separate Brazilian states could be related to the same food vehicle which at this point is unknown.

A review of botulism in Brazil is:
Rowlands RE, Ristori CA, Lopes GI, et al: Botulism in Brazil, 2000-2008: epidemiology, clinical findings and laboratorial diagnosis. Rev Inst Med Trop Sao Paulo. 2010;52(4):183-6.

Abstract
--------
Botulism is a rare and potentially lethal illness caused by _Clostridium botulinum_ neurotoxin. We describe the findings of a laboratorial investigation of 117 suspected cases of botulism reported to the surveillance system in Brazil from January 2000 to October 2008. Data on the number and type of samples analyzed, type of toxins identified, reporting of the number of botulism cases and transmission sources are discussed. A total of 193 clinical samples and 81 food samples were analyzed for detection and identification of the botulism neurotoxin. Among the clinical samples, 22 (11.4 percent) presented the toxin (9 type A, 5 type AB and 8 with an unidentified type); in food samples, eight (9.9 percent) were positive for the toxin (5 type A, 1 type AB and 2 with an unidentified type). Of the 38 cases of suspected botulism in Brazil, 27 were confirmed by a mouse bioassay. Laboratorial botulism diagnosis is an important procedure to elucidate cases, especially food-borne botulism, to confirm clinical diagnosis and to identify toxins in food, helping sanitary control measures.
