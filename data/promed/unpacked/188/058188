Hurricane Sandy and Legionnaires' disease
-----------------------------------------
In the past several years, we have uncovered anecdotal cases of Legionnaires' disease associated with flooding in the US. Sporadic [cases] and outbreaks of both nosocomial and community-acquired Legionnaires' disease have occurred. In 2011, excessive rainfall plus flooding in Pittsburgh were followed by sporadic community-acquired Legionnaires' disease plus a dramatic outbreak in 2 neighboring nursing homes in which 15 patients contracted the disease over a period of 2 weeks. _Legionella_ in the tap water of both nursing homes matched that of the patients.

Moreover, 4 epidemiological studies from the US and Netherlands have linked heavy rainfall to increased frequency of Legionnaires' disease. An ongoing study in collaboration with the Allegheny County Health Dept (Pittsburgh) and the Special Pathogens Lab of Pittsburgh shows a direct correlation of frequency of Legionnaires' disease and rainfall intensity (inches/hour). The mechanism is massive entry of _Legionella_ into the tap water distribution system of large buildings and hospitals.

Given the massive flooding with Hurricane Sandy, physicians in Northeastern US and West Virginia, North Carolina, and Virginia should have a high index of suspicion for Legionnaires' disease. Family practitioners, internists, geriatricians, emergency room MDs, hospitalists and intensivists should use the _Legionella_ urinary antigen [assay to aid in the diagnosis of] patients with onset of either [suspected] community-acquired or hospital-acquired Legionnaires' disease. If the water supply of the hospital shows _Legionella_ species other than _L. pneumophila_ or non-serogroup 1 _L. pneumophila_ species, culture using selective media of sputum is necessary to make the diagnosis, since the urine antigen detects only _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1.

The patients most easily overlooked are elderly residents in nursing homes or immunosuppressed children in Childrens Hospitals.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Victor Yu for drawing our attention to the risk of Legionnaires' disease following heavy rainfall, although no increased incidence of Legionnaires' disease has apparently been noted following Hurricane Sandy at this time. Hurricane Sandy, the largest Atlantic hurricane on record, moved ashore near Atlantic City, New Jersey early on 29 Oct 2012. The incubation period for Legionnaires' disease is 2-14 days after exposure.

The incidence of Legionnaires' disease is consistently highest during the warm summer months, which may coincide with periods of heavy rainfall. As mentioned in a prior ProMED-mail post (Legionellosis, fatal - UK (02): (Wales) 20100916.3352), several studies have indicated an association between rainfall and legionellosis (1-5). Heavy rains during the warm season might favor the growth of _Legionella_ spp, which is enhanced by warm temperatures. However, it is unclear exactly how heavy rainfall would lead to increased incidence of legionellosis. Perhaps, run-off of organic sediment during heavy rainfall might contaminate municipal water systems, and the contaminated water is then aerosolized by different mechanisms.

To account for Legionnaires' disease in truck drivers, Japanese investigators hypothesized that contaminated aerosols may enter a car when a car is driven through rainfall puddled on roadway surfaces, as they isolated _Legionella_ from rain puddles on asphalt roads, especially during warm weather (6). Flooding following heavy rainfall has been identified as a precipitant of one outbreak in a bar in St Louis, where a sump pump in a flooded basement promoted _Legionella_ amplification and subsequent aerosolization (7). In the Netherlands, Schets et al. (8) found _Legionella_ in rainwater collected in roof reservoirs, which may pose a health risk when aerosols containing _Legionella_ are formed during toilet flushing or showering and then inhaled.
