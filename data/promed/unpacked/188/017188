A number of al-Qaida militants in training have been killed by
plague, the disease believed to have ravaged Europe in the Middle
Ages. At least 40 al-Qaida followers have died since the disease
swept through a training camp in Algeria, as was reported on Monday
[19 Jan 2009]. The deaths became known when security forces found a
body beside a road.

The victims were associated with "al-Qaida in the Land of the Islamic
Maghreb," the largest and most powerful al-Qaida group outside the
Middle East. Al-Qaida leaders said they fear the plague has spread to
other cells or to Taliban fighters in Afghanistan. The epidemic began
in the hideouts of AQLIM (al-Qaida in the Land of the Islamic
Maghreb) in Algiers, sources said. The group fled to Bejaia and Jijel
provinces.

[Whether person-to-person spread of _Y. pestis_ via pneumonic plague,
the only form of human plague transmissible between people, has
occurred is not clear.

The outbreak has been reported to have occurred in Tizi Ouzou
province, 150 km east of the capital Algiers. In June 2003, an
outbreak of plague emerged in the Oran area of Algeria. During the
following weeks, a total of 11 confirmed and 7 suspected cases of
plague were reported from the same area. All cases were bubonic
plague; septicemia and coma later developed in 2 patients. According
to national health records, the last outbreak in Oran was in 1946,
and the last human cases of plague occurred in Algeria in 1950 (1).

The 2003 outbreak brought to mind the novel written by Nobel
Prize-winning novelist Albert Camus, "The Plague," which chronicled a
1940s plague outbreak in Oran, Algeria, which began with a rat
die-off in and around the apartment building of the protagonist Dr.
Bernard Rieux.
