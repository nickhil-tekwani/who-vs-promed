A new strain of bacteria is emerging as a major cause of childhood
infections but even drug-resistant versions of the bug can be killed
off with the right antibiotics, doctors said on Thursday [18 Oct
2007]. Doctors and parents should be aware of it, however, and switch
antibiotics for children with severe infections who do not respond
quickly to standard therapy.

The bacterium is a type of _Streptococcus pneumonia[e]_ that is not
one of the 7 strains covered in a routine childhood vaccine [Prevnar,
the heptavalent conjugate pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine], a
team at Boston University and the Massachusetts health department
reported. "I think clinicians should be aware that the vaccine, as
effective as it is, still leaves children at risk for invasive
pneumococcal disease," Dr. Stephen Pelton, chief of pediatric
infectious disease at Boston University, said in a telephone interview.

Wyeth's Prevnar, given routinely to young children, protects
against 7 strains of _S. pneumoniae_, known commonly as pneumococcal
bacteria. These germs cause ear infections, meningitis, pneumonia,
and blood infections. The vaccine has greatly reduced the number of
infections among not only children, but also older adults. Pelton
said Massachusetts had seen a 75 percent reduction in the number of
severe pneumococcal cases since 2000.

Wyeth and government agencies gave the Massachusetts team funding to
look to see what other strains of bacteria were now stepping into the
void. They found the 19A strain was becoming more common. "It causes
about 40 percent of pneumococcal infections in children under the age
of 18 in Massachusetts," Pelton said. He said the percentage was
similar across the United States.

In 2001-2002, just 10 percent of cases were caused by the 19A strain.
The strain resists penicillin and in many cases, also amoxicillin,
Pelton's team reports in this week's issue of the US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention's report on death and disease
[<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5641a2.htm>]. And 15
percent were resistant to another antibiotic called ceftriaxone.

For the drug-resistant strains of _S. pneumoniae_, Pelton said the
antibiotic vancomycin will work, or combination therapy with
vancomycin and cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. Healthy children are not
considered at serious risk from the infection but Pelton said
children with sickle cell disease, HIV infection, lung disease,
diabetes, or kidney disease need special attention.

[Increases in the proportion of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD),
that is, meningitis, pneumonia, or bacteremia without focus, caused
by pneumococcal serotypes not covered by the heptavalent conjugate
pneumococcal vaccine (PCV7) since its release in 2000 have been
reported previously (see ProMED-mail posting 20070425.1348 and
<http://www.boston.com/yourlife/health/diseases/articles/2007/09/17/vaccine_tied_to_superbug_ear_infection/>).
PCV7 covers pneumococcal serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F.
The news release above refers to a CDC report
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5641a2.htm>) of IPD
surveillance in Massachusetts during 2001-2006 that identified an
increased number of cases in children (less than 18 years of age)
caused by pneumococcal serotypes (most notably 19A) not covered by
PCV7 and an associated increase in antimicrobial resistance among
these isolates.

The percentage of IPD cases caused by serotype 19A increased from 10
percent of all cases during 2001-2002 to 41 percent during 2005-2006.
Of the 19A strains tested, 65 percent were nonsusceptible to
penicillin. 15 percent were highly resistant to ceftriaxone (MIC
greater than 2 microgram/ml), a 1st-line antimicrobial used for
empiric bacterial meningitis treatment, 44 percent were resistant to
azithromycin, and 32 percent were resistant to
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. No significant trends in the
antimicrobial resistance of non-19A isolates were noted.

The findings indicated that, despite increases in incidence of
antimicrobial-nonsusceptible IPD, overall rates of IPD remained
stable during 2001-2006 and rates were approximately 70 percent lower
than the pre-PCV7 annual IPD incidence. In addition, the study found
no evidence that infections caused by antimicrobial-nonsusceptible
serotype 19A had different clinical syndromes or outcomes than
infections caused by antimicrobial-susceptible 19A. No significant
changes were noted in the proportions of IPD caused by other PCV7 or
PCV7-related serotypes or by non-PCV7 serogroups.

Wyeth, the pharmaceutical firm that manufactures Prevnar, in
commenting on the study above
(<http://medicalnewstoday.com/articles/84683.php>), noted that
serotype 19A is emerging globally in both regions where Prevnar is
available, as well as regions where it is not widely used, and an
increase in disease caused by 19A occurred in Korea even prior to the
introduction of Prevnar, perhaps representing emergence of an
antibiotic-resistant strain of a non-vaccine serotype due to overuse
of antibiotics, not vaccine use. - Mod.ML]
