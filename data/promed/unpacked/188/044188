Napalm used to fight food and mouth disease in Amur region
----------------------------------------------------------
Specialists trying to cope with an outbreak of the foot and mouth disease
(FMD) at a farm in Russia's Amur region have used napalm. 4 wooden cow
sheds were burned down on Saturday in the village of Sadovoye, sources from
the regional centre for emergency situations told Itar-Tass.
Brick premises of the farm were sealed after a 2nd disinfection, and access
to them has been denied. Specialists are yet to estimate the scope of the
damage. It is clear now that the figure of 30 million rubles, given
earlier, was much too low. The whole herd of cattle -- 940 head -- was
depopulated in Sadovoye. They were elite cattle, and it took specialists
several decades to breed them. After the animals were slaughtered, the
carcasses are being treated with a special solution and buried in the 6
metre deep gigantic cattle mortuary. According to veterinarians, new cattle
will be brought to the farm in Sadovoye not sooner than a year from now.
All measures have been taken to prevent the spread of the infection. Daily
checks at local markets show that no infected meat is on sale.

Scientists identify virus strain affecting cattle in Russia region
------------------------------------------------------------------
Studies of viral materials from Russia's Far Eastern region began at the
Vladimir Research Institute of Animal Protection on Thursday.
The institute's science deputy director Valery Zakharov told Itar-Tass that
the virus causing the FMD proved similar to the virus that afflicted cattle
in Britain in 2001, when more than 2000 infection sites were revealed, many
of which had been predicted by scientists, and more than 5 million head of
cattle had to be slaughtered.
The FMD virus recently has affected an elite cattle herd on a dairy farm in
Russia's Primorye region. More than 940 animals have been slaughtered.
Associates of the Vladimir institute went to the farm with 50 000 doses of
the vaccine for a nearby swine farm.

FMD in Amur
-----------
The FMD virus was probably introduced into the Amur territory from China,
according to specialists from the Amur Regional veterinary inspectorate.
According to them, mass infection of cattle in the Tambovskiy farm was
caused by the Pan-Asian type of virus.
At present, the principal eradication and control activities have been
completed on the affected farm. The landfill where the destroyed cattle
were buried is thoroughly secured. A quarantine is planned to be terminated
on 14 May 2004, or 21 days after the destruction of the last animal in the
affected flock. The police are blocking the entrances to the farm.

[Available data regarding the vaccination history of the affected farm,
particularly as related to the clinically affected 12 month old dairy
heifers, would be useful.
The FMD vaccine widely applied in Russia is an inactivated one -- in line
with the requirements in OIE's international Manual of Diagnostic Tests and
Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals. Data on the FMD vaccines currently in use
in China, with special reference to the vaccine strains and serotypes
included and the vaccine's quality assurance (safety and efficacy tests),
would be helpful.
It would be (epidemiologically) valuable to study the genetic profile of
the current Russian FMD virus strain compared to the strain identified
earlier in 2004 in Mongolia. In spite of serious suspicions of FMD in
sheep, the Chinese authorities denied cases in Inner Mongolia (see references).
The Chinese province bordering Amur is Heilongjiang. We wonder whether
details on FMD-related surveillance activities and vaccination figures
there could be provided. - Mod.AS]
