HEARTWATER, IMPORTED - USA (FLORIDA): TICKS WANTED
***********************************************
A ProMED-mail post
<http://www.promedmail.org>
[see: Heartwater, imported - USA (Florida): alert 20000105131456]
Date: Sat, 8 Jan 100 07:32:50 -0500
From: "Steve Grenard" <grenard@mail.con2.com>

P. Simmons of the University of Florida is requesting that tick specimens
be forwarded to him prepared as follows:
TICK ALERT - HELP STOP THE SPREAD OF HEARTWATER DISEASE
1) remove the tick with fine tweezers or forceps.
2) Grasp the tick firmly just behind the 'head' or the area that is
imbedded in the animal.
3) Pull straight out so as to include the 'head' area (This makes
identification much easier).
4) Kill the tick by placing it in a vial with 70% or 100% alcohol (such
as rubbing alcohol).
4) Send in the vial with the tick in alcohol -- any leak-proof vial will
do -- medicine vial, baby food jar, etc).
5) Please include all information on the host -- animal species, county
and state of animal's location, date the tick was removed, where the
tick was found on the host (eye, neck, etc.), where the animal was
imported from and how the animal relates to the owner (pet, retail store
owner, wholesaler, etc.).
The ticks should be mailed by standard mail to:
Petey Simmons
University of Florida
4602 Catalina Lane
Bonita Springs, Florida 34134
