White Garlic Rot has occurred in different plantings in Shandong province, [causing] fear that over half of new garlic crops will be affected. The weather in recent weeks has been relatively warm and humid, ideal conditions for the rot to spread.

"Consequences for this year's [2018] harvest can be grave. Farmers could lose up to half or even more of their total garlic crop. If a plant is affected with the rot, the plant will not sprout," says Steven Zhou of export company Bestway Group. "Plants affected by the rot will not be suitable for harvest." If the rot spreads across Shandong, [the] garlic price is set to rise.

[White rot caused by _Stromatinia cepivora_ (previously _Sclerotium cepivorum_) is considered the most severe disease of garlic and onions, but also affects other species in the genus _Allium_ (such as leeks, chives, shallots, ornamentals and weeds). Symptoms may include stunting of plants; leaf yellowing and dieback; as well as stem and bulb rot. Sclerotia (hard, protective survival structures) are formed on affected roots and can survive in the soil for many years without host plants.

The fungus is soil borne and spread by infected plant material (including seeds and seed bulbs), contaminated equipment, mechanical means and water. Disease management may include cultural and phytosanitary measures, including removal of crop residues and long crop rotations. Symptomless volunteer crop plants or weeds may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Fungicides are often of limited use for soil borne pathogens, but some chemicals or allium extracts are available that, when applied to contaminated soil, will "trick" sclerotia into germinating in the absence of a host which leads to the eventual death of the unprotected fungus. Use of certified clean planting material is essential. No white rot resistant garlic or onion cultivars are currently available.

Similar diseases called white moulds or rots on other crops may be caused by species previously classified under the genus _Sclerotium_ (for example, stem rot of rice, white mould of peanut), but many of these have now been reclassified and moved to other genera.
