UNDIAGNOSED ILLNESS - FIJI (02): REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

From: Irene LAI, MD <Irene.Lai@internationalsos.com>

The following information was obtained from a doctor in Fiji. Her reply was
received 30 Sep 2004, and I apologise in the delay in forwarding to you.
"Yes, there has indeed been an outbreak of ILI [influenza-like illness] in
Fiji for the past 4 weeks.The symptoms start with a sore throat,
rhinorrhea, cough, fever and progress to generalized myalgia. Some cases
also develop vomiting and diarrhea. Symptoms are not very severe, although
most patients require at least 2 or 3 days of bed rest with most cases
resolving in 8 to 10 days. We have seen on average 30 cases per day in our
clinic, and this number has for the past week reduced to about 15 to 20 per
day, which indicates a slowing pattern. Most require analgesics, throat
lozenges, and cough suppressants apart from increased fluids and avoiding
excessive sunlight to prevent further dehydration. A few need antibiotics,
if chest infection develops -- especially smokers and the
immunocompromised. The symptoms are very similar to Dengue fever, and we
have done serology on many specimens -- mostly negative but surprisingly 4
have come back positive for dengue serology. So we advise people of the
above measures and ask them to visit a doctors if symptoms do not get any
better within 72 hours.The public health system is straining to cope, and
it may be better for travellers to consult with GPs [general practitioners]
instead."

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr Lai for sharing this first hand
information from a physician in the International SOS network. As mentioned
above, dengue is one possible etiology, though it appears the majority of
specimens tested (without knowing exact numbers) were negative for evidence
of dengue virus infection. More information on further testing by reference
laboratories in the region would be appreciated. Perhaps our colleagues at
the Pacific Public Health Surveillance network can be of help. - Mod.MPP]
