Turkish Boy Tests Positive for Avian Influenza
-----------------------------------------------
A 5-year-old boy has tested positive for H5N1 avian influenza virus
in Turkey, according to the country's Health Ministry. The boy is in
serious condition in the hospital hours after his sister died in the
eastern city of Van. Initial tests suggested that the girl had not
died from the H5N1 strain.
Huseyin Avni Sahin, head physician at Van hospital, said the brother
and sister from the nearby town of Dogubayazit were admitted to the
hospital 5 days ago. Both children had been in contact with fowl and
apparently ate a chicken that had been shown sings of illness, Dr. Sahin said.
Dr. Ahmet Faik Oner said that the boy "has a fever, and the infection
in his lung is light; it's not advancing." The latest case brings the
total number of people who have tested positive for the H5N1 virus in
Turkey to 19. Authorities in the country are continuing to slaughter
thousands of birds as a precaution.

Turkey: Possible Avian Influenza Case Near Istanbul
-----------------------------------------------
A 5-year-old Turkish boy has been hospitalized in Istanbul with
suspected avian influenza, which has already killed 3 children in the
east of the country, the Anatolia news agency reported. If confirmed,
the boy would be the 1st case of H5N1 avian influenza near Turkey's
biggest city and commercial capital, in the far west bordering the
rest of Europe.
The boy, from the town of Gebze, around 100 km (60 miles) south of
Istanbul, had been in contact with chickens kept in the yard
surrounding his house, Anatolia reported.
Suffering from a high fever, he was brought 1st to a medical center
in Gebze for tests before being transferred to the hospital in
Istanbul on Saturday [14 Jan 2006]. In addition to the 3 other
children, all siblings, who died last week in the eastern city of
Van, 15 others have been infected. At least 3 of those have
recovered, according to Turkish press reports. The siblings were the
1st human casualties of the disease outside Southeast Asia and China,
where the disease has killed nearly 80 people since 2003.
