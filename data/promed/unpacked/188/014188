[1] CDC report
Date: Thu 4 Aug 2011
Source: CDC, _Salmonella_ homepage [edited]
http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/heidelberg/080411/index.html


CDC is collaborating with public health officials in many states and
the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service
(USDA-FSIS) to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella_
Heidelberg infections that is likely caused by eating ground turkey.
Public health investigators are using DNA "fingerprints" of
_Salmonella_ bacteria obtained through diagnostic testing with
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE, to identify cases of
illness that may be part of this outbreak. They are using data from
PulseNet, the national subtyping network made up of state and local
public health laboratories and federal food regulatory laboratories
that performs molecular surveillance of foodborne infections. The
outbreak strain of _S._ Heidelberg is resistant to several commonly
prescribed antibiotics; this antibiotic resistance can increase the
risk of hospitalization or possible treatment failure in infected
individuals.

A total of 78 persons infected with the outbreak strain have been
reported from 26 states between 1 Mar and 3 Aug 2011. The number of
ill persons identified in each state is as follows: AL (1), AZ (2), CA
(6), GA (2), IA (1), IL (7), IN (1), KY (2), LA (1), MA (1), MI (10),
MN (1), MO (2), MS (1), NC (1), NE (2), NV (1), NY (2), OH (10), OK
(1), OR (1), PA (5), SD (3), TN (2), TX (9), and WI (3).

Among persons for whom information is available, illnesses began on or
after 9 Mar 2011. Ill persons range in age from less than 1 year to 88
years old, with a median age of 23 years old. 52 percent are male.
Among the 60 ill persons with available information, 22 (37 percent)
have been hospitalized. One death has been reported.

Collaborative investigative efforts of state, local, and federal
public health and regulatory agencies indicate that eating ground
turkey is the likely source of this outbreak. Among the 54 ill persons
with available information, 28 (52 percent) reported consuming ground
turkey. This proportion is significantly higher than results from a
survey of healthy persons in which 11 percent of persons interviewed
reported consuming ground turkey in the 7 days before they were
interviewed. Product information (such as date and location of
purchase of ground turkey) is also being collected from ill persons
and is being used by local, state, and federal public health,
agriculture, and regulatory agencies to further the investigation.

Cultures of 4 ground turkey samples purchased from 4 retail locations
between 7 Mar 2011 and 27 Jun 2011, yielded the outbreak strain. PFGE
patterns from these _Salmonella_ that matched the outbreak strain were
added to the PulseNet database between 11 Apr 2011 and 12 Jul 2011,
approximately a month after each sample was collected.
Preliminary information indicates that all of these products
originated from a common production establishment. These were obtained
as part of routine sampling in the National Antimicrobial Resistance
Monitoring System (NARMS), and are not linked to illnesses.

This is a multi-drug resistant strain of _S._ Heidelberg. As of 4 Aug
2011, we have information on isolates from a sample of ground turkey
collected at retail and 9 ill persons with the outbreak strain of
_Salmonella_ Heidelberg. The isolate from the ground turkey sample is
resistant to antibiotics, including ampicillin, streptomycin,
tetracycline, and gentamicin. The sensitivity testing results to date
indicate that isolates from humans are also resistant to ampicillin,
streptomycin, and tetracycline, and some are resistant to
aminoglygosides, such as gentamicin; however, the testing is not
complete for all isolates. All human isolates are sensitive to several
common antibiotics that are used in clinical practice, such as
ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
Antibiotic resistance may increase the risk of hospitalization or
possible treatment failure in infected individuals.

A sample of leftover unlabeled frozen ground turkey was collected by a
public health agency from the home of a case-patient in Ohio who had
been confirmed to have the outbreak strain. Culture of the ground
turkey sample yielded the outbreak strain on 29 Jul 2011.

On that day, USDA-FSIS released a public health alert for frozen or
fresh ground turkey products. This alert reminds consumers of the
critical importance of following package cooking instructions for
frozen or fresh ground turkey products and general food safety
guidelines when handling and preparing any raw meat or poultry.

[As detailed in the initial FSIS report on this outbreak, even with
contaminated ground turkey, cooking to the appropriate temperature as
well as practicing the techniques of kitchen hygiene will prevent
illness. - Mod.LL]

[2] Recall
Date: Thu 4 Aug 2011

More than 36 million pounds of fresh and frozen ground turkey are
being voluntarily recalled by food giant Cargill because of the
possibility of salmonella contamination.

Health authorities say the poultry could be contaminated with
_Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Heidelberg, a strain of salmonella
that killed a California man and caused the illness of 79 others.

In one of the largest food recalls in the country, Cargill said that
the turkey was produced at the company's Springdale, Arkansas,
facility between 20 Feb 2011 and 2 Aug 2011. Production at the plant
has been suspended. "Given our concern for what has happened, and our
desire to do what is right for our consumers and customers, we are
voluntarily removing our ground turkey products from the marketplace,"
Steve Willardsen, president of Cargill's turkey processing business,
said in a statement. He also said that production of ground turkey
will not start up again at the plant "until the source can be
pinpointed and actions to address it are taken."

The USDA said an investigation "determined that there is a link
between the Cargill ground turkey products and the illness outbreak."
The recalled products have the number P-963 inside the USDA inspection
mark.

Earlier this week, California health officials confirmed that 1 person
in Sacramento County died, apparently in connection with eating
contaminated meat. County health officials declined to provide any
details about the victim or the circumstances.

Cargill owns 4 turkey processing facilities in the US, and no products
from the other 3 are involved in the recall, the company said.

[This, at 36 million pounds, is a huge recall. If we assume an average
frozen turkey weighs say 15 pounds and 50 percent of the weight is
meat, then with 7.5 pounds per turkey, the recall accounts for 4.8
million turkeys. - Mod.LL]
