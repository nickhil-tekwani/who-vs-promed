A mysterious outbreak of Legionnaires' disease has been linked to a suburban Illinois hospital. All 4 cases have been traced back to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) said on Thursday [27 Jun 2019]. Health officials say that 3 of those infected are former patients and one is a hospital worker.

According to the IDPH, the cases were 1st reported in 2018; 2 of the cases were reported from patients at the hospital within the past 2 months. Health officials will be visiting this hospital this week to collect water samples to test for bacteria.

Around 10 000 and 18 000 Americans are infected each year, with 300 of those being in Illinois. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in 10 people with the disease die.

The IDPH has opened an investigation, which is currently limited to Advocate Christ Medical Center. However, this is not the 1st time that the agency has investigated [a] hospital for Legionnaires' disease. An investigation was opened in March [2019] at the University of Chicago Medical Center after 2 patients contracted the infection, reported NBC Chicago. Then, in April [2019], the IDPH investigated after 2 patients were infected with Legionnaires' at Mercy Hospital and Medical Center in Chicago [ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - USA (06): (IL) hospital 20190428.6446054].

[Oak Lawn, with a population of 56 690 in 2010, is a suburb of Chicago, located southwest of the city in Cook County, Illinois (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Lawn,_Illinois). A map showing the location of Oak Lawn can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Oak+Lawn,+IL+60453. Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn is a general medical and surgical teaching hospital (https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/area/il/advocate-christ-medical-center-6432413).

_Legionella_ are gram-negative bacilli that are found in both natural freshwater environments, like lakes and streams, and in manufactured plumbing systems, such as showerheads and sink faucets, cooling towers, decorative fountains, hot tubs/spas, and hot water tanks and heaters. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 deg C [77-104 deg F] support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

Eradication of these bacteria from plumbing systems is often difficult. Long-term persistence within these water systems is favored by the intracellular location of _Legionella_ within several species of protozoa, where _Legionella_ replicate and which provide protection from environmental stressors, like biocides and heat treatment.

Also, the formation of biofilms allows adherence of _Legionella_ to the inner surfaces of the plumbing systems (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5835138/). _Legionella pneumophila_ have been shown to persist for long periods in biofilms in a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state after exposure to a biocide or heat treatment (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515819/). Monitoring _L. pneumophila_ in water systems that is usually done by culture would miss VBNC _Legionella_, which can be revived by the subsequent addition of ameba (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18839249).

Debilitated hospitalized patients who are prone to aspiration may develop Legionnaires' disease following aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water, as well as inhaling a fine spray (aerosols) from water sources containing _Legionella_. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described (Correia AM, Goncalves J, Gomes JP, et al. Probable person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med 2016;374(5):497-8. http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356).

During the epidemiological and environmental investigation for the source of _Legionella_ organisms, patients should be prohibited from taking showers and should consume only sterile water until the source has been remediated.

Genotyping the clinical isolates from cases of Legionnaires' disease will help to establish whether this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. However, if the diagnoses were confirmed through urine antigen testing, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping. The urine assay detects only _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen. - Mod.ML
