First Equine Case of West Nile Virus Reported in Palm Beach County
--------------------------------------------------
An infection of West Nile virus, the first case in Palm Beach County,
was confirmed on Fri 19 Oct 2001 in a horse in Royal Palm Beach, the
county Health Department said.
As of Fri 19 Oct 2001, sentinel flocks of chickens located throughout
the county continued to test negative for the virus, officials said.
Nevertheless, the Royal Palm Beach case confirms that the virus has
entered the county, health officials said.
Statewide, 11 human cases of West Nile virus have been reported this
year, and 49 of Florida's 67 counties remain under a medical alert for
heightened awareness for the disease's presence, according to the
state Department of Health.
In St. Lucie County, 6 chickens have tested positive in a preliminary
examination for the virus that can cause both the St. Louis and West
Nile illnesses, health officials said on Fri 19 Oct 2001. Additional
tests are being conducted. [This is interpreted to mean that in
preliminary tests the 6 sentinel birds have tested positive for
flavivirus antigen, suggesting that they may have been infected by
either St Louis encephalitis virus or
West Nile virus, related but distinguishable viruses that are
associated with similar but distinguishable illnesses. - Mod.CP

Third Horse with West Nile Virus Reported in Virginia
-----------------------------------------------------
A serology (blood) sample from a horse in the Suffolk area has tested
positive for West Nile virus (WNV). The Virginia Department of
Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) submitted the sample for
testing to the Division of Consolidated Laboratories (DCLS) in
Richmond. After a strong positive there, officials sent the sample to
the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa.
Because of the number of West Nile cases submitted for testing, VDACS
does not expect final confirmation for another week to 10 days but
says the presumptive positive from DCLS warrants a warning to the
public to protect their horses from mosquitoes, which transmit the
disease.
This is the third case of WNV in a horse in Virginia. The first 2 were
reported in September 2001. The 8-year-old horse, which appears to be
recovering from the infection, is from Suffolk, an area that often has
annual outbreaks of another mosquito-borne encephalitis virus, Eastern
Equine Encephalitis (EEE) virus. Both WNV and EEE virus are normally
maintained in the wild in birds and transferred from birds to animals
and humans by mosquitoes. A number of other diseases, among them
rabies, moldy corn poisoning, and equine protozoal myelitis, can
produce similar symptoms. Animal owners should consult their
veterinarians or the nearest VDACS Regional Animal Health Laboratory
if an animal exhibits any neurologic symptoms such as a stumbling
gait, facial paralysis, drooping, or disinterest in the surroundings.
