Influenza update - 339 (based on data up to 31 Mar 2019)
--------------------------------------------------------
Information in this report is categorized by influenza transmission zones, which are geographical groups of countries, areas or territories with similar influenza transmission patterns.

Summary
-------
In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere influenza activity decreased overall.

In North America, influenza activity appeared to decrease with influenza A(H3N2) the dominant virus, followed by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.

In Europe, influenza activity decreased across the continent. Both influenza A viruses co-circulated; influenza A(H3N2) was the most frequently identified subtype. In North Africa, influenza detections were low across reporting countries.

In Western Asia, influenza activity appeared to decrease overall, with exception of Saudi Arabia where activity remained elevated.

In East Asia, although decreased influenza activity continued to be reported. Influenza B was the most frequently detected virus followed by influenza A(H3N2).

In Southern Asia, influenza activity continued to decrease with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus predominating.
In the Caribbean, Central American countries, and the tropical countries of South America, influenza and RSV activity were low in general.

In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels, with the exception of some parts of Australia where influenza activity was above inter-seasonal levels. Worldwide, seasonal influenza A viruses accounted for the majority of detections.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 125 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 18 to 31 Mar 2019 (data as of 12 Apr 2019 03:15:47 UTC). The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 139 623 specimens during that time period. 30 960 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 25 464 (82.2 percent) were typed as influenza A and 5496 (17.8 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 4189 (40.6 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 6139 (59.4 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 154 (3.8 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 3919 (96.2 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Source of data
--------------
The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide and publishes an update every two weeks. The updates are based on available epidemiological and virological data sources, including FluNet (reported by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System), FluID (epidemiological data reported by national focal points) and influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member States. Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and quality of data available at the time when the update is developed.

The recent [influenza A(H1N1)] outbreak in Bumthang is under control with the number of infected people visiting hospital declining from 30 to 35 a day to about a dozen these days.

Since the 1st case was reported on [8 Apr 2019] about 227 people were reported to have been infected by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 causing seasonal flu.

Of the total infected, around 90 percent were students of Wangdicholing lower secondary school (WLSS), Bumthang. The 1st incident was reported on [8 Apr 2019] when 45 students did not come to school. Some were sent home and some referred to hospital.

Medical Officer of Wangdicholing hospital Dr Pema Wangchuk said the samples from the infected were sent to the Royal Center for Disease Control for investigation, which confirmed the disease as influenza A(H1N1). However, the doctor said it is a normal seasonal flu that occurs every year, especially during early spring and winter.

Signs and symptoms of influenza are fever, cough, headache, muscle and joint pains, sore throat and runny nose, sometimes with vomiting and diarrhoea.

Students are infected easily mainly because of congestion, lack of hand hygiene practice, and not having preventive measures for cough, according to health officials. The hospital organised advocacy and preventive measures to avoid further spreading of the disease.

As per the report from WLSS, about 64 infected students could not attend regular classes until [15 Apr 2019]. Although the number decreased, there are students not being able to attend classes while some teachers were also infected.

This is the 2nd consecutive outbreak. Last winter more than 350 people were infected by the same virus.

The current outbreak falls under the moderate category, where preventive measure and sensitization programme and treatment could work.

More than 1250 cases of [influenza A(H1N1)] and 98 deaths have been reported in Maharashtra from [1 Jan-14 Apr 2019]. Half the cases and deaths were reported only in March [2019].

The state's health department said there has been a spurt in H1N1 cases due to the climatic changes. Swine flu [influenza A(H1N1) virus], a respiratory infection, is caused by influenza viruses with symptoms such as cold, cough, and fever, which generally spreads rapidly during the winter.

Dr Pradip Awate, the state surveillance officer said the number of cases has shot up. "The highest number of [influenza A(H1N1) virus] deaths have been reported in Nashik [district in Maharashtra state]. The district reported 24 deaths, followed by Nagpur [district] with 16 deaths, Ahmednagar [district in the state] 12 deaths, and 8 deaths in Pune city," Dr Awate said.

Experts said the fluctuating temperatures and high humidity in March [2019] could have aided spreading the virus. "Minute changes in the temperature affect the transmission dynamics of a virus. When the temperature is low, the virus remains suspended in the air particles and leads to a rise in swine flu cases," said Abhay Chowdhary, the former director of the Parel [Mumbai]-based Haffkine Institute.

A whopping 815 000 people were screened for [influenza A(H1N1) virus] in state with 247 patients being admitted to hospitals. 8 patients are on the ventilators. Meanwhile, over 120 H1N1 cases have been reported in Mumbai [capital city of Maharashtra]. Civic officials attribute better surveillance to the reporting of more cases. Last year [2018], during the corresponding period, no cases were reported.

Dr Padmaja Keskar, executive health officer, urged people to avoid self-medication, and visit a doctor. "No special measures have been taken by us, neither are we conducting any awareness campaign on H1N1. Regular precautionary measures are being implemented to contain the number," added Dr Keskar.

Private practitioners in Mumbai also confirmed of treating rising H1N1 cases with 3 patients daily on average. Dr Om Srivastava an infectious diseases specialist, said, "I continue to see 2-3 new cases of H1N1 every week. There are more patients this year [2019]. Patients belonging to high-risk group are being put on Tamiflu immediately," said Dr Srivastava.

To prevent influenza transmission in the community, it is necessary to maintain respiratory and hand hygiene and stay at home during the illness Seeking treatment early in the course of the disease, particularly for individuals belonging to high-risk groups, can help to manage influenza-associated complications and reduce mortality. - Mod.UBA]
