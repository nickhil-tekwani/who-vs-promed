Health officials in the Dominican Republic have reported 19 tetanus cases so far this year [2021], which has resulted in 6 fatalities, according to epidemiological surveillance.

The Dominican Today reports the cases and deaths are in residents of the provinces of Santo Domingo, Santiago, and Independencia [https://dominicantoday.com/dr/local/2021/07/17/record-36-deaths-from-dengue-diphtheria-tetanus-and-leptospirosis/].

Tetanus is caused by a very potent toxin produced by the anaerobic bacterium, _Clostridium tetani_. The spores of this organism are very resistant to environmental factors and are found widely distributed in soil and in the intestines and feces of horses, sheep, cattle, dogs, cats, rats, guinea pigs, and chickens. Manure-treated soil may contain large numbers of spores. These spores are usually introduced into the body through a puncture wound contaminated with soil, street dust, animal bites, or animal or human feces, through lacerations, burns, or trivial unnoticed wounds, or by injecting contaminated drugs. At this point, the spores germinate into the bacteria, which multiply and produce the toxin.

Depending on the extent of the wound, the incubation of tetanus is around 10-14 days. Some of the common symptoms of tetanus are lockjaw, followed by stiffness of the neck, difficulty in swallowing, and rigidity of abdominal muscles. Other symptoms include elevated temperature, sweating, elevated blood pressure, and episodic rapid heart rate. Spasms may occur frequently and last for several minutes. Spasms continue for 3-4 weeks. The typical features of a tetanus spasm are the position opisthotonos and the facial expressions known as "risus sardonicus". The death rate for this disease ranges from 10-80% depending on age and quality of care.

This disease is not transmitted from person to person. Tetanus can be prevented through vaccination.

[Tetanus is an intoxication related to a local, usually wound, infection due to the vegetative form of _Clostridium tetani_, an anaerobic toxin-producing Gram-positive bacillus. The neurotoxin tetanospasmin blocks release of neurotransmitters (such as gamma-aminobutyric acid or GABA and glycine) from inhibitory neurons, leading to disinhibition of lower motor neurons (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3564069/). This results most classically in trismus (spasm of jaw muscles, causing the mouth to remain tightly closed), risus sardonicus (spasm of facial muscles, causing a sardonic grin), and opisthotonus (spam of back muscles, causing bending of the spine and extremities convexly forward, with the body resting on the head and the heels).

Tetanus is a vaccine-preventable disease. Having tetanus does not confer immunity to the disease. Immunization with tetanus toxoid will produce antitoxins that prevent the disease, but waning immunity and increased immigration of non-immunized or inadequately immunized individuals represent a significant cause of cases in developed nations (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00051456.htm).

Tetanus toxoid (T) vaccine is available combined with diphtheria toxoid, both in full-strength diphtheria toxoid doses (denoted by upper case letter "TD") in pediatric formulations and in reduced-strength diphtheria toxoid doses (denoted by upper case T and lowercase d, "Td") in adult formulations. These are combined with acellular or whole-cell pertussis antigens in full strength pediatric formulations (DTaP, DTwP) or in reduced strength in the adolescent/adult formulations (Tdap).

In the United States, a total of 5 DTaP doses are recommended to be given to children: one dose each at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, with booster doses at ages 15-18 months, and 4-6 years (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/schedules/child-schedule.htm). In the Dominican Republic, 3 doses of DTP are given to children. In 2018, 94% of children in the Dominican Republic received the 3 doses of DPT vaccine by 12 months of age or at any time before the survey (https://www.indexmundi.com/facts/dominican-republic/indicator/SH.IMM.IDPT). Booster doses of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids are recommended every 10 years throughout life.

We are not told in the news report above any patient characteristics. We are not told their vaccination status, if they had a wound infection that received inadequate prophylaxis, or if they were injection drug users. Heroin users, particularly those who inject heroin subcutaneously or intramuscularly, appear to be at high risk for tetanus (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC546055/). In newborns, tetanus (tetanus neonatorum) is a major cause of infant mortality in underdeveloped countries but is rare in the United States. Infection results from umbilical cord contamination during unsanitary delivery, coupled with a lack of maternal immunization. The risk for development of tetanus is highest in the elderly population, as a result of waning vaccine-induced immunity. - Mod.ML
