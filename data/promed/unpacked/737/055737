Poliovirus weekly update, 8 May 2019, World Health Organization
---------------------------------------------------------------
New wild poliovirus cases reported this week: 3
Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2019: 18
Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2018: 33

New cVDPV cases reported this week: 0
Total number of cVDPV cases (all types) in 2019: 9
Total number of cVDPV cases (all types) in 2018: 104

Headlines
- With recent introduction to the immunization coverage activities in Zimbabwe and Mongolia, at least 1 dose of Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) is now available worldwide in 126 countries. IPV consists of inactivated (killed) poliovirus strains of all 3 poliovirus types, producing antibodies in the blood to all types. In the event of infection, these antibodies prevent the spread of the virus to the central nervous system and protect against paralysis.

Summary of new viruses this week:
- Pakistan - 3 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases and 5 WPV1-positive environmental samples;
- Nigeria - 1 circulating vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2)-positive environmental sample; and,
- Niger - 1 cVDPV2 isolated from a healthy community.

Afghanistan
- No wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases have been reported in the past week. There are 7 WPV1 cases reported in 2019 from Afghanistan. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2018 remains 21.
- The Technical Advisory Group for polio eradication (TAG) met on [15-16 Jan 2019] to assess the progress made towards polio eradication in Afghanistan in 2018 and made recommendations for the way forward in 2019.

Pakistan
- 3 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases have been confirmed: 2 from Lahore district in Punjab province and 1 from Bannu district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The cases have onset of paralysis on [2, 17 and 19 Apr 2019], respectively.
- 5 WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week: 1 from DG Khan district and 1 from Multan district in Punjab province; 1 from Mardan district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province; 1 from Orangi Town in Karachi district, Sindh province; and 1 from Islamabad district in the Federal Capital Territory. The samples were collected between [8 and 18 Apr 2019]. So far in 2019, a total of 107 environmental positive samples have been reported. Full year 2018 total remains 140.

Nigeria
- No cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 have been reported in the past week. There are 7 cVDPV2 cases reported in 2019 so far. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 remains 34.
- 1 cVDPV2-positive environmental sample was reported this week in Ilorin south, Kwara State. The sample was collected on [10 Apr 2019].
- No case of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) has been reported in the country since the one detected from Borno State with a date of onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016].
- Recent confirmation of spread of 1 of the cVDPV2 outbreaks, both within Nigeria and internationally, underscores the urgent need to fill remaining vaccination gaps in the ongoing outbreak response, and to optimize the geographic extent and operational quality of mOPV2 response.
- At the same time, outbreak response to WPV1 continues, including efforts to address surveillance and immunity gaps in parts of Borno State.

Lake Chad Basin
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported in the past week. 1 cVDPV2 was isolated from a healthy community contact in Magaria, Zinder State. The sample was collected on [16 Mar 2019].
- The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 reported in Niger in 2018 is 10. The outbreak is genetically-linked to the cVDPV2 outbreak originating in Jigawa, Nigeria. Virus was isolated from children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) from Zinder region, located in the south of Niger and on the border with Nigeria, with dates of onset of paralysis ranging from [18 Jul 2018] through [5 Dec 2018].
- Acute flaccid paralysis surveillance and routine immunization across the country with focus on the infected provinces and the provinces at the international borders with Nigeria are being reinforced.
- Active case finding for additional AFP cases is continuing, and additional surveillance measures such as increasing the frequency and extent of environmental surveillance and community sampling of healthy individuals is being expanded.

Central Africa
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). So far, 1 cVDPV case has been reported in DRC in 2019. The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported in 2018 is 20.

[The 2 additional cases mentioned on the End Polio Pakistan website during this week have not as yet been included in the weekly global update. That being said, the global tally of WPV1 cases confirmed since 1 Jan 2019 is now at 18 - 7 in Afghanistan and 11 in Pakistan. The report of additional positive environmental samples in Pakistan, including in areas not recently confirming actual cases serves as confirming continued circulation of the WPV1 in the country.

While there have not been cases of cVDPV confirmed in the past week, the isolation of a cVDPV2 from a healthy contact in Niger confirms the continued circulation of the cVDPV in Niger, as well as in Kwara state Nigeria where there was a positive environmental sample.

[re: ProMED-mail Poliomyelitis update (33): Pakistan (KPTD, SD) follow-up on prev. conf case, RFI 20190508.6460248]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In response to a request for information sent to the EpiCore Surveillance Project members, we received the following information on this new case:

The patient is a 36-month-old child from Miran Ali in North Waziristan, who was diagnosed as having Guillan Barré Syndrome (GBS). The child did not have a history of any routine immunizations and it was questionable if the child had received OPV doses during the polio vaccination campaigns.

[We are very grateful to EpiCore Surveillance Project members for the rapid and very helpful reply to the request for information sent yesterday [8 May 2019].

GBS is a neurologic disorder resulting from the body having an immune response to its peripheral nervous system resulting in an ascending paralysis (starting in the feet and progressing upwards) accompanied by a loss of sensation. While its etiology is not fully understood, it is typically observed to occur several weeks following an upper respiratory or gastrointestinal infection. Paralysis resolves in the majority of cases.

A map showing the districts and provinces of Pakistan can be found at https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/pak215_pakistan_districts_v5_a0_20181203.pdf. Miran Ali is located in North Waziristan.

https://dunyanews.tv/en/Pakistan/490714-New-polio-case-surfaces-in-North-Waziristan


A new polio case surfaced in tribal district of North Waziristan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, raising the tally of polio cases to 13 across the country in the current year [2019], Dunya News reported on [Wed 8 May 2019]. According to Emergency Operation Centre, polio virus has been confirmed in a 3-year-old girl in North Waziristan.

Polio is a highly infectious disease that invades the nervous system and can cause irreversible paralysis in a matter of hours. It is now endemic in only 2 countries, Pakistan and Afghanistan [Nigeria has not as yet been declared polio free, with the date of onset of last WPV1 associated disease having been on 21 Aug 2016. - Mod.MPP]

Efforts to eliminate polio in Pakistan have became complicated in recent years, as polio workers have faced attacks by militants who say the health teams are Western spies, or that the vaccines they administer are intended to sterilize children.

Source: Urdu Point News [edited]
https://www.urdupoint.com/en/health/95-target-achieved-in-recent-polio-eradicati-617694.html


Parliamentary Secretary for National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination Dr. Nausheen Hamid has said that 95% coverage as well as target was achieved during the polio eradication campaign in April 2019. She stated this while responding to a Calling Attention Notice regarding increase in the number of polio cases in the country due to rise in refusal rate to administer polio vaccine to children.

She said that effective immunization campaigns are the only way to eradicate polio virus from the country. She said polio vaccination campaigns are launched to fully eradicate the disease from Pakistan. She added that a special campaign was launched in April [2019], while the similar initiative would be launched in next July [2019].

According to Dr. Nausheen Hamid, poliovirus continues to exist in sewage water in Pakistan causing eruption of this disease in various parts of the country. She said that unfortunately, some elements create hurdles in the way of effective polio eradication campaigns, adding that an exclusive social media cell has been established at her ministry to create awareness against polio.

Earlier, the Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs responded to another Calling Attention Notice regarding poor performance of cell phone towers in the country due to non-maintenance or service.

[Note that the nationwide polio vaccination campaign was held in the latter part of April 2019, and the recent cases (including the 2 additional cases not as yet mentioned in the weekly GPEI updates) all had dates of onset on or before this vaccination campaign. Time will tell if the 95% coverage was sufficient to interrupt transmission of the WPV1 in Pakistan. It would be very unfortunate if the 5% estimated to have been missed in this latest campaign were clustered in close proximity, thereby presenting pockets of susceptibles that could support continued circulation of the wild poliovirus. - Mod.MPP]
