Legionnaire's warning issued after 8th case
-----------------------------------------------
The discovery last week [3rd week August 2005] of an 8th case of
Legionnaire's disease in Rapid City prompted South Dakota health officials
to alert every state health department in the nation.
The discovery came only a few days after an estimated 500 000 motorcyclists
attended the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. Lisa Weyer, director of the Sturgis
Rally Department, said this year's [2005] rally took place without them
knowing anything about the Rapid City outbreak.
The 1st Rapid City case was in May 2005. The 1st time most South Dakotans
heard about the outbreak was in early August 2005. Doneen Hollingsworth,
state Health department secretary, said South Dakota's public health
officials decide on a case-by-case basis how to proceed in case of an
outbreak. She said the disease is not contagious, and there's nothing
people can do to prevent it.
Officials say 8 Rapid City residents -- 3 women and 5 men, ages 51 to 85 --
have been diagnosed with Legionnaire's disease this summer [2005]. Lon
Kightlinger, state epidemiologist, said the victims fit the disease
profile. Some are smokers, and some have underlying health conditions, he said.
South Dakota's earlier decision not to issue a public alert is similar to
what several neighboring states say they would have done and is in line
with policies of CDC. Jennifer Marcone, a CDC spokeswoman, said there are
no firm national guidelines concerning public notification. She said South
Dakota health officials did a thorough case control study, and no
definitive source of the disease was found.
