According to the Yantai City Disease Control Center, the number of
infectious diseases reported in Yantai [Shandong Province] continues to
fall steadily. But there has been a rise in the number rabies cases.

For the 9 years following 1998, Yantai City reported no locally-acquired
rabies cases. With the keeping of pets becoming more and more popular after
2007, there has been much trading and exchange of animals between cities.
Yentai began to report rabies occasionally, resulting in an expansion of
affected areas.

In addition, the rat population has increased, resulting in increases of
[hantaviral] hemorrhagic fevers. Although cases of AIDS and tuberculosis
are falling, they may increase in the future. Experts warn that people must
continue to protect themselves from infectious diseases.

[Further information on measures being taken to control the spread of urban
rabies in Yantai city and Shandong province, such as the policy regarding
vaccination of household pets, would be welcomed.
