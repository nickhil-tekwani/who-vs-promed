A 5th-grade science experiment made 50 students sick in Jun 2006, the
Massachusetts Department of Public Health said yesterday, 6 Jul 2006. The
students were asked to dissect owl pellets, a form of feces [incorrect --
see moderator comments - Mod.LL], at Jefferson Elementary School. According
to DPH spokeswoman Donna Rheaume, 28 were infected with salmonella
bacteria, while another 22 reported experiencing nausea, diarrhea, or
stomach pains following the experiment.
Because of the outbreak, the state plans to update its guidelines for
handling the pellets for the upcoming 2006-7 school year, Rheaume
said. The new DPH guidelines will instruct teachers and students to wear
protective gloves and to wash their hands and work areas following the
experiments, Rheaume said.
The DPH launched its investigation 16 Jun 2006, when several Jefferson
5th-graders were diagnosed with the bacterial infection. Since then, the
number of confirmed cases jumped from 6 to 11 to 23, and now, to 28. The
number of cases was expected to rise as the children's physicians reported
the infections to the state, Rheaume said.
The owl pellets were said to be the cause of the outbreak yesterday, 6 Jul
2006, after samples were collected and analyzed at a state laboratory in
Boston. Cafeteria food was quickly ruled out as the culprit because the
outbreak was mostly contained within the 5th grade, Rheaume said.
A similar 2005 salmonella outbreak in Minnesota was linked to owl pellets
when 40 students fell ill after dissecting them on a cafeteria table,
according to the Minnesota DPH's Acute Disease Investigation and Control
Section.

[The serotype of salmonella involved in this outbreak is still not stated
and would be of interest. The other potential source was a turtle tank,
certainly a more classical source of salmonellosis. Here, however, the
turtle was found innocent.
However, the guilty owl pellets, as noted in ProMED's previous postings
involving this cluster of cases, are not a form of feces. The following is
repeated from a previous moderation:
Like all birds, owls have no teeth to chew their food. Their food is
usually swallowed whole, or in large chunks. After an owl swallows a mouse,
strong acids in the owl's stomach begin to digest the mouse's muscle and
other soft parts. The owl can't digest the bones and fur that come along
with the meal, so the owl's stomach forms these indigestible materials into
tight packages called pellets. Several hours after a meal, an owl will
regurgitate one of these pellets. The pellets, along with feathers and
other remains, can be found under owl roosts.
