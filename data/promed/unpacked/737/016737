To date, 183 cases of illness due to _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection have
been reported to the CDC, including 29 cases of Hemolytic Uremic
Syndrome (HUS), 95 hospitalizations and one death.
States Affected; Canadian case identified: the 26 affected states
are: Arizona (7), California (1), Colorado (1), Connecticut (3) Idaho
(4), Illinois (1), Indiana (9), Kentucky (8), Maine (3), Maryland
(3), Michigan (4), Minnesota (2), Nebraska (9), Nevada (1), New
Mexico (5), New York (11), Ohio (24), Oregon (6), Pennsylvania (8),
Tennessee (1), Utah (18), Virginia (2), Washington (3), West Virginia
(1), Wisconsin (47), and Wyoming (1). In addition, Canada has
confirmed that one case of _E. coli_ O157:H7 has been positively
matched to the outbreak strain in a person who ate bagged spinach.

On 13 Sep 2006, CDC officials were alerted by epidemiologists in
Wisconsin and Oregon that fresh spinach was the suspected source of
small clusters of _Escherichia coli_ serotype O157:H7 infections in
those states. On the same day, New Mexico epidemiologists contacted
Wisconsin and Oregon epidemiologists about a cluster of _E. coli_
O157:H7 infections in New Mexico associated with fresh spinach
consumption. Wisconsin public health officials had 1st reported a
cluster of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infections to CDC on 8 Sep 2006.
On 12 Sep 2006, CDC PulseNet had confirmed that the _E. coli_ O157:H7
strains from infected patients in Wisconsin had matching pulsed-field
gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns and identified the same pattern
in patient isolates from other states. This report describes the
joint investigation and outbreak-control measures undertaken by state
public health officials, CDC, and the FDA. This investigation and
additional case finding are ongoing.
As of 26 Sep 2006, a total of 183 persons infected with the outbreak
strain of _E. coli_ O157:H7 had been reported to CDC from 26 states
(Figure 1 [for figure, see original URL. - Mod.LL]). Among the ill
persons, 95 (52 percent) were hospitalized, 29 (16 percent) had
hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), and one person died. The deaths of 2
other patients possibly related to this outbreak are under
investigation. 85 percent of patients reported illness onset from 19
Aug to 5 Sep 2006 (Figure 2 [for figure, see original URL. - Mod.LL]).
Fresh spinach was identified as the source of the outbreak. 123 of
130 patients (95 percent) reported consuming uncooked fresh spinach
during the 10 days before illness onset. In addition, _E. coli_
O157:H7 with a PFGE pattern matching the outbreak strain has been
isolated from 3 open packages of fresh spinach consumed by patients
(one from New Mexico, one from Utah, and one from Pennsylvania) [and
another one, suspect, from Illinois was noted in yesterday's (26 Sep
2006) ProMED post. - Mod.LL].
On 14 Sep 2006, FDA advised consumers by press release and press
conference to not eat bagged fresh spinach. On 15 Sep 2006, a
California company that bags spinach under several brand names
announced a voluntary recall of all fresh spinach-containing
products. On 16 Sep 2006, FDA expanded its warning and advised
consumers to not eat fresh spinach or fresh spinach-containing
products. On 21 Sep 2006, FDA informed consumers that only spinach
grown in 3 California counties (Monterey, San Benito, and Santa
Clara) was implicated in the outbreak.
A confirmed case is defined as a culture-confirmed _E. coli_ O157:H7
infection in a person residing in the USA, with illness onset from 1
Aug 2006 to the present (or, if date of onset is unknown, _E. coli_
O157:H7 isolated from 15 Aug 2006 to the present) and a PFGE pattern
identified by the XbaI restriction enzyme that matches the pattern of
the outbreak strain. 1 Aug 2006 was selected as the earliest illness
onset date in the case definition to ensure that the earliest cases
in the outbreak were identified and investigated. However, the 1st 6
confirmed cases (with illness onsets during 2-15 Aug 2006) were in
persons who did not report fresh spinach consumption during the week
before illness onset. The 1st date that illness onset was reported by
a person who recently consumed fresh spinach was 19 Aug 2006.
Infections with this outbreak strain of _E. coli_ O157:H7 (one of
3520 unique _E. coli_ O157:H7 strains reported to CDC PulseNet since
1996) have been reported sporadically to CDC PulseNet since 2003 (an
average of 21 cases per year during 2003-2005). This finding suggests
the occasional presence of this strain in the environment and food
supply; however, it has not been associated with a recognized
outbreak in the past.
The time from illness onset to confirmation that a case of _E. coli_
O157:H7 is part of an outbreak is typically 2-3 weeks, including the
time required for an infected person to seek medical care and for
health-care providers and public health officials to obtain a
culture, transfer the bacterial culture to a public health
laboratory, perform PFGE testing, and submit the PFGE pattern into
the national database at CDC. In this outbreak, the average time from
illness onset to PFGE pattern submission to the national database at
CDC has been 15 days; additional information is available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/foodborne/ecolispinach/reportingtimeline.htm>.
Parallel laboratory and epidemiologic investigations were crucial in
identifying the source of this outbreak. Timely PFGE testing by state
public health laboratories, PFGE pattern submission by states to CDC
PulseNet, and analysis of PFGE patterns in the CDC PulseNet national
database resulted in rapid detection of the outbreak. Concurrent
collection of case exposure information by epidemiologists in
affected states and sharing of exposure information among states and
CDC led to rapid identification of the suspected food source and
public health action. Continued rapid diagnosis, culture, PFGE
analysis, and reporting to CDC of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infections are
needed to aid this investigation and to detect and investigate _E.
coli_ O157:H7 outbreaks in the future.
New information regarding the current _E. coli_ O157:H7 outbreak will
be available regularly. The most current information is available online at
<http://www.cdc.gov/foodborne/ecolispinach>; this website contains
information updated daily on the number of cases and affected states
in addition to general information regarding _E. coli_ O157:H7,
resources for clinicians and activities by CDC and other agencies.
The FDA website, at
<http://www.fda.gov/oc/opacom/hottopics/spinach.html>, contains
advice for consumers on the current outbreak and food-safety
guidelines. CDC's public inquiry line (telephone, 1-800-CDC-INFO)
also can provide information on the current outbreak to both the
public and health-care workers. Information about the current _E.
coli_ O157:H7 outbreak is also available by RSS (Really Simple
Syndication); a subscription to the _E. coli_ O157:H7 outbreak RSS
information can be obtained at <http://www.bt.cdc.gov/rss>.

[It is interesting to note the previous presence of this PFGE type in
"background noise" of USA O157:H7 cases and that it has not before
been associated with a significant outbreak.
