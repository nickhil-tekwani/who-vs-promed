Idaho: Viral Meningitis Outbreak Total Reaches Thirty Seven
-----------------------------------------------------------
LEWISTON: Doctors in the Lewiston-Clarkston Valley have confirmed another
12 cases of viral meningitis. That brings the tally of people known to be
affected by the illness to 37. The outbreak began in mid-May.
North Central District Health Department epidemiologist Donna Anderson says
health authorities do not know what caused the outbreak, but anyone with
symptoms should call their doctor. Symptoms include fever, severe headache,
stiff neck, sensitivity to bright lights, drowsiness or confusion, nausea
and vomiting.
Viral meningitis involves inflammation of the tissues that cover the brain
and spinal cord. It's less serious than bacterial meningitis, which has the
same symptoms. Health officials say frequent hand washing is the best
defense against viral meningitis.

[Viral or "aseptic" memnigitis is usually associated with a variety of
enteroviral infections. Recovery is normally complete within a few weeks,
although there is a small risk of serious neurological damage in early
life. The hand-washing admonition suggests that enterovirus infection is
suspected. Aseptic meningitis may be associated also with mumps in
children, an occasional feature of genital infection with herpes simplex
virus type 2 in adults, a consequence of exposure to small rodents carrying
lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, or arbovirus infection. - Mod.CP]
