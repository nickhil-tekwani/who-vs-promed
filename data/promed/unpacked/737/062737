2 persons have allegedly died of anthrax in the past 4 days in Bandhugam
block. About 10 persons in Barlamunda village were afflicted with the
disease after consuming raw meat during a festival. In the absence of any
medical aid, 2 of them died. A team of doctors from Koraput rushed to the
spot and treated the affected persons.
Tribal people living in the Narayanpatna, Bandhugam and Bargi areas said
that the dreaded disease is spreading due to a lack of medical aid in their
villages. The doctors and other staff posted there do not attend to their
duties due to the Naxal menace [attacks by Maoist rebels - Copy Editor MSP].
Meanwhile, locals have demanded that the District Collector launch mobile
health teams in all the villages of Narayanpatna and Bandhugam to examine
all of the people ahead of the monsoon.
Although anthrax occurs in the tribal regions every year, little efforts
have been made by the administration to post doctors in the area. Tribal
people pointed out [that] doctors come from Koraput, which is 120 km away,
to treat the patients once the case is reported. Delay in attending the
patients has lead to deaths in several cases.
Admitting that 2 persons had died of anthrax, Koraput In-Charge CDMO K.
Reddy said a medical team has been monitoring the situation in the areas.

[Anthrax has long been an ongoing problem in Tamil Nadu for many of the
same disease control reasons plaguing the rest of India, and in the tribal
areas, medical care has not always been a government priority. This has not
been helped by unrest in some of these areas. This anthrax outbreak is
clearly but part of a larger problem in Tamil Nadu of, among other things,
inadequate medical and veterinary health care in rural areas. The good news
is that, when treated early, human anthrax responds well to antibiotics.
The bad news is that reactive livestock vaccination programs have little
medium term impact and are not consistently effective in the short term. -
