Is anyone in Malaysia considering that Nipah virus may have been around for
many years, just as Lassa Fever [occurred in West Africa for many years
before it was separated from other conditions and identified with its
present name ?
Maybe these antibodies reflect past infections which were asymptomatic or
attributed to other causes.
Are there stored sera from the past, from people or from other species,
which could be tested? Positive sera from the past might suggest different
reactions to present circumstances.

[We have no information that would answer these questions. However, given
that considerable brain power is being focussed on the Nipah virus problem,
in Malaysia, in the U.S., and in Australia, and that scientists from all
three countries are working on this problem, it is unimaginable that no
one would have considered these questions. Serum samples from pigs and
other animals likely are in a freezer somewhere. With all there is to do
at this time, it likely has been judged that these samples will still be
available later on. First there is an epidemic to control.
We already know that pigs were infected months before the present
epizoodemic was recognized as such. Given that the presence of antibody to
Nipah virus in pigs is being taken as evidence of recent/current infection
in Malaysia, finding that pigs (particularly asymptomatic pigs) had
antibody to Nipah virus some years ago would stir an even larger hornet's
nest. If anyone knows of a collection of pig serum samples from Malaysia
or from adjacent countries, please let us know and we will put you in
contact with the right people to test them. - Mod.CC
