Gastroenteritis Outbreak Attributed to Improper Hand-washing
------------------------------------------------------------
Improper hand-washing by a restaurant employee likely is to blame for the
illnesses of more than 100 people who ate at the Hob Nob restaurant in
Crystal Lake on Mon 18 Dec 2000 according to the McHenry County Department
of Health. An investigation by the department revealed that at least 114 of
the 180 people who ate at the restaurant on that night were infected with a
calicivirus, a type of virus which may cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
abdominal pain, muscle aches and fevers in its victims.
Health Department spokeswoman Barbara Yurgaitis said that [this type of
virus is spread from person-to-person through fecal-oral contact, and
[frequently this takes place when a person preparing or serving food
touches it without properly washing his or her hands first. "This is a
statistically significant incident because 63 percent of the people we
contacted reported an illness," she said. "It does not appear to be an
ongoing problem. Otherwise we would have closed the restaurant."
The Health Department is continuing its investigation of the Hob Nob
restaurant by scrutinizing employees and their food-handling [practices.
Yurgaitis said that if department investigators find any sanitation problems
or mishandling practices, changes would be demanded immediately or the
restaurant could be shut down. But she said no such violations have been
witnessed, so the Hob Nob has been allowed to remain open during the
investigation - which will likely continue for at least the next month.
The 114 people who reported illness after eating at the restaurant suffered
mild to moderate side effects of the virus infection, and none required
emergency hospitalization. A calicivirus infection was diagnosed after stool
specimens were analyzed by the Illinois Department of Public Health
laboratory.
The December food-borne illness outbreak at the Hob Nob is not its first. In
1998, 103 diners at the same restaurant became ill [after consuming fruit
salad and roast beef which was contaminated by a "Norwalk-like virus." In
that case, health department investigators had determined that an employee
at the restaurant didn't wash his hands properly before touching food served
to customers. The fact that the Hob Nob has had two incidents in as many
years is "striking," Yurgaitis said. The Hob Nob had score well, however, in
an annual inspection by the Health Department, achieving a score of 88 out
of a possible 100 points. The 12-point deduction was due to several minor
violations, which had been corrected.

[The faulty hand-washing verdict seems to rest solely on the result of
analysis of the previous outbreak at the same restaurant. The previous
investigation appears to have been more definitive, since the diagnosis of
"Norwalk-like virus" infection is more precise than "calicivirus" infection.
The "Norwalk-like viruses" are one of several types of calicivirus. The
family _Caliciviridae_ comprises 4 genera, of which the "Norwalk-like
viruses" are one. - Mod.CP
