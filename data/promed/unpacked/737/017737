Pending the availability of the on-line Hansard report of yesterday in the
House of Commons, here is a relevant account taken from today's Electronic
Telegraph.
MAFF Minister Dr Jack Cunningham has announced the public enquiry into BSE.
He stated that Lord Justice Phillips had been asked to investigate the
emergence and identification of BSE and the human equivalent,
Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease.
The inquiry will go back over events during the Callaghan, Thatcher and
Major governments, covering the period from when the disease was first
identified to March 1996, when the former administration announced a link
between eating infected beef and the new variant of CJD. It has been asked
to report within a year on the adequacy of the response by previous
governments "taking account of the state of knowledge at the time." It will
look at who knew what when, and whether the public was given enough warning.
Comment: "When the disease was first identified" was April 1985. However,
inclusion of reference to "the Callaghan government" would take the enquiry
back to include the late 1970s. Even that is not early enough. The enquiry
really should go back further to include the early 1960s, to cover the
period when changes to rendering practices
actually began. - JRB.
