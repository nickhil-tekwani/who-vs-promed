The Federal Center for Animal Health (Russian Federation), which is a center of the International Epizoodics Bureau for cooperation in the field of diagnosis and control of animal diseases in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Caucasus, confirmed the diagnosis of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) established earlier in Belarusian laboratories on the Vostochnyi farm, BelTA has learned from the veterinary and food supervision department of the Agriculture and Food Ministry of Belarus.

As reported earlier, on 26 Apr 2013 the Chief State Veterinary Inspector for Baranovichi District informed the department about the abortions of breeding sows on the Vostochnyi farm. "In order to determine the causes, the department sent a team composed of its experts and specialists of the Begosvettsentr veterinary center and Vyshelessky State Academy of Veterinary Medicine of Vitebsk. Experts conducted a full examination onsite and selected samples for laboratory tests," the department reported.

According to the department, national laboratories did the tests and found "no dangerous infectious disease in animals." Samples have been sent to the reference laboratory of the International Epizoodics Bureau (the Russian Federation) for additional studies.

"The Federal Center for Animal Health confirmed the PRRS virus spotted by the national laboratories," the department said. At present, the state veterinary service is taking all necessary measures to prevent and liquidate the disease.

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, also known as blue-ear pig disease, is a virus that causes reproductive failure in breeding stock and tract illness in young pigs.

[The information regarding PRRS in the farm reportedly suspected by media sources (and Ukraine's Veterinary Services) to be an outbreak of African swine fever (ASF) can be seen as addressing ProMED-mail's request for information (see posting 20130507.1697138) and apparently rules out ASF.

A highly pathogenic subtype 3 PRRS virus (coined "Lena"), which differs from European subtype 1 Lelystad and North American US5 strains at both the genetic and antigenic level, was isolated in Belarus in the late 2000s. During an experimental infection trial, severe clinical signs developed, and 4 out of 10 inoculated pigs died (see in posting 20101016.3744).

Additional information on PRRS and its diagnosis is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.08.07_PRRS.pdf.

It will be a relief if even the slightest possibility of mixed infection with ASF has been definitely ruled out by the laboratory. - Mod.AS
