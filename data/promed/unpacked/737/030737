First Report of _Rhizoctonia oryzae_ on Pea.
T. C. Paulitz, USDA-ARS, Root Disease and Biological Control Laboratory,
Washington State University, Pullman 99164-6430. Plant Dis. 86:442, 2002;
published on-line as D-2002-0219-04N, 2002. Accepted for publication 6 Feb
2002.
In May 2001, severe stunting, lateral rot, and brown discoloration of
taproots were observed in a field of direct-seed (no-till) pea [_Pisum
sativum_]cv. Columbia southeast of Lewiston, ID. The field had been
previously cropped with direct-seeded spring barley.
Roots were washed, plated on water agar containing benomyl at 1
microgram/ml and chloramphenicol at 100 microgram/ml, and incubated at 22
degrees C. Fungal colonies were identified as _Rhizoctonia oryzae_ [Ro]
(teleomorph _Waitea circinata_ Warcup & Talbot) based on hyphal and colony
morphology (3) and anastamosis reaction with known tester isolates. 2
isolates were grown on autoclaved oat seeds for 3 weeks to produce inoculum
for pathogenicity testing. 1 colonized oat seed was placed below a seed of
_P.sativum_ 'Little Marvel' planted in pasteurized sandy loam soil. There
were 5 pea seeds per 10-cm-diameter pot and 3 replicate pots per isolate.
Both isolates caused severe damping-off and stunting. [They] ... were also
tested in nonpasteurized (natural) sandy loam in 4 cm x 20 cm plastic pine
seedling tubes. 8 colonized oat seeds were placed in a band 1 cm below a
single pea seed planted in each tube. Tubes were watered with metalaxyl
(0.1g/liter, technical grade) to inhibit _Pythium_. Control treatments
consisted of soil amended with either autoclaved oat seeds or nothing.
2 isolates of Ro ... were tested with 2 pea cultivars (B160 and
Marjorette), with 5 replicates per treatment. Ro ... did not significantly
reduce emergence but did cause necrosis and browning of root tips and
reduction in lateral root formation. Ro ... was reisolated from infected roots.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of Ro ... causing disease on a
dicot[yledon] in North America. In Australia, a _Waitea_ sp. was weakly
virulent to subterranean clover producing constrictions of the taproot but
did not affect plant survival and growth (4). _W. circinata_ also caused
damping-off of tobacco seedlings in India (2).
In the [U.S.] Pacific Northwest, peas are often grown in rotation with
wheat and barley, and Ro can be virulent on these cereal crops (1). This
finding may have important implications for disease management in wheat and
legumes in crop rotation systems.

leguminous species. - Mod.DH]
