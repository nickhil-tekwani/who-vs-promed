Ticks are active during spring, summer, and autumn in Sweden. Although so far this year [2022] only a few TBE [tick-borne encephalitis] cases have been reported, it is high time for people who will be staying in risk areas to take a stand on vaccination before this year's [2022] tick season. This is in accordance with the recommendations from the regions' infection control units.

The cases of TBE are now reported from Gavle municipality and southwards and have gradually spread westwards. In 2021, the incidence increased in virtually all regions. Therefore, it is important to take a position on vaccination according to the regional recommendations that exist where you plan to be, says department head Britta Bjorkholm.

A total of 533 cases of TBE were reported in 2021. This is the highest number of cases at national level reported in Sweden. Compared with the previous year [2020], this is a doubling. Most cases were reported in September, and the majority became infected in Sweden.

The large increase in 2021 is probably due to several different factors, such as
- an increase in the small-rodent population during the year 2020, i.e., forest voles and forest mice;
- favorable weather conditions for ticks and humans to meet each other outdoors;
- the pandemic, as it may also have contributed to more people staying out in the wild than usual and risking being bitten by ticks.

Ticks usually thrive in grass and shrub vegetation, especially where it is humid. They are active during spring, summer, and autumn. As ticks often take quite a long time to choose a suitable bite site, the following advice can reduce the risk of being bitten by a tick:

- Check the skin and clothing regularly to detect and remove any ticks.
- Inspect your entire body after staying in the tick area.
- Full-coverage clothing partially protects against tick bites.

[The tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) transmission season has already begun in Sweden this year (2022). Although no mention is made in this report of the abundance of rodent reservoir hosts, tick populations, or prevalence of TBEV in them, health authorities are proposing consideration of vaccination recommendations. As noted in the 6 Jul 2021 post (ProMED post 20210706.8497934), the increase in cases in 2021 was reportedly due to climatic conditions favorable to tick vectors and lack of the usual vaccination of people frequenting tick habitats (see Tick-borne encephalitis - Sweden, 202120210706.8497934). It is not clear if those same factors apply this year (2022). Even without a certain forecast of TBE risk for this transmission season, vaccination and avoidance of tick bites are reliable preventive measures should 2022 be as active a transmission season as 2021 was.

An additional TBE risk was detected in July 2016 when an invasive tick, the taiga tick, _Ixodes persulcatus_, was found in 9 out of 36 field localities in the Bothnian Bay area in Sweden (see Invasive tick - Sweden: (Bothnian Bay) 20160718.4351669). The taiga tick can spread a more dangerous far eastern form of the TBE virus, which can have a mortality rate of up to 30%. The 6 Jul 2021 report does not mention whether any taiga ticks were transmitting TBE virus last year (2021). With the real possibility of additional introduction of this tick into Sweden, there is the risk that the more virulent virus will come with it as well.

Although the arrival of the taiga tick is of concern, the good news so far is that there is no indication that far eastern TBE subtype virus has arrived with it. In the meantime, the taiga tick very likely will expand its range in the country, as the previous report above indicates. Intensification of surveillance of both tick and virus would be prudent. - Mod.TY
