WHITE NOSE SYNDROME, BATS - USA (12)

It is a reasonable suggestion to attempt to feed starving animals;
however, there are some significant hurdles to overcome. After 8
years of providing rehabilitation for insectivorous bats and
maintaining a captive education collection coupled with the 20 years
of experience of my parent organization, I'm confident that there is
a significant learning curve for some species and some individuals to
recognize non-flighted insects as prey. Some bats come into rehab and
need to be taught that larvae are food that can be retrieved from an
unnatural source, like a dish. Other bats quickly learn on their own
or from observing other bats. While _Myotis lucifugus_ [little brown
bat, a bat that is suffering much loss from white nose syndrome (WNS)
- Mod.TG] appears to be one of the "fast learners," the ability of
rarer species such as _Myotis sodalist_ [Indiana bat],
_septentrionalis_[northern long eared bat], or _leibii_[eastern small
footed bat] to learn to self feed has not been established, as so few
of these species come into rehabilitation or are held in captive
research collections.

We do know that with proper re-hydration and re-feeding, WNS-affected
bats do survive in rehabilitation. However, most have severely
damaged wings and will never fly again. Whether the damage is from
fungal colonization or from exposure, we can't say at this time, but
we suspect the latter exacerbates the former. In fact, rehabilitated
bats that were recovered from cave interiors showed less permanent
wing damage and had 100 percent survivorship, in contrast to those
recovered after exiting caves, which had or developed irreparable
wing damage and either died or were euthanized. However, those were
very few bats; no in-depth diagnostic work was performed on the
casualties (because no one knew what to look for at the time), and no
similar studies have since been attempted. It would be interesting to
see whether providing affected bats with sufficient nutrition early
in the progression of WNS halted the wing damage.

Finally, the US bait industry is becoming increasingly unreliable,
especially during winter months when these bats need supplemental
feeding. In the last 2 years, mealworm shortages have forced
rehabilitation facilities and zoos to pay up to USD 20 per thousand
mealworms. It takes 10-15 thousand mealworms per month to feed
approximately 20 bats, and mealworms are not easy to rear in bulk.
Currently, my supplier is charging USD 4 per thousand before
shipping, and waxworms are significantly more expensive. Feeding
several thousand starving bats is probably not feasible from either a
cost or supply standpoint.

[ProMED-mail appreciates the insights shared by Bat World NOVA.
Although on some scales, feeding the bats is problematic, it may also
be a solution to assisting them. It would be interesting, as
mentioned above, to know whether providing nutrition early on in the
syndrome decreased wing damage and increased survivability. It may
provide some clue as to the cause/effect of this fungus. - Mod.TG]
