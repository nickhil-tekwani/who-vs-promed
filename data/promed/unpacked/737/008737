Cholera in the Americas - Situation summary
-----------
Since the beginning of 2015 up to epidemiological week (EW) 30 of 2015, a total of 20 388 cases have been recorded in 3 countries in the Region of the Americas: Haiti (20 043 cases), the Dominican Republic (344 cases) and Cuba (1 case). To date, no cholera cases have been reported in Mexico in 2015.

The last confirmed case of cholera in Cuba was reported in January 2015 by the Canada International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point, indicating the case was an individual with history of travel to Cuba.

In the Dominican Republic, since the beginning of the epidemic (November 2010) to EW 28 of 2015, a total of 32 764 suspected cholera cases, including 489 deaths, were recorded. Between EW 1 and EW 28 of 2015, 344 suspected cholera cases were registered, including 11 deaths. This represents the double of the cases recorded for the same period in 2014. This situation in the Dominican Republic is linked to the cholera trends registered in Haiti during the same period.

In Haiti, since the beginning of the epidemic (October 2010) through 25 July 2015, there were 744 698 cholera cases, of which 426 884 were hospitalized (57 percent cumulative hospitalization rate), and 8826 deaths, with a national cumulative case fatality rate of 1.4 percent.
From January 2015 up to 25 Jul 2015 (EW 30), there were 20 043 cholera cases, including 15 921 hospitalizations (79 percent hospitalization rate), and 171 deaths (case fatality rate of 0.7 percent). In 2015, the number of cases and deaths recorded by epidemiological week show an increase in comparison to the corresponding week in 2014. In addition, in some weeks of 2015, the number of cases recorded is greater than what was recorded in 2012.

[ProMED has noted 2 cases of cholera that were acquired in Cuba in travelers returning to Italy and the UK during 2015 (Public Health Agency of Canada: Travel Health Notice: Cholera in Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti and Mexico. Updated 20 Mar 2015; http://phac-aspc.gc.ca/tmp-pmv/notices-avis/notices-avis-eng.php?id=111; Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (24): Americas 20150703.3480336). These were not reported from Cuba to PAHO.

Additionally in Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update (24): Americas: 20150703.3480336, a cholera case was reported in the Mexican state of Sonora, but it is unclear what is known about the Sonoran isolate regarding whether it is a O1 (or O139). Non-O1, non-O139 _V. cholerae_ does occur along the coasts of USA and Mexico, generally (but not always) causing milder illness without the epidemic potential - Mod.LL]

Cholera kills 4 in Tanzania
----------------
The number of people killed by cholera in Tanzania's commercial capital Dar es Salaam rose from 1 to 4 on Mon 17 Aug 2015, said medical authorities. Kinondoni municipal health authorities also said the number of cholera patients admitted to hospitals increased from 6 as of that day. The medical authorities said they were trying to establish the source of the outbreak of the deadly disease.

Musa Naty, the Kinondoni municipal director, confirmed that 4 patients were diagnosed with cholera after samples of their stools tested positive for the bacterial infection."They will be transferred to a special treatment camp located in Mburahati ward," said Naty. He said public health authorities have embarked on preventive measures to contain the potentially deadly waterborne disease.

Naty said that a team of health workers had started fumigating some of the hotspot areas in Kinondoni municipal."We want to ensure that we control the epidemic before it spreads further. We are treating the patients [who have] symptoms of the disease but the aim is to prevent it," he said.

2 isolation wards have been established at Sinza and Mwananyamala hospitals as reports of new patients continued to be recorded.

[3] Cholera - South Sudan
Date: Thu 13 Aug 2015

As the battle against cholera outbreak continues in South Sudan, the WHO and its partners are boosting assistance to help children and the most vulnerable prevent and reduce the spread of further cases. "Cholera is a largely preventable and treatable disease," said Allan
Mpairwe, Head of Outbreaks and Disasters Management at WHO in South Sudan. In fact, with early detection, effective case management and oral rehydration salts treatment, up to 80 per cent of the cases can be successfully treated while the fatality rate can be reduced to less than 1 percent.

"Progress is being made in providing access to safe water and sanitation for all populations and improving access to health care service for those who are sick," said Mr. Mpairwe.

WHO and partners such as the UN Children"s Fund (UNICEF) and the state Ministry of Health are strengthening the prevention and treatment of cholera for all at-risk populations, such as children, pregnant women, elderly people and those needing special attention. For example, the UN agency has launched health education campaigns, while considering local culture and beliefs, to promote simple but effective rules of good hygiene, safe water and food preparation. Training health workers, intensifying surveillance activities and strengthening referral systems have also been carried out. Meanwhile, WHO and MSF Swiss are assisting the state Ministry of Health for a vaccination campaign with oral cholera vaccine, targeting cholera transmission hotspots and vulnerable groups in Juba County.

Cholera cases have been declining since 20 Jul 2015. However, the threat to young children and other vulnerable groups remains high in South Sudan, unless all at-risk households have access to water, sanitation and hygiene. As of 10 Aug 2015, a total of 1519 cholera cases have been reported since June 2015 with children under 5 and 5-9 years of age being most affected in Juba and Bor counties.

[4] Diarrhea - Zimbabwe
Date: Wed 19 Aug 2015

https://www.newsday.co.zw/2015/08/19/water-shortages-fuel-typhoid/


Nearly 300 000 cases of diarrheal disease have been reported since the beginning of 2015 and 323 deaths recorded in the same period, a weekly disease surveillance report from the Ministry of Health has revealed. The report indicated that 60 percent of the victims were children under 5 years of age. Erratic water supplies have seen many people resorting to unclean water sources which are a breeding ground for waterborne diseases like typhoid and dysentery.

Harare City Council's director of health services Prosper Chonzi told NewsDay that they had noted an increase in diarrheal cases at most council clinics. "People are not getting water 24 hours and even though the situation has slightly improved, the shortages are still unacceptable," said the director. Chonzi also said most of these cases were being recorded from new resettlements like Hopley and Hatcliffe Extension which did not have access to proper sanitation.

"In most of these areas there are no ablution facilities and people use pit latrines while others use the bush toilet," he said. He also said the situation was worse in rural areas where 34 percent of the people had no access to toilets.

[5] Cholera - India (Chandigarh)
Date: Wed 12 Aug 2015

http://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/seven-of-23-water-samples-from-cholera-hit-manimajra-fail-test/article1-1379041.aspx


The real culprit behind the cholera outbreak in Manimajra is contaminated water; this was revealed by the health department after examination of water samples. According to director of health services, Chandigarh, Dr VK Gagneja, as many as 7 out of 23 water samples collected from the area have failed the bacteriological test. He said the hydrogen sulfide test, which is a bacteriological examination, was performed on the samples and it was found that the water was unfit for human consumption. He said they have also informed the MC [municipal corporation] officials about the test reports.

City mayor Poonam Sharma on Tuesday visited Manimajra hospital to take stock of the situation and meet the patients. The mayor said that she that she will also visit New Indira Colony and other parts of Manimajra along with MC officials on Wednesday morning, 12 Aug 2015, to check the water supply lines and water disposal lines in the area. She further instructed the water supply officials to supply water only through tankers to the affected areas in Manimajra. She said the MC will extend all kinds of help to the cholera patients.

The MC officials had on Monday, 10 Aug 2015, claimed that the samples they had collected from the area were found fit for human consumption. When contacted, MC superintending engineer NP Sharma said, "We had taken samples from our water pipelines, but those were found fit for human consumption. We have also increased the quantity of chlorine in the water. The samples that failed must have been taken from the victims' houses." However, the health officials said the MC doesn't conduct bacteriological studies of water. This study helps to [detect] the bacterium in the water that causes cholera.

4 fresh cases of cholera were reported on Tuesday, 11 Aug 2015, with total number of cases reaching 12. Apart from cholera, around 50 cases of mild/severe diarrhea were also reported. The health department's door-to-door survey, in which people suffering from mild diarrhoea are being treated on the spot, continued even on Tuesday.

[6] Cholera - Nepal (Katmandu)

20 cases of cholera were detected recently in the capital, a figure that could increase with the arrival of heavy rains associated with the monsoon season, a medical source revealed today, 17 Aug 2015. After several tests, 20 cases were confirmed as reported to The Himalayan Times by the director of the Division of Disease Control and Epidemiology of the Department of Health in Kathmandu, Dr. Baburam Marasini.

Contaminated water is the main cause of the spread of the disease. We advise the population to maintain adequate sanitation and hygiene
to prevent an outbreak, he warned. We can prevent a pandemic if we boil water, highlighted Marasini. He explained that patients were admitted to various hospitals, where they receive appropriate treatment.

With the arrival of the monsoon, the Kathmandu Valley is increasingly vulnerable to cholera, a virulent disease caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium _Vibrio cholerae, reported The Himalayan Times.

International organizations like the UN and national experts warned of an outbreak of cholera and other infectious diseases as a result of
earthquakes on 25 Apr 2015 and 12 May 2015 that left nearly 8900 dead.
