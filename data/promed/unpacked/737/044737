Officials say 5 villages in Hakkari's Yuksekova district have been placed
under quarantine in fear of anthrax outbreak after loss of 80 livestock.
The District Agriculture Director is warning locals against contracting the
disease. The Agricultural Director of Yuksekova district in the Southeast
province of Hakkari has ordered a 15-day quarantine on 4 local villages and
a hamlet to contain a possible anthrax outbreak and asked villagers to take
measures against contracting the disease.
Director Mehmet Bilgin said the quarantine was imposed after reports of
loss of 30 small [sheep and goats] and 50 large livestock [cattle] and that
it would be in effect for 2 weeks until all of the animals have been
vaccinated. Bilgin said the required vaccine had arrived from capital
Ankara and that the vaccination had started. The municipality, he added, is
burying the dead animals.
The chieftain of the Gurdere villages where [the livestock were] lost,
Tahir Duzce, said they had been aware of the spread for 15 days but
measures had only been taken in the past week.

[This problem had certainly existed for more that 15 days, if 4 villages
and a hamlet were involved. To find this area, go to:

Turkey regularly reports outbreaks involving large and small ruminants. The
disease is very common in Turkey, especially in eastern Turkey. Human cases
have been reported for many years and latterly the not atypical numbers
are: 1999 (690), 2000 (396), 2001 (532), 2002 (368), 2003 (325). - Mod.MHJ]
