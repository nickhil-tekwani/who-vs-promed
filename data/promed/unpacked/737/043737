Anthrax -- Argentina: Azul (Buenos Aires) bovine case
-----------------------------------------------------
A natural outbreak of anthrax has occurred in the Alert and Response Zone in the Partido of Azul, Province of Buenos Aires, which has suffered some 81 outbreaks during 1989-2012.

On 4 Mar 2013 _Bacillus anthracis_ was recovered from a foot long 30.5 cm] bone [metacarpal or metatarsal. - Mod.MHJ] of a bovine which had died suddenly. This outbreak is near Estacion Show (in "Equal Risk zone No. 5"). The herd consists of 80 cross-bred cows of various British breeds and their calves. 2 cows were found dead with blood extravasation from natural body openings; scavenging birds had already taken their eyes. [Chimangos' or caracaras (_Milvago chimango_). - Mod.MHJ]

The zone has been suffering drought but with rain showers just before this outbreak; during the autumn and winter of 2012 there had been flooding during a couple of months. The herd had not been vaccinated as this zone is subject to voluntary vaccination. The carcasses have been handled in the standard "tapado controlado" method; that is, spraying the carcass with 5 per cent formaldehyde, then covering with a thick weighted/pinned down plastic tarp, to be left for 9 months when the remaining bones and hide are recovered and burnt.

[Yet again an unvaccinated herd in a known area of risk. Logically these "voluntary" zones need to be reconsidered and a more proactive policy of aggressive extension outreach implemented, such as we see successfully achieved in the Canadian prairie provinces and in North Dakota, to ensure that the maximum number of herds get vaccinated. At the same time it is clear that our knowledge of what is happening in contaminated patches of soil needs to be revisited, and how to recognise them before we get outbreaks. Then we should be able to have truly effective control procedures.

As usual our thanks to Ramon for this report. To find Azul go to http://www.fallingrain.com/world/AR/01/Azul.html. - Mod.MHJ
