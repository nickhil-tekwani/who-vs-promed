Findings from 3 studies on the real-world use of rapid tests, known as lateral flow devices (LFDs), have confirmed their effectiveness under a variety of conditions, demonstrating the reliability and adaptability of these tests.

The 3 research papers, 2 of which have been published by the government today [7 Jul 2021] and one by Liverpool University yesterday [6 Jul 2021], analysed the use of LFDs in a variety of scenarios: against variants of concern; on patients with high or low viral loads; as part of mass testing campaigns; in the hands of inexperienced users; and with different types of swabs.

Alongside the phenomenal scale and breadth of the rollout of the vaccination programme, and the 'Hands, Face, Space' guidance, regular testing is a vital tool in stopping transmission as the country follows the roadmap and starts to reopen.

With around 1 in 3 people infected with COVID-19 never developing symptoms, asymptomatic testing allows us to swiftly spot those cases most likely to be infectious. Knowing our rapid tests are effective in identifying the Delta variant means everyone who is currently engaged in regular twice-weekly testing can be confident the test will detect what is now the most common strain in circulation.

UKHSA Chief Executive Dr Jenny Harries:

"The UK has now established itself as a powerful testing armoury. Millions of people have been taking lateral flow devices used every week to help us carefully reopen society."

"These rapid tests continue to play an integral role in helping us stay on top of this virus by quickly identifying positive cases that may have otherwise gone unnoticed. This enables us to take swift action, preventing asymptomatic cases from becoming outbreaks."

Analysis of the Innova LFDs and their ability to detect the Delta (B.1.617.2) and Alpha (B.1.1.7) variants of concern found there was no significant change in the sensitivity of the tests when identifying either variant. The government-commissioned research involved academics and scientists from Queen Mary University of London, Public Health England and the Nuffield Department of Medicine, at the University of Oxford. It drew upon real-world performance data from between 1 Apr and 2 Jun 2021 for the most commonly used brand of LFD in the UK. Real-world testing data from over 2000 cases of the Delta variant was used to investigate whether LFD tested positivity rates are significantly lower than PCR positivity rates in locations where prevalence of the Delta variant is high.

As new variants surface, standard laboratory-based surveillance and clinical surveillance in real world settings, covered by research like this, will be crucial to ensuring these rapid tests remain a useful tool in tracking COVID-19.

A 2nd study has analysed the efficacy of rapid tests under different testing conditions and varying patient viral loads by making a statistical comparison of a number of different LFD user evaluation studies. The government-commissioned research drew on 7 different user evaluation studies that included over 1500 people with positive LFD results from a total population of over 18 000, and 2 professional use studies from PHE.

Research found LFD testing is effective at identifying people with the virus when they are at their most infectious, and that these tests are effective when used regularly, with only a small change in effectiveness between experienced test users like professional laboratory scientists or nurses and inexperienced test users. For nasal-only swabs, the sensitivity at high viral loads was the same (88%) whether administered by experienced or inexperienced users.

In November 2020 the government launched a community testing pilot in Liverpool and the evaluation of the study has now been published. Drawing on testing data from 48 testing sites across the city from when the pilot first began, the evaluation study shows there was a clear public health value to mass testing campaigns. During the pilot, widespread community testing of asymptomatic individuals resulted in an estimated increase in case detection of 18% when compared to other areas where the pilot was not running. There was also a 21% reduction in cases up until mid-December when compared with other areas, after which time the surge in the Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant made meaningful comparisons difficult.

Regular, rapid testing is already well established for NHS and care home staff, and the government has also made twice-weekly testing using LFDs available to all. Anyone with symptoms should book a free test online or by phone. People can then go to a testing site or have a kit sent to their home. For those with no symptoms, they should visit their local authority's website for more information.

Widespread regular use of the rapid tests using the lateral flow device (LFD) are effective in controlling spread of the virus. They are sensitive to the variants tested and can be used with confidence, understanding they signify infectiousness. This approach using LFTs had been advocated for over 1 year by Dr. Michael Mina (Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health). - Mod.LK]

[2] COVID in youth
Date: Thu 8 Jul 2021
Source: Nature [edited]

On 21 Jun [2021], Israel's Ministry of Health recommended that all individuals aged 12-15 be vaccinated against COVID-19 -- making the nation one of the few that have so far approved vaccinations for younger adolescents. The decision came in response to a trend that many countries with high rates of vaccination are experiencing: an ever-increasing proportion of new infections are in younger age-groups (see "Trending younger" [to view graphic, see source URL; data are presented below]).

Israel's swift vaccination campaign -- which has now reached more than 85% of the adult population -- saw case numbers drop to around a dozen a day in early June [2021]. But later that month, cases began to rise to more than 100 a day, many of whom were under 16, leading the government to open up vaccinations to all teenagers.

The younger profile of cases is not surprising, says Ran Balicer, an epidemiologist at Israel's largest healthcare provider, Clalit Health Services, in Tel Aviv. But it highlights the possibility that subsequent waves of community spread could be driven by younger age-groups, especially in the presence of new, more transmissible variants.

Trending younger
Proportion of recent COVID cases in Israel by age-group:

Age (years) / Percentage of cases
---------------------------------
0-9 / 11.8%
10-19 / 39.6%
20-29 / 8.5%
30-39 / 6.8%
40-49 / 11.4%
50-59 / 8.2%
60-69 / 8%
70-79 / 4.6%
80-89 / 1%
90+ / 0.1%

It's a trend that's not restricted to Israel. In the United States and the United Kingdom, COVID-19 has "become a disease of the unvaccinated, who are predominantly young," says Joshua Goldstein, a demographer at the University of California, Berkeley.

This shift is occurring in many countries that vaccinated older people first and are now reaching high levels of vaccination in the adult population. It follows an earlier drop in age resulting from public-health measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among older people who are most at risk of severe disease, such as those in nursing homes, say researchers.

And the shift has brought fresh impetus to studies of transmission and disease in younger age-groups. To make better policy decisions, "it's becoming more and more important to understand the burden of disease among children and adolescents," says Karin Magnusson, an epidemiologist at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health in Oslo.

Magnusson has looked at the impact of COVID-19 in children on Norway's healthcare system. In a 5 Jun 2021 preprint (https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.02.21258211), she reported that although they didn't need specialist care, children often needed to see their doctor repeatedly for up to 6 months after contracting the virus.

Balicer is studying viral spread in multigenerational households in Israel. Beyond decisions about vaccinating children, the changing patterns of COVID-19 infection have also fuelled discussions about extending health measures such as mask wearing to adolescents and kids in Israel, he says.

"As the burden of cases shifts towards younger people, arguments for vaccinating adolescents will become slightly more compelling," agrees Nick Bundle, an epidemiologist at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in Stockholm. However, the overall risk of severe disease in children remains low, and in many countries that have observed the proportion of cases rising in younger age-groups, the total number of cases has fallen, he points out.

And countries also need to consider the global context, say researchers. "Are we really better off giving the vaccine to kids in rich countries than to older people [in less wealthy countries] where it might have a much bigger impact on people's lives?" says Jennie Lavine, who studies infectious-disease dynamics at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. "It seems hard for me to imagine a really good argument for that."

Although the downward shift in the average age of infections in countries with high COVID-19 vaccination rates is an interesting phenomenon, it might be short-lived, say some researchers. A few scenarios could shift the balance back, says Henrik Salje, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at the University of Cambridge, UK. Many countries could start to vaccinate younger people -- as Israel and the United States are already doing -- or new variants and waning immunity among older age-groups could make them freshly susceptible, he says.

COVID-19 could still become a disease of the young, says Bundle. "But how big a problem that is, is not a simple thing to respond to."
