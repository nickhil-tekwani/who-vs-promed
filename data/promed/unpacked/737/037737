One of the prisoners from Higuey Correctional Center who was referred to a medical center on Sat 5 Jan 2013 because of developing symptoms compatible with cholera, has died. According to our correspondent in La Romana, Hector de la Rosa, the victim was included in the 1st group of inmates referred to the medical on Saturday morning, 5 Jan 2013.

The information was confirmed by the Provincial Health Director, Jaime Andres Rodriguez, who declared that this situation has occurred because of overcrowding and poor hygiene conditions in the area where inmates are confined.

More than 20 inmates from Higuey Correctional Center were referred to Nuestra Senora de La Altagracia Hospital, as ordered by Jaime Rodriguez, Provincial Health Director, because of the re-occurrence of an outbreak of cholera in the same area where more than 3 inmates died some time ago.

Dr. Rodriguez said that the 1st 4 affected inmates who developed cholera and who were dehydrated, were referred to the hospital. These persons had been confined in a cell with space for 20 people, but where there were 146 inmates.

Severe overcrowding and lack of potable water for properly cleaning the only toilet available for the inmates has led to the occurrence of this outbreak. He also said that the inmates will be given every medication they may need.

The cell will be sterilized with water and chlorine to stop the spread of the disease to the rest of the correctional facility, where there is also an area for women, which is not [currently] overcrowded.
