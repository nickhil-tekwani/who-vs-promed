Sanitary Status of Argentina
-----------------------------
The OIE Scientific Commission for Animal Diseases, at its meeting held on
16, 17 and 22 May 2003, decided to approve the zone of Argentina situated
north of the 42nd parallel as "free from foot and mouth disease (FMD) with
vaccination" with effect from 7 Jul 2003 in accordance with the provisions
of the 2003 OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code, provided that Argentina
submits documentary evidence that no new case of FMD or FMD virus infection
occurs in Argentina between 21 May and 7 Jul 2003.
The Authorities of Argentina have now provided documentation to the effect
that no FMD or FMD virus infection has occurred in Argentina during the
period 21 May to 7 Jul 2003. The documentation has been evaluated by the
Bureau of the OIE Scientific Commission for Animal Diseases and found to be
satisfactory.
The zone of Argentina north of the 42nd parallel is therefore declared
"free from FMD with vaccination" with effect from 7 Jul 2003.
