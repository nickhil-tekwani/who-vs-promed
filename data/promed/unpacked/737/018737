Fusarium also becoming oat growers' problem
-------------------------------------------
Fusarium head blight [FHB], a fungal disease commonly linked to
barley and wheat, is "indeed a problem" in Canada's commercial oat
fields, a new study shows. "You don't see it in oats as you do in
barley or wheat, where the disease is quite obvious in-season," plant
pathologist Andy Tekauz said in a release from the Western Grains
Research Foundation (WGRF). "So the likely assumption in the past was
that oats weren't affected by fusarium."

The WGRF backed a 3-year project. Tekauz was able to demonstrate FHB
is "indeed a problem in commercial oat fields, with more than 75
percent of the fields surveyed annually affected." Out of the seed
taken from the sample fields, Tekauz said he could isolate fusarium
fungi from 10 to 15 percent. Fusarium can be found in most Manitoba
oat fields, he said, and it "tends to be more of a problem in the
eastern Prairies and becomes less of a problem as you move further
west."

Unlike wheat, however, in which "95 percent of the problem" is caused
by the species _F. graminearum_, infections in oats involve the same
4 species infecting barley crops: _F. graminearum_, _F. poae_, _F.
sporotrichioides_ and _F. avenaceum_, Tekauz said. "Their proportion
tends to change from year to year. So environment or other factors
play a role in determining what levels of these fungi will be found
on the seed."

Canadian oat varieties and breeding lines, plus material from
elsewhere, were then tested for genetic resistance. "Among Canadian
oats, there was variability in FHB resistance. We were also able to
identify genetic resistance in lines obtained from other countries,
particularly South America," Tekauz said. Looking for resistance to
FHB based on low accumulation of DON (deoxynivalenol, a mycotoxin) is
now a "goal and priority" in Canadian oat breeding programs, the WGRF
said. Generally, Tekauz said, oats tend to be more resistant than
barley or wheat to fusarium.

[Fusarium head blight (FHB; also called scab) on wheat is caused by
several fungal species originally classed into the genus _Fusarium_,
accounting for the common name of this disease. Current names of the
fungi mentioned above are _Gibberella zeae_ (previously _Fusarium
graminearum_), _Fusarium poae_, _Fusarium sporotrichioides_, and
_Gibberella avenacea_ (previously _Fusarium avenaceum_).

FHB causes yield losses of up to 45 percent in small grain crops and
reduces the grade of harvested grain. It may also contaminate the
grain with fungal toxins, for example DON (also called vomitoxin),
which can affect stock and may lead to reduced feed consumption or
feed refusal. The total crop may be lost if grain is rejected because
of toxin levels. Disease management includes timely fungicide
applications and crop varieties with reduced susceptibility.

The scab fungi decompose organic host matter remaining on the soil
surface. Minimum tillage practices, which are becoming more widely
used in cereal growing areas have contributed to the increase of
inoculum and scab emerged as an important disease of crop species
previously considered as non-hosts. In 1999 in the south of Brazil,
an FHB epidemic was reported for the 1st time on oats.
