On July 10th ProMED-mail posted information [first reference cited above
from a press release of the Westchester County, New York State (NYS)
Department of Health Report that a crow "tested positive" for West Nile
virus. The moderator commented that "the nature of the confirmatory test
referred to ............is unclear and needs clarification".
According to Ward Stone, pathologist at the Delmar Laboratory, New York
State Department of Environmental Conservation, the dead crow which had
been submitted on 22 Jun 2000 was barely fledged, indicating both that the
bird was recently infected and that the infection had occurred near the
area where the bird had been found in New Rochelle, NY.
Dead birds are submitted by the thousands to his lab which serves the
entire state. (According to their press release, Westchester County alone
has received 2254 reports of dead birds and has sent 332 to the NYS Health
Department). Preliminary Screening is done on the basis of physical and
pathological findings and species. Birds with unexplained weight loss,
hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and with necrotic patches in the myocardium,
are likely to be positive. Histological findings include patchy myositis,
gliosis and splenitis. Suspect birds are sent to the Wadsworth Laboratory,
NYS Department of Health. Only 100 birds per week can be tested. PCR is
done on brain, spleen, heart and kidney. Virus isolation is attempted from
PCR-positive specimens. Although positive results have been found in 13/55
of the species tested including mallard, kingfisher, and red-tailed hawks,
most of the positives have been crows (both American and fish) or blue
jays. House sparrows and pigeons seem to have mostly asymptomatic infection
and may produce antibodies that would make them useful sentinel species.
