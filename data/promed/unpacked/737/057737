The post about rotavirus from Robert LaBudde suggests that a decreased
vaccine effect statistic value in developing countries as compared to
developed countries could be due to intestinal interference. I think there
is a much more highly probable explanation. That is that the standard
vaccine efficacy statistic estimates a parameter in an all or none vaccine
model while the rotavirus vaccine conforms to a partial effects model. In
an all or none vaccine model the chance event that may lead to vaccine
failure occurs at the time of vaccination. One either gets a fully
protective effect at that time or no effect at all. In a partial effects
model, which is a far more realistic model for most vaccines, the chance
event occurs at the time of contact with infectious virus. At that time
the immune response has a chance of being overwhelmed and allowing
infection. If it does allow infection, however, it may decrease the
severity of infection.
When a partial effects vaccine is evaluated using a statistic that
estimates a meaningful parameter only for an all or none vaccine, one would
expect a much higher statistic value in a developed country than in a
country with high levels of enteric transmission. That is not because the
biology is different in those two countries. It is because the statistic
is not estimating the right parameter. That statistic provides a very
negatively biased estimate of the partial effects parameter for vaccines
when many contacts are made with infectious virus, which is certainly the
case for rotaviruses. More detailed explanation of this can be found in
chapters 7 and 8 of my course on Compartmental models. This can be found
on the web at
