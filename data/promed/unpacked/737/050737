The [Michigan] State Department of Agriculture says they are going to test more than 5000 Newaygo County steers and cows for Bovine Tuberculosis over the next 6 months. This comes a few weeks after a steer from a Newaygo County farm tested positive for bovine tuberculosis [TB].

Scientists believe it came into contact with an infected cow from Northeast Lower Michigan, where the disease has been a problem for a few decades. Monday night [27 Mar 2017] in Grant, veterinarians were telling farmers when and how their cattle would be tested to find out if any other animals are infected. "There are a number of reasons we do this," explained state veterinarian James Averill, DVM, PhD. "Number one, bovine tuberculosis is a public health disease of concern. It can be transferred from animals to humans. The disease also has economic impact to our cattle industry."

State investigators aren't sure how an infected animal from the Thumb area was brought to Newaygo County and passed the disease on to a steer. Rigorous testing is supposed to prevent movement of infected cattle. "Either [it, the disease or the animal] evaded the test, which is not a perfect test, or somehow [the animal] got exposed," says Dr Averill. "I think the most likely cause is it somehow evaded our testing."

State veterinarians are also asking hunters to bring deer to checkpoints for bovine TB testing. Dr Averill says deer and cattle can pass the infection to each other. "The disease is typically passed from nose to nose contact from one animal to another or it can be done indirectly through a common feed or water source," he explains.

The state is testing animals within a 3 mile [5 km] radius of the farm near Grant where the infected steer was discovered.

[Testing all the cattle in a county is not an easy task nor will it be quick. This will take several months, in all likelihood. If a reactor is found, it may only widen the search. - Mod.TG
