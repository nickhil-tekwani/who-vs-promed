Cases of hepatitis B & C reported in Moga villages
--------------------------------------------------
A number of cases of hepatitis B and C have been reported in some
villages of the Baghapurana and Nihalsinghwala sub-divisions of the
Moga district. The medical authorities have sprung into action
creating awareness among the masses besides launching a campaign
against quacks.

In the Baghapurana sub-division, as many as 142 patients have been
found infected with the deadly viruses of hepatitis B and C, sources
in the health department revealed. The worst affected villages include
Samadh Bhai, Samalsar, Marhi Mustafa and Patto Hira Singh. Such cases
have also been reported from 10 other villages in the area.

Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Amarjit Singh Sidhu, while talking to
The Tribune by phone, said the cause of infection is the use of
inadequately sterilised needles and syringes by unqualified medical
practitioners and intake of drugs through injections by drug addicts.
He emphasised the need to strengthen the routine surveillance system
and organise an education campaign targeting all the health care
workers including private practitioners. While appealing to the people
not to panic, he said there is nothing to worry as the hepatitis B and
hepatitis C infections could easily be treated in the initial stage by
taking adequate precautionary measures.

In reply to a question, the CMO said he would form a committee of
senior medical officers along with the drug inspector to conduct a
survey and take legal action against the quacks operating in the
far-flung areas of the district.

[Hepatitis B and hepatitis C are bloodborne viral infections easily
transmitted from person-to person via unsterilised or multiple-use
syringes. The number of individuals infected in these rather remote
rural communities is alarming and suggests medical malpractice by
local community doctors rather than as a result of transmission of
disease among drug addicts. While some forms of hepatitis C virus
infection respond to treatment with expensive drugs such as pegylated
interferon and ribavirin, the reassurance reportedly offered by the
chief medical officer appears to be inappropriate and the source of
the outbreak must be eradicated.
