A stray dog went on a biting spree, attacking 32 people here
[Nizamabad] on Saturday [1 Jan 2011] afternoon before it was killed by
municipal authorities. According to the authorities, the dog attacked
the people in Chandrasekharnagar Colony, Women's College area,
Subashnagar, Gung, Natraj theatre and Mirchi Compound area of the town
in the afternoon.

Those who were bitten by the dog were rushed to the district
headquarters' hospital and given anti-rabies vaccination. However, the
relatives of the patients alleged that the patients were administered
only the Abhaya rub (anti-rabies vaccine) and that a few of them, who
sustained deep injuries in the neck, face and chest, were told to
procure by themselves another vaccine [i.e. rabies immunoglobulin for
wound treatment].

While the patients complained that the [rabies immunoglobulin] cost up
to Rs 3000 [67 USD approx.], which they could not afford, the hospital
authorities said they were equipped only to deal with minor injuries
and that the serious cases should be given [rabies immunoglobulin] at
their own cost or taken to Hyderabad [the capital of Andra Pradesh].

Finally, district collector D Varaprasad intervened in the matter and
directed the hospital authorities to give [rabies immunoglobulin] to
the patients by purchasing it from outside. Based on the instruction,
the hospital staff promised the serious patients that they would be
administered [rabies immunoglobulin]

[Rabies immunoglobulin is used for the treatment of serious wounds in
conjunction with rabies vaccine. It is expensive to prepare and in
short supply globally. Furthermore, it is unlikely to be effective if
treatment is delayed, since it is intended to destroy rabies virus at
the site of injury before the virus is disseminated. To circumvent
some of the problems highlighted in this report, an anti-rabies virus
neutralising monoclonal antibody, which could be produced cheaply and
in quantity, is under active development in India but not yet available.
