Across Montana and North Dakota [see ProMED-mail post 20090907.3148],
more wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) is being reported this year
[2009] than has been seen for many years. Mary Burrows, Montana State
University [MSU], said wheat streak mosaic virus has been affecting
both winter wheat and spring wheat, even barley fields, across
northeast and central Montana.

Samples began coming to the diagnostic lab in July [2009] and have
continued to come in from across the state. Along with the WSMV
reports came additional confirmations of wheat mosaic virus and the
newly identified triticum mosaic virus. The virus "doesn't show up
until the warmer temperatures show up," said Burrows.

WSMV is transmitted by wheat curl mites. "There is no chemical
control for WSMV or the mite. Seed treatment and foliar acaricides
(pesticides for mites) have not proven to be effective," said
Burrows. Conditions are ripe for a wheat streak epidemic next summer
[2010] but there are things producers can do. By planting too early
in the fall, the winter wheat emerges while the mites are still
active in other green growth.

"Sawflies make the WSMV worse," said David Weaver, entomologist at
MSU. "When the wheat lodges [collapses] because of the sawflies,
there are a lot of wheat kernels on the ground that the producer
can't pick up. That causes a lot of volunteer wheat to grow and
volunteer wheat is a key component of the green bridges for WSMV."

Since WSMV moves with the mites, management is based on avoidance of
the mites, destruction of the green bridge, and temperature at time
of planting.

[_Wheat streak mosaic virus_ (WSMV; genus _Tritimovirus_) is
prevalent in North America, Russia, Eastern Europe, and has also been
reported from Australia and Argentina. It can infect wheat, maize
(some cultivars), barley, oats, and a number of grasses. Symptoms
include leaf yellowing and streaking and often occur in patches or on
the edges of a field. Heavy WSMV infection can cause complete crop
failure in wheat. The virus is spread by the wheat curl mite _Aceria
tulipae_. Infectious insects can be carried on air currents to new
fields. WSMV can also be mechanically transmitted and seed
transmitted at a low level in wheat. Control of the mite vector is
difficult (see above) but disease management may include cultural
practices and control of volunteer cereals and grassy weeds to
minimise inoculum.

_Soil-borne wheat mosaic virus_ (SBWMV; genus _Furovirus_) occurs in
many countries from various parts of the world. It causes one of the
few diseases of winter wheat that can destroy an entire crop of a
susceptible cultivar. Symptoms vary and may include mild green to
prominent yellow leaf mottling, rosetting, and moderate to severe
stunting of plants. SBWMV is transmitted by the soil-inhabiting
fungus _Polymyxa graminis_. The virus survives in soil and crop
residues protected by the fungus, and can be spread in contaminated
soil, by water, and mechanical means. It is not seed-transmitted.
Disease management relies mainly on use of resistant wheat cultivars.

Triticum mosaic virus (TriMV) is an as yet unclassified virus in the
family _Potyviridae_. It was discovered in 2006 in the USA in plants
showing leaf mosaic symptoms, which belonged to wheat cultivars
developed for their resistance to WSMV. It is spread by the wheat
curl mite and can also be transmitted mechanically. It has recently
been sequenced and it was concluded that it is significantly
divergent from other genera in the family and should be placed in the
newly proposed genus Susmovirus.
