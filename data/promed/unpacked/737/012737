More than 100 children have died in the province of Sindh in the south of Pakistan, after an outbreak of mumps was declared a month ago and today [10 Jan 2013] many experts attributed it to the poor vaccination policy of the authorities, which did not reach the necessary population to prevent the spread of the disease. "When there is a large group of unimmunized children it is very easy to see an outbreak such as this one," Dr Buttha Tariq, Unicef responsible for immunization in neighboring Punjab province, told EFE news agency, adding that mumps "is one of the most contagious diseases and it spreads very quickly."

"The outbreak was declared at the beginning of last month [December 2012]; just during that month about 90 children died, and in January [2013] we've had 14 deaths already," said Dr Suresh Kumar of the Sindh Provincial Health Ministry.

Kumar added that a vaccination campaign that aims to reach more than 3 million children aged between 6 months and 12 years was launched months ago, and he hopes the outbreak [will be contained] by immunisation and greater awareness of parents. Kumar, like other experts consulted, said that the affected area, close to the river Indus, has been badly hit by flooding in the past 3 years, which has worsened the living conditions of many households. "Many lost their homes and now live with other families crammed into small houses with limited resources, which is an ideal breeding ground for infections such as mumps," said Kumar.

A spokeswoman for the World Health Organization (WHO), Maryam Yunus, also recalled that child malnutrition is directly related to the risk of mumps virus infection and its effects are greater. "Many of the people displaced by the floods are malnourished," she said, adding that most deaths of affected children occur from complications such as pneumonia or diarrhea. "Pneumonia is the most common complication and that which causes most deaths," said Buttha.

The experts agreed that now it is important to focus on the treatment of those affected (in December there were at least 2500 cases, according to official figures) with antibiotics and vitamins to improve the immune system of sick children.

[Mumps is a viral illness caused by a paramyxovirus of the genus _Rubulavirus_. The classic symptoms of mumps include parotitis in about 50 percent of the cases, either unilateral or bilateral, which develops an average of 16 to 18 days after exposure. Swelling can also be seen in the submandibular and sublingual gland in a small percentage. Nonspecific symptoms including myalgia, anorexia, malaise, headache, and low-grade fever may precede parotitis by several days. As many as 40-50 percent of mumps infections are associated with nonspecific or primarily respiratory symptoms, particularly among children less than 5 years of age. Only 30-40 percent of mumps infections produce typical acute parotitis. In 15-20 percent of infections, cases are asymptomatic. The average incubation period for mumps is 16-18 days, with a range of 12-25 days. Fever may persist for 3-4 days and parotitis, when present, usually lasts 7-10 days. Persons with mumps are usually considered most infectious from 1-2 days before until 5 days after onset of parotitis. Outbreaks of mumps accompanied by high mortality are rare and not usually associated with outcomes such as pneumonia and gastroenteritis. Further information would be appreciated.

However, mumps can cause acquired sensorineural hearing loss in children; incidence is estimated at 1 in 20 000 cases. Mumps-associated encephalitis occurs in less than 2 per 100 000 cases and approximately 1 percent of encephalitis cases are fatal. Some complications of mumps are known to occur more frequently among adults than among children. Adults have a higher risk for mumps meningoencephalitis than children. In addition, orchitis occurs in up to 30-40 percent of cases in post pubertal males. Although it is frequently bilateral, it rarely causes sterility. Mastitis has been reported in as many as 31 percent of female patients older than 15 years who have mumps. Other rare complications of mumps are oophoritis and pancreatitis. Aseptic meningitis occurs in 10 percent of cases and is associated with a good prognosis. Although mumps infection in the 1st trimester of pregnancy may result in fetal loss, there is no evidence that mumps during pregnancy causes congenital malformations. The long-term effects of mumps virus infection such as paralysis, seizures, etc., are very rare.
