Anti-rabies vaccine in short supply
-----------------------------------
Government hospital borrows vaccine from nearby hospitals.

A few hospitals in the district [Ernakulam district, Kerala state] are facing erratic supply of rabies vaccine, though the district medical office claims there is no supply shortage.

However, anti-rabies immunoglobin injectibles -- a one-time medicine if the bite is severe and there is tissue damage -- are neither being supplied by government nor available in the market. Local hospitals do not stock anti-rabies immunoglobin injectibles, for which the people are directed to either medical college or the district general hospital. A retail drug dealer said the non-availability of injectibles in the market was due to the wrong implementation tactics of the government policy. The manufacturers were asked to make the injectibles available at half the price and didn't give the producers time to adapt. It led to a shortfall for nearly 2 months. "The medicine, priced at around INR 2500 a vial [about USD 41.58], has now started trickling into the market," said the retailer.

In Paravur government hospital, the anti-rabies vaccine stocks will be available only for 2 weeks. While the government supplies are erratic, the hospital manages to stock the medicine by borrowing it from other nearby hospitals. Since it is the main hospital in the coastal area covering a number of panchayats [traditional local government systems], people knock on the doors of this hospital for any animal bite.

However, the Kothamangalam government hospital that caters to the district's tribal population too, is well stocked. The hospital has stocks to cover for over 2 months. The hospital had been providing vaccines to Paravur hospital too. Since January this year [2014] to mid June [2014], over 2000 vials of vaccine have been used in Paravur. A vial has 5 doses.

With increasing numbers of dog bites along with other animal bites, health authorities are finding it hard to stock up the supplies. The local bodies too are clueless about how to contain the stray dog menace.

[Kerala is a long, narrow state on the western side of India's southernmost point; see: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/india_pol01.jpg.

That this newspaper has published this piece from Kochi, Kerala state, indicates a high level of local concern. And if they have used "over" 2000 vaccine vials to date, that would indicate that some very significant number of dog bitten persons have presented themselves for treatment against a perceived threat of rabies.

Because rabies is not a notifiable disease in India and there is no organized surveillance system of human or animal cases, the actual number of deaths may be much higher than the national estimate for 2004 of over 10 000 cases (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2244675/). WHO estimates it at 20 000 cases per year. Roughly 36 percent of the world's rabies deaths occur in India each year, most of those when children come into contact with infected dogs (http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/87/12/09-021209/en/).

Experts say that the main constraint to rabies elimination in India is the lack of coordination and the lack of a comprehensive national programme. They agree that since India shares borders with 6 countries that are all rabies endemic, it is essential that India's rabies control efforts are coordinated regionally. Other Asian countries, such as Sri Lanka and Thailand, have made progress by taking a nationally coordinated approach, but there are signs of improvement in India (http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/87/12/09-021209/en/). But logically, one must initiate effective control in internal states before mounting border controls unless the flow inwards is significant. Kerala clearly needs to get its veterinary act together to control and eradicate canine rabies. - Mod.MHJ
