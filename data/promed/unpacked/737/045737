With reference to the above posting the following references on
pertussis may be of interest to ProMed readers:
Hethcote HW. Simulations of pertussis epidemiology in the United
States: effects of adult booster vaccinations. Math Biosci 1999;
158:47-73. [This paper from the University of Iowa uses a computer
simulation of the effects of pertussis immunization schedules in
adults. The author concludes that his models suggest that a
once-per-decade pertussis booster would decrease the disease in
adults but would have only a modest effect on the incidence in young
children. - Mod.LL
van Boven M, de Melker HE, Schellekens JF, Kretzschmar M. Waning
immunity and sub-clinical infection in an epidemic model:
implications for pertussis in The Netherlands. Math Biosci 2000;
164:161-82. [This contribution analyzes outbreaks of pertussis in
Holland and suggests that the contribution of pertussis in adults to
outbreaks cannot be neglected. - Mod.LL
Codeco CT, Luz PM. Is pertussis actually reemerging? Insights from an
individual-based model. Cad Saude Publica 2001; 17:491-500. [In this
model of pertussis dynamics in a small population from Brazil, the
authors analyze a number of potential factors. - Mod.LL
Cordova SP, Gilles MT, Beers MY. The outbreak that had to happen:
Bordetella pertussis in north-west Western Australia in 1999. Commun
Dis Intell 2000; 24:375-79. [In analyzing an outbreak of pertussis in
a small town in Australia, the authors conclude that periodic
pertussis outbreaks can be inevitable given an incomplete vaccine
efficacy and waning immunity and urge the consideration of the
infection in anyone with a persistent cough regardless of age or
immunization status. - Mod.LL
Garcia-Corbeira P, Dal-Re R, Aguilar L, Garcia-de-Lomas J.
Seroepidemiology of Bordetella pertussis infections in the Spanish
population: a cross-sectional study. Vaccine 2000; 18:2173-76. [In
this seroepidemiological study from Spain, the increasing prevalence
of pertussis antibodies through adulthood suggested that pertussis
infection in Spanish adults may be common, suggesting the
consideration of the use of acellular pertussis vaccine boosters in
adults.- Mod.LL
