Two types of dry dog food have been recalled after 3 separate reports from pet owners indicated their pets were suffering from vitamin D toxicity as a result of eating the food. Natural Life Pet Products is voluntarily recalling Natural Life Chicken and Potato dry dog food in 8 states, and Nutrisca is voluntarily recalling its Chicken and Chickpea Dry Dog Food nationwide.

An investigation into the matter found that a formula error led to the products containing too much vitamin D, the recall page on the US Food and Drug Administration website stated. The specifics on which dry dog foods are being recalled are listed below:

- 17.5 lb [7.9 kg] Natural Life Chicken and Potato Dry Dog Food Bag (UPC: 0-12344-08175-1)
Bags affected have a "best by date" code of 4 Dec 2019 through 10 Aug 2020. The code can be found on the back or bottom of each bag. The affected dog food was distributed by the St Louis-based company to retail stores in Georgia, Florida, Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and California.
- 4 lb [1.8 kg] Nutrisca Chicken and Chickpea Dry Dog Food Bag (UPC: 8-84244-12495-7)
- 15 lb [6.8 kg] Nutrisca Chicken and Chickpea Dry Dog Food Bag (UPC: 8-84244-12795-8)
- 28 lb [12.7] Nutrisca Chicken and Chickpea Dry Dog Food Bag (UPC: 8-84244-12895-5)
Bags affected have a "best by date" code of 25 Feb 2020 through 13 Sep 2020. The dry dog food was distributed nationwide.

Too much vitamin D can negatively affect dogs. Clinical signs of vitamin D toxicity include vomiting, loss of appetite, increased thirst, increased urination, excessive drooling, and weight loss. It can also lead to renal dysfunction (problems with the kidneys).

If your dog has eaten any of these foods and is exhibiting the signs of vitamin D toxicity, you are urged to contact your veterinarian.

Consumers with more questions on either recall can contact Natural Life Pet Products at 1-888-279-9420, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. CST, Monday through Friday. The company can also be reached by email at <consumerservices@nutrisca.com>.

[There are 2 forms of vitamin D, and toxicity or poisoning occurs when a dog ingests too much or a toxic dose of the vitamin. One form is a plant-derived vitamin D2, and the other is an animal-derived vitamin D3 (also called cholecalciferol).

"Cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) is used both as a dietary supplement and a rodenticide. It appears to be toxic at a much lower dose when consumed in a bait form than when ingested as a technical-grade agent.

"Cholecalciferol toxicosis is characterized by hyperphosphatemia and hypercalcemia [increases in blood levels of phosphorus and calcium], leading to renal failure, cardiac abnormalities, hypertension, central nervous system depression, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy. The increased calcium and phosphorus can lead to calcification of soft tissue, notably the highly vascular areas of kidneys and lungs, as well as within the walls of the great blood vessels.

"Clinical signs generally develop within 18-36 hours of ingestion; initial signs can include depression, anorexia, polyuria, and polydipsia [increase in urination and drinking]. The serum phosphorus more commonly rises 1st, at about 12-24 hours after ingestion, with serum calcium levels rising within another 12-24 hours. Nausea, vomiting, hematemesis [vomiting blood], and depression are common as the clinical signs progress. It is important to obtain a baseline biochemistry profile as early as possible after the exposure, so that each animal can be monitored based on individual values.

"Ingestion of vitamin D3 at greater than 0.1 mg/kg may require decontamination (induction of emesis and administration of activated charcoal) and monitoring of serum calcium, phosphorus, and renal values. Emesis can be induced within 2 hours of exposure; different drugs are used in dogs versus those used in cats. Activated charcoal at 1-2 g/kg is an appropriate initial dose for decontamination, and a 2nd half dose after about 6-8 hours may be helpful. In addition, use of cholestyramine, a bile acid sequestrant, may be useful to decrease the body burden of vitamin D3.

"Once the biochemical values begin to increase, there are 2 approaches to management. The 1st is to promote calciuresis by administering normal (0.9%) saline at 2-3 times normal rates. Furosemide promotes calcium excretion but can also increase fluid loss (so hydration status should be monitored). Prednisolone can reduce bone resorption as well as decrease calcium absorption from the intestine. Treatment with a phosphate binder to decrease phosphorus absorption and feeding a diet low in calcium should also be considered."

Hopefully the affected animals will receive appropriate care and will recover. - Mod.TG
