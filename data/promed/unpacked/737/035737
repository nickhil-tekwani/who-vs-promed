Lassa fever in a UK soldier recently returned from Sierra Leone
--------------------------------------------------
A case of Lassa fever has been confirmed in a British soldier
returned from Sierra Leone, West Africa, it is reported in a press
release issued today by the Royal Free Hospital. The man, who became
ill on Thu 30 Jan 2003, is being cared for at a high-security
infectious diseases unit in London and is in a stable condition.
Since 1970, there have been at least 16 cases of Lassa fever imported
into Europe or North America; in none of these has onward
transmission to another person been reported.
From cases of person-to-person spread that have occurred in
developing countries, it is clear that people are only infectious
while symptoms are present or in the period of convalescence, and
then only through direct contact with bodily fluids. No such
transmission has occurred in the United Kingdom (UK). However, in
accordance with established guidelines in the UK, the patient is
being treated in a high-security infectious diseases unit. As a
precaution, close contacts of the patient including hospital staff
involved in the patient's care, and particularly those who have had
contact with the patient's bodily fluids, will be monitored by
occupational health staff and given advice about their level of risk,
which is low.
This follows a previous case in a British aid worker in Sierra Leone
(1), a case imported from Sierra Leone to the Netherlands (2), and 2
cases imported to Germany from Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire, all in 2000
(3).
