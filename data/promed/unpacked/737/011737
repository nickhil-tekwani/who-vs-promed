A new outbreak of screw worm in Taiz, Ibb and Dhamar governorates in
central Yemen has killed hundreds of livestock, particularly in Taiz's
Sharaab District, where half the estimated 40 000 population depend on
livestock for a living, local officials say.

Some 100-200 cows, sheep and goats died in the past 2 weeks in the villages
of Mahmadan, al-Aridha, al-Ahtoub, and Hajifa as a result of the outbreak,
Anwar Abdullah, a local councillor in Taiz, told IRIN on 28 Sep 2009.
Dozens of cattle had also died in southern parts of Ibb Governorate, he said.

"I have lost my camel and 7 sheep as vets didn't get to my village in
time," said Saleh Mohammed, a 75 year old herder from Ans District in
Dhamar Governorate who has 4 infected goats and one infected cow. "My
neighbour was given insecticide for his infected cow, but it didn't help
save its life."

The screw worm fly lays its eggs in a cut or open wound on a warm-blooded
animal. Maggots then feast off the living flesh, and can kill the animal if
the wound is not cleaned and treated with insecticide in time.

"We clean the scratch on the animal's body of maggots and blood and then
apply insecticides to kill any remaining eggs," Agriculture Ministry vet
Hani Merai said, adding: "Early intervention is recommended to save the
lives of infected animals."

Another treatment technique -- not yet tried in Yemen but successful in the
USA and other countries -- is called the sterile insect technique: millions
of male screw worm flies are bred and sterilized with radiation, then
released into the wild.

Mohammed said infected goats were not producing normal quantities of milk.
"It is also disgusting to slaughter an ailing ruminant and eat its meat,"
he said.

Most animals survive if treated promptly, said Mansoor al-Qadasi, the
government's chief vet, based in Sanaa. Last month [August 2009], vets were
dispatched to Taiz, Ibb, and Hajja governorates (the latter 150 km north
west of Sanaa) with free insecticides, al-Qadasi told IRIN. The animal
death toll in Hajja had been kept to about 20 thanks to prompt
intervention, Mansoor al-Qadasi added. Since the 1st screw worm outbreak in
2007, over 20 000 livestock had been affected, but there had been
relatively few deaths. "It takes more than a month for an infected animal
to die. Early interventions by our department are keeping deaths to a
minimum," he said.

Prompter reporting of the disease by herders could have saved scores of
cattle over the past few months, according to Taiz councillor Abdullah.
"The Ministry often learns of new outbreaks only after it is too late to do
anything about them," he said.

Screw worm outbreaks can jeopardize the livelihoods of farming communities,
said Agriculture Ministry officials. Livestock farming accounted for only
2.5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2008, according to deputy
minister of agriculture and irrigation Mohammed al-Ghashm, but it was an
important source of livelihood for about 30 per cent of rural residents who
make up 71 per cent of Yemen's 22 million people.

[The parasite in question is the "Old World screwworm" (OWS; _Chrysomya
bezziana_), an OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) "Multiple
species" listed disease. Background information is available in chapter
2.1.10 of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial
Animals at <http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/2008/pdf/2.01.10_SCREWW.pdf>.

Yemen's annual report to the OIE for 2007 included the following data,
pertaining to 12 outbreaks during the months July-December (no outbreaks
reported during the 1st semester of 2007 nor during 2006):

Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 9962 / 652 / 0 / 0 / 0
Sheep / 39 851 / 2501 / 0 / 0 / 0
Goats / 39 850 / 2500 / 0 / 0 / 0
Camelidae / 1992 / 125 / 0 / 0 / 0
Equidae / 3985 / 250 / 0 / 0 / 0
Dogs / 3986 / 251 / 0 / 0 / 0

The disease continued and intensified its spread in 2008, with 4977 new
outbreaks recorded during the period January-June. The following data were
included:

Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 19 180 / 336 / 8 / 0 / 0
Sheep / 387 734 / 11 116 / 272 / 0 / 0
Goats / 305 193 / 4369 / 107 / 0 / 0
Camelidae / 2798 / 245 / 0 / 0 / 0
Wild species / 21 106 / 2074 / 59 / 0 / 0

The disease was reported as present also during the 2nd half of 2008, but
no quantitative data were included. The spread of the parasite is
continuing during 2009 in spite of the control efforts, as described in
posting 20090112.0122.

Old World Screw Worm flies (_Chrysomya bezziana_) are obligate parasites of
warm-blooded animals, including humans. Obviously, it has evolved to become
a significant potential threat to animals and humans in the region.

The FAO, cooperatively with the Free University of Brussels, published in
March 2008 a paper by M Gilbert and J Slingenberg "Geospatial demarcation
of Old World Screwworm risk in the Middle East, an update," available at
<http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/home/documents/OWS_Report.pdf>. The paper
includes, among other things, the map "Distribution of predicted OWS risk
for livestock in the study area, based on eco-climatic suitability". The
discussion includes, among other things, the following: "The risk areas
identified include a few hotspots in southwest Iran, southwest Yemen, and
along the south coast of Oman. Suitable condition areas are also observed
in parts of Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, along the Nile valley in Egypt
and in relatively large areas of Eritrea, Ethiopia and Sudan. The
delineation or demarcation of these areas might be somewhat too
restrictive, given the much larger area that appears to be suitable on the
basis of temperature alone. Thus, it is very well possible that OWS may
locally persist also in parts of Saudi Arabia, several Gulf countries and
inland Oman. ... It remains that the areas in the Arabian peninsula
predicted as high risk areas call for special attention. Follow-up is
indicated in order to collect more data on OWS in high risk settings and
relate the local OWS risk to the corresponding eco-climatic setting. The
recent outbreaks in western parts of Yemen confirm that the OWS
distribution in the Middle East remains fluid." - Mod.AS]
