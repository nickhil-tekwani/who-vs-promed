Canterbury health officials are worried a near record number of cases of an
organism
that causes food poisoning may spark a major outbreak. Seventy eight cases
of _Campylobacter_ [food poisoning] have been reported in just seven days.
One source of Campylobacter, a debilitating stomach bug, is summer
barbecues. It is much more prevalent in summer when people cook outdoors.

[Additional information on this outbreak would be appreciated. A press
release dated 12 Jan 2000 on the New Zealand Ministry of Health website
<http://210.48.125.104/moh.nsf> indicates a 30% decrease in reported
_Campylobacter_ infections for 1999 as compared to 1998. It is unclear
whether the incident reported here will reverse that trend. - Mod.ES]
