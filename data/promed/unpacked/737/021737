Portugal has until now 242 registered cases of hepatitis A, in an outbreak that began in the beginning of the year [2017] and affects other European countries. The balance was made today [Mon 8 May 2017] by the general director of Health, Francisco George, at a press conference in Lisbon.

According to the head of the Viral Hepatitis Program of the General-Directorate for Health, 93 percent of cases occur in men and 57 percent have been confirmed via sexual intercourse.

Isabel Aldir also said that most situations (almost 90 percent) occur in people from 18 to 50 years, especially in people aged 18 to 39 years.

[The reported number of infections has more than doubled from 107 to 242 since the last report about 4 weeks ago on [Sun 2 Apr 2017].

Because of specific sexual practices, men who have sex with men (MSM) are known to have a higher risk of acquiring hepatitis A and, if not vaccinated in childhood, should be immunized if found to be anti-HAV negative.

The recommendations for HAV vaccination in susceptible adults from ACIP are:

Vaccinate any person seeking protection from hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection and people with any of the following indications:
- Men who have sex with men;
- people who use injection or non-injection illicit drugs;
- people working with HAV-infected primates or with HAV in a research laboratory setting;
- people with chronic liver disease and people who receive clotting factor concentrates;
- people traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A; and
- unvaccinated people who anticipate close personal contact (such as household or regular babysitting) with an international adoptee during the 1st 60 days after arrival in the United States from a country with high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A. The 1st dose of the 2-dose hepatitis A vaccine series should be administered as soon as adoption is planned, ideally 2 or more weeks before the arrival of the adoptee.

The HAV vaccination history of the cases is not stated. - Mod.LL
