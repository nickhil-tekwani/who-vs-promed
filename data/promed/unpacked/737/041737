Environment Canada has confirmed the first case of COVID-19 in an animal in Atlantic Canada. The federal agency says the virus was detected in a free-ranging white-tailed deer in the Saint John region of New Brunswick.

Environment Canada has reported 56 cases of COVID-19 involving animals, including 13 pets, 40 wild animals and 3 mink farms, in 6 different provinces since the start of the pandemic. Most cases have been reported in white-tailed deer and cats. A dog in Ontario and 3 mink farms in British Columbia have also been affected by the virus during the pandemic.

Environment Canada has broken down confirmed COVID-19 cases in animals by province in an online dashboard:
- British Columbia: 4 pets, 3 mink farms and 12 wild animals
- Saskatchewan: 4 wild animals
- Manitoba: 3 wild animals
- Ontario: 5 pets and 17 wild animals
- Quebec: 4 pets and 3 wild animals
- New Brunswick: 1 wild animal

While animals can be infected with COVID-19, Environment Canada noted it remains "largely a disease of human concern" that "typically spreads from human to human".

[White-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) is the cervid most widely distributed east of the Rocky mountains. The ACE2 receptor (where SARS-CoV-2 binds to enter the cell) of white-tailed deer is very similar to that of humans, and it was experimentally proven that after intranasal inoculation, deer become infected by SARS-CoV-2, shed the virus and transmit it to non-inoculated contact deer. Later on, many wild white-tailed deer populations across USA and Canada were found infected at high prevalences with several SARS-CoV-2 variants. These consistent findings strongly suggest that following introduction of SARS-CoV-2 from humans, transmission is occurring among deer in the wild at a rate which makes deer populations a suitable compartment where the virus may be maintained and evolve, and then perhaps spill back to humans or other animals as a new variant, as suggested recently by molecular evidence. - Mod.PMB
