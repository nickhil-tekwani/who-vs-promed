Four sambars have died at Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary deer park in the past 48 hours, triggering fears of a lethal anthrax infection that also affects humans.

While one sambar died in the small hours of today [26 Oct 2013], 3 breathed their last on 23 Oct 2013. Sensing danger, a team of vets from Chandil and Seraikela, along with sanctuary officials, sent blood samples of the carcasses today to Veterinary College, Kanke, in Ranchi, to confirm anthrax. The report is expected early next week.

There are 11 sambars and 35 spotted deer at the 10-hectare [24.7 acre] park in Makulakocha village, part of the sanctuary, a tourist attraction some 25 km [15.5 mi] off Jamshedpur.

Ranchi (wildlife division) DFO [divisional forest officer] Kamlesh Pandey said they suspected anthrax behind the fatalities. "But this can be confirmed only after a blood test," he added.

Carcasses of animals with active anthrax at the time of death being a source of infection, the 4 deer have been buried at a "depth of 8 ft [2.5 m] at a faraway place," Pandey said.

"Though anthrax has not been confirmed, we are aware of consequences. For safety of other animals and human population inside the sanctuary, a high level of hygiene is being maintained. Lime and neem in powder form have been sprinkled to prevent infections. Animals have been given antibiotic injections," he added.

Dalma range officer Mangal Kacchap said they requested the state government to supply anti-anthrax vaccines. "I have written to animal husbandry officers of East Singhbhum and Seraikela-Kharsawan to arrange vaccines. I have also requested them to conduct vaccination drives in villages to protect cattle. These are precautionary steps," he added.

[All that is clear is that 4 sambar deer are dead from an uncertain cause and blood samples have been submitted on the basis of suspicion of 'anthrax'. Sambar can die from a number of causes and clostridial infections are frequently confused with anthrax when there are acute deaths. Hopefully we will hear of the laboratory results shortly.
