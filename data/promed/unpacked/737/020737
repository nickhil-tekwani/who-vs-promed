The Martinsville Henry County SPCA is warning about possible distemper outbreak. Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) director Nicole Harris said they have had 5 cases of animals acting suspiciously since [Sat 18 Mar 2017] and a total of 15 in the last few months. In many cases, animals such as foxes, raccoons and skunks are walking up to people.

Pet owners are encouraged to take extra precautions as this disease is contagious. "Your canines especially your outside canines. The best thing I would suggest is keep them inside right now. Limit the exposure they have to outside," said Harris.

"It's alarming for the public. We want to get it out there right now we think it is distemper that's what we're thinking. Along with the vets, in the health department, the animals we have tested so far have all come back negative for rabies," said EC Stone, animal control officer with the Martinsville police department.

If you see a suspicious animal, call police and let them handle the situation. In the meantime, the SPCA is holding an emergency vaccine clinic on [Sat 8 Apr 2017] to provide vaccines at a low-cost for the community.

[Canine distemper virus is the pathogen most frequently causing outbreaks at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface. As distemper and rabies affect the central nervous system, they both cause behavior disorders. Distemper usually results in stumbling and lack of 'shyness', they can seem 'dumb' and/or 'friendly'. Animals showing the same signs might be rabid, but in this case distemper might be more likely as rabies tests turned out negative.

It is very important to make sure to keep the vaccination schemes of all dogs, cats and ferrets in the area up to date. - Mod.PMB
