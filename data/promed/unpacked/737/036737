The comment is perhaps too guarded. It should say that quarantine is not
an effective ..."
Also, the actions reported to have been taken are in violation of the
International Health Regulations. China can petition the Director General
of WHO to intercede.

Two truck drivers who drank infected water in the Chinese city of Dunnin
were hospitalized this week after they came home with cholera, health
officials reported August 2. The Primorye Emergencies Commission ordered
border guards to stop admitting Chinese citizens into Russia at the
Poltavka border crossing (close to Dunnin) until August 15. Health
officials will examine all Russians who return from that point and inspect
food cargoes. Gennady Murnachyov, director of the Vladivostok Anti-Plague
Laboratory, said that until now, cholera in Primorye has existed only in a
passive form that is sometimes found in the rivers, but can't cause disease
in humans. But the current risk is minimal. Only if a lot of sewage from
sick people gets into the water system can somebody get infected. He
dismissed the possibility of an epidemic in Primorye. "The fact that the
[cholera patient was isolated the very first day and the doctors revealed
all his contacts and examined them shows that everything is under control,"
he said. The last time a cholera epidemic hit Primorye was during World War
II.
The Pacific Division of the Federal Border Guards Service informed Primorye
authorities about the epidemics in some northeastern Chinese towns.
According to Murnachyov, Japan every year registers from 30 to 70 cases of
Chinese and other guest workers bringing cholera, depending on the
situation in the surrounding countries. "It is a normal work of doctors,
who are always on alert," he said. "First of all, tourists and other
travelers should take care of themselves and never drink water from suspect
sources," he recommended. "If they do get an intestinal infection with
diarrhea and vomiting, they should immediately go to a doctor." The
bacteria lives mainly in bad water or on food, and cannot be transferred
via the air.
