A kindergarten teacher in China has been sentenced to death for poisoning dozens of children in an act of revenge against a colleague that left one toddler dead.

A court in the central Chinese province of Henan said on Monday [28 Sep 2020] that [WY] put sodium nitrite into porridge being prepared for her colleague's pupils, causing 25 of them to fall sick. The attack, which took place in March last year [2019], left one boy severely ill for months before he died in January this year [2020], according to news reports.

The Jiaozuo City Intermediate People's Court said [WY] knew sodium nitrite was harmful but went ahead "with no regard for the consequences," leaving many innocent children in hospital. News reports last year [2019] said the children began vomiting and fainting after eating their breakfast.

Kindergarten pupils in China are aged between 3 and 6 years. Sodium nitrite is used for curing meats but can be toxic when ingested in high amounts.

The death sentence was handed to [WY] this week for the offence of using dangerous substances. [WY] concealed her reasons for the poisoning after carrying out the crime and her "motives were despicable," the court said.

Her "criminal methods and circumstances were exceedingly bad, with especially severe circumstances, and she should be severely punished in accordance with the law," the sentencing statement from the court said. The court added [WY] and the manager of the kindergarten must compensate the children's families.

It was not the 1st time [WY] had used sodium nitrite to poison someone, according to the authorities. In 2017, she put the substance in her husband's mug, causing him minor injuries.

[Sodium nitrate has on a number of occasions been mistaken for table salt. Clinical signs of ingestion may include gastroenteritis, abdominal pains, dizziness, bloody diarrhea, convulsions, and collapse. Purging and diuresis are expected. If the victim receives small, repeated doses there may be headache and mental impairment. Generally, in the case of mistaking sodium nitrate for sodium chloride, the dose may be larger for large meals typical of celebrations. Rare cases of nitrates being converted to the more toxic nitrites have been reported.

Sodium nitrate has been used in curing meat for centuries. Bacterial action converts the nitrate to nitrite, which kills the organism responsible for botulism poisoning. Generally, sodium nitrite has replaced sodium nitrate, except in slow-cured hams.

Nitrite is added to certain foods to prevent the growth of the spore-forming bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_, whose toxin causes botulism, leading to paralysis and, potentially, death. The word botulinum comes from the Latin word botulus, meaning sausage, which was responsible for many deaths centuries ago before curing with nitrite was used. In addition to serving as an antimicrobial, nitrite is used to produce the characteristic flavor, texture, and pink color of cured meats.

At significant blood levels, the nitrite's oxidation of the iron in hemoglobin from the ferrous to the ferric state yields methemoglobin, which does not carry oxygen and imparts a brown hue to the blood. Symptoms of methemoglobinemia include headaches, fatigue, tachycardia (fast heart rate), weakness, and dizziness. As oxygenation of tissues decreases to the point of becoming truly inadequate, dyspnea (shortness of breath), acidosis, arrhythmias (irregular heart rhythms), coma, convulsions, and even death may occur.

If the children in this article were 3 to 6 years of age, they were not likely to be adult size; consequently, an adult dose administered to a small child could be fatal or certainly result in more profound clinical signs.

The following 2 paragraphs were extracted from https://www.hindawi.com/journals/criem/2016/9013816/:

"The estimated lethal dose of sodium nitrite in adults is approximately 2.6  g [...]; however, a case of a patient surviving after ingesting 6  g of sodium nitrite has been reported [...]. Severe methemoglobinemia with fatal outcomes following ingestion of sodium nitrite and intentional self-poisoning has been reported [...].

"The initial sign of methemoglobinemia is cyanosis [...], and the diagnosis should be considered in all patients who present with cyanosis, particularly if it does not improve with supplemental oxygen. As the levels reach 30%-40%, symptoms such as headache, fatigue, tachycardia, weakness, and dizziness are experienced. Methemoglobin levels of 60% produce lethargy, convulsions, and coma. Methemoglobin levels of greater than 70% are generally lethal, although survival has been reported with a level of 94% [...]. Nitrite is also a potent vasodilator and can cause coronary ischemia and stroke as a result of hypotension, tachycardia, and hypoxia.

"Methylene blue [...] is indicated as the first-line antidote therapy for patients with severe methemoglobinemia." - Mod.TG
