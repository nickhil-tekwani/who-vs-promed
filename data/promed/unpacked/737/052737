The outbreak of blue ear disease [porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome] that occurred 2 weeks ago in 2 farms in the
Central Highlands province of Dac Lac have not been contained. The
disease has infected 200 of 260 pigs in the farms located in Buon Ho
Town's Cu Bao Commune, the provincial Department of Agriculture and
Rural Development said on Thursday [23 Jul 2009].

[PRRS (Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, also named blue
ear disease) is caused by a virus, which is currently classified as a
member of the newly established order of _Nidovirales_, family
_Arteriviridae_, genus _Arterivirus_. It is now ubiquitous throughout
most of the pig-rearing areas of the world and is believed to exist
in 2 main forms -- the type 1 genotype, which predominates in Europe
and the type 2, which predominates in the USA. A complicating factor
in PRRS epidemiology has been the use of live vaccines, some of which
have caused clinical disease and become established in the local pig
population. Such vaccines have allegedly been applied throughout the
world, including Asia.

Increasing data indicate that PRRSV is antigenically, genetically,
and pathologically very heterogenic.

PRRS was initially reported from Viet Nam in April 2007, allegedly
introduced from neighboring China where it had started its massive
epizootic in 2006, initially known there as "Swine High Fever
Disease." The disease, declared enzootic in Viet Nam since 23 Feb
2008, has spread throughout the country. OIE's summary, including a
map, is available at
