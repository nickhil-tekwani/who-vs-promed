Hong Kong's health authority said on Sunday [3 Jun 2012] that the 2-year-old boy confirmed with influenza A (H5N1) on Saturday [2 Jun 2012] is currently receiving isolated treatment at Princess Margaret Hospital and his condition remained serious.

According to the health department's investigation, the boy had been to Anhui province with his parents from 20-22 May [2012], when he had no direct poultry contact. He had visited a wet market with live poultry near his residence in Guangzhou in mid-May [2012].

The department said it is continuing the contact tracing work. Apart from the boy's parents, it had traced contacts with the patients in the private medical clinic in Mong Kok, ambulance, and Caritas Medical Center (CMC), totaling around 80 people.

Among them, 2 healthcare workers from CMC developed some respiratory symptoms and nasopharyngeal aspirates taken from them were tested negative for influenza A (H5).

Earlier, laboratory tests of the boy's parents, 2 health care workers of the private clinic, and another patient who attended the same clinic were all tested negative for influenza A (H5).

The boy developed fever and runny nose on 23 May [2012] in Guangdong. He came to Hong Kong on 26 May 2012 and sought medical attention from a private medical clinic in Mong Kok. Subsequently, he developed febrile convulsions and was taken to the Accident and Emergency Department of Caritas Medical Center on 28 May 2012.

[This report provides new information about the human case of A H1N1 influenza virus infection in China.

Concerning the time and place of the boy's infection, the WHO fact sheet states that, "The incubation period for H5N1 avian influenza may be longer than that for normal seasonal influenza, which is around 2-3 days. Current data for H5N1 infection indicate an incubation period ranging from 2-8 days and possibly as long as 17 days. WHO currently recommends that an incubation period of 7 days be used for field investigations and the monitoring of patient contacts." Thus, the boy's possible exposure to poultry in the wet market may be where his infection was acquired.
