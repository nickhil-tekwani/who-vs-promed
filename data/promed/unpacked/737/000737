Health officials are warning of a potential measles epidemic in South
Warwickshire. The Health Protection Agency has been notified of 27
suspected cases, most of them in children under the age of 10; 12
cases had been reported by 10 Nov 2008. Last year [2007], there were
only 7 cases for the whole of November.

The agency is urging parents whose children have not had the MMR
(measles, mumps, and rubella) [vaccine] to contact their GPs and
arrange to have them. Agency spokeswoman Dr Huda Mohamed: "We are on
the cusp of a measles epidemic and we must do all we can to head it
off by encouraging parents to immunise their children."

[South Warwickshire General Hospitals NHS Trust incorporates Warwick
and Stratford-upon-Avon Hospitals. The Trust serves a community of
approximately 270 000 in South Warwickshire and the surrounding
areas. The largest population centres are the towns of Kenilworth,
Royal Leamington Spa, Southam, Stratford-upon-Avon, and Warwick.

This outbreak of measles has escalated from 3 cases on 4 Nov 2008 to
12 cases on 10 Nov 2008, and now to 27 cases. It demonstrates the
vulnerability of (presumably) unvaccinated children even in a
community without large population centres. In South Warwickshire 84
per cent of children under 5 have had 2 MMR vaccinations.

[It would be instructive to know the percentage of unvaccinated
children under 10 as well as under 5, and the percentage of cases that
had been vaccinated. - Mod.JW]
