The quarantine system designed to stem the spread of highly
pathogenic avian influenza is anything but watertight, authorities
have found. Gyeonggi Province [also called Kyonggi; see map at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Gyeonggi_map.png>] reported
Monday [25 Dec 2006] that 5600 chickens transported from a farm in
Chonan, South Chungcheong Province [map at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Korea_chungcheong.png>] to a
Hwaseong slaughterhouse 2 days earlier were culled since they were
found to have come from a bird-flu infected area.
The Chonan chicken farm lies within the quarantine radius of an Asan
duck farm infected with a highly pathogenic bird flu strain. The farm
was within 10 km of the infected area, the radius within which all
transport and release of poultry are restricted. The chickens were
transported without the required release documents. Worse, they were
infected with Newcastle disease [NCD], a class 1 animal communicable disease.
Byung-gyu Lim, a quarantine official with the Gyeonggi provincial
government, said the chickens were transferred while awaiting
inspection results from the National Veterinary Research and
Quarantine Service after around 10 000 chickens died of respiratory
and central nervous system problems since 21 Dec 2006, 2 days before
the transport of the chickens from Chonan. He said South Chungcheong
Povince and the Chonan city governments are investigating how 5000
chickens were permitted outside the area under such conditions.
Unlike bird flu, Newcastle disease is not communicated to human
beings, yet infected birds are under transport ban and must be culled
immediately.
