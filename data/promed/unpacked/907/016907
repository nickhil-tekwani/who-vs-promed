The public health protection authorities in the Czech Republic report
a rise in cases of viral hepatitis A (HAV) since the end of May 2008.
In total, as many as 602 HAV cases have been reported in 2008 until
the end of calendar week 39 [28 Sep 2008].

In the Czech Republic, hepatitis A is a mandatory reportable disease,
and its prevention is specified in the guidelines of the Ministry of
Health [1]. When suspecting or diagnosing HAV, the attending
physician (usually a general practitioner) refers the patient to the
hospital, where the patient is isolated in an infectious diseases
ward. The physician reports the case to the public health protection
authority without delay. All patients with suspected hepatitis A or
quarantined persons are screened for diagnostic markers of HAV. The
confirmed case of HAV is a case that meets the clinical case
definition and is laboratory-confirmed in accordance with the
European Union (EU) case definition [2].

The current situation of viral hepatitis A in the Czech Republic
----------------------------------------------------------------
Since the end of May 2008, a rise in HAV cases has been observed in
the Czech Republic (illustrated by a histogram in the original text).
As many as 602 HAV cases were reported between calendar weeks 1 and
39 of 2008, 8 times more than in the same period of 2007 (when 75 HAV
cases were reported until week 39). It is about a 6-fold rise in
comparison with the average number of cases reported in the same
period in 2003-2007 (mean 96, range 75-198 cases reported).

The highest numbers of cases have been reported from 2 of the 14
administrative regions: Prague region with 346 HAV cases (57.5
percent of the reported total number of cases) and the neighbouring
Central Bohemian region with 83 cases (13.8 percent). In the other
regions, only sporadic HAV cases and small outbreaks (mainly in
household clusters) have been reported, similar to previous years.

Age and sex distribution
------------------------
Of the total of 602 HAV cases, 364 (60.5 percent) have been reported
in males and 238 (39.5 percent) in females. As to age distribution,
most (78.5 percent) cases have been diagnosed in patients aged from
15 to 64 years. The peak number of cases (166 cases) has been
recorded in the age group 25-34 years. The most affected age group
with the highest incidence rate of cases is that of 20-24-year-olds.
Both the absolute and relative morbidity figures are illustrated
diagrammatically in the original text. No death was reported.

46 (7.6 percent) HAV cases were reported in the age group 0-14 years.
An increase in HAV cases in this age group has been observed since
July 2008 and is becoming more pronounced with children coming back
to school in September. This is consistent with the known seasonal
phenomenon of increase in HAV clusters in schools after the summer
vacation. Nevertheless, this year [2008] the upward trend is expected
to continue.

Risk groups
-----------
A rise in HAV cases has been observed especially since calendar week
26 (starting 22 June 2008), when injecting drug users (IDUs) were the
most affected group. Substantial increase in HAV cases among IDUs was
recorded in the age group 25-34 years, in particular in the Prague
and Central Bohemian regions with HAV epidemic outbreaks. Until week
39 of 2008, as many as 128 HAV cases, i.e. 21.3 percent of the
reported total, were diagnosed in IDUs, and the current situation of
HAV occurrence in this group could be considered as an ongoing
outbreak. The lack of hygiene is the most probable reason for
person-to-person transmission in this group.

The remaining majority of 474 HAV cases occurred in the general
population, in clusters (such as in prisons) and in risk groups (e.g.
homeless people, alcoholics). Some of those individuals could be
unidentified IDUs.

Imported cases
--------------
Investigations revealed 35 HAV cases to have been imported to the
Czech Republic from other countries. Ten cases were imported from
Egypt, 4 cases from Slovakia, 3 each from Croatia and Greece, 2 cases
each from Spain, Tunisia and Turkey, and single cases from 9 other
countries. No case appeared to be linked to the Latvian outbreak
[3,4].

Conclusions
-----------
In the current situation characterised by a rise in HAV cases, the
standard anti-epidemic measures are taken, coordinated by the
Ministry of Health. They include patient isolation and quarantine,
surveillance of contacts, disinfection and targeted vaccination in
the outbreak areas. Post-exposure prophylaxis by vaccine was provided
to HAV contacts in foci, and preventive vaccination was offered to
IDUs and homeless people in Prague.

HAV patients' contacts that perform activities at risk of spreading
the infection (e.g. food industry) are instructed not to continue
such activities and to remain under enhanced surveillance for 50 days
after the last contact with the patient. The public health protection
authorities issued HAV response information for school facilities and
general practitioners (GPs). Information for the general public is
available primarily at the websites of the National Institute of
Public Health, Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic and Regional
Public Health Authorities and in the mass media. Active surveillance
including detailed epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

[This report brings some clarity and precision to the confused press
reports from the Czech Republic previously posted on ProMED-mail. It
is clear from the data contained in this report that the epidemic has
yet to peak, and further information is awaited to judge the success
of the current containment measures.
