A total of 2 emus have tested positive for the mosquito-borne equine encephalitis virus, which can be transmitted to humans, the Oneida County Health Department said Tue [20 Sep 2016].

Mosquitoes acquire the virus by feeding on infected birds. [And mosquitoes may transmit it to uninfected birds, too. - Mod.TG]

The presence of an EEE (Eastern Equine Encephalitis) positive animal confirms there are mosquitoes infected with the virus that can transmit it to people and other animals, and people should be vigilant in taking measures to prevent mosquito bites, health officials said.

No cases of the virus in humans have been reported this year [2016] in Wisconsin, they said. The most recent case was in 2011, the 2nd known case in the state since 1984.

Signs of the infection in animals, such as horses, include depression, loss of appetite, drooping eyelids and lower lip, blindness, paralysis and death. Horse owners can vaccinate their horses against EEE virus to protect them from becoming ill.

Most people infected with EEE virus do not have symptoms. However, some infected people develop inflammation of the brain that typically begins with sudden onset of fever, headache, chills and vomiting. The illness may become severe resulting in disorientation, seizures, coma or death. There is no treatment.

[We do not often hear of emus (_Dromaius novaehollandiae_) being infected with EEE. However, they are quite sensitive and should be vaccinated yearly, just as our equine friends should be vaccinated yearly. The antigenic response to EEE wanes quickly and requires revaccination in horses about every 4 months. Sadly, many horses are euthanized from this disease. The same is true with emus and in fact many unvaccinated emus may die before they are euthanized. Horses, emus and pheasants are all quite sensitive to this disease. Fortunately the equine vaccine works well in the birds as well.

Vaccinating emus for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE)
------------------------------------------------------
Mosquito season always brings with it the threat of mosquito-borne disease. For the emu farmer, this includes the danger of their flock picking up Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE). EEE is known to occur in many species of birds, horses and even man. Signs of EEE in emu include sudden onset of weakness, staggering, bloody diarrhea and rapid death, usually within 24 hours of first onset of symptoms. The virus can be "shed" in feces, blood or vomit. Humans can pick up this disease through contact with the virus through mucous membranes and/or open wounds, so caution should be used when handling the carcasses.

Fortunately, there is a vaccine available to prevent EEE in emu, the same one that is used for horses. "The farmer should know that giving an equine product is off label and there is always a possibility of a vaccine reaction," says Thomas N. Tully, Jr., DVM, MS. Dr. Tully reports that such reactions are rare, but that the farmer should be aware that it could happen. "A complete equine dose should be injected in the leg muscle using appropriate restraint and aseptic technique," said Dr. Tully. According to Dr. Tully, the equine vaccine may safely contain equine tetanus, but should NOT be manufactured from cell culture or contain equine influenza vaccine (this could cause a false positive reading for avian influenza). The vaccine can be multivalent EEE, WEE, and VEE.

The known benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks when considering the possibility of an EEE outbreak. In addition to the possible danger to you and your family, you can lose an entire emu population on one farm within days. Your local vet clinic will know if EEE is a local concern or if there is an EEE outbreak in your area since this is important information for horse owners.

Dr. Tully recommends vaccinating emu chicks starting at 6-8 weeks then again at 10-12 weeks, with a final injection at 16-18 weeks, then every 6 months thereafter. "In the face of an outbreak the farmers can booster their birds at that time," says Dr. Tully. "For adults that have not been vaccinated they should be vaccinated once with a booster 3 weeks later, then every 6 months thereafter." Additional information is available in the book Ratite Management, Medicine and Surgery edited by Thomas N., Jr. Tully and Simon M. Shane. The book is a guide to the diagnosis and prevention of infectious diseases and metabolic conditions in commercial ratites. There are contributions by more than 15 experts in specific fields.
