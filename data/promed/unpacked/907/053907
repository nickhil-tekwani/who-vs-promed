Cassava phytoplasma disease (CPD) is a current serious threat to the country's cassava industry. Becoming prevalent and continuing to spread in several parts of the country, it threatens cassava supply for food, feeds and industrial uses. It is also feared to decrease export volume to as much as 30 per cent.

Addressing this concern, a group of researchers initiated a program to combat the disease.

Surveys illustrated that all regions showed high CPD susceptibility for 3 cassava varieties. All planting materials from Bukidnon [Region X] showed heavy CPD infection, which spread to areas where these are planted. [The] Department of Agriculture imposed a quarantine order in Bukidnon in 2015. Of the 29 samples collected from Visayas and Mindanao, 16 were found positive to the infection.

An improved protocol for phytoplasma DNA extraction and PCR analyses [was developed] towards an effective diagnosis and characterization of the disease.

Treatment of cassava cuttings in streptomycin solution before planting was the most effective method in lowering mortality and increasing germination rate. The treatment increased root yield (77-187 per cent), dry matter (8-29 per cent), and starch content (12-21 per cent) compared with controls.

[In the Philippines (and other areas in SE Asia), "cassava phytoplasma disease" refers to witches' broom, which has been reported to be present in more than half of cassava plantings in the region (see link below).

In South East Asia, cassava witches' broom disease (CWBD; synonym cassava phyllody) is caused by a phytoplasma of the _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma asteris group (16SrI). In Brazil, a phytoplasma of the 16SrIII (X-disease) group (which also contains the cassava frogskin pathogen from southern America; ProMED-mail post 20071130.3864), has been reported as the cause of similar symptoms.

Symptoms may include excessive proliferation of branches ("witches' brooms"), small leaves, shortened internodes, purple discolouration of "brooms," stunting, and loss of plant vigour. Characteristically, shoot distortion or leaf chlorosis are not normally observed. Tubers are reduced in size with rough textured skin and brown streaks in the flesh. The disease can seriously affect starch content of tubers. Total crop losses have been reported as well as up to 30 per cent reduction in starch content of harvestable roots. CWBD also leads to loss of planting material. Disease development is favoured by moderate temperatures; symptoms become less obvious or even disappear at higher temperatures.

CWBD is mainly spread by vegetative propagation of the crop; mechanical transmission (for example with agricultural tools) has also been reported. No insect vectors have been identified so far, but research on CWBD epidemiology is continuing. Disease management relies on the use of certified clean planting material. Thermotherapy followed by meristem tip culture may be used to obtain phytoplasma-free tissue culture lines for propagation.

While the streptomycin treatments mentioned above are obviously improving crop yield, they will only suppress, but not eliminate phytoplasmas in host tissues and are no substitute for certification of planting material.
