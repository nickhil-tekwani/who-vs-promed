Avian Influenza - Current Situation
---------------------------------------
At this moment there are 18 poultry farms where symptoms of Avian
Influenza (AI) have been recorded. During the last 24 hours, one farm
has been added to the list; the "10 km infected zone" in the
Barneveld area has been applicably extended.
Samples are taken from all farms involved; the AI virus has been
already definitely identified, by a validated test method, in 2 of
them. The results of the official EU-prescribed tests are not yet
available. The initial results of samples from a suspected farm in
Laren are negative; consequently, I have cancelled the destruction of
poultry within a 1-km zone around the said farm. The birds on the
suspected farm itself have been destroyed.
During the first 72 hours following the notification of the disease
to the Services under my political responsibility, central as well as
regional crisis-management activities have been put into action. It
has been confirmed that the national mass-destruction capacity is
limited. I have therefore requested assistance abroad. This has
enabled increasing the number of destroyed animals from several tens
of thousands to 150 000 per day as of 5 Mar 2003. From 6 Mar 2003,
the capacity will be more than 250 000 animals/day. The applied
methods are required to minimize the risk of spread, and to comply
with bio-security, effectiveness and speed of the killing,
environmental, and labor considerations.
As of this morning, the entire stock in 7 affected plants has been stamped
out; it is expected that during the day, the number will reach 14.
This activity
is carried out 24 hours a day. Subsequent to the destruction of the poultry
in affected plants, all animals within a 1-km radius around them will
be destroyed as well, excluding -- as mentioned earlier -- in the
farms around
the plant in Laren.
Based upon the Italian experience and advice from prominent
veterinarians, I have decided that destruction of all animals within
a 3-km zone is out of order. This is based upon the concentration of
potential spread of infection within a radius of 1 km around the
plants.
Vaccination as an alternative control method cannot be applied, since
the Italian experience has demonstrated that vaccination might be
beneficial only if there is an absolute certainty of the absence of
the virus. In addition, the Netherlands still has no test for the
detection of the virus. On top of that, vaccination of poultry is
exceptionally laborious and time-consuming, therefore logistically
not simple to apply.
Regarding public-health considerations: as said in my letter of 3 Mar
2003, the risks for public health are negligible, based upon
information from the Food and Non-Food Authority (VWA) and from the
Coordinating Board for Infectious Disease (BAO) in the Ministry of
Public Health, Sport and Welfare (VWS). BAO's determination, in turn,
is based upon the opinion of the Outbreak Management Team Influenza
(OMT) chaired by the Director Public Health in the National Institute
for Public Health and Environment (RIVM). The Secretary of State of
the VWS has adopted, on 5 Mar 2003, BAO's statement dated 4 Mar 2003.
However, scientists represented in the OMT have remarked that the
possibility of the current virus mutating when in contact with human
influenza virus cannot be completely excluded. In such a case, the
avian virus might change into a variant which might endanger humans.
In view of the available data of the current avian virus in the
poultry farms, they consider the possibility of such a development
very remote.
The opinions of VWA and OMT/BAO have taken these exceptional
possibilities into account. Therefore, the OMT includes in its
opinion a recommendation to take protective measures for people who
come in extended and close contact with infected poultry. This
relates mainly to the personnel engaged with the destruction
activities; such measures have already been applied.
Within the limits of my legal capacity and as far as control measures
are not affected, I shall exclude avians of rare breeds from
destruction.
