Import of Meat Restricted in Stavropol Territory.
Import of meat and meat products from Russia's regions into Stavropol
Territory during summer heat has been restricted by an executive order "On
Measures to Safeguard the Stavropol Territory Against Bringing in and for
the Prevention of the Most Dangerous Infections" taken by the office of
Stavropol Territory governor Alexander Chernogorov. In the North Caucasus,
in particular, cases of malignant anthrax were reported. Nine people died
of this disease in Kabardino-Balkaria, five in Kalmykia and three in the
Krasnodar Territory in the current year.
According to experts, a threat of anthrax epidemics has already arisen this
summer in the Stavropol Territory. Not long ago the Stavropol Sanitary
Epidemiological Inspectorate withdrew Krasnodar-made sausage from the
trading network in which agents of this dangerous illness had been
found.[This statement indicates that _B. anthracis_ was cultured from the
sausages. MHJ Infectious pedigree pigs were brought from Kalmykia for the
purposes of breeding [... sic. Now all the motor transport entering
Stavropol Territory is subject to examination at roadside check-points, in
keeping with the executive order.
