[According to] the Health Minister, 173 people have died of
chikungunya [virus infection] in the state [of Kerala] this year
[2007]. However, a team of health experts from New Delhi, who
surveyed the affected districts of Kerala, has confirmed that
chikungunya [cases are] on the decline. It also ruled out the
prevalence of a 'tomato fever' [local term for a red skin rash. -
Mod.TY] as was reported by a section of the media.
The "chikungunya virus has not mutated and the disease is showing a
declining trend. In 18 months, this virus can be fully eradicated
through vector control measures," said Nirmal Kumar Ganguly, the
director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research.
Opposition [political] leader Oomen Chandy has, meanwhile, [said,]
"Though the minister claims 173 people have died, the truth is that
562 people have died on account of fever.

[This has been a confusing febrile outbreak, with cases estimated to
exceed 5000 and several etiological agents implicated (see ProMED-mail
20070712.2235).
The Director General's assertion that the chikungunya virus can be
eradicated in 18 months through vector control will be a challenge,
as it would require a commitment by the public, over a large area, to
collaborate with the control effort and eliminate _Aedes_ mosquito
breeding sites in and around their houses and buildings -- something
that has been successful in halting dengue epidemics in only 2
countries (Singapore and Cuba).
It is more likely that the epidemic will stop when an inadequate
number of susceptible individuals remain to permit transmission.
Vector control can speed the decline in transmission that appears to
be underway. ProMED-mail will be interested in the results of efforts
to control vectors, and wishes them success with this program.
