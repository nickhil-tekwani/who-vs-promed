New York City is investigating a possible deadly dog disease, leptospirosis, linked to rats which could be spreading in Brooklyn.

New York City Department of Health is investigating multiple dog deaths possibly linked to a rat-transmitted illness, and a popular Brooklyn park has been closed as officials investigate.

At least 4 pets have experienced signs close to leptospirosis, a bacterial disease spread through urine, especially from rodents and farm animals.

Leptospirosis can be a life-threatening disease in canines. For humans, it is mostly similar to a case of the flu. Transmission from dog to human is considered rare.

Councilmember Lincoln Restler serves Williamsburg where McCarren Park is nestled. Restler announced on social media receiving reports of fatalities linked to the dog-run last week [week of 17 Jan 2022].

McCarren Park is closed Monday [24 Jan 2022] and throughout the week for emergency repairs. NYC Parks is working on interim improvements, including updating the dog-run drainage, installing rodent-resistant garbage cans, and adding mulch.

"We like our 4-legged friends happy and healthy and are sad to learn some pups may have recently been impacted by leptospirosis. We are actively engaged with the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, and exploring options to mitigate any related risks," said NYC Parks in a statement.

According to the department, characterizing the reported cases as an outbreak is inaccurate as the link has yet to be confirmed.

The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene is conducting safe pest extermination and notes an exterminator last checked the area 3 weeks ago.

Associate Regional Medical Director, Dr Jeremy Kimmelstiel, of Bond Vet clinic, states signs of leptospirosis can be variable from mild, moderate, to severe.

"In the mild senses, it may just be a 1-off day. More moderate clinical signs are vomiting, diarrhea, and lethargy. In the severe forms, it is significant kidney or liver failure," Dr Kimmelstiel told NBC New York.

Signs in severe cases coincide with the loss of appetite, increased thirst or urination, and yellowing of the skin or white around the eyes.

In order to prevent spread, Dr Kimmelstiel noted to not bring a dog to the park if not feeling well, avoid highly populated areas, and check the conditions of the park.

If much excrement is around, choose another location to socialize the pet. Also, stop a dog from drinking possibly contaminated standing water.

"Our dogs can definitely be affected by the animals living here and have a right to live here. Certainly, we know there are problems with the rat population, but it is not something we are going to be able to make a massive difference on," said Dr Kimmelstiel.

If caught early on, leptospirosis can be treated with antibiotics. More severe cases may need dialysis.

This veterinarian suggests testing as soon as possible if the pet is experiencing signs, as well as getting vaccinated to prevent infection.

"We're calling it a single bacterium, but there are actually around 400 or 500 variants of leptospirosis existing in the world. We're vaccinating for 4 of the most common serovars (types), but there's always a chance a different variant of leptospirosis could become infectious even in a previously infected or vaccinated dog," shared Dr Kimmelstiel. [It should be noted there are multiple serovars in one vaccine, so the preventative vaccine is a single injection, yearly. - Mod.TG]

[The following is from the Schwarzman Animal Medical Center website (https://www.amcny.org/pet_health_library/leptospirosis-in-dogs-causes-and-treatment/):

Background
----------
"Leptospirosis, commonly known as 'lepto,' is a contagious, bacterial disease, causing serious damage to the kidney and/or liver. The bacteria causing leptospirosis are spread through the urine of infected animals, which can get into water or soil and survive there for weeks or months.

"Dogs contract leptospirosis when the bacteria enter the body through the skin or mucous membranes (eyes, nose, or mouth), especially if the skin is broken from a cut or scratch. Drinking contaminated water can also cause infection, and the disease can be passed from a mother dog to her puppies through the placenta.

"Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease, meaning it can be transmitted from animals to humans. In humans, leptospirosis can cause flu-like symptoms and may lead to liver or kidney disease.

Risk factors
------------
"Risk factors include swimming in or drinking from contaminated streams, lakes, and puddles, exposure to wildlife or farm animals, and contact with infected animals or their urine.

"While it was once seen mostly in rural areas, leptospirosis is becoming increasingly common in urban and suburban areas as well. Dogs who play in or near mud or puddles are at especially high risk for leptospirosis.

Signs
-----
"The following are common in dogs with clinical signs, although many dogs show no signs at all:
- Lethargy
- Increased thirst
- Vomiting
- Loss of appetite
- Fever
- Jaundice (yellow discoloration of the skin)
- Discolored urine (dark yellow to orange)
- Joint or muscle pain

"If your dog is showing any of these signs, see your veterinarian immediately because leptospirosis is one of several serious diseases causing these clinical signs. Delaying treatment can lead to severe kidney or liver damage -- and may be fatal.

Diagnosis
---------
"Leptospirosis is diagnosed based on exposure history, clinical examination, and diagnostic testing. The microscopic agglutination test (MAT), a cage side test, and the PCR test are commonly used to diagnose the disease. The MAT is performed in a specialized laboratory and looks for antibodies in the blood. Since antibodies may not show up early in the illness, the MAT test may need to be repeated to confirm a diagnosis. The cage side test is performed in the clinic using a drop of blood. Because the results are available in minutes, a positive test result helps direct treatment. The PCR test is also performed in a specialized laboratory and looks for the DNA of _Leptospira_ bacteria in the blood and urine. In some situations, all 3 tests will be performed to confirm a diagnosis.

Treatment
---------
"If it's caught early, antibiotics are very effective for treating leptospirosis. However, if there is already severe damage to the dog's liver or kidneys, the dog may need to be hospitalized for supportive care with intravenous fluids. Hemodialysis may be required to replace the normal function of the kidneys while antibiotics clear up the infection. Long-term liver or kidney disease may persist, even with appropriate treatment.

Prevention
----------
"Getting your dog vaccinated against leptospirosis and keeping them up to date on vaccine boosters can help protect your dog. However, the vaccine is only effective against certain strains, so it's also important to keep your dog away from wild animals and to discourage drinking from or playing in streams, lakes, ponds, and puddles. When taking long walks, be sure to bring along fresh water for your dog, so they are not tempted to drink from potentially contaminated water sources. If your dog is sick and showing clinical signs consistent with leptospirosis, be sure to inform your veterinarian if your dog has been near wildlife or standing water.

"If you are caring for a dog with leptospirosis, it's important to wear gloves to avoid infection."

Dog parks and other areas where dogs often lick and sniff an area before urinating on it can be high-risk areas. The act of licking, which is normal dog behavior, can be how your canine pet picks up the bacteria. Rodents are known carriers of this bacteria and increasing populations of rodents increase your pet's risk. Rodents can be found in alleys, yards, and many places, unobserved by humans, but leaving an intriguing odor for your pet.

Please take care of your pets by having them vaccinated. This also helps protect you. Cleaning up after a dog accident can put you at risk of the disease. You may not know your pet is carrying the disease until late in the disease stage. So please vaccinate your pet and protect yourself.
