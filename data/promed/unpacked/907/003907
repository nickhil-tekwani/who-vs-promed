Seals in New Jersey have been dying in unusually high numbers from a
mysterious disease that starts with a cough and a runny nose, a leading
animal treatment facility say. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center says
one-third of the 31 seals brought to its facility this year have died so
far. That is more than double the usual mortality rate of 14 percent. The
disease has been found among all four local seal species -- gray, harbor,
harp and hooded. But hooded seals, an Arctic species that winters along the
U.S. mid-Atlantic Coast, have had the worst of it. Only two of six hooded
seals treated at the stranding center have survived.
