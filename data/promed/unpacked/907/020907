A forest watcher of neighboring Wayanad District has died due to suspected Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), also known as monkey fever, which has already claimed 5 lives in the past one month, officials said today [11 Mar 2015].

A 48-year-old [man], a temporary staffer in the forest department, was admitted to taluk hospital at Sultan Bathery on Saturday [7 Mar 2015] with symptoms of monkey fever then shifted to Kozhikode Medical College Hospital where he died yesterday [10 Mar 2015]. However, the district health officials are yet to confirm the reason for his death.

"A blood sample was collected from the person and has been sent to Manipal Centre for Virus Research for further analysis," Deputy Medical Officer, Wayanad, K R Vidhya said today [11 Mar 2015].

Five deaths due to the fever, including 4 tribesmen, have been reported in the district in the last one month.

Having identified 3486 persons as being in the risk group, including those residing in forest hamlets and tribals who depend on forest produce for their livelihoods, health officials will launch a vaccination drive for them from Friday [13 Mar 2015], Vidhya added.

[Kerala state is endemic for KFD virus, which is being actively transmitted this season. An 18 Feb 2015 report indicated that human cases there had reached 40 suspected and 18 confirmed infections in just 3 weeks. After 1-2 weeks of symptoms, some KFD patients recover without complication. However, the illness is biphasic for a subset of patients (10-20 per cent), who experience a 2nd wave of symptoms at the beginning of the 3rd week. These symptoms include fever and signs of neurological manifestations, such as severe headache, mental disturbances, tremors, and vision deficits. The estimated case-fatality rate is from 3 to 5 percent for KFD (http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/symptoms/index.html).

In addition to Kerala state, KFD virus is endemic in several areas in India. Antibody surveys carried out by the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune found antibodies against KFD virus in human blood samples collected from Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, and Andaman and Nicobar Islands (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150107.3077479). There have been previous reports of KFD cases in several areas in Kerala state and adjoining Karnataka state last year (2014). As noted in the ProMED-mail post of 4 Mar 2014 (archive no. 20140304.2313813), the disease was 1st detected in Shimoga district, Karnataka state in 1957 and has since appeared sporadically in the thickly wooded areas of Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, Chikmagalur, Shimoga, and Chamarajanagar (all in Karnataka state), where it is endemic. The disease occurs in humans and monkeys.

Although the virus has been isolated from 16 species of ticks, _Haemaphysalis spinigera_ is the major vector. Most human cases occur during the dry season. KFD virus is a member of the _Flaviviridae_ family.

Additional information is available from the CDC fact sheet (see: http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/Fact_Sheets/KyasanurForestDis.pdf).
