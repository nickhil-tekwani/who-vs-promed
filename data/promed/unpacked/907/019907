A botulism outbreak in Bristol Bay communities is being closely monitored by Alaska state and local health officials. The Department of Epidemiology said on Wed 24 Dec 2014 that at least 25 individuals have so far been linked to a batch of contaminated seal oil produced in the village of Twin Hills. Of the 25, several have been hospitalized; some are being monitored, and health officials are still trying to contact others.

The botulism infections were reported on Fri 19 Dec 2014, after 2 individuals were flown from the village of Quinhagak to Bethel. The 2 were later medevaced to Anchorage, and remain on respiratory support [as of Wed 24 Dec 2014], reportedly unable to breathe on their own. Three others from Quinhagak were treated for symptoms of botulism, and others in Twin Hills and Dillingham have reported symptoms or are being monitored. A child has also shown symptoms of the disease, which can be fatal, according to Dr Michael Cooper, the infectious disease program manager at the State Department of Epidemiology.

"This is a very concerning outbreak," said Dr Cooper. "This is one of the largest clusters of botulism we've ever seen." An investigation linked the illnesses to a batch of seal oil produced in Twin Hills, and Dr Cooper said sampling at a state lab showed the oil was particularly toxic.

"When it was tested, it came back at the highest level the lab instrument can measure for botulinum toxin," he said on Wed 24 Dec 2014. The testing was completed on Tue 23 Dec 2014, and on the next morning the state dispatched a 2nd public health nurse from Anchorage to continue the investigation out of Dillingham. "In an odd twist to this case, after we showed preliminary test results to the family who produced the oil, they sort of refused to stop eating or serving it," said Dr Cooper. On Wed 24 Dec 2014, the state did not have further details about where that batch of seal oil may have been sold or traded in the region.

Botulism is a paralytic illness caused by a toxin produced by the _Clostridium botulinum_ bacterium. In Alaska, botulism occurs almost always in fermented or preserved foods like improperly canned fish and stink heads. According to state data, seal oil appears to be the main culprit behind botulism cases in Alaska, responsible for 54 outbreaks from 1950 to 2010.

"Botulism can be lethal," said Dr Catherine Hyndman, a family physician at the Kanakanak Hospital in Dillingham, where staff were helping track and treat infected individuals. "But one of the big problems, as many know, is that botulism toxin does not necessarily smell or taste out of the ordinary. The food can look and seem to be perfectly normal, but yet be contaminated."

Early symptoms may include nausea and gastrointestinal distress such as vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. According to Dr Hyndman, early signs of muscle paralysis are indicative of botulism. "This is a poison that paralyzes the muscles," she said. "The smallest muscle is the muscle that moves the eye to the sides, to the right or the left, and often times that is the 1st muscle that is paralyzed." Blurred or double vision, unreactive pupils, or drooping eyelids can be a sign of botulism poisoning. Symptoms may appear as early as one day after consuming contaminated food, could also not appear for up to 10 days.

[Seafood is generally associated with type E botulism. The following article is a review of type E: Horowitz BZ. Type E botulism. Clin Toxicol. 2010;48:880-895.

Abstract:
"There are 7 known serotypes of botulism, designated A through G [now 8 - Mod.LL]; almost all human cases of botulism are caused by types A, B, and E. Botulism type E is the predominant serotype causing disease associated with native Arctic foods. In the circumpolar regions of the world, the coastal soils are rich in botulism type E, and consumption of fish and marine animals in these areas are the sources of clusters of botulism. Unlike spores of type A and B, botulism type E can withstand freezing down to 3.5 C [38 F]. Alaskan native fermentation of fish heads, fish eggs, and beaver tail allow proper anaerobic conditions for botulinum toxin to be elaborated from _Clostridium botulinum_. The consumption of whale meat, "muktuk", has also been associated with outbreaks of botulism in Alaska and the Canadian Arctic. Elsewhere in the Arctic regions, type E botulism has been associated with Norwegian "rakfisk" prepared by a process similar to fermented Alaskan foods. Outbreaks in Egypt with the salted gray mullet "faseikh," in Israel and New York linked to salted uneviscerated whitefish "kapchunka", in Iran from eating "ashbal", an uncooked salmon, and in Japan with "izushi", a traditional fermented fish preserved in rice have occurred. Importation of vacuum-packed whitefish from Alaska and Canada has also been associated with sporadic cases of botulism type E in Europe. In March 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the heptavalent antitoxin (H-BAT) for use in the USA under an Investigational New Drug program as the preferred treatment for foodborne botulism, including type E, which had not been covered by the bivalent antitoxin, the prior approved antitoxin product in the USA." - Mod.LL
