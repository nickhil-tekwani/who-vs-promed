Deadly childhood diseases rise in Ethiopia's Tigray as war hampers vaccinations
---------------------------------------
Deadly diseases such as measles, tetanus, and whooping cough are on the rise in Ethiopia's Tigray region after vaccination rates plunged during the civil war that broke out nearly 2 years ago, doctors and regional health officials say.

The percentage of children in Tigray receiving routine vaccines has fallen below 10% this year [2022], data from the Tigray Health Bureau show, undoing years of government efforts to boost immunisation rates.

"The hopes of the children in the region to grow healthier and happier were snatched away in a blink of an eye," the bureau said in a letter this month [September 2022] to the global vaccine alliance Gavi.

A ceasefire between March and late August [2022] between Tigrayan and federal forces allowed in a trickle of medical aid, but humanitarian access has been suspended since fighting resumed, a UN commission of human rights experts said on Monday [19 Sep 2022].

Measles outbreaks
-----------------
Health Minister Lia Tadesse said vaccines had been provided to Tigray this year [2022] and that more were ready to be delivered once conditions allowed.

In its letter, the Tigray Health Bureau said the percentage of children receiving the full 3 doses of the Pentavalent vaccine against diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, hepatitis B, and _Haemophilus influenzae_ type b (Hib) dropped from 99.3% in 2020 to 36% in 2021 and 7% this year [2022].

The rate across Ethiopia was 65% in 2021, according to data from the UN children's agency UNICEF.

The letter said the percentages of children being vaccinated against tuberculosis and measles have also plummeted from over 90% in 2020 to less than 10% this year.

It said there have been measles outbreaks in 10 of the region's 35 districts since the war began and 25 cases of neonatal tetanus this year, compared to just 2 in each of the previous 3 years.

Gavi, which buys and distributes vaccines for developing countries, said it had provided measles and COVID-19 vaccines during the ceasefire, but some activities had been suspended since fighting resumed.

Ethiopia's health minister Lia said 860 000 doses of measles vaccines were delivered to Tigray last December [2021] and additional doses were delivered on 2 Apr 2022.

[There is no confirmation of this report the OCHA situation report, which hasn't focused on the fall in vaccination rates for Ethiopia (https://reports.unocha.org/en/country/ethiopia). ProMED will appreciate further information from knowledgeable sources in the area.

The drop in coverage by the pentavalent vaccine against diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, hepatitis B, and _Haemophilus influenzae_ type b (Hib) from 99.3% in 2020 to 36% in 2021 and 7% this year (2022), will lead to devastating results for the children. Sadly, the civil war is undoing all the progress that had been made in protecting children from these potentially deadly diseases. It is always children who suffer the most during long-running conflicts. - Mod.LK
