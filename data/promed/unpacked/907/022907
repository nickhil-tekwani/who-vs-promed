The Cabanatuan City Provincial Veterinary Office (PVO) culled a total of 207 pigs following reports of hog deaths in Barangay Dalampang, suspected to have been caused by African swine fever (ASF). "Several pigs have died in our place. Blood samples were taken from some of them, while we buried the others," said Amang Soriano, the head of Barangay Dalampang.

Because of the incident, the PVO advised residents, especially hog raisers in the area, to immediately report cases of pig deaths so that prompt measures can be taken. The PVO added that they are being extra cautious because it is the season for increased incidence of vector-borne diseases among livestock.

"It's been warm lately so expect that stress level would be higher, which might result in more deaths," explained Dr. Jun Romero, head of Nueva Ecija Provincial Veterinary Office. "We took samples from several pigs because we suspected it was African swine fever. Laboratory tests turned negative," he added.

The provincial veterinary office is waiting for the result of the laboratory tests conducted on the pig blood samples. If the result turns out positive for ASF, Romero assured they will impose the necessary measures to prevent the spread of the deadly pig virus.

Hog raisers assured, likewise, that they will abide by the protocol should the tests return positive. "We really abide by the government regulations, more so if pig virus is present in our barangay," noted hog raiser Miguel Ramos.

[According to FAO's "ASF situation in Asia" weekly update of 17 Oct 2019 (edited):

"1. Since the Department of Agriculture confirmed the 1st ASF outbreak, which started on [25 Jul 2019], more than 20 outbreaks in 4 provinces/city on Luzon Island have been confirmed; approximately 30 000 pigs have been culled.

2. Since [16 Sep 2019], the Philippines has been implementing its 1-7-10 protocol to manage, contain and control the spread of the disease, i.e., all pigs within 1-km (0.62 mi) radius of infected farms will be culled; animal movement be limited, and swine farms will be under strict surveillance and testing within a 7-km (4.35 mi) radius; swine farms within a 10-km (6.21 mi) radius will be required to submit a mandatory report on the disease.

3. On [13 Oct 2019], the President and the Cabinet approved additional measures to contain and prevent the spread of ASF in Luzon Island, including lock down of 'ASF-infected zones' in Bulacan and Pampanga provinces to ensure movement control of pigs and pork products; from which people sell/buy/transport live pigs, slaughter ASF-infected pigs, and sell ASF-contaminated pork products will be arrested/filed.

4. On [Wed 16 Oct 2019], the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) issued an order to local chief executives to exclude processed meat products from the ban on pork and pork-related products from Luzon."

The immediate notification on the event, which had started on 25 Jul 2019, was submitted by the Philippines to the OIE on 9 Sep 2019. It informed about 7 outbreaks in Luzon and included the following epidemiological comments: "Suspected swill feeding, then spread through illegal movement of already sick pigs that were being sold at a lower price" (see at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=31677).

No follow-up reports have become available since. - Mod.AS
