We have several regions in Germany where the protection of wild geese has led to a massive increase in population and they are destroying pastures like the proverbial locust. Crapping all over livestock feed (grass) certainly poses a risk for cattle as well. The finding of _Clostridium perfringens_ is especially interesting as we have seen a massive surge of _C. perfringens_ associated diseases in cattle this year.

Probably not relevant to the issues discussed in the post, but for what it's worth, The Smithsonian somewhat garbled the history.

What really happened was that after hunting migratory waterfowl with live decoys was federally banned in 1936, the decoy birds, who had been crossed with nonmigratory domestic geese, were impounded, bred, and released by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and state wildlife agencies -- whose personnel apparently never realized that the hybridization that kept the geese in place as decoys also ensured that their offspring would also be nonmigratory.

Instead of joining wild Canada geese in migration, the non-migratory geese demonstrated a distinct preference for remaining all summer in habitats with short-cropped grass, such as parks, yards, airports, and ball fields, where hunting is seldom allowed.

This wasn't a problem for several decades, since foxes, raccoons, and coyotes are all major Canada goose predators and nest-raiders, but then the simultaneous fur trapping boom of 1976-1986 and the mid-Atlantic raccoon rabies pandemic drastically knocked down the goose predator populations for 10 years or so, and that allowed the goose population to very rapidly expand.

Making matters worse, that's when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service declared war on mute swans, which had been major nesting habitat rivals of non-migratory Canada geese. In gist, you can have one pair of mute swans nesting somewhere, or up to 10 non-migratory Canada geese in the same place.

[Not all members' comments have been positive, frankly critical, so we will cut this thread at this point and await the results of any resulting investigations and graduate student field, research upstream and downstream, of Canada geese. With thanks to Sabine and Merritt. - Mod.MHJ]
