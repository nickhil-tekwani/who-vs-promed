CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL TO STUDY MYSTERIOUS BRAZILIAN ILLNESS
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Rio de Janeiro, Nov 09, 2000 (EFE via COMTEX) -- The U.S. laboratories that
initially identified the Ebola virus in Central Africa will investigate the
outbreak of a mysterious disease in suburban Rio de Janeiro that has killed
5 people so far, the daily Extra reported. The Brazilian Ministry of Health
announced it was sending blood samples from each of the victims to the
world-renowned Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta,
Georgia, for analysis.
"It is not normal to send material to the Centers for Disease Control in
the United States for analysis," Hermann Schatzmayr, the head of the
virology department for the state-run Fundacion Oswaldo Cruz, said. "That
only occurs in extremely serious situations. We do not have the maximum
security laboratories that permit the study of unknown viruses and bacteria."
Schatzmayr acknowledged that Brazilian laboratories have been unable to
identify the virus or bacteria that is causing the strange illness in
suburban Rio de Janeiro. The cause of the illness and the way that it is
spread remain unidentified, leading Brazilian health officials to be
increasingly concerned the illness could reach epidemic proportions and
rapidly spread out of control.
