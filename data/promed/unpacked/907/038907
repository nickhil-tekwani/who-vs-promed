The deaths of 2 women on 2 successive days at the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) due to rabies' infection has raised concerns over the increasing menace of stray dogs in the city [Madurai, Tamil Nadu state]. A 55 year old woman was admitted to the GRH on Tuesday [12 Mar 2013] due to rabies infection and died on the same day. Her relatives said that she was bitten by a stray dog 2 weeks ago. They also said that she did not get vaccinated for it. Similarly, a 45 year old woman died in the hospital due to rabies infection. She was hospitalised on Monday [11 Mar 2013] and died the same day. Hospital authorities said that 5 persons died due to rabies infection in the hospital during the last 3 months alone, compared with 12 deaths in the last one year. On average, there have been 10 deaths every year in the last 5 years due to rabies infection.

Following the frequent deaths due to rabies, residents and local representatives have urged the [Madurai] corporation to intensify the vaccination and sterilisation [of dogs]. M Chellam, ward 63 councillor, said that there are several complaints from the residents of her ward about stray dogs. The numbers of stray dogs are increasing in the area and the corporation should intensify efforts to capture them, she said. S Veerakumar, councillor of ward 60, said that the stray dog menace threatens the public in Avaniyapuram [municipality of Madurai district] area. "Corporation authorities take action only when we call them. Despite the dogs being captured they are again found in the same area as they are released in Vellaikal, a nearby place. When the dogs return, they are found more ferocious than earlier and threaten the public," he complained. A resident of Bethaniyapuram said, "The stray dog menace is very high in our area. Our repeated demands to capture the dogs are [not] heeded. We are afraid to cross the streets in the night as dogs seen in the area are ferocious. Last week [week of 11 Mar 2013], a dog bit 4 persons in the area which created panic here," he said. When contacted, Priya Raj, assistant city health officer said that they have been providing vaccination and sterilization of the stray dogs regularly.
