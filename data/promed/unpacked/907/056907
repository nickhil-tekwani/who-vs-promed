The Vermont Department of Health and the Vermont Agency of
Agriculture, Food and Markets announced today [23 Sep 2011] that
eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) was confirmed on 22 Sep 2011 in an
emu from Brandon. This is 1st first time that EEE virus has been
confirmed in a live animal in Vermont. No cases in people have been
reported.

While EEE virus has never caused illness in Vermont, EEE in animals
and people had been reported in Vermont 's bordering states and Quebec
[Canada]. In 2010, testing of deer and moose samples confirmed that
EEE virus was present in Vermont.

EEE is a mosquito-borne virus that is typically spread through the
bite of an infected mosquito. Most mosquitoes do not carry the virus;
however, the Mosquito Control District in Brandon treated the area
around the emu farm to reduce the number of adult mosquitoes.

Erica Berl, DVM, MPH, an infectious disease epidemiologist with the
Health Department, has been carefully tracking mosquito-borne disease
in Vermont all summer. On 14 Sep 2011, she was notified by the
assistant state veterinarian in the Agency of Agriculture Joel Russo
DVM, about a flock of emus with clinical signs suspicious of EEE. The
emus began to get sick last week, but the cause of the illness wasn't
confirmed until yesterday [22 Sep 2011].

"Emus are extremely sensitive to this virus so it is not unexpected
that we found it first in these animals," Dr. Berl said.

In addition to emus, the EEE virus can cause illness in horses,
alpacas, llamas, and people. There is a vaccine for horses, and horse
owners should discuss vaccination with their veterinarians. The
majority of people who might be infected with EEE virus will not
become ill. Those who become ill will have flu-like symptoms such as
fever, chills, fatigue, joint and body aches. These symptoms typically
last 1 or 2 weeks, and recovery is usually complete.

EEE virus has the potential, however to invade the central nervous
system (brain and spinal cord) and cause more serious illness.
Symptoms of severe disease include fever, intense headache, weakness,
poor coordination, irritability, drowsiness, and mental status
changes. About 1/3 of people who develop severe EEE disease die, and
many who recover are left with disabilities. Fortunately, severe EEE
is rare.

"While the risk of illness from this virus is still low in Vermont, it
is not zero, so it is important for people to take precautions to
prevent mosquito bites," Dr Berl said.

Wear long sleeves and pants and avoid outdoor activities at dusk and
dawn when mosquitoes are active.

Reduce mosquito breeding habitats by getting rid of standing water,
and by draining areas where water can pool such as rain gutters,
wading pools, and old tires.

Use insect repellents that are safe and effective against mosquitoes.
Products with a registration number from the Environmental Protection
Agency on the label have been evaluated for safety and effectiveness.
Repellents containing DEET in concentrations up to 30 percent
picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or IR3535 can be used to prevent
mosquito bites.

Install or repair screens on windows and doors to keep mosquitoes
out.

[It should be remembered people cannot acquire EEE from their pets.
The mosquito is the vector that transmits the disease.

Supposedly the equine vaccine works for emus as well, but it is
anecdotal information from some producers. Producers would be wise to
discuss such action with their veterinarian. However, please check
with your veterinarian about vaccinations for your equine friends. -

[Emus infected with EEE carry an extremely high viral burden, and when
sick or dead represent a biohazard. As the American Emu Association
cautions its members: "The virus can be "shed" in feces, blood or
vomit. Humans can pick up this disease through contact with the virus
through mucous membranes and/or open wounds so caution should be used
when handling the carcasses. Contact with bloody feces, blood, or
performing a necropsy procedure after the bird has died is highly
discouraged unless the bird is examined by a well protected,
knowledgeable, trained veterinarian."
