There was an error in the American Phytopathology Society (APS) news release
on aflatoxins which was posted to ProMED-plant on 18 Sep 2000. APS has
corrected the error on the sites where it is posted. In the third paragraph
of the press release, "ppm" should be "ppb." The sentence should read, " In
the U.S., corn, cottonseed, peanuts, and other crops are routinely tested
and those containing more than 20 parts per billion of aflatoxins cannot be
used in human food or fed to dairy cows".
