LEPTOSPIROSIS - GUYANA (COASTAL)(05)

In response to Hans Andresen's posting regarding the lack of any
species/serovar data in postings about leptospirosis, the reason is
that very few labs have the capacity to perform cultures which would
yield the isolates necessary for identification. To be fair, when
outbreaks occur in circumstances such as those currently pertaining
in Guyana, cultures for _Leptospira_ are the last thing on people's
minds, particularly where the lab capacity to do this does not exist
in the 1st place.
The MAT serology performed in reference labs does not identify
species or serovar, but gives an indication of the predominant
serogroups involved. Identification of reservoir animals in the face
of such widespread flooding would not really add focus to
prophylactic efforts, since the flood waters are everywhere and are
presumably widely contaminated with leptospires.
The International Leptospirosis Society
<http://www.med.monash.edu.au/microbiology/staff/adler/ilspage.html>
performed a global survey which was published in 1999 in the WHO
Weekly Epidemiological Record
<http://www.who.int/docstore/wer/pdf/1999/wer7429.pdf>
and has established a surveillance website:
LeptoNet
<http://www.leptonet.net>.
However, such activities depend on the active participation of
workers in the countries affected, and to date the response has been
somewhat disappointing. For this reason, the ILS is currently
repeating the earlier survey. I will be happy to send the
questionnaire to any interested workers.
