After a solid month of cleaning up dead fish, Jim Wilson needed a little
good news. "That's what we are looking for," Wilson said, as he uncovered a
baby loggerhead sea turtle in the sand. "If we weren't here, this little
fellow would have never made it out."
Sea turtle nest 16, one of 2 that the same female loggerhead dug this
summer [2005], had 105 eggs. 3 days earlier, under the light of a nearly
full moon, 67 eggs hatched, and the newborn turtles rushed to the water.
"We call that a jail break," Wilson said. "The whole pack of turtles head
for the water at once."
3 days later, Wilson, the chief ranger at this Pinellas County park,
returned to the nest to see whether any baby turtles were still trapped
inside. "This nest got flooded during the high water of Hurricane Katrina,"
he said. "That is why some of the eggs at the bottom of the nest didn't
make it."
Wilson found 4 live turtles hidden among the broken eggs. He placed them in
a 5-gallon bucket to release that night. But minutes later, he received a
call on the radio that a dead loggerhead had washed up on the beach near a
fishing pier. "I hate to see this," Wilson said. "This animal could be 60
or 70 years old."
Wilson's supervisor, Bob Browning, measured the turtle, one of more than a
hundred that have been found dead on local beaches since a lingering Red
tide flared up in late July [2005]. "This has been a bad year," Browning
said. "One of the worst that that I can remember."
According to Allen Foley, a biologist with the Florida Fish and Wildlife
Conservation Commission's Jacksonville field laboratory, 138 sea turtles
have been stranded on local beaches since 24 Jul 2005. "That is more than
we usually have in a year," Foley said. "It looks like the cause is Red tide."
Foley said 118 of the turtles were found dead. The survivors were
transported to Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota or the Clearwater Marine
Aquarium.
"It could be 50 years before we know what affect this Red tide outbreak
will have on the overall turtle population," said Dr. Charles Manire ,
animal care manager for the dolphin and whale hospital. "We are probably
only seeing 10 to 20 percent of what is actually dying, so the actual
number of dead turtles could be in the thousands. With a population that is
limited, the affect of the Red tide could be catastrophic. Only time will
tell."
Dr. Janine Cianciolo of the Clearwater Marine Aquarium has 5 turtles in her
care. "Some of them have not responded well at all," she said. "Many of the
turtles that come in here are so neurologically damaged that they had no
chance for survival."
Like Mote's Manire, Cianciolo thinks the organism _Karenia brevis_ is to
blame for the rash of turtle deaths. "Every animal that comes in here gets
a blood test. It receives the same quality of medical care you would get if
you went to a hospital," she said. "We have looked at a lot of possible
causes ... but it all points to the Red tide."
A week after her initial interview, Cianciolo was optimistic. The 5 turtles
under her care had improved greatly. "They are all swimming on their own
now," she said. "4 out of the 5 are eating as well. I think the treatment
must be working."
Wilson also was hopeful. "The estimates vary on how many turtles will
return to the beach to nest," he said. "It ranges from one out of a hundred
to one out of a thousand. I'm an optimist, so I like to think it is one out
of a hundred." With that, Wilson released the hatchlings on the beach, and
they scurried toward the surf, 4 more trying to beat the odds.
Red Tide Facts
Red tide is a microscopic algae (plant-like organism) in Florida called
_Karenia brevis_ or _K. brevis._ It produces a toxin that can kill fish and
cause respiratory problems in humans. Red tide can last days, weeks or
months, and can change daily.

Red tide current status report (23 Sep 2005) Present Status: A Florida red
tide caused by the microalga _Karenia brevis_ is still present along
southwest Florida. Concentrations of _K. brevis_ were mostly low to medium
this week along the coast, from northern Pinellas County to Collier County;
high concentrations were found in the Sarasota Bay area (Longboat Pass and
New Pass). The offshore component of the bloom, which has been detected off
the coast of Clearwater since early August 2005, continues and extends to
at least Lee County. Fish kills and some respiratory irritation were
reported from Pinellas, Sarasota, Charlotte, Lee, and Collier counties. Red
tide effects may occur at beach and bay areas as long as the bloom persists
and are most noticeable when winds are from the west.

Red tide is worst since 1971
-------------------------------
Florida's worst red-tide outbreak in 34 years, leaving a swath of dead and
dying fish from Sarasota to Panama City, shows no signs of going away. In
fact, there are fears it may worsen.
"Right now, it stretches from Lee County to the Panhandle, but it's very
patchy, highly concentrated in one place and low concentrations in
another," said Cynthia Heil, Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute
red-tide group leader. She credited Hurricane Katrina with breaking up the
algal bloom.
But Heil said the current bloom, which began in January 2005 and was
magnified by August's heat, may not be over. "Generally, blooms last only 2
to 6 months, and this one has gone on for 9 months. Normally, red tides
start in September, so we're actually just going into the red-tide season,"
she said.
The algae, which contain a neurotoxin that kills fish and other forms of
marine life, has devastated parts of Florida's west coast. It has created a
2000-square-mile area of sea bottom off northern Pinellas and Pasco
counties devoid of anything living, a dead zone. And it caused a fish kill
in Tampa Bay, where parts of the bay were so covered with dead fish
floating belly-up that they looked like snow.
Yet somehow, southwest Florida's fragile snook populations took only a
minor hit. Ron Taylor, the marine biologist tracking snook in the Gulf of
Mexico, said the red tide's impact on one of Florida's most popular sport
fish was pretty light. "I think we got off pretty easy this year [2005]. We
estimate 5000 adult snook died, mostly off Sarasota and Venice, as well as
a bunch of big ones that died in Charlotte Harbor," Taylor said. "Since the
estimated snook population of the west coast is 1.3 million fish, that's
not even one percent." He worries, though, about something the scientists
cannot measure: the algal bloom's impact on unborn and just-born snook. "It
hit right in the middle of the spawning season, and while we don't think it
killed all the larval and juvenile snook as well, at this point we can't
predict its impact," Taylor said. "The sad thing, we don't know the effect
of red tide on fertilized eggs or small juveniles. How often do we see
them; they could have just dissolved."
Overall, he was optimistic about the west-coast population's ability to
replenish lost eggs and larvae. "I don't think it wiped them all out,"
Taylor said. But there is one problem area that's on the cusp. "I'd say
Charlotte Harbor may see some effects on the reproductive year class," he
said. "We may see some decreased recruitment [of adult fish into the
population]."
Given the algal bloom's longevity, its impact will likely be greater than
other blooms. "It's been going on since January [2005]," Taylor said. "The
guys who've been around here a long time say it's the worst outbreak since
1971."
The microorganism undergoes population explosions or "blooms" almost
annually off Florida's west coast. Scientists aren't sure what triggers the
blooms. None usually last as long as the current outbreak. It recently
peaked in the Tampa area. "It did a really good number on us 2 weeks ago,"
Taylor said.
Taylor recalled the sight from the Sunshine Skyway bridge. "It killed
thousands of redfish. Off the Skyway, the water looked like snow from all
the bodies. It also killed grouper, snapper and all kinds of baitfish," he
said. The state's latest Internet advisory stated that blooms exist off St.
Andrew Bay, Apalachicola Bay plus Dixie and Levy counties this week [4th
week Sep 2005].
Researchers also found high concentrations of the algae at Longboat Pass
and New Pass in the Sarasota Bay area. Farther offshore, the bloom extends
from Clearwater to Lee County. "Fish kills and some respiratory irritation
were reported from Pinellas, Sarasota, Charlotte, Lee and Collier
counties," according to the advisory. "Red tide effects may occur at beach
and bay areas as long as the bloom persists and are most noticeable when
winds are from the west."
As dire as it seems, Florida has seen worse red tides. "In the literature,
there are reports of fish kills in the millions in the 1800s," Heil said.
"One captain reported seeing dead fish from the Dry Tortugas to Fort Myers."

along the eastern US coast.
