Hepatitis A on the rise in San Miguel de Allende
------------------------------------------------
Dr Ector Jaime Ramirez-Barba, secretary of health, issued an alert
because of the increase in the number of persons infected with
hepatitis A virus in the northeastern municipalities [of the state of
Guanajuato]. The most affected area is San Miguel de Allende, where
393 cases have been reported during the past few months.

According to information released by the government agency, the
increase in hepatitis A virus infection is "because people are using
non-potable water and they do not prepare their foods in suitable
conditions."

Another municipality where a moderate increase in the number of
affected persons has been reported is Doctor Mora, with 22 registered
cases.

In comparison, the health secretary indicated that in San Miguel de
Allende 37 persons were reported as infected with hepatitis A virus in
2010, that is 356 persons less than those counted so far in 2011.

However, according to data cited by the health secretary, in the
municipalities of San Luis de la Paz and Victoria there has been a
reduction in the number of persons infected with hepatitis A virus
compared to figures from 2010.

Dr Ramirez-Barba stated that hepatitis A is an acute infectious
disease caused by a virus that leads to liver inflammation and
malfunction. This virus may be present in faeces and it enters the
body when contaminated hands, food, water, or any other object comes
into contact with the mouth. In order to prevent further transmission
of this infection, healthcare officers recommend people to wash their
hands with soap and water after going to the toilet, as well as after
changing diapers and before preparing and eating food. Also, diapers
must be changed on surfaces that can be cleaned and disinfected after
every use. Toilets must be kept clean, maintaining an adequate supply
of soap and clean towels. Only previously boiled or purified water
must be used for drinking, and preparing food under poor hygiene
conditions must be avoided.

[The extent of this outbreak suggests contamination of the public
water supply, rather than inadequate personal hygiene.
