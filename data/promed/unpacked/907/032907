[3] Transmission risks
Date: Fri 30 Sep 2022
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [abridged, edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/09/studies-detail-monkeypox-transmission-risks


A study of almost 400 samples taken from men with monkeypox reveals a high prevalence of the virus on skin, throat, and anus swabs compared with in blood or urine -- with detections in semen in the midrange -- and high viral loads in skin and anal swabs.

There are 2 other new studies that detail transmission risk in a tattoo parlor and in healthcare settings, and in US news, officials report a monkeypox-related death in Ohio.

The new analysis of 356 samples from 50 men in France infected with monkeypox shows that viral DNA detection via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was more frequent from skin (88% of men), throat (77%), and anus (71%) swabs than from semen (54%), blood (29%), or urine (22%) (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00586-2/fulltext).

The highest viral DNA loads were consistently found in skin and anus swabs, and lesions were common on the anus and genitals, which continues to suggest sexual contact as the main route of transmission. The study, published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, is one of several new studies that aim to describe real-world transmission risks of the poxvirus.

The researchers assessed viral load using cycle threshold (Ct) values, which are lower when viral loads are high. Viral loads were significantly higher from skin lesions (Ct, 19.8) and anal samples (Ct, 20.9) than from throat (27.2), semen (27.8), urine (31.1), or blood (32.8) samples.

The median age in the study was 34, with 44% of the men HIV-positive. By day 14 of swabbing, the proportion of positive samples dramatically decreased on the skin and in anus, throat, blood, urine, and semen samples.

"High MPXV viral loads from skin and mucosa, including genital and anal sites, suggest that transmission most likely occurs through direct body contact rather than through the respiratory route or contact with body fluids, which should help to refine the prevention messages delivered to individuals most exposed to the virus," the authors wrote.

They added, "The detection of MPXV at high concentrations in the anal region, in the mouth, and in semen is consistent with the sexual practices potentially involved in the spread of the virus among men who have sex with men, in addition to skin contact related to sexual or non-sexual proximity."

In a commentary on the study, Italian researchers said the findings add to a growing body of literature on monkeypox transmission, which is urgently needed as the world has seen more than 50 000 cases in the past 4 months, with 95% in men who have sex with men (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00639-9/fulltext).

"More extensive investigations are needed to obtain a coherent understanding of transmission factors that have permitted the extraordinary penetration of active MPXV infection into human communities worldwide," the authors said.

Also published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases is a report on several monkeypox cases linked to a piercing and tattoo parlor in Cadiz, Spain (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00652-1/fulltext). Of 54 exposed clients, 20 (37%) contracted the disease from 19 Jul to 3 Aug 2022.

All piercings and tattoos were performed by one female employee who did not have monkeypox but was in close contact with a possible index case on 6 Jul 2022. That person got a piercing while experiencing a rash and generalized skin inflammation.

Among the 20 exposed clients, 8 were under the age of 18 and 13 were female. In 90% of the cases, patients developed a rash at the piercing or tattoo site. Subsequent surface sampling showed extensively contaminated and unhygienic conditions, with detectable monkeypox viral DNA on work tables and chairs, and sharps and other work instruments.

"Together, these findings suggest that monkeypox virus can be transmitted through exposure to contaminated piercing or tattoo material and, potentially through contaminated hands, due to poor aseptic measures and handling of materials," the authors concluded.

[4] Incidence in unvaccinated individuals
Date: Fri 30 Sep 2022
Source: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) [edited]
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7140e3.htm


Citation: Payne AB, Ray LC, Kugeler KJ, et al. Incidence of monkeypox among unvaccinated persons compared with persons receiving ≥1 JYNNEOS vaccine dose -- 32 U.S. jurisdictions, July 31-September 3, 2022. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2022.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
------
What is already known about this topic?
Real-world monkeypox vaccine performance data are limited in the context of the ongoing monkeypox outbreak.

What is added by this report?
Across 32 US jurisdictions, among males aged 18-49 years eligible for JYNNEOS vaccination, monkeypox incidence was 14 times as high among unvaccinated males compared with those who had received a 1st vaccine dose ≥14 days earlier.

What are the implications for public health practice?
These early findings suggest that a single JYNNEOS dose provides some protection against monkeypox infection. The degree and durability of such protection is unknown, and it is recommended that persons who are eligible for monkeypox vaccination receive the complete 2-dose series.

[5] Healthcare worker infections
Date: Thu 29 Sep 2022

Citation: Steiner Salvato R, Rodrigues Ikeda ML, Bones Barcellos R, et al. Possible occupational infection of healthcare workers with monkeypox virus, Brazil. Emerg Infect Dis. 2022.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
We evaluated epidemiologic and molecular characteristics of monkeypox virus (MPXV) infections sampled from 2 healthcare nurses. In 5 days after collecting samples from an infected patient, the nurses showed typical MPXV manifestations; quantitative PCR and whole-genome sequencing confirmed MPXV infection, most likely transmitted through contact with fomites.

Conclusions
-----------
Our report provides evidence supporting the hypothesis that both HCW [healthcare worker] infections observed in this study were transmitted through fomite exposure with surfaces in the patient's home, their own PPE (disposable gown, N95 respirators, glasses), or outer surfaces of the specimen transport box. These findings highlight that MPXV might be acquired through contact with fomites, such as patient belongings or surfaces contaminated with infectious viral particles. Close interactions between patients and HCWs are also risk factors for MPXV transmission (4) [see source URL for complete references]. As notable routes of MPXV transmission, such interactions should be targeted along with diagnosis and quarantine for MPXV containment measures (4). Recommendations for preexposure and postexposure prophylaxis include correct use of appropriate PPE (10,11). Infectious MPXV particles can remain on furniture and fabric surfaces (12), so caution is needed when in contact with general protection equipment and household objects that have been exposed to suspected case-patients.

We propose specific measures to prevent and curtail monkeypox infection acquired through fomites. HCWs must be properly trained to safely collect specimens, use PPE, implement control measures, and perform frequent hand hygiene. HCWs should wear gloves throughout entire visits and during contact with possibly infected persons and their belongings. Secondly, a disinfectant product effective against microbial pathogens such as nonenveloped viruses (e.g., norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus, poliovirus) should be applied to object surfaces before and after interactions with suspected case-patients. Finally, vaccination campaigns should be conducted among high-risk groups, including certain HCWs. The possible transmission of MPXV by 2 HCWs from a patient environment illustrates a potential source of transmission with broad implications for infection control and prevention and indicates the need for specific interventions in the context of the ongoing multicountry outbreak.

[6] Myocarditis

https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/28/12/22-1276_article


Citation: Rodriguez-Nava G, Kadlecik P, Filardo TD, et al. Myocarditis attributable to monkeypox virus infection in 2 patients, United States, 2022. Emerg Infect Dis. 2022.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
We report 2 immunocompetent and otherwise healthy adults in the United States who had monkeypox and required hospitalization for viral myocarditis. Both patients were unvaccinated against orthopoxviruses. They had shortness of breath or chest pain and elevated cardiac biomarkers. No immediate complications were observed. They were discharged home after symptoms resolved.

Conclusions
-----------
The clinical course of human monkeypox is milder than that of smallpox in immunocompetent hosts (6) [see source URL for complete references]. However, severe complications have been identified, including pneumonitis, encephalitis, eyesight-threatening keratitis, secondary bacterial infections, acute kidney injury, and myocarditis (1,2,4-6). Thornhill et al (5) recently reported 2 cases of self-limited myocarditis in patients with monkeypox that resolved within 7 days without major complications; one patient had a history of HIV with a normal CD4 cell count. Similarly, the patients in our report improved 10-12 days after illness onset; one patient received tecovirimat, an inhibitor of the orthopoxvirus VP37 envelope-wrapping protein that prevents the formation of egress-competent enveloped virions and has been shown to decrease circulating viral DNA in a nonhuman primate model (7).

Many viruses have been associated with myocarditis (8,9). The most common pathophysiology of viral myocarditis is lymphocytic myocarditis associated with myonecrosis that occurs 10-14 days postinfection; illness can be either self-limiting or result in fulminant myocarditis. In some cases, viral myocarditis can progress to a noninfectious chronic phase, characterized by myocardial fibrosis, cardiac dysfunction, and dilated cardiomyopathy (9).

Myocardial involvement of orthopox infections was initially reported when myocarditis was observed after smallpox vaccination with replicating vaccinia-based vaccines in young military recruits (10). The pathophysiology of orthopox-induced myocarditis remains unknown. However, an autoimmune-mediated phenomenon has been postulated because of the absence of direct viral infection of the myocytes observed on histopathologic examination of samples from vaccinees with myocarditis (10). Most cases are mild and self-limited; major sequelae, such as dilated cardiomyopathy, are rare (11).

Hemorrhagic smallpox, the most severe manifestation of variola major, is characterized by rapid-onset fever, rash, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Anatomopathologic studies in hemorrhagic smallpox patients showed myocardial and endocardial hemorrhages (12). In a macaque model of hemorrhagic smallpox, histopathologic tests at day 6 or 7 postexposure showed acute lymphohistiocytic myocarditis with myocardiocyte degeneration and hemorrhage, primarily driven by direct viral myocardial injury and mediated by CD14 monocytes, chemotactic cytokines, and interleukin 6 (12). Therefore, we hypothesize that direct myocardial infiltration associated with monkeypox viremia may also result in myocarditis and that antiviral agents could play a role in treatment.
