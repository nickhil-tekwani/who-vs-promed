Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) cases have significantly increased in 2018, and areas of high risk continue to expand. The Swiss government is considering issuing a nationwide vaccination recommendation against the virus.

Almost 230 people have already been infected with the virus -- which in rare cases can be fatal -- since the beginning of 2018, reported Swiss Public Television, SRF, on [Tue 24 Jul 2018]. Cases have almost doubled compared to last year's figures for the same time period [2017].

In addition, the at-risk areas, where the disease is endemic, are increasing, according to the Federal Office of Public Health. The Zurich area, all of northeastern Switzerland, and large parts of cantons Bern and Aarau are all affected by the virus.

It makes little sense to recommend vaccination against the TBE virus only for certain at-risk regions, Christoph Berger, President of the Swiss Federal Commission for Vaccination, told SRF. "These areas are almost merging into each other. At some point, it becomes more reasonable and easier to make a general, nationwide vaccination recommendation," he said.

The commission had already set up a working group to consider whether the vaccination recommendation should be extended to all of Switzerland except for the canton of Ticino. So far, no cases of tick-borne encephalitis have been recorded in the Italian-speaking canton.

Such a recommendation would oblige health-insurance companies to cover the costs of the vaccination across Switzerland, not just for people who live in an at-risk zone. Complete protection against the virus requires 3 vaccinations spread over several months.

The cost of preventing diseases such as meningitis or encephalitis, which can be caused by the TBE virus, would be much lower than dealing with the complications and permanent physical damage these illnesses may cause, according to Berger.

The recommendations could come into force for the whole of German- and French-speaking Switzerland next year [2019], said Berger. His expert commission will submit a proposal to the federal government; health minister Alain Berset will make the final decision.

In Switzerland, the tick season starts in March and ends in June, depending on the weather. The health office says ticks are found mainly in deciduous forests with lush undergrowth and at an altitude of up to 1500 metres [4900 ft].

TBE-infected ticks can cause the outbreak of 2 stages of the disease. During a 1st episode, which occurs 7-14 days after the bite, patients suffer flu-like symptoms such as headaches, fever, fatigue, or joint complaints. In 5-15 percent of those affected, a 2nd stage of the illness develops, which can last for months and may involve symptoms of meningitis or encephalitis. These symptoms can cause paralysis and leave permanent disabilities. About 1 percent of cases are fatal.

Physicians in Switzerland have seen a sharp increase in the number of tick bites as well as cases of Lyme disease this year.

[As noted recently and underscored in the above report, Switzerland is experiencing a more active than usual tick-borne encephalitis virus transmission season this year (2018). The virus is endemic (and expanding) in certain areas of the country as well as in some areas of Germany and Austria. In a comment last year (2017) concerning TBE in Switzerland, Dr. Ivo M. Foppa indicated that the incidence of TBE in Switzerland has increased distinctly since 2000, roughly about 50 percent. Comparing the time period from 1985 through 2000 (average reported number of TBE per year 66) with the period from 2001 through 2016 (average reported number of TBE per year 138), the trend is even more obvious. At that time, 2017 may have been on track to exceed the number of TBE cases (245) that were reported in 2006, the record year (see ProMED-mail archive Tick-borne encephalitis - Switzerland (03): comment 20171017.5387144).

WHO has stated that "Approximately 10 000-12 000 clinical cases of tick-borne encephalitis are reported each year, but this figure is believed to be significantly lower than the actual total. Immunization offers the most effective protection. Currently, there are 4 widely used vaccines of assured quality: FSME-Immun and Encepur, manufactured in Austria and Germany, respectively, and based on European strains of the virus; and TBE-Moscow and EnceVir, manufactured in the Russian Federation and based on Far-Eastern strains. The 4 vaccines are considered to be safe and efficacious." (http://www.who.int/immunization/topics/tick_encephalitis/en/)

Tick-borne encephalitis is a virus infection caused by one of 3 tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) subtypes belonging to the _Flaviviridae_ family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected _Ixodes_ ticks. - Mod.TY
