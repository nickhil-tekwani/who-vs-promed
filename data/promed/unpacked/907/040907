"Very good Nice news from BENI! 19 Ebola patients healed left the ETC today, between them one couple!

3. I should have noted: None of the 8 #Ebola cases reported yesterday were at Goma. It's Day 9 since the last case at Goma was confirmed. Just a little under half way thru the incubation period. The wife & baby daughter of the miner are reportedly doing well. [Goma cases]

2. There've been 88 #Ebola cases so far in August (1-8). Several recent months have been worse, but that's already 70% of the total for the entire month of February [2019] -- which was just before the outbreak went [up to the] next level."

DRC: Lolwa, a new health zone affected by Ebola in Ituri
----------------------
A 1st confirmed case of Ebola virus disease has been detected in the locality of Lolwa, in Mambasa territory in Ituri province.

The 1st case is a 30-year-old woman "whose signs began to manifest in Some in the health zone of Mandima," the technical secretariat of the multisectoral committee of the response against the Ebola outbreak said in a bulletin on Fri [9 Aug 2019].

The woman "used self-medication from 3-4 Aug 2019 until she left Some for Lolwa and was hospitalized at the Lolwa General Hospital on 5 Aug 2019, whence the alert was issued.

"[She] has been investigated, validated and placed in isolation," the same source reported. She is still alive, and investigations to identify her contacts continue, according to the newsletter.

Lolwa is located 60 km [37.3 mi] east of the city of Mambasa, in the Babila Bakwanza chiefdom on the national road number 4, which connects the city of Bunia, capital of Ituri to Kisangani, chief town of Tshopo. This health zone is the 9th affected by Ebola in Ituri, the 27th in the 2 provinces (North Kivu and Ituri) devastated by the epidemic for a year.

Ituri alone recorded 175 deaths among the 318 confirmed and probable cases. The worst-hit health area is Katwa, with 451 deaths, Suovi de Beni, with 394 deaths, and Butembo with 312.

Another health area heavily affected by Ebola is Mabalako near Beni. It has already notified 282 deaths. All these localities are located in the northern part of North Kivu province.

Ebola outbreak grows by 6 in DRC
-----
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) online Ebola dashboard, the DRC confirmed 6 more Ebola cases yesterday [9 Aug 2019], raising the overall outbreak total to 2793. Health officials are still investigating 396 suspected cases. Only one new death has been recorded in the past 2 days, raising the fatality total to 1867.

In its weekly outbreak overview yesterday [9 Aug 2019], the WHO noted 257 cases in the last 21 days, or an average of 86 cases per week in the past 6 weeks. The majority of recent cases have come from Beni (46%) and Mandima (23%).

"Substantial rates of transmission continue within outbreak affected areas of North Kivu and Ituri provinces, with demonstrated extension to new high-risk areas and across borders in recent months, although without sustained local transmission in these areas," the WHO said in the Disease Outbreak News update.

No new cases have been recorded in Goma. As of 3 Aug 2019, all 256 contacts related to the 1st confirmed case in Goma Health Zone finished their 21-day follow up period. Of the 4 total cases reported in that city, 2 patients have died, and 2 are currently being treated in an Ebola treatment center. Almost all contacts (98%) in that city have been vaccinated.

Health workers continue to become infected with the deadly virus.

"In the last 21 days, 14 new cases were reported among health workers from Mandima (5), Beni (4), and one each in Katwa, Mambasa, Masereka, Oicha, and Vuhovi. Cumulatively, 149 (5% of all cases) healthcare workers have been infected to date," the WHO said.

Expert calls for new response structure
-----------------
In a new commentary on the Ebola outbreak in The Lancet Infectious Diseases [see below], renowned Ebola expert Pierre Rollin, MD, formerly of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wrote that ongoing transmission of the virus threatens to make it endemic in eastern DRC.

Rollin calls for an immediate restructuring of the Ebola response, in particular the ring vaccination campaign and contact surveillance, which he said should be streamlined with data easily shared by all major response players.

"The epidemiological data generated by the vaccination and the contact tracing teams are mostly not shared. As a result, daily field reports have noted at least 651 identified contacts of confirmed cases who were not vaccinated and became cases (among them 205 deaths) between 31 Dec 2018, and 30 Jul 2019. Vaccination coverage among health-care workers is high but incomplete," Rollin wrote.

Anti-parasitic drug eyed for Ebola treatment
------------------
In other Ebola news, a study from Boston Children's Hospital suggests that an anti-parasitic drug, nitazoxanide, enhances the immune system's ability to detect Ebola. The study was conducted in human cells and published in the journal iScience [see Research below].

Because nitazoxanide is already approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in children and adults for infections caused by giardia and cryptosporidium, it could prove to be a convenient and accessible Ebola treatment.

"Currently, there is no easily deployable therapy for Ebola virus," Anne Goldfeld, MD, of the Program in Cellular and Molecular Medicine at Boston Children's Hospital said in a press release. "There are some very promising vaccines, but there is no oral, inexpensive medication available."

Ebola veteran warns virus could become entrenched in DRC if outbreak response does not improve
--------------------

A long-time veteran of Ebola responses has raised serious concerns about the way the current outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is being handled, saying he fears transmission of the virus may not be stopped in the region.

In a commentary published in the journal _Lancet Infectious Diseases_ [see below], Dr. Pierre Rollin criticized the response for a lack of coordination and urged the DRC health ministry to accept more outside help to support laboratory services and generate real-time genetic sequencing of viruses, something authorities there have been unwilling to do so far.

The state of the outbreak, Rollin said, has not improved, and unless it does, the virus could become endemic -- entrenched -- in the region. That view is not widely shared by other Ebola experts, he acknowledged in an interview with STAT. Still, he sees it as a real possibility.

"I don't think the virus will be endemic in one town or one health area or health zone. It's going to keep moving until it moves to the place where we cannot go at all, and we have no clue of what's going on," said Rollin, who retired from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in January 2019.

"If we don't catch up, and if we don't get a good grasp on what's going on with the transmission, it's going to keep going," he said flatly. The outbreak, which has been raging for a year, has resulted in nearly 2800 infections and more than 1850 deaths to date.

Gary Kobinger, another long-time Ebola researcher and responder, doesn't agree with Rollin's prediction that the virus will become entrenched in northeastern DRC. But he does share his friend's concerns about the way the outbreak response is structured, including DRC's reluctance to accept outside laboratory help.

"If I could just give this one [piece of] advice, just open your arms and just go get the strengths wherever they are," said Kobinger, who led the work to develop the Ebola drug ZMapp and who is director of the Infectious Disease Research Center at Laval University in Quebec.

One of the major criticisms in Rollin's commentary relates to the fact that there is not one sole database used to keep track of all known cases and their contacts, an essential tool needed to trace where the virus is moving through the population.

"The different and mainly incomplete databases combined with the absence of accurate and up-to-date chains of transmission makes case counts, monitoring, and intervention difficult or even impossible," he said.

"Parallel databases should not exist," wrote Rollin, who for decades was a fixture in Ebola outbreak responses.

Rollin spent some time in the outbreak zone at the beginning of this epidemic but was pulled back to Kinshasa -- DRC's capital -- after the U.S. government deemed the area where the virus is spreading too dangerous for U.S. government employees. That prohibition, issued in late August [2018], is still in place.

Despite the fact he has retired, Rollin has deep roots in the Ebola response community and has an up-to-date understanding of how this outbreak response is functioning, a fact that was reflected in the World Health Organization's reaction to the publication of his critique.

Finding and cutting the chains of transmission are the foundation of a successful Ebola response. The goal is to find cases and care for them in isolation, where they cannot infect others; identify, vaccinate, and monitor their contacts so new cases are spotted and isolated as quickly as possible when they become symptomatic (and infectious); and bury the dead safely. Rollin noted in his commentary that the teams that go out to determine who should be offered vaccine -- contacts of cases, and contacts of the contacts are eligible -- and the surveillance teams trying to piece together where in the community Ebola is spreading are separate teams and mostly do not share information with one another. That means worried and grieving families end up talking with 2 different teams of people, asking them the same questions, he noted.

Rollin suggested a single combined team should be doing this work and that the data should be logged in a single database.

Kobinger, who traveled to the outbreak zone in late April 2019 as part of a mission to assess the response for the WHO, said the current setup is encouraging different players to hoard data so that they can publish scientific papers. "People have a vested interest in not sharing data so that they can publish them," he said.

The upshot, Rollin said, is that the percentage of new cases that come from contact lists hasn't really improved since early in the outbreak, when it was recognized as a major problem.

"For the last 8 months, there is no change in the ratio between the new confirmed case being known; followed; or known not followed; or unknown," he said. "We are behind. We stay behind for at least a year. We never succeed to get ahead."

He also expressed concern about the fact that the response effort is not identifying what are known as probable cases, people who died of Ebola-like symptoms but were never tested. Finding those cases helps the response get back on the tail of the virus. But the number of probable cases (94) hasn't changed in months, Rollin said.

Kobinger concurred: "This is the most evident symptom that proper data are not being collected. You cannot have 50% or 40% or even 10% of the people dying in the community without being associated with a chain of transmission and not have a huge amount of probable cases," he insisted, suggesting that by now there should be hundreds of probable cases on the rolls.

"Where are these cases? Well, they are feeding all these chains of transmission that are not being detected right now," Kobinger said.

Another problem Rollin raised relates to so-called nosocomial transmission of Ebola, people who are contracting the virus when they seek health care from a traditional healer, a local clinic, or a community hospital that is not set up to identify or safely treat Ebola patients.

Reuse of medical equipment -- including syringes -- is too common in these facilities, resulting in people who sought care for one ailment contracting Ebola after being given an injection with a contaminated needle.

The problem is exacerbated by the fact that many people with Ebola are turning to these health facilities for care instead of going to Ebola treatment centers, where they can be treated safely and where experimental Ebola drugs are available.

The ETCs, as they are called, are being eschewed by many of the sick, who see them as places where people go to die.

The Ebola response has been working for months to try to educate staff of these facilities on the dangers of reusing medical equipment, but the lessons haven't taken root.

"Even if the infection prevention and control efforts have yielded some progress, the relatively large proportion of cases due to reuse of material (e.g., syringes, needles, and perfusion tubes) is unacceptable," Rollin wrote.

Ebola virus disease - Democratic Republic of the Congo
----------------------
The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo continued this week with similar transmission intensity to recent weeks, with an average of 86 cases per week (range 80 to 91 cases per week) in the past 6 weeks (Figure 1). There are currently no confirmed cases of EVD outside of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

In the 21 days from 17 Jul through 6 Aug 2019, 65 health areas within 16 health zones reported new cases (Table 1, Figure 2). During this period, a total of 257 confirmed cases were reported, with the majority coming from the health zones of Beni (46%, n=119) and Mandima (23%, n=58). The majority of recent cases in Mandima Health Zone were reported from the northern health areas of Some (n=39) and Mayuano (n=8). Of the 8 cases reported in Mambasa Health Zone in the past 21 days, the majority have epidemiological links to Some Health Area, with limited local transmission in Mambasa thus far.

No new confirmed cases have been reported in Goma city since our last report, with a total of 4 confirmed cases reported from Goma (n=1) and Nyiragongo (n=3) health zones to date. Of the 4 cases, 2 have died, and 2 are in an Ebola Treatment Centre (ETC). On 3 Aug 2019, all 256 contacts related to the 1st confirmed case in Goma Health Zone (reported 14 Jul 2019), finished their 21-day follow up period. A total of 232 contacts (including 114 high risk contacts) of the Nyiragongo cases remain under surveillance. Ongoing vaccination activities have reached the majority (98%) of eligible contacts, with 1314 contacts, contacts of contacts, and frontline workers vaccinated to date.

New infections continue to be reported among personnel working in community health posts and other facilities. In the last 21 days, 14 new cases were reported among health workers from Mandima (n=5), Beni (n=4), and one each in Katwa, Mambasa, Masereka, Oicha, and Vuhovi. Cumulatively, 149 (5%) healthcare workers have been infected to date.

As of 6 Aug 2019, a total of 2781 EVD cases were reported, including 2687 confirmed and 94 probable cases, of which 1866 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (1572) were female, and 28% (791) were children aged less than 18 years.

[ReliefWeb (abridged, edited)]
https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/cerf-allocates-10-million-ebola-response-dr-congo

CERF allocates USD 10 million to the Ebola response in DR Congo
----------------------------
United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Mark Lowcock today [9 Aug 2019] announced a USD 10 million contribution from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to provide life-saving assistance to people affected by Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

"The risk of further spread -- including to neighboring countries -- is very high," said Lowcock.

The CERF funds will be used to strengthen early detection of the disease, reinforce prevention and infection control measures, provide psychosocial and nutritional support to affected people, and bolster engagement with communities, which help ensure they are receptive to the life-saving response. "The CERF funds will help us to detect more new cases faster, reduce the risk of further spread, and support people who have lost loved ones," said Lowcock. "But we urgently need donors to provide sustained funding for the response at this critical juncture."

The United Nations and partners continue to work with the government to ensure an enabling environment for the public health response, including appropriate security, logistics, political and community engagement, and action to address the concerns of affected communities.

The USD 10 million allocation is in addition to USD 4.8 million allocated by CERF to UN agencies to respond to the outbreaks in Equateur and North Kivu provinces last year [2018] and a separate USD 10 million contribution for Ebola response readiness in Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan, and Uganda.

CERF pools contributions from donors around the world into a single fund allowing humanitarian responders to deliver life-saving assistance whenever and wherever crises hit. On average, more than half of CERF-funded humanitarian action addresses the needs of women and girls.

- Thu 8 Aug 2019. Media arrested
[Al Jazeera (abridged, edited)]
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/08/ebola-drc-medics-arrested-killing-doctor-190808101648963.html

Three doctors from the Democratic Republic of the Congo have been arrested for their alleged role in the killing of a World Health Organization (WHO) doctor in April 2019, according to military prosecutors.

Cameroonian doctor Richard Mouzoko was shot and killed during an attack on a hospital in Butembo, a city in North Kivu province and an epicentre of the Ebola response in the country. He had been sent to the eastern region as part of the WHO's attempt to stop the spread of the disease's outbreak, the 2nd deadliest on record.

A military prosecutor for Butembo, Lieutenant Colonel Jean-Baptiste Kumbu, told AFP news agency on Wed [7 Aug 2019] that the arrested doctors will be charged with "terrorism" and "criminal conspiracy."

The 3 medics are accused of holding meetings on 14 Apr 2019 to plot the assassination of Mouzoko, the prosecutor said. A 4th doctor suspected to be involved in the 19 Apr 2019 killing is still at large, he added.

Kumbu said captured members of an armed group believed to be behind the killings implicated the 4 doctors during interrogations.

Prosecutors did not allege a motive for the arrested health workers, but a treatise left behind at the attack site had previously led prosecutors to believe the assailants belonged to the armed group, the Patriotic Union for the Liberation of Congo, the Reuters news agency had reported at the time.

The arrests were decried by doctors in Butembo. ln a letter to the mayor of the city, the local branch of the DRC's national doctors' council said they would go on strike if their colleagues were not released within 48 hours.

Medics in Butembo had previously protested and threatened to strike if security was not increased for health workers in the area. "This is causing a great deal of concern," said Al Jazeera's Malcolm Webb, reporting from Nairobi, the capital of neighbouring Kenya.

"With the outbreak of the Ebola crisis going on, people are very worried about the consequences of a strike of medical staff going ahead." The DRC's coordinator for Ebola response, Jean-Jacques Muyembe, called the investigation a "delicate situation. As a man has died, we absolutely have [to] know the truth about what happened," he told AFP.

An unofficial tally puts the number of health workers killed at 7, with more than 50 seriously wounded since the start of the outbreak, which has been declared a public health emergency of international concern.

Abstract
As of 16 Jun 2019, an Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak has led to 2136 reported cases in the northeastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). As this outbreak continues to threaten the lives and livelihoods of people already suffering from civil strife and armed conflict, relatively simple mathematical models and their short-term predictions have the potential to inform Ebola response efforts in real time. We applied recently developed non-parametrically estimated Hawkes point processes to model the expected cumulative case count using daily case counts from 3 May 2018 to 16 Jun 2019, initially reported by the Ministry of Health of DRC and later confirmed in World Health Organization situation reports. We generated probabilistic estimates of the ongoing EVD outbreak in DRC extending both before and after 16 Jun 2019, and evaluated their accuracy by comparing forecasted vs. actual outbreak sizes, out-of-sample log-likelihood scores and the error per day in the median forecast. The median estimated outbreak sizes for the prospective 3-, 6-, and 9-week projections made using data up to 16 Jun 2019, were, respectively, 2317 (95% PI: 2222, 2464); 2440 (95% PI: 2250, 2790); and 2544 (95% PI: 2273, 3205). The 9-week projection experienced some degradation with a daily error in the median forecast of 6.73 cases, while the 6- and 3-week projections were more reliable, with corresponding errors of 4.96 and 4.85 cases per day, respectively. Our findings suggest the Hawkes point process may serve as an easily-applied statistical model to predict EVD outbreak trajectories in near real-time to better inform decision-making and resource allocation during Ebola response efforts.

Summary
Here, we show that the US Food and Drug Administration-approved oral drug nitazoxanide (NTZ) broadly amplifies the host innate immune response to viruses and inhibits Ebola virus (EBOV) replication. We find that NTZ enhances retinoic-acid-inducible protein I (RIG-I)-like-receptor, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein, interferon regulatory factor 3, and interferon activities and induces transcription of the antiviral phosphatase GADD34. NTZ significantly inhibits EBOV replication in human cells through its effects on RIG-I and protein kinase R (PKR), suggesting that it counteracts EBOV VP35 protein's ability to block RIG-I and PKR sensing of EBOV. NTZ also inhibits a 2nd negative-strand RNA virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), through RIG-I and GADD34, but not PKR, consistent with VSV's distinct host innate immune evasion mechanisms. Thus, NTZ counteracts varied virus-specific immune evasion strategies by generally enhancing the RNA sensing and interferon axis that is triggered by foreign cytoplasmic RNA exposure and holds promise as an oral therapy against EBOV.
