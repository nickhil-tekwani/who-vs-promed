The World Health Organization (WHO) is urgently assessing the local
outbreak of scarlet fever -- which by last night [22 Jun 2011] had
killed 2 children and sickened nearly 500. However, for now there is
still no evidence of spread, according to Ailan Li, WHO's medical
officer, emerging disease surveillance and response. Hong Kong
reported an increase in the number of cases to the UN health agency,
which prompted the risk assessment. "WHO is checking with mainland
China and Macau, but being the big country it is, the surveillance
team has yet to give a more detailed report," Li added.

The Centre for Health Protection last night [22 Jun 2011] confirmed
that a 5 year old boy with chickenpox, who died on Tuesday morning [21
Jun 2011] in Princess Margaret Hospital, was a victim of scarlet
fever. His death follows that of a 7 year old girl, who died on 29 May
2011 of the disease, caused by the bacterium Group A _Streptococcus
pyogenes_.

Both died of toxic shock syndrome -- where toxins from the bacteria
poison blood capillaries. Test results for scarlet fever are pending
for the boy's brothers, aged 7 and 13, the center said. A spokesman
for the center said "most scarlet fever cases were sporadic without
epidemiological linkage."

In addition, 28 children -- 11 boys and 17 girls aged 1 to 10 -- were
reported with scarlet fever in the 24 hours to noon yesterday [22 Jun
2011], taking the total to 494 this year.

One new outbreak at Yan Chai Hospital Tung Pak Ying Kindergarten in
Kwai Tsing involved 2 children. So far only the nursery of the dead
boy -- Salvation Army Tin Ka Ping Kindergarten in Sha Tin -- has been
closed. Infectious diseases specialist Lo Wing-lok said chickenpox may
compromise a child's immunity, making them susceptible to infections.
As chickenpox causes tiny blisters on the skin, this makes it open
targets "for streptococcus invasion."

Health chief York Chow Yat-ngok called for timely treatment with
"appropriate antibiotics." University of Hong Kong microbiology
professor Yuen Kwok-yung warned doctors and parents not to abuse
antibiotics in light of the finding that erythromycin is ineffective
for the scarlet fever being seen locally. Penicillin or 1st-generation
cephalosporin is instead a must. "The infected child who was admitted
to Queen Mary Hospital [and died] was given the wrong antibiotics
earlier [by a private doctor]. Taking antibiotics left and right does
not help you very much," Yuen said.

A variant strain discovered by the university in a boy who remains in
intensive care in hospital may account for the unusually high number
of cases this year [2011].

[According to the news release above, the total number of cases in
Hong Kong is now 494. We continue to await further information on the
extent of the outbreak in neighboring China. Updated information on
the epidemiology of the outbreak in the affected regions and the
characteristics of the strains of _Streptococcus pyogenes_ involved
would be useful and most appreciated.
