[Tolebiyskiy is in the Qaraghandy region of South Kazakhstan. This is well shown in the OIE website. It would seem to be a seasonal continuation of the previous outbreak reported by OIE on 21 Jul 2021, listed below in the See Also section. Whether they are epidemiologically related is unknown, but with 21 of 259 cattle clinically affected and dead, we can assume that tabanid biting flies played a part, and probably some 50 animals will have been infected, survived, and have antibodies. With a farm with such large numbers of sheep, horses, and cattle, it is vital to have promptly vaccinated them, as well as the livestock on surrounding farms and communities.

The control of anthrax in Kazakhstan in the post-Soviet era has been in the eastern and southeastern provinces. Appearances outside this region can catch ranchers and veterinary services unprepared. - Mod.MHJ
