New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak Location Bago (Oatsu Quarter)
Species Birds
Susceptible 33 859
Cases 400
Deaths 400
Destroyed 33 459
Slaughtered 0
Affected population 32 070 quail, 3118 quail eggs, 52 kg of feed,

all destroyed.

Outbreak statistics
Species Birds Apparent morbidity rate 1.18 percent
Apparent mortality rate 1.18 percent
Apparent case fatality rate 100.00 percent
Proportion susceptible removed* 100.00 percent
* Removed from the susceptible population either through death,
destruction or slaughter

Epidemiology: Source of infection. Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: Thanatpin is considered as a high risk
township by international epidemiologists because it is very close to
lake Moeyungyi, occupied by wild birds, with a high population of
ducks (nearly 800 000) and with a rapidly increasing number of raised
quails. The source of infection is probably seropositive ducks,
infecting quail or chickens and other fomites.

[The location of Bago division, which is also known as Pegu, can be
seen in the OIE posting referenced above or at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bago,_Burma>.
It is north and west of the outbreaks reported in September 2007,
although there were outbreaks reported from Bago division previously
in June 2007; see Avian influenza (100): Myanmar, OIE 20070614.1940.

This is a relatively large population that exhibits a high case
fatality rate, reminding us again that this disease is devastating
when this particular virulent avian influenza strain spills over into
susceptible populations. It would be interesting and informative to
obtain sequential surveillance data on the large duck population
housed on lake Moeyungyi. - Mod.PC]
