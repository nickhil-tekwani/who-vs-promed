Florida citrus canker battle seen lasting 2 years
-----------------------------------
It will take at least 2 more years to halt an outbreak of citrus canker
[CC] that already has forced Florida's commercial growers to destroy more
than 5 percent of their trees, officials in the $9.1 billion industry said
on Wednesday.
Florida produces more than 75 percent of the United States' citrus fruit,
and its 10-year campaign to eradicate CC suffered a devastating blow in
2004, when a trio of hurricanes spread the canker-causing bacterium
_Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pv. _citri_ [ Xac] through the state's commercial
groves.
"We're probably realistically looking at a 2-year period for removing and
controlling everything that we have identified so far," said Denise Feiber,
spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Agriculture. "But, if we have
another hurricane season like we did last year, then we're going to be
re-evaluating."
A year ago, 15 of Florida's 67 counties had citrus canker, but it was
confined mainly to backyard trees in residential areas of southern Florida
and the state Division of Plant Industry expected to eradicate it by early
2006. It has now spread to 22 counties, and since January has been
confirmed in the major orange- and grapefruit-growing regions of Polk, St.
Lucie and Indian River counties in central Florida. Scientists know the
infection was weatherborne because they found large quantities of bacteria
on the tops of huge swaths of trees, Feiber said.
The rate of new finds has slowed since the first of the year, but
inspectors are still finding one or 2 new infection sites per week,
including some at nurseries that supplied commercial groves. "The numbers
are certainly at the manageable stage, still," Feiber said.
The Florida and U.S. Departments of Agriculture expect to complete a survey
of the commercial groves by the end of August to determine just how far CC
has spread.
Citrus trees within 1900 feet of infected plants must be destroyed to halt
CC, and commercial growers have been forced to burn 5 million of their 98
million trees, half of them since January, Feiber said. 29 500 acres of
commercial groves have been lost to CC, or about 4 percent of Florida's total.
"It's very depressing for the industry right now," said Casey Pace,
spokeswoman for Florida Citrus Mutual, the state's largest growers association.
Canker does not harm humans or animals but causes brown lesions on the
trees and fruit, which leads to premature fruit drop and reduced yields of
30-50 percent. Letting CC rampage unchecked through Florida's groves would
cost growers $342 million a year in lowered yields and loss of sales due to
blemished fruit, Pace said.
Fighting the outbreak has cost $500 million since the current infection was
first discovered on a grapefruit tree near Miami International Airport in
1995. Growers spend $20 million a year just disinfecting workers and
equipment to keep them from carrying Xac to new areas, Pace said.
Quarantine rules, in effect for parts of 15 counties, prohibit movement of
fruit and plants from infected areas and bar new planting for 2 years. It
takes another 2 to 7 years for the trees to start producing.
"It's a 10-year setback," Pace said. "They have to start all the way over
from scratch."

[This report realistically summarizes the current CC situation in southern
Florida. Meteorologists and hurricane experts will be assessing the
likelihood that Hurricane Dennis may strike citrus groves in southern
Florida. Should that happen, the outlook for citrus producers will likely
worsen. - Mod.DH]
