Jesus Querales, Chief of the Diagnostic Division of the National Institute
of Health, reported that an increase in the number of cases of dengue is
expected because of heavy rains and the consequent increase in breeding
grounds for mosquitoes.
In Venezuela, viral serotypes 1, 2, and 4 are present. But in the last
epidemiological briefing by the Ministry of Health and Social Assistance
(MHSA), an alert was issued over the possible presence of serotype 3 in the
country.
Venezuela and the rest of Latin America are going through the same
experience as in Southeast Asia: several viral subtypes are present
simultaneously, there are frequent epidemics, cases of hemorrhagic dengue
are reported, and mortality increases.
Coincident with the expected rise in cases, a new manual on diagnosis,
treatment and control of the disease produced by various national health
agencies, is being sent to physicians. Laboratory confirmation of dengue
currently takes about 10 to 14 days and is performed by the National
Institute of Hygiene in centers that operate in Zulia, Falcon, Lara,
Barinas, Anzoategui and Aragua.

[Confirmation by serology may take 10-14 days (the time it takes to obtain
a second, early convalescent-phase, serum) but virus isolation can be done
in less than that. In such epidemiologically crucial situations, one may
have to be satisfied with "presumptive" diagnoses until such time as second
sera can be obtained and confirmations made. The situation in Venezuela
sounds critical. - Mod.CHC
