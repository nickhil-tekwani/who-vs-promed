>From 2002 to 2003, symptoms suggestive of Apple mosaic virus (ApMV; a
member of the genus Ilavirus) infection on apple (_Malus pumila_ L.)
trees were observed in orchards in the central Anatolia region of
Turkey. Symptoms on leaves included pale-to-bright cream spots,
mosaic, and yellowing on the leaves.
A survey was conducted during May and June 2005 in 3 provinces
(Isparta, Karaman, and Nigde) for disease symptoms. Leaf samples from
apple cvs. Anna, Gala, Gold Star, Golden Delicious, Granny Smith,
Jonathan, Starking, and Rajka were collected and tested for the
presence of ApMV with specific antisera (Agdia, Elkhart, IN) using
the manufacturer's protocol for double-antibody sandwich
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA).
ApMV was found in 68.3 percent of 461 samples tested. The number of
samples for each cultivar tested and percent positive for ApMV were
as follows: 22 (9.1 percent), 34 (8.8 percent), 22 (13.6 percent), 30
(73.3 percent), 270 (95.5 percent), 46 (54.3 percent), and 22 (9.1
percent) for cvs. Anna, Gala, Gold Star, Golden Delicious, Granny
Smith, Starking, and Rajka, respectively. All 15 samples tested of
cv. Jonathan were negative using DAS-ELISA.
Samples that tested positive for ApMV were mechanically inoculated
onto _Chenopodium amaranticolor_, _C. quinoa_, and _Cucumis sativus_
leaves using an inoculum prepared by homogenizing leaves in phosphate
buffered saline containing 2.5 percent (vol/vol) nicotine. Inoculated
_C. quinoa_ showed inconspicuous mottling, and _Cucumis sativus_
showed chlorotic local lesions that progressed to systemic chlorosis
and stunting.
No symptoms were observed on inoculated _C. amaranticolor_ as
previously reported for ApMV (3,4). The presence of ApMV in _C.
quinoa_ and _Cucumis sativus_ were verified using DAS-ELISA, but ApMV
was not detected in _C. amaranticolor_.
Although ApMV has been reported in several different crops in Turkey,
there have been only 2 unsubstantiated reports of ApMV-infected apple
in the country (1,2).
This study conclusively demonstrates ApMV infection of apples in
Turkey and suggests that it is widely spread.

[Apple mosaic virus (ApMV), one of the oldest known and most
widespread apple viruses, is probably distributed worldwide. It used
to be rare in European apple trees but was disseminated by widespread
distribution of the 1st infected Granny Smith clones, where it is
latent and produces no symptoms. It can also cause line pattern
symptoms in plum. ApMV is related to Prunus necrotic ringspot virus.
ApMV-infected apple trees develop pale to bright cream spots on
spring leaves as they expand. These spots may become necrotic after
exposure to summer sun and heat. Most commercial cultivars are
affected, but vary in severity of symptoms. Golden Delicious and
Jonathan are severely affected, whereas Winesap and Mclntosh are only
mildly affected. Except in severe cases, a crop can still be produced
by infected trees; yield reductions vary from 0 to 50 percent. In
some cultivars, bud set is severely affected. ApMV is transmitted by
mechanical inoculation and root grafting, possibly not transmitted by pollen
to the pollinated plant. Disease management basically consists of digging up
infected trees and destroying them.
