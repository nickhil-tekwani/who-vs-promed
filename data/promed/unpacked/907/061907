["Crayfish plague is a highly infectious disease of all crayfish of non-North American origin. The aetiological agent is an oomycete fungus, _Aphanomyces astaci_, which is now widespread in Europe as well as in North America.

"The disease first occurred in Europe in the 3rd quarter of the 19th century in the Franco-German border region. From there, a steady spread of infection occurred, principally in 2 directions, down the Danube into the Balkans and towards the Black Sea, and across the north German plain into Russia and from there south to the Black Sea and north-west to Finland and finally, in 1907, to Sweden. In the 1960s the 1st outbreaks in Spain were reported and in the 1980s further spread of infection to the British Isles, Turkey, Greece, and Norway was reported.

"The European crayfish species, the noble crayfish _Astacus astacus_ of north-west Europe, the stone crayfish _Austropotamobius pallipes_ of south-west and west Europe, the related _Austropotamobius torrentium_ (mountain streams of south-west Europe), and the slender clawed or Turkish crayfish _Astacus leptodactylus_ of eastern Europe and Asia Minor are all highly susceptible."
