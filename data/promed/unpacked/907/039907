57 children and adolescents attending different schools in Montmarault (Allier) showed the same symptoms on Thu [15 Jun 2017]: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.

16 absences were recorded in nursery school, 26 in elementary school, and 15 in college. However, not all of them had lunch at the canteen. External students have also been affected.

Are the water or meals taken in common at the canteen by all the affected students responsible? Is this a virus? We still do not know. The necessary action has already been undertaken to have an answer as soon as possible.

Everything has been done pending the results of the samples.

Tests made by the Regional Health Agency and the departmental council were carried out on the various items served at lunch. Samples were also taken from the water. The results of these analyses could be known over next week.

Bottles of water were bought and distributed to the students. The consumption of tap water was suspended until further notice at the college.

On Friday [16 Jun 2017], there were still 23 absences in kindergarten and 40 in primary school, while the number of absent schoolchildren was stable.

Four Kiwi families flew to Fiji for a fabulous week together in luxury accommodation after a year of planning and saving. But things went awry when all but 2 of the group of adults and children were struck down by a mystery sickness shortly after arrival.

Vomiting, diarrhoea, cramps and chills confined them to their rooms, which were at a 5-star accommodation in Denarau, near Nadi and at another resort on Malolo Island. "It was almost like a domino effect. It was picking off one person at a time," said [Male B], a former ad executive who now runs a dairy farm near New Plymouth.

"The whole time we were there, there was always someone down with it. We never all got to spend an evening together."

They still have no clue whether the gastro-type sickness came from water, food, the aircraft, airport, hotel rooms, or elsewhere. But they are warning others to be careful.

"We tried to nail it down. We couldn't put our finger on it," he said.

[Male B] said they used only bottled water for drinking and teeth cleaning. They stayed and ate at a 5-star accommodation Sheraton on Denaurau, near Nadi, and also stayed on Manolo Island at the Plantation Resort.

They met other visitors to Fiji who had also come down with a similar illness, including wedding guests who were too unwell to attend the event. There was also evidence of people having been ill on the plane.

Most of the group got better in a day or 2, but one woman continued to feel unwell for several days. Her family doctor put her on a drip for several hours after she returned to Auckland because she had become so dehydrated.

[Female S], who didn't want her last name used, said the medical centre sent a sample for testing, but no results have yet come back.

"It wasn't pretty" she said of her symptoms. "Was it the water? The hygiene? Is it a superbug? I'm really keen to know." she said. "We got sick at different times during the week in Fiji. Every single night, someone was sick. They were dropping like flies."

Dr David Sinclair from the Auckland Regional Public Health Service said gastroenteritis in travellers returning from Pacific and Asian countries was common, as their water supplies and food were easily contaminated.

Illness ranged from a mild upset stomach to severe vomiting and diarrhoea.

"It is important people visit the doctor if they suspect gastroenteritis from food or water contamination," he said. A positive result from testing in New Zealand would be reported to public health officials.

Sinclair advised travellers to such countries to eat food that has been thoroughly cooked, and only drink bottled water or sealed cold drinks. People with vomiting and diarrhoea should keep well hydrated and thoroughly wash their hands, and usually symptoms cleared in a few days, he said. If severe symptoms develop then people are advised to visit a doctor.

[A number of agents can cause gastroenteritis:

Norovirus. Both children and adults are affected by noroviruses, the most common cause of foodborne illness worldwide. Norovirus infection can sweep through families and communities. It's especially likely to spread among people in confined spaces. In most cases, you pick up the virus from contaminated food or water, although person-to-person transmission also is possible.

Rotavirus. Worldwide, this is the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis in children, who are usually infected when they put their fingers or other objects contaminated with the virus into their mouths. The infection is most severe in infants and young children. Adults infected with rotavirus may not have symptoms but can still spread the illness, a particular concern in institutional settings because infected adults unknowingly can pass the virus to others. A vaccine against viral gastroenteritis is available in some countries, including the United States, and appears to be effective in preventing the infection [However, since adults and children were infected in Fiji, the etiologic agent is likely not rotavirus. - Mod.LK].

Some shellfish, especially raw or undercooked oysters, also can make you sick. Although contaminated drinking water is a cause of viral diarrhea, in many cases, the virus is passed through the fecal-oral route, that is, someone with a virus handles food you eat without washing his or her hands after using the toilet [excerpted from http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/viral-gastroenteritis/basics/causes/con-20019350].

Bacteria. Although not as common, bacteria such as _E. coli_ and salmonella can also trigger the stomach flu. Salmonella and campylobacter bacteria are the most common bacterial causes of gastroenteritis in the U.S. and are usually spread by undercooked poultry, eggs, or poultry juices. Salmonella can also be spread through pet reptiles or live poultry.

Fiji, officially the Republic of Fiji, is an island country in Melanesia in the South Pacific Ocean, about 1100 nautical miles northeast of New Zealand's North Island. Its closest neighbours are Vanuatu to the west, New Caledonia to the southwest, New Zealand's Kermadec Islands to the southeast, Tonga to the east, the Samoas and France's Wallis and Futuna to the northeast, and Tuvalu to the north.

http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-issues-warning-on-several-raspberry-products-due-to-norovirus-risk-1.4176504


The Quebec Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAPAQ) has issued a warning list of raspberry and raspberry products that may have been contaminated by the norovirus.

Several cases of illness have already been reported to the ministry.

Those who have products on the list are asked to avoid consuming them and return them to the facility where they were purchased or discard them.

"The products that are the subject of this alert are likely to have been prepared with a batch of frozen raw raspberries that are subject to a food recall from the Canadian Inspection Agency," wrote the agency in an issued statement on Fri [23 Jun 2017].

People with norovirus will experience symptoms usually between 24 and 48 hours after consuming the products.

Those symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, muscle pain, fatigue, fever, chills and headaches.

"Even if the products do not show signs of alteration or suspicious odour, they are likely to be contaminated with norovirus," wrote the ministry.
