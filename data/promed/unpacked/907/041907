Fake anti-malarials are widespread
------------------------------
The discovery of an counterfeit ring in Kenya
dealing with artemisinin-based anti-malarials has
raised fears of the emergence of resistance by
the malaria parasite against the only category of
drugs that is fully effective against the killer fever.
The Chinese drug-maker Holley-Cotec
Pharmaceuticals announced 2 weeks ago [20-24 Aug
2007] that it was withdrawing at least 20 000
doses of Duo-cotecxin, an artemisinin-based
anti-malarial, after it discovered that the
Kenyan market had been flooded with counterfeits.
Duo-cotecxin is a World Health Organisation (WHO)
pre-qualified anti-malarial which contains
artemisinin, an ingredient that has been used to
treat fevers in China for the past 2000 years.
The counterfeits of the medicine in Kenya were
being sold for less than USD 1, while the genuine
medicine goes for about USD 5.
According to Eric Law, Holley-Cotec
Pharmaceuticals' vice-president, laboratory
analysis of the counterfeits had revealed that
they contained low levels of the active
ingredients, meaning that patients who took them would not be cured of malaria.
Poorly formulated medicines, as well as wrong
usage by patients such as failure to finish
doses, sharing of one patient's medicines among
relatives and friends in a bid to cut costs, and
inadequate prescriptions are the key factors that
lead to the emergence of resistance by pathogens
such as malaria's _Plasmodium falciparum_.
Malaria experts say that these factors were
instrumental in the development of resistance
against such drugs as chloroquine and
sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), which were
previously highly effective against the disease
but which now have very low cure rates.
Resistance to chloroquine by the malaria parasite
was first detected in Kenya in 1984 while that
against SP formulations started to emerge in the late 1990s.
According to Dr. Willy Akwale, the head of
Kenya's malaria control programme, the recent
discovery of the Duo-cotecxin counterfeits was
the first the country had made of significant
quantities of fake artemisinin-based anti-malarials.
Kenya adopted a drug, Coartem, in the same class
to be the first-line treatment in government
hospitals in April 2004 following recommendations
by the WHO and funding to the tune of USD 34 million from the Global Fund.
According to Mr. Law, Holley-Cotec will endeavour
to locate the counterfeit's source before
re-issuing Duo-cotecxin in Kenya. There was
already evidence however, he added, that the
fakes originated from an Asian country.
"We are now going to introduce a new technology
to tamper-proof the doses that will be supplied
to replace the withdrawn drugs," Mr. Law told the BBC news website.
In Asia, the problem of counterfeit
anti-malarials has reached epidemic levels in
such countries as Cambodia, Thailand and China,
where backstreet laboratories churn out millions
of doses for both local consumption and export,
mainly to poorly regulated African countries.

[False drugs, not only artemisinins, are a huge
and increasing problem in Asia and Africa, and
the problem is recognized by the WHO: (see
<http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/84/9/06-010906/en/index.html>).
It is not only a problem for antimalarials but
also for drugs against HIV and other common
infections. The problem of fake artemisinins in
Asia was highlighted last year [2006] in a paper
by Newton et al. (Manslaughter by Fake
Artesunate in Asiaï¿½Will Africa Be Next? PLoS Med
2006;3:752-5.
(doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.0030197)). The study by
Newton et al., the WHO report and the current
report cited here shows that fake drugs is an
increasing and huge problem in resource poor countries.
For the indigenous population it means that
effective treatment bought at local pharmacies
and markets cannot be depended on, and for the
travelers to these areas, drugs should be brought
from home. Outbreaks of malaria despite
availability of drugs should raise the question
if the drugs really contain the active substance.
It also means that a report of "resistance" must
take into consideration [the possibility] that a
little or non-effective drug was given. - Mod.EP]
