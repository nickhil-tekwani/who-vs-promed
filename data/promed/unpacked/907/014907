The District Director of Environmental Health wrote to inform us:
"All of Georgia laboratory tests were confirmed by the CDC. The
results indicate the raccoon was negative but the dog was positive
with raccoon variant rabies virus. The dog in question came from
Tennessee and may have been exposed there. It is possible a short
incubation period could place exposure in Georgia."

[We appreciate Mr. King providing information on the strain of virus.
This case is quite a mystery. We will look forward to more
information as the mystery unravels. - Mod.TG]
