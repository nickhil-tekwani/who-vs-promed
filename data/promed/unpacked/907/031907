Hendra claims 10th NSW horse
----------------------------
The hendra virus has claimed the life of another horse on the north
coast of New South Wales (NSW). The animal was found dead on a
property north of Ballina on Sunday morning [28 Aug 2011]. The horse
is the 10th in NSW to have died because of the virus in little more
than 2 months. The property where the latest NSW infection took place
has been placed under quarantine.

Hendra [virus] has also claimed the lives of 11 horses in Queensland,
with the most recent near the Gold Coast a week ago.

There have been previous cases near Ballina, and also other locations
including Lismore, Mullumbimby and Macksville. A senior vet with the
NSW Department of Primary Industries, Ian Roth, says fruit bats infect
the horses. "We have had other properties at Ballina, and they're not
connected with those other properties at all," he said.

"It's all to do with the fact that the flying fox excretes the virus
and then the horse develops it from eating fruit or flowers or things
that have been contaminated with the virus from the flying foxes."

[When the bats consume the fruit, they drop lots of fruit fiber and
some juices likely from the fruit they consume. The horses probably
come along and eat the fiber flavored by the juice, and in so doing
consume the virus, to which they are very susceptible.

While I recognize it is difficult to give up good fruit trees, fencing
them out of the paddock may be the only alternative to try and protect
horses until the vaccine comes out. - Mod.TG
