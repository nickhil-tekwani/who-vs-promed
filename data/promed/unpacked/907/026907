re: Anthrax, bovine - Canada (04): (SK) bison
---------------------------------------------
I can add to some information, from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency
(CFIA) point of view. We actually got positive anthrax from 8 of the PANP
[Prince Albert National Park -- 20080826.2670] wild bison. Started with 4
quite decomposed samples, and got 2 or 3 day-dead samples and then 2
samples from less than 24 hour dead carcasses, while the 1st 4 were being
processed. More samples taken, since were not sure would get culture from
the decomposing carcasses. All were anthrax positive. There were cases near
the Park in 2006, and the Park would have been subject to the same flooding
conditions then, with this summer being dry. 2 domestic cases are in Rural
Municipalities [RM 555, Big River -- 20080812.2500 -- and RM520,
Paddockwood -- 20080726.2286, 20080727.2297] on either side of the Park,
but not close. 3 bison died outside the Park, in one case in a pasture. We
will treat this as a contaminated premises, and ensure carcass disposal,
apply quarantine and supply vaccine for the cattle. Around the PA park it
was generally a cooler summer until August [2008] when there were a couple
weeks of hot weather.

In domestic animals this year [23008], there have been 5 premises involved,
widely dispersed geographically. In 2 instances [RM 555, Big River --
20080812.2500 -- and RM 367, Ponass Lake -- there were cases here in 2006]
there was only 1 animal (cow in 1 case, bull in the other) confirmed with
anthrax. In the case of the cow, there were preceding deaths, but carcasses
were checked and PMs [postmortems] performed on some, and anthrax was not
suspected (blood clotted, normal-sized spleens) and in 1 case was anthrax
negative (though quite autolyzed). The bull was the 2nd bull to die in a
week, but the 1st death is undiagnosed. Usual control activities, including
vaccination occurred.

The 1st outbreak in May [RM 256, King George -- 20080726.2286 ] had 13 dead
animals (cows) upon discovery. Vaccination has occurred, cattle were moved,
and no further deaths. Interestingly, some farmed bison had died on that
same pasture last summer [2007], and were not reported, as the owner
believed it was blue-green algae poisoning, which had been diagnosed in the
area. Those carcasses were not cleaned up. After the cattle deaths this
year, CFIA took samples from some of the dead bison remains, and anthrax
was cultured from one of them. Bison carcass clean-up was attempted, along
with cattle carcasses this year, but that pasture would be quite likely
heavily contaminated with spores. The cattle were moved on to that pasture
7 May 2008, with 1st death 15 May 2008, 9 more 20 May 2008, and 2 more and
1 noted depressed; all the latter died 21 May 2008. Cows were moved off the
pasture 20 May 2008. No further deaths after removed from pasture [except
those already noted to be ill]. Sandy soil, short but adequate, native
pasture and alfalfa, dry to normal conditions. It had been a slower, cooler
spring. Weather data fits, with highs in mid teens (Celsius, or low 50s'F)
for that location until the week of 15 May 2008, when it increased to mid
twenties for about a week.

The last bovine outbreak [RM 316, Harris -- 20080812.2500] has had 8 deaths
now, all beef cattle, with the most recent one on Tuesday [August 26], 11
days after vaccination. This is in an area where 2 herds were diagnosed
with anthrax in 1994. All premises are located along a creek, although this
year's case is actually upstream to the historic cases. Surprisingly, few
of the neighbours have vaccinated against anthrax, or are planning to.

The domestic bison [RM 520, Paddockwood] herd had 8 deaths total,
vaccination has not occurred due to handling difficulties. Antibiotics were
given in water, and seemed to have been effective. There does not appear to
be local spread.

Vaccination levels this year are down significantly from 2007 levels.
Checking with the vaccine distribution company, which is sales to
veterinary clinics, and does not track actual use, shows one 3rd the sales
as last year; about 200K doses as opposed to >600K in 2007 in SK. Not
totally valid comparison, since there may have been carry over of stocks
from 2007 that were sold this spring. Based on approx 1.4 million beef cows
and around 3 million beef cattle in the province, this is not 'widespread'
vaccination.

We did do a widespread promotion of vaccination this spring, but with very
few cases last year, complacency takes over.

[Our thanks to Betty for this very thorough and useful report. CFIA manages
anthrax outbreaks in Canada. It is clear that the weather played a part in
this both in encouraging Spring grazing growth in a heavily contaminated
pasture in King George RM. And one could speculate that the park bison were
protected by the cooler weather until the high temperatures crashed their
innate resistance, when the ongoing level of exposure could not be
effectively handled and infection occured. It is unusual to see deaths more
than 8 days after vaccination. These were all beef cattle; with dairy cows
vaccination failures have been ascribed to similtaneous mastitis treatment
with antibiotics but that would not apply with beef cows. Such late deaths
occur but frankly it is not common.

If nothing else this is a good example of the frequency of widely dispersed
sporadic outbreaks in a region with a history of epidemics; and therefore
the importance of maintaining vaccination, at least until the true risk is
minimal. - Mod.MHJ]
