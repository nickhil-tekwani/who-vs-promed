The posting above included the following commentary:

"According to the information from the Schleswig-Holstein Agriculture Minister [in the cited media report], HPAI H5N5 has been recorded in wildfowl in Israel. The source of this information and its confirmation, or otherwise, are requested. Israel submitted on 24 Jan 2016 its 5th follow-report on the HPAI H5N8 event, which has been spreading throughout the country, specifying 9 species of wildfowl recently found infected in 3 locations (see, with map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=22541)".

Following an inquiry we are able publish the following:

"From a reliable source we have noted that, as of today, Wed 1 Feb 2017, no H5N5 cases, in poultry or wildfowl, have been found in Israel. All reported events were H5N8".

[In view of the recent detection of HPAI H5N5 in several European countries, in wildfowl (Netherlands, Germany, Croatia, Montenegro, and Greece) and in several commercial poultry farms (Germany), the veterinary investigation/surveillance institutions in other H5N8-infected countries should be encouraged to pay attention to the differentiation of the N (neuraminidase) component of each HPAI virus strain under testing. As observed in the Netherlands, mixed H5N8/H5N5 infections may occur (see commentary in 20161216.4701594).

Referring to the HPAI H5N8 situation in Israel, subscribers are referred to today's (1 Feb 2017) fresh news: "Israel, which reported several outbreaks of H5N8 in wild birds, chickens and turkeys, reported for the 1st time an outbreak in breeding ducks. The farm is located in Beit Halevi (Central part of Israel). 1300 ducks were culled." (see at http://www.poultrymed.com/Poultrymed/Templates/showpage.asp?DBID=1&LNGID=1&TMID=178&FID=1908&PID=0&IID=50342). - Mod.AS
