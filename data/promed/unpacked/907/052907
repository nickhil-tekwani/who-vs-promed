I was surprised to read in moderator CHC's comment that hepatitis E virus
has been classified into the family caliciviridae, genus calicivirus.
To my knowledge, hepatitis E virus is still unclassified. The open
question seemed to be whether it is a family of its own or indeed belongs
to the family of caliciviridae. I never saw it classified into the genus
calicivirus. Could you please check that point as some textbooks give
differing information on the taxonomy of HEV?
