Hunter beekeepers are being urged to safeguard their hives after a serious pest was detected in hives at the Port of Newcastle.

The state government says swift measures have been taken after _Varroa_ mite was uncovered during biosecurity surveillance.

It's one of the most serious pests for honey bees worldwide.

Agriculture Minister Dugald Saunders says swift measures are being taken to contain the disease. "We have immediately launched an eradication plan which involved setting up a biosecurity zone, containing the infected hives, and euthanising the bees.

"Australia is the only major honey producing country free from _Varroa_ mite and, if it has the chance to establish here, it could cost the honey industry more than AUD 70 million [about USD 48.5 million] a year," Mr Saunders said.

The Biosecurity Zone covers an area within a 50 kilometre [31 mi] radius of the Port of Newcastle and beekeepers within this zone must not move or tamper with their hives.

Anyone with a hive in the zone must notify the Department of Primary Industries of their location.

[_Varroa_ mites (_Varroa destructor_ and _V. jacobsoni_) are tiny red-brown external parasites of honey bees. Although _Varroa_ mites can feed and live on adult honey bees, they mainly feed and reproduce on larvae and pupae in the developing brood, causing malformation and weakening of honey bees as well as transmitting numerous viruses.

_V. jacobsoni_ is maintained by Asian honey bee (_Apis cerana_), while _V. destructor_ successfully reproduces in both _A. cerana_ and _A. mellifera_ colonies.

"_A. cerana_ is endemic to most of Asia, where it has been used for honey production and pollination services for thousands of years. Since the 1980s, _A. cerana_ has been introduced to areas outside its natural range (including Australia), which sparked fears that it may become a pest species that could compete with, and negatively affect, native Australian fauna and flora, as well as commercially kept _A. mellifera_ and commercial crops."

Being the natural hosts of _V. jacobsoni_ supposes an additional reason to control _A. cerana_ in Australia. It is not clear which _Varroa_ mite is involved in this event. There was a _V. jacobsoni_ incident in Australia in 2019. - Mod.PMB
