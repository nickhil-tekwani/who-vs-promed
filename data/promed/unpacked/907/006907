Marine biologists are trying to figure out why 8 harbor porpoises
have washed ashore near Victoria in the past week. The most recent
carcass was found on the beach near Beacon Hill Park Tuesday [11 May 2010].

It's not unusual for harbor porpoises to wash ashore, but it's
strange to see so many, according to the Department of Fisheries and
Oceans [DFO]. "There's no external trauma, so there's nothing
obvious," said Larry Paike, DFO's manager in Victoria. "The animals
are healthy. They're fat. They've got good musculature. So, it's not
like they're suffering from some debilitating disease."

Paike said the porpoises usually die as a result of being hunted by
killer whales. If they are not actually killed by the whales, the
porpoises die from the stress of being hunted.

The fact that the animal found today [11 May 2010] was pregnant also
could have been a factor. "The onset of the breeding season means a
lot more energy expenditure," marine biologist Anna Hall told CBC
News. "Animals that are not as strong simply don't survive."

Young offspring of all types of marine mammals also are vulnerable in
the wild. The body of a newborn killer whale washed up near Victoria
last week [week of 3 May 2010].

The carcasses of all the dead animals have been sent to a laboratory
in Abbotsford, British Columbia, southeast of Vancouver, for
analysis, said Paike. He said tissue samples will be taken to find
out whether toxins played a role in their deaths.

[We look forward to the results of the necropsies. I wondered if the
deaths of the killer whale calf and porpoises could be related.
Currently there are no reports of domoic acid or any red tide in the area.

Since _Cryptococcus gattii_ has been discovered in a previous
porpoise death, we hope this possibility will be thoroughly examined.
For more information on _C. gattii_ please see ProMED-mail post 20061010.2902.

These are generally creatures that remain in temperate coastal waters
of the Northern hemisphere and are regarded as relatively shy. - Mod.TG]
