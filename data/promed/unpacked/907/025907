Vermont: Probable First Case of West Nile Virus Infection
---------------------------------------------------------
Health officials today announced a probable human case of West Nile virus
infection in Franklin County. If confirmed by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), this will be the first reported human case of
West Nile virus in Vermont. The Franklin County man was admitted and
treated at Northwest Medical Center and has since been discharged.
"We have already confirmed that West Nile virus is Vermont, both birds and
mosquitoes have tested positive, so it was only a matter of time before a
human case was identified" said Dr. Patsy Tassler, Health Department
epidemiologist. West Nile virus is typically spread to humans by the bite
of an infected mosquito. To date, a small number of infected mosquitoes
have been identified in both Franklin and Grand Isle counties.
According to Jon Turmel, state entomologist at the Vermont Department of
Agriculture, the 2 species of mosquitoes that have tested positive in
Vermont to date, _Culex pipiens/restuans_, are known for breeding in small
areas of standing water and artificial containers. People can reduce
breeding areas around their homes. Any puddle or standing water that lasts
for more than 4 days can be a breeding ground for mosquitoes, so people
should empty clogged gutters, change water in bird baths regularly, turn
over any wading pool or wheelbarrow, and get rid of any piles of old tires.

Montana: First Case of West Nile Virus Infection Probably Acquired in Ohio
--------------------------------------------------
The first case of West Nile virus (WNV) in a Montana resident was announced
on Fri 6 Sep 2002 in a 23-year-old Sweet Grass County woman who acquired
the virus while visiting in Ohio, according to State Epidemiologist Todd
Damrow. The woman was reported to be doing fine and was not admitted to a
hospital, he said. She had visited Ohio for several weeks before returning
to Montana and experiencing symptoms associated with the virus, Damrow said.
A serum sample from the patient conducted at the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention tested presumptive positive for West Nile Virus. "It
is standard procedure for states to send their samples to CDC for
confirmation, so that's why we're saying this is a 'presumptive' case,"
Damrow said. "Although this particular case is imported from another state,
we've known for 2 weeks that the virus has been present in horses in
Montana" he added. "It is only a matter of time before a positive human
case is diagnosed that was obtained in Montana." State agencies, including
DPHHS, the departments of Livestock and Fish, Wildlife and Parks (FWP),
have spent much of the past month actively notifying Montana residents of
the disease presence. Educational information about WNV is available at
under the features section.
Because WNV is most serious in horses, veterinarians have worked closely
with livestock owners to make them aware. Likewise, FWP officials are
informing hunters, anglers, and recreationists, and DPHHS has worked with
physicians, hospitals, and county health officials. The departments of
Environmental Quality and Agriculture are also being kept apprised of
developments, as is the state Disaster and Emergency Services Division.
There is no human vaccine for WNV, but there is a vaccine for horses, and
the Department of Livestock has been working with veterinarians for the
past year to make the vaccine available.
The disease spreads when infected mosquitoes feed on birds; the birds then
carry the disease with them to new areas as they migrate and are fed on by
other mosquitoes, which then become infected carriers. A person bitten by
an infected mosquito could show symptoms from 3 to 15 days after the bite.
Symptoms include high fever, headache, stiff neck, muscle weakness or
paralysis, and confusion. Anyone thinking they have WNV symptoms should
contact their physician.
