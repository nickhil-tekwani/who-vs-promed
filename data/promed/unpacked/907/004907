Bird flu hits Dhaka city markets
--------------------------------
Bird flu has hit 6 poultry markets in the capital [Dhaka, Bangladesh]. In the last 15 days, 3 workers from one of the markets came down with the flu; however, they have recovered. The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) and International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR, B) made the detections. The affected markets are among the 16 poultry markets that are under constant surveillance by the 2 research organisations, IEDCR sources say. In the wake of the latest developments, the Department of Livestock Services at a meeting on Wed [7 Mar 2012] decided to form 10 committees to monitor all poultry markets in the capital. The committees will be comprised of livestock officials and personnel from the health ministry, police and Bangladesh Ansar. Musaddique Hossain, a director of livestock services, said they had issued letters to all the stakeholders in poultry trading and processing, asking them to comply with the Animal Disease Act 2008, which prohibits selling sick fowls. Each committee will take steps including checking movement of ill or dead fowls, compelling poultry workers to use gloves and masks and to treat bloods, faeces and feathers properly, he said. Experts say the recent detection of bird flu in market places indicates that more farms affected with the virus are yet to be traced and fowls from these farms are being sold without disclosing the contamination. IEDCR and ICDDR,B sources say the flu might spread to other markets from the affected 6 if precautions are not taken. They have not mentioned the names of the patients or the markets.

This bird flu season, experts say, poultry farmers are not interested to screen their birds seriously, as the government has not compensated the previously affected farms yet. In Bangladesh, the outbreak of the flu, caused by H5N1 virus, begins in November and continues till April. "Due to fund constraints, this bird flu season we are yet to start paying out compensation to the affected farmers. The process will begin soon," said Musaddique Hossain, also the country’s chief veterinary officer. Khaled Saifullah Sohel, secretary of Poultry Farmers’ Association, told this correspondent that this season farm owners are feeling insecure. If they find any sort of avian flu symptoms in their birds, they hurriedly sell them, fearing financial loss.

The situation was quite the opposite last year, he added. The compensation was sufficient and farmers did not conceal any information about flu symptoms. Musaddique said last year they provided Tk 70 for each culled boiler, Tk 150 for each layer, and Tk 250 for a breeder. Of the total compensation, the government was bearing the half and World Bank the rest.

[Since the HPAI H5N1 outbreak in Bangladesh began in 2006, 526 outbreaks in domestic poultry have been reported to the OIE. The disease has not been declared "endemic", hence periodic follow-up reports are continuously submitted -- the last one, No.37, on 15 Jan 2012. All follow-up reports and an interactive showing the accumulated outbreaks can be accessed at http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=5154.

So far, 6 human cases of H5N1 have been recorded in Bangladesh: 1 in 2008, 2 in 2011, and 3 since the beginning of 2012. The recent apparent deterioration in the animal (and, consequently, human) health situation is likely to be related to the problems described regarding compensation to owners of culled poultry. - Mod.AS
