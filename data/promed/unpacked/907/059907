Date event resolved: 29 Jan 2015

This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks: Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Beatrice Hill, Northern Territory
Date of start of the outbreak: 8 Jan 2015
Outbreak status: resolved (29 Jan 2015)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 24 / 6 / 0 / 0 / 0

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 25 / 0 / 0 / 0
* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comment: No disease has been detected. These findings occurred in the known bluetongue zone in northern Australia. 30 years of regular structured surveillance have determined the extent of Australia's bluetongue zone and vectors (http://www.animalhealthaustralia.com.au/programs/disease-surveillance/national-arbovirus-monitoring-program/). Serotypes 1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 15, 16, 20, 21 and 23 have previously been isolated in cattle in Northern Australia. It is believed that infected vectors are periodically blown to Australia on monsoonal winds. The detection of this new serotype is recognition of the effectiveness of the NAMP program. Identification of these isolates as bluetongue virus serotype 5 was established by virus neutralization assays and capillary sequencing of Seg-6(VP5). Sequence analysis of Seg-3 has identified the isolates as belonging to Malaysia A genotype, but in a separate sub-clade to other Malaysia A strains.

Control measures
Measures applied: vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied; no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type:
Australian Animal Health Laboratory (OIE's Reference Laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 26 Mar 2015 / Positive
Cattle / virus neutralization test (VNT) / 22 Apr 2015 / Positive
Cattle / virus sequencing / 22 Apr 2015 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[Bluetongue is an arthropod-borne viral (arboviral) disease of ruminants of variable clinical severity characterised by inflammation of mucous membranes, widespread haemorrhages and oedema (Note: see epidemiological comment). Ten of the 26 internationally recognised serotypes of bluetongue virus (BTV) and several related viruses in the _Orbivirus_ genus have been recorded in northern Australia, although some of these serotypes are detected infrequently http://www.animalhealthaustralia.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/BTV3.2-13-FINAL8Jul13.pdf.

This is the 1st time that BTV-5 has been reported in Australia.
