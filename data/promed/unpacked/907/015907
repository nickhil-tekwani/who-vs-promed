- The country continues to be affected by 2 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks: the 1st centered in Jigawa state with subsequent spread to other states as well as to neighbouring Republic of Niger, and the 2nd in Sokoto state.
- Recent confirmation of spread of 1 of the cVDPV2 outbreaks, both within Nigeria and internationally, underscores the urgent need to fill remaining vaccination gaps in the ongoing outbreak response, and to optimize the geographic extent and operational quality of multivalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) response.
- At the same time, outbreak response to WPV1 continues, including efforts to address surveillance and immunity gaps in parts of Borno state.

Lake Chad basin
- No case of cVDPV2 has been reported in the past week. The most recent cVDPV2 isolated in the country was in Magaria district, Zinder province, with an onset of paralysis on [5 Dec 2018].
- The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 reported in Niger in 2018 is 10. The outbreak is genetically linked to the cVDPV2 outbreak originating in Jigawa, Nigeria. Virus was isolated from children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) from Zinder region, located in the south of Niger and on the border with Nigeria, with dates of onset of paralysis ranging from [18 Jul 2019 through 5 Dec 2018].
- AFP surveillance and routine immunization across the country with focus on the infected provinces and the provinces at the international borders with Nigeria are being reinforced.
- Active case-finding for additional AFP cases is continuing, and additional surveillance measures, such as increasing the frequency and extent of environmental surveillance and community sampling of healthy individuals, is being expanded.

Central Africa
- No cases of cVDPV2 were reported this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported in 2018 is 20.
- The most recent cVDPV2 AFP case was reported from Mufunga-Sampwe district in Haut-Katanga province with onset of paralysis on [7 Oct 2018].
- DRC is affected by 4 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, in the provinces of Haut Katanga; Mongala; Maniema; and Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri.

Horn of Africa
- No cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week.
- The Horn of Africa is currently affected by separate outbreaks of cVDPV2 and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3), reporting both AFP cases and environmental-positive samples.
- Somalia has reported a total of 12 cVDPV cases (5 type 2, 6 type 3, and 1 coinfection of both type 2 and type 3) in 2018.
- The most recent cVDPV2 virus was isolated from an environmental sample collected on [11 Oct 2018] from Waberi district in Banadir province. The most recent cVDPV3 virus was isolated from an environmental sample, also from Waberi district, Banadir province, collected on [23 Aug 2018].
- cVDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in 1 environmental sample in Kenya collected on [21 Mar 2018].
- Outbreak response to both virus types is currently being implemented in line with internationally agreed guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle, and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia. Special surveillance activities continue to be undertaken to determine the origin of the viral circulation.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Papua New Guinea
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 remains 26.
- The most recent cVDPV1 virus was isolated from an environmental sample collected in the National Capital district on [6 Nov 2018].
- Emergency operation centres are established and operational at the national level and in all affected provinces; environmental surveillance is functional in 5 sites in 2 major cities.
- 3 SIAs of expanding scope have taken place since late July [2018], from 3 provinces to 9, to nationwide. The most recent was aimed at children under the age of 15 due to large numbers of poorly immunized older children.
- Planning is under way for the next steps of the outbreak response, focusing on both vaccination and surveillance for polioviruses.
- Detection and reporting of new viruses or cases at this point in the outbreak response is not unusual or unexpected, as surveillance is being strengthened and most reported and confirmed cases had onset of paralysis prior to the start of comprehensive outbreak response.

Mozambique
- No case of cVDPV2 outbreak has been reported this week.
- 1 cVDPV2-positive sample has been collected from a community contact (of the cVDPV2 case) from Molumbo district, Zambezia province, on [17 Dec 2018].
- 2 genetically linked cVDPV2 isolates were detected: from an AFP case (with onset of paralysis on [21 Oct 2018], in a 6 year old girl with no history of vaccination, from Molumbo district, Zambezia province), and one isolated from a community contact of the case reported on [10 Dec 2018].
- The Global Polio Eradication Initiative [GPEI] and partners are working with country counterparts to support the local public health authorities in conducting a field investigation (clinical, epidemiological, and immunological) and thorough risk assessment to discuss planning and implementation of immunization and outbreak response.
- In January 2017, a single VDPV2 virus had been isolated from a 5 year old boy with AFP, also from Zambezia province (Mopeia district). Outbreak response was conducted in the 1st half of 2017 with mOPV2.

Indonesia
- No cVDPV1 cases were reported this week.
- 2 genetically linked cVDPV1 isolates were detected: from an AFP case, with onset of paralysis on [27 Nov 2018], and from a sample of a healthy community contact, in Papua province, collected on [24 Jan 2019]. This outbreak is not linked to the cVDPV1 currently affecting neighbouring Papua New Guinea.
- The GPEI and partners are working with country counterparts to support the local public health authorities in conducting a field investigation (clinical, epidemiological, and immunological) and thorough risk assessment to discuss planning and implementation of immunization and outbreak response.

[2] 20th IHR Emergency Committee statement
Date: Fri 1 Mar 2019

Statement of the 20th IHR Emergency Committee regarding the international spread of poliovirus
-----------------------------------------------------------
The 20th meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) regarding the international spread of poliovirus was convened by the director general on [19 Feb 2019] at WHO headquarters with members, advisers, and invited member states attending via teleconference, supported by the WHO secretariat.

The Emergency Committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV). The secretariat presented a report of progress for affected IHR states parties subject to Temporary Recommendations. The following IHR states parties provided an update on the current situation and the implementation of the WHO Temporary Recommendations since the committee last met on [27 Nov 2018]: Afghanistan, Indonesia, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Papua New Guinea (PNG).

The committee commended all countries that presented on the quality of information provided and the attention by the health authorities to ensuring timely and adequate responses in the field.

Wild poliovirus
Worldwide there are 3 remaining endemic countries, with Afghanistan and Pakistan being the only 2 countries where wild poliovirus transmission is continuing to be reported. The committee noted the continued high degree of cooperation and coordination between Afghanistan and Pakistan, particularly in reaching high-risk mobile populations that frequently cross the international border. The committee noted that it is more than 4 years since there has been international spread outside of these 2 epidemiologically linked countries.

However, the committee was very concerned by the increase in WPV1 cases globally in 2018, with more cases in the 2 countries than in 2017. This trend appears to be continuing in 2019, with 6 cases already compared to 2 for the same period in 2018. Furthermore, international spread between the 2 countries has continued, after an earlier 10-month period of no international spread between the 2 neighbors. The committee welcomed that expansion of the target age group for vaccination at the international land border was being implemented on a trial basis in Afghanistan.

In Pakistan, transmission continues to be widespread, as indicated by the number of positive environmental isolates in many areas of the country. The recent case in Lahore also indicated that vulnerabilities still exist outside the high-risk corridors.

In Afghanistan, the worsened security and accessibility since early 2018 continues, and there are persistent pockets of refusals and missed children. Environmental surveillance is also finding an increased proportion of positive samples. The security situation and access would need to significantly improve for eradication efforts to progress. The recent visit of the director general of WHO to both countries, meeting with their heads of state, was a very positive step.

It is now more than 2 years since the last WPV1 was detected in Nigeria, and 4 years since there has been any international spread of WPV1 from the country. The committee commended the strong efforts to reach inaccessible and trapped children in Borno, Nigeria, even in the face of increased insecurity, and noted that the inaccessible target population was now down to around 70 000 children, scattered across Borno state in smaller pockets.

Vaccine-derived poliovirus
There are now 8 countries in 4 WHO regions responding to outbreaks of cVDPV, an unprecedented number of outbreaks in recent years. The new outbreak of cVDPV1 in Indonesia exemplifies the gaps in population immunity in many parts of the world considered polio-free. It appears likely that there has been missed transmission of this virus for several years, although there is no evidence so far that this has occurred outside of Papua province. However, surveillance within Indonesia urgently needs to improve, not just in Papua and West Papua provinces. PNG continues to mount a very effective response, and the committee noted that both Indonesia and PNG had been proactive in ensuring effective coordination on both sides of the border.

The new outbreak of cVDPV2 in Mozambique is a serious concern, as it may be linked to inadequate controls placed upon unused vials of mOPV2 during the earlier event there in 2017. The committee noted that the case occurred close to the border with Malawi, prompting concern about the opportunity for international spread.

The cVDPV2 outbreaks in Nigeria highlight the vulnerability to poliovirus infection in many parts of the country, with the virus spreading to areas not previously considered at high risk of polio, such as Kwara. Although no international spread of WPV1 has been observed from Nigeria since 2014, the recent cases of importation of cVDPV2 into Niger is concerning, given that cVDPVs have rarely spread across borders in the past. The committee was concerned by the lack of progress in controlling this outbreak and the proximity of a recent case to the Republic of Benin. The committee noted the delays between case investigation and final laboratory results and suggested an analysis be undertaken to understand the reasons for this.

Repeated importations from Nigeria into Niger indicates that while strong efforts had been made to respond to risks posed by high-risk populations, such as cattle herders and other nomads, IDPs, and refugees, more needs to be done to prevent future international spread between Nigeria and Niger. Surveillance gaps in nearby vulnerable countries in the Lake Chad area raises concerns about missed transmission in these countries.

The outbreak of cVDPV2 in Somalia and Kenya is another infrequent example of international spread of cVDPV across borders. The absence of transmission in recent months in Somalia and Kenya was welcomed; however, large inaccessible areas of Somalia are a significant constraint on achieving interruption of transmission, exacerbated by large population movements escaping conflict or driven by economic and security factors. Countries neighboring Somalia, such as South Sudan, Ethiopia, and Djibouti, have areas of weak surveillance, which poses a risk that international spread may go undetected.

Although there are indications that transmission may be slowing in DRC, the protracted duration of the outbreak, ongoing conflict, insecurity, and population movements within and outside the country represent a significant risk of spread.

The committee noted that in all infected countries, routine immunization was weak, and coverage remains very poor in many areas of these countries.

Inaccessibility is a major risk to interruption of transmission in Nigeria, Niger, Somalia, and Afghanistan.

Conclusion
The committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further 3 months. The committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion:

- Rising number of WPV1 cases: Although the declaration of the PHEIC and issuance of Temporary Recommendations has reduced the risk of international spread of WPV, progress is fragile, and should international spread now occur, the impact on WPV eradication would be even more grave in terms of delaying certification and prolonging requirements for dedicated human and financial resources in support of the eradication effort. The increasing cases in Afghanistan and Pakistan, with associated cross-border spread of WPV1 continuing between the 2 countries as well as the widespread geographic detection through environmental sampling of the virus in Pakistan, heighten concerns, especially as cases have increased during the current low season.

- Complacency: There is a risk of global complacency, as the numbers of WPV cases remains low and eradication becomes a tangible reality, and a concern that removal of the PHEIC now could contribute to greater complacency.

- Rising number of cVDPV outbreaks: Many countries remain vulnerable to WPV importation. Gaps in population immunity in several key high-risk areas is evidenced by the current number of cVDPV outbreaks of all serotypes, which only emerge and circulate when polio population immunity is low as a result of deficient routine immunization programs. Currently, 4 WHO regions are managing polio outbreaks.

- International spread of cVDPV: The international spread of cVDPV2 affecting Somalia and Kenya, and Nigeria and Niger, are other examples of the current heightened risk of international spread of polioviruses. Waning population immunity to type 2 polioviruses in the face of the limited IPV supply and weak routine immunization in many countries means that significant numbers of countries neighboring these outbreaks may be at high risk of importation of cVDPV2.

- Weak routine immunization: Many countries have weak immunization systems that can be further impacted by various humanitarian emergencies, and the number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies poses a growing risk, leaving populations in these fragile states vulnerable to outbreaks of polio.

- Surveillance gaps: The appearance of highly diverged VDPVs in Somalia and Indonesia are examples of inadequate polio surveillance, heightening concerns that transmission could be missed in various countries. Similar gaps exist in Lake Chad countries and around the Horn of Africa.

- Protracted outbreaks: The difficulty in rapidly controlling VDPV outbreaks in Nigeria and DR Congo was another risk.

- Lack of access: Inaccessibility continues to be a major risk, particularly in several countries currently infected with WPV or cVDPV, that is, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Niger, and Somalia, which all have sizable populations that have been unreached with polio vaccine for prolonged periods.

- Population movement: The risk is amplified by population movement, whether for family, social, economic, or cultural reasons, or in the context of populations displaced by insecurity and returning refugees. There is a need for international coordination to address these risks. A regional approach and strong cross­border cooperation is required to respond to these risks, as much international spread of polio occurs over land borders.

Risk categories
The committee provided the director-general with the following advice aimed at reducing the risk of international spread of WPV1 and cVDPVs, based on the risk stratification as follows:
- states infected with WPV1, cVDPV1, or cVDPV3, with potential risk of international spread;
- states infected with cVDPV2, with potential risk of international spread;
- states no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV, but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV.

Criteria to assess states as no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV: [available at source URL]

These countries should: [see source URL]

Additional considerations
The world is at a critical point in polio eradication. Failure to boost population immunity through strengthening routine immunization, and failure to prevent outbreaks through implementation of high quality SIAs in areas of known high risk, could jeopardize or severely delay polio eradication. The current situation calls for unabated efforts and use of every tool available, to achieve the goal in these most challenging countries. Particularly in the 3 remaining endemic countries, further engagement with senior levels of government and other key stakeholders is needed to advocate for polio eradication and ensure all levels of government maintain a strong commitment until the job is done.

Noting the spread of polioviruses in several areas close to international borders, the committee strongly urges that surveillance, population immunity assessments, and outbreak preparedness activities intensify in all neighboring countries, particularly in Benin, Malawi, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Djibouti, Lake Chad basin countries, and the Central African Republic. There needs to be a renewed urgency to addressing these gaps wherever they exist.

Countries using mOPV2 should take great care in accounting for all vials of the vaccine to avoid unauthorized and inappropriate use outside a globally agreed SIA campaign.

Based on the current situation regarding WPV1 and cVDPV, and the reports provided by Afghanistan, Indonesia, Mozambique, Nigeria, Niger, Pakistan, and Papua New Guinea, the director-general accepted the committee's assessment and, on [28 Feb 2019], determined that the situation relating to poliovirus continues to constitute a PHEIC, with respect to WPV1 and cVDPV. The director-general endorsed the committee's recommendations for countries meeting the definition for "states infected with WPV1, cVDPV1, or cVDPV3 with potential risk for international spread," "states infected with cVDPV2 with potential risk for international spread," and "states no longer infected by WPV1 or cVDPV but which remain vulnerable to re-infection by WPV or cVDPV" and extended the Temporary Recommendations under the IHR to reduce the risk of the international spread of poliovirus, effective [28 Feb 2019].

[I highly recommend reading the Statement of the 20th IHR Emergency Committee, as it clearly delineates the challenges facing the global polio eradication initiative, further highlighted by this week's global polio summary. While there are no newly confirmed cases of paralytic polio associated with WPVs or with cVDPVs, there is documentation of continued transmission of both WPVs and cVDPVs as seen in positive environmental samples and in healthy contacts of previously confirmed cases.
