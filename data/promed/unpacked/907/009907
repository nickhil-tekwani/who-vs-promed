Romania discovered an outbreak of the deadly H5N1 avian flu virus in
the Danube river delta at a small farm on Wednesday [28 Nov 2007],
officials said.

The head of the National Sanitary Veterinary Agency (ANSV), Radu
Roatis, said tests taken on samples from the dead birds revealed the
presence of the H5N1 virus.

"The suspicion for H5N1 was confirmed by the national laboratory. We
discovered the virus in hens and ducks," Roatis told Reuters.

[Interestingly, the Tulcae region, the site of the current outbreak,
is within the Danube delta. This is the very same area where a big
epizootic of H5N1 took place in October-November 2005, involving wild
birds, predominantly swans, as well as domestic fowl. For the exact
location of Murighiol, see map at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/RO/0/Murighiol.html>.

Romania became, in October 2005, the 1st country in mainland Europe
to detect the H5N1 virus in poultry, namely in the Danube delta,
Europe's largest wetlands near the Black Sea and a major flyway of
migratory birds.

It may be assumed that the described outbreak is related to contacts
with migratory or wild birds. - Mod.AS]

Saudi Arabia's agriculture ministry on Wednesday [28 Nov 2007] said 2
new cases of avian influenza were detected at separate egg production
facilities in the capital Riyadh.

The Saudi Press Agency quoted the ministry as saying that the H5N1
outbreaks occurred at the Thadiq and Kharj governorates.

The agriculture ministry, together with the interior ministry,
hospitals and local governments in the affected region, killed all
birds at the 2 sites. The facilities were also cleaned before these
were closed down.

The ministry ordered poultry breeders and producers from the 2
facilities to take measures to prevent the spread of the disease by
making sure that migrating birds don't enter sheds, storage of fodder
or drinking and cooling water.

Owners of poultry farms and residents are urged to report suspicious
cases through a toll-free hotline or to the nearest branch of the
agriculture ministry.

Some 50 000 birds were also culled from the same areas early this
month [November 2007] due to similar bird flu outbreaks.

[The severe measures applied by the Saudi authorities to control the
H5N1 outbreaks, cull the affected holdings and prevent further events
are dictated by the timetable of the upcoming mass-celebrations, when
millions of worshippers are expected in the kingdom. The annual Hajj
is due to begin 18 Dec 2007; the Eid Al-Adha festival begins on 20
Dec 2007.

Food safety and, in view of its relatedness, also feed safety are
issues which deserve the highest attention during the huge mass
gathering. A reply to recent repeated Requests for Information on
undiagnosed mass mortality of camels in the kingdom, with potential
public health implications, is yet to be obtained (see references). -
