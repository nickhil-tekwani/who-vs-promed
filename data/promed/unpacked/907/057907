https://www.wagmtv.com/content/news/Maine-CDC-reports-six-known-cases--of-Hepatitis-A-since-May-511477552.html


The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Maine CDC) has identified 3 additional cases of hepatitis A virus infection in Aroostook County over the past week. There are now 6 confirmed hepatitis A cases in Aroostook County since 17 May 2019. All 6 cases are linked to exposures at a restaurant in Caribou earlier this spring. There is no ongoing risk of hepatitis A to the public from eating at this restaurant.

Maine CDC Public Health Nurses assisted local medical facilities to administer hepatitis A vaccine over the past 3 days, and the Maine CDC Immunization Program provided hepatitis A vaccine to Aroostook County health care facilities. Close contacts of affected individuals have been notified. However, symptoms of hepatitis A can take weeks to develop. Health care providers are encouraged to remain vigilant for hepatitis A infection.

Officials with the CDC say the best way to prevent hepatitis A infection is to get vaccinated. Other preventive measures include practicing good hand hygiene - thoroughly washing hands after using the bathroom, changing diapers, and before preparing or eating food. Officials also recommend that all food service workers get vaccinated for hepatitis A.

This disease usually spreads when a person ingests the virus from contaminated objects, food, or drinks. It can also spread from close contact with an infected person such as caring for someone who is ill.

Hepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable, contagious liver disease caused by a virus. Symptoms range from mild illness to a severe sickness that requires hospitalization and can last several months. Most adults with hepatitis A have a sudden onset of symptoms such as tiredness, low appetite, stomach pain, nausea, dark urine, and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes). Most children younger than 6 years of age do not have symptoms or have an unrecognized infection. If you develop symptoms of hepatitis A, contact your healthcare provider.

[Although the details of transmission are not clear, these cases all appear to be related to eating at a restaurant. The posting states that there is no risk for eating at the restaurant currently. There is always a risk, however, from the food either contaminated at the establishment or earlier in the food chain. On any given day, a Google search can find posts on food handlers in restaurants being diagnosed with hepatitis A. While much of the ongoing epidemic of HAV is occurring in marginalized individuals who are homeless and/or substance abusers, spill over into food handlers is occurring which puts the dining public at risk. One way to minimize this risk is requiring HAV vaccinations for food handlers, period. - Mod.LL]

A hepatitis A outbreak in Florida continued to expand last week, with 99 new cases reported, according to information on the state Department of Health website. That brought the total number of cases in 2019 to 1561, up from 548 cases in 2018, 276 cases in 2017 and 122 cases in 2016. The disease, which can cause liver damage, can be spread through such things as food or drinks that have been contaminated with fecal matter from people with the disease.

Health officials have urged Floridians to get vaccinated against the disease. Pasco County has had the most cases in 2019, with 299. It is followed by Pinellas County, with 281 cases; Orange County, with 122 cases; Volusia County, with 114 cases; Hillsborough County, with 103 cases; and Marion County, with 91 cases, the Department of Health numbers show.

A jump in acute hepatitis A cases in Clark County this year [2019] has prompted local health officials to declare an outbreak. There have been more reported hepatitis A cases from [1 Jan 2019] through [31 May 2019] than during that same period for the last 3 years combined, the Southern Nevada Health District announced [Wed 19 Jun 2019]. During the first 5 months of 2019, there were 37 reported cases, topping the 17 in 2018, zero in 2017 and 6 in 2016 in that same period.

Vaccination is the best defense against hepatitis A, but good hygiene habits like hand washing also decrease risk of infection, the district said in a release.

"This current outbreak of hepatitis A in our community is an unfortunate but important reminder of why vaccines are vital to both our individual and community health," said Dr. Joe Iser, chief health officer for the district. About 86% of the patients so far in 2019 used drugs and 65% of them were considered homeless, the release said.

Those who may be at risk for a hepatitis infection include people with chronic liver disease, men who have sex with men, people who travel to or work in countries where the infection is common, people with direct contact with infected people and those with clotting-factor disorders, the release said.

[Neither Maine nor Nevada have yet made the CDC list of state outbreaks of HAV: https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/outbreaks/2017March-HepatitisA.htm.

As the numbers of cases continue to rise in a number of states, and news of smaller (so far) outbreaks occur in others, the question at the end of ProMED post 20190104.6241686 by a Kentucky official, "This is a disease of developing countries. One has to ask: Why are we seeing it in the USA?" is more and more relevant. We are seeing these outbreaks because of the inability to deal with marginalized populations among our midst. The dramatic cutbacks in public health infrastructure in some of these states clearly feed the fire of these outbreaks. They must be addressed by bolstering public health resources and education, and directly addressing the needs of these marginalized populations. - Mod.LL
