Cholera in United Republic of Tanzania
Another peak number of cholera cases has been reported from Dar es Salaam,
Kinondoni district, in May due to the breakdown of the main water pipe in
this district. In one week, more than 1,000 cases occurred. Tanzania, where
cholera is endemic, has been suffering from a major cholera outbreak since
last year. In 1997, a total number of 40,249 cases and 2,231 deaths were
officially reported to WHO. This year, up to 7 June, already 11,512 cases
and 321 deaths have been registered. The support from several donors, as
well as the collaboration of WHO, other UN agencies and NGOs with the
Government of Tanzania has contributed to a decrease in case fatality rates.
