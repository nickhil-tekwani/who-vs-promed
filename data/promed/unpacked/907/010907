of the area. The owner had been informed that all the 2414 pigs in the farm
would be culled immediately. "All areas and roads around the area are now
guarded by police and the public is not allowed to bring any livestock or

Penang has been put on red alert as the deadly Nipah virus has been
detected at a farm with 2,414 pigs in Kampung Luar Valdor in Sungai Bakap,
Seberang Prai Selatan.
Chief Minister Tan Sri Dr Koh Tsu Koon said results of the test came
through the Veterinary Research Institute in Ipoh at 9.30am yesterday. He
said blood samples from the pigs were taken on May 4 and the tests were
ready on Tuesday "but the authorities had to wait and double check" before
ordering a quarantine at 2:30 PM yesterday.
"I have ordered an immediate quarantine on that farm, the people there will
be evacuated and all the pigs on the farm will be culled as soon as
possible," he told a press conference before the afternoon session of the
state assembly sitting yesterday. Dr Koh said the farmer and his family
would be evacuated to a centre that had yet to be decided on.
He said the state task force which had been re-activated would be mobilised
to facilitate all culling and evacuation arrangement to curb the spread of
the disease to 49 other farms in Valdor New Village.
Dr Koh said the 49 pig farms in Kampung Valdor had 56,724 pigs. A second
blood test would be carried out immediately on them too.
"The whole area has also been placed under quarantine, which means that no
movement of all animals is allowed in and out of the area from 2.30pm
today," he said.
