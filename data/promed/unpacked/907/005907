European public health agencies evaluate antibiotic resistance of
_Staphylococcus aureus_
----------------------------------------
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the European Centre for
Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) and the European Medicines
Agency (EMEA) have published today [16 Jun 2009] a joint Scientific
Report on meticillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) in
livestock, pets and foods.

Following a request from the European Commission, EFSA's Panel on
Biological Hazards and ECDC concluded that food-producing animals
such as pigs, veal calves and broiler chickens often carry without
symptoms a specific strain of MRSA called CC398. However, while food
may be contaminated by MRSA, there is currently no evidence that
eating or handling contaminated food can lead to an increased health
risk for humans. The report also noted that people in contact with
live animals that carry the CC398 strain of MRSA could be at risk of
infection. This specific strain of MRSA has been associated, albeit
rarely, with serious skin and soft tissue infections, pneumonia and
blood poisoning in humans. Pet animals can also be infected with
MRSA, where the bacteria 1st pass from humans to pets and then back
to humans. The document noted the importance of basic hygiene
measures, especially hand washing before and after contact with
animals, and, if possible, avoiding direct contact with nasal
secretions, saliva and wounds.

The report concluded that as animal movement and contact between live
animals and humans are likely to be important factors in the
transmission of MRSA, the most effective control measures will be at
farm level.

In a parallel review, the European Medicines Agency looked at the
risk of colonisation or infection of livestock and companion animals
with MRSA in the context of the authorisation and the use of
antimicrobial veterinary medicines. The Committee for Medicinal
Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) found that MRSA is resistant to
virtually all antibiotics from the beta-lactam group, and very often
also to other antimicrobials. Prudent use of antimicrobials in
animals should remain a key measure, and the CVMP recommended
monitoring of animal consumption of antimicrobials to identify any
sources of unnecessary use. The Committee also recommended that
medicines of last resort for MRSA treatment in humans should be
avoided in animals so as to ensure their continued efficacy in humans.

MRSA infections are widespread in hospitals in many EU Member States
and are a major cause of hospital-acquired infections which can lead
to severe illness and in some cases fatalities. In recent years, a
link has also been established between MRSA in animals and human MRSA
infections. In the areas of the EU where MRSA is found amongst food
producing animals, people in contact with these animals, such as
farmers, veterinarians and their families, are at risk of acquiring
an MRSA infection. Given the severity of some MRSA infection, ECDC is
supportive of measures to ensure prudent use of antibiotics in food
producing animals. Through the European Antibiotic Awareness Day
initiative, ECDC is actively engaged in initiatives to raise
awareness about the risks associated with inappropriate use of
antibiotics and how to use antibiotics responsibly.

[Certainly the vast majority of human MRSA infections, both
healthcare-associated and in the community, are related to
human-to-human transmission, but the role of animals remains of
interest and may be important in situations where there is extensive
human-animal contact. - Mod.LM]
