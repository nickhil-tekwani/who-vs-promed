[Although not stated in the above report, it can be presumed that this
fatal case of rabies in the Batken region of Kyrgyzstan was contracted by
dog-bite, as was the death reported in July in the Osh region. Canine
rabies appears to be enzootic in Kyrgyzstan. In the longer term, a
comprehensive canine vaccination program will be required to adequately
protect the human population. - Mod.CP]
