SALMONELLA TYPHIMURIUM DT104 - DENMARK (02)
===========================================
[see
Salmonella typhimurium DT104 - Denmark 970502151617
Date: Sat, 3 May 1997 14:05:49 +0100

>
>We are interested to know whether specific efforts to control DT104 have
been made in other countries and whether they have been succesful. What
measures were taken in herds to eliminate the bacterium?
>
On a practical note how would a farmer in Denmark, or anywhere else, be able
to identify that he might have these organisms on his farm? Is the disease
typically obvious, with animals getting sick enough that a typing would be
requested by the vet, or are we talking about a latent infection at low
levels with a few excretors and the rest of the herd immune and showing no
effect?
Although 'herds' were quoted, are we in fact talking about cattle, or
pigs/poultry?
