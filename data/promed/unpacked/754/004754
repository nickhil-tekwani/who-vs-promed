[1] Dominica: 1st case

Officials of the [Dominica] Ministry of Health revealed today [16 Jan 2014] that those blood sucking mosquitoes, especially _Aedes aegypti_, are responsible for Dominica's 1st case of chikungunya fever. "We can confirm now as we speak ... that we have the 1st locally occurring case of chikungunya [virus infection] in Dominica," said Dr David Johnson, Dominica's chief medical officer at a press conference this afternoon. "It's a female with a travel history from St Marten."

Chikungunya [fever] is a viral illness that resembles dengue fever and it is spread by the bite of infected mosquitoes. The fever is characterized by severe, sometimes persistent, joint pain (arthritis), as well as fever and rash. The main difference between dengue and chikungunya [virus infections] is joint pain.

Chikungunya virus was 1st isolated from the blood of a febrile patient in Tanzania in 1953. Since then it has caused several human epidemics in many areas of Africa and Asia and most recently in limited areas of Europe. At the moment it has been discovered in the French Islands and in St Marten, among other countries of the Caribbean. However, it is not a life threatening disease. But the widespread occurrence of the fever causes substantial morbidity and economic loss.

"Most cases of chikungunya [virus infection] are going to be mild and the patient will recover without any major problems," Dr Paul Ricketts, Dominica's epidemiologist. "However, occasionally some patients can have a chronic form of the disease which involves continuing joint pains and listlessness that can go on for several months."

Since the person infected with chikungunya virus lives in Good Hope, the Environment Health Department has mounted a campaign against the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito there, starting with fogging in the village tonight [16 Jan 2014] and on-going house inspection to destroy the breeding places of the mosquito.

Chief environmental health officer, Joseph Scotland, said another mosquito species named _Aedes albopictus_ is found to be a carrier of the disease, but that mosquito has not been found in Dominica.

Symptoms of chikungunya virus infection [include] fever, headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, muscle pain, rash and joint pain. The best precaution for chikungunya [virus infection] is the prevention of mosquito bites by using insect repellent and the wearing of long sleeves and pants. Preventative measures also include getting rid of mosquito sources in and around the house by emptying standing water from flower pots, buckets and barrels.

Though Ministry of Health officials are concerned about the possible spread, Dr Johnson said at the moment there is no need for persons to panic or to be scared. "There is no need for any alarm at this time," he said. "The person who was affected with the chikungunya disease has recovered and is at home doing well. We want to establish whether there are any cases of chikungunya [virus infections] in Dominica or whether the infected case has been transmitting the disease in Dominica."

[This is a case where the infection was acquired on St Martin. So far, there have been no locally acquired chikungunya virus infections detected on Dominica yet. However, it does illustrate how the virus can more around easily, and does not bode well for the virus being contained on the islands where cases have been confirmed so far.

In an additional report published in the 17 Jan 2014 issue of the Jamaica Observer, Trinidad-based Caribbean Public Health Agency executive director, Dr James Hospedales, told the Caribbean Media Corporation (CMC), "the Caribbean is at risk; exactly what will happen in the weeks and months ahead we don't know because it has not been here before, but we are at risk" (http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/latestnews/Dominica-records-first-case-of-chikungunya).

[2] Caribbean: economic concerns

The 1st known outbreak of the chikungunya virus in the western hemisphere has Caribbean governments working to prevent the disease from spreading and damaging the region's tourism-dependent economies.

About 280 cases of chikungunya [virus infection; many more cases than this, see the report below - Mod.TY], which can cause severe joint pain, fever and headaches, have been reported since early December [2013] in Dutch and French St Martin, Saint Barthelemy, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Dominica, the British Virgin Islands, and French Guiana. Officials from Venezuela to the Cayman Islands have warned of the potential for the mosquitoborne virus, 1st identified from a patient in Tanzania in 1953, to spread. There is no treatment, and the illness is rarely fatal.

"The worst case scenario would be that the impact would be significant and slow down the whole economy in the Caribbean," James Hospedales, the executive director of the Caribbean Public Health Agency, said by telephone. "The Caribbean is the most tourism-dependent region in the world, so if it spreads like wildfire you could scare away tourists."

[This report is a good illustration of potential adverse economic effects when a new disease appears in a major tourist destination. Although dengue fever poses greater health risks, the addition of a 2nd virus disease to the area increases concern on the part of the traveling public. - Mod.TY]
