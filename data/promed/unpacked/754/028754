Indonesia is preparing an early bird flu warning system that will
reach even the most remote areas to speed up reporting of any
outbreaks, but a U.N. agency said the scheme needs more than goodwill.
The "village preparedness policy" involves local governments setting
up health posts in all villages, where personnel including doctors
would be alert to flu cases in birds and humans, particularly in
infected areas.
"It is like an early warning system to achieve integrated
communication in order to speed up action," said Syamsul Bahri,
director of animal health at the agriculture ministry.
Indonesia, with 220 million people, has many millions of chickens and
ducks, the majority in the backyards of rural or urban homes. Such a
close relationship between people and livestock has helped spread the
disease in humans, and to date 12 Indonesians have been confirmed
infected with the H5N1 avian flu virus with 7 deaths.
The virus is endemic in poultry in Indonesia and has now been
reported in 2/3 of the nation's 33 provinces. Health officials say
better surveillance is crucial to stop the virus infecting any more people.
But putting in place an extensive, test-responding, monitoring system
has been a huge challenge for the cash-strapped government as well as
U.N. agencies such as the Food and Agriculture Organisation, which
have been calling for more foreign aid.
The FAO welcomed the plan but said it required a national strategy
and called on local officials not to cover up bird flu outbreaks.
"I hope we could build that into one unified system. What I'm
interested in is whether that should be sustained into the next
financial year," Peter Roeder, an animal health officer heading an
emergency team from the FAO, told Reuters.
He said it was important that district leaders be aware of their
responsibility and obligations and used their resources to make sure
they [were] part of the reporting system. "Don't try to cover up the
presence of the disease but actively cooperate with authorities to
control the disease," he added.
Roeder's comments came amid local reports which quoted some residents
as saying that health officials ignore reports from the public of
suspected bird flu cases since the national campaign to eradicate the
disease was launched by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in
September. Yudhoyono has warned local administrations to make it a
top priority and not to cover up bird flu outbreaks to please him.
The FAO says it has launched its own grass-roots scheme covering Java
island since November 2005. "[They are] very similar activities, and
I hope we could build that into one unified system. I'm sure we can,
but we haven't discussed this before with the minister," said Roeder
referring to Agriculture Minister Anton Apriyantono.

[Indonesia, a country experiencing human cases, has not reported
cases in avians to the OIE since 27 Jun 2005.

the start of the panzootic in Dec 2003, are shown in a graph on OIE

Officials in Ukraine, [a country] so far free of bird flu, have sent
experts to investigate the sudden deaths of more than 1500 birds in
the Crimean peninsula, the Agriculture Minister said on Friday.
Oleksander Baranivsky, speaking to 1+1 television, said the birds
were found in a half dozen villages in the peninsula jutting into the
Black Sea. He gave no details on the type of birds or other information.
"At the moment we have 1621 dead birds. Tonight, the situation will
become more clear," Baranivsky told the station by telephone.
"Measures are being taken. Experts have been sent there. If cases of
any specific virus are found, further measures will be introduced."
The channel said the sale of privately raised domestic poultry had
been banned in Crimea.
Romania on Friday discovered new cases of bird flu in the Danube
Delta it shares with Ukraine and samples were being sent to a British
laboratory to determine whether the infected birds had the highly
pathogenic H5N1 strain.
Romania became the 1st country in mainland Europe to detect the H5N1
virus in 2 villages in the delta. Bird flu has also been found in
several regions of Russia, Ukraine's northern neighbor.
Ukrainian officials have performed analyses on thousands of domestic
and wild birds but detected no cases of bird flu. All hunting of
birds has been halted, and residents have been told to keep their
stocks indoors to prevent contact with wild birds.
