With a dengue fever epidemic declared in February 2008 and still
uncontrolled, New Caledonia now has to combat water and
humidity-related diseases on another front, namely leptospirosis.

The dengue epidemic that has been affecting the capital Noumea and
its suburbs but also the northeastern island of Lifou (Loyalty island
group) is now affecting over 320 persons, latest counts revealed.

Late last week, health authorities said they were now on high alert
for another water-related disease, leptospirosis, with up to 50 known
cases to date. A fresh warning has been issued for the general public
to be particularly cautious and not walk barefoot, since the diseases
spreads through contact with muddy and inundated soils that could
have been infected by animals such as pigs or rats. The main source
of infection for leptospirosis is animal waste in still waters.

Local health authorities have also warned that early symptoms for
leptospirosis, just like dengue, could be easily mistaken for those
of a severe flu (fever, joint and back pains). In all cases, they
recommended that an individual should seek medical advice.

[It would not be surprisingly that an outbreak of a water-borne
disease such as leptospirosis would occur associated with a
mosquito-borne disease such as dengue, as mosquito populations
increase with increasing amounts of standing water.

New Caledonia
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Caledonia>
is a "sui generis collectivity" (in practice, an overseas territory)
of France made up of a main island (Grande Terre), the Loyalty
Islands, and several smaller islands. It is located in the region of
Melanesia in the southwest Pacific and can be found on a map at:
