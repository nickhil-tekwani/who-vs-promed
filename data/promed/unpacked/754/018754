British precautions for preventing the spread of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease (vCJD) through beef contaminated with Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy (BSE) are comprehensive. But is there a weakness in the
abattoirs which could enable infective agents from the brains of cows to
reach the parts we eat? Cows are killed in slaughterhouses by guns with
captive bolts which are discharged into the animal's brain. A team from
Bristol University Veterinary School, Bristol Frenchay Hospital and the
National Blood Service has looked into the possibility the captive bolts
can inject brain material into the animal's bloodstream.
In Veterinary Record, the team reports samples of brain material were
indeed found in the jugular vein of 4 out of 15 cattle slaughtered with a
captive bolt. The results "confirm the potential risk" of this killing
method, say the authors, although they cannot say whether brain material
can reach the arterial circulation and be deposited in edible material.

[Published in the Lancet in September, 1996 was a letter to the editor with
a color photograph depicting 14.5 centimeters of nervous tissue found in
the pulmonary artery of a bovine lung at slaughter. Subsequently, some of
those same researchers showed in yet unpublished results neurological
tissues up to 16.5 cm in the liver. Since neurological tissue that large
can make it through the heart to enter the lungs and the liver, then quite
possibly the smaller particles are making their way into the vessels of
edible tissue. Without question, all of the blood from a hamburger or steak
cannot be eliminated. Presumably the agent or prion may be smaller than a
red blood cell. - Mod.TG]
