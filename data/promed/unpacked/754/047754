An Omani national was admitted on [3 Jun 2018] to The Royal Hospital, Muscat, with severe and complicated _Plasmodium falciparum_ [Pf] malaria, with a parasitemia higher than 100 000. He had visited Dar es Salam [Tanzania] as part of his work. Treated initially with intravenous artesunate in standard doses, the parasitemia decreased slowly. Parasite density after 48 hours was 16 000 Pf [parasites] per microliter; after 72 hours 2000; after 96 hours 421; after 120 hours 200; and after 144 hours (day 7) 80. No further blood films were obtained. After intravenous artesunate for 3 days he received 2 full courses of Coartem (artemether/lumefantrine). He was discharged on [10 Jun 2018].
He was readmitted on [25 Jun 2018] with a relapse, with a Pf parasite density of 1150 per microliter increasing to 6000 per microliter on [26 Jun 2018]. Coartem was started combined with doxycycline 100 mg BID [twice a day].

Comment
-------
The slow decrease in parasite density is comparable to other studies of _P. falciparum_ with reduced susceptibility to artemisinins [Cheeseman IH, Miller BA, Nikhoma S, et al. A major genome region underlying artemisinin resistance in malaria. Science. 2012; 336(6077): 79-82. doi: 10.1126/science.1215966; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3355473/].

[According to the WHO clinical definition of susceptibility and resistance to malaria drugs, illustrated in Fig. 1, pg 31 of the WHO Technical Report Series no. 529. Chemotherapy of malaria and resistance to antimalarials. WHO, Geneva 1973 (http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/41051/WHO_TRS_529_eng.pdf), the patient had an RII resistance to the treatment, defined as an initial fall in parasite density but still parasite positive day 7.]

Molecular analysis of the isolate is in progress.

[Reduced susceptibility to the artemisinin class of antimalarial drugs has only occasionally been reported from tropical Africa. One report included 4 cases (Sutherland CJ, Lansdell P, Sanders M, et al: Pfk13-independent treatment failure in four imported cases of _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria given artemether-lumefantrine in the UK. Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2017; 61(3). pii: e02382-16. doi: 10.1128/AAC.02382-16; http://aac.asm.org/content/61/3/e02382-16.long). This report did not find the Pfk13 mutation currently spreading in SE Asia.

However, an artemisinin resistant _P. falciparum_ clone is currently spreading in South East Asia (Imwong M, Suwannasin K, Kunasol C, et al. The spread of artemisinin-resistant _Plasmodium falciparum_ in the Greater Mekong subregion: a molecular epidemiology observational study. Lancet Infect Dis. 2017; 17: 491-7. doi: 10.1016/S1473-3099(17)30048-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5406483/).

Molecular analysis will show if the SE Asia clone with reduced susceptibility (resistance) to the artemisinins is now found in East Africa. - Mod.EP
