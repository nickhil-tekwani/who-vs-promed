Three family members in Shaanxi's Bin County contract anthrax from sick goat
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
As reported by Xian Evening Post, 3 members of a family in Xinmin Township
of Bin County in Shaanxi Province contracted anthrax after eating a sick
dead goat. The 3 patients are still in isolation and treatment at a local
hospital. Their illness is basically under control. Health departments from
provincial, municipal, and county levels carried out burning and burial of
remaining diseased dead goat(s) the same night.
Those infected with anthrax are members of one family in Baozi Village in
Xinmin Township. Vice director Geng Xinyi of Bin County Hospital told
reporters that the 3 patients were admitted at 3:00 pm on 28 Sep 2006.
After definitive diagnosis of the illness, the situation was felt to be
serious and a report was immediately made to appropriate departments at the
county level. Afterwards, Bin County and Xianyang City health departments
sent the report up to the provincial health department and Ministry of
Health, attracting high-level attention.
By 10:00 pm that night, leaders from Shaanxi Province and Xianyang City's
health departments had rushed to Bin County. Under the auspices of the Bin
County Committee and government, a special meeting was held on how to
prevent and control infectious illness by mobilizing the masses. That
night, Bin County Committee and county government organized over 100
personnel from health, agriculture, public security, and other departments,
dispatching them to Baozi Village of Xinmin Township where they carried out
effective disposal of more than 10 sickened, dead goats through
professional burning and burial.
At present, the 3 anthrax patients are stable, but they will remain in
hospital for treatment and observation. They can be released only after
complete recovery.
Anthrax is an acute, febrile, septicemic, zoonotic infectious disease
caused by anthrax bacteria. The most susceptible animals are sheep, cow,
horse, and other grass-eating livestock. Uncoagulated blood from the
corpses of animals killed by anthrax often flows from natural orifices,
releasing large numbers of bacteria. Anthrax bacteria can survive in soil
for tens of years and remains highly virulent. The mortality rate from this
disease is extremely high.
