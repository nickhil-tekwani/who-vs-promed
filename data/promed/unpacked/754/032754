[Can anybody, please, help in confirming/denying the following PACNEWS
release? If confirmed, this is another very good illustration of dengue
traveling on in the Pacific... - TK].
Health authorities in the Cook Islands have confirmed their first dengue
fever case. According to Doctor Metua Taurarii of the Rarotonga Hospital,
the patient is an Italian visitor who was in Fiji before travelling to the
Cooks, Radio AKTIV Cook Islands reports.
Doctor Taurarii says the patient was admitted at the hospital last Thursday
after seeing a private doctor to check for dengue fever symptoms.

[As dengue viruses are transmitted from human to human, this is the
inevitable manner in which these viruses circulate. Molecular sequencing
of a virus isolate from the patient might clarify the origin and
epidemiology of this strain. Does anyone have further information? What
are the conditions and epidemiologic potential in the Cook Islands at this
time? - Mod.CHC]
