Nicola Pusterla, DrMedVet, MedVet, DACVIM, recently gave an update of what is known about equine coronavirus based on research done at the University of California [UC], Davis, in addition to a review of several case studies.

According to a release from UC Davis, Dr Pusterla reported most affected horses will present as anorectic (98 percent) and lethargic (88 percent) and have an elevated rectal temperature at or above 101.5 F ([38.6 deg C] 81 percent). Less commonly, horses have diarrhea (23 percent), colic (16 percent), and neurologic deficits (4 percent) that might manifest as aimless wandering, head pressing, recumbency, or seizures.

If a horse is not exhibiting signs, it does not mean it is not infected, according to Dr Pusterla's research. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for the virus revealed 10 to 20 percent of horses had detectable virus in their feces yet showed no clinical signs.

Though equine coronavirus was first noted in foals more than 20 years ago, Dr Pusterla said an adult infection of the virus was found in 2011 in a group of draft racing hoses in Japan. The disease spread to groups of adult horses in more than 10 US states from 2011 to 2014. And the disease outbreaks continue to be reported across North America.

Equine coronavirus mostly spreads feco-orally, as opposed to respiratory shedding. Fortunately, the signs of disease usually only last 1 to 4 days with the help of supportive care. Plus, the mortality rate is low -- only 8 percent of infected horses died due to complications of the virus (endotoxemia, sepsis, hyperammonemic encephalopathy) in a recent UC Davis study. To help prevent the spread of the disease, Dr Pusterla recommends enforcing biosecurity protocols where large groups of horses are gathered.

[According to this article, the disease has been found in more than a study group of adult horses, and may be spreading. While this leads me to think the disease is not lengthy or deadly serious, it does have the potential for both. Therefore, it is likely to be an area needing additional resources. - Mod.TG]

[Why these horses that are infected with equine coronavirus have endotoxemia is unexplained in the news report above. Endotoxin is a lipopolysaccharide that is the major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, not viruses. - Mod.ML
