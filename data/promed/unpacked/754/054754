Sounds more like a toxin or poisoning rather than an infectious disease!

Although an outbreak in Nepal of febrile illness associated with
fever and diarrhea is highly suggestive of typhoid, the possibility
of ergotism might also be considered. The ProMED note mentions that
the affected community is involved in the cultivation of millet, a
known substrate for ergot. The symptoms described are suggestive of
"convulsive ergotism" [1], as opposed to the more familiar
"gangrenous" forms associated with skin changes and acral gangrene.

[As Drs. Berger and Katz point out, a toxic etiology cannot be ruled
out, and the mention of millet production in the village would make
this a possible diagnosis. In addition to ergot, there is the
possibility of other chemicals added to the millet.
We await further word from knowledgeable individuals in Nepal for
information on the etiology of this outbreak. - Mod.MPP]
