Kuban Agroholding, an agricultural company controlled by billionaire Oleg Deripaska's Basic Element, killed a herd of 2209 pigs after its 2nd African swine fever outbreak in 12 days, the company said.

A veterinary commission is investigating the farm in the town of Ust-Labinsk in Russia's southern Krasnodar region. In the 1st outbreak at another farm in the same town on 26 Jul 2012, all 5600 pigs were slaughtered, according to company data. There have been more than 20 outbreaks to date this year [2012] in the country, according to Rosselkhoznadzor, the nation's food safety watchdog.

Krasnodar authorities have set up checkpoints on roads in the Ust-Labinsk area, closed markets, and killed all of the pigs in private households in the risk zone around the town, Kuban Agroholding said in an e-mailed statement today [8 Aug 2012]. "These measures are insufficient," the company said. "Even large agricultural companies are unable to stop this disaster on their own. Effective and tough measures by the state are required." The company wants testing equipment to be provided and stricter control over animal feed and vehicles that transport pigs and pork.

ASF is a viral disease for which there is no vaccine. It's deadly for pigs and harmless for humans, according to the United Nations' Food & Agriculture Organization [FAO].
