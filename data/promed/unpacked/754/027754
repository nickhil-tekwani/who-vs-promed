Ho Chi Minh City [HCMC] and some Mekong Delta provinces have experienced an
influx in the number of cases of dengue fever reported, as health officials
struggle to control the outbreak.

According to a Health Ministry report, nearly 36 900 people across the
country have been infected with the mosquitoborne disease so far this year
[2008], 24 per cent down from the same period last year [2007]. Of those
infected this year [2008], 33 have died.

The ministry said that southern provinces and cities have been hardest hit
accounting for 80 to 85 per cent of reported cases. HCMC has reported the
highest number of dengue cases, with more than 6100 patients infected so
far this year [2008], followed by Ca Mau, Soc Trang, and Tien Giang provinces.

The HCMC-based Pediatrics Hospital No. 2 said on Tuesday [26 Aug 2008] that
about 80 dengue fever patients, mostly aged between 5 and 10, were being
treated at the hospital.

Le Hoang Son, director of Can Tho City Pediatrics Hospital, said 40
children had been admitted with the disease. Son said 30 per cent of the
children were from Can Tho while the rest were from neighboring provinces
in the Mekong Delta region.

Last month [July 2008], a large number of dengue fever cases caused several
hospitals in the Mekong Delta region to become overloaded.

The Children's Emergency Department at Ca Mau General Hospital and Soc
Trang General Hospital's Children's Department struggled to cope with the
influx of dengue patients.

In the northern city of Hanoi, more than 222 people have been infected with
dengue fever so far this year [2008], a 21 per cent year-on-year decrease.

Dang Thi Kim Hanh, a secretary for Hanoi's Dengue Fever Control and
Prevention Program, said that as more rain is expected over the next 3
months, the weather will be conducive to the breeding of _Aedes aegypti_
mosquitoes the vector by which dengue is spread.

The use of mosquito repellent may kill mature mosquitoes, but Hanh warns
that mosquito eggs remain a problem and says that eliminating the larvae
should be part of the effort to control the disease.

Nguyen Trung Nghia, director of the Can Tho City Preventive Health Center,
said the city and Mekong Delta provinces were mobilizing local families to
breed guppies to help eliminate mosquito larvae. The guppies, which feed on
the larvae, can be bred in open water areas, which make ideal breeding
grounds for dengue mosquitoes.

In Ben Tre Province, authorities have provided residents in dengue-hit
areas with more than 50 000 guppies over the past 7 months.

The Ministry of Health has approved the testing of a dengue fever vaccine
on locals in the southern province of An Giang. The ChimeriVax vaccine,
produced by international vaccine research and production company Sanofi
Pasteur, will undergo a 6 year trial to test its seroconversion rate
(ability to produce antibodies) against 4 dengue virus serotypes. The
safety of the drug will also be evaluated during the trial.

The Pasteur Institute of Ho Chi Minh City will conduct the trial on 180
healthy people of different ages in the province through 2014. Sanofi
Pasteur, the vaccine division of the France-based Sanofi-Aventis Group, has
already completed 2 trial phases of the tetravalent vaccine.

The latest test results were presented last September [2007] with a 100 per
cent seroconversion rate reported for all 4 dengue serotypes. [According to
a newswire from the Viet Nam news agency submitted by PRO/MBDS Rapporteur
Vern Weitzel "the vaccine has been tested by many countries with a
protection rate of between 83-100 per cent." - Mod.MPP] The 3rd trial phase
was launched this year [2008] in Latin America and Asia.

More than 28 890 dengue fever cases have been reported in Viet Nam this
year [2008], including 28 that have ended in death, according to the
Ministry of Health.

[Given the difficulty in achieving and sustaining mosquito dengue virus
vectors population reduction through community-based breeding site
elimination, vaccines become an increasingly attractive approach to
reducing dengue cases. The challenge has been to develop a single effective
vaccine that elicits a good simultaneous immune response to all 4 dengue
virus serotypes, eliminating the risk of immune enhancement of virus
attachment. - Mod.TY

To date, there have been nearly 36 900 cases and 33 deaths of dengue
reported in Viet Nam during 2008, with more than 6100 cases from Ho Chi
Minh city. While the overall total of cases reported for the country this
year (2008) represents a 24 per cent decrease in reported cases when
compared with reported cases during the same period in 2007, this year has
had significant dengue activity when compared with earlier years. A total
of 3550 cases and 6 fatalities from dengue fever had been detected in Viet
Nam as of 27 Aug 2008 (see prior PRO/MBDS posting Dengue - Viet Nam (10)
20080731.2349).

According to the 2nd newswire, a 6-year vaccine trial of seroconversion
test against 4 serotypes of dengue virus will be conducted in An Giang
province. If the vaccine proves to be safe and effective, it will be a long
awaited tool to reduce the morbidity and mortality due to dengue virus
infection in the region, as it has been a major disease burden not only in
Viet Nam but also in other countries in the MBDS region.

The director of the Disease Control Division of the Health Ministry, Datuk
Dr Hasan Abdul Rahman, said in a statement dated Wednesday [27 Aug 2008],
that 4 deaths due to dengue fever had been reported, one in each of
Selangor, Kuala Lumpur, Melaka, and Johor in the 17-23 Aug [2008] period.
He said in the same period 1003 cases of dengue fever had been reported,
representing a drop of 36 cases from the previous week. "Although there is
a drop in cases it is still about 10 per cent higher than the same period
last year [2007], when there were 910 cases and 31 per cent higher than the
targeted figure of 765 cases," he said in a statement Wednesday [27 Aug
2008]. Dr Hasan said 7 states -- Perak, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, Melaka,
Johor, Terengganu, and Kelantan -- and the federal territories of Putrajaya
and Labuan had recorded increases in dengue cases. He said the states and
the federal territories had 74 per cent or 743 cases of the total cases
reported and to date a total of 29 942 cases of dengue fever with 71 deaths
had been reported. He said inspections by the Health Ministry and local
authorities revealed that residences and shops were primary breeding
grounds of the _Aedes_ mosquito that spreads the dengue fever [virus].

[4] Taiwan
Date: Thu 28 Aug 2008
From: Wu Ping-Fuai <f10282@cdc.gov.tw>


In Taiwan, the primary control measure against dengue adopted is to
eliminate vector breeding sites. In order to prevent the occurrence of
dengue fever outbreaks, Taiwan CDC (Centers for Disease Control) often
appeals to communities and members of the public to mobilize cleanup
efforts to eliminate vector breeding sites.

On the other hand, insecticide spraying is a short term emergency measure
implemented in Taiwan to prevent further transmission of dengue viruses and
occurrence of dengue epidemics. The goal of this measure is for the local
government to immediately apply chemical control of mosquitoes to the place
where the case possibly became infected and the places that the case had
visited after disease onset. Effective spraying of insecticides will result
in killing of dengue virus-carrying _Aedes_ mosquitoes and cutting off the
circle of transmission.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Wu Ping-Fuai for this information and would be
interested in receiving details about the Taiwan approach to
community-based efforts to eliminate or reduce _Aedes_ breeding sites. Dr
Wu Ping-Fuai is correct -- elimination of these breeding sites is the most
effective means for vector mosquito population reduction over the
long-term, but has been difficult to accomplish and sustain in most
countries. We wish them success. - Mod.TY]

A dengue outbreak has been officially declared [in Calasiao] with 23 of the
24 barangays reporting a total of 118 confirmed dengue patients with one
death [A barangay is the smallest administrative division in the
Philippines. - Mod.TY] Mayor Roy Macanlalay, following consultations with
vice mayor Ferdinand Galang and officials from the provincial and regional
health offices, made the declaration and said his administration is set to
address the problem and stop the further spread of the mosquitoborne
[virus] disease.

The last time a dengue outbreak broke out in the town was in 1998 [and it]
claimed 271 victims. Last year [2007], for the period January to 15 Aug,
only 6 cases were reported.

Macanlalay told The Punch that the local government is now making
representations with the provincial office for free hospitalization, as in
1998, for the patients at the Pangasinan Provincial Hospital in San Carlos
City.

The mayor added that they expect more cases given the onset of the rainy
season. Dr Arturo de Vera Jr, municipal health officer, told The Punch in a
separate interview, all the parameters for declaring an outbreak including
magnitude of the areas affected were considered before making the declaration.

He said full blast fogging operations were conducted in the schools [in
Calasiao] last week [week of 18 Aug 2008]. The hardest hit barangays this
year [2008] are San Miguel with 15 [dengue cases]; Malabago, 14; and Lasip,
11. Most of the victims are children while the oldest is 55 years old; the
lone casualty was a teenager.

Dengue fever has reached epidemic levels in Palau as the Ministry of Health
has confirmed 31 cases since 1 Aug [2008].

In a letter to health minister Victor Yano, and Olbiil Era Kelulau (OEK --
Palau's National Congress]) leaders, Bureau of Public Health director Dr
Stevenson Kuartei said that majority of the cases are among school children
from Ngerkebesang, Echang, Meyuns, Ngerchemai, Dngeronger, Meketii,
Iyebukel, Ngaraard, and Aimeliik.

Kuartei in the letter said that many of those who have been diagnosed with
the dengue fever have been admitted to the hospital and some of them are
critically ill with complications of dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock.

Kuartei said that because of the budget reduction for this year [2008],
there is some difficulty in mobilizing adequate resources for community
mobilization, vector control, surveillance, and critical management of
those who have become infected.

"Palau is at risk of a major dengue fever epidemic that will have long
lasting health and economic consequences," Kuartei said. He added that the
Division of Environmental Health, Infection Central Committee, Epi-net, and
Communicable Disease Unit have responded to all of these cases.

Kuartei recommended that in order to deal with the impending epidemic, the
leadership should place the issue as national priority and appropriate
resources to deal with it. He also recommended that the National Avian
Influenza and Emerging Infection Task Force should be activated.

Kuartei also suggested that the outpatient Department (OPD) of the hospital
be closed from 4:30 pm to 9 pm and to see all the outpatients in [the
emergency room] to conserve energy so that government expenditures will
stay within the budget. "While I clearly understand that the Ministry of
Health has to take this drastic action in order to stay within the budget,
but as a director of public health, I must register a strong objection
against sacrificing outpatient especially in the midst of dengue fever,"
Kuartei said.

[ProMED-mail thanks Alice Hadley for providing this article. Dealing with
this outbreak illustrates the effect that financial constraints can have on
providing health services. Obviously, unexpected outbreaks are never
budgeted in advance, so dealing with them means that funds have to be made
available through reduction in other socially important programs and
activities.
