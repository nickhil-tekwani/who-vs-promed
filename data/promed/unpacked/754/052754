of Health
Report says cholera was last seen in the area in 1992, and this outbreak
is due to the low level of water in reservoirs because of the recent
unusually severe drought, which has led people to use artesian wells and
store water unhygienically in gourds.
Maria Valdecy Carvalho, the nurse responsible for the intestinal disease
program of Health Surveillance, said cases have also occurred in the
south of the state less than a month ago, in the region of Reconcavo
Baiano and the city of Ibicarai, near Itabuna, but without fatalities.
Sodium hypochlorite is being distributed to households for them to treat
their drinking water.
