[ECHO-17 has been isolated [from these patients. This enterovirus has
been the predominant serotype associated with enteroviral meningitis [in
recent years. The disease has taken a mild to moderately serious course
without complications. The outbreak has [affected two regions of the city:
from 21 June it was reported from the Leninsk area, then from 7 July in the
Central area.
Specialists from the Center of the State Sanitary-Epidemiological
Surveillance in the Khabarovsk Region stated that the outbreak has
[exhibited a contact-domestic route of disease transmission, [centering
on children's establishments. [Measures have been implemented to contain
the outbreak. A regime of damp clearing with use a chlorine preparations
has been instituted at the children's establishments, and swimming pools

[Aseptic meningitis is a common manifestation of enterovirus infection. In
this outbreak Echovirus type 17 has been implicated. Echoviruses types
11-27 are now ranked as a single group (species) of closely related
enteroviruses. Although non-paralytic poliovirus infection often manifests
itself as aseptic meningitis, the use of poliovirus vaccine to control an
outbreak of aseptic meningitis is an unusual procedure of dubious worth
since there is no serological relationship between Echovirus 17 and
Poliovirus. - Mod.CP
