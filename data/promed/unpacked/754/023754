Residents of Ute Okpu and Idumesa communities in Ika North East Local Government Area, Delta State have been thrown into fear, following the mysterious deaths of over 15 persons within the 18 to 25 years age bracket in the past 2 weeks in the area.

But the State Government has assured residents of the area that it would do everything possible to curb the disease. The State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Mordi Ononye gave the assurance on Sunday [1 Nov 2020] when he led a team of public health officials to Ute Okpu with the view to unravel the mysterious disease that has claimed the lives of over 15 persons.

Ononye said: "Delta State Government has received information on seemingly mysterious deaths in Ute Okpu and Idumesa communities of Ika North East Local Government Area of the State, which prompted the Governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, to direct the State Ministry of Health to immediately investigate these deaths, identify the cause/causes and effect containment measures."

Briefing the Obi of Ute Okpu, HRM Obi Solomon Chukwuka I, of the Governor's directive to upgrade the Comprehensive Health Center in Ute-Okpu to a full-fledged Hospital, he called on members of the community and residents of the State to observe good hygiene as the dry season approaches "by properly covering their food, cutting grasses around their surroundings, eliminate rats in their houses and continue to observe the COVID-19 safety guidelines, especially hand washing with soap and running water.

The State Epidemiologist, Dr. Richard Ikwuogu, said his office had sent officers to the community immediately when the information reached the Ministry of Health, adding that the active case search that commenced the previous day continues.

Ikwogu said his team has visited the families of the affected persons in the community and also the cases in the hospital in Umunede, collected their samples, and interviewed them. He said though a suspicion of viral hemorrhagic fever, or substance abuse, the outcome of the test on collected samples will give clear information on the disease and that will determine the next line of action.

On his part, HRM Obi Solomon Chukwuka I, thanked Governor Ifeanyi Okowa for giving the directive for the health center in his domain to be upgraded, expressing relief that government's intervention through the visit has brought hope to them and assurance that the disease would be curbed.

He assured the Commissioner and his team of the co-operation from him and his subjects and encouraged them to feel free and let him know of any challenge they may come across when interacting with residents of the community.

In the Commissioner's entourage were the Zonal Medical Director Agbor Zone; Zonal Hospital Administrator Agbor; State Epidemiologist; State Disease Surveillance and Notification Officer (DSNO); Executive Secretary, Health Ika North East LGA; Council's DSNO and Health Educator; 2 representatives of the World Health Organization (WHO), among others.

[The above report provides little information about these fatal cases other than their 18-25 year ages. Hemorrhagic disease and substance abuse are mentioned as possible etiologies without any clinical support for either etiology. The mention of preventing rats from entering houses suggests concern about Lassa fever as a possible cause of the deaths, although the absence of any cases outside of the relatively narrow age range of victims would be unusual for Lassa fever.

ProMED-mail would be interested in receiving information about the results of the laboratory tests that will be undertaken. Determination of the etiological agent responsible for the deaths will be essential for health officials to take appropriate preventive measures necessary to avoid additional cases.

These deaths are unrelated to the undiagnosed April 2020 deaths of over 1000 people due to COVID-19 in Kano state, Nigeria. - Mod.TY
