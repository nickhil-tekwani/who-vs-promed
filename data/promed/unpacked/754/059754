Minas Gerais has 48 suspected yellow fever cases, says the Secretariat
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Minas Gerais state Secretariat of Health stated on this Wed 11 [Jan 2017] that the number of suspected cases of yellow fever increased to 48. Of these cases, 16 are considered probable since the patients presented with the criteria for suspected cases, according to the Health Surveillance Guide, and had preliminary positive laboratory results. Confirmation still depends on more investigation.

The cities with most probable cases among these 16 are de Minas, with 3, and Caratinga, Ubaporanga and Ipanema with 2. Also there are probable cases registered in the cities of Inhapim, Piedade de Caratinga and São Domingo das Dores, Itambacuri, all in the Rio Doce Valley; and Frei Gaspar, Ladainha and Poté, in the Mucuri Valley.

Currently, the city with the most suspected cases of the 48 reported is Ladainha with 10, followed by Caratinga and Piedade do Caratinga with 6 in each city.

Of the 14 deaths suspected due to the disease, 8 are considered probable, according to the Secretariat. That is to say they have had positive tests and other factors that are still being investigated.

In Entre Folhas and São Sebastião do Maranhão, both in the Rio Doce Valley, no probable cases were registered, but there were cases of dead and ill monkeys registered.

The Secretariat stated also that the transmission in the rural area is related to the _Haemagogus_ mosquito. Yellow fever [virus] is also transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_, but just in urban environments. There have been no investigated cases in urban areas.

Notification began on this past 5 [Jan 2017]. The Secretariat issued an alert for those traveling to those cities to be current for vaccination. Also said was that the vaccine is available and resupply has now been requested from the Ministry of Health.

The last case of rural [sylvan] yellow fever was registered in Minas Gerais in 2009, with no urban cases since 1942, according to the agency.

The Ministry of Health reported that 450 000 doses of vaccine against yellow fever will be sent to Minas Gerais this Thursday [12 Jan 2017].

The governments of Ladainha and Teófilo Otoni declared a state of emergency due to the suspected cases of the disease.

The government of the state published this Thursday (12 [Jan 2017]) a decree creating a situation room in order to monitor the cases of yellow fever in Minas Gerais. A committee will be composed of representatives of Civil Defense, the State Secretariat of Health, the Ministry of Health, Government Secretariat and the State Secretariat of the Environment.

[Fortunately, so far all cases have been spill-over from the sylvan (forest) cycle of transmission and not person-mosquito-person in an urban cycle. However, there is the risk that one of these individuals might arrive in an urban setting while viremic, triggering an urban cycle should both _Aedes aegypti_ and unvaccinated individuals be present, as occurred in Paraguay in 2008. The concern expressed for and actions taken by the health agencies is justified. - Mod.TY

A man died after contracting yellow fever in Ribeirão Preto
-----------------------------------------------------------
A 52-year-old man died after contracting yellow fever in a rural area of Ribeirão Preto, in the interior of São Paulo state. According to the municipal Secretariat of Health, the patient went to the health network [facility] with symptoms of the disease and after 4 days was admitted and died on 26 Dec [2016]. The cause of death was confirmed on Tuesday, 3 [Jan 2017] by the Adolfo Lutz Institute.

This was the 2nd yellow fever death in the state in 2016. In April [2016], a 38-year-old man died of the disease in Bady Bassit, São José do Rio Preto [see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160509.4209766].

In these 2 cases, the patients were in forest areas having monkeys, possible hosts of the virus. The regions of Ribeirão Preto and Rio Preto had dead monkeys infected with yellow fever [virus] in 11 municipalities between July 2014 and December 2016. The [human] victims were not vaccinated against the disease. Preventive measures were taken in the 2 cities to prevent new occurrences.

[Cases of yellow fever (YF) were popping up in monkeys in various localities in Sao Paulo state last year (2016). Reports of dead monkeys indicate that there was sylvan (forest) yellow fever (YF) virus circulating in various localities in São Paulo state. Other than the 2 human cases cited above, there have been no other reported human cases.

Despite these YF infected monkeys indicating that sylvan (forest) transmission is occurring, the risk of spill-over into the human population is real. Timely immunization of humans in these areas is prudent and is an effective measure to prevent initiation of an urban transmission cycle with many human cases. The comments of Mod.RNA in 2 previous reports of the Sao Paulo state sylvan cases of yellow fever in 2016 are instructive.

A 1 Dec 2016 report posted in ProMED-PORT (in Portuguese) indicated that the dead monkeys were howlers, a species commonly involved in the sylvan cycle of YF virus transmission, and indicators of the presence of virus in the area. - Mod.TY]
