During one of my visits to the only captive Asian elephant colony,
consisting of 27 Asian elephants in the heart of New Delhi, on 25 Feb 2001,
I found 2 animals showing clinical signs of foot and mouth disease (FMD).
Upon inquiring the mahouts [keepers and owners, I was informed the animals
have been showing signs typical of FMD since Feb 10. The fact 2 animals had
died within one and a half months, with at least one of them showing signs
typical of FMD, was also noted.
Vesicular lesions were found in the corners of the mouth, upper hard
palate, and in the feet, especially around toenails, with associated foot
rot. The soles of the 2 animals were getting detached or were half-attached
to the feet.
Samples from the lesions were collected and have been sent for typing of
the virus, although the scabs were drying off. Many of the pustules were in
a state of healing. Serum samples have also been collected from the
infected animals for antibody titre estimation. Efforts are underway to
collect blood samples from the rest of the surviving animals for antibody
titre estimation.
The captive elephants are housed among over 500 domestic (cattle, buffalo,
sheep, goat and pig) and domesticated (camel) animals, which are either
unvaccinated or have no known vaccination history against common infectious
diseases.
Source of infection could be from domestic animals from the same area
(though no cases were brought to our notice) or from domestic animals from
other areas, where the elephants go to for foraging or for work.
Additionally, the entire animal colony is located close to one of the most
unhygienic inland water systems.
FMD outbreaks have been reported in the last 1-2 months within 300 km
radius, in some cases even more than that in northern India, which is being
diligently investigated by a vaccine major [? in India.
No fresh cases have been noticed or reported from the area since the 2
elephants were found to be showing signs typical of FMD. Reports of sick
elephants from a captive population in Dudhwa National Park were also
received, although no further information is available on the nature of the
disease or any clinical signs exhibited the elephants.
With reports of FMD coming in from very many species in the past few
months, across geographical barriers, over a very large land area, it is
likely a pandemic is in progress and many more species are likely to get
infected.
Although this is unlikely to have much significance for wild elephant
populations across range states, either for the Asian or African species
(no known reports or yet to be detected), it definitely could be of
importance for the captive elephant population, primarily the Asian
elephant, which is found in large numbers in the Asian subcontinent and
reportedly is very susceptible for FMD.
The above report also contains information from Dr. Jacob Cheeran, OIE,
Wildlife Diseases committee member, who is also part of the investigating
team. A coordinated team is working to type the virus and get more
information. Once we are successful, we shall have more info on the
outbreak for dissemination.
I would very much appreciate the input of the ProMED-mail readership on
known reports/ publications on FMD occurrence in elephants.
