South Dakota cattle producers are encouraged to include anthrax vaccine in their vaccination program when they turn out cattle to summer pastures. Recent flooding may increase the risk of cattle encountering anthrax this season [2019], according to Dr Dustin Oedekoven, South Dakota State Veterinarian.

Anthrax is caused by bacteria that can develop into an environmentally resistant spore form when in the soil. Under the right conditions, these spores can become available for cows to graze. Once ingested by cattle, the spores become activated and produce toxins that cause rapid death. Anthrax can be prevented in cattle by administering a vaccine which is widely available, inexpensive, and very effective.

While the anthrax risk has been well-documented in many parts of South Dakota, and anthrax vaccination of cattle is routine in those areas, it is not always possible to predict where cases may occur. Flooding is an environmental factor which may aid in making anthrax spores available to livestock. Cattle going onto pastures that have previously experienced flooding or into areas where anthrax has been documented in the past, should be considered prime candidates for vaccination.

If anthrax is suspected contact your local veterinarian or the animal industry board [AT ONCE]

"During the summer, producers should take time to check all cattle frequently," says Oedekoven. "Cattle producers need to promptly investigate any unexpected deaths on pasture, whether in cows, bulls, or calves," continues Oedekoven. "With anthrax and many other diseases, treatments and preventive measures are available, and prompt action can help prevent excessive losses." If a producer suspects anthrax, the case should be reported immediately to local veterinarians or to the State Veterinarian at 605-773-3321. Suspect carcasses should not be moved or disturbed until a diagnosis has been made. "Local veterinarians are excellent sources of information for cattle producers regarding anthrax," Oedekoven said.

[The South Dakota chief veterinary officer Dustin Oedekoven raises a fair point. We are seeing extensive flooding and excess rain throughout the mid-west prairie states of the US -- traditional cattle rearing areas -- where anthrax has occurred frequently in the past, not just South Dakota. On many ranches the infected carcasses were buried, not burnt. Under normal circumstances any surviving spores associated with that historic carcass or the soil column above it would present little risk unless some major digging were done, such as, correcting drainage or putting in a road. But this rain and flooding has the capacity to float spores up to the surface -- spores are hydrophobic. I know of events where a carcass was displaced and the spores ended up on a water meadow downstream. So while outbreaks of livestock anthrax are not the only risk during the recovery period, black quarter comes to mind, remember to regularly check your stock. Every day is not too often, plus after a busy day contemplation of one's grazing cattle is calming. And get them vaccinated.- Mod.MHJ
