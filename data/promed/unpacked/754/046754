Utah Department of Agriculture and Food State Veterinarian Dr. Barry Pittman is using a recently diagnosed disease, infectious thrombotic meningoencephalitis (ITME) in a Sanpete County herd as a reminder to cattle producers to be vigilant for signs of increased stress in their cattle herds.

"This disease, although not a reportable disease in Utah, is of concern, as the lesions were highly suggestive that the causative agent was _Histophilus somni_, previously known as _Haemophilus somnus_, a bacterium associated with 'shipping fever' and considered a commensal of bovine mucous membranes," stated Dr. Pittman.

Dr. Pittman indicated this was probably caused by stress in the herd due to the recent unrelenting weather events of continuous snow and rain and temperature fluctuations. This disease poses no threat to human health.

Dr. Pittman also stated the state sees 5-6 cases of this disease a year sporadically in beef and dairy cattle. It usually manifests in individual animals or in up to 2-3 animals in a herd for several weeks to a month, then resolves.

It is not uncommon to see this disease with and without pneumonia when it occurs. It usually strikes quickly, and antibiotic therapy may not be effective due to sudden onset.

"Our cattle producers are well aware of the stress these weather patterns cause to their herds and the difficulties that arise to ensure their animals have adequate access to feed, water and shelter in adverse conditions," Dr. Pittman said.

"This information is a reminder to continue to do what producers are doing: checking the herd more often, assessing the health of their animals, and consulting with their local veterinarians for possible treatment regimens and preventive measures such as vaccines," he added.

[Any adverse weather conditions, or abrupt changes in weather can stress any person or animal. Cattle and other animals exposed to the elements are especially sensitive to diseases because of weakened body conditions during these times. Producers should always be weather-wise regarding their animals.

"_Histophilus somni_ (_Haemophilus somnus_) is a common disease-causing bacterium of cattle, with a large proportion of cattle carrying antibodies to the organism. _H. somni_ tends to be an opportunistic pathogen that complicates viral infection and increases the severity of infection with other bacterial agents. _H. somni_ can infect several organ systems after it spreads through the bloodstream, giving rise to the term _H. somni_ complex. Respiratory infection often precedes infection of other organ systems. The respiratory, genital, nervous (brain, thromboembolic meningoencephalitis, TEME), circulatory, and musculoskeletal systems (joints) can be affected, either individually or together.

In some areas, _H. somni_ is considered a major respiratory pathogen and one of the 3 major bacterial participants in the shipping fever complex, along with _Mannheimia haemolytica_ and _Pasteurella multocida_. The incidence of any of the _H. somni_ syndromes is not known with certainty, but when all the disease forms are considered together, they make _H. somni_ an economically significant pathogen."
