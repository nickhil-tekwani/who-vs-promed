Poland confirms case of African swine fever in farm pigs
--------------------------------------------------------
Polish authorities have identified the country's 1st ever case of African swine fever (ASF) to be found in farm pigs, the chief veterinary officer said on Wednesday [23 Jul 2014; see comment]. Previous cases of ASF, in wild boars, promoted Russia and China to impose restrictions on Polish pork exports, causing a fall in domestic pork prices.

"This is the 1st case of ASF in farm pigs in Poland," chief veterinary officer Marek Pirsztuk told Reuters. "The area lies 3-6 km [1.8-3.7 mi] from the border with Belarus." He also said that about 200 farm pigs from the danger zone of 7 km (4.3 miles) around the county of Grodek [in Podlaskie voivodeship, 1st level administrative division] may have to be put down. This is the same area where 9 cases of ASF in wild boars were identified earlier this year [2014]. Pirsztuk added in a statement that the case of ASF had been identified in a farm with 5 pigs. 2 of them died and the remaining 3 have been put down. The farm has been disinfected, he said.

According to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) there is so far no effective vaccine against ASF, but the disease poses no danger to human health.

Lithuania to slaughter 20 000 pigs as swine fever spreads
---------------------------------------------------------
Lithuanian authorities on Thursday [24 Jul 2014] ordered the slaughter of 19,400 pigs at one of the country's largest farms as an outbreak of African swine fever (ASF) in the region spread.

It was [the] 1st case of ASF to be found in farm pigs in the Baltic country, chief veterinary officer Jonas Milius said, amid an outbreak in which cases have appeared in neighboring countries. "We will not take additional measures to contain the fever, as we have already been operating as if a full scale outbreak is under way," Milius told Reuters in a telephone interview.

Latvia, which has also found cases, has suspended imports of Lithuanian raw pork and pork meat products. Poland has also reported ASF cases at farm pigs near its border with Belarus. [For Latvia's situation, see section 3 below].

ASF was found after pigs in the Rupinskai farm [in Ignalina district, Utena County] near the Belarus and Latvia borders began dying in larger numbers than usual on Wednesday [23 Jul 2014] , the farm's owner, Danish firm Idavang, said.

The farm was taken over by the veterinary service after the virus was confirmed in the dead pigs. All pigs on the farm will be exterminated, Idavang said. The company is the biggest pig farmer in Lithuania with 525 000 pigs at 11 farms, it said on its website [see comment].

According to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) there is so far no effective vaccine against ASF, but the disease poses no danger to human health.

[3] Latvia: domestic swine and wild boar, spread

Latvia extends emergency zone for African swine fever
-----------------------------------------------------
On Tuesday [22 Jul 2014], Latvia declared a state of emergency in a 2nd area of this Baltic EU state as efforts continued to contain an outbreak of deadly African swine fever in its pig population.

The extension of the emergency quarantine zone means large swathes of Latvia's borders with Belarus, Estonia, Lithuania, and Russia now fall within it. Inside the zone, animals cannot be moved between farms, [access to infected farms is restricted], and inspectors can order culls on the spot.

The government also approved measures Tuesday [22 Jul 2014] including compensation for small farmers who have had to slaughter diseased pigs and broader rights for veterinary inspectors in accessing private property.

Prime Minister Laimdota Straujuma warned Tuesday [22 Jul 2014] of "major losses" to the farming sector unless the disease is contained, with Russia and Belarus already slapping blanket bans on Latvian pork products.

Straujuma blamed wild boar crossing in from Russia for Latvia's 1st-ever outbreak of the disease, detected on 26 Jun 2014. Since then, a total of 26 wild boar and 19 pigs on 11 farms have tested positive for it, and 185 pigs have been put down.

Experts believe it first emanated from Belarus, and was also confirmed earlier this year [2014] in wild boar in fellow European Union members Poland and Lithuania.
