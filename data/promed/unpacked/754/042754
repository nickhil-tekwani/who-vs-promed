Residential areas at former pig farming areas in Lukut that were hit by the
[Nipah viral encephalitis [VE outbreak this year will be declared safe
for occupation by the end of this week. Of the 999 houses that were
evacuated in Bukit Pelandok, Kampung Baru Sungai Nipah and Kampung Sawah in
Lukut since the the VE pig culling operation began on 20 Mar 1999, 941
houses
have been declared safe for occupation.
[State Health director Dr Ramli Rahmat said the area on the whole was now
perfectly safe and there are now no restrictions on the movement of people
there. He said: "The department will however continue to monitor the area
including holding mosquito and disease surveillance there. We are also
following up on VE patients who recovered and their families." Dr Ramli
said the Seremban hospital conducts special VE clinics on Fridays for the
VE follow-up checks.
He said VE patients who had recovered were required to visit the clinic for
checks seven times over a one-year period after their discharge from
hospital. "It is vital that these people come for their scheduled checks.
Department officers would be despatched to seek out those who fail to turn
up," he added.
Dr Ramli said about 226 people from pig farming areas in the State had been
warded [hospitalized with suspected VE this year; 83 succumbed to the
disease.
He said there were still 3 patients being treated at the Seremban
hospital for suspected VE with 2 stable cases and one still ill, adding
that there were another 7 patients in hospitals in Kuala Lumpur.
[The Nipah viral encephalitis follow-up of patients who have recovered, I
was informed, has yielded evidence of relapses in at least 5 patients.
During the outbreak, we have discussed the question of viral persistence in
our postings. It was pointed out that in Australia a patient developed
encephalitis over a period of 14 months after an initial Hendra virus
infection. The finding of disease relapse in Nipah viral encephalitis
patients is disturbing and I hope official confirmation and detailed data
are forthcoming from Malaysia. - Mod. CYC

[The suggestion that relapses occur is disturbing. That the term "viral
encephalitis" or "VE" is still being used is also, but not equally,
disturbing. Looks like someone in the Malaysian Government intends to
stonewall right to the bitter end. That mosquito surveillance is even
mentioned tells where the mind set is. Nipah virus is not transmitted
biologically by mosquitoes; i.e., it is not an arbovirus. The worry
about mosquitoes is residual from the early days of the epidemic when the
Malaysian Government mistook the early cases of Nipah encephalitis for
Japanese encephalitis. There is a long way to go. - Mod.CHC
