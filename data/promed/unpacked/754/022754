Date submitted to OIE: 2 Dec 2010
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 1 Apr 2009
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H5

New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Yasugi city, Shimane
Date of start of the outbreak: 27 Nov 2010
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Species: birds
Susceptible: 21 606
Cases: 57
Deaths: 57
Destroyed: 21 549
Slaughtered: 0
Affected population: poultry (layer)

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.
Epidemiological comments: an outbreak of HPAI was confirmed on 2 Dec
2010 in Shimane prefecture. The previous outbreak of HPAI in Japan
started in April 2008. The event has been contained in the affected
farm by control measures including stamping-out and movement restrictions.

On 29 Nov 2010, a local veterinary officer visited the farm
immediately after notification from the owner. Although no remarkable
increase of the mortality was recognized, the local veterinary
service centre in the prefecture confirmed that 3 out of 5 samples
taken from dead birds were influenza A virus positive by
antigen-capture kits. On the same day, the centre confirmed the
subtype was H5 by RT-PCR test.

On 1 Dec 2010, the National Institute of Animal Health affirmed an
isolate was due to influenza A virus subtype H5 by HI test. On 2 Dec
2010, the institute confirmed the cases as highly pathogenic avian
influenza because the isolate caused 75 percent mortality in
4-week-old chickens infected intravenously, and the amino acid
sequence of the connecting peptide of the haemagglutinin was the same
as that observed for the highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses
isolated from faeces of wild ducks in Hokkaido in October 2008.

Killing of the susceptible animals started on 30 Nov 2010 and was
completed on 2 Dec 2010. Incineration of the carcasses and
disinfection of the farm are continuing. A movement restriction zone
was established within 10 km [6 mi] around the affected farm on 29
Nov 2010. In addition, the traffic around the affected farm was
restricted. There are 4 poultry farms in addition to the affected
farm in the zone. They are also under surveillance. A total of 13
disinfection stations were established in and around the restriction zone.

Control measures
Measures applied: control of wildlife reservoirs; stamping out;
quarantine; movement control inside the country; screening;
disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); vaccination
prohibited; no treatment of affected animals.
Measures to be applied: no other measures

[Obviously, this outbreak is of some concern as the previous outbreak
was in wild birds and this one is in commercial poultry. It appears
that mortality is not very high with only 57 of the 21 606 birds
affected (0.26 percent morbidity). This low morbidity rate is despite
the fact that the virus has been confirmed as an H5 and it is a
highly pathogenic virus. Also, according to the data reported here,
there is a high case fatality rate of 100% percent, that is, all of
the 57 affected case birds died.

It is very good that there are only 4 farms within the restricted
zone and that they are under strict surveillance for clinical
disease, which is aimed at preventing spread in commercial flocks.

The previous case in 2008 occurred in 8 swans comprising 5 outbreaks
in the very north of the Island of Honshu and on Hokkaido and far
away from this new location. It appears that the same strain that
affected the wild birds is affecting the commercial poultry but a
thorough epidemiologic investigation is warranted.

I am copying the OIE event summary for the 2008 outbreak in swans
below (see
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&this_country_code=JPN&reportid=7003>):

The swans, of which 3 had died and one was emaciated, were found on
the shores of Lake Towada in Akita Prefecture in the north of the
country on 21 Apr [2008]. Until 28 Apr [2008], the authorities have
been monitoring the area but they have not found any incident with a
large number of deaths in wild birds. There are no chicken farms
within the 10-km [6 mi] radius area where the swans were found and no
unusual incidents were observed in other farms. Following the
occurrence of this event, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries of Japan has asked the prefecture authorities of Akita,
Aomori, and Iwate, which share the boundary of the shores of Lake
Towada, to strengthen the monitoring of the farms in order to prevent
the spread of the disease thorough early detection and to report the
measures applied regarding abnormal chickens and the prevention of
the entry of wild birds into poultry houses. The prefecture
authorities will visit the 15 chicken farms for emergency on-site
inspections within a 30-km [19 mi] radius area where the swans were
found immediately. They will also monitor the wild birds around the
area and cooperate with the Ministry of Environment on the
surveillance measures of wild birds.

outbreaks. - Mod.PC]
