Rift Valley Fever Death Toll Reaches 33 in Saudi Arabia
-------------------------------------------------------
JIZAN: Agriculture and Water Minister Abdullah ibn Muammar has been camping
in Jizan ever since Rift Valley Fever was discovered in the region. He has
been conducting daily inspections, holding meetings with the local
community, and monitoring the work of the disease-fighting teams.
The death toll from the viral disease increased to 33 yesterday, a Health
Ministry official said. The number of people affected by the virus had risen
to 160, he said, adding that 30 of them have recovered and left hospitals.
The minister said that 18 planes would join the fight against the
potentially fatal disease on Thu 28 Sep 2000 in such a way that even heavy
rainfall could not hamper the teams activities. The minister said a special
committee would estimate the number of cattle killed by the disease before
the cause of the death was identified. There are statistics, however. on the
number of deaths after the disease was diagnosed (about 11 600).
Compensation will be paid on the basis of prevailing market rates, the
minister said.
With the help of experts from South Africa the source of the disease will be
pinpointed in the next 10 days so that potentially dangerous locations can
be isolated. Currently the team is collecting samples from diseased and dead
animals. Spraying operations to exterminate mosquitoes are also continuing
unabated. Muammar said South African experts had found that a considerable
number of villages had not been affected by the disease. All healthy cattle
in these regions will be vaccinated against the disease in order to avert
the possibility of it recurring. The minister also gave assurances about
fool-proof plans to eradicate mosquitoes in the region. Aerial sprays and
manual spraying around farms and houses were being undertaken all the time,
he said. The minister also confirmed that diseased animals would be killed
with the help of experts in such a way that the operation would not
adversely affect nearby towns or people. The ministry has been co-operating
with the Ministry of Health to find out how the disease is transmitted to
humans, he added.
Muammar also said special arrangements would be made to stop the smuggling
of disease-ridden animals from Jizan to other regions. All entry points will
be watched carefully and aerial reconnaissance will be carried out. Several
attempts to smuggle out animals from Jizan had already been detected and
stopped,he added. The minister revealed that the spraying of insecticides
was being undertaken by 5 planes specially designed for such work. Eight
helicopters and several planes will be added to intensify the operations,
which will continue for at least 3 months.

WHO Statement on Rift Valley Fever in the Middle-East: Acute Haemorrhagic
Fever Syndrome in Yemen
------------------------------------------
The Yemen Ministry of Health has reported 113 human cases, including 30
deaths of suspected Rift Valley fever in Wadi Mawr, Al-Hudaydah Governorate
in northern Yemen. 266 animal deaths have also been reported, mainly of
sheep and goats but some cattle and camels have been affected. The first
case occurred on 10 Sep 2000.
The Minister of Health has formed an Epidemic Committee consisting of the
Ministries of Health and Agriculture, and a team of international experts
from WHO, the United States Naval Medical Research Unit (NAMRU 2 - a WHO
Collaborating Centre in Egypt) and epidemiologists and laboratorians from
Oman. An expert from The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization
(FAO) will be joining the team shortly.
A laboratory is being set up in the outbreak zone to analyses all human and
animal samples collected there. The team will carry out further field
investigations, entomological and ecological studies. They will also assist
in implementing control measures, including case management and health
education. The Yemen government has already established a Help-line for
health workers and the general public.
There is a [concurrent outbreak of [confirmed Rift Valley fever in Saudi
Arabia in the area bordering Yemen and this acute haemorrhagic fever
syndrome in Yemen may be related. Relevant government ministries in both
countries are coordinating efforts to ensure a joint approach to outbreak
investigations and response activities.

Possibility of Further Spread of Rift Valley Fever?
---------------------------------------------------
The arrival of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in the Middle East is clearly very
worrying, especially for those countries. I would raise one other worry.
Another viral disease of livestock has moved from Africa to the Middle East
in recent years, i.e. Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR). This virus has since
moved on to South Asia i.e. India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal. What are the
chances that RVF could follow this route if it isn't eradicated from Saudi
Arabia and the Yemen? Were it to do so, the outcome would probably be a
disaster on a large scale. So this move by RVF may have much greater
implications in the future and should spark a serious international response
to eradicate it from Saudi Arabia and the Yemen.

[A significant epidemiological difference between RFV and PPR is that the
former is caused by an arthropod-borne bunyavirus, whereas PPR is caused by
a predominantly aerosol-transmitted paramyxovirus. However, if illegal
smuggling of stock is a factor in spread of these diseases, this difference
would not be relevant. - Mod.CP
