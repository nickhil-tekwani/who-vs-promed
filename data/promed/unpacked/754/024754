A review of recent lay press articles available on Nexis shows no further
citations regarding the death of salmon in Norway's fish farms due to the
algae _heterosigma_.
However, it appears that an analogous piscine event is occurring in Scotland
-- with the suspected etiologic agent being Infectious Salmon Anaemia (ISA)
virus. Farms owned by four different companies are involved. The source of
the outbreak in one company was felt [sic; believed to be 270,000 smolts
bought from a Loch Nevis farm of a Norway-based firm. The outbreak has
resulted in nine Scottish highland salmon farms being sealed off. ISA has
been confirmed at a fish farm in Loch Nevis. Tests are continuing on fish
taken from a second farm in Loch Snizort, in Skye, and, as a precaution,
other farms in the area are subject to surveillance and health inspections.
Marine Harvest McConnell confirmed that its Greshornish salmon farm on Skye
was one of nine farms on which precautionary movement restrictions had been
placed following a suspected outbreak of ISA. Production director Dr Graeme
Dear said they were co-operating fully with the Scottish Agriculture,
Environment and Fisheries Department and would carry out whatever
instructions it issued. "Greshornish is a fairly small farm and one of 39
operated by Marine Harvest McConnell throughout the West Highlands, Skye and
the Western Isles."
ISA has never been identified in the UK or elsewhere in the European
Community; it has been classified as a List 1 disease under the EU Fish
Health regime. The virus has previously been identified only in Norway and
Canada.
The ISA virus does not affect humans, although they can act as mechanical
vectors in the process of infecting other fish. As there is no treatment,
eradication of the disease will require slaughter of the fish and
disinfection of the farm and equipment.
The outbreak resulted in the introduction of statutory movement restrictions
banning the transfer of all fish and fish eggs.
A request has been made that anyone who has observed deaths in Atlantic
salmon contact the Marine Laboratory at Aberdeen at 01224 876544.

[If the proposed cause of this disease appearing in Scotland is correct, it
will be interesting to see how many other European countries directly or
indirectly importing smolts will also diagnose and report this disease. -
