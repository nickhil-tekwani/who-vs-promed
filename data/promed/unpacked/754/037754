Two farms near the town of Rocky Mountain House in the Rocky Mountain
foothills have been quarantined after 20 cows died from anthrax.
Public health inspector Dr. Greg Ritz said about two weeks ago cows started
dying. He said when tests were done on the carcasses it was confirmed
they'd been infected with the bacteria, believed to have been in the soil
where the cows were grazing. The remaining cattle have been immunized and
there is no threat to humans.
