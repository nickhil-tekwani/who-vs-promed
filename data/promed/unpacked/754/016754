The patient, a 51-year-old male, presented with fever and back pain following his return from a trip to Japan. During his stay, he visited Yoyogi Park in Tokyo. On presentation, he was febrile to 39 deg C [102.2 deg F]. The diagnosis was confirmed with a positive NS1Ag [nonstructural protein 1 antigen test]; dengue virus IgM and IgG were negative. Other investigations were consistent with dengue virus infection with a lymphopaenia and elevated ALT to 177 U/L. The platelet count was normal.

Yoyogi Park in central Tokyo has been implicated in a number of [autochthonous] cases of dengue fever in Japan, with the Ministry of Health reporting over 70 cases as of 6 Sept 2014 (http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/06/world/asia/rare-outbreak-of-dengue-fever-in-japan.html). Locally acquired cases of dengue have also been recently reported in Saitama City north of Tokyo (ProMED-mail archive no 20140828.2731079). A case was also reported in a returned traveller to Germany in September 2013, with Fuefuki, west of Tokyo, felt to be the most likely place of acquisition (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20681).

Although the usual vector of dengue fever, _Aedes aegypti_, is not present in Japan, a cold-tolerant species, _Aedes albopictus_, is known to be present in parts of the country (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11931270). Most cases of dengue in Japan are thought to be imported, but large outbreaks have occurred in the past, most notably in 1942-45 (https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/tmh/39/4SUPPLEMENT/39_2011-S07/_pdf).

[ProMED-mail thanks Emma Paige and Allen Cheng for the report above. Although there are occasional reports of dengue virus imported into northern Queensland state from various areas with ongoing transmission in Southeast Asia, this is the 1st report of a case imported into Australia from Japan.

_Aedes aegypti_ is present in northern Queensland leading to ongoing transmission occasionally. However Melbourne is located on the south coast of Victoria state and it seems unlikely that _Aedes aegypti_ is established there, but confirmation of absence of these dengue vectors or other competent mosquito vectors would be of interest.
