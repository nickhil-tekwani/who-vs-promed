Suspected amoebiasis outbreak in Philippine village
-----------------------------------------------
Local authorities on Saturday [25 Nov 2006] ordered deployment of
health personnel after an outbreak of amoebiasis in remote tribal
villages in Binicalan, San Luis town, Agusan del Sur killed 24
persons. The National Communities on Indigenous People (NCIP), the
provincial government of Agusan del Sur, the local government of San
Luis town and health authorities joined efforts to contain the
disease to prevent it from spreading to other villages. Elvira
Catuburan, chief of the region's technical and operation division of
NCIP, said that at least 117 persons affected by the disease were
still under medication.
"Our brother natives need medical attention to stop amoebiasis,"
Catuburan stressed. Government authorities raised suspicion that the
outbreak was caused by contaminated water in the area.
The municipal government of San Luis declared an outbreak, as the
disease continues to affect some 300 residents since early last month
[November 2006]. Binicalan village has no clean sources of potable
water, it was learned. Catuburan and his team, Dr. Psyche Nebrada of
NCIP and Dr. Alladin Plaza, San Luis health officer, and several
medical practitioners found that the water in areas of Malatado,
Guisaw-an and Tamyang, all of Barangay Binikalan in Kilometer 25, are
already contaminated with amoebas.
At least PHP 500 000 [USD 10 000] was already drawn from the local
health fund, while Gov. Plaza distributed P100,00 [PHP 100 or 100
000? (USD 2.00 or 2000?)] worth of medicines. The local government
asked for more financial assistance as aid earlier extended to the
victims was already depleted. Mayor Chua said the Banwaon highlanders
believed that the outbreak was caused by contaminated water, poor
personal hygiene and improper disposal of waste.
Amoebiasis is caused by eating food and drinking water contaminated
by amoebas. Government authorities are continuously conducting
information drives on how to combat the illness. "We are doing our
very best to stop this illness," Plaza said

[It is very unusual for amoebas to cause waterborne outbreaks, and
the posting does not mention why infection with _E. histolytica_ is
suspected. A waterborne outbreak in an area with no access to clean
water, as stated in the article, would much more likely be caused by
bacteria like that of cholera, _Salmonella_ or pathogenic _E. coli_.
Comments on the diagnosis and investigation ruling out bacterial
etiology would be welcome. - Mod.EP]
