The beef industry is still working on investigations started by an Alberta cow in September 2016.

As of 3 Nov 2017, the number of positive bovine tuberculosis cases remains at 6, and all 6 cases are from the same herd. This herd has been released from quarantine.

Karin Schmid, Beef Production Specialist with Alberta Beef Producers, says the trace-in testing, which looks at animals sold to the index herd to determine whether they were the cause of the infection, is right on track.

"The number of herds actually involved in the trace-in testing is many fewer than we had 1st anticipated. The quarantines are quite a bit shorter for the most part. The communication through the utilization of case officers has been quite successful in terms of using those case officers to communicate directly with the affected trace-in producers and schedule testing."

30 ranches will be tested in Alberta as part of the trace-in activities, and 9 Alberta ranches have already been tested and released.

Schmid says that all of the on-farm testing should be done by Christmas.

"I think, for the most part, they (the affected ranchers) are getting back to a normal routine. The ranches that did have to go through that depopulation process are undergoing restocking testing right now, so that's still one piece that's outstanding because there are 2 separate restocking tests. And so, their final restocking test will be next fall [2018]."

About 11 500 animals were destroyed with compensation, and 17 500 animals have been released from quarantine.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is working with the Provincial Government to ensure that any risks associated with TB in wildlife are included in the investigation. They will do this by monitoring elk in southeast Alberta.

[The cost of this TB investigation is quite high. There were a lot of animals terminated. This is hard on the owners as well as the government coffers. However, the cost of having TB is more expensive as this disease can cost a territory much in trading. This slow insidious disease is devastating to all involved. We are glad to hear that this is investigation may be winding down. - Mod.TG
