Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan urged people not to hide poultry to
escape bird flu culls while residents in the east where 3 children died of
the disease pleaded on Saturday [7 Jan 2006] for more help.
A team of World Health Organisation (WHO) doctors who flew to Turkey to
investigate the 1st human bird flu fatalities on the threshold of Europe
were stuck in Ankara due to fog.
The European Commission said its laboratory at Weybridge, England, had
confirmed that the strain of bird flu found in Turkey is the deadly H5N1
form of the virus. The virus killed 74 people in east Asia before it
claimed the lives of the 3 children from the same family in eastern Turkey
this week. Some of the victims had played with the severed heads of
infected birds, doctors said.
Experts plan to study the outbreak for signs the virus was passing from
person to person, mutating into a form easily transmitted among humans.
Experts say a pandemic among humans could kill millions and cause massive
economic losses.
Erdogan urged people not to hide their poultry and promised compensation.
He said the government was taking all necessary measures and allocating
funds to combat the spread of the disease, CNN Turk reported.
"Peoples' losses will be compensated. Nobody will be allowed to suffer
losses," he told reporters on Friday.
"We should not panic. Our people should not be making efforts to hide
chickens, turkeys or geese," he said.
The Ministry of Environment and Forests banned hunting of all wild birds
throughout Turkey and asked hunters to avoid contact with them.
Despite government efforts, residents complain that even after they ask for
assistance, chickens are not being taken away for days. Some say they do
not have money to pay for trucks to bring poultry to the city centre for
culling.
"We apply to the officials but they don't come to take our chickens. I
cannot bring them myself. I have no money," a middle-aged man said in
Dogubayazit, the town where the dead children lived, near the Armenian and
Iranian borders.
A Reuters reporter saw chickens still walking on the streets, and some
escaping just before they were carried in large bags to be buried alive in
pits.
Turkish television reported that a prosecutor in the eastern town of Kars
had begun an investigation into culling poultry by burning them in [pits]
because causing pain to animals is illegal.
4 members of a family from Sanliurfa, near the Syrian border, who fell ill
after eating a sick chicken, were in hospital for observation, an official
said. A family of 7 people, including 5 children, from the eastern town of
Ardahan, was sent to hospital in Istanbul on Saturday, also on bird flu
suspicions.
Elsewhere, people say hospitals are overcrowded and doctors do not examine
and treat them adequately, sending them home after brief examinations. In
some areas, trade in poultry continued as normal and people expressed
doubts the disease even exists.
A Reuters stringer in southeastern Diyarbakir said people still slaughter
chickens on the streets in front of children. "We don't have bird flu in
this city," a man who bought a turkey from a street seller said, showing
the bird to cameramen.
A poultry seller complained the government pays 7-9 lira (USD 5.25-6.75)
compensation for a turkey, which is normally sold for 30 lira in the
market, and that is why they do not want to give their poultry to officials
for culling [see next item].
"These bird flu rumours are produced intentionally to raise lamb sales.
There is no problem with our poultry," a street seller said.

Owners of winged animals are experiencing a great deal of anxiety due to
the deaths from bird flu in Eastern Turkey.
These concerns have caused unique scenes in the region. The fear of
becoming infected with bird flu has initiated some people to destroy large
numbers of poultry on their own instead of calling officials. Oblivious
killing of animals is posing a high risk of helping the virus to spread.
The bird flu death toll increased to 3 when another patient diagnosed with
the disease died while receiving medical treatment in the eastern Turkish
city of Van.
The other 15 patients are still receiving medical treatment. The country is
on alert for the bird flu virus which easily spreads among birds.
Large numbers of these animals were exterminated in 8 cities. Some people,
however, are destroying the animals on their own rather than calling
experts to deal with the situation, creating a higher risk of turning the
disease into an epidemic.
With the fear of being infected by the bird flu virus, people are also open
to the danger of the bird flu even if they do not eat chicken meat simply
by touching the animal. The experts urge for owners of diseased animals to
notify the officials.
Omer Faruk Tatli, a resident in the Merzan district of Hakkari, neglected
to ask for the Provincial Agriculture Office to appoint a group of experts.
Unable to make sense of why his poultry animals were dying one after the
other, Tatli became worried over the bird flu reports. He was far more
frightened at hearing that the disease was spreading by the migrant birds,
since in recent days a large group of birds were flying over the area he
was living in. So, Tatli took a decision to kill all his chickens. Catching
the chickens one by one, Tatli and his mother destroyed the animals in
front of the house. The Office of Agriculture insists public should avoid
having direct contact with the birds, leaving the killing to the experts
instead.
The animal owners will be financially compensated for the killing of their
animals, said Mehmet Mehdi Eker, the Minister of Agriculture.
The owners will be paid 5 new Turkish lira [3.75 U.S. dollars] per chicken.
For the killing of one goose, the amount will be 10, and for the killing of
one turkey, 15 liras will be paid in compensation.

Officials in regions infected by bird flu in eastern Turkey have complained
over what they described as a too slow response by the authorities to bird
flu alerts in the remote area, some of which were dated 2 months ago.
2 children who perished over the past week in a hospital in Van city were
confirmed to have been infected with the H5N1 strain of avian influenza,
while 2 other people carrying the virus remain under treatment, along with
some 30 other patients suspected of being infected.
Asim Hacimustafaoglu, governor of the neighboring Bitlis province, where
the presence of bird flu was officially confirmed Saturday [7 Jan 2006],
said the samples had been sent to laboratories run by the agriculture
ministry 2 months ago. "The examination took a long time. The results of
pigeon samples that we sent 2 months ago were revealed only yesterday," he
told Anatolia. "It became clear -- unfortunately -- that the pigeons died
of bird flu." [see comment].
In the province of Agri, officials and residents raised similar complaints.
Mehmet Sulun, the sub-governor of Eleskirt district, said they received the
positive results of tests about a month after agriculture ministry experts
collected samples, Anatolia reported.
A village headman told the agency he was forced to seek the help of a
bureaucrat he knew in Ankara several days ago after poultry in the village
continued to perish for a month after veterinary experts collected samples
but did not inform them of the results.
"This person told me over the telephone to immediately make an announcement
from the mosque loudspeaker and warn the people to stay away from winged
animals. Then he faxed us the results," Yildirim Ozmen from Ciftepinar
village said.
The Turkish Union of Veterinarians accused the government of falling into
"lassitude" after it successfully contained the 1st bird flu outbreak in
the country in a fowl farm in the northwest in October 2005.
"Our fears materialized as the joy of overcoming the disease led to an
atmosphere of lassitude," the statement said.

[The rate of H5N1 spread in Turkey, in domestic as well as in local wild
birds, is in need of a urgent assessment. The 5 official notifications sent
by Turkey so far did not mention disease in wild birds, including pigeons
(which might be semi-domesticated); according to the official reports, the
species clinically affected on farms were chicken, goose, turkey and ducks;
positive laboratory results related to sampled chicken and ducks. In
addition, it has been alleged that the disease is also geographically more
widespread than was earlier reported.
If allegations that the disease has been spreading, at least in Eastern
Turkey, for weeks or even months are confirmed -- then the heroic but
belated attempts to apply stamping-out policy in domestic birds kept in
small numbers (and in many cases within human dwellings), might be almost
sisyphean. If the spread is found to be -- fortunately -- still limited,
stamping out may have a chance of success only if the compensations to
farmers and owners are realistic, and payments timely.
The early establishment of the affected territories will allow making
decisions on the disease prevention and control policies to be applied.
These might differ in the different provinces, according to their
epidemiological status; regionalisation or compartmentalisation principles
might be referred to. If the disease has taken wide dimensions, vaccination
might not be excluded in selected areas/compartments.
In the meantime, special attention should be devoted to public education.
This is particularly important in the coming week, when many households in
Turkey (similarly to other Muslim countries) are expected to consume
increased quantities of poultry meat, during the annual Eid-Ul-Adha
festivities. Though, as stated by the WHO, the consumption of cooked
poultry meat is permitted, those engaged in the slaughtering process are
required to take precautionary measures. In countries -- such as Turkey --
where house slaughtering is widely practiced, especially in rural areas,
this is a cause for concern. - Mod.AS]

Tests on dead birds in Azerbaijan showed bird flu was not the cause of
poultry deaths in the south of the country, a senior veterinary official
said on Saturday [7 Jan 2006].
The birds were taken for tests in the capital, Baku, from the Massaly
region after about 200 birds died in 2 villages.
"It is not bird flu -- it was some other poisoning," Emin Shakhbazov,
deputy head of the country's veterinary service, said on state television.
"We are investigating the reasons for the poisoning."
The Massaly region is near Azerbaijan's border with Iran and about 500 km
(300 miles) southeast of the remote Turkish district where a bird flu
outbreak has killed 3 children.
Azerbaijan has banned poultry imports from Turkey and Iran on public health
grounds.

[In another newswire, sourced by A-Lan Banks from RFE/RL's Azerbaijani
Service, the veterinary authorities stated, "the recent large number of
bird deaths in the [Massaly] region were caused by other diseases that have
yet to be determined. Tests are under way to solve the mystery".
Gross pathological findings of the dead birds and results of the current
tests -- to exclude avian influenza -- will be helpful. - Mod.AS]
