3100 hepatitis C cases, only 87 stated
--------------------------------------
A deadly virus has gripped people battling a more serious disease of poverty. Down with hepatitis C, more than 1600 poor people in Baghapurana, 600 in Langeana village, 900 in Badhni Kalan town and many more in the surrounding areas in this district are in a lonely struggle. Instead of installing hepatitis test facilities at the civil hospitals of Baghapurana, Badhni Kalan and Nihal Singh Wala, the Health Department has tried to cover up the epidemic. Its survey teams recorded only 87 cases of the disease.

"The survey was an eyewash and done in haste for the sake of filing a report," said Charanjit Sharma, a teacher at Langeana, a [badly] affected village that no team ever visited.

The ruling Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) party had made an election promise of solving Moga's 10-year-old hepatitis-C problem, recalls social worker Gurtej Singh Brar of Langeana. "Where's the solution?" said Charan Singh of Baghapurana, former subedar [junior commissioned officer] in the army.

A total of 4 residents of Langeana found out they had hepatitis when they went to donate blood at a camp in their village. That was 3 years ago. "In the past 10 years, the Health Department has never organised any camp for the hepatitis-C examination," said one of them. 5 people from 2 poor families of Sukhanand village visit a baba (witch doctor) every Sunday to get rid of the curse.

"We have no money for treatment," said one of the people seeking relief. "We are a family of 6; how can my 2 sons and I get any medicine for hepatitis-C from any private hospital."

Additional deputy commissioner Joram Beda accepted the seriousness of the situation. "The health department does hold examination camps from time to time," he said. "Many private doctors, however, do not report all the hepatitis cases to us. I will seek a detailed report and do an investigation."

[Hepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with the hepatitis C virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C virus is usually spread when blood from an infected person enters the body of a susceptible person. It is among the most common viruses that infect the liver. Hepatitis C is found worldwide. Countries with high rates of chronic infection are Egypt, Pakistan and and China.

Hepatitis C virus is most commonly transmitted through exposure to infectious blood. This can occur through receipt of contaminated blood transfusions, blood products and organ transplants; injections given with contaminated syringes and needle-stick injuries in health-care settings; and being born to a hepatitis C-infected mother. Hepatitis C may be transmitted through sex with an infected person or sharing of personal items contaminated with infectious blood. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food or water or by casual contact.

It is unclear why the incidence of hepatitis C appears to be high in the Indian state of Punjab. Treatments for hepatitis C virus infection are becoming available, but remain beyond the resources of most countries with large populations. The WHO recommends that the risk of infection can be reduced by avoiding unnecessary and unsafe injections, unsafe blood products, use of illicit drugs and sharing of injection equipment, unprotected sex with hepatitis C-infected people, and tattoos, piercings and acupuncture performed with contaminated equipment.

Punjab is a state in the northwest of the Republic of India, forming part of the larger Punjab region. The state is bordered by the Indian states of Himachal Pradesh to the east, Haryana to the south and southeast and Rajasthan to the southwest as well as the Pakistani province of Punjab to the west. It is also bounded to the north by Jammu and Kashmir.
