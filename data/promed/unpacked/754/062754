Saturday is market day in the town of Amizour, about 20 km (about 12.5 mile] southeast of Bejaia. The souk is finally open, after more than 2 months of closure due to the occurrence of foot and mouth disease [FMD], a disease that affects cattle, sheep and goats. The 1st FMD case in the province of Bejaia was reported on 28 Jul 2014 in Sidi Aich. A few weeks before Eid El Adha, livestock traders can again use the 9 markets of the province. This is a good opportunity for them.

However, the spectrum of the disease this summer still lurks in the minds of customers. "I do not know what they call 'open markets under veterinary control,' but I have not encountered any veterinarian at the entrance of the market," said a farmer who runs a small unit in the mountains. "Our sheep are healthy," say the farmers. As one of them said: "The virus has not affected sheep flocks; the disease affects only cattle. And the price that customers consider very high (approximately 700 and 400 USD respectively for rams and lambs) are not the result of lack of product or any pressure on livestock markets. The main factor in the rise in prices is the elevated cost of feed. Anyway, I think the costs have not changed much compared to last year [2013] during the same period."

An unsatisfied customer who had just bought his sheep found that "losses due to disease in animals, as well as the approaching Eid Al Adha (Muslim sacrifice feast), are 2 excuses to keep the price very high. Some will tell you that they lost sheep because of the disease, although they have been compensated."

In this regard, the veterinary inspection of the wilaya of Bejaia has identified 87 farmers concerned with compensation and representing 188 farms. It is true that the sheep population was less affected, but the same service recorded 876 animals infected with FMD, including 43 sheep. The veterinary inspector in Bejaia believes that the alert must be maintained, given the observed negligence of the measures taken in view of the opening of livestock markets.

To this end, it was decided to prohibit the installation of enclosures in neighborhoods or other places besides the new livestock markets available to the province that are under the control of veterinary services. Another measure is vaccination of animals which will continue, affecting more than 48 000 head of both sheep and cattle. However, some instructions such as the control of livestock movements at the entrance and exit from the market are seemingly not respected.

[According to Algeria's reports to the OIE addressing the current FMD epizootic, as last summarised on 9 Sep 2014, only cattle have been infected in the 418 officially reported outbreaks (infected holdings) since its start on 23 Jul 2014. The morbidity rate (percentage) on the infected farms was 38.5. On several of the infected premises, sheep (a total of 1572) and or goats (200) were kept as well, but in both species, the morbidity rates were, according to the reports, nil (0.00 percent). All these 1772 animals were, reportedly, slaughtered, regarded to be exposed contact animals.

The absence of FMD in sheep was subject to earlier discussion (see commentary in 20140910.2764083), particularly since the same virus strain reportedly did cause disease in Tunisian small ruminants: in sheep 9.9 and in goats 8.7 percent morbidity rates.

According to the information in the current (above) media report, cases of FMD have been recorded in (43) sheep in the Algerian province Bejaia. It will not be a surprise if such cases occur in sheep and goats everywhere else, since no FMD vaccination has been applied in Algeria's sheep or goats for years (this, in contrast to Tunisia). Confirmation or otherwise is requested.

FMD in sheep and goats may cause high mortality in their offspring (up to 50 percent and beyond in lambs and kids under the age of 1-2 months) due to cardiac arrest ("pancarditis"). In adult sheep, the main FMD symptom is lameness, transitory pyrexia and inappetence; in dairy sheep, the milk production may be considerably reduced, and mastitis may occur. Mortality in adult sheep is mostly low (usually less than 3 percent), unless gangrenous mastitis develops. Sometimes, FMD infection in sheep may show a subclinical course; however, these animals are effective disseminators of infection. Samples from small ruminants should be obtained according to the Probang method, applying probang cups as described in FAO's guidelines "Diagnostic and Sampling procedures for FMD:" slide 11 in the presentation at http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/commissions/docs/training/material/Diagnostic_sampling_procedures/Diagnostic_sampling_procedures.pdf).

Algeria's total sheep population (2013 statistics) is 26 572 980, kept on 346 031 "units" (holdings). Vaccinating all of them is, indeed, not feasible, certainly not within the short time frame available. However, strategic vaccination, and vaccination of high-value breeding stock, deserve to be considered at the soonest. - Mods.AS/AB
