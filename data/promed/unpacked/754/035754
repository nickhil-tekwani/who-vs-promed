Reporting, epidemic growth, and reproduction numbers [letter]
Date: Mon 3 Feb 2020
From: Ashleigh R. Tuite, PhD MPH, David Fisman, MD MPH [edited]

The global infectious diseases community is focussed on the reported epidemiology of the 2019 nCoV epidemic in China and other countries. Over the last several weeks cumulative, virologically confirmed case numbers have risen sharply, and currently (February 3, 2020 in China) stand at 17,386. We now know quite a lot about this new pathogen, including its genetics, incubation period, serial interval and reproduction number, which facilitates construction of simple models of this disease. We can use such models to compare reported counts to model-based projections. Such comparisons give us insights into both the changing nature of case finding, and epidemic growth.

Suppose we were to model this epidemic as a communicable disease starting in mid-November 2019, with a serial interval (average time between cases in a chain of transmission) of 7 days, a basic reproduction number of 2.3, and no control. This very simple model would be well-calibrated to 2019-nCoV case estimates (1723 cases on January 12, 2020; 4000 cases on January 18, 2020), generated by a group at Imperial College (based on exported case counts and travel volumes). If we then compare cumulative case numbers to case numbers generated by this very simple model, we would see that reported case numbers remain lower than modelled case numbers, but ascertainment is increasingly complete over time.

Based on Imperial College estimates the fraction of cases reported increased from 2.4% on January 12 to 11% on January 18, 2020. Our model would suggest that (assuming R remains close to 2.3) this had increased to 59% by January 31, 2020 (9,930 reported cases today vs. 16857 modeled cases). If the reproduction number has been reduced by control efforts since mid-January (as seems likely), the fraction of cases reported is even higher. An example of the output from one such simple model is available at https://figshare.com/articles/nCoV_Reporting_and_Control/11788932. We have created an interactive tool which produces such curves, and which is available via the Internet at https://art-bd.shinyapps.io/nCov_control/.

The narrowing gap between modeled and virologically confirmed cases is important for several reasons. First, it shows that the massive public health effort underway in China is, increasingly, ascertaining nCoV cases. As identification and diagnosis are important to prevent ongoing spread, this is encouraging. Second, the large leaps in reported cumulative case counts don't only represent disease activity, but also a surveillance effort which is "catching up" with an epidemic. Third, for a given R0 (say 2.3), the decreasing horizontal distance between modeled curves and reported cases provides a semi-quantitative index of decreasing reporting times (from more than 10 days on January 27 to approximately 4 days currently).

We can also use simple models to infer ranges of plausible effective reproduction numbers since control measures were introduced in China. If we assume that control efforts were ramping up by January 24, 2020 (the date of fully implemented quarantine in Wuhan, and control efforts throughout China), we can modify model projections based on a given reduction in reproduction number. The epidemic curves associated with a given effective reproduction number (Re) after intervention on a particular date can be plotted as a series of "contours", similar to altitude values on a map. It can be seen that such contours give us information about which (average) reproduction numbers may be plausible, and which are be implausible. For example, if we assume that average Re had been reduced to 1 after January 24, 2020, we would see fewer cases than are currently being reported. As such, this average level of control is not plausible. By contrast, reduction to an average Re of 1.5 is plausible, based on reported cases and model estimates up to February 3, 2020, but would also imply complete reporting.

We can also continue to plot case counts against such projections moving forward; if cumulative case counts flatten, and begin to intersect with "contour lines" horizontally, either control is improving and the mean reproduction number is falling or (a pessimistic interpretation), case ascertainment efforts are flagging due to limited laboratory or human resources. Conversely, if reported case counts cross the contour lines above them, that would imply an ever higher minimum value for Re.

A final insight from these plots is that even after the epidemic peaks, and reproduction numbers decline to 1, the total epidemic size continues to grow. It needs to be remembered that the rate of infection among susceptibles (so-called "force of infection") is both a function of the transmissibility of the disease, and the number of prevalent infecting cases. As such, when an epidemic becomes sizeable, we still expect to see large numbers of incident cases when the reproduction number falls to 1, and even after the reproduction number falls below 1. This nonetheless represents a kind of victory, as a reproduction number of 1 indicates that the epidemic has peaked. Reproduction numbers below 1 mean that incidence will inexorably fall with time and the epidemic will end.

[ProMED thanks Dr Tuite and Dr Fisman for their contribution, in particular the interactive modeling tool that they have created and are now generously sharing with the ProMED community. This is a very worthy follow-up to Dr Fisman's letter about nCoV transmission dynamics (see Novel coronavirus (19): China (HU) transmission dynamics 20200126.6918012).

Please go to the URLs provided above for the representative figure and the interactive app. By allowing the user to change R0 and other independent variables in this modeling tool, one can immediately visualize how small changes can dramatically change the shape and slope of the epidemic curve, and thus gain insights into epidemic growth. - Mod.LXL.]
