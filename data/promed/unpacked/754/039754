Queensland Health is investigating a 2nd outbreak of food poisoning at the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre [BCEC] that came a week before a major salmonellosis outbreak afflicted hundreds of school principals. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) has reported at least 10 people became sick during a Fundraising Institute of Australia conference at the centre. The conference was held a week before the Education Queensland conference on 26-27 Feb 2015, when 250 people were struck down with gastrointestinal symptoms. 5 of the Fundraising Institute of Australia conference attendees were diagnosed with salmonellosis, the ABC reports.

The body's chief executive, Rob Edwards, said several conference attendees had been hospitalized with salmonellosis. "It's just an unfortunate circumstance to happen," he said. "People go to a conference, have an enjoyable time, and then to go away with food poisoning is not a great outcome I would have thought," he told the public broadcaster. "They [BCEC] have now asked us to put these folk into contact with Queensland Health, who are actually tracking the problem down as I understand."

Principals from all over Queensland attended the 2-day conference last week [26-27 Feb 2015] that has caused the 2nd worst salmonella outbreak in the state's history. The state's worst salmonella outbreak was on Melbourne Cup Day in November 2013, when 350 people were affected.

Catering company Piccalilli Catering blamed bad eggs used to make mayonnaise for that outbreak.

The cause of the most recent outbreak at BCEC is still subject to a Queensland Health investigation but the centre has suspended supplies of eggs and poultry products as a precautionary measure.

[It is not stated whether the serotype of _Salmonella enterica_ is reported in either cluster and whether they were identical by genetic testing. Either way, issues clearly occurred previous to the larger outbreak but it is not clear who knew and when it was known regarding the 1st cluster. - Mod.LL
