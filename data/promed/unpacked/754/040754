Statement on undiagnosed nervous condition in ruminants
-------------------------------------------------------
The [UK] Veterinary Laboratories Agency [VLA] has recorded what is
possibly a new condition in ruminants in England.
A short item was considered by the UK Zoonoses Group on a nervous
condition in a heifer that had suffered partial leg paralysis. It was
initially diagnosed as suspected botulism.
The UK Zoonoses Group's [UKZG] remit includes consideration from a
public health angle of new and emerging diseases, such as the case
brought by the VLA in April 2004.
Tests on the animal at VLA Penrith, Cumbria, showed on microscopy
lesions suggestive of a viral infection in the brain. There was no
evidence of a Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy.
Possible virological causes were followed up, including louping-ill,
infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) and West Nile virus. All
proved negative to the tests. The lesions were also not consistent
with Borna disease infection or rabies infection.
Over the last 10 years, 21 similar cases from 13 premises have been
identified by the VLA as a result of their examination of routine
submissions. The VLA carries out extensive surveillance and
diagnostic work on material submitted by private vets for their
farming clients. In the submission of the material, a diagnosis is
not reached in every case.
A similar pathological condition has been recorded in Switzerland
following surveillance similar to that carried out by the VLA.
The issue was raised at the UKZG in advance of publication of a
letter to the Veterinary Record, alerting vets and farmers of the
findings. The letter is due to be published shortly.
Further investigation is ongoing, and the Health Protection Agency is
to lead a risk assessment on the new condition. Chief Veterinary
Officer Dr Debby Reynolds has asked that this be done as a matter of
urgency.
NOTES:
The UK Zoonoses Group (UKZG) is a high-level forum for the discussion
of animal and human health aspects of zoonoses (diseases and
infections transmissible between animals and man) and their control,
chaired by the UK Chief Medical Officers. Its terms of reference
include providing an overview and means of ensuring overall
co-ordination of public health action at the UK, national and local
level with regard to existing and emerging zoonotic infections.

Undiagnosed condition in ruminants
----------------------------------
The differential diagnosis of tetraparesis/paralysis in cattle
includes botulism, metabolic disturbances including hypocalcaemia,
trauma, breed-related disorders and viral encephalitides such as
louping ill.
Here we report a case of in a Holstein heifer with a provisional
clinical diagnosis of botulism, based predominantly on the clinical
findings of flaccid paralysis. Further reasons for the suspicion of
botulism were the presence of a dead crow in the water trough in the
field; that there was a large chicken broiler unit 3 km from the
farm; and that there had been a previous case of suspected botulism,
3 months previously, at a neighbouring farm 1 km away. Although no
definite source was identified in that case, the clinical signs and
history were typical, and no alternative diagnosis was obtained in PM
examination. The present case became recumbent following progressive
flaccid paralysis over 5 to 6 days. Moderate weakness, hind-limb
ataxia and a slightly stiff gait were also noted in a 2nd heifer,
which gradually recovered over several weeks.
The recumbent heifer was euthanised and submitted to the Veterinary
Laboratories Agency (VLA) - Penrith for a PM examination. No
macroscopic lesions were noted. Histological examination revealed
subacute bilateral non-suppurative and necrotising
polioencephalomyelitis, characterised by perivascular cuffing, glial
nodule formation and occasional neuronal necrosis, mainly involved
dorsal and ventral horns (first cervical segment of the spinal cord),
medullary reticular formation, vestibular complex and red nucleus.
Immuno-staining for louping ill virus, bovine herpesvirus type 1 and
West Nile virus antigens were negative. Joest-Degen bodies and Negri
bodies characteristic of Borna disease virus and lyssavirus
infections (respectively) were not detected. 10 in-contact heifers,
including the recovered animal, were seronegative for louping ill.
The differential diagnoses of bilateral polioencephalomyelitis in man
are neurotropic viral infections and paraneoplastic encephalosis
(Love and Wiley 2002). Louping ill virus infection, the only cause of
encephalitis of this distribution and character currently recognised
in ruminants in the UK, was ruled out in this heifer. Over the past
10 years, 21 cases of ovine and bovine non-suppurative and
necrotising polioencephalomyelitis characteristic of neurotropic
viral infection but negative for louping ill antibody and/or antigen,
from 13 farms throughout England, have been detected by regional
laboratory surveillance. A full set of laboratory data is not
available from many cases, because these were identified
retrospectively.
However, preliminary laboratory data, immunohistochemical results and lesion
distribution strongly suggest that the lesions observed in these sheep and
cattle are unusual or new presentations of encephalitis caused by a known
virus or one or more novel viruses. It is possible that the causative agent
is a common ruminant virus that is only occasionally neurotropic, for
example, an enterovirus. Theil and others (1998) found no evidence of rabies,
Borna disease or tick-borne encephalitis in similar cases of viral-type
encephalitis in a series of 48 cattle in Switzerland, although they presented
preliminary evidence of possible morbillivirus infection in 4 cases.
In the absence of a reliable confirmatory test for botulism in
cattle, this case illustrates the importance of ruling out other
possible causes of tetraparesis/paralysis in cases of suspect
botulism. Further research work will be required to identify the
causative agent(s) of these ruminant polioencephalomyelitis cases.

[Anyone engaged with the diagnosis of botulism in cattle is familiar
with the frustrating difficulty of obtaining reliable, clear-cut
laboratory confirmation of suspected clinical cases. Similar to the
observations of the authors in the current case, in many cases
diagnosis has to be based upon clinical and circumstantial indirect
evidence (see references). The authors deserve to be commended for
extending their investigation to include histopathological and
immunological examinations. This case demonstrates the importance of
forwarding specimens from a maximal number of suspected cases to
laboratories or investigation centres. It is possible that similar
findings will be encountered in other countries, provided
laboratories are properly equipped and diagnostic services are
readily available to farmers and practitioners. Since gross economic
interests -- and, most important, public health -- might be at stake,
such diagnostic services should be easily accessed, with maximal
state support and minimal bureaucratic or financial barriers.
The public-health aspects of the described case have not been
addressed in the paper. They might have been overemphasised in the
media. This might be the product of 2 main factors: the involvement
of UKZG, and the use of the (correct!) term polioencephalomyelitis,
which led the media to regard the case as being "polio-like", thus
related to human health.
The Swiss paper referred to, written by workers of the Institute of
Animal Neurology, BSE Reference Centre, University of Berne,
indicated that 51 such cases diagnosed over a period of 10 years were
examined retrospectively to investigate whether they constituted one
or more distinct diseases, and to search for etiological agents. PCR
amplification for chlamydial DNA was negative in all but 1 of 32
specimens.
Immunohistochemistry did not demonstrate the presence of chlamydial
antigens, either in the one PCR-positive case or in the other cases
examined. Immunohistochemistry for rabies virus, Borna disease virus,
and central European tickborne encephalitis virus was negative. In 4
cases, immunolabelled cells were found in the lesions with antibodies
against paramyxovirus antigens.
Though this might just reflect the highly efficient Swiss veterinary
surveillance system without -- in the current case -- BSE-related
implications, interestingly Switzerland was the 1st country in
continental Europe to identify, as early as 1990, endemic BSE.
Further results from the ongoing investigations, with special
reference to excluding human-health hazards, and -- foremost --
observations in other parts of the UK and the world at large, are
anticipated. - Mod.AS]
[I find the situation unsatisfactory for the following reasons. Amazingly,
NO EM work is reported, which could clarify rabies or the fascinating clues
to morbilli/paramyxovirus involvement. Rabies was not given as a
differential diagnosis in the UK case, and apparently not excluded -- the
absence of typical lesions and of Negri bodies mentioned is not conclusive.
There are numerous reports of lyssaviruses (rabies group viruses) in bats in
Europe, including the UK -- see: Rabies, bat - UK (Lancashire): confirmed
20021002.5447, on an infected bat that bit a woman. Why were there no viral
isolation attempts in mice or tissue culture, or brain histo-chemistry for
lyssaviruses? - Mod.JW]
