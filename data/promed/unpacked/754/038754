The Norwegian Veterinary Institute has, for the 1st time, found the scabies mite _Psoroptes ovis_ on llama.

Earlier in 2015 the mite was identified in 3 herds of alpaca.

The mite causes sheep scab, a highly contagious disease in sheep with great significance for the economy and welfare.

The positive sample was found in the ears of a llama who was sent to the Institute for an autopsy. The llama, who was from an animal park, had been ill for a period and was sent to NMBU [Norwegian University of Life Sciences] Veterinary School where it was killed.

At autopsy samples were taken from the ears and _Psoroptes ovis_ was detected in both. There were no clinical signs of scabies mite infection.

It is not known to what extent _Psoroptes ovis_ with llama and alpaca can be transmitted to sheep or other livestock.

[The 1st identification of _P. ovis_ in alpaca in Norway was reported in archive no 20150204.314090.

A review of psoroptic mange of South American camelids (SAC), is included in the following 2008 paper:
Aiden Foster. Skin diseases of South American camelids. British Veterinary Zoological Society Proceedings, 2008. Psoroptic mange, p 30; http://www.cabi.org/isc/FullTextPDF/2009/20093040038.pdf:

"The typical lesion of infestation is crusting associated with papules and serum exudate from the site of where the mites have been feeding on superficial exudate and skin debris by abrading the stratum corneum of the epidermis with their mouthparts. Pruritus and fibre loss are particularly associated with the pinnae and ear canal, although the pruritus and mite distribution have also been reported to be generalised and not to include the ear canal. Other locations may include the shoulders, back, sides, tail head, perineum, nares, axillae, groin, neck, and legs.

"There is currently some debate about the identification of psoroptes mites, and so it is prudent to call SAC isolates _Psoroptes_ sp. until further analysis has been carried out. There is an obvious concern about SACs being a potential reservoir for the infestation of sheep with sheep scab mites.

Microscopic examination of superficial skin scrapes and ear swabs rubbed into the vertical ear canal and then rolled into liquid paraffin on a slide should enable identification of the mites with their characteristic morphology. Chorioptes mites may also be found in the ear canal and on the pinnae."

There are 5 recognised forms of scabies in sheep, classified according to the species of mite involved:
1. psoroptic (common scab);
2. sarcoptic (head scab);
3. chorioptic (foot scab);
4. demodectic (follicular mange);
5. psorergatic scabies (itch).
