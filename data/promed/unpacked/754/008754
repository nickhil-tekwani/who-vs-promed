Egypt: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 4
-----------------------------------------------
As of Thu 13 Apr 2006, the Ministry of Health in Egypt has informed
WHO of the country's 12th case of human infection with the H5N1 avian
influenza virus. The patient is an 18-year-old girl from the northern
governorate of Minufiyah. She developed symptoms on 5 Apr 2006 and
was hospitalized on 11 Apr 2006. She remains hospitalized in stable
condition. As with all other cases in Egypt, her infection has been
linked to direct contact with diseased birds.
Samples from the patient tested positive for H5N1 infection in the
country's Central Public Health Laboratory and the Cairo-based US
Naval Medical Research Unit 3 (NAMRU-3).
Of the 12 cases in Egypt, 3 have died and 4 remain hospitalized. The
remaining 5 patients have fully recovered and been discharged from
hospital.

[The location of the Minufiyah governorate can be found by accessing
the map of Egypt at
<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/english/htmain.htm>. It lies to
the north of Cairo in the Nile delta (at 6 on the map).
As of Wed 12 Apr 2006, the cumulative number of confirmed human cases
of avian influenza A/(H5N1) reported to WHO is now 194 with 109 deaths
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2006_04_12/en/index.html>
Notwithstanding the above WHO Update reporting 12 cases and 3 deaths
for Egypt, the number of confirmed cases for Egypt in the Cumulative
Table remains at 4 cases with 2 deaths. The reason for this
discrepancy is unclear. - Mod.CP]
