[I have included the original outbreak report as well as the
follow-up report a week later. It is very good to get an update on
the outbreak, especially since the follow-up provides details on more
farms and seemingly includes a different farm type. It is important
to find out the vaccination history and specific FMD virus type
resulting in both this outbreak as well as the previous one in 2005,
which occurred in the same province as the current outbreak. - Mod.PC]
