[1] USA: doctor from Sierra Leone was treated with ZMapp, plasma

The latest Ebola patient flown the United States for treatment died today [17 Nov 2014] despite receiving 2 experimental treatments: the drug ZMapp and a blood transfusion from an Ebola survivor, officials with Nebraska Medical Center said. [The doctor], who contracted Ebola in Africa, was the 3rd patient treated for the virus at the medical center in Omaha, but the only one to have died...

The surgeon was treating patients in Sierra Leone when he contracted the virus. He was not treating Ebola patients, and officials do not know how he contracted the deadly virus. He initially tested negative on 6 Nov 2014, but tested positive for the virus on 10 Nov 2014. He was flown from Sierra Leone and arrived in Nebraska on Sat [15 Nov 2014].

The biocontainment unit's director, Dr. Phil Smith, said S. was in "very critical condition" when he arrived. S. had no kidney function, had difficulty breathing, and was unresponsive at that time, said the hospital's chief of critical care, Dr. Dan Johnson. Doctors put him on dialysis, intubated him and put him on a mechanical ventilation device. They also gave him blood pressure medication, but he went into cardiac arrest.

Mapp Pharmaceutical, the company that makes ZMapp, provided the drug. The supply of the experimental drug had been exhausted months earlier. An unnamed Ebola survivor provided plasma...

[The doctor], 44, was a permanent resident in the U.S. and married to a U.S. citizen. He was a native of Sierra Leone.

It cost more than USD one million to treat 2 patients sent to the Nebraska Medical Center, a hospital official testified on Tues [18 Nov 2014], and it's still not clear who will pay the bill and how. It's the 1st on-the-record estimate of what it has cost to treat Ebola patients in the United States.

So far, 10 people have been treated on U.S. soil; most recently, [a doctor] who died Mon 17 Nov 2014]... - more

[3] UK: Royal family speaks out on Ebola & malaria

The Queen has asked "piercing" questions about how the disease ought to be controlled. She is worried that Ebola is overshadowing risks from diseases like malaria.

Ebola has claimed 5000 lives. Malaria kills the same number every week.

[Presumably, this means that any adult male who survived Ebola, even with a certificate showing his blood is negative for the virus, is now required to provide a semen sample on arrival, and if positive, will be quarantined until the test turns negative. - Mod.JW
