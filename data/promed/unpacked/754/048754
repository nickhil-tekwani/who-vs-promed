----------------------------------------------------------------------
There is another potential source not mentioned in the original reports for a large NICU sepsis outbreak of this type: the contamination of the glucose-containing intravenous (IV) fluids typically administered to neonates. Bacteria in the Klebsielleae tribe (_Klebsiella_, _Enterobacter_, _Serratia_) thrive when inoculated in glucose-containing IV fluids at room temperature, whereas other common bacterial pathogens do not survive or proliferate.

In settings with generally poor infection-control practices, widespread environmental sampling may yield overwhelming findings, but not necessarily helpful results to direct implementation of meaningful control strategies. When the pathogen is one of the 3 mentioned above, targeted testing of in-use IV fluids and careful observation of IV fluid handling practices may reveal contaminated fluids as the proximal source of neonatal sepsis; if so, focused strategies to minimize the risk of IV fluid contamination, in addition to improved hand hygiene and other basic infection control standards, can stop the outbreak.

I refer you to the report of an investigation led by US-CDC and hospital staff of a similar NICU outbreak of _Klebsiella_ sepsis, which contributed to a 50 percent mortality rate in a 25-bed NICU at a major teaching hospital in Cairo, Egypt in 2001. This outbreak resulted from bacteria introduced as a result of poor hand hygiene and propagated for months by routine cross-contamination of IV fluids and was successfully contained with strengthening of basic infection control combined with strategies targeted to IV fluid management.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Moore for the excellent suggestion that _Serratia marcescens_-contaminated IV solutions could be in part the cause of this large multi-institutional outbreak in Valencia, Venezuela.

ProMED-mail has posted previously on outbreaks due to _S. marcescens_-contaminated IV preparations. _Enterobacter agglomerans_ was the cause of the massive multi-institutional outbreak of sepsis related to contaminated IV fluids in the late 1970's,

and was the cause of an outbreak in neonates due to contaminated IV fluids
