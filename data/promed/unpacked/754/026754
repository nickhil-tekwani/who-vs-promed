Western Australia has been blighted with a spate of apparent sheep suicides, after a sizeable flocked grazed on a plant that proved to be both addictive and deadly. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, no less than 800 sheep are now known to have consumed the poisonous darling pea, with the plant having appeared across various pastures in the wake of heavy bushfires.

A leading veterinarian for the region likened the incident to a mass outbreak of class-A drug addiction. "It's like dealing with a thousand heroin addicts," said Bob McKinnon of North West Local Land Services, while speaking to the Herald. "They lose weight to start with and then get staggery, the progression gets worse, they get uncoordinated and depressed, they don't know where their feet are."

Many of the sheep tragically ended their own lives by repeatedly banging their heads into anything solid in the nearby vicinity, Mr McKinnon reported. Farmers and agricultural experts have since stepped up efforts to locate and destroy any remaining darling pea plants.

[Some species of _Swainsona_ plants are known to cause poisoning in livestock. 7 species of _Swainsona_ cause sporadic poisoning in livestock in inland areas south of the Tropic of Capricorn, in all Australian states. Some of these _Swainsona_ species are commonly known as 'darling pea' or 'poison pea'. In Central Australia, swainsona poisoning is caused by the plant _Swainsona canescens_. For simplicity, henceforth we will refer to _Swainsona canescens_ as swainsona.

Swainsona is a stout stemmed, erect plant, 30 or more cm (12 in or more) tall with numerous hairy leaflets, purple pea-shaped flowers and 10 cm (3.9 in) long woolly pods. This plant tends to grow from August to October in heavy sanded areas where seasonal flooding occurs, especially after winter rains. Swainsona may poison both cattle and horses and sheep. They are more likely to eat it when its growth is abundant while alternative feed is scarce. Horses especially selectively graze swainsona.

Swainsona poisoning is caused by swainsonine, an indolizidine alkaloid poison in the plant. Clinical signs of poisoning develop after ingestion of swainsonine, which acts in 2 ways:
- blocks the enzyme mannosidase, which causes the build up of abnormal complex sugars in body cells;
- interferes in the normal production of enzymes, hormones, and immunoglobulins.

The central nervous system is particularly sensitive to the toxic effects resulting from the build up of abnormal complex sugar. Depending on the animal species and the amount eaten, clinical signs of swainsona poisoning may become evident within 2 to 6 weeks and progress to a chronic or fatal stage after 8 weeks. The clinical signs of poisoning may first be noticed as loss of condition followed by nervous signs. This was demonstrated in feeding trials using cattle and horses at the Arid Zone Research Institute, Alice Springs in 1978.

After 4 weeks of ingestion, clinical signs of poisoning may be reversed if access to swainsona is prevented for a couple of months. This is consistent with a case reported in 1980 by a government veterinary officer, when a 1000 head of cattle were moved after grazing for 4 weeks in an area of swainsona growth and where no cattle died subsequently.

Although some clinical signs of poisoning may be reversed after 6 to 8 weeks of ingestion of swainsona, other neurological and behavioural changes may persist because of permanent cell damage. At this stage, the damage may result in a long-term reduction in fattening and breeding efficiency in cattle and a reduction in riding safety in horses. These same neurological and behavioural changes occur in sheep.

It seems that once animals get a taste of swainsona, they easily and quickly become "addicted" to it, preferentially consuming it over that of other foodstuffs.
