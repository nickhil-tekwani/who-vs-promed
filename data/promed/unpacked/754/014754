An increase in the number of measles cases has been reported from
Ukraine to the World Health Organization (WHO) since February 2005.
By the end of February 2006, 19 673 cases of measles had been
reported; 17 281 (88 percent) occurred during January and February
2006. [The text of the original report includes a histogram
illustrating the epicurve of measles in the Ukraine for 2005-2006,
showing a more than 10 000-fold increase in cases between Aug 2005
and Feb 2006].
While 7415 (38 percent) of the total cases have been reported from
Kyiv city (also known as Kiev) and Kyiv Oblast, where the outbreak
appears to have started, all 27 administrative territories of the
country are now reporting cases. All but 5 of these territories have
reported at least 100 cases each.
Based on more complete information received on 7136 cases reported up
to the end of January 2006, 6014 (84 percent) cases were in people
aged 15 years and older, 1110 (16 percent) were in adults aged 30 or
more years, and 493 (7 percent) were children aged under 5 years.
Of these 7136 cases, 3784 (53 percent) were reported as requiring
hospital admission, and at least 2 deaths are known to have occurred.
The age profile of 340 laboratory-confirmed cases reported during
2005 was similar to that of the cases reported up to January 2006.
Measles cases from the current outbreak in Ukraine have been imported
into Belarus (2 cases), the Russian Federation (9 cases), Spain (1
case) and the United States (2 cases). Measles virus of D6 genotype
has been identified from cases in Ukraine and from imported cases.
These D6 viruses have 99.7 percent sequence homology in the 450
nucleotides of the N gene based on data received from 2 of the 3 WHO
European regional measles and rubella reference laboratories and one
of the 3 WHO global specialised laboratories.
Vaccination status of patients
------------------------------
For 7136 cases for which detailed information is known, 1103 (15
percent) were identified as having received no measles vaccine, 1127
(16 percent) had received one dose, 2566 (36 percent) had received 2
doses, and the vaccination status of the remaining 2340 (33 percent)
cases is unknown.
Of cases in patients aged 15 years or older, 2916 (48 percent) had
received no doses or status was unknown, and 2144 (30 percent) had
received 2 doses. Among 268 cases in patients aged 1-4 years, 112 (42
percent) had received one dose of measles vaccine, 141 (53 percent)
had received no doses, and for 15 (6 percent) vaccination status was
unknown.
Measles vaccination schedule in Ukraine
---------------------------------------
Ukraine introduced measles vaccine in 1968 (using monovalent
Leningrad strain) and a 2-dose schedule for measles was introduced in
1986. 1st-dose measles vaccine coverage has been reported as higher
than 90 percent since 1992, but until 2000, coverage was based on the
proportion of children vaccinated among those due to be vaccinated
during a given year. Implementation rates by territory ranging from
below 20 percent to above 150 percent were due to frequent vaccine
shortages followed by catch-up activities when vaccine became
available. Mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccine was introduced in
2000 as a 2-dose programme at 12-15 months and 6 years; however,
monovalent measles vaccine continued to be used and coverage with MMR
vaccine was low until 2003.
The most recent measles outbreak in Ukraine before the current one
occurred during 2001-2002, when about 25 000 cases and 14 deaths were
reported. This outbreak affected western, southern and central
regions, but 1/3 of regions reported relatively few cases. Over half
the cases in this outbreak affected people aged 15 and over.
Discussion
----------
The reasons for the outbreak and the predominance of illness among
people aged 15 years and older are unclear, but it is consistent with
what has been observed in Belarus, Kazakhstan and the Russian
Federation, where a high proportion of measles cases are among
persons 20-30 years of age. This older age profile could be due to
lack of previous vaccination as a result of the extensive number of
contraindications accepted in the former Soviet Union; falsified
records; ineffective vaccine due to inadequate cold chain or poor
quality control during vaccine production; a duration of immunity
that is shorter than vaccines used in western Europe; or some other
factor.
A thorough epidemiological investigation is planned which may make
the reasons clearer. This investigation will also provide the
Ministry of Health with better information with which to plan an
appropriate response.
The WHO Regional Office for Europe (WHO EURO) has published a
strategic plan for the elimination of measles and rubella in the
European region [1,2]. New surveillance guidelines for measles,
rubella and congenital rubella infection will be published in 2006.
WHO EURO would like to be notified of measles cases in other
countries that may be linked to the current outbreak in Ukraine. The
European Regional Measles/Rubella Laboratory Network would also like
to receive specimens for virus detection/isolation or viral genetic
sequence data on cases linked to this outbreak. This information can
be communicated to Dr Mick Mulders at <mmu@euro.who.int>.

[Measles virus is a serologically nontypical virus. Neutralising
antibody elicited by the Edmonston vaccine strain is capable of
neutralising all strains of measles virus. Nonetheless some regions
of the measles virus genome (e.g. a 450 stretch of nucleotides in the
N gene) exhibit considerable genetic variability which is useful in
identifying and tracking the spread of measles virus strains.
Regions of the N gene may exhibit as much as 12 percent nucleotide
variability. For purposes of molecular epidemiology 8 clades of
measles virus strains have been defined (A to H), and within these
clades 22 distinct genotypes have been recognised (some of which
appear now to be extinct). Genotyping according to this scheme can be
employed to establish links between outbreaks and routes of
transmission of the virus. In the present instance the genotyping of
the outbreak virus as D6 type indicates that measles now cases
turning up in Belarus, the Russian Federation, Spain and the USA are
likely to be importations from the Ukraine. - Mod.CP]
