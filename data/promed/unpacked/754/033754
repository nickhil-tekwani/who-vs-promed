We have recently completed an analysis of trends in vibriosis incidence in the USA, as well as the possible contribution of ocean warming to the observed marked increase in risk. The analysis was undertaken using publicly available COVIS data assembled by the US CDC. Our paper has been submitted to a journal for publication, but is available as a preprint at https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/528893v1. We have attached the abstract below. We think this may be of interest to ProMED's readers.

Abstract:
Purpose: Epidemics of diarrhea caused by toxigenic strains of _Vibrio cholera_ are of global public health concern, but non-cholera _Vibrio_ (NCV) species are also important causes of disease. These pathogens are thermophilic, and climate change could increase the risk of NCV infection. The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a 'natural experiment' that may presage ocean warming effects on disease incidence.

Method: We obtained vibriosis case counts in the United States by digitizing annual reports from the U.S. Cholera and Other Vibrio Illness Surveillance system. Trends and environmental impacts (of ENSO and the North Atlantic Oscillation) were evaluated using negative binomial and distributed nonlinear lag models. Associations between latitude and changing risk were evaluated with meta-regression.

Results: Trend models demonstrated significant seasonality (P under 0.001) and a 7% annual increase in disease risk from 1999 to 2014 (annual IRR 1.071, 95% CI 1.061-1.081). Distributed lag models demonstrated increased vibriosis risk following ENSO conditions over the subsequent 12 months (integrated RR 1.940, 95% CI 1.298-2.901). The rate of change in vibriosis risk increased with state latitude (RR per 10o increase 1.066, 95% CI 1.027-1.107).

Conclusion: Vibriosis risk in the United States appears to be impacted by irregular large-scale ocean warming and exhibits a north-south gradient in rate of change as would be expected if changing disease incidence is attributable to ocean warming. Vulnerable populations, which include high-income countries with well-developed public health systems, may experience increased risk of this disease as a result of climate change.
