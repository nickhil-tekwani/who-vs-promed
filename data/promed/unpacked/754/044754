[Cases continue to occur associated with infection with WPV and cVDPVs. A worrisome issue is that the press is beginning to report there are more cases associated with the vaccine than there are associated with wild polioviruses. A very true observation, but it contributes to vaccine hesitancy on the part of the parents, especially in countries that no longer see cases of WPV-associated paralysis. The explanation for this occurrence is complex and difficult for many of the parents to understand. It seems an appropriate time to get the medical anthropologists involved.

With the multiple recurrent outbreaks, one can't help but wonder what proportion of these outbreaks can be attributed to the use of OPV2 [oral poliovirus type 2 vaccine] to interrupt transmission of the cVDPV2.

Polio HealthMap/ProMED-mail map links for posts:
For a map showing the locations of both WPV-associated cases and cVDPV-associated cases, see http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/.

As done in previous posts, to visualize all of this activity, I am putting links to HealthMap/ProMED-mail maps of countries with poliovirus activity during the past 12 months below. The size of the list remains impressive, now with 23 countries: 15 in Africa, 5 in Asia, and 3 in the Western Pacific, with either WPV or cVDPV isolates in their countries. An important reminder is that positive environmental samples means that the virus is circulating in the area where the samples have been obtained. Hence, if a susceptible individual is infected with the virus, there is a chance the person may develop paralytic disease.
