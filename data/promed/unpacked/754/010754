Denial of CCHF emergency in Kazakhstan
--------------------------------------
The Kazakhstan Ministry of Health has denied reports emanating from
Russian media sources concerning an emergency situation in Kazakhstan
due to an outbreak of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF). The
Russian press has reported that an emergency situation has been
declared following an outbreak of CCHF in Kazakhstan. The Ministry of
Health has denied that any emergency situation exists, but have
confirmed that that there are 2 new CCHF cases in South Kazakhstan.
Control measures to contain this infection are being implemented in the region.

A resident of Syrdarya village has been admitted to the Shardarinskiy
Regional infectious diseases Hospital. A 16-year-old girl from Jideli
village is suspected having contracted CCHF. In total 22 people have
contracted CCHF infection in Kazakhstan, including 8 cases with fatal
outcome. The Ministry of Health stated that facilities are in place
to deal with any further cases.

An official from the Ministry of Health announced that anti-tick
disinfestation measures were in progress in affected areas. Once
these have been completed the focus of the outbreak will have been
contained. Until this has been completed further cases may still
occur. A total of 224 million tenges (1 000 000 Kazakhstan tenges =
6633.50 US dollars) have been released for CCHF prevention, including
196 millions from the state reserves. 21 percent of cattle, which are
the main carriers of ticks, have received anti-tick treatment in
South Kazakhstan and the Kyzylordinskiy Oblast.

In total 87 people are currently in quarantine. The deputy chair of
the public health committee of the ministry of Health has stated that
more than 300 people went under medical observation because of
contacts with CCHF cases. All of them are receiving the necessary
care. He also affirmed, that despite the high interest of the Russian
media in this issue, there is no reason for panic, and outbreaks
such as occurred last July [2008] will not happen.
