USA: Suspected Norovirus Outbreak on Cruise Ship Out of New Orleans
------------------------------------------------
U.S. health officials launched an investigation on Thu 16 Oct 2003 into a
possible virus outbreak aboard a cruise ship after dozens of passengers
were taken ill. Carnival Cruise Lines said 97 of the 1650 passengers and
53 crew members on its ship Holiday had complained of nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhea during a 5-day trip from New Orleans to Carmen and Cozumel,
Mexico. "We're not sure at this point whether [the etiologic agent is a
norovirus]. We're still investigating that," said Vance Gulliksen,
spokesman for Carnival Cruise Lines, a unit of Carnival Corp. The ship had
been cleaned and would depart later on Thursday for a 4-day voyage to Cozumel.
Norovirus infection symptoms are usually serious only for the elderly and
very young, with most sufferers recovering within a few days. A
spokeswoman at the Centers for Disease Control said specimens were
collected from the ship, and tests to determine whether a norovirus was
present would be completed in about 10 days.
Another cruise ship, the Regal Princess, cut short a North Atlantic voyage
in August after 340 passengers and crew were affected by a norovirus
infection [see: Viral gastroenteritis update 2003 (21) 20030902.2206].

[The norovirus outbreaks that affected passengers and crew on cruise ships
in 2002 and to a lesser extent in 2003 appeared to have been contained by
greater awareness of the problem and the implementation of more effective
decontamination procedures. It is to be hoped that this outbreak does not
signal an increase in norovirus infection in the general population with
the ending of summer. - Mod.CP]
