A bat in Medford has tested positive for rabies, according to Jackson County Health and Human Services.

Officials are warning citizens to take precautions after a local resident was bitten by a bat on [16 Jul 2019] 16th. According to Jackson Baures, Jackson County Public Health Division Manager, the bat was inside of the resident's house.

"A person came home, and when they went into their house they found a bat flapping around on the ground. Apparently, the person had a dog, and they were trying to keep their dog away from the bat, and picked up the bat with their bare hand at the same time. And the bat bit them on their hand," said Jackson Baures, Jackson County Public Health Division Manager.

The bat was captured and sent to Oregon State University for testing. Results confirmed that the bat was positive for rabies. Baures said that rabies in bats is common, but handling bats with bare hands is not.

"Every year we have several reports of animal bites. It's not that common for people to pick up a bat with their bare hands and be bitten by it. That's why it's important for people to stay away from bats, don't handle bats. Bats are very important to the ecology. But they can also carry rabies, so don't handle bats or have contact with a bat," Baures said.

Limited information is available on the condition of the person who encountered the bat, however, Jackson County Health says they recommend rabies prophylaxis for the exposed individual.

Rabies is a viral disease affecting the central nervous system. It is transmitted from infected mammals to humans through the saliva -- typically by bite -- and is ultimately fatal once symptoms appear, according to the Mayo Clinic.

According to the Oregon Health Authority, bats are the most common carriers of rabies in the state. Approximately 8-10% of bats tested, test positive for rabies every year. Jackson County Health notes that the bats that are tested are usually found because they are sick. So far in 2019, 2 bats have tested positive for rabies in Oregon.

Despite its ability to infect all mammals, rabies virus persists in numerous species-specific cycles that rarely sustain transmission in alternative species. Rabies viruses recovered from bats were shown to be distinct from rabies viruses recovered from terrestrial mammals, suggesting that these viruses evolved within their bat hosts. Genetic evidence suggests that rabies is an old disease for bats in the New World. Bats from most of the bat species in North America, when sampled in sufficient numbers, have been found to be infected with rabies virus.

Bat rabies viruses of are genetically diverse, exhibiting mutations characteristic to each host bat species. It should be taken into account, however, that bat rabies can be transmitted to humans and their domestic animals, since infections are almost always fatal, unless treated. Also, a dog, cat, or ferret infected with a bat rabid virus can infect a human. - Mod.PMB
