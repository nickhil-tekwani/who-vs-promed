Avocado growers confirm presence of sunblotch
---------------------------------------------
Costa Rican avocado producers have expressed their dissatisfaction after the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG) announced that the country's plantations were free from the sunblotch virus, given how the State Phytosanitary Service (SFE) has shown to be inaccurate or incorrect from a technical standpoint over the last few years.

"It is unfortunate, there are expert plant pathologists who have verified the presence of the sunblotch disease in local Hass [variety] avocado plantations by sending samples to laboratories abroad," explained Randall Benavides, Chamber of Exporters and Importers of Perishables (CEIPP).

"In the interest of transparency, it would be advisable for these studies to be carried out again with the participation of all interested parties, to which end a request was issued last November [2015] to MAG, which was dismissed," stated Benavides.

The CEIPP believes that the samples should be sent to an independent laboratory in any country in order to make use of their experience in identifying such diseases.

[_Avocado sunblotch viroid_ (ASBVd; type member of genus _Avsunviroid_) affects avocado (_Persea americana_) and a few other members of the family _Lauraceae_. It causes one of the major diseases of the crop, with serious reductions of yield (up to 95 per cent losses), fruit quality and tree vigour. Symptoms may include yellowish, depressed streaks on young growth twigs and on fruits, which can look like they are sunburnt ('sunblotch'), as well as, occasionally, vein yellowing on leaves and bark cracking. However, symptoms may not be visible in some trees, but these still show significant yield reduction and act as pathogen reservoirs.

ASBVd is transmitted with infected budwood or rootstocks for grafting, by cutting tools, pollen (via pollinating bees) and with seed. Asymptomatic trees have an extremely high rate of seed transmission of up to 100 per cent, and the resultant infected seedlings are also asymptomatic. Disease management relies on the use of certified viroid free grafting material and seeds. Reliable diagnosis requires molecular techniques. Orchards should be tested every 3 years and pathogen reservoirs, with or without symptoms, must be removed.

In Costa Rica, ASBVd has been reported to be present before 2003, but it is not clear whether those records refer to commercial plantations. The viroid has been reported from most avocado-growing areas, including Mexico (where avocado is thought to have originated) and other countries in the Americas.

There appears to be an ongoing argument between countries in Central and South America about where ASBVd is present and what risk it poses to trade. However, this discussion is not really relevant, since even for countries were the viroid is already present, introduction of new strains or spread to new areas must be avoided. Since germinating seed of purchased avocado fruit is easy, for example for the home garden, and considering the extremely high rate of seed transmission of ASBVd, introduction of the viroid from an infected area by traded fruit would be almost a certainty over a period of time.

To protect national avocado industries, regular and reliable testing by molecular methods and certification of source orchards would be a minimum requirement to lower the risk of commercial trade of avocado fruit between countries.

The Hass avocado variety is available all year round and accounts for about 80 per cent of avocados eaten worldwide. It arose from a spontaneous mutation in a US garden in the 1920s and carried a patent until 1952.
