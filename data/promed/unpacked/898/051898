In the middle of an outbreak of toxoplasmosis, the obstetric center of the University Hospital of Santa María, the largest in the city, in the Central region of Rio Grande do Sul, has problems with overcrowding. The center has a capacity of 10 patients, but currently manages 26 hospitalized pregnant women.

According to the administration of the University Hospital of Santa María, this is one of the largest overloads of patients in the history of the hospital. The overcrowding of the center is due to pregnant women with a diagnosis of toxoplasmosis.

The hospital management filed a complaint to the health authorities alleging that the overcrowding of the obstetric center exposes the patients and puts at risk pregnant women and professionals.

The prefecture of the city of Santa María confirmed 51 cases of toxoplasmosis, 7 in pregnant women. However, a group of infectious disease physicians affirmed that they have confirmed 148 cases out of a total of 199 suspected cases.

The State Department of Health is investigating the death of a fetus that may have happened due to the disease.

[Infection with _Toxoplasma gondii_, the agent of toxoplasmosis, is endemic in Brazil. Outbreaks have been described, usually due to contamination of drinking water with surface water from lakes and rivers.

In the text above, the investigations behind the suspected diagnosis of toxoplasmosis are not described, and thus we can't be sure that the overcrowding of the obstetric ward at the Hospital of Santa María is due to toxoplasmosis. If it is, further investigation mapping the cases geographically in relation to the water supply in their homes is needed. ProMED-mail will be happy to post further information. - Mod.EP
