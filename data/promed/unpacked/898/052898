Plankton lesions mystify scientists
Great Lakes food chain affected
--------------------
Abnormal lesions are taking a toll on tiny crustaceans that are a key part
of the Great Lakes food chain, scientists said. The lesions can kill
zooplankton, which are up to one-eighth of an inch long and the primary food
source for young salmon, yellow perch, walleye and trout.
There is no evidence the phenomenon has adverse effects on humans. However
as plankton are primary food for fish, it is presently unknown how it could
affect the food chain. A National Oceanographic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) report called it "a serious, emerging threat to the
food web."
The outbreak of the lesions has quickly appeared, then disappeared, from
sampling locations across the 5 Great Lakes. During the summer a U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) research vessel, the 180-foot Lake
Guardian, will cruise the lakes collecting samples.
Researchers for 3 years have been tracking the spread of the lesions, first
discovered on Lake Michigan zooplankton. The cause has not been determined.
Researchers have found predatory species of zooplankton eating other animals
are more likely to have the growths than those eating vegetation. Lesions
are more common near the shore.
"On a human, it would look like a beach ball-sized hump growing out of their
body," said Tom Bridgeman, an aquatic biologist at the Lake Erie Center, a
research laboratory at Maumee Bay State Park near Toledo. "When you see it,
it's hard to imagine a plankton could even live with these things attached."
Researchers are unsure if the outbreak is a type of cancer, an unknown
infectious disease, a previously unseen parasite or a reaction to pollution.
Some scientists worry it could be a pest having migrated into the Great
Lakes in the ballast water of an oceangoing freighter, the route taken by
zebra mussels in the 1980s. Another theory holds the lesions could be
related to climate changes. In recent mild winters ice sheets have not
covered the lakes. Yet another theory is that the lesions may be caused by
extra sunlight streaming into lake water in recent years since zebra mussels
filtered and
clarified it. Before, the water was murky.
"There are plenty of theories, no answers," said Henry A. Vanderploeg, a
research ecologist at NOAA's Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory
in Ann Arbor, Mich. "We all see these tumor-like growths and lesions, but
nobody knows what's causing them. It's sort of a scientific nightmare."
Initially, the growths were found on plankton collected at a few sampling
sites in Lake Michigan. By last fall, their existence was confirmed in Lake
Erie and Lake Ontario.
