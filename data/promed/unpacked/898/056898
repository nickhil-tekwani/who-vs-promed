Gardendale police say they have euthanized around 10 wild animals over
the past few weeks that have been infected with distemper, all of them
raccoons except for one fox.

"I wish we didn't have to be involved with this, but, like many other
non-police related issues, there's no one else to do it locally," said
Gardendale Chief of Police Mike Walker. Walker said officers rarely
have trouble catching the animals because their illness is usually so
advanced that they are completely unaware of their surroundings. He
said they have lost their fear of humans and that they probably only
have a day or 2 left to live when they are caught and euthanized.

Distemper is an airborne virus that enters animals' upper respiratory
systems, according to Dr. Stephen Stewart, a veterinarian at Stewart
animal clinic in Warrior. He said the disease manifesting in foxes and
raccoons might indicate that it is canine distemper. He said humans
cannot contract distemper from an infected animal, but it is possible
for dogs to catch it if they come in direct contact with an infected
animal. In rare cases, pets can become infected if they wander into an
area where a wild animal with distemper was recently.

"It is a virus, so there's no real cure," said Stewart. "Supportive
care is one way to treat it. If you keep the animal strong and
stimulate its immune system, they can get over it." Stewart said
administering vitamin C to the animals had been a successful way to
help fight the disease. "It can be mild, and the dog might not be
obviously sick," he said. "If it gets bad enough, it can attack the
central nervous system and cause seizures and convulsions."

Stewart said limiting exposure to wildlife can help, but both he and
another veterinarian, Dr. Andrew Thompson of the Gardendale Pet
Clinic, said the best prevention is a vaccine. "I used to see a fair
amount of distemper, but not as much now," said Thompson. "The vaccine
is working really well." A vaccine at the Gardendale Pet Clinic costs
USD 18, and protects against other illnesses in addition to canine
distemper. Thompson said puppies are especially susceptible but that
adult dogs could become infected if they don't have immunity.

Chris Cook, a wildlife biologist with Alabama Wildlife and Freshwater
Fisheries, said distemper is a common problem, but it can have major
effects on wildlife. "Typically, it's just one or 2, but it can
sometimes kill quite a few," said Cook. "It can knock back a
population. It usually won't eradicate them, but it can take quite a
few out. ... But, populations usually rebound."

Cook said some studies show that as much as 60 percent of raccoon
deaths could be attributed to distemper. "The 1st thing people think
when they see an animal being lethargic or acting strange is that they
have rabies," he said. "Distemper is actually much more common."

Thompson said canine distemper can infect almost any canine, including
coyotes and wolves. He said cats have their own strain of distemper
and that they are not in danger of catching canine distemper.

[Distemper can mimic rabies in some species. Hopefully, some type of
diagnostic testing has been performed to verify that the disease is
indeed distemper.

Everyone should have their pets vaccinated against rabies, and dogs
should also be vaccinated against distemper. - Mod.TG]
