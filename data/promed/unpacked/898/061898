MELIOIDOSIS, TSUNAMI-RELATED (02): THAILAND, REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

In addition to the cases reported from Thailand by Dr. Wirongrong, I am
aware of 2 European tsunami victims from whom _Burkholderia pseudomallei_
has been isolated. One, who sustained extensive wounds in Phuket, grew _B.
pseudomallei_ as part of a mixed growth from a wound swab, but has no other
evidence of melioidosis. The other, who was exposed in Khao Lac, developed
respiratory insufficiency while being treated for soft tissue injuries, and
grew _B. pseudomallei_ from pleural fluid. I am also aware, through
informal networks, of a case in an Australian, who had a pure growth of _B.
pseudomallei_ from a leg wound sustained in Sri Lanka. Your earlier posting
(Disease surveillance, tsunami-related - Indonesia 20050125.0266) also
referred to 2 suspected cases of melioidosis hospitalized in Meulaboh.
Having seen video footage of the tsunami, it is clear that a great deal of
mud and soil was suspended in the water once it traveled any distance
inland, and so the occurrence of some cases of melioidosis in those who
aspirated this water, or whose wounds were contaminated by it, is not
surprising. However, the island of Phuket is not an area of high incidence
under normal circumstances, and only a handful of cases in the world
literature are known to have been acquired in many of the other areas
affected by the tsunami, such as Sri Lanka or Indonesia. It may be that
this episode will also point to areas where melioidosis is currently
under-recognized. Having a long standing interest in the epidemiology and
distribution of _B. pseudomallei_, I am intending to collate information
about tsunami-related cases of melioidosis and would be grateful if anyone
who is dealing with such cases would contact me.
