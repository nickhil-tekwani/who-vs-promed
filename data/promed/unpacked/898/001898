Ministry of Health's Efforts to Combat Spread of H1N1 Virus
-----------------------------------------------------------
During a meeting this Saturday morning [29 Dec 2012] with Dr. Hani Abdeen, the Minister of Health, Prime Minister Salam Fayad praised the extraordinary and professional efforts exerted by the Ministry of Health and its specialized staff to control and combat the spreading of the H1N1 virus, and commended the staff's accumulated experience in this regard.

The meeting was also attended by the Director General of Primary and General HealthCare, Dr. Asaad Al-Ramlawi, and several Ministry officials, who briefed the Prime Minister on the measures and procedures introduced by the Ministry since the recent outbreak of the virus. The Minister of Health presented the latest figures and information, which show that 187 cases have so far been recorded; the majority of which are in the northern West Bank, especially Jenin, as well as Ramallah, Bethlehem and southern Hebron. Minister Abdeen said the Ministry is working at full capacity to provide immediate treatment to all patients and pointed out that the Ministry's laboratory has the necessary medicines, testing kits and equipment to deal efficiently with the spread of the virus. The Minister also briefed Prime Minister Fayad on the number of recorded deaths, which stand at 9 until now.

Minister Abdeen clarified that the Ministry has doubled its efforts, in cooperation with the health institutions in the private and civil society sectors, including the provision of the necessary medicines and testing kits free of charge. The Ministry's laboratory, which is certified by the World Health Organization, conducts testing for the H1N1 virus exclusively and free of charge.

In this regard, Minister Abdeen also briefed the Prime Minister on the contacts initiated by the Ministry with the World Health Organization and neighboring countries in an effort to assist in treating the situation and controlling the spread of the virus. The Minister also affirmed that the Ministry of Health has begun a wide campaign in the local media to raise awareness about H1N1 [influenza virus], its symptoms, and measures to prevent contracting the virus [infection]. Dr. Abdeen also pointed out that the campaign will give special attention to those at higher risk, including children, the elderly, patients with chronic illnesses, and pregnant women, and stressing on the need to visit the nearest health center as soon as symptoms manifest in order to conduct the necessary tests that verify if the patient has contracted the H1N1 virus or not, and to provide the needed treatment.

Following the meeting, the Prime Minister addressed the media and stressed on the importance of maintaining calm and avoiding exaggeration while at the same time not underestimating the dangers of the virus spreading further. He called for vigilance and increased efforts as well as close coordination.

[The most recent WHO influenza global update (Influenza (112): WHO update 20121210.1445344) reported that: "Influenza activity has been noted in the North Africa and Eastern Mediterranean region at low levels. Algeria has reported some transmission of influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses. Bahrain has continued to report influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 detections in recent weeks. After previous influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus detections, Israel is now reporting mainly influenza A (H3N2) at low levels."

It is not clear from the Palestinian Authority statement whether the H1N1 virus responsible for the current influenza outbreak is the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic virus or another H1N1 virus, or whether other influenza viruses are circulating and have been detected. In addition information on the treatment offered and the vaccination status of the population would be welcomed. - Mod.CP
