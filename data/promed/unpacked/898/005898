There has been another case of anthrax reported in a herd of cattle.
The case, the 2nd in the RM of Fillmore, southeast of Regina, was
confirmed yesterday [2 Sep 2010], the 4th confirmed case this year [2010].

The 1st was confirmed on 6 Aug 2010 in the RM of Wellington,
southeast of Regina, and involved a herd of bison. The 2nd case,
confirmed in mid August 2010, was also in the RM of Fillmore and
involved a herd of cattle and a horse. On 22 Aug 2010, anthrax was
confirmed in a small herd of cattle in the RM of Garden River, north
of Prince Albert.

Findings of anthrax in Western Canada are not uncommon.

[These sporadic cases are to be expected in Saskatchewan because of
the enzootic risk. Fortunately, they appear to be limited in extent
this year [2010]. But it is these outbreaks that must be prevented by
vaccination. If you can prevent these, you prevent spread to
adjoining herds and ranches in epidemic years, and at the same time,
prevent the recontamination of soils, even on one ranch, giving
eventual significant control, even eradication, a chance.
