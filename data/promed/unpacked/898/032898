re: ProMED-mail Leptospirosis - Philippines: (MM,RI) 20091016.3561
------------------------------------------------------------------
A recent outbreak in Manila belies the fact that reported rates of
leptospirosis in the Philippines had actually decreased in recent years.
See graph at
<http://www.gideononline.com/blog/2009/10/17/leptospirosis-in-the-philippines/>.

The following additional background data are abstracted from Gideon
(<http://www.GideonOnline.com>). Primary references are available on request.

Leptospirosis was first reported in the Philippines in 1932.

- 65 cases were documented in literature published during 1932 to 1970; 390
during 1971 to 1973; about 840 during 1998 to 2001.
- leptospirosis is common in flood-prone areas of urban setting such as
Metro Manila.
- the average age of patients is 32 years, 87 per cent of cases were males
and 70 per cent are outdoor workers.
- the case fatality rate is 12 to 14 per cent.
- rates in Cabatuan, Iloilo are estimated at 147 cases per 100 000
population (2007 publication).

Prevalence surveys
------------------
5 per cent of aseptic meningitis cases in Manila (1989 publication).

Seroprevalence surveys
----------------------
43.6 per cent of rice farmers in Central Luzon (1988 publication).
0 per cent of dogs (RMAT [rapid microscopic agglutination], 1970 to 1973).

Infecting serovars
------------------
The following serovars of _Leptospira interrogans_ have been demonstrated
among patients in the Manila area: poi, tarassovi, manilai, pyrogenes,
australis, grippotyphosa, javanica, and automnalis.

Notable outbreaks
-----------------
1976 to 1983 -- an outbreak of leptospirosis was reported on a penal farm
in Sablayan, Mindoro.
1999 -- an outbreak (17 cases) of leptospirosis involved participants in an
"iron-man contest" -- from Germany, Hong Kong, and the Philippines.
