In the eastern Kavango region, 2 people have died from rabies over the past 2 months, prompting the Directorate of Veterinary Services (DVS) to embark on a vaccination campaign in the area. The cases were reported at the Nyangana District Hospital, with the incidents occurring at the Shambungu village, situated some 160 kilometres east of Rundu, the Namibia's Press Agency (Nampa) reported. The Nyangana District Hospital's Health Inspector, Getrude Mbambo, confirmed the cases, but could not provide details on the deceased as she is not allowed to release the particulars of patients.

The vaccination campaign will start in the Kavango East region on [2 Sep 2013] and will run for the whole week before it moves over to the Kavango West region. Rundu State veterinarian Dr Thompson Shuro also confirmed the rabies' cases to Nampa on Thursday [29 Aug 2013], saying the deaths occurred sometime between July and 13 Aug [2013]. "The DVS will run a vaccination campaign consisting of 4 teams, targeting over 31 communities in the eastern Kavango region," he explained. Dr Shuro cautioned dog owners whose dogs had not been vaccinated against the disease to bring them in so as to avoid further losses of lives.

Rabies is a deadly, infectious disease which attacks the central nervous system of animals and people. Its symptoms in dogs include salivating and a change in behaviour where the dog becomes aggressive, while in human beings [initial] symptoms include fatigue, anxiety and sweating.

[Earlier in the year [2013] (ProMED-mail post: Rabies, animal - Namibia 20130220.1552096) it was reported that human and animal rabies is increasing every year due to inadequate control measures. It was reported that a significant number of dogs have rabies, resulting in a high transmission rate of the disease to humans and wild animals. Most human and dog deaths due to rabies occurred in the northern communal area, especially the north-central regions. In response to this situation, it was proposed to establish a national rabies committee comprised of all relevant stakeholders. A more aggressive national rabies control strategy would be formulated and fully implemented to intensify public awareness of rabies. It was resolved that a strict, unified policy should be developed to control stray dogs, and an annual budget for rabies control activities would also be created. It is too early to judge whether this policy is being implemented and taking effect. - Mod.CP
