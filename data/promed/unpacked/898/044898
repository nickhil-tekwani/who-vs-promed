Farmers in [Naogaon] district [Rajshahi] are in difficulties. Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) sources said paddy was planted on 17 000 hectares [about 42 000 acres]. Of them, around 6 to 7 hectares [about 15-17 acres] are attacked by bacterial leaf blight (BAB).

The rice plants of those areas have turned dry and yellow and it is spreading from field to field. Farmers said their paddy fields are seriously affected.

[Bacterial leaf blight (BLB) of rice is caused by _Xanthomonas oryzae_ pv. _oryzae_. In Asia, millions of hectares of rice paddies are severely affected every year, with reported yield losses of up to 60 per cent. The pathogen causes yellowing and drying of leaves and wilting of seedlings. Blight lesions caused by severe strains elongate over the entire length of the flag leaf, giving a striped appearance. Severe strains may also affect panicles. Mild strains cause only small leaf lesions and may not lead to any detectable yield loss. Various saprophytic fungi may invade the lesions, contributing to the damage. Field patches infested with bacterial blight have a whitish, ragged appearance.

BLB is favoured by rain, high levels of fertilizer, high humidity, standing pools of water and warm temperatures. The bacterium is short-lived in soil and suspected to be seed borne but also to be short-lived in seeds. Grassy weeds, infected plant material (such as rice stubble or ratoons) and contaminated irrigation systems are thought to be the primary pathogen reservoirs. The disease spreads by windblown rain and mechanical means (for example when transplanting seedlings or by high insect activity).

Disease management usually includes phytosanitation (control of weed and volunteer rice reservoir hosts, removal of contaminated materials), cultural measures (optimal plant spacing and fertilizers) and use of resistant crop varieties. Control of insect populations by insecticides may help reduce the unspecific spread of bacteria via their scratching and sucking wounds. Antibacterial sprays containing antibiotics are rarely used because they often provide little benefit, and agricultural application of antibiotics is strictly regulated in most countries.

The related _X. oryzae_ pv. _oryzicola_ causes bacterial leaf streak of rice.
