ANTHRAX VACCINE PRODUCTION TO END - MICHIGAN, USA (02)

Anthrax vaccine production to end - Michigan, USA 970721165607]
The sale of the Michigan Biologic Products Institute will bring a shortage
of more than anthrax vaccine. This agency is one of only two remaining
manufacturers of intramuscular immune globulin (IG) in the USA. As
recent experience with the widespread exposures last spring to
contaminated strawberries demonstrated, there is still a need for IG as a
post-exposure prophylaxis for hepatitis A infection; the only other
approved use for IG is for post-exposure measles prophylaxis in infants
under 12 months. As for Hepatitis A pre-exposure, we now have two
vaccines licensed in the USA, so using IG for that purpose is to be
discouraged.
Would someone from Michigan give us more information about the other
biologics produced, and what impact on the market is to be expected
during the transition to the new owner?
