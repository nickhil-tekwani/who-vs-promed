Asian soybean rust has never been identified in an Iowa field since
the disease was reported in the continental United States in November
2004. However, the disease now has been conclusively identified on
soybean plant tissue submitted to the Iowa Soybean Rust Team last week.
This soybean residue is reported to have been recovered from a bin of
soybeans produced in Iowa [in the midwestern United States] in 2006.
Efforts are underway to identify other remnant plant residue that may
show symptoms and signs of the disease in order to figure out the
details of this event. The fungus and the spores that cause the
disease cannot survive without green leaf tissue and will die during
Iowa winters. The recently discovered rust fungus does not pose a
risk of infection for the 2007-growing season in Iowa.
"The fast, conclusive identification of soybean rust in this one
particular plant residue sample illustrates the rapid diagnostic
capabilities available at Iowa State University (ISU) to protect the
state's soybean crop from the threat of this disease," says Wendy
Wintersteen, dean of ISU's College of Agriculture.
"This discovery reminds us that it is possible for Iowa fields to
become infected with this disease," says David Wright, director of
contract research at the Iowa Soybean Association. "Nonetheless,
growers should not overreact to this development. Instead, growers
must be ready to act appropriately and economically in 2007, should
this disease show up again in Iowa and be a threat to soybean yields."
Bill Northey, Iowa Secretary of Agriculture, says the finding does
not necessarily increase the risk for the 2007 crop. "The
confirmation of this disease in the 2006 crop does not guarantee that
we will have Asian soybean rust in the 2007 Iowa soybean crop," he points out.
"As in previous years, farmers should monitor the growing conditions
and weather conditions that favor the development of rust and consult
with ISU Extension specialists on identification and management
plans. However, it is imperative for farmers to avoid the inclination
to panic and take drastic, costly, and unnecessary action before
positively identifying soybean rust in their fields."
The Iowa Soybean Rust Team is made up of specialists from ISU's
College of Agriculture and ISU Extension, the Iowa Soybean
Association, the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship
and USDA's (United States Department of Agriculture) Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service.
The Iowa Rust Team recruited and trained more than 600 agribusiness
professionals from 2004 to 2006 to serve as "First Detectors." These
people can examine leaf samples and decide whether the samples
warrant further investigation for possible infection with soybean
rust by ISU Extension personnel in the state or by campus-based ISU scientists.
Growers are encouraged to consult --free of charge-- with Iowa
Soybean Rust Team First Detectors in the 2007-growing season if they
observe plants that they suspect might have soybean rust. The names
and contact information for First Detectors is available at
<http://www.plantpath.iastate.edu/soybeanrust/> and at county
Extension offices.

in 231 different counties in 15 states: AL, AR, FL, GA, IL, IN, KY,
LA, MO, MS, NC, SC, TN, TX, and VA. Including reports on kudzu, there
is a total of 274 counties in 15 states with rust this year including

17 in Georgia; 7 in Texas; 5 in Missouri; 9 in Mississippi; 42 in
North Carolina; 18 in Kentucky and Virginia, 8 in Illinois; 6 in

[Here is what our plant moderator said in his comment on soybean rust
in October 2006:
"Asian soybean rust (ASR) is a plant disease caused by the fungus
_Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ and was introduced into the USA in 2004. In
addition to the crop plant soybean (_Glycine max_), cowpeas, green
beans, and other edible legumes could be affected by the ASR pathogen
which causes defoliation and yield reduction. Kudzu (_Pueraria
lobata_, a.k.a. Japanese
arrowroot) is an important alternate host for the pathogen in
southern states of the USA. - Mod.JAD"]
