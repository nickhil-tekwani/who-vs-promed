External situation report 06
----------------------------
WHO continues to support the Ministry of Public Health and other national authorities in Madagascar to monitor and respond to the outbreak of plague. The number of new cases of pulmonary plague has continued to decline in all active areas across the country. In the past 2 weeks, 12 previously affected districts reported no new confirmed or probable cases of pulmonary plague. From 1 Aug 2017 to 24 Oct 2017, a total of 1309 suspected cases of plague, including 93 deaths (7 percent), were reported. The figures in this report are based on a rigorous data cleaning, verification and analysis process aimed to give a better understanding of the dynamics of the epidemic. Of these, 882 (67 percent) were clinically classified as pulmonary plague, 221 (17 percent) were bubonic plague, 1 was septicemic, and 186 were unspecified (further classification of cases is in process). Since the beginning of the outbreak, 71 healthcare workers (with no deaths) have been affected.

Of the 882 clinical cases of pneumonic plague, 235 (27 percent) were confirmed, 300 (34 percent) were probable and 347 (39 percent) remain suspected (additional laboratory results are in process). 14 strains of Yersinia pestis have been isolated and were sensitive to antimicrobials recommended by the National Program for the Control of Plague.

Between 1 Aug 2017 and 24 Oct 2017, 29 districts have reported confirmed and probable cases of pulmonary plague. The number of districts that reported confirmed and probable cases of pulmonary plague during the last 2 weeks reduced to 17. About 70 percent (3467) of 4990 contacts identified have completed their 7-day follow-up and a course of prophylactic antibiotics. A total of 7 contacts developed symptoms and became suspected cases. On 24 Oct 2017, 1165 out of 1239 (94 percent) contacts were followed up and provided with prophylactic antimicrobials.

Plague is endemic on the Plateaux of Madagascar, including Ankazobe district, where the current outbreak originated. A seasonal upsurge, predominantly of the bubonic form, usually occurs yearly between September and April. In 2017, the plague season began earlier and the current outbreak is predominantly pneumonic and is affecting both endemic and non-endemic areas, including major urban centres such as Antananarivo (the capital city) and Toamasina (the port city).

[The overall numbers of cases and deaths, as noted in this report, have been lessened based on "a rigorous data cleaning, verification and analysis process aimed to give a better understanding of the dynamics of the epidemic" although the Outbreak News report from 30 Oct 2017 gives higher numbers from perhaps a different source. There have been moderate discordance in numbers from Madagascar and WHO sources previously.

Discordance in overall numbers makes interpretation of number of new cases difficult. It does seem to appear that a downswing in the outbreak may be occurring. Overall, however, the low case fatality rate seems inconsistent with the number of cases of pneumonic plague. - Mod.LL]

While plague cases continue to be reported in Madagascar, health officials say the situation is improving as evidenced by 16 previously affected districts reported no new confirmed or probable cases of pulmonary plague during the past 2 weeks, which is creating some optimism.

"This is the beginning of the end of the epidemic if we maintain vigilance," said Dr Mahery Ratsitorahana, Director of Health Surveillance and Epidemiological Surveillance (DVSSE) within the Ministry of Public Health, during a press conference, according to L'Express de Madagascar report.

The WHO said something similar in a report today, 30 Oct 2017:
"While progress has been made in response to the plague outbreak in Madagascar, sustainability of ongoing operations (during the outbreak and through the plague season usually from September to April) remains critical. Funds for operations are running low, given the fact that only 26 percent of the multisector response plan has been funded. Additional response logistics such as temperature monitoring equipment (infrared thermometers), rapid diagnostic tests, personal protective equipment, infection prevention and control supplies, and medicines (antibiotics) need to be provided. Efforts to strengthen outbreak control measures should continue."

From 1 Aug 2017 to 27 Oct 2017, a total of 1554 suspected cases of plague, including 113 deaths (case fatality rate 7 percent), were reported. Of these, 985 (63 percent) were clinically classified as pulmonary plague, 230 (15 percent) were bubonic plague, 1 was septicemic, and 338 were unspecified (further classification of cases is in process). Since the beginning of the outbreak, 71 healthcare workers (with no deaths) have been affected.

[3] South African case NOT imported

The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) has confirmed that a South African man who visited Madagascar contracted a plague formerly known as black death, but he has been successfully treated and is now back home. The plague has only been detected in Madagascar with 93 deaths reported since August 2017.

The NICD's Lucille Blumberg says that the man was treated in hospital in Madagascar earlier in October 2017 after he was in contact with a man who died from the plague. He was put on antimicrobials for a week, which Blumberg says were extremely effective.

"He is in good health and there's absolutely no risk. We need to be vigilant, the risks are low. But it is absolutely necessary that we have systems in place."

Blumberg says that the man has tested negative after numerous follow-up tests.

[It is now clear that the South African case was not imported from Madagascar but rather diagnosed and treated in Madagascar proper. At this point, there are no documented _Y. pestis_ cases exported outside of Madagascar. - Mod.LL]

[4] ECDC guidelines regarding ships and aircraft

Guidance for the management of suspected bubonic plague cases identified on aircraft and ships
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Key messages:
- The common route of transmission of bubonic plague to humans is the bite of an infected flea. The disease can be transmitted between humans by contact with infected bodily fluids; humans can be also infected by touching or skinning infected animals.
- The infection can cause a severe disease in humans but can be successfully treated with early administration of antimicrobials. If bubonic form is not treated, the infection can spread through the bloodstream to the lungs, resulting in pneumonic or septicemic form of plague.
- A case of bubonic plague can be suspected on aircraft or ships when a passenger or a crew member leaving an affected area has a fever associated with swollen lymph nodes.
- The presence of trained crew members and their awareness of the disease could help reduce the risk of onboard transmission.
- The main risk of transmission on aircraft and ships lies in infected fleas infesting a passenger and/or his/her belongings. The transmission by bodily fluids (such as the fluid from the buboes) requires exposure to infected material through a break in the skin; this can be considered unlikely on aircraft and ships, but it cannot be excluded.
- Members of the cabin crew assisting an ill passenger should wear gloves; the ill passenger and the crew member assisting him/her should follow standard infection control precautions.
- Local authorities at the arrival airport/mooring port of call should be informed immediately after the identification of a suspected case of bubonic plague on board so they can plan mitigation measures aimed at reducing the risk of further spread.
- If there is a suspected plague case on board, passengers should be informed about how to self-monitor for plague-compatible symptoms; the collection of passenger contact details is crucial for further contact tracing.
- Physicians should consider early post-exposure prophylaxis for passengers and crew members who have come in direct contact with body fluids of the ill passenger.
- Arrangements for post-event disinfection and disinsection procedures for the aircraft and the ill passenger's belongings should be considered after disembarking.
- On a ship, the WHO's International medical guide for ships suggests that the patient's quarters and all other passenger quarters should be treated with insecticide powder in order to ensure the extermination of fleas.
- After disembarking from a ship, the sickbay and/or the cabin where the ill passenger was isolated should be disinfected and disinsected. All biohazard materials should be disposed of properly and in accordance with the relevant national and international rules and recommendations.
