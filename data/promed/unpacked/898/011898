The French health authorities have reported a fatal case of yellow fever in
French Guiana. The patient was a 30 year old woman who lived in Aloike on
the Maroni River, Saint-Laurent-du-Moroni region. Confirmation was made by
the Institut Pasteur of Guiana on 7 May. The viral strain, identified by
PCR [polymerase chain reaction], appears to be close to yellow fever virus
strains circulating in Latin America (Brazil, Peru).
Isolation [of the virus] has not been possible. The vaccination status of
the case is not known. Control measures are being strengthened and a
vaccination campaign for the population at risk is being carried out by the
health authorities of French Guiana. Travellers to French Guiana are
reminded that yellow fever vaccination is an entry requirement.

[French Guiana, capital Cayenne, is located on the northeast coast of South
America. A large part of it is covered in rain forest, and forms part of
the yellow fever endemic zone of South America. We received a rumor a few
days ago about this case, but were unable to confirm it until this notice
from the World Health Organization. It is regrettable that a case confirmed
on 7 May was not officially published until 18 days later. Under the
International Health Regulations it should have been notified to WHO within
24 hours - Mod.JW]
