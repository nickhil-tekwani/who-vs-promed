Outbreaks Following Wild Poliovirus Importations --- Europe, Africa,
and Asia, January 2009-September 2010
----------------------------------
The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) began in 1988. By
2006, indigenous transmission of wild poliovirus (WPV) had been
interrupted in all but 4 countries (Afghanistan, India, Nigeria, and
Pakistan) (1). However, outbreaks following WPV importations into
previously polio-free countries remain an ongoing risk until polio is
eradicated (1--3). The GPEI Strategic Plan for 2010--2012 (4) set the
following 2 goals for outbreak control: 1) end outbreaks occurring in
2009 by mid-2010 and 2) end outbreaks occurring during 2010 to
mid-2012 within 6 months of confirmation. This report describes new
outbreaks that have occurred in the World Health Organization (WHO)
European Region and updates previous reports on the status of
outbreaks in Africa and Asia (3).

In 2010, the 1st WPV importation into the European Region since the
region was declared polio-free in 2002 resulted in 476 confirmed
cases: 458 in Tajikistan, 14 in Russia, 3 in Turkmenistan, and one in
Kazakhstan. In Africa and Asia, 11 new importations into 6 countries
were observed in 2010; 30 WPV importations that occurred during
2008--2009 resulted in 215 cases in 15 African countries during
2009--2010. An outbreak is considered interrupted if 6 months have
elapsed since the latest confirmed case and surveillance performance
indicators meet WHO standards. All 2009 outbreaks in Africa appear to
have been interrupted, and 2010 outbreaks in 3 countries appear to
have been interrupted. Maintaining high routine vaccination coverage
and sensitive surveillance at all times and rapidly instituting
additional immunization programs to control outbreaks are key to
limiting and stopping the spread of WPV.

European Region Importations, 2010
On [13 Apr 2010], Tajikistan notified WHO of a sharp increase in
reported acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases. On [20 Apr 2010], the
designated WHO regional reference laboratory in Moscow, Russia,
identified WPV type 1 (WPV1) in stool specimens from persons with AFP
cases; the WPV1 was genetically most closely related to WPV1 isolated
in Uttar Pradesh, India, in August 2009. As of [1 Nov 2010],
Tajikistan had reported 458 laboratory-confirmed WPV1 cases from 35
of 61 administrative territories, with paralysis onset dates
occurring [1 Feb--4 Jul 2010] (Figure 1 [available at above given URL
link). 90 (20 percent) patients were aged less than 1 year, 208 (45
percent) were aged 1--4 years, 107 (23 percent) were aged 5--14
years, and 53 (12 percent) were aged greater than or equal to 15
years. Early in the outbreak, the majority of cases were in children
aged less than 5 years; after week 20, 78 percent of cases were in
persons aged greater than or equal to 5 years (Figure 1). 26 (5.7
percent) patients died; 15 were aged less than 5 years, 8 were aged
5--14 years, and 3 were aged greater than or equal to 15 years.

The outbreak spread to 3 other polio-free countries,* where 18 cases
were confirmed, bringing to 476 the total number of cases in the
European Region (Figure 2 [available at above given URL link). Russia
reported 14 cases following at least 5 independent importations, with
onsets during [4 May 4--25 Sep 2010] (confirmed [31 May 2010]).
Turkmenistan reported 3 cases in June (confirmed [27 Jun 2010]), and
Kazakhstan reported one case in August (confirmed [5 Oct 2010])
(Table 1 see table excerpt below). Nine of these 18 patients were
aged less than 5 years.

Efforts to control the outbreak in Tajikistan began [4 May 2010] with
the 1st of 4 rounds of national supplementary immunization activities
(SIAs),***** 2 weeks apart, using monovalent type 1 oral poliovirus
vaccine (mOPV1) (Table 2 [available at above given URL link]). The
1st 2 SIAs targeted children aged less than 6 years, and the 3rd and
4th SIAs targeted children aged less than 15 years. Mop-up SIAs with
mOPV1 were conducted in 34 districts in September [2010]; one
national SIA using trivalent OPV was conducted in early October
[2010], and another is planned for November [2010], each targeting
children aged less than 15 years (Table 2). Reported vaccination
coverage for each SIA was greater than or equal to 98 percent of the
target (Table 2 [available at above given URL link]).

In early May 2010, the risk for importation was assessed for 12
countries*** in the European Region to identify high-risk subnational
areas for WPV transmission. National authorities were advised to
strengthen surveillance**** through enhanced active case finding and
weekly reporting and to implement SIAs as needed. Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan conducted national SIAs to
limit further spread; Russia conducted focal mop-up SIAs and catch-up
immunizations (Table 2).

Importations in Africa and Asia, 2009--2010
19 importations of WPV1 and 11 of WPV type 3 (WPV3) that occurred
during 2008--2009 (9 in 2008 and 21 in 2009) resulted in 208 polio
cases in 15 countries in 2009 and 7 additional cases in 2010 (Table 1
[see excerpted Table 1 below). As of [1 Nov 2010], no other 2009
outbreak-related cases had been detected during the 6 months since
the latest case in Mauritania ([28 Apr 2010]). In outbreaks with the
1st case occurring in 2010, 7 importations of WPV1 and 2 of WPV3
resulted in 26 polio cases in 4 African countries, and WPV1
importation into one Asian country resulted in 6 cases to date (Table
1 [see excerpted Table 1 below]).

West Central Africa.** In 2009, outbreaks related to increased
circulation of WPV1 and WPV3 in Nigeria during 2008--2009 occurred in
12 countries****** (Table 1). Outbreaks in Mali, Mauritania, and
Sierra Leone continued into 2010.

In 2010, Senegal had 3 importations (1st confirmed [18 Jan 2010]).
New importations with no or limited subsequent transmission also
occurred in Liberia (confirmed [14 Apr 2010), Mali (WPV1 confirmed [8
Apr 2010] and WPV3 confirmed [15 Oct 2010]) and Niger (confirmed [22
Apr 2010]) (Table 1). The most recent case among 2010 outbreaks
occurred on [8 Sep 2010] in Liberia.

Horn of Africa. Outbreaks occurred in Kenya and Uganda in 2009 (the
latest cases on [30 Jul 2010 and 10 May 2009], respectively) (Table
1). These represented 2 distinct importations from south Sudan, where
WPV1 genetically related to viruses from the importation-related
outbreak during 2004--2005 in Sudan was again confirmed from polio
cases during June 2008--June 2009.******* A new 2010 importation case
occurred in Uganda on [28 Sep 2010] (confirmed [18 Oct 2010]),
genetically related to virus last isolated in Kenya in 2009.

South Central Africa. Two cases occurred in Burundi in 2009, most
recently on [12 Sep 2009] (Table 1). This outbreak spread from the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) as a result of WPV1
importation from India into Angola in 2005 and subsequently into DRC (3).

Nepal. Two WPV1 importations from India caused 6 confirmed WPV1 cases
in Nepal in 2010. The 1st case occurred on [19 Feb 2010] (confirmed
on [19 Mar 2010]), and the most recent occurred on [30 Aug 2010].

MMWR Editorial Note
-------------------
The large 2010 WPV1 outbreak in the WHO European Region, certified as
polio-free since 2002, highlights the risk for WPV reintroduction for
all countries posed by international travel and migration. Factors
contributing to the scale of the outbreak in Tajikistan included a
health system with limited resources, accumulation of susceptible
persons in areas of low OPV coverage (5), and delays in recognizing
and testing the initial cluster of AFP cases, as also occurred during
the 2005 outbreak in Yemen (2). In June 2009, the European Regional
Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication
highlighted a high risk for transmission in Tajikistan if WPV was
introduced (6), but funds were not available to conduct preventive
SIAs. Additional SIAs are planned in the Central Asian republics and
Russia to end the outbreaks and prevent spread to other countries in
the region known to have pockets of low vaccination coverage (e.g.,
Bulgaria, Georgia, and Ukraine). All countries in the region must
ensure full political commitment to undertake the actions recommended
by WHO to detect WPV importations and limit spread.

The GPEI Strategic Plan milestone of ending 2009 importation-related
outbreaks by mid-2010 appears to have been met, with one possible
exception: WPV1 circulation related to the 2009 outbreak in Kenya, as
suggested by the [18 Sep 2010] case in Uganda. Whether WPV1
circulating in Kenya in 2009 continued to circulate without detection
in Uganda, in Kenya, or in both countries is uncertain and requires
further observation and investigation. Many outbreaks occurring in
2010 have ended or are on track to end within 6 months of
confirmation, including the outbreak in Tajikistan. However, concern
exists that ongoing transmission within the northern Caucasus area of
Russia and in Nepal could spread further, unless high-quality SIAs
are implemented. In Africa, some countries that had outbreaks have
not met AFP surveillance performance criteria fully, so caution is
needed when interpreting the length of time after the latest
confirmed cases as a sign that an outbreak has ended, particularly
when surveillance is suboptimal in neighboring countries.

During 2009--2010, WPV was imported into polio-free countries from
both polio-endemic countries (India and Nigeria) and previously
polio-free countries with reestablished transmission (Chad and Sudan)
(3), with importations occurring more frequently in countries
adjacent to countries with ongoing WPV transmission. The risk for WPV
importations in 2010 appears to have decreased as a result of 1) a
greater than or equal to 90 percent decrease in confirmed cases in
Nigeria and northern India compared with the same period in 2009, 2)
a prolonged period without confirmed WPV cases in Sudan, and 3)
greater than 4 months without confirmed cases in Chad. However, WPV
importations from reservoir countries into polio-free areas will
continue to occur until transmission is interrupted everywhere.

Transmission after WPV importation can be prevented by ensuring high
levels of poliovirus immunity in the population. Early recognition
and response to WPV transmission limit the geographic extent and
enable more rapid control of an outbreak (8,9). All polio-free
countries are advised to maintain high levels of immunity against
polioviruses at all times through strong routine vaccination
programs, adding SIAs when necessary. Maintaining sensitive,
efficient, nationwide AFP surveillance systems with timely
investigation and testing of specimens in accredited laboratories is
critical to promptly identifying importations. National authorities
should maintain updated preparedness plans for timely, large-scale,
high-quality response SIAs if WPV importations occur (9).

[The above report is an excellent review of the current challenges
posed by reintroduction of WPV into countries that had interrupted
transmission of the WPV. The report does demonstrate the challenges
countries face in maintaining high coverages with 3 or more doses of
OPV after they have interrupted transmission of the WPV.

Another challenge confronting the surveillance efforts once
transmission of the WPV has been interrupted in a country is
identifying newly introduced cases when clinicians in the country
automatically assume that these can't be polio. When the polio
eradication efforts 1st began in the Americas region in 1985, Brazil
had had 5 years of intensive polio control activities (since 1980)
ongoing that included the use of national immunization days (NIDs).
As a result of those activities, reported high coverages of the
population with OPV and the marked reduction in paralytic cases,
clinicians often did not entertain the diagnosis of polio when seeing
cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP). The result of this was that a
large outbreak of polio that was ongoing in the northeastern states
of the country had been "missed" through routine surveillance
activities, and was identified later in the course of the outbreak
than would have occurred before the NIDs had begun. The outbreak in
Tajikistan was very reminiscent of this, and one suspects that
similar events were ongoing within the country, where clinicians saw
cases of AFP, and assumed they couldn't be due to WPV infection,
since it had been years since WPV had circulated in the country, and
NIDs had "eliminated" the problem of large groups of susceptibles.
