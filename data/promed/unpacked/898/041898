One more Ebola case has been confirmed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Equateur province outbreak, raising the total to 68 cases, the World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office said today [29 Jul 2020] on Twitter.

The patient is apparently from Mbandaka, the provincial capital, which is a concern, given its travel connections to Kinshasa and neighboring countries. The number of deaths held steady at 31.

The outbreak has been under way since early June [2020], and the continued increase in cases is a grave concern, given the rising incidence and geographic spread, the WHO's regional office said yesterday [28 Jul 2020] in its weekly outbreaks and health emergencies update.

The event is complicated by COVID-19, measles outbreaks, and other challenges, as well as confirmed cases that remain in the community or are lost to follow-up. 3 healthcare workers are among the confirmed cases.

In other Ebola developments, the US Biodefense Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Department of Health and Human Services, has signed an agreement with Regeneron to buy supplies of its Ebola triple antibody cocktail, REGN-EB3, as part of building national preparedness, the company said today in a press release. The drug is currently under priority review by the Food and Drug Administration.

The company said it expects to deliver an established number of treatment doses over a 6-year period and receive about USD 10 million in 2021 and USD 67 million per year for each of the next 5 years.

REGN-EB3 is one of 2 drugs that stood out as more effective than other options in studies conducted in the DRC.

[The prior report, CIDRAP 27 Jul 2020, reported 2 more cases from Mbandaka, the provincial capital, bringing the total number to 67 (63 confirmed, 4 probable) with 31 deaths and 21 recovered before this latest report of 1 additional case, raising the total to 68. The community deaths, as discussed below, are the greatest concern, particularly because the burials are unlikely to be safe. - Mod.LK]

Week 30: 20-26 Jul 2020; data as reported by: 26 Jul 2020
Ebola virus disease Democratic Republic of the Congo (Equateur Province) CFR 46.3%
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Event description
The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Equateur Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo, is escalating further, with 23 health areas in 7 health zones affected. Since our last report (weekly bulletin 29), another 9 additional confirmed EVD cases have been reported, with 9 new deaths, one of which was is a man who had returned 2 negative PCR results before dying of complications of EVD. One new confirmed case was reported on 25 Jul 2020, the wife of a man who had died of the disease on 22 Jul 2020. Their child had also been reported as a confirmed case. The patient was a known contact who had been vaccinated and was monitored regularly.

As of 25 Jul 2020, there are a total of 67 [now 68] cases (63 confirmed and 4 probable) including 31 deaths (case fatality ratio 46.3%). The case fatality ratio among confirmed cases is 42.9% (27 deaths/63 confirmed cases). 3 health workers are among the confirmed cases, making up 4.5% of all cases. The number of health areas that have reported at least 1 confirmed or probable case of EVD since the start of this outbreak has risen to 23, in 7 of the 18 health zones in the province. In the past 21 days (5-25 Jul 2020), 25 confirmed cases have been reported in 13 health areas across 5 health zones. However, Iboko Health Zone has gone 21 days without a confirmed case of EVD, with the last confirmed case reported on 4 Jul 2020.

Out of the 6 health zones, 5 reported contacts on 25 Jul 2020. Of the 914 new contacts reported, 354 (58.4%) were reported from Bikoro. Out of 5360 active contacts, 4242 (79.1%) had been seen in the previous 24 hours. Of the 531 contacts who were not seen in this 24-hour period, 161 (30.3%) have never been seen, 25 (4.7%) were lost to follow-up and 345 (65%) had not been seen in the previous 24 hours. In addition, 13 contacts have become symptomatic, including 10 in Bikoro, 2 in Mbandaka and 1 in Bikoro. Seven health zones reported alert data on 16 Jul 2020, with 501 new alerts reported, including 4 deaths. A total of 1015 alerts were reported, of which 441 (43.4%) were investigated. Of these, 79 (17.9%) were validated as suspected cases and 26 (32.9%) were investigated. For the 3rd consecutive day, the number of alerts investigated remained low in Mbandaka at 10.5%, suggesting that more investigators are needed in this health zone.

Situation interpretation
The EVD outbreak in Equateur Province is escalating, with increasing new confirmed cases along with geographical spread to new health areas. Community resistance to response activities is being seen and there are challenges around inadequate resources for alert investigations in Mbandaka, and in case management in rural and hard-to-reach areas. The constant presence of confirmed cases in the community is of particular concern, along with suspected cases who are not isolated. Although all pillars of response are active in the affected areas, further actions are required to limit spread to other areas, along with intense community engagement with community leaders to prevent resistance to response activities and ensure that communities become fully engaged in response activities.

[2] Long-term persistence of Ebola-specific immune activity
Date: Mon 27 Jul 2020
Source: News Medical Life Sciences, French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD) report [edited]
https://www.news-medical.net/news/20200727/Ebola-survivors-have-long-lasting-severe-immune-dysfunction.aspx


In the 2013-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, more than 28 000 people were infected, causing over 11 000 deaths. While the long-term health impacts on survivors are still poorly understood, an increasing number of studies describe persistent clinical after-effects in these patients, such as generalized fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and eye disorders.

To pinpoint these health problems, the research teams used data from the follow-up of cohorts of survivors, such as the Inserm PostEboGui cohort, developed with the French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD) and the Center for Training and Research in Infectious Diseases in Guinea (CERFIG). Made up of 802 former Ebola patients enrolled in several centers across Guinea, this cohort aimed to describe and analyze the clinical, immunological, psychological, and socio-anthropological impacts of Ebola over 2 years [see reference below for this multidisciplinary observational cohort study. - Mod.LK]

The study, published in Nature Communications and conducted by Prof. Yves Levy with Aurelie Wiedemann at the Vaccine Research Institute (VRI, Inserm/Universite Paris-Est Creteil), is one of the first to focus on the long-term immuno-inflammatory profile of Ebola survivors.

The researchers based their study on the analysis of blood samples from 35 members of the PostEboGui cohort who were recruited to participate in this study on average, 2 years after the onset of their disease. A control group was also set up to compare their immune profiles. Each patient was seen 3 times for these blood samples to be taken. Samples of saliva, urine, and semen were also analyzed to rule out the presence of the virus.

Such research was only possible thanks to the involvement of the local teams, which had been specifically trained in handling biological samples. It is, therefore, the fruit of close collaboration between Inserm and IRD teams and Guinean laboratory technicians and scientists at the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and CERFIG.

Inflammation and immune markers
-------------------------------
Analysis of the blood samples showed that even when survivors are physically recovered and no longer have any detectable virus, they still present a specific immune profile, different from that of people who have never contracted the disease.

In particular, the researchers identified the presence of immune cells known as CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells, specific to the virus, which remained in the blood of the 35 survivors 2 years after the disease. Also, there was a higher number of cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells involved in the destruction of the infected cells, as well as the presence of IgG antibodies specific to the Ebola virus in these survivors.

What is more, the team showed the presence of a large number of inflammatory markers in the blood samples (pro-inflammatory cytokines, markers of immune activation), which indicate the persistence of inflammation in Ebola survivors. Finally, this study showed that certain specific immune markers were associated with the persistence of symptoms in these patients.

These findings, therefore, highlight the long-term persistence of Ebola-specific immune activity and intense and chronic inflammation in these former patients, 2 years after being infected with the virus.

"Our work underscores the importance of long-term follow-up of Ebola survivors, something that has already been emphasized in studies of clinical after-effects. It is important to see how their condition and immune profile evolve and whether they are moving towards a chronic disease." Aurelie Wiedemann, Vaccine Research Institute (VRI, Inserm/Universite Paris-Est Creteil)

In the context of the ongoing Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a new cohort with an immunity component is currently being developed there, following a similar strategy to that used to implement PostEboGui. It will be an opportunity for researchers to confirm their findings on the immune profile of survivors in a more significant number of patients.

The long term sequelae of Ebola are important to understand as they add to the burden of this devastating disease. Similarly, as we learn more about COVID-19, sequelae following apparent recovery from the disease are becoming evident. - Mod.LK
