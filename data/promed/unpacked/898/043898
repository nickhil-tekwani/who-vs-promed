A particularly deadly strain of feline distemper, known as panleukopenia,
has surfaced along the Wasatch Front in Utah. Cat owners are advised to
keep their pets inside and ensure they are properly vaccinated, Salt Lake
County Animal Services says.
Shelters and animal rescue organizations from Utah County to Davis County
have reported receiving cats who died suddenly after showing few symptoms
of illness, said Temma Martin, public relations/media coordinator for the
Salt Lake County agency. The disease is not associated with shelters aside
from the aspect the shelters receive large numbers of animals.
Martin said Animal Services is working with local veterinarians and Pfizer
Animal Health to conduct research on the recent outbreak. Pfizer
manufactures the vaccine given to cats as they enter the [animal] shelter.
Feline panleukopenia is highly contagious, and the virus is very stable, so
it may remain infectious at room temperature for up to a year. Cats are
usually infected through direct contact with an infected cat's blood,
urine, feces or nasal secretions. Cats may also be exposed to the virus
through bedding, cages, food dishes or the hands or clothing of those who
handle them.
While the disease may be treatable, about 75 percent of kittens up to 16
weeks of age with feline panleukopenia die. About 50 percent of older
kittens and cats die from the illness. The current strain of the virus
seems to be claiming more adult cats than kittens. Vaccines offer the best
protection. But to be effective, they must be administered before the cat
is exposed and infected. Kittens receive their first vaccination between
six and 11 weeks. The vaccination must be repeated annually to maintain
effective immunity, Martin said.

[This strain may have mutated to affect more adult animals, or annual
vaccinations of adult animals may have dropped in the surrounding area,
resulting in an essentially naive population. However, the sudden death of
adult animals with few signs suggests a change in the strain.
Feline panleukopenia is sometimes called feline distemper. Typically the
cats have a fever (104 to 107 degrees F), are depressed and develop
anorexia after an incubation period of 2 to 7 days. Vomiting may develop 1
to 2 days after the onset of fever. Diarrhea tends to begin a little later.
Extreme dehydration develops rapidly, even when the animal is continuously
drinking. Abdominal pain may be evidenced on palpation, which may induce
vomiting.
Treatment is generally symptomatic; supporting the animal by correcting
electrolyte imbalances, hypoglycemia, temperature monitoring, fluid
replacements, etc. Parenteral nutrition is appropriate. These animals are
in a very weakened condition and should be protected from exposure to any
bacterial illness. In veterinary hospitals there are many bacterial
illnesses and consequently broad spectrum antibiotics are often appropriate
to help the animal fight the secondary infections. The antibiotics do
nothing for the virus.
Excellent inactivated and modified live vaccines are available for
prevention. The vaccine is usually given in a series of 2 when the animal
is a kitten and must be repeated annually. - Mod.TG]
