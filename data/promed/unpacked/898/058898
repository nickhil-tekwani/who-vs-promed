The New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) reports a cat has been diagnosed with plague in Los Alamos County, making it the 1st plague case in New Mexico this year [2021].

"NMDOH staff will conduct an environmental investigation to ensure the safety of the immediate family and neighbors," said Secretary-Designate Dr. Tracie Collins. "We also offer a friendly reminder: even in the midst of a global pandemic, other diseases still occur in New Mexico, and there are steps people can take to keep themselves and their pets safe."

The cat, which became ill in early January [2021], has now recovered following veterinary treatment.

Plague is a bacterial disease in wildlife and is generally transmitted to pets through the bites of infected fleas or after eating an infected animal. Humans can also contract plague via infected fleas or direct contact with infected animals.

Symptoms of plague in humans include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, and weakness. In most cases there is a painful swelling of the lymph node in the groin, armpit, or neck area. Plague symptoms in cats and dogs are fever, lethargy, and loss of appetite; there may be swelling in the lymph nodes under the jaw. With prompt diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment, the probability of death in people and pets can be greatly reduced. Physicians or veterinarians who suspect plague should promptly report to NMDOH.

To prevent plague,
- avoid sick or dead rodents and rabbits, as well as their nests and burrows;
- prevent your pets from roaming and hunting;
- talk to your veterinarian about using an appropriate flea control product on your pets;
- have any sick pets examined promptly by a veterinarian;
- contact your medical provider about any unexplained illness involving a sudden and severe fever;
- clean up areas near the home where rodents could live, such as woodpiles, brush piles, junk, and abandoned vehicles;
- place hay, wood, and compost piles as far as possible from your home;
- avoid leaving pet food and water where rodents and wildlife can access it.

[Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents. It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Surveillance efforts testing fleas are very important to detect circulation of _Y. pestis_ and risk of infection.

Plague may infect human beings through several routes: 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals (mentioned previously); 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues, generally from an animal; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.

Clinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit, if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever (or chills). These clinical signs may be present in the dog as well. Swelling under the jaw in cats is frequently mistaken as a cat-fight abscess. When this mistake occurs and the caregiver or veterinarian does not take precautions, such as exam gloves, the swelling may rupture on palpation and possibly expose the owner or the veterinarian though even small scratches on the hands or cuticles of the fingers.

This cat is clearly an indication that the _Y. pestis_ bacteria is circulating in the area's fleas.

If your pets are not on flea prevention, please ask your veterinarian about the best flea prevention. Bathing your pet in dishwashing soap is not sufficient to help your pet avoid diseases carried by fleas. Some of the over-the-counter flea prevention products may be harmful to your pet, so please check with your veterinarian. It is also a good time to make sure your pet is current on a rabies shot.

Keeping your pets inside is best, and being inside a yard will help diminish your pet's ability to consume a dead animal and will further reduce the risk of plague to both you and your animal. - Mod.TG
