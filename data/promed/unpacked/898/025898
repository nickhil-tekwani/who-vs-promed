[The presence of West Nile virus (WNV) in Europe was 1st recorded in 1958. Since then, the virus has caused sporadic cases and outbreaks of human and equine disease, predominantly in southern countries. This is the 2nd bird reported infected with WNV in the region. In September [2018], there was a case in Slovenia (see ProMED post 20180919.6038991).

In Europe, WNV circulates in resident and migratory birds. Despite its high virulence in birds from North America (especially crows), WNV circulates relatively harmlessly in the Old World, presumably reflecting co-evolution of virus and host over a long period (Gould et al. EID 2006;12:549-555). However, the crow infected by WNV reported here, as the one infected in Slovenia a month ago, was found dead. We do not have information about the signs and lesions of this crow, which could indicate whether the death of this animal was due to WNV. - Mod.PMB
