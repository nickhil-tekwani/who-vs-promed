All dogs at Cheyenne shelter to be euthanized because of dog flu outbreak
i-----------------------------------------------
All 70 to 80 dogs at the Cheyenne Animal Shelter will be euthanized
because of an outbreak of canine influenza that has closed the
shelter for more than 2 weeks, shelter officials announced.
Four dogs at the shelter have died, and the virus was confirmed
Friday [28 Apr 2006] in 4 of 5 samples submitted for testing, the
officials said Monday [1 May 2006] at a City Council meeting.
Misty Courtney, a shelter employee for about 4 months, opposed the
decision. She said that after learning about it Sunday [30 Apr 2006],
she stopped by the dogs' kennels. "I almost lost it," she said. "I
wanted to take them and escape."
But shelter officials said there was no way to test for the virus
quickly and thus no way to tell which dogs were infected. Shelter
director Alan Cohen said that unless all the dogs were killed, he
couldn't guarantee that they wouldn't re-infect themselves and other animals.
"If I do not euthanize these animals, how can I let them loose
knowing they might spread it to the community? If we don't stop these
70, they may serve as vectors to spread it to the entire community," he said.
The virus has also been turning up in dogs around town. As of Monday
[1 May 2006], Frontier Animal Clinic had confirmed 3 cases, including
one dog that died rapidly, according to clinic veterinarian Gary Norwood.
Norwood urged dog owners to remain calm and take precautions. He said
that while the virus has a fatality rate of 3 to 10 percent, most
dogs recover or never even show symptoms.
"For 95 percent of cases, the dog's going to recover just fine," he
said. "People need to not panic. Respect that this virus has entered
our community. Use logic. Use hygiene. This virus is susceptible to
normal hygiene procedures."
Officials also urged dog owners to isolate their pets over the next few weeks.
Shelter records show that the outbreak began about 3 weeks ago, when
staff noticed signs similar to kennel cough, a mild and common
infection in dogs. But shelter staff began to worry that the disease
was canine influenza.
One adoption kennel was closed on 11 Apr 2006. The rest of the
shelter was closed on 17 Apr 2006, and all adoptions were halted.
Meanwhile, the disease spread rapidly, killing 4 dogs.
Shelter officials said they considered isolating the dogs instead of
euthanizing them, but the difficulty of being sure of eradicating the
disease ruled out that option.
Assistant state veterinarian Walt Cook asked the 4 veterinarians at
the council meeting whether they supported the euthanasia decision.
All 4 raised their hands. "As regrettable as this is, I think this is
the most reasonable decision, and I commend it," he said.

[If there is a case fatality rate of only 3 to 10 percent, and 95
percent of the dogs will recover, then it seems an extreme measure to
euthanize all of the animals. It would seem logical to stop adoptions
until this disease has run its course. If there is no money to treat
the sick animals, then perhaps euthanasia could be used on the those
that are unlikely to recover. - Mod.TG]
