NBC employee tests positive for skin anthrax
--------------------------------------------
NEW YORK (CNN) -- An NBC "Nightly News" employee who received mail
containing a suspicious white powder tested positive for a skin-based
anthrax infection, New York officials said Friday. The NBC employee, a
woman, is in good condition and expected to recover, network executives
said.
In a memo to NBC employees sent Friday morning, NBC President Andy Lack
and NBC Chairman Bob Wright stressed that the cutaneous infection was
"not the same respiratory anthrax that has been reported in the news,"
referring to the cases in Florida.
Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson said "we have no
proof whatsoever" that this latest case is connected to terrorist
activity. He stressed that anthrax is not contagious in humans and is
usually treatable if detected early.
The woman was not identified beyond her affiliation with "NBC Nightly
News." A network source said the envelope was addressed to anchorman Tom
Brokaw. She handled an envelope 25 Sep 2001 containing a white powder,
and she reported it to authorities, Wright said. The powder tested
negative for anthrax. The positive results became known Friday morning,
but she has been taking antibiotics [Cipro since October 1.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the FBI, and the New
York City Health Department are investigating. Giuliani said all
employees who may have been exposed will be tested, and some will likely
be given antibiotics. Investigators will conduct environmental tests on
several areas of the NBC building, he added.
A government source told CNN the source of the bacteria was
"undetermined" and that state and local public health officials have
been in contact with federal health and law enforcement authorities.
Cutaneous anthrax is not as serious as inhalation anthrax, which brings
bacteria spores directly into the lungs.
Giuliani disclosed that The New York Times also had received a
suspicious envelope, and that investigators were testing its powdery
contents but no results were expected for 12 hours. Police were called
and employees were moved from the newsroom on the third floor of the
building to other floors while the air in the newsroom was tested for
radioactive and chemical substances, a spokeswoman for the newspaper
said. The tests were negative. Newsroom operations continued as normal,
but several media outlets -- CBS News and ABC in New York, and
Atlanta-based CNN -- closed their mailrooms as a precaution.
Police closed 43rd Street between Eighth Avenue and Broadway -- in the
heart of the usually congested theater district where the Times building
is located -- to vehicle and pedestrian traffic.

[At this time there is no information as to whether this CDC confirmed
cutaneous case is of the same strain as the Florida isolates. The New
York Times "powder" was very similar to talcum powder in appearance and
smell -- brave person. I would point out that 25 Sep 2001 was the
probable date of exposure for [two of the patients in Florida. That the NBC
material tested negative at 3 very competent laboratories raises a
suspicion that maybe this young lady found a hoax but missed an envelope
with anthrax spores. If that is so it is suggestive that whoever got
that envelope possibly did not acquire any spores. Or put another way,
we are seeing the numerator but what is the denominator of "envelopes"
posted with spores in this series of possibly connected events.
Obviously when the NBC isolate is strain-identified there will then be
more or less evidence whether the 2 events are joined. - Mod.MHJ

And as reported by Carr and Ray in Journal of Infectious Diseases
100;169-171,1957. They cultured 101 employees in two goat hair
processing textile mills and recovered _B. anthracis_ from 7 nasal swabs
and 7 pharyngeal washings all different people who had no symptoms and
worked in the mills. There was some correlation with the degree of
environmental contamination with _B. anthracis_ in each of their work
areas.

[Phil researched anthrax in the wool & hair industries in the 1950s &
1960s which are reported in an important series of papers, that are well
worth re-reading today. Thank you Phil. - Mod.MHJ
