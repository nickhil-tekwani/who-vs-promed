An investigation was under way into the possibility a baby girl may have
contracted the human form of mad cow disease from her mother. A department
of health spokesman confirmed tests were being carried out and the
possibility of maternal transmission of new variant CJD (nvCJD) was being
investigated.
It is understood the baby girl, who has been ill since birth last year, is
being treated in a Midlands hospital with her mother, who has been
confirmed as suffering from nvCJD. The passing of nvCJD from mother to baby
was previously thought to be very unlikely.
The spokesman said: "We understand all the necessary investigations are
under way by the NHS trust involved and the appropriate specialists."
It was reported late last month that a 24-year-old mother of a young baby
was in a serious condition in Walsgrave hospital, Coventry, suffering from
a suspected case of nvCJD. The hospital added that the woman's daughter,
aged 3 months at the time, was also seriously ill, but that it was not
thought the child had the same illness.
Hospital staff would not comment yesterday on whether the cases were linked.

Association 29 Feb 2000

This press agency reports that "Baby May Be Clear Of Mother's CJD " It
announced the tests done on the girl indicate she may not have the disease
while the mother has been confirmed as suffering from nvCJD. Even if there
is a lack of tissue to run all tests, a medical authority reported that
"the indications are this child doesn't have CJD".
