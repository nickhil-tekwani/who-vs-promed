The New South Wales (NSW) Department of Primary Industries (DPI) is urging horse owners to remain vigilant, following confirmation of Hendra virus infection in an unvaccinated horse near Tweed Heads. NSW Chief Veterinary Officer, Dr. Sarah Britton, said the property near Tweed Heads has been placed under movement restrictions by Local Land Services.

"This is the 1st confirmed case of Hendra virus in NSW this year [2018]," Dr. Britton said. "Samples from the horse were sent by a private veterinarian for laboratory analysis to Queensland's Biosecurity Sciences Laboratory at Coopers Plains and initial test results confirmed Hendra virus. The 4-year-old Arab cross was initially noticed by the owner to be lethargic and not eating properly. It deteriorated the next day and was euthanised by a private veterinarian."

Dr. Britton said vaccination of horses is the most effective way to help manage Hendra virus disease. "Vaccination of horses provides a public health and work health and safety benefit by reducing the risk of Hendra transmission to humans and other susceptible animals," she said.

She added, "Whenever Hendra infection is suspected, even in vaccinated horses, appropriate biosecurity precautions, including personal protective equipment (PPE), should be used. Horse owners are encouraged to discuss the option of Hendra vaccination of their horse with their veterinarian. Horses should also be kept away from flowering and fruiting trees that are attractive to bats. Do not place feed and water under trees, and cover feed and water containers with a shelter so they cannot be contaminated from above."

If your horse in unwell, keep people and animals away from the horse and call your private veterinarian immediately. If your vet is unavailable, in Australia you can call a District Veterinarian with the Local Land Services or the Animal Biosecurity Emergency Hotline on 1 800 675 888.

[Hendra virus is an RNA virus that is a member of the _Paramyxoviridae_ family of viruses and is classified in the genus _Henipavirus_. Flying foxes (_Pteropus_ spp. -- fruit bats) are the natural reservoir of Hendra virus. Horses, dogs and humans have been naturally infected with Hendra virus, with high case fatality rates in horses and humans.

Transmission of Hendra virus from horse to horse appears to be relatively inefficient but has occurred among horses in close contact, including some horses in paddock situations. Transmission is more effective among stabled horses. There is no evidence of direct transmission of Hendra virus infection from flying foxes to humans. Transmission by fomites (e.g., contaminated tack) cannot be excluded; however, the virus is thought to survive for only a short time in the environment and is readily inactivated by detergents and disinfectants.

Hendra virus -- previously known as equine morbillivirus infection -- is a notifiable disease and has been declared as an emergency animal disease (EAD). It is a zoonotic agent, capable of causing serious illness and death in humans. For urgent assistance or advice, contact the Emergency Animal Disease Hotline in Australia on 1 800 675 888.

Current situation
All known Hendra virus cases have occurred in Queensland or northern NSW, but cases could occur wherever there are flying foxes or in horses that had recent contact with flying foxes prior to movement. Hendra virus infection was 1st recognised in 1994 in Australia, when it caused an outbreak of acute, fatal respiratory disease that killed 14 horses. During the 1st outbreak, the horse trainer also died, and there was a nonfatal infection of another person closely involved with the sick horses. A retrospective diagnosis was made of a prior case (also in 1994) involving the death of 2 horses and one human. From 1994 to 2010, Hendra virus was confirmed in an additional 11 premises in Queensland and one premise in northern NSW. Subsequently, there has been an increase in the number of cases, with 18 further incidents in Queensland and northern NSW between June and October 2011 alone. A total of 21 (15 in Queensland and 6 in northern NSW) occurred between 2012 and the end of 2015.

Hendra infection has also been detected in 2 dogs that were in close contact with infected horses. Both dogs remained clinically normal with no history of related illness. A total of 7 cases of human infection have been detected. Of these, 4 have been fatal. One of the human deaths occurred 14 months after initial exposure during the postmortem examination of an affected horse. Updated statistics on Hendra virus outbreaks, including locations, dates and confirmed human and animal cases, may be found at https://www.ava.com.au/.

Clinical signs
Clinical signs are highly variable but usually have a very rapid, acute onset and range from mild to severe. The incubation period for Hendra virus in horses ranges from 5 to 16 days. Signs consistent with colic have been the initial sign described in many cases. Dead horses may appear to have met with misadventure. Many horses are found dead with few, if any, prior signs. Clinical signs of Hendra virus include a high case fatality rate, pyrexia (fever), discomfort (weight shifting between legs), neurological changes, ataxia - "wobbly gait," head-pressing, muscle twitching, depression, altered consciousness - "dazed," aimless walking, head tilting, circling, apparent blindness, urinary incontinence, respiratory distress, dyspnoea, tachypnoea, white or blood-tinged frothy discharge from the mouth and nares (particularly in the terminal stages), weakness and collapse with inability to rise, and/or sudden death.

Control
Infection control practices to minimise Hendra virus risks include wearing suitable PPE to protect against contact with the horse and its blood and body substances, as well as adopting personal hygiene and decontamination practices. All persons who are at risk, including assisting persons, should be properly protected.

No vaccine is currently available for use in humans. A vaccine against Hendra virus has been developed for horses and is commercially available. Find out more at https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/animals-and-livestock/horses/health-and-disease/hendra-virus.

The vaccine is the most effective way of reducing the risk of Hendra virus infection and provides a work health and safety, as well as a public health, benefit and there is a high level of confidence in the vaccine held by veterinarians and by both Queensland and NSW State Governments and the Australian Government through the Animal Health Committee. This has been evidenced in outbreak situations since the vaccine became available. More information is provided at the Australian Veterinary Association website: https://www.ava.com.au/hendra-virus-vaccine.

Sadly, cats and dogs have also been found to be affected. It seems the best plan of action is to vaccinate your horse and keep them out of pastures where the flying foxes are. Cover feed and water sources. If your horse becomes ill, protect your smaller pets (cats and dogs), as well as yourself. - Mod.TG
