Passenger tests negative for Ebola
----------------------------------
An airline passenger who had been transferred to Westmead Hospital has returned negative results for Ebola, after being put in isolation at Sydney Airport when they [sic] came back from West Africa and reported having a low-grade temperature.

NSW [New South Wales] acting chief health officer Dr Jeremy McAnulty said the patient was not a risk factor for Ebola. The person is due to be released from hospital after results of 2 tests proved negative for Ebola. "The person has no other significant symptoms, appears otherwise well and reports no risk factors for Ebola virus," Dr McAnulty said. The patient will be released on Christmas Eve [24 Dec 2014] and will be monitored for up to 3 weeks.

UK: Ebola advice for dental care teams
--------------------------------------
The UK has published guidance for dental practice staff who encounter patients with Ebola virus disease (EVD): PHE [Public Health England] publications gateway number: 2014616 (PDF). The document contains information on: transmission, symptoms, identifying patients at risk, dental care, general standards of infection control and decontamination [of EVD]. The basic message is that it is important for the protection of patients, public and dental teams that high standards of infection control and decontamination are in place at all times, even though risk of infection in the UK is considered low.

Guidance for safe handling of human remains of Ebola patients in US hospitals and mortuaries
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Who this is for: personnel who perform postmortem care in US hospitals and mortuaries

What this is for: to protect against the postmortem spread of Ebola infection at the site of death, prior to transport, during transport, at the mortuary and during final disposition of remains

How to use: to guide staff in the safe handling of human remains that may contain Ebola virus by properly using personal protective equipment [PPE] and following decontamination measures at every step of the process.

Key points
----------
In patients who die of Ebola virus infection, the virus can be detected throughout the body.

Ebola virus can continue to be transmitted in postmortem care settings through unsafe handling of remains.

Handling should be kept to a minimum and only trained personnel wearing PPE should touch, or move, any Ebola-infected remains.

Remains should be cremated or buried promptly in a hermetically sealed casket; autopsies should be avoided.

Transportation of remains outside the US must comply with the regulations of the country of destination, and should be coordinated in advance with relevant authorities.

This document provides guidance on the safe handling of human remains that may contain Ebola virus. These recommendations are for use by personnel who perform postmortem care in US hospitals and mortuaries. In patients who die of Ebola, the virus can be detected throughout the body. Ebola virus can be transmitted in postmortem care settings by laceration and puncture with contaminated instruments used during postmortem care through direct handling of human remains without appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). It can also be transmitted through splashes of blood or other body fluids such as urine, saliva, or feces to unprotected mucosa (eyes, nose, or mouth), which occur during postmortem care.

Only personnel trained in handling infected human remains, and wearing PPE, should touch or move, any Ebola-infected remains.

Keep handling of human remains to a minimum.

Avoid autopsies on patients who have died of Ebola. If an autopsy is necessary, the state health department and CDC should be consulted regarding additional precautions.

CDC laboratory worker monitored for possible Ebola exposure
-----------------------------------------------------------
A laboratory technician for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] has been placed under observation for possible exposure to Ebola virus due to an apparent mix-up in lab specimens, the Atlanta [Georgia]-based agency said on Wednesday [24 Dec 2014]. The technician, who was working on Monday [22 Dec 2014] with Ebola specimens that were supposed to have been inactivated but which may instead have contained live virus, will be monitored for signs of infection for 21 days, the disease's incubation period, CDC officials said...

[5] USA (Michigan): monitoring 14 individuals for Ebola infection

Monitoring individuals for Ebola infection
------------------------------------------
There are currently 14 individuals being actively monitored (including one who is being monitored more carefully) in Michigan (52 have cleared [the 21-day quarantine period, which] includes twice daily measurement of temperature and monitoring of symptoms) [see guidance document for Michigan: http://www.michigan.gov/documents/emergingdiseases/Michigan_EBOLA_Guidance_464829_7.pdf]. The Michigan Department of Community Health and the State network of local public health agencies are currently supporting the monitoring of individuals with a travel history that includes a return to the state from Ebola affected areas.
