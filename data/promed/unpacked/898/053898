[I should have kept my big mouth shut -- Charlie has not yet left for the
wilds of Colorado, and here is his reply to my comment on the above subject
- Mod.JW

When the original RFI arrived, asking for information supporting a statement
about the *antigenic* stability of Ebola virus, I responded by saying that
there
had been no such statement made. Karl Johnson had spoken in his usual
insightful and erudite manner about the "stability" of Ebola virus. I assumed
Karl was talking about the *genetic* stability of Ebola virus isolates from
hither and yon. It is clear that within a discrete geographic area, Ebola
virues are genetically stable over a period of nearly two decades. As no one
has done antigenic cross-comparisons (for many reasons, including the fact
that sequences but not isolates exist for many "strains"), there can be no
discussion of such comparisons.
Further, I said that all we know about these viruses is what we know from
gene sequences and isolates from primates, including humans. We do not have
isolates or sequences from other vertebrates or other life forms because we do
not yet know the natural reservoir host(s). Questions of parallel evolution
and coevolution are premature at this time.
