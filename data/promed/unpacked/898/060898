Comoros: Chikungunya Virus Identified as Cause of Epidemic
---------------------------------------------------
Doctors have now confirmed that Chikungunya virus is the cause of an
epidemic in Ngazidja for about 4 months, since January 2005, and that the
disease is not dengue fever as initially supposed. The diagnosis has been
confirmed by results of laboratory tests carried out in a US Laboratory.
The number of cases is declining notably in the central part of the island,
which was the 1st region to be affected by the virus.

[Chikungunya virus is a mosquito-transmitted virus classified in the family
_Togaviridae_ (not related to dengue virus which is an arbovirus classified
in the family _Flaviviridae_). Chikungunya (meaning "doubled up") virus
was isolated during an epidemic in Tanzania in 1952 from both patients and
mosquitoes. Subsequently it has been isolated frequently from humans and
mosquitoes in tropical Africa, India, and Southeast Asia. Non-human
reservoir species have not been identified unequivocally, and migrants and
travellers are blamed frequently for spread of infection; e.g., for the
comparatively recent introduction of the disease into Malaysia.
Recent laboratory studies suggest that in Southeast Asia, _Stegomyia
albopicta_ [_Aedes albopictus_] is a more competent vector of chikungunya
virus than _Stegomyia aegypti_ [_Aedes aegypti_].
The largest epidemics of chikungunya in recent years have occurred in India
and Indonesia. The clinical features of the disease associated with this
virus resemble to some extent those of dengue fever with which it is often
confused. In the case of chikungunya virus infection, after an incubation
period of 2 to 4 days, there is sudden onset of fever, followed by
crippling joint pains which may temporarily incapacitate the patient.
Arthralgia is the most typical sign, occurring in around 70 percent of
cases. The acute phase of the disease lasts for 2 to 4 days with recovery
in 5 to 7 days. Treatment is palliative.
The Comoros Islands lie off the east coast of Africa, approximately midway
between northern Mozambique and the northern tip of Madagascar. - Mod.CP]
