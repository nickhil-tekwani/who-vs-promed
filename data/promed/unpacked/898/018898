A total of 2 men are in intensive care fighting legionnaires' disease while a 3rd is also in hospital connected to a Gladstone Park outbreak. The Department of Health issued a warning over the outbreak today after all 3 men became ill following visits to the Airport West and Gladstone Park Shopping Centres between [Fri 20 and Thu 26 Apr 2018].

Health officers are now investigating cooling towers in the northern suburb area to determine the cause of the outbreak. Victoria's deputy chief health officer Dr Brett Sutton said the 3 ill men are all aged in their 60s and 70s. After the 1st case emerged on [Sat 28 Apr 2018], 2 more were confirmed yesterday [Thu 3 May 2018], establishing a link to the Gladstone Park area.

"My message to people who have visited the Gladstone Park area between mid-April and earlier this week [week of Sun 29 Apr 2018] and who may be suffering from pneumonia or flu-like symptoms is to visit their GP who will assess the need for testing for Legionnaires' disease," Dr Sutton said. "The Department is continuing to investigate these cases to seek to identify the possible source of their illness." Department teams are taking samples from 9 cooling tower systems in the Gladstone Park areas today [Fri 4 May 2018 ] while also ensuring each is disinfected to make them safe.

Symptoms of Legionnaires' disease typically evolve over 3 or 4 days, including flu-like symptoms such as headache, fever, chills, muscle aches and pains, followed by respiratory problems and pneumonia. Because the onset of illness can take up to 10 days after initial contact with the bacteria, new cases of the current outbreak may occur up to mid-May.

There were 67 cases of legionnaires' disease notified in 2017, a small increase on the 40-50 cases confirmed in previous years.

[Genotyping the strains isolated from the 3 patients will help establish a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no isolates for genotyping.
