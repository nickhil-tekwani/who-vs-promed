[The following description is from the USDA-APHIS website concerning
the disease at
<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/animal_diseases/piroplasmosis/index.shtml>:

Equine piroplasmosis is present in South and Central America, the
Caribbean (including Puerto Rico), Africa, the Middle East, and
Eastern and Southern Europe. Only the United States, Canada,
Australia, Japan, England and Ireland are not considered to be endemic areas.

This disease is a disease of Equidae (horses, donkeys, mules, and
zebras), and is caused by 2 parasitic organisms, _Babesia equi_ and
_Babesia caballi_. Although, equine piroplasmosis is primarily
transmitted to horses by ticks, this bloodborne disease has been
spread mechanically from animal to animal by contaminated needles.
Once infected, an equine can take 7 to 22 days to show signs of illness.

Cases of equine piroplasmosis can be mild or acute, depending on the
virulence of the parasite. Acutely affected equines can have fever,
anemia, jaundiced mucous membranes, swollen abdomens, and labored
breathing. Equine piroplasmosis can also cause equines to have
roughened hair coats, constipation, and colic. In its milder form,
equine piroplasmosis causes equines to appear weak and show lack of appetite.

The greatest risk for introduction of this disease is through trading
of animals or international equestrian sports, where infected and
non-infected animals are in contact. Many disease free countries have
the climate suitable for a foreign tick vector, or have ticks which
could act as vectors.

What the website blurb presented here doesn't mention is that there
appears to be a constant dribble of cases beginning with the Florida
cases in 2008. Since then, there have been cases identified in
Missouri, Texas, New Mexico, Utah and now New Mexico again in 2010.
These incursions were the 1st ones since the disease was eradicated
from the United States in 1988.

International travel and trade of horses and the use of contaminated
syringes are thought to be risk factors for the development of the
disease. If we are to prevent the dribble of cases from becoming a
slow flow of cases over the next few years, this may be the time to
dig in and do intensive epidemiology so that we have a better answer
to questions of where these cases come from and how a single horse in
New Mexico gets infected.

The report indicates that such investigations were made. Clearly,
many times epidemiology does not reveal the source of the disease,
but the constant presence of the disease is worrisome in terms of
horse health status, and even more intensive investigations may be
warranted. - Mod.PC]
