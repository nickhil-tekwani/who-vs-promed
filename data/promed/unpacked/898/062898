The Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has confirmed that since the re-emergence of yellow fever in Nigeria in [September 2017], at least 358 suspected cases have been recorded in 16 states where the disease has already led to 45 deaths.

As part of activities to find solution to the outbreak, a total of 25 million people are scheduled to be vaccinated in a campaign that has already begun in 3 states: Zamfara in the North-East, Kogi in the Center and Kwara in the West; and health workers have already been mobilised across the country. "The country is also strengthening its routine immunisation coverage," the statement added.

In a related development, the West African Health Organization (WAHO), in its efforts to contribute to the capacity building of ECOWAS Member States in the area of preparedness and response to epidemics, is supporting the establishment of national emergency management mechanisms for public health emergencies.

To test these mechanisms and procedures in place for the management of major public health events in the ECOWAS region, WAHO is organising a Yellow Fever Simulation Exercise (SIMEX) in Lagos in collaboration with the NCDC. The purpose of the SIMEX is to provide various partner institutions with a national and regional coordination framework for a multi-sectoral response to a public health emergency.

This exercise would focus on an actual and large scale simulation of an epidemic of Yellow Fever. In addition to checking the viability and compatibility of existing mechanisms in their implementation, this SIMEX would not only enhance awareness among epidemic control managers but also enhance their ability to effectively and timely respond to any Yellow Fever epidemics.

WAHO as per its mandate remains committed in supporting Nigeria and the SIMEX being jointly organised with the Nigeria CDC with the financial support from the World Bank-REDISSE project, is one of such projects to support Member states

[The case count in the above report is the same as that of the 2 Jan 2018 Nigeria Center for Disease Control Situation Report, so one does not know if there have been new cases since then. Nevertheless, embarking on a massive vaccination campaign is prudent. However, this proposed extensive vaccination campaign is not an easy task in a country as large and populous as Nigeria. Intensified surveillance and response with vaccination campaigns are necessary as long as new cases continue to occur, but given the distribution of cases in so many states, it will be a logistical challenge for state and national health agencies and their collaborators. One hopes that the 2 early phases of the campaign are sufficient to contain the outbreak.

The efforts of the West African Health Organization (WAHO) to contribute to the capacity building of ECOWAS Member States in the area of preparedness and response to epidemics, is encouraging news. This effort will support the establishment of national emergency management mechanisms for public health emergencies such as yellow fever or Ebola outbreaks. The recent yellow fever outbreak in Angola and Ebola in West Africa illustrate the need for rapid and effective response. - Mod.TY
