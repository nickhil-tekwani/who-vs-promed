In view of Dr. Kock's 9 March 2000 posting about declining water levels in
lakes in affected areas, I wonder about the possible role of botulism in
this syndrome (similar to the situation of heavy losses d.t. botulism in
wild waterfowl due to reduced oxygen tension toxin production at feeding
depth in drying sloughs and ponds). Could low levels of botulinum toxin
cause increasing trunk paresis without progressing to systemic signs? I
understand that these elephants gradually starve because of reduced ability
to feed - could some of the weakness attributed to starvation be caused by
'systemic' botulism?
I wonder if vaccinating a few elephants with multivalent _C botulinum_
toxoid (dose?) could be done to see if the vaccinated group has a lower
incidence than an unvaccinated control group. Also, from a tv program I saw
about this, it seems that older bulls were most affected (but I may be
wrong on this) - if so, close observation of the feeding habits of this
group to see where/what they eat vs. the general population may be of some
value in determining the possible source of the problem.

I have not been following all of the commentary on flaccid trunk disease,
so I am not sure if I missed someone suggesting the possibility that this
is an outbreak of botulism. Floppy baby syndrome appears to have some
similar features and this is related to colonization of the intestinal
tract by _Clostrium botulinum_. Further, the association with a water
source is also pertinent.
Botulism poisoning of waterfowl is well recognized. It occurs when water
sources become anoxic and the birds then disturb the mud on the bottom of
ponds while searching for foods. Assume that this could be a similar
mechanism for the elephants.

[Botulism has certainly been tossed around in this discussion. However to
affect the trunk exclusively, it would have to be injected vs ingested.
There was some trial of some sort about a year ago here in the states (I
cannot seem to put my hands on it right now) that tried to induce this
syndrome with bot tox on ingestion. It failed miserably, but the students
on hand had to treat the elephant instead.
I suspect these folks are correct with regard to ideal conditions for _C.
botulinum_. I do not know of anyone that has tested the mud/low water
regions for that. - Mod. TG
