Abstract
---------
We identified and isolated a novel Hendra virus (HeV) variant not detected by routine testing from a horse in Queensland, Australia, that died from acute illness with signs consistent with HeV infection. Using whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, we determined the variant had approximately 83% nt identity with prototypic HeV. In silico and in vitro comparisons of the receptor-binding protein with prototypic HeV support that the human monoclonal antibody m102.4 used for postexposure prophylaxis and current equine vaccine will be effective against this variant. An updated quantitative PCR developed for routine surveillance resulted in subsequent case detection. Genetic sequence consistency with virus detected in grey-headed flying foxes suggest the variant circulates at least among this species. Studies are needed to determine infection kinetics, pathogenicity, reservoir-species associations, viral-host coevolution, and spillover dynamics for this virus. Surveillance and biosecurity practices should be updated to acknowledge HeV spillover risk across all regions frequented by flying foxes.

Highly pathogenic zoonotic Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) are prototypic members of the genus _Henipavirus_, family Paramyxoviridae, that have natural reservoirs in pteropodid flying foxes (1). These viruses exhibit wide mammalian host tropism, cause severe acute respiratory and encephalitic disease mediated by endothelial vasculitis, have high case-fatality rates, and cause chronic encephalitis among survivors (2-4). By March 2021, a total of 63 natural HeV spillovers had been recognized in horses in Australia, resulting in 105 horse deaths (5,6) and 4 deaths among 7 confirmed human cases (7). In southern Asia, NiV has caused zoonotic outbreaks with 70%-91% case-fatality rates, resulting in greater than 700 human deaths (8-10). In response to the zoonotic disease threat posed by henipaviruses to humans and domestic animals, vaccines and postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) have been developed (11). The vaccines include a subunit vaccine, Equivac HeV (Zoetis, https://www.zoetis.com.au), based on the soluble recombinant G-attachment glycoprotein (receptor-binding protein [RBP]) of HeV (HeV-sG), that has been used for horses in Australia since 2012 (12). The human monoclonal antibody (mAb) m102.4 has been administered as emergency PEP in 16 human cases and has demonstrated safety, tolerability, and intended immunogenicity in phase 1 trials (13). Combinations of cross-reactive humanized fusion (F) protein and RBP antibodies have also been described for clinical development as PEP (14-16), and a human vaccine using HeV-sG is now in phase 1 clinical trials (17).

Horses are the predominant species known to be infected with HeV by natural spillover from flying foxes; 2 canine (18) and all known human infections having resulted from close contact with infected horses. HeV transmission from _Pteropus_ spp. (flying foxes) to horses is thought to occur primarily through contaminated urine (19). The spatial distribution of previously detected spillovers to horses and molecular HeV testing of flying fox urine suggests transmission was predominantly from black flying foxes (BFF; _P. alecto_) and spectacled flying foxes (SFF; _P. conspicillatus_) (19,20). However, serologic testing has detected antibodies to HeV or related henipaviruses among all 4 flying fox species in Australia (20-23). Of note, seroprevalence of IgG targeting the HeV RBP has been reported in 43% of grey-headed flying foxes (GHFF; _P. poliocephalus_) in South Australia and Victoria (22) and 60% (169/284) in southeastern Queensland (21).

Australia hosts greater than1 million horses. Their grazing behavior, large respiratory tidal volume, and extensive highly vascularized upper respiratory epithelium may contribute to their vulnerability for HeV spillover (23). Detecting spillover to horses relies on attending veterinarians recognizing clinical manifestations consistent with HeV disease, sampling appropriately, and submitting samples for priority state laboratory testing (24). Passive surveillance using suspected disease testing is affected by a strong regional bias toward areas where HeV has previously been detected and where domestic horse populations overlap with BFF distribution ranges, from eastern coastal Queensland to northern New South Wales (25). Testing for HeV is less commonly performed on horses with similar disease manifestations farther south in Australia because of a perception that spillover infection is less likely to occur in regions without BFF (26). Among greater than1000 horses with manifestations consistent with HeV disease tested annually across regions of established risk, less than 1% are found to be positive (25,27).

Routine testing for equine HeV infection as part of priority disease investigation is specific to the matrix (M) gene (28). Additional nucleoprotein (N) gene-specific testing (29) is limited to HeV-positive samples that undergo confirmatory testing (30) or in the minority (less than 7% nationally) of suspected equine HeV cases submitted directly to the national reference laboratory from states where spillover is considered less likely (25) and state testing is unavailable. This distinction is notable because it means most horse-disease cases found negative for HeV are not investigated further, despite evidence other viruses with potential spillover risk to horses, including novel related batborne paramyxoviruses, circulate in Australia (27,31-35). Likewise, animal health surveillance worldwide often prioritizes targeted testing to exclude pathogens of established importance over open-ended diagnostic approaches, which are inherently more challenging to put in place and interpret. [And possibly more expensive. - Mod.TG]

Using a transdisciplinary, interagency approach combining clinical-syndromic analysis and molecular and serologic testing, we explored the hypothesis that some severe viral disease-like manifestations in horses are consistent with HeV despite the horse testing negative could result from undetected spillover of novel paramyxoviruses from flying foxes potentially posing similar zoonotic risk. Here we report the identification of a previously unrecognized variant of HeV (HeV-var), clinically indistinguishable from prototypic HeV infection, that resulted in severe neurologic and respiratory disease in a horse.

[If the variant can be found in horses, then the next big question is, will it affect humans? Does our current testing detect this variant in humans?

Clearly there is more work to be done. This may also lead to more specific agents for more accurate detection being added to a screening method.

Likely this variant will affect human beings and other animals, as the original virus does. - Mod.TG
