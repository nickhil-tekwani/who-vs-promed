Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection - Introduction of new
live animals; Animals in transit; Vectors

Epidemiological comments: This outbreak was detected following an
investigation launched on 20 Jan 2010 after the United Kingdom
reported having confirmed the disease in 2 horses of a consignment
coming from Romania via Belgium. On 21 Oct 2009, 18 horses arrived
from Romania at a dealer's establishment at Drongen. On 22 Dec 2009, 9
of these horses were sent to the United Kingdom, where the disease was
diagnosed.

The investigation revealed that the other 9 horses were sold
mid-November 2009 to the same person at Assebroek. This person then
sold one horse to his brother at Meetkerke. Movement controls are
applied in the farms where the horses are kept at Drongen, Assebroek
and Meetkerke; no movement of horses is permitted to or from these
facilities.

All horses having been in contact with the horses from Romania are
being traced; movement controls will be applied in the farms, and the
animals will be tested for the disease. The positive animals will be
culled.

Control measures
Measures applied - Quarantine; Movement control inside the country;
Screening; No vaccination; No treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied - Control of arthropods; Modified stamping out

Laboratory name and type Veterinary and Agrochemical Research Centre
(CERVA) (National laboratory)
Species _Equidae_
Test Coggin's test
Test date 29 Jan 2010
Result Positive

Future Reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[It is not surprising to see EIA positive horses occurring in Belgium
when at least 2 of the 9 horses that originated from the same group in
Romania have already tested positive for EIA in the UK. Of the 18
horses exported from Romania (with approximately half winding up in
the UK and half staying in Belgium), positive animals have been
identified in both countries. Now, the traceback should lead us to
Romania and the origin of those horses and, hopefully, some insight
into the epidemiology of their EIA infection.

The distribution of EIA reports to OIE WAHID is quite striking. In the
1st 6 months of 2009, Romania reported 36, 35, 52, 65, 31, 32
outbreaks but none since then to date. In Europe, Slovenia (11
outbreaks), France (3 outbreaks), and Croatia (11 outbreaks) have also
identified outbreaks in EIA reports during this time frame. Russia has
definitely had trouble with EIA, but the numbers reported are hard to
interpret, and Bosnia and Herzogovina reports confirmed
infection/infestation without clinical signs.
