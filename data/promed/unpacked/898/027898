Trypanosomiasis was confirmed in a British soldier who acquired the
infection on a field exercise in the Kasunga National Park, Malawi.
This is the 5th case of trypanosomiasis in travellers to this area
that has been managed in South Africa this year [2007].

The patient presented with acute onset of fever, headache, and
rigors, and a trypanosomal chancre on the thigh. Large numbers of
trypanosomes were noted on a peripheral blood smear. He had a
profound thrombocytopenia, laboratory evidence of a DIC [disseminated
intravascular coagulation] and marked leucopenia. Mild renal and
hepatic dysfunction, and acute respiratory distress syndrome
complicated the acute illness. There was no clinical evidence of
involvement of the central nervous system but examination of the
cerebrospinal fluid will be done only once the peripheral
parasitaemia is cleared and there is an improvement in the
coagulation parameters. He is responding well to suramin treatment.

In November 2005, 2 other travellers were also treated in South
Africa for trypanosomiasis acquired in the Kasunga National Park,
Malawi. Tourists visiting game reserves in central and east African
countries should be alerted to the danger of this disease for which
there are no effective preventive measures, but which if acquired,
requires expert diagnosis and treatment.

[The report confirms our previous report from February 2007 that also
Malawi is an endemic country. We have no data on cases in the
indigenous population. More information on African trypanosomiasis
can be found at Programme Against African Trypanosomiasis (PAAT).

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Drs. Blumberg, Frean and Williams
for this 1st hand report on the importations of African
Trypanosomiasis cases from Malawi to South Africa. We apologize for
the delay in posting -- it was a victim of overzealous server spam
filtering. - Mod.MPP]
