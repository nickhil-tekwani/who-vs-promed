More Ferrets Diagnosed With Pandemic Influenza H1N1
---------------------------------------------------
A total of 3 more ferrets in Oregon have tested positive for the 2009
pandemic influenza H1N1 virus, state officials confirmed this
afternoon [11 Nov 2009], bringing the total number of cases affecting
ferrets in the state to 4.

Dr. Emilio DeBess, the Oregon state public health veterinarian, says
the ferrets that tested positive for the H1N1 virus are among a group
of 9 ferrets that live with a family in the Roseburg, Oregon, area.
All 9 ferrets, DeBess said, exhibited flu-like symptoms, but only 3
were taken to the veterinarian. Those 3 tested positive.

DeBess says members of the family that owns the ferrets were sick
with flu-like signs the week prior to the animals becoming ill. He
adds that there are no indications that the ferrets passed the virus
on to people or any other species of animal.

The 1st ferret in Oregon confirmed with the 2009 pandemic influenza
H1N1 virus was diagnosed in early October. All of the sick ferrets
have recovered.

DeBess reminds pet owners that they should contact their veterinarian
if their pets show any signs of illness, and that they should take
precautions to help reduce the spread of influenza between themselves
and their pets.

"The key message is to protect your animals much like you protect
your family," he says. "Wash your hands, cover your cough and your
sneeze, and do your best to prevent contaminating objects your pet
may come into contact with."

The AVMA is monitoring reports of pandemic influenza H1N1 in animals
and posting updates to its Web site at

Veterinary Medical Association is also providing information at

New Cases of H1N1 in Oregon Ferrets
-----------------------------------
In late October 2009, a client presented 3 of 9 owned ferrets who had
become ill with an influenza-like illness to a veterinarian in the
Roseburg area. The family had human patients with influenza-like
illness about a week prior to onset of illness in the ferrets.

Two of the 3 ferrets presented with fevers (temperature above 103 F),
sneezing, coughing and had nasal discharge. Not all ferrets became
ill at the same time, but 2 - 3 days after the initial 2 cases. Nasal
discharge samples were collected on 27 Oct 2009 and were later
reported as positive for Influenza A.

Further testing at the National Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory
confirmed the isolates as pandemic influenza H1N1. The other ferrets
were not tested, but it is believed they may have had the virus as
well. All 9 ferrets have recovered.

The 1st documented case of the H1N1 virus in a ferret was in a
Portland, Oregon, ferret in early October [2009]. On 5 Oct 2009, a
client brought a ferret to a Portland, Oregon, veterinary hospital.
The ferret had been exhibiting weakness followed by sneezing,
coughing, and an elevated temperature.

Because the client and her children previously had symptoms
compatible with influenza, the attending veterinarian consulted with
Dr. Emilio DeBess, Oregon State Public Health Veterinarian, and both
agreed to test the ferret's nasal secretions for influenza.

On 8 Oct 2009, Oregon State University's Veterinary Diagnostic
Laboratory presumptively diagnosed pandemic influenza H1N1 by PCR
from the nasal secretions of the ferret. On 9 Oct 2009, pandemic
influenza H1N1 was confirmed at the National Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.

Contrary to published media reports, which stated that this Oregon
ferret had died, it has, in fact, recovered. Other ferrets in the US
have now also tested positive for the H1N1 virus. One ferret in Nebraska died.

Transmission
------------
Pet owners should be cautious as we enter this year's flu season.
Ferrets are generally susceptible to influenza A viruses
<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/> under which H1N1 is classified.

In these cases, it is believed that the human owners transmitted the
virus to their ferrets.

Dr. Emilio DeBess, Oregon State Public Health Veterinarian, cautions
owners and veterinarians that it may be possible for ferrets or cats
to transmit this virus to humans. Coughing and sneezing can spread
the virus which can remain infectious for about a week outside the
body. Thoroughly wash your hands when handling sick pets or when you are sick.

Clinical Signs
--------------
If your ferret starts to exhibit signs of a respiratory illness or
lethargy, the animal should be examined by your veterinarian
<http://oregonvma.org/vetdirectory>.

Because of the immunosuppressive effects of influenza, bacterial
infection may be of concern. If discharge from the nose or eyes
becomes discolored (yellow or green), or if your ferret is coughing,
contact your veterinarian.

Treatment
---------
Once a diagnosis is made, your veterinarian may be able to suggest
medications to make the ferret more comfortable. You must also ensure
that your ferret remains hydrated. If your ferret is very lethargic
or off food and water (monitor closely), treatment with fluids and/or
force feeding may be necessary.

[According to: <http://www.currentprotocols.com/protocol/mc15g02>:

"A major challenge in influenza research is the selection of an
appropriate animal model that accurately reflects the disease and
protective immune response to influenza infection in humans. Ferrets
are exquisitely susceptible to infection with human influenza viruses
and are widely believed to be the ideal small animal model for
influenza research. Mice have also been used for influenza vaccine
research for decades. Ferrets are used as an animal model for the
study of influenza because they are susceptible to human influenza
viruses and develop some of the symptoms of influenza that are seen in humans."

And apparently, ferrets are the human model for influenza. With that
being the case, it is startling that many veterinary organizations
seemed mildly surprised to find that ferrets can become infected with
H1N1. Certainly the more we look and test the more likely we are to
find a number of our companion animals are susceptible to a variety
of human respiratory viruses. Perhaps a question of concern is will
this virus mutate as it finds other hosts? Will there be any
reassortment while in different hosts? - Mod.TG]
