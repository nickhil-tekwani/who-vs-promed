Vapotherm, Inc., Stevensville, Maryland, is initiating a nationwide recall
of all Vapotherm 2000i Respiratory Gas Humidification devices. Some of
these devices have been found to contain the _Ralstonia_ species of
bacteria. Ralstonia, as with any Gram-negative organism, may cause
infection, sepsis and in most severe cases be life-threatening.
Health care practitioners should seek alternative respiratory gas
humidification devices. Any health care facilities that have the Vapotherm
2000i device must return all devices to Vapotherm, Inc. Instructions for
return are listed on our recall information website at
<http://www.vtherm.com/recall> or by calling Vapotherm, Inc. at
1-866-827-6843. The "Vapotherm 2000i" label is located on the front of the
device on the lower right-hand corner. If there is a question in
identification of the product please contact Vapotherm for assistance.
This device is used in both the home and in health care institutions for
warming and humidifying breathing gases, such as oxygen, delivered by nasal
cannula.
The firm first learned that patients were colonized by the bacteria from a
Pennsylvania hospital on 17 Aug 2005, and subsequently issued a voluntary
recall of the Vapotherm 2000i on 13 Oct 2005. FDA has since been apprised
of this action.
At this time, the following information is known:
There are numerous reports of _Ralstonia_ colonization, including 3 reports
of infection;
One hospital reported a death, but this has not been confirmed by
Vapotherm; and
26 hospitals in 16 states have reported positive cultures of _Ralstonia_
species from the Vapotherm 2000i device.
Vapotherm's investigation is currently ongoing to identify the source of
the Ralstonia contamination. In the meantime, Vapotherm's plans include
recalling and performing a disinfection process on the units.

Class 1 Recall: Vapotherm, Inc. Vapotherm 2000i and 2000h Respiratory Gas
Humidifier
Date Recall Initiated: 13 Oct 2005
Product: Vapotherm 2000i and 2000h Respiratory Gas Humidifier
Use: The Vapotherm 2000i and 2000h Respiratory Gas Administration delivers
moisture to and warms breathing gases through a flexible nasal tube for
patients receiving supplemental oxygen. The environments of use include
home, hospital or sub-acute institutional settings.
Recalling Firm: Vapotherm, Inc, 108 Log Canoe Circle, Stevensville, MD 21666
Reason for Recall: FDA has received reports of Vapotherm units becoming
contaminated with _Ralstonia_ spp, and other bacteria. Exposure to these
bacteria may cause patients to develop tracheitis (infection of the
trachea), sepsis (infection in the bloodstream), pneumonia (lung
infection), or other serious infections. There is a reasonable probability
that immunocompromised patients or premature newborms could develop
pneumonia, sepsis and in the most severe cases, death.
Public Contact: David Lain, Chief Regulatory Officer Vapotherm, Inc, 198
Log Canoe Circle, Stevensville, MD 21012, 410-604-3977
FDA District: Baltimore
FDA Comments: FDA recommends the use of alternative devices until the
source of the contamination has been identified. In Oct 2005, Vapotherm
issued new procedures for disinfecting the Vapotherm 2000i and 2000h
humidifiers, but these procedures have not been effective in eliminating
Ralstonia spp. contamination in the devices.
Patients who have been exposed to the Vapotherm system should be monitored
for signs and symptoms that may suggest infection, which may include, but
are not limited to changes in temperature; poor feeding; irritability; and
changes in hematologic indices.
Clinicians may want to consider _Ralstonia_ infection in the differential
diagnosis of symptomatic patients even if the organism has not been isolated.
Class I recalls are the most serious type of recall and involve situations
in which there is a reasonable probability that use of the product will
cause serious injury or death.

Health Notification at <http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/safety/122005-vapotherm.html>

[Whether disease was caused by the _Ralstonia_ bacteria in these
individuals is not stated, which suggests that the organism was only
colonizing the respiratory tract of those involved.
The genus includes some organisms that had previously part of
_Pseudomonas_, _Alcaligenes_ and _Cupriavidus_. The genus is also one,
like _Burkholderia_, that contains organisms that may cause human disease
and others that are related to diseases in plants.
_R. pickettii_ has been associated with nosocomial outbreaks caused by
contaminated aqueous solutions as well as "pseudoepidemics" related to
contaminated solutions in a diagnostic laboratory. Other _Ralstonia_
species such as _mannitolilytica_ and _insidiosa_ have also been linked to
human infection (1, 2).
