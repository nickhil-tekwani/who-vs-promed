A 17-year-old Romanian student diagnosed with bacterial meningitis died last week [15 Jun 2017] at the Pediatric Hospital in Brasov, central Romania, while 18 other teenagers were hospitalized with similar symptoms.

The classmates of the young Romanian who died on [15 Jun 2017], as well as other people he came into contact with, were sent to the doctor for consultations. Their number reached 200 by [18 Jun 2017], reports local News.ro.

Moreover, 18 young people were admitted to the Hospital for Infectious Diseases in Brasov, on suspicion of meningitis. One of them was diagnosed with this disease.

Meanwhile, the authorities disinfected the high school where the young boy was a student, as well as the Pediatric Hospital, which doesn't have a department for infectious diseases.

The 17-year-old student who died last week [15 Jun 2017] was from the Tarlungeni commune, in Brasov county. He and his friends had attended a party in the Purcareni village [Brasov county] tone week before. The students started to feel bad after this party.

Meningitis is an inflammation (swelling) of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. A bacterial or viral infection of the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord usually causes the swelling. However, injuries, cancer, certain drugs, and other types of infections can also cause meningitis, according to information posted on the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Meningitis symptoms include sudden onset of fever, headache, and stiff neck, but there are also other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, photophobia (increased sensitivity to light), and altered mental status (confusion).

[The news report above says that one teenage boy has died of bacterial meningitis and 18 of his friends were hospitalized with suspected meningitis; this diagnosis was subsequently confirmed in one. However, the bacterial species that caused the disease is not specified.

Acute bacterial meningitis is a rapidly progressive disease. In a patient with suspected acute bacterial meningitis, blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures will indicate the causative organism and its antibiotic susceptibilities. An empiric intravenous antibiotic regimen that has a spectrum broad enough to cover the most likely bacterial pathogens is started as quickly as possible until the specific bacterial etiology is known. It is vital to begin treatment as early as possible in the course of the disease, as delay may contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality. Adjunctive dexamethasone is also given before or with the 1st antibiotic dose. Once a pathogen is known, the antibiotic regimen can be tailored to the antibiotic susceptibilities of the pathogen.

Common causes of bacterial meningitis vary by age group. Outbreaks of meningitis in the community are often due to _Neisseria meningitidis_. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Brasov is a city with a population of 253 200 residents in Romania and the administrative centre of Brasov County (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brașov).
