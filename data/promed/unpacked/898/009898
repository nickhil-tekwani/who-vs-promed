Hong Kong boy, 6, living in Shenzhen tests positive for H7N9 bird flu virus
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A 6-year-old local boy living in Shenzhen [Guangdong Province] has become the youngest Hongkonger to be infected with the H7N9 bird flu virus. [If he lives in Shenzhen, on the mainland, why do they call him a Hongkonger? Perhaps he was born there. - Mod.JW]

The Centre for Health Protection said the boy developed flu symptoms on 27 Jan 2014 [i.e. in Shenzhen] and was given medicine by his family. He visited Hong Kong the next day [28 Jan] with his mother and 4 relatives. When he returned to Shenzhen that evening, he was found to have a fever. He tested positive for the potentially deadly virus yesterday [1 Feb 2014], according to the centre. His symptoms were said to be mild and his condition stable.

The centre said the boy and other members of the group spent most of their time in Hong Kong shopping and did not meet friends or relatives.

An immigration officer who came into contact with the boy at the Lo Wu checkpoint will be placed under medical surveillance.

A boy entering the Chinese mainland from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has been confirmed as infected with H7N9 bird flu, China's quarantine authority said on Monday [10 Feb 2014].

Infection of the 6-year-old boy, found in the city of Shenzhen across the border from Hong Kong, marks the 1st human H7N9 case for tourists entering the Chinese mainland, said the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine.

The case was 1st noted on 28 Jan 2014 when the boy was diagnosed with a fever of 38.2 C [100 F] and other symptoms such as a red throat and swelling tonsils, confirmed later by the quarantine authorities and disease control center of Guangdong Province.

China has reported more than 120 human H7N9 cases this year [2014], including over 26 deaths, with the provinces of Zhejiang and Guangdong worst affected.

The 10 Feb Xinhua report contradicts the 2 Feb South China Morning Post report. Unfortunately, neither report provides any information on the source of the boy's infection in Shenzhen before visiting the Hong Kong SAR. Further information is awaited. - Mod.CP/JW]
