The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 12 Dec 2018:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 515, of which 467 are confirmed and 48 are probable. In total, there have been 303 deaths (255 confirmed and 48 probable) and 179 people recovered.
- 96 suspected cases are under investigation.
- 10 new confirmed cases have been reported, including 4 in Kyondo, 2 in Mabalako, 2 in Komanda, 1 in Kalunguta and 1 in Beni.
- The new case confirmed in Mabalako, reported in the bulletin of 12 Dec 2018, lives in the health area near Biena, where he began to have symptoms of Ebola. The patient was contaminated by a confirmed case who lived in Aloya City, Mabalako Health Zone, and died at the Ebola treatment center (ETC) on 3 Dec 2018.
- 7 new confirmed case deaths have been reported, including 2 in Kyondo, 2 in Katwa, 1 in Beni, 1 in Mabalako and 1 in Komanda. All are community deaths, except that in Beni.
- 4 new people have recovered, including 3 discharged from the ETC of Beni and 1 from the ETC of Butembo.

News of the response
----------------------
- The youngest patient recovering from Ebola was discharged from the Beni ETC this Wed 12 Dec 2018. This miraculously young child, born 31 Oct 2018, was admitted at the age of 6 days to the ETC after her mother, a confirmed case of Ebola, died during childbirth. Throughout the infant's hospitalization, pediatricians, resuscitators and nannies of ETC took turns at her bedside 24 hours a day to give her every chance to survive. Nannies are former ETC patients who have recovered from Ebola and are able to care for sick children by wearing lighter protective gear. They play a fundamental role in caring for sick children who need more attention and a reassuring presence at their side during treatment.

Vaccination
-----------
- Continued wide-belt vaccination (or ring plus) in Otomaber (in Komanda Health Zone) and Aloya (in Mabalako Health Zone).
- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 45 647 people have been vaccinated, including 18 726 in Beni [North Kivu], 8084 in Katwa [North Kivu], 4950 in Mabalako [North Kivu], 4276 in Butembo [North Kivu], 2108 in Kalunguta [North Kivu], 1663 in Mandima [Ituri], 791 in Vuhovi [North Kivu], 750 in Masereka [North Kivu], 700 in Lubero [North Kivu], 633 in Komanda [Ituri], 627 in Oicha [North Kivu], 599 in Mutwanga [North Kivu], 434 in Bunia [Ituri], 381 in Kyondo [Uganda], 355 in Tchomia [Ituri], 314 in Musienene [North Kivu], 63 in Alimbongo [North Kivu], and 13 in Kisangani [Tshopo].

1. Grab a Kleenex: An infant infected with #Ebola at the beginning of her life has survived the infection. This is truly beating the odds. Mother died giving birth. Admitted to a treatment center at 6 days old. Round-the-clock care. They're calling the miracle of Beni.
2. The rest of today's #Ebola news is more dire. +10 cases today and +7 deaths -- 6 of them community deaths, which means there will likely be a new wave of cases 10 or so days from now. Totals are now 515 cases & 303 deaths.

Wow, this is only the 2nd infant ever documented to have survived #Ebola. Indeed, a near miracle thanks to the efforts of the care team, Tragic that [the] mother died in labor & a deeper tragedy that we yet to have vaccines offered to pregnant women, which may have saved them both!]

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 11 Dec 2018:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 505, of which 457 are confirmed and 48 are probable. In total, there have been 298 deaths (250 confirmed and 48 probable) and 175 people recovered.
- 100 suspected cases are under investigation.
- 5 new confirmed cases have been reported, including 2 in Katwa, 1 in Komanda, 1 in Musienene and 1 in Mabalako.
- 9 new confirmed case deaths have been reported, including 6 in Beni, 1 in Butembo, 1 in Katwa (community deaths) and 1 in Mabalako.
- 3 new people have recovered and been discharged from Butembo ETC.

News of the response
----------------------
- An alert has been raised from the Rutshuru General Referral Hospital in Goma after a patient died in the hospital after presenting bleeding signs. A sample was taken, and the result of the laboratory test was negative.
- Contacts of a confirmed case from Beni traveling to Goma: The surveillance teams in Goma were looking for 6 people -- 3 adults and 3 children -- who had been in contact with a confirmed case from Beni. Before receiving the results of the laboratory tests of their deceased relative in Beni, these 6 contacts had started for Goma, traveling in 2 separate groups. They had to go to relatives living in Mabanga South, a district of Goma. A mother and her 2 children were found at Kanyabayonga on Tue 11 Dec 2018, and agreed to return to Beni to complete their 21-day follow-up period. The 2nd group of travelers, consisting of the other 2 adults with the 3rd child, arrived in South Mabanga on the night of Tue 11 Dec 2018. The child had a fever, and the 3 people were immediately transferred to the Goma ETC to perform the necessary tests. The laboratory test results were negative.

Vaccination
-----------
- Continued wide-belt vaccination (or ring plus) in Otomaber (in Komanda Health Zone) and Aloya (in Mabalako Health Zone).
- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 45 020 people have been vaccinated, 18 638 in Beni [North Kivu], 7765 in Katwa [North Kivu], 4930 in Mabalako [North Kivu], 4276 in Butembo [North Kivu], 2108 in Kalunguta [North Kivu], 1663 in Mandima [Ituri] (see source URL for the complete list).

Sensitization
------------
Beyond the medical arsenal, the Ministry of Health recalls that the response against Ebola is above all community. Since the beginning of the epidemic, the city of Goma is an exposed area in the same way as the cities of Bunia and Kisangani because of the regular displacements of the population between the zones currently affected by the Ebola epidemic and these 3 large urban centers. If all the inhabitants of these cities respect the sanitary measures recommended by the Ministry of Health, it is possible to ensure that, even if an Ebola case arrives in the city, it would be a sporadic case and would not lead to a new outbreak.

As a reminder, the recommendations of the Ministry of Health are as follows:
1. Follow basic hygiene practices, including regular hand washing with soap and water or ashes;
2. If an acquaintance from an epidemic zone comes to visit you and is ill, do not touch them and call directly the North Kivu civil protection hotline;
3. If you are identified as an Ebola patient contact, agree to be vaccinated and followed for 21 days;
4. If a person dies because of Ebola, follow the instructions for safe and dignified burials. It is simply a funeral method that respects funerary customs and traditions while protecting the family and community from Ebola contamination.
5. For all health professionals, observe the hygiene measures in the health centers and declare any patient with symptoms of Ebola (fever, diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, anorexia, bleeding).

1. Everyone is on high alert for #Ebola cases in Butembo & Goma, further south. Big cities, transport hubs. There were fears.
2. So much movement of people in this region. This anecdote from today's @MinSanteRDC update gives a sense of the efforts the #Ebola response team has to go to, to find contacts of cases & monitor them to ensure that if they're sick, they don't infect others.]

[2] Summaries
- Thu 13 Dec 2018. WHO report
[WHO/AFRO, Health Emergencies Programme, Health Emergency Information and Risk Assessment, weekly bulletin on outbreaks and other emergencies, abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/13-December-2018-ebola-drc/en/

The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is occurring in an unforgiving context. Non-engagement from communities and conflict continue to hamper response activities in some affected areas. Moreover, poor infection prevention and control (IPC) practices across numerous private and public health centers remain a major source of amplification of the outbreak and risk to health and other frontline workers.

Despite these challenges, substantial progress has been made on multiple fronts to address the situation, and daily successes are being observed in the implementation of proven public health measures alongside newer tools, such as vaccination and novel therapeutics. Together with the Ministry of Health (MoH) and our partners, WHO is further scaling up our response to the developing situation. WHO especially emphasizes the need to continuously improve quality, judiciously deploy new tools at our disposal, and sustain international commitment to response efforts well into 2019. Nonetheless, we remain confident the outbreak can be brought to a conclusion.

During the reporting period (5 through 11 Dec 2018), 37 new cases were reported from 10 health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces: Katwa and Butembo (18), Beni (7), Mabalako (4), Oicha (3), as well as one case each in Komanda, Kyondo, Mandima, Musienene and Vuhovi. A total of 4 new infections of health workers have been reported in Musienene, Katwa and Butembo health zones. In total, 51 (49 confirmed and 2 probable) health workers have been infected to date, of whom 17 have died. An additional 23 survivors were discharged from ETCs and reintegrated into their communities. A total of 177 patients have recovered to date.

As of 11 Dec [2018], 505 EVD cases (457 confirmed and 48 probable), including 296 deaths, have been reported in 12 health zones in North Kivu Province and 3 health zones in Ituri Province (see Figure 1 at the source URL). These zones represent a mix of densely populated urban areas and remote villages, each bringing a variety of factors driving transmission and posing different challenges.

Trends in case incidence (see Figure 2 at the source URL) reflect the continuation of the outbreak across these geographically dispersed areas, with an average of 33 new cases reported each week since mid-October [2018]. Although there has been a general decrease in the intensity of transmission in Beni in recent weeks, the outbreak is intensifying in Butembo and Katwa, and new clusters are emerging elsewhere. At present, the situation remains concerning.

The very high risk of further geographical spread of the outbreak was highlighted this week by the movement of several contacts of confirmed cases from Beni to Kisangani and Goma. All of these contacts were rapidly traced and have since returned to Beni, where they will complete their 21-day follow-up evaluation. Several alerts of potential cases were also received from Goma, as well as from towns between Goma and Butembo. These individuals were promptly isolated, reported and tested negative for EVD. Preparedness and operational readiness activities in other areas of North Kivu and Ituri provinces, other provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and neighbouring countries must continue to be upscaled to rapidly detect and respond to any potential cases.

1. The latest situation report from @WHOAFRO, as usual, provides interesting glimpses into the challenges the #Ebola response faces. For instance: Safe burial teams are still facing physical threats at times when they try to save people from possible infection.
2. Another thing the #Ebola response is up against: Cases spread over a very large number of health districts. Fires that were extinguished (eg Mandima) are reignited when sick people travel to be cared for by family instead of going into ETCs.
3. Lastly, the other thing that's clear from this week's #Ebola SitRep is that the people working to stop this outbreak are doing an incredible amount of work. Too much work, too few bodies, too long an outbreak. We owe them.]

- Thu 13 Dec 2018. Officials note 10 new Ebola cases as youngest patient recovers
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), edited]

The pace of new Ebola cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) saw no let-up today [13 Dec 2018], with 10 more illnesses reported across 5 locations in the affected area, the country's health ministry said in its latest update.

The 10 new cases push the overall outbreak total to 515 cases, 467 of them confirmed and 48 listed as probable. According to today's [13 Dec 2018] update, the new cases are in Kyondo (4), Mabalako (2), Komanda (2), Kalunguta (1), and Beni (1).

Mabalako was one of the outbreak's early hot spots, and health officials have said they are worried about a resurgence of cases in it and other similar areas. The health ministry said today [13 Dec 2018] that a case-patient in Mabalako yesterday [12 Dec 2018] began having symptoms in his home near Biena, and investigators found that the individual contracted the virus from a patient in Aloya City in Mabalako health zone who died at an ETC on 3 Dec [2018].

In addition, 7 more deaths were reported today [13 Dec 2018], raising the fatality count to 303. The patients who died were from Kyondo, Katwa, Beni, Mabalako, and Komanda. All except the patient in Beni died in the community, a situation known to pose a high risk of disease spread. Investigations continue into 96 suspected Ebola cases.

Meanwhile, the ministry said a baby born on 31 Oct [2018] to a mother with Ebola who died during childbirth is recovering after contracting the virus. The baby, the youngest known person to be infected in the outbreak, was admitted to a treatment center 6 days after birth and was discharged yesterday [12 Dec 2018]. Doctors and other health workers took turns at the baby's bedside 24 hours a day to monitor treatment, the ministry said, adding that care-team nannies are Ebola survivors who can care for sick children while wearing lighter protective gear. "They play a fundamental role in caring for sick children who need more attention and a reassuring presence at their side during treatment," the update said.

In other related Ebola developments, Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, a biotechnology company based in Miami, Florida [USA] today [13 Dec 2018] announced an agreement with the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) to license mAb114, an experimental treatment for Ebola. The drug is a monoclonal antibody that is being used on an emergency, compassionate-use basis to treat Ebola patients in the DCR outbreak. In November [2018], randomized controlled trials of mAb114 and other treatments launched in the country's outbreak region.

The company said in a press release today [13 Dec 2018] that mAb114 has already been through a phase 1 safety study, and preclinical studies in nonhuman primates suggested protection against Ebola with one-dose treatment. In today's [13 Dec 2018] announcement, Ridgeback said the patent license agreement with NIAID covers intellectual property related to mAb114. Wendy Holman, the company's chief executive officer and cofounder, said, "We are thrilled to have partnered with NIAID's Vaccine Research Center (VRC) on mAb114 and will continue the incredible work that the VRC team has done."

She said the company is grateful to the people and groups that have supported mAb114, as well as Ebola treatments and vaccines. "Your efforts have been heroic and will continue to be essential in this fight against a disease which knows no boundaries," she added.

mAb114 was isolated from the blood of a patient who survived an Ebola infection in a 1995 outbreak in the city of Kikwit in the DRC. An NIAID VRC research team led by Nancy Sullivan, PhD, plus collaborators from the DRC, found that the patient still had Ebola antibodies against Ebola 11 years after infection. After isolating and testing the most favorable antibodies in lab and animal studies, they found that mAb114 was the most promising

[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/12/ebola-outbreak-grows-drc-issues-alerts-goma
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

The Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC's) health ministry today [12 Dec 2018] in its daily Ebola update reported 5 new cases and 9 new deaths and added that 100 suspected cases are under investigation. Outbreak totals now stand at 505 cases, including 298 deaths. The new cases include 2 in Katwa and one each in Komanda, Musienene, and Mabalako. At least one of the newly recorded deaths occurred in the community, in Katwa, an event that heightens the risk of virus spread, the DRC said.

Officials also issued 2 health alerts about possible disease spread in Goma, the capital and largest city in North Kivu province. For weeks, officials have warned that Ebola could spread in the city.

The 1st alert came after a bleeding patient died at the Rutshuru General Referral Hospital in Goma, but subsequent tests showed the patient did not have Ebola. The 2nd alert came after 6 family members (3 adults, 3 children) of a case contact in Beni left that city for Goma, avoiding the 21-day surveillance period for case contacts. Yesterday [11 Dec 2018], all 6 people had been found and accounted for, and all have returned to Beni for the remainder of their surveillance period.

The DRC issued a warning to the citizens of Goma, highlighting the need for safe and dignified burials and best hygiene practices. "If all the inhabitants of these cities respect the sanitary measures recommended by the Ministry of Health, it is possible to ensure that, even if an Ebola case arrives in the city, it would be a sporadic case [and] would not lead to a new outbreak," the DRC said.

In other news, UNICEF today raised concerns about the high number of children infected in the outbreak, the world's 2nd largest. According to UNICEF, one of every 3rd person diagnosed in the current Ebola outbreak is a child, a uniquely high number. One in 10 children diagnosed with the virus are under the age of 5 years, and children are more likely to die from their infections than adults.

"We are deeply concerned by the growing number of children confirmed to have contracted Ebola," said UNICEF's Regional Director for West and Central Africa, Marie-Pierre Poirier, in a press release. "The earlier children infected with Ebola receive treatment in a specialized health facility, the greater their chances of survival. Community mobilization and public awareness activities are also crucial to ensuring early detection and quick referral of suspected cases to Ebola treatment centres."

Today [12 Dec 2018] in Science Translational Medicine (Sebba D et al. A point-of-care diagnostic for differentiating Ebola from endemic febrile diseases. Science Translational Medicine 2018;10:eaat0944 http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/471/eaat0944), researchers published promising data on a new point-of-care test that can detect Ebola with 90.0% sensitivity and 97.9% specificity and malaria with 100.0% sensitivity and 99.6% specificity within 30 minutes.

The test uses surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) tags to simultaneously detect antigens from Ebola, Lassa, and malaria within a single blood sample, the study authors said, and could theoretically help clinicians differentiate between those viruses at the onset of a patient's symptoms. This is the 1st test to simultaneously detect these co-infections.

The test was assessed on 190 clinical samples collected from the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak, along with 163 malaria positives and 233 negative controls. The authors of the study said the new test, if developed, is preferable to current Ebola tests for outbreak use.

"Considering that diagnosis of infections such as Ebola come with heightened biosafety concerns, it is beneficial that the SERS assay requires only the addition of blood to a tube that is then closed and tested directly, with no need to reopen the test vial," they said. "Its portability can enable near-patient testing, simplifying the logistics and biosecurity concerns associated with transporting samples for analysis."

Finally today [12 Dec 2018], Peter Salama, MD, the World Health Organization's (WHO's) deputy director-general for emergency preparedness and response, said the organization was working with Merck to identify any possible supply chain gaps. "WHO is working with the supplier of the investigational Ebola vaccine to address potential supply issues in DRC & elsewhere," Salama said on Twitter. "We have not experienced a gap in the vaccine doses required. Supplier is actively working to increase availability of doses to meet evolving needs."

Salama said 48 000 people have received the vaccine in response to the outbreak, including 2000 healthcare workers in the DRC and Uganda. Health workers in South Sudan will also be vaccinated in the coming weeks, he added.

[The new multiplexed point-of-care diagnostic to differentially detect Ebola, Lassa, and malaria infections simultaneously and directly from a whole blood sample is an important advance if it proves accurate and sensitive in the field. Cost also must be considered, as the countries where the test will be most useful are not wealthy. - Mod.LK]

Ebola in the DRC: Expert sets out critical lessons learned in Liberia
[Medical Press, abridged, edited]
https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-12-ebola-drc-expert-critical-lessons.html
[Byline: Mosoka Fallah]

What can you tell us about the spread of Ebola in the DRC?

The situation is very serious. I think it could be a matter of days before DRC's epidemic spreads to more urban centres or spills over into neighbouring countries. I say this because of how the outbreak is unfolding.

First, health care workers are being infected. In our experience in Liberia, and in most outbreaks, infected health care workers can be super spreaders. They can infect the people they treat or those taking care of the sick.

Second, there are now cases (live and dead) reported in communities that were not on the contact list. This is a list of people who may have come into contact with an infected person. If there are people that are infected who were not on the list, it means that proper tracking is not happening. It also implies that people do not trust, or are afraid of, the Ebola response and are turning to home treatments, including traditional remedies or prayers. These could expose a larger population to infection.

To contain an Ebola outbreak, it is crucial that 100% of the contact list is documented and tracked. If this is broken, then a spread should be expected.

Why has the country been unable to contain the spread this time round?

The failure to control this outbreak is due to a variety of factors. Because of the civil war and with huge numbers of people living in abject poverty -- as was the case in Liberia -- there is widespread distrust in the government and its institutions. This means it will be hard for people to trust the Ebola response team.

This is a major problem because Ebola containment is based on trust. Response workers can't be in every house and so they rely on individuals in communities to alert them. But if they're not trusted, cases won't be reported. Mistrust can also lead to violence -- as we've seen in the frequent attacks against response workers in the DRC. These attacks delay response when speed is critical.

These reactions are because the Ebola response goes against the normal tendency for families and friends to take care of their sick. Instead they are isolated and kept away. To help people accept this requires them to trust the health workers. People who are very poor, and have been neglected by the state, don't trust the authorities. And they aren't likely to accept the radical changes required. This, in turn, results in resistance and violence.

What steps need to be taken immediately?

The 1st steps must be to address some of the fundamental needs of the people. For example, at-risk communities should be provided with food and useful tools and services -- like water pumps and functional clinics. But these must be distributed through locally trusted leaders.

Second, some of the Ebola response must go to the local community. The 1st step would be to identify key trusted leaders who can lead the response. They can also be invited to propose solutions, and be supported in getting these implemented. In addition, local youths and religious and traditional leaders need to drawn in and paid to do active surveillance and community sensitisation. They must share the resources (financial and logistics) in the Ebola response.

What lessons are there from Liberia?

The one big difference is that there's an active war on in the DRC. Apart from that, however, there are some clear parallels between the outbreak in Liberia and this one.

The 1st case of Ebola in Liberia was reported in March 2014. Then 5 months later, we accounted for 51% of all cases in West Africa -- it had spread across Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. But we shifted the epidemic curve and, in September 2015, became the 1st country in the region to be declared Ebola free.

This was because of our work with the community. I cofounded the community-based initiative with support from the Ministry of Health, the United Nations Development Fund and the World Health Organisation. We were advocates for the communities and got support to them quickly and efficiently. We held daily meetings with national response workers and international partners organised under the national emergency operation centre.

These are the steps we took:
- We engaged local communities in meetings to allow them to express their concerns and propose solutions.
- We then asked them to map out all the households in their communities and recruited members of the community to cover 40 households. They would need to pass on messages, search for the sick, the dead and visitors. This information would then be passed on to us.
- Local community chairs were given visitor log books. This allowed us to see where visitors came from and if they were at risk.
- Precautionary observation was encouraged. Here those who could be infected stayed home and restricted their movement for 21 days. During this time they were provided with food and comforts -- like electricity.
- A mobile app was deployed on the phones of community members who reported cases of infection or death to us. This allowed us to analyse and respond quickly.
- Culturally sensitive burial teams -- for example, observing Muslim traditions -- were developed and rolled out.
- We recruited more than 5700 community members. By the end of the response they had earned nearly LRD 3 million (USD 19 000) for their daily work.
- Many of these steps could be replicated. But time is of the essence.
