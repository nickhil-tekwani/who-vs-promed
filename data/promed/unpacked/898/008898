On Friday [21 Apr 2012], the head of epidemiology of the Beni Department [state equivalent] Health Services (SEDES), Wilfredo Camargo, reported the death of another person from hemorrhagic fever in this Amazon region. "This is a confirmed case of hemorrhagic fever; the patient died on Thursday [19 Apr 2012]. He came from the Campo Verde ranch in the San Ramon municipality," he indicated.

The [health] authority added also that another person with this disease arrived in Trinidad [Beni province] from the San Silvestre ranch, also in the San Ramon municipality, near the Negro and Machupo Rivers, where the mouse that transmits the disease [virus] proliferates. He said that this other case with the disease symptoms is an inpatient in the San Ramon Hospital.

Camargo explained that the contingency plan that had been expected to be executed was cancelled due to lack of financial resources, and due to this, is was foreseen that the Center for Emergency Operations worked for at least 30 days in this area.

So far this year [2012], 3 people in Beni died of hemorrhagic fever and there are 50 suspected cases.

[This appears to be a continuation of the outbreak in Beni department that began at the end of November last year (2011) (see ProMED-mail archive nos. 20111202.3514 and 20120129.1025260). It will be interesting to learn how many of the 50 suspected cases of Bolivian hemorrhagic fever mentioned above become confirmed. Beni department is endemic for Machupo virus, the etiological agent of Bolivian hemorrhagic fever. Symptoms and epidemiology of Bolivian hemorrhagic fever are presented in ProMED-mail archive no. 20000416.0545. The large vesper mouse can be persistently infected with Machupo virus, a situation common among arenaviruses and their rodent hosts.

Bolivian hemorrhagic fever is caused by Machupo virus, an arenavirus described for the 1st time in 1963 (in Beni, Bolivia), the reservoir of which is _Calomys callosus_. Transmission in most cases is via the respiratory route (through aerosols) and generally occursi in (peri)domestic situations, eventually with small outbreaks.

Clinically, the disease is manifest initially as a febrile picture with non-specific signs and symptoms (myalgia, prostration, abdominal pain, retroorbital pain, facial and conjunctival hyperemia, adenomegaly), later with vesicles and petechiae in the palate developing. With progression of the disease, plasma extravasation (hemoconcentration, hypertension, pulmonary edema), and neurological alterations (motor and cerebral changes, convulsions and coma)appear; the fatality rate varies between 15 - 30 per cent. - Mod.
