[Although the reason for notifying these outbreaks was indicated as "new strain in the country", it is important to note that bluetongue virus (BTV) serotype 2 was already detected in Tunisia in 1999 and 2000.

"From the end of 1999 BTV serotype 2 was present in Tunisia, and by the end of 2000 had been detected in Algeria and Morocco. In mid-2000 BTV serotype 2 was detected in Sardinia and, by the end of the year, had spread to Corsica, the Balearic Islands, Sicily and southern mainland Italy."

The information below is quoted in a research article entitled "A Mini-review of _Culicoides_ (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) fauna and its vectorial role in Tunisia" by Ahmed Tabbabi (2017). This article was published in December 2017 in the Hereditary Genetics. The complete article is available at https://tinyurl.com/y8fpah97.

"_Culicoides imicola_ is considered as the main and the proven vector of bluetongue virus and African horse sickness virus viruses Africa, Middle East, southern Asia, and southern Europe. The 2 pathogens are responsible of devastating diseases in ovine and equidae, respectively. It is important to note that other species including _C. obsoletus_, _C. scoticus_, _C. dewulfi_, and _C. pulicaris_ are considered as known or potential bluetongue virus vectors. In Tunisia, the 1st outbreaks of bluetongue virus (BTV) were identified in 1999 causing a dramatic sanitary and economic crisis in the country. Later, 2 serotypes including BTV-2 and BTV-1 have arisen in 2000 and 2006, respectively. In 1999, the 1st outbreak appeared in eastern Tunisia along the coast. Important morbidity and mortality rates were recorded, reaching 8.35 per cent and 5.5 per cent respectively. One year later, 72 outbreaks affecting 6120 sheep were recorded in eastern and central Tunisia. Vaccination campaigns were undertaken in sheep flocks by veterinary health authorities in order to control the propagation of the disease." - Mod.CRD
