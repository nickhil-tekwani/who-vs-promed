The chikungunya virus has reached the federal capital after Karachi, as the National Institute of Health (NIH) has identified and verified the presence of the virus in a lady who reached Islamabad from Karachi. After receiving the report, the health department officials fumigated the residence of victim S as well as 25 other houses nearby. The victim had reached in Islamabad 3 days ago from Karachi and stated to be a resident of Saudabad, a locality near Malir.

The doctors thoroughly examined her after she complained of fever and severe pain. The blood specimen of the patient was sent to a laboratory of the NIH, and the results came back positive. The health team, consisting of doctors and other paramedical staffs, immediately rushed to the residence of the victim in Sohan.

The NIH had earlier also confirmed the presence of the chikungunya virus in 3 patients whose blood specimen were brought from Karachi.

[Although the number of clinical cases presenting in the Malir area of Karachi (Sindh) has come down over the last week, the likelihood of travelers presenting in other cities with chikungunya is quite high, given the increased traveling within Pakistan during the holiday season. A few indigenous suspected cases presenting from Islamabad region have so far tested negative for chikungunya virus (personal communication). - Mod.UBA
