South Africa (North West): Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Patient Stable
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
A North West province man diagnosed with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever
(CCHF) over the weekend is in a stable condition and is being monitored by
infectious disease specialists, a provincial health department spokesperson
said on Mon 26 [Jan] 2004. The 70-year-old Lichtenburg farmer was admitted
to hospital in Potchefstroom on Fri 23 Jan 2004 and transferred to the
Klerksdorp/Tshepong Hospital shortly afterwards for specialised treatment,
Barba Gaoganediwe said.
The disease, which is transmitted by ticks, has struck at least 12 people
over the last 18 months. "But fortunately we managed to contain [treat?] it
and there were no fatalities," Gaoganediwe said. As an added precaution,
the health department had sent a team out to Lichtenburg to trace people
who may have been in contact with the farmer [and who might have been bitten
by ticks in the same locality -- CCHF is not transmitted person-to-person. -

According to the World Health Organisation, CCHF is a viral haemorrhagic
fever transmitted from animals to humans and is endemic in many countries
in Africa, Europe, and Asia. The disease was first described in the Crimea
in 1944 and given the name Crimean haemorrhagic fever, but in 1969 it was
recognised that the pathogen was the same as that responsible for an
illness identified in 1956 in the Congo, so the place names were linked to
identify the disease.
Described as a "severe disease in humans, with a high mortality rate",
early symptoms include fever, aching muscles, dizziness, neck pain,
stiffness, and sensitivity to light. Gaoganediwe said the patient's
recovery would not be instant. "It takes a long time," he said.
