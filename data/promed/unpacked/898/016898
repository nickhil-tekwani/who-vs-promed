The Department for Public Health said there have been 629 cases with 6 deaths of hepatitis A affecting 10 counties in Kentucky. The outbreak affects Boyd, Bullitt, Carter, Greenup, Hardin, Jefferson, McCracken, Meade, Montgomery and Warren. Each of the counties have reported 4 or more cases of hepatitis A.

On [Thu 24 May 2018], a food service worker was diagnosed in Boyd County.

The affected counties are set to receive funding for 1000 doses of the vaccine each.

Health officials said hepatitis A is a communicable disease of the liver caused by the virus. Most adults experience symptoms of fatigue, low appetite, stomach pain, and nausea that resolve within 1 month of infection. The best way to prevent the infection is to get vaccinated.

[Most of the cases have occurred in the Louisville area. Over the past few weeks, an average of 48 cases per week is an impressive number.

The number of cases of hepatitis A in Kentucky has continued to expand at an impressive rate. It is unclear how many of the cases are included in the, now common, risk group of homeless and illicit drug using adults and how many cases have spilled over into MSMs (men who have sex with men) or related to infected food handlers. An aggressive immunization campaign as well as addressing sanitary issues in the homeless cohort are needed. The number of cases in Kentucky is rapidly increasing and may quickly surpass the number in southeast Michigan. Non-action will, no doubt, result in spillover into other populations. - Mod.LL]

Metro Public Health Department officials announced on [Fri 25 May 2018], details of a hepatitis A outbreak occurring in Nashville.

Health department officials said there have been 14 confirmed cases of acute hepatitis A in Nashville since 1 Dec 2017. The Metro Public Health Department is working with the Tennessee Department of Health on efforts to control the outbreak.

People don't need to look out for anything. This is an outbreak that we can contain if we vaccinate the at-risk populations and we do so quickly," said Brian Haile, CEO, Neighborhood Health.

There has been an average of 2 cases each year in Nashville over the past few years, according to a news release from the health department.

Large hepatitis A outbreaks have been occurring since early 2017 in several other states, including ongoing outbreaks in Kentucky and Indiana, spreading from person to person primarily among people who are homeless and people who use drugs.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), those at greatest risk of exposure to hepatitis A in the current outbreaks include:
- illicit drug users (not just injection drug use);
- men who have sexual contact with men;
- individuals experiencing homelessness.

The health department will be offering free hepatitis A vaccines beginning [Tue 29 May 2018}, at all 3 health centers to those 3 risk groups.

Based on current confirmed cases, the immediate priority includes men who have sexual contact with men and illicit drug users (injection and non-injection).

[The Nashville area of Tennessee appears to be the latest area in the USA to report an outbreak of hepatitis A. Nashville, sometimes called "Music City", is affected which could affect the large tourist industry of the city. As these outbreaks continue to occur, it seems clear that cities should preemptively address their homeless situations before outbreaks begin. Ignoring these marginalized populations is clearly part of the problem. - Mod.LL
