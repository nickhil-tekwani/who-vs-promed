Egypt: Avian Influenza Situation - Update
-----------------------------------------------
As of Wed 27 Dec 2006, the Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population
has informed WHO of 3 new human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1)
virus infection. All 3 cases belong to one extended family in
Gharbiyah province, 80 km northwest of the capital city, Cairo. While
being transferred to and cared for at the country's designated avian
influenza hospital, a 30-year-old female, a 15-year-old girl and a
26-year-old male died. The most recent death occurred on Wed 27 Dec
2006. The cases reportedly had contact with sick poultry (ducks).
Clinical specimens from the 3 cases tested positive for avian
influenza A(H5N1) virus by the Egyptian Central Public Health
Laboratory. The virus was also detected in specimens from 2 of the 3
patients by US Naval Medical Research Unit No. 3 (NAMRU-3) [in
Cairo]. The samples will be sent to the WHO Collaborating Centre for
further testing, including virus characterization.
The Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population is conducting further
investigations and has initiated public health measures. The other
family members remain healthy and have been placed under close observation.
