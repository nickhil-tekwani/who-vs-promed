A deadly disease passed from bobcats to domestic cats through ticks is on the rise.

NewsChannel 5 in Nashville [Tennessee] talked to an area veterinarian, Dr Frankie Locklar of Maury County Animal Hospital in Columbia, about the disease.

"Actually the last 3 years we've seen an uptick [in bobcat fever]," Locklar explained. "Used to, you'd see 1 or 2 cases a summer. Now we're actually starting to see in the 20s."

Bobcat fever is almost always fatal in domestic cats. "It [the lone star tick] injects those organisms into their blood stream, that organism attaches to the red blood cells and causes them to lyse," Locklar explained.

The disease affects every organ in a cat's body; it causes a lot of pain and swelling.

"I'm telling you, straight up we do supportive IVs, we do pain control, fever control, we put them on the medications, we just haven't been successful in turning that around," Locklar said.

Prevention is key for both indoor and outdoor cats, he says. The best way to keep your pets safe and healthy is to use products which keep ticks away.

[This is a horrible disease for cats and is heart breaking for owners. Aggressive tick prevention is critical for outside cats or cats who alternate between indoors and outdoors. Flea protection is also necessary for the cats' protection. If there has been a case of bobcat fever in your area, you are well advised to keep the cat indoors for the duration of the animal's life as this disease will cut that life short.
