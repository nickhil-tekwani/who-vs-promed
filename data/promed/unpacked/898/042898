Jennie-O Turkey Store Sales, LLC recalls raw ground turkey
----------------------------------------------------------
Editor's note: FSIS [United States Department of Agrticulture (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service] and our public health partners, including CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and state public health officials, are investigating a _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Reading outbreak. Please note that FSIS is continuing to investigate illnesses associated with this widespread outbreak, and additional product from other companies may also be recalled. Salmonella is prevalent and can be present in raw poultry and meat -- no raw poultry or meat is sterile. In addition to discarding the product associated with this recall, consumers can protect themselves now and in the future by ALWAYS cooking their turkey, and other poultry products thoroughly, to a safe internal temperature of 165 deg F [74 deg C], as measured using a food thermometer. The cooking process kills the salmonella. No one should be eating partially cooked or raw turkey. Also, it is essential that people wash their hands after handling raw poultry, meat, and pet food to avoid cross contamination.

Jennie-O Turkey Store Sales, LLC, a Barron, Wisconsin establishment, is recalling approximately 91 388 pounds of raw ground turkey products that may be associated with an illness outbreak of _Salmonella_ Reading, FSIS announced today, 15 Nov 2018.

The raw ground turkey products items were produced on 11 Sep 2018.
The following products are subject to recall:
- 1-lb. packages of "Jennie-O ground turkey 93% lean / 7% fat" with "Use by" dates of 10 Jan 2018 and 10 Feb 2018;
- 1-lb. packages of "Jennie-O taco seasoned ground turkey" with a "Use by" date of 10 Feb 2018;
- 1-lb. packages of "Jennie-O ground turkey 85% lean / 15% fat" with a "Use by" date of 10 Feb 2018;
- 1-lb. packages of "Jennie-O Italian seasoned ground turkey" with a "Use by" date of 10 Feb 2018.

The products subject to recall bear establishment number "P-190" inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to retail locations nationwide.

FSIS, and its public health partners, including CDC and the Arizona Department of Health Services, have been conducting traceback activities for a sample of Jennie-O brand ground turkey in an intact, unopened package from a case-patient's home. The patient tested positive for _S._ Reading and the sample from the ground turkey matches the outbreak strain.

FSIS, CDC, and state public health and agriculture partners, have been working together on an illness cluster involving 164 case-patients in 35 states. Patients have reported eating different types and brands of turkey products purchased from many different stores, handling raw turkey pet food and/or raw turkey, or working with live turkeys or living with someone who handled live turkeys. FSIS continues to work with CDC and state health departments on this investigation and will provide updated information as it becomes available. Based on the continuing investigation, additional product from other companies may also be recalled.

Consumption of food contaminated with salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the commonest bacterial foodborne illnesses. The commonest symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. The illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. In some people, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. Older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. Individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider.

FSIS is concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers. Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution lists will be posted on the FSIS website at http://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume raw poultry products that have been cooked to a temperature of 165 deg F [74 deg C]. Safe steps in food handling, cooking, and storage are essential in preventing foodborne illness. You can't see, smell, or taste harmful bacteria that may cause illness. In every step of food preparation, follow the 4 guidelines to keep food safe:
- clean: wash hands and surfaces often;
- separate: separate raw meat from other foods;
- cook: cook to the right temperature;
- chill: refrigerate food promptly.
