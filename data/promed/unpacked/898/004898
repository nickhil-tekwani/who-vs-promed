May I please comment on your recent moderated resume of the distribution of
Akabane virus, to which I feel I can add.
As regards the presence of the virus in the Middle East, there are 2
studies which widen its distribution beyond Israel; at least one outbreak
has been noted in western Turkey [Yonguc AD, Taylor WP, Csontos L, Worral
E. Bluetongue in western Turkey. Vet Rec 1982; 111: 144-6). In addition
there is serological evidence of a widespread distribution in Turkey
(Taylor WP, Mellor PS. Epidemiol Infect 1994; 113: 175-85).
Given that there appear to be extensions to the geographic distribution of
Bluetongue in the Middle East, it is worth pointing out that there may be
similar extensions to the distribution of Akabane.
Regarding the existence of 2 geographical bands, I think there may be a
much wider distribution. Our evidence suggests that the virus is
distributed across a tract that runs from Japan-Australia up through
Malaysia and the Indian sub-continent.
There is also evidence that Akabane occurs in South America. In essence
then, the distribution of Akabane virus is probably in a global equatorial
belt similar to that of Bluetongue, within which most female bovines are
probably infected before their first pregnancy and therefore do not produce
congenitally infected calves. (Taylor WP, Gumm ID, Hussein M. Serological
evidence for the distribution of Akabane virus. Pakistan Journal of
Biological Sciences 2001; 4: 171-2). Congenitally affected calves are found
at the northern and southern extremities of the distribution range, where
the virus does not automatically immunise young dams.

[Dr Taylor's authoritative comment is highly appreciated. In particular,
his remark about the possibility of the Akabane virus distribution area
extending similarly to the recently observed extension of Bluetongue virus
deserves attention. If this happens, considerable numbers of congenital
malformed bovine, ovine, and caprine neonates might be anticipated in the
newly-affected virgin areas, such as southern Europe. - Mod.AS]
