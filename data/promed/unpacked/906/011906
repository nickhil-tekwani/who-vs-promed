Mpelembe records new measles cases
-------------------------------
Mpelembe Secondary School in Kitwe has recorded 3 more suspected measles cases. This brings the number of cases [reported] on Wed 17 Oct 2012 to 53. School principal Margaret Chilando and clinic sister-in-charge Dorothy Bolla confirmed this development yesterday [Mon 22 Oct 2012] in separate interviews. 2 pupils have since been quarantined. Ms Bolla said 2 grade 9 pupils and a girl from the school township were cases recorded yesterday. She said the district health management team had collected samples and taken them to Lusaka [the capital city] for examination. "However, the situation is under control and those isolated are in stable condition," Ms Bolla said.

The school recorded 49 cases of measles on Wednesday last week [17 Oct 2012] thus compelling management to prematurely close non-examination classes.

Measles case reported in Saskatoon Health Region
------------------------------------------
Measles hasn't been seen in the Saskatoon Health Region in the past 15 years, but Thursday 25 Oct 2012 the region is reporting a case of the disease. Parents of infants should check their children's vaccination records, said Julie Kryzanowski, the region's medical health officer.

About one in 4 children younger than 2 are not properly covered by the vaccine because their immunizations are not up to date, she said. "We're at about 76 per cent coverage rate for children under 2 years with 2 doses, so public health will be calling parents of children who are behind with their measles vaccine," Kryzanowski said.

"We've set up extra drop in clinics in Saskatoon and some of the surrounding communities of our health region starting Saturday [27 Oct 2012] and running through next week."

Measles can be quite serious. "If somebody isn't protected by immunization and they are exposed to a case of measles, over 90 per cent will be infected," Kryzanowski said. "Whenever we see a single case of measles we are concerned about the risk of an outbreak because measles is so contagious."

While rare, there are cases seen across the country. "Most of the cases of measles that we do see in Canada are sporadic cases and usually attributed to travel internationally or people coming from overseas to Canada and bringing the measles virus with them."

The case here has been linked to a case in Prince Albert reported last month. The case is a woman lives in one of the more rural areas of the region and began feeling the symptoms 13 Oct 2012 before being diagnosed 16 Oct 2012. The incubation period is between 7 and 21 days, so there is still a week left before the region will know for sure if anyone else was infected.

["Health officials have traced the contacts of the woman to see if anyone she was in touch with began developing symptoms. Currently, no one else is showing signs of measles."

Measles case identified at Woodland Primary School
-------------------------------------------
Woodland Primary School [Cowlitz County, Washington state] is alerting parents and guardians that a student has a case of measles, a highly contagious viral disease. Superintendent Michael Green sent home a letter with students on Thursday [1 Nov 2012] listing the symptoms and the precautions taken by the Woodland School District.

The Cowlitz County Health Department and the district have thoroughly reviewed the immunization history of every student at Woodland Primary School and found 25 students who must be excluded from school due to either not being vaccinated for Mumps, Measles and Rubella (MMR vaccine), or only having one of the 2 required doses.

"We are taking serious precautions to notify everyone of this situation and make you aware of our efforts," Green wrote. "The district is offering a free immunization clinic on Mon 5 Nov 2012, for students who have only had one shot." After receiving shots, a student may return to school, but if symptoms develop despite the shot, the student must stay home.

The child with measles may have been exposed to the virus while on a trip to California, said Hilary Gillette-Walch of the county's health department. The child has not been hospitalized, she said. Green said the district is closely following Health Department guidelines to control measles in the school setting.

Measles signs and symptoms appear 7 to 14 days after exposure to the virus, according to the Mayo Clinic website. They include: fever, dry cough, runny nose, sore throat, inflamed eyes (conjunctivitis), sensitivity to light, tiny white spots with bluish-white centers found inside the mouth on the inner lining of the cheek, and a skin rash made up of large, flat blotches that often flow into one another.

Globally, measles remains one of the leading causes of vaccine-preventable death among children, killing more than 100 000 children in the world each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

In 2000 measles was declared eliminated in the United States, but measles continues to be imported, the CDC said. Last year [2011] there were 222 measles cases reported in the U.S. and 17 measles outbreaks (defined as 3 or more cases linked in time and place).

The last cases of measles in the Cowlitz County were reported in 1999.
