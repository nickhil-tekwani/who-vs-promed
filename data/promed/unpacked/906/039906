Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: following reports of an increase of pig deaths in several districts in North Sumatera, a veterinary inquiry was undertaken and official tests identified the presence of African swine fever. From the investigation results, cases were reported in Dairi District and rapidly spread to 16 out of 34 districts in North Sumatera. Source of infection is inconclusive, however rapid risk assessment shows that transportation of live pigs from another area is and contaminated fomite from an animal handler, vehicle and animal feed play a role in this infection. Disposal of the dead pigs, cleansing, and disinfection are being implemented. Updates will be provided in the weekly reports (scheduled for every Friday) as further information becomes available.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; quarantine; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; zoning; disinfection; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
