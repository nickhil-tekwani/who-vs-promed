"Since last week [week 6 to 12 Mar 2017], an increased number of hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) have been reported from Rawalpindi district, the twin of Islamabad (federal capital of Pakistan). Recently some cases have also been reported in Lahore, the 2nd biggest metropolitan city of Pakistan.

The Health department has been investigating this outbreak internally, but so far, no news has been shared on mass media. The disease is mild and has affected under 5 children of play group and Kindergarten."

[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a self-limiting contagious illness caused commonly by enteroviruses affecting mostly infants and children aged less than 5 years. Numerous non-polio enteroviruses as coxsackie viruses A16, A4, A5, A9, A10, B2 and B5 and enterovirus 71 are associated with HFMD. However, the most common causes are coxsackie virus A16 (CAV 16) and enterovirus 71 (EV 71).

The virus is shed in saliva, sputum, nasal mucus, blister fluid, and feces of an infected person. HFMD is spread from one person to another through close contact, coughing and sneezing, contact with feces and blister fluids, and touching objects or surfaces contaminated with the virus. An infected person is most contagious during the 1st week of illness https://www.cdc.gov/features/handfootmouthdisease/index.html. The incubation period is generally 3 to 5 days. The epidemiological pattern varies by geographical region and climate, but the incidence of infection is higher in the summer and autumn months in temperate climates while remaining prevalent year-round in tropical climates.

HFMD presents as fever, rash on hands and feet, and vesicles in the mouth (known as herpangina), conjunctivitis, encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, acute respiratory problem and myopericarditis. It should be noted that infection with EV 71 may result in complications without producing clinically-evident HFMD. The rash does not itch. The illness is usually mild and resolves spontaneously within 7 to 10 days without any treatment.

HFMD is treated symptomatically as there is no specific treatment or vaccine. Patients should drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. Early diagnosis and isolation is the key to prevent spread of HFMD.

The above information relates to cases from 2 densely populated districts of Punjab Province in Pakistan. While PromedMail is thankful to the anonymous contributor, further information on the epidemiology of the suspected cases and any confirmatory laboratory tests in this regard would be highly appreciated. - Mod.UBA
