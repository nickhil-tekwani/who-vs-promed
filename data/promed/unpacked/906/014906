Young pilgrims coming for Haj or Umrah from polio-hit countries will have
to prove that they have been immunized against the crippling virus,
according to an advisory issued by the Ministry of Health yesterday.
The new directive, which comes ahead of the high Umrah season of Ramadan in
October [2005] and the Haj in January [2006], covers visitors under the age
of 15 from the 19 countries currently reporting polio cases.
Pilgrims in that age group must show valid proof of vaccination in order to
obtain entry visas for the Kingdom. The regulation applies to visitors from
Afghanistan, Angola, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic,
Chad, Ivory Coast, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea, India, Indonesia,
Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sudan and Yemen, a Health Ministry
spokesman said.
The ministry issued the directive in response to an alarming spread of the
virus, the spokesman said, adding that polio immunization for the cited
group is mandatory regardless of previous vaccinations.
The move follows 2 cases imported from Sudan late in 2004 that sparked
fears the virus could spread within the Kingdom or be carried by pilgrims
returning home after the Haj. It was not clear whether the 2 cases were due
to pilgrims or guest workers, but the virus was genetically linked to Sudan.
Polio, which usually affects children under the age of 5, is carried by a
virus and can cause irreversible total paralysis in a matter of hours.
The World Health Organization -- which hoped to halt spread of the disease
by year-end -- welcomed the Saudi initiative, noting that there were large
population movements during the Haj season.
"They (the Saudi authorities) realized they could be part of the solution,"
said Dr. Bruce Aylward, coordinator of the WHO's polio-eradication drive.
Global health experts expressed confidence that the Kingdom would stop the
spread of the virus, even though up to 2 million foreigners converge on the
holy cities in the pilgrimage season.
"Saudi Arabia is not just aiming to protect its own population, but is
further playing a key role in growing international efforts in curbing the
ongoing global spread of the polio virus," WHO spokesman Oliver Rosenbauer
said in Geneva.
According to WHO figures, nearly 96 percent of the 1053 people infected
with polio worldwide so far in 2005 live in member countries of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC).

[While it is unclear if this past year's Haj was actually associated with
wild poliovirus transmission, the above action on the part of the Saudi
Arabian Ministry of Health appears prudent in an attempt to reduce any
further likelihood of transmission during this coming year's Haj. As seen
in the below list of prior ProMED-mail postings (and another posting with
an update on the polio situation in Yemen that will follow this posting,
and therefore has not yet been archived), there has been extensive
transmission of the wild poliovirus in the past 36 months (and recently) in
many countries that are known to have major attendance at the annual Haj in
Saudi Arabia.
Below is a table presenting the most recent statistics (case counts as of
16 Aug 2005) available on the poliomyelitis eradication website
(<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp> :
Country (epidemiologic situation): number of confirmed cases (2005)
Global cases of poliovirus: 1053
Yemen (importation): 415
Nigeria (endemic): 325
Indonesia (importation): 219
Sudan (re-established transmission): 26
India (endemic): 25
Ethiopia (importation): 13
Pakistan (endemic): 12
Angola (importation): 6
Afghanistan (endemic): 4
Mali (importation): 3
Niger (endemic): 2
Chad (re-established transmission): 1
Cameroun (importation): 1
Eritrea (importation): 1
