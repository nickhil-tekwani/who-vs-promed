A rare form of food poisoning most likely caused the deaths of a Queensland mother and daughter in Bali, their family has been told. The woman in her 50s and her teenaged daughter died in January 2014 after falling ill while on holiday. The forensic pathologists who conducted the autopsies in Brisbane have told the family that they do not suspect foul play.

A family member says it is suspected several factors combined to promote the growth of a bacterium in the fish they ate at a restaurant. "At this stage they think the cause of death is the fish... an illness called scombroid poisoning, which is a very unusual type of fish poisoning. It's not very well known," he said and added that they were told it is extremely rare for someone to die from this type of food poisoning.

Both mother and daughter suffered from mild asthma, which could have also contributed to their deaths. The family member added, "They're sort of saying it's just one in millions of chances that [this] could all come together for that to happen with 2 people at the same time." He stressed that the results remain inconclusive and authorities are awaiting final test results.

[Scombroid fish poisoning occurs after eating fish with high levels of accumulated histamine or other biogenic amines. Histamine is produced and can accumulate when bacterial enzymes metabolize naturally occurring histidine in fish, decarboxylating the histidine into histamine. This most often occurs when fish is held at ambient or high temperatures (such as 70 to 90 deg F/21.1 to 32.2 deg C) for several hours, but can occur at more moderate temperatures (over 45 deg F or over 7.2 deg C). Rapid chilling of fish immediately after catch is the most effective measure to prevent scombroid fish poisoning. Fish from the family _Scombridae_ (such as tuna and mackerel) contain high levels of free histidine in muscle tissue and are the commonest sources of scombroid fish poisoning, but other fish (such as mahi mahi (the fish eaten in these cases), amberjack, bluefish, abalone, and sardines) also have been implicated.

The symptoms of scombroid are identical to those of an allergic reaction since the mediator of both are the same, histamine; but in scombroid's case, the histamine is externally produced and not secreted by the affected person's mast cells. The symptoms generally begin 15-60 minutes after ingestion and usually resolve within several hours but may last for 24 hours, rarely longer. Serious cardiac and respiratory complications can occur (1-3) but documented fatalities were not found in the literature by this moderator.

Scombroid poisoning is clearly associated with elevated histamine levels in the implicated vehicles but, as stated by Hungerford in a well-written review on the subject (4), there is not a clear dose-response relationship in the disease and symptoms from the ingestion of the scombrotoxic fish can be higher than an equivalent oral dose of pure histamine.

Drugs such as isoniazid that inhibit the body's histaminases (such as monoamine oxidase and diamine oxidase) will increase symptoms in scombroid (5) although it is not clear that either woman was taking any such medications. Brunner's syndrome, monoamine oxidase-A deficiency, occurs but is linked to aggressive behavior (the Warrior gene) and this behavior was not reported in these women either. If this was indeed fatal scombroid poisoning, some alternative genetic defect in histaminase metabolism could have been present.
