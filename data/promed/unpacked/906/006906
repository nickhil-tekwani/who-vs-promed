I think this is likely to be a very difficult question to answer. The
major problem may be that the most popularly-studied groups of inbred
people--Amish and so forth--have cultural differences (like avoiding
vaccination) that make interpretation of disease frequencies difficult.
However, just to throw a bit of fuel onto the discussion, I'll mention two
papers:
de Campos-Lima PO, Gavioli R, Zhang QJ, Wallace LE, Dolcetti R, Rowe M,
Rickinson AB, Masucci MG. 1993. HLA-A11 epitope loss isolates of
Epstein-Barr virus from a highly A11+ population. Science. 260: 98-100
de Campos-Lima PO, Levitsky V, Brooks J, Lee SP, Hu LF, Rickinson AB,
Masucci MG. 1994. T cell responses and virus evolution: loss of HLA
A11-restricted CTL epitopes in Epstein-Barr virus isolates from highly
A11-positive populations by selective mutation of anchor residues. J.
Exp. Med. 179: 1297-1305
These papers make the claim that the high frequency of HLA-A11 in some
Papua-New Guinea populations has led to the co-evolution of EBV, so that
it no longer contains an otherwise common HLA-A11-restricted epitope.

Note that, as far as I know (which is not, admittedly, very far) neither
EBV nor any other virus is much more virulent in this population; I don't
know what the frequencies of other alleles (i.e. HLA-B and C) are in this
population, and perhaps that makes a difference. Moreover, EBV, being a
persistent virus, may be a special case in this as in so many other things.
