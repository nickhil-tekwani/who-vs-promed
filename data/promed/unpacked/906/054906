On Wednesday [6 Aug 2008], the United States Justice Department
revealed its evidence that Dr. Bruce E. Ivins, on his own, committed
the worst act of bioterrorism in the country's history. This 18-year
veteran scientist of the United States Army Medical Research
Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick in Frederick, Md.,
is accused of killing 5 people and sickening 17 others in the fall of
2001. Dr. Ivins died on 29 Jul 2008 of an apparent suicide without a
chance to give his side of the story.

After reading the affidavits and listening to the Justice Department
briefing, I was both disheartened and perplexed by the lack of
physical evidence supporting a conviction. Dr. Ivins was a friend and
colleague of mine for nearly 16 years. We worked together at Fort
Detrick. He was a senior scientist, and I was, first, a bench
scientist and, from 1999 to 2003, the chief of the bacteriology
division.

The Justice Department has presented different types of evidence to
support its argument that Dr. Ivins was the person who mailed anthrax
to Tom Brokaw, Tom Daschle and others in September and October of
2001. Much of this evidence is outside the realm of science: Dr.
Ivins's alleged fixation with a sorority; strange comments in
excerpts from his e-mail messages; a connection to a Greendale school
that might or might not explain the fictitious return address on
anthrax mailings. I will not address these points beyond noting that
they are highly circumstantial. As a scientist, however, I feel
compelled to comment on what should have been the Federal Bureau of
Investigation's strongest link between Dr. Ivins and the terrible
crime: deadly anthrax spores. In the summary of its findings, the
FBI states that investigators used 4 different genetic techniques
to match the anthrax-laced attack letters to a unique DNA footprint
of a single anthrax spore preparation in one flask that had been in
Dr. Ivins's custody.

Sounds reasonable. Yet the investigators present no details on the
scientific methods they used to make this match or how they employed
them. That's a problem, because without such detail it is hard to
tell if they specifically ruled out a similar match between the
anthrax in the letters and anthrax preparations with the same DNA
footprint kept at a number of other labs around the country. The
basic methods of genetic analysis are well known. Why not provide
enough detail about their procedure to enable other scientists to
tell whether they could actually single out Dr. Ivins's spore
preparation as the culprit?

The investigators fail to address another underlying problem with
their anthrax match: that Dr. Ivins was an investigator in the case
before he was a suspect. After the anthrax attack, Dr. Ivins himself
worked directly with the evidence. The FBI asked Dr. Ivins to help
them with the forensics in the case by analyzing the contents of
suspicious letters. And he did so for years, until the authorities
began to suspect that the anthrax spores used in the mailings might
have originated from his lab.

Dr. Ivins, for instance, was asked to analyze the anthrax envelope
that was sent to Mr. Daschle's office on 9 Oct 2001. When his team
analyzed the powder, they found it to be a startlingly refined
weapons-grade anthrax spore preparation, the likes of which had never
been seen before by personnel at Fort Detrick.

It is extremely improbable that this type of preparation could ever
have been produced at Fort Detrick, certainly not of the grade and
quality found in that envelope.

But even leaving that aside, there are important questions left
unanswered. 1st, isn't it possible that the manipulation of the
contents of the anthrax letters in Dr. Ivins's laboratory might have
contaminated the work environment enough to potentially jeopardize
the integrity of subsequent samples taken from the lab? Might that
perhaps explain why the anthrax powder used in the attacks was later
found to have the same DNA footprint as the other anthrax
preparations in Dr. Ivins's lab? At the very least, wouldn't this
call his guilt into doubt?

It was as if a gun used in a murder was unintentionally returned to
the scene of the crime several days after the murder. What are the
legal implications of such a possibility? Wouldn't a court be
especially cautious in considering evidence involving a weapon in
such circumstances?

This case is apparently closed with Dr. Ivins's death. But until the
FBI discloses its scientific testing methods and data, many
questions will remain unanswered.

When Perry Mikesell, a microbiologist in Ohio, came under suspicion
as the anthrax attacker, he began drinking heavily, family members
say, and soon died. After a doctor in New York drew the interest of
the FBI, his marriage fell apart and his practice suffered, his
lawyer says. And after 2 Pakistani brothers in Pennsylvania were
briefly under scrutiny, they eventually had to leave the country to
find work.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation's path to Bruce E. Ivins, the
Army scientist who committed suicide late last month as federal
officials moved closer to indicting him for the 2001 anthrax letter
attacks, was long and tortuous. Before the investigators settled on
Dr. Ivins -- and his defenders still say the FBI hounded an
innocent man to death -- they had focused on Steven J. Hatfill,
another Army researcher, for several years. But along the way, scores
of others -- terrorists, foreigners, academic researchers, biowarfare
specialists and an elite group of Army scientists working behind high
fences and barbed wire -- drew the interest of the investigators. For
some of them the cost was high: lost jobs, canceled visas, broken
marriages, frayed friendships.

At the Army biodefense laboratory in Frederick, Md., where Dr. Ivins
worked, the inquiry became a murder mystery, the cast composed of top
scientists eyeing one another warily over vials of lethal pathogens.
"It was not pleasant," recalled Jeffrey J. Adamovicz, a former
official there. "There was a general sense of paranoia that they were
going to get somebody no matter what."

Some critics fault the FBI's investigation as ignorant,
incompetent and worse. Representative Rush D. Holt, a New Jersey
Democrat who was a Princeton University physicist, said that the
disclosures linking Dr. Ivins to the crime notwithstanding, the
inquiry was "poorly handled" and "resulted in a trail of
embarrassment and personal tragedy."

The bureau's defenders, though, say it did what was necessary to
track down a dangerous killer. "You do the best you can, and it's not
always pretty," said Robert M. Blitzer, a former director of the
FBI's section on domestic terrorism. "Here you have a bunch of
people dead and several diminished, and you're charged with solving
the crime. You try not to step on people's toes, but sometimes it
happens."

Over 7 years, the anthrax investigators conducted nearly 100 searches
and more than 9000 interviews in the most complex criminal case in
bureau history. They hunted an attacker who, in September and October
2001, had mailed anthrax-laden envelopes that killed 5 people,
sickened 17 others and threw the nation into a panic. Early on, with
more zeal than solid information, agents turned on 3 Pakistani-born
city officials in Chester, Pa. One, Dr. Irshad Shaikh, was the health
commissioner; his brother, Dr. Masood Shaikh, ran the lead-abatement
program. The 3rd, Asif Kazi, was then an accountant in the finance
department. Mr. Kazi was sitting in his City Hall office one day in
November 2001 when FBI agents burst in and began a barrage of
questions. "It was really scary," Mr. Kazi recalled in an interview
last week. "It was: 'What do you think of 9/11? What do know about
anthrax?' "

Across town, an agent pointed a gun through an open window at Mr.
Kazi's home while others knocked down the front door as his wife was
cooking in the kitchen. At the Shaikh brothers' house, agents in
bioprotection suits began hunting for germ-making equipment and
carted away computers. None of the 3 men had ever worked with
anthrax. But for days, they were on national television as footage of
the searches ran on a video loop and news announcers wondered aloud
if they were the killers. The men were cleared after it turned out
that a disgruntled employee had sought revenge by calling in a bogus
tip. But for all 3, trouble followed. The Shaikhs' path to
citizenship was disrupted, their visas ran out and both had to find
work abroad, Mr. Kazi said.

Mr. Kazi, already a citizen, was searched and interrogated for as
long as 2 hours every time he traveled back from visiting his brother
in Canada. Only about a year ago was his name removed from a watch
list, allowing him to travel freely. When Mr. Kazi heard that Dr.
Ivins was said to be the culprit in the attacks, he had only one
request. "We'd just like our names cleared," Mr. Kazi said. "There's
no problem for people who know us. But out in the community, someone
might still think, 'Maybe these guys were guilty.'"

In late 2001, agents discovered that the germ used in the attacks was
not foreign in origin but a domestic strain. That prompted the FBI
to focus mainly on scientists inside the United States. Casting a
wide net, the bureau sent a letter to the 30 000 members of the
American Society for Microbiology. "It is very likely," it said,
"that one or more of you know" the attacker.

The bureau began looking at biodefense insiders like Mr. Mikesell, an
anthrax specialist who had worked in the 1980s and 1990s with Dr.
Ivins at the Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases
at Fort Detrick, in Frederick. He had then joined Battelle, a
military contractor in Columbus, Ohio, who became deeply involved in
secret federal research on biological weapons. In 2002, Mr. Mikesell
came under FBI scrutiny, officials familiar with the case said. He
began drinking heavily -- a 5th of hard liquor a day toward the end,
a family member said. "It was a shock that all of a sudden he's a
raging alcoholic," recalled the relative, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity because of family sensitivities. By late October 2002,
Mr. Mikesell, 54, was dead, his short obituary in The Columbus
Dispatch making no mention of his work with anthrax or the
investigation. "He drank himself to death," the relative said.

Dr. Hatfill, who worked at Fort Detrick from 1997 to 1999, also drew
the investigators' attention. He loved covert exploits and padded his
resume, habits that intrigued F.B.I. agents and, not long after that,
reporters. In June 2002, officials tipped off television stations
that the bureau would search Dr. Hatfill's apartment, just outside
the gates to Fort Detrick. Later, F.B.I. agents told the woman he was
living with at the time that he was a murderer and warned that she
could be charged as an accomplice if she failed to tell all. At a
teary press conference in August 2002, Dr. Hatfill protested his
innocence. For at least a year, F.B.I. surveillance teams followed
him everywhere, and in one remarkable encounter, a car that was
trailing him ran over his foot. (Dr. Hatfill, not the agent, was
given a ticket.) But there was no arrest, and Dr. Hatfill, who said
his career was ruined, fought back, filing a series of lawsuits,
including against The New York Times. In June [2008], long after the hunt
had been narrowed to Dr. Ivins, the government agreed to pay Dr.
Hatfill USD 4.6 million. On Friday [8 Aug 2008], the Justice
Department issued a
statement exonerating him.

Another casualty was Kenneth M. Berry, an emergency room physician
with a strong interest in bioterrorism threats. In August 2004,
agents raided his colonial-style home and his former apartment in
Wellsville, a village in western New York, as well as his parents'
beach house on the Jersey Shore. In scenes replayed for days on local
television stations, the authorities cordoned off streets as agents
in protective suits emerged from the dwellings with computers and
bags of papers, mail and books. "He was devastated," Clifford E.
Lazzaro, Dr. Berry's lawyer at the time, said in an interview. "They
destroyed his marriage and destroyed him professionally for a time."

By 2005, thanks to new genetic testing, the F.B.I. had traced the
anthrax in the letters to a single flask at Fort Detrick. Dr. Ivins
had created and controlled the batch of deadly germs. But more than
100 scientists potentially had access to the pathogens.

For decades, the researchers of Fort Detrick had worked to build
defenses against deadly germs used in war, mainly by creating new
vaccines. They considered themselves patriots. In the early days of
the anthrax investigation, the experts -- including Dr. Ivins --
threw themselves into helping the F.B.I., working around the clock.

Increasingly, though, the scientists found themselves viewed as
potential culprits in the nation's worst case of bioterrorism.

Dr. Adamovicz, the former Fort Detrick official, said the
bacteriological division, which eventually had about 100 people
including technicians and assistants, was like a family. But the
growing air of mutual suspicion caused conversations to become
stilted, even as some scientists became increasingly agitated and
isolated from friends and colleagues. "It became a game to talk in
platitudes without mentioning the specifics," Dr. Adamovicz said.
"You had to."

A least a dozen members of the division eventually were called to
testify before a grand jury. "We were unclear on whether we were all
suspects or whether there were specific suspects," Dr. Adamovicz
recalled. The air of growing distrust ended some relationships. At
one point, Dr. Ivins was advised by his lawyer to stop speaking with
Henry S. Heine, an anthrax colleague. Dr. Ivins was led to believe
that Dr. Heine might have raised questions about him. "They implied
that Hank was pointing the finger at him," recalled W. Russell Byrne,
a retired Army doctor who once supervised Dr. Ivins. "They told Bruce
that 'Hank Heine is not your friend.' Then Bruce's lawyer told him
not to talk to Hank anymore."

And even Dr. Ivins, according to court documents, began pointing his
finger at specific colleagues as suspects.

Dr. Byrne, who did not know of Dr. Ivins's history of deep
psychological problems that was disclosed by federal officials last
week, said he could see signs of the growing stress Dr. Ivins was
under as the investigation seemed to focus on him. One day, in March
2008, he showed up for a Sunday church service with a black eye. "The
F.B.I. been roughing you up?" Dr. Byrne recalled joking.

Last month, Dr. Ivins told an Army colleague that his experience of
F.B.I. pressure was similar to what Mr. Mikesell went through. "Perry
drank himself to death," the colleague recalled Dr. Ivins as saying
some 2 weeks before he killed himself.

Federal officials say they are confident Dr. Ivins was responsible
for the anthrax attacks, even if his suicide means their case will
not be proved in court. And they reject criticism from lawmakers and
others about the conduct of the investigation and express no regret
about those who were caught up in it. The F.B.I. director, Robert S.
Mueller III, in his 1st public comments since the presentation of the
evidence against Dr. Ivins on Wednesday, said Friday that he was
proud of the inquiry. "I do not apologize for any aspect of the
investigation," he told reporters. It is erroneous, he added, "to say
there were mistakes."
