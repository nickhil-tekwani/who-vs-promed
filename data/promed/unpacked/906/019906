Chemical weapons attacks have killed hundreds on the outskirts of Damascus, Syrian opposition activists say. Rockets with toxic agents were launched at the suburbs of the Ghouta region early on Wednesday [21 Aug 2013] as part of a major bombardment on rebel forces, they say.

The Syrian army says the accusations have been fabricated to cover up rebel losses.

The main opposition alliance said that more than 1000 people were killed by the attacks. Activist networks also reported death tolls in the hundreds, but these could not be independently confirmed.

It is also not clear how many died in the bombardment of the sites and how many deaths were due to any exposure to toxic substances.

Images showed dozens of bodies with no visible signs of injuries, including small children, laid out on the floor of a clinic.

Ghazwan Bwidany, a doctor treating the injured, told the BBC the main symptom, especially among children, was suffocation, as well as salivating and blurred vision. "There are some kind of symptoms that tell us that this is phosphorus, which is a chemical weapon. It may be sarin, most probably it's sarin. We don't have the capability to treat this number of people," he said. "We're putting them in mosques, in schools. We are lacking medical supplies now, especially atropine, which is the antidote for chemical weapons."

In a statement, the army described the accusations of chemical weapons use as grave, and stressed the military's right to fight what it described as terrorism in Syria. It accused the opposition of fabricating the accusations to divert attention from the huge losses its forces had suffered recently.

UK Foreign Secretary William Hague and French President Francois Hollande called for UN inspectors to be allowed access to the area and said Britain and France would raise the issue at the UN.

If confirmed, the attacks would mark a "shocking escalation in the use of chemical weapons in Syria," Mr Hague said.

The Arab League echoed the call for the inspectors to go to the site, while Saudi Arabia called for the UN Security Council to convene immediately to discuss the matter.

Two things stand out immediately in this reported Syrian attack.

Firstly, the timing is odd, bordering on suspicious. Why would the Assad government, which has recently been retaking ground from the rebels, carry out a chemical attack while UN weapons inspectors are in the country?

But secondly, the scale of the apparent casualties is far worse than any of the previous alleged chemical attacks. Experts say it would be almost impossible to fake so many dead and injured, including children and babies. They bear no visible wounds from gunshots; instead, many display the classic symptoms of a nerve agent attack, with startled, frozen expressions that experts say are reminiscent of Saddam Hussein's 1988 attack on the Kurds at Halabja.

Last year [2012] a senior Syrian defector told me in Qatar that the Assad government would not hesitate to use chemical weapons if it wanted to. However, today it denies any guilt and instead says this is a media campaign by its enemies.

[There is a parallel report by The Telegraph at http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10256236/Syrian-opposition-claims-1300-killed-in-chemical-attack.html

Unvalidated videos can be seen at http://bambuser.com/v/3832579 and at http://www.youtube.com/user/SaqbaRevo0.

On Sun 18 Aug 2013, a 20-strong team of UN observers arrived in Damascus after the Syrian government agreed to allow them to inspect 3 locations where the use of chemical weapons has been alleged. The United Nations says it has received up to 13 reports of chemical weapons use in Syria, primarily from the United States, France, and Britain, but also from the Assad government itself. The use of chemical weapons is a hot button issue as Washington has marked it out as a "red line" in the conflict. In June 2013, the Obama administration moved to send military support to Syrian rebels after declaring that the Assad government had used chemical weapons on opponents "multiple times".

Recent claims of "chemical weapon attacks" include:
- Khan al-Assal, 19 Mar 2013: Syrian state media accuse rebels of killing 31 people with rockets containing "chemical materials". Rebels blame the army for the attack.
- Al-Otaybeh, 19 Mar 2013: opposition activists allege an attack in which 6 people are reported dead, apparently in reprisal for gains made by rebel forces.
- Adra, 24 Mar 2013: the LCC (Local Coordination Committees of Syria] activist network say 2 people are killed in an attack.
- Sheikh Maqsoud, Aleppo, 13 Apr 2013: at least 3 people are killed in an attack; internet footage of the victims shows symptoms consistent with exposure to nerve gas.
Saraqeb, 29 Apr 2013: eyewitnesses say canisters containing a poisonous gas are dropped from a helicopter above the town. 8 people are injured, one of whom later dies.

Claims are one thing, reality is something else and calls upon very careful expert verification. See http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22318636. Any and all samples taken must be properly documented with secure ownership at all stages, and carefully and appropriately packaged. - Mod.MHJ]

[The news media is reporting DILATED eyes. Nerve agents, regardless of what kind they are, sarin (also known as GB), soman, VX, or others cause PINPOINT pupils. So, either someone does not know what they are observing, or someone has mixed it up in the reporting. In a video posted on the web, I clearly observed at least 2 victims with DILATED pupils and 2 with PIN-POINT pupils. This is possibly a mixed agent. Or some patients with varying stages of poisoning are being treated.

Sarin is a clear, tasteless, colorless, odorless liquid in pure form. It may be released as a vapor and spread rapidly into the environment. Sarin was originally developed as a pesticide in Germany, functioning much like an organophosphate insecticide, with similar clinical signs after exposure. Many organophosphate pesticides are regarded as nerve agents because of their profound effects on the nervous system.

When released as a gas, sarin is heavier than air and will settle into low lying areas, constituting a greater exposure hazard. As gas or vapor it may cling to the clothes of people and continue to off-gas for some time. Vapor is also harmful to exposed skin and to mucus membranes, especially those of the eyes.

Exposure may not be noticed as sarin is odorless, tasteless, and water soluble. Consequently exposure may occur by inhalation, ingestion of contaminated food or water, or by touching contaminated surfaces. Symptoms may begin within seconds to hours as the amount of exposure will influence the time to clinical signs.

Clinical signs of sarin exposure may be similar to those of other intoxications. Signs of organophosphate and of sarin poisoning include runny nose, lacrimation, eye pain, blurred vision, and pinpoint pupils. Other signs include excessive sweating, drooling, coughing, and tightness of the chest, rapid breathing, either a slow or fast heart rate, low or high blood pressure, weakness, headache, confusion, vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, increased urination, muscle twitching, and even convulsions. There may be loss of consciousness with high dose exposure, convulsions, paralysis, and respiratory arrest leading to death.

Sarin blocks the acetylcholine esterase, the enzyme needed to stop the nerve activation. Consequently the continuous activation of the nerves presents with these clinical signs.

Atropine and pralidoxime chloride (2-PAM Cl) are antidotes for nerve agent toxicity; however, to be effective, 2-PAM Cl must be administered within minutes to a few hours (depending on the agent) following exposure. There is also generally no benefit from giving more than 3 injections of 2-PAM Cl. Atropine should be administered every 5 to 10 minutes until secretions begin to dry up.

Phosphorous would most likely be phosphine gas. Phosphine is acutely toxic and exposure to high levels causes immediate effects. Early symptoms of acute phosphine or phosphide exposure are non-specific and include respiratory problems, cough, headaches, dizziness, numbness, general fatigue and gastrointestinal disturbance (pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea). Effects of exposure to higher levels of phosphine include pulmonary edema, convulsions, damage to the kidney, liver, and heart, and death.

There are still mixed signals and insufficient information to provide a better hypothesis of agents used on these people.
