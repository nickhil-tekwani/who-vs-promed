Avian influenza in Japan (Immediate notification report)
-------------------------------------------------
Information received on 27 Jun 2005 from Dr Hirofumi Kugita, Chief
Veterinary Officer, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries,
Tokyo:

Report date: 27 Jun 2005.

Precise identification of agent: low pathogenic avian influenza
(LPAI) virus type H5N2. [see comment].
Date of first confirmation of the event: 26 Jun 2005.
Date of start of the event: 24 Jun 2005.
Clinical disease: yes.
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory.

Details of outbreak:
First administrative division: Ibaraki prefecture
Lower administrative division: Mitsukaido city [the text on the OIE
web-site includes a link to a detailed map. - Mod.AS]
Type of epidemiological unit: farm
Date of start of the outbreak: 24 Jun 2005
Species: avi

Number of animals in the outbreak:
susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
25 000 / ... /... /... /...

Diagnosis: from April 2005, fowls in the affected premises showed a
decrease in laying rate and a slight increase in the mortality rate.
Subsequently, several tests for specific bacteriological and viral
diseases were conducted in a private laboratory. The laboratory
detected the possibility of AI virus infection, and notified the
relevant veterinary authority on 24 Jun 2005. National reference
laboratories, National Institute of Animal Health, identified LPNAI
virus (H5N2) on 26 Jun.

Laboratory where diagnosis was made: National Institute of Animal Health.

Diagnostic tests used: virus isolation
Date: 26 Jun 2005
Results: positive

Source of outbreak or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
(contact with wild birds ?).

Control measures

A. Undertaken:
- movement control of live birds including fowls on farms within a
radius of 5 km;
- zoning;
- disinfection of infected premises.

B. To be undertaken:
- stamping out (all chickens within the affected premises are going
to be destroyed);
- on-site investigations on farms within a 5-km radius of the affected farm.

Vaccination prohibited: yes.

Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: Changes in the
obligations of the OIE Member Countries to notify avian influenza
("notifiable avian influenza"), as adopted during the 73rd OIE
General Session in May 2005, will enter into effect in Jan 2006. The
OIE Animal Health Information Department publishes the information
above because of the importance of monitoring the disease situation
in South-East Asia.

[Though clinical evidence from the field, as described, indicate low
pathogenicity, it will be helpful to obtain data on the laboratory
method used to determine/confirm the (low) pathogenicity of the
current causative H5 avian influenza virus strain. According to
CHAPTER 2.1.14. in OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for
Terrestrial Animals, the following criteria are required for the
assessment of pathogenicity of any H5 isolate:

1. Any influenza virus that is lethal for 6, 7, or 8 of 8 4-to-8
week-old susceptible chickens within 10 days following intravenous
inoculation with 0.2 ml of a 1/10 dilution of a bacteria-free,
infective allantoic fluid.

2. For all H5 and H7 viruses of low pathogenicity and for other
influenza viruses, if growth is observed in cell culture without
trypsin, the amino acid sequence of the connecting peptide of the
haemagglutinin must be determined. If the sequence is similar to that
observed for other HPAI isolates, the isolate being tested will be
considered to be highly pathogenic. - Mod.AS]
