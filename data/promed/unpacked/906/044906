The 3rd hantavirus pulmonary syndrome was confirmed, with positive PCR and ELISA tests, in the Bio Bio region this [Fri 15 Mar 2019]. The case is a 57 year old man, resident of the Arauco province, according to indications by the Bio Bio Health SEREMI [Regional Health Ministerial Secretariat].

"The patient was 1st seen in the SAPU Eleuterio Ramírez on [10 Mar 2019], later taken to the Curanilahue Hospital, and on [14 Mar 2019] was taken to the Guillermo Grant Benavente Hospital. There he was connected to mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal oxygenation as well as given hyperimmune human serum; he is in stable condition," said the Bio Bio Health SEREMI Hector Munoz.

Health authorities, by means of a team composed by professionals of Occupational Health, Zoonoses and Epidemiology of the Arauco government, carried out an environmental investigation to determine risk factors. They concluded that there was high risk of acquiring the infectious [virus] in a load of wood that took place in January and February [2019] in properties of the Pocuno sector of the Canete community. The place met the characteristics of shelter, food and access to water for the rodent [reservoir host]. Given this, public health education was delivered to the property owner and workers, which is also planned to be delivered to other properties in the sector to increase awareness.

That the 1st case of hantavirus [infection] in the region was to a 28 year old man, resident of the Araucanía region, but who became infected while working in the Quilaco community in the Bio Bio province. The 2nd case was a 24 year old man, resident of Los Alamos, but had been infected in a rural sector of the Santa Juana community of the Concepcion province.

In 2018, considering Nuble as part of the Bio Bio region, there were 8 cases of hantavirus [infection] with (4 in Nuble, 1 in Arauco and 4 in the Bio Bio province), which is less than the 12 cases of the median of 5 year period (2014-2018) and than the 18 cases registered in the region during 2017.

The same as last year [2018], so far in 2019 there have been no fatalities registered due to the disease, while in 2017, there were 7 deaths with a case fatality rate of 39%.

At the national level [in 2019], a total of 21 hantavirus [infection] cases are registered with 6 fatalities (case fatality rate of 29%).

Hyperimmune plasma [administration]

In 2018, nationally 24 people were transfused, 3 were discarded as hantavirus [infections] and 2 died. Of all the people where were transfused, 7 were from the Bio Bio region without registered fatalities. During the current year (2019), 12 people have received hyperimmune plasma in the country and on 3 have ended in death.

[As noted in previous comments, much of central and southern Chile, including the Bio Bio region, is endemic for Andes hantavirus. The report above provides limited information about the circumstances under which the man acquired his hantavirus infection, but it may have been due to exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta while in contact with the loads of wood or elsewhere in his environment where rodents were present. Cases of human hantavirus infections occur fairly frequently in the endemic region.

Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. In Chile, Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person; only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.
