Situation overview
------------------
The Ministry of Health in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, WHO, and partners are responding to an Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak since 1 Aug 2018, with the epicentre being Mangina town in Mabalako health zone, North Kivu province, in the east of the country. Confirmed cases have also been reported from Beni health zone (North Kivu province) and Mandima health zone (Ituri province).

Since our last situation report on 14 Aug 2018 (External situation report 02; [see archive no. 20180815.5966397]), an additional 45 new confirmed EVD cases and 18 new deaths have been reported. 9 other suspected cases are under investigation to confirm or exclude EVD. By 20 Aug 2018, 39 case-patients were admitted in Ebola treatment centres (ETCs) in Mabalako (36) and Beni (3).

As of 20 Aug 2018, a total of 102 [MoH report states 103] confirmed and probable EVD cases, including 59 deaths, have been reported. Of the 102 cases, 75 are confirmed [MoH report states 76] and 27 are probable. Of the 59 deaths, 32 occurred in confirmed cases and 27 remain probable. A total of 13 cases have been reported among health workers, of which, 12 are confirmed and one has died. Since the onset of the outbreak, a total of 10 case-patients have recovered from the disease and were discharged and re-integrated into their communities. Among the 88 cases out of the 102 confirmed and probable cases for which age and sex are known, the median age was 32 years (age range: 0-74), with the age group 30-39 being most affected, accounting for 28 percent (25/88) cases. Women accounted for 58 percent (51/88) of all cases.

The epicentre of the outbreak remains Mabalako health zone in North Kivu province, reporting 80 percent (82) of all cases, including 61 confirmed and 21 probable cases. Additionally, 4 other health zones in North Kivu province and one in Ituri province have reported confirmed and probable cases (Table 1 -- Confirmed, probable and suspected Ebola virus disease cases by health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, as of 20 Aug 2018 [available at the source URL above]).

As of 20 Aug 2018, a total of 2408 contacts were listed, of these, 637 completed their 21-day mandatory follow up period. A total of 1782 are currently under surveillance, of which 1686 (95 percent) were seen on the reporting day.

The Ministry of Health, WHO and partners are monitoring and investigating alerts in other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in neighbouring countries. Since the last report was published, alerts were investigated in several provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as in Uganda, Rwanda, and the Central African Republic, and, to date, EVD has been ruled out in all these alerts.

Context
-------
[...]

The Democratic Republic of the Congo is also experiencing multiple disease outbreaks, including 3 separate outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in the provinces of Mongola, Maniema, and Haut Lomami/Tanganyika/Haut Katanga/Ituri, cholera in 12 provinces, measles spread across the country, and monkeypox.

[As we observed during the recent Equateur province outbreak, these WHO/AFRO situation reports come out weekly and thus cannot provide up-to-the-minute case statistics, but they do provide excellent multi-color tables, maps, and graphs, together with bullet-point summaries of all key epidemic control activities. - Mod.LXL

With the focus on Ebola, one can easily lose sight of the multitude of other health issues in the DRC, as listed in the Context section above. The ability to care for patients infected with Ebola and these other pathogens is sadly compromised by the loss of health care workers battling the outbreak. But offering free health care to all as discussed in yesterday's ProMED-mail post (Ebola update (74): Congo DR (NK) cases, response, WHO, reflections 20180822.5979052) will bring individuals into the clinics who are sick and otherwise might not seek attention. This should help diminish spread of transmissible pathogens. Furthermore, it will assist in wound treatment from the unrest, helping to restore health to the community. - Mod.LK

[As with other high-level official publications, the specific epidemiologic data were already outdated by the time of publication. However, this operating plan is very comprehensive and should be required reading for anyone who may be deployed to the DRC or will be engaged in discussions with DRC government representatives. Moreover, like a proper business plan, this document also lays out specific performance targets and budget estimates for the key activities, which can be found nowhere else. These key elements include: surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory, case management, infection prevention, vaccination, community involvement, psychosocial care, free health care, coordination and logistics, and security measures.

The total budget is estimated at 43 837 000 (dollars? euros? unclear which), with the support of numerous partners including WHO, UNICEF, Red Cross, MSF, ALIMA, etc. However, the scope of this effort is based on certain key assumptions ("Planning scenarios"), including: 200 to 300 total cases in no more than 4 geographical areas, 10 contacts per case in rural areas, 30 contacts per case in urban areas, and 3 months of operation (August-October 2018). One certainly hopes that these assumptions will hold and are not overly optimistic. - Mod.LXL]

[IOM (International Organization for Migration) edited]
https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/iom-dr-congo-migration-health-division-ebola-response-north-kivu

On 1 Aug 2018, just one week after the declaration of the end of the Ebola outbreak in Equator province, the 10th Ebola epidemic of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) was declared in the province of North Kivu, with the epicenter in the town of Mangina, approximately 30 km [18.6 mi] south east of Beni. IOM, the UN Migration Agency, is working closely with the Congolese Ministry of Health (MoH) and WHO to contain the outbreak and address the needs of affected communities.

Population mobility, including cross-border movements, was identified as a significant risk for disease transmission in this outbreak due to the high number of traders and miners, displaced populations and insecurity caused by rebels and militias in the area. IOM and MoH have conducted joint assessments at points of entry (POE) in Mangina, Beni, Butembo, and Goma to gauge the strength of the area's epidemiological surveillance system. IOM has supported the deployment of 10 epidemiologists, medical doctors, and hygiene specialists to key border areas to conduct POE surveillance, risk communication, infection prevention and control (IPC), as well as population mobility mapping (PMM) and daily flow monitoring. IOM's mobility mapping helps guiding the response, by understanding the mobility trends of the affected areas including hotspots where there is high volume of mobility and strong connection to the epicenter.

IOM'S response focus
--------------------
- Population mobility mapping (PMM) and flow monitoring (FMP) at border crossings and in the affected province.
- Points of entry (POE) surveillance (health screening, risk communication, hand washing, and hygiene promotion)
- Cross-border coordination between DRC, Republic of Uganda (Uganda), and Republic of Rwanda (Rwanda)

IOM'S appeal: USD 2.5 million

Highlights of IOM's immediate response
--------------------------------------
- IOM and MOH jointly conducted population mobility mapping (PMM) in Beni, to identify travel routes, POE, and major transit/congregation sites (ports, markets, etc.). PMM in Mangina and Goma are planned.
- IOM is supporting National Programme of Hygiene at Borders (PNHF)'s POE surveillance (health screening) activities at 21 sites in Beni and in Goma along with risk communication and hygiene promotion.
- IOM starts collecting daily population flow data at 10 POEs (5 in Goma and 5 in Beni) in order to verify the mobility volume and profiles of travelers including internal and cross-border movements.

[It is encouraging that a systematic approach like this is being adopted to monitor human movements in the North Kivu outbreak, particularly since the epicenter is so close to several adjoining countries. I could not find a precise definition or description of the tools and metrics used in population mobility mapping (PMM) and flow monitoring (FMP), but more information about the applications and data collected by these methods may be found at https://www.iom.int/health-border-mobility-management and https://migrationdataportal.org/?i=stock_abs_&t=2017. - Mod.LXL

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
After more than 28 000 Ebola virus disease cases and at least 11 000 deaths in West Africa during the 2014-2016 epidemic, the world remains without a licensed vaccine or therapeutic broadly available and demonstrated to alleviate suffering. This deficiency has been felt acutely in the 2, short, following years with 2 Ebola virus outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and a Marburg virus outbreak in Uganda. Despite billions of US dollars invested in developing medical countermeasures for filoviruses in the antecedent decades, resulting in an array of preventative, diagnostic, and therapeutic products, none are available on commercial shelves. This paper explores why just-in-time research efforts in the field during the West Africa epidemic failed, as well as some recent initiatives to prevent similarly lost opportunities.

[This is a thoughtful critical review of the myriad difficulties in developing medical products for Ebola and other emerging pathogens. An industry perspective would be useful here, because coming up with new products is much more about the "D" than the "R." The lack of "commercially available products on the shelves" is not surprising, since one cannot depend on private (venture-backed start-ups) or public (listed companies) equity markets to bankroll these projects. It is a tall order indeed to convince investors to put millions of dollars into developing something like a Nipah vaccine or anthrax antidote, only to be stockpiled and -- in the ideal world -- never have to be used. By definition, therefore, such products are "orphan drugs." We have seen some successful public-private partnerships by organizations such as the Medicines for Malaria Venture (for tropical diseases) and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (for orphan diseases), but these were "stationary" targets, not the moving targets presented by Ebola and other infectious diseases that break out at unexpected locations and times. - Mod.LXL]

[New England Journal of Medicine, edited]

ref: Munster VJ, Bausch DG, de Wit E, et al. Outbreaks in a rapidly changing Central Africa -- lessons from Ebola. N Engl J Med. 2018. doi: 10.1056/NEJMp1807691
----------------------------------------------------------------------
West and Central Africa are experiencing explosive growth in urban populations, economic activities, and connectivity. The recent Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa demonstrated the vulnerability of the local health care infrastructure to newly emerging infectious diseases. 2 key factors contributing to the epidemic's unprecedented size were growth-related: large urban populations that overwhelmed the public health infrastructure of these resource-poor countries and the extensive spatial and technological connectivity of the population (1). These factors portend an increased risk in Central Africa of emerging infectious diseases caused by both known and unknown pathogens. Such unwelcome side effects of rapid growth can be mitigated only by strengthening the health care infrastructure, including diagnostic and clinical capacity, to meet the health care needs of the population; investment in the training of health care workers and African scientists; expansion of research capacity; development of disease-surveillance programs focused on humans, livestock, and wildlife; and rapid deployment of control measures when outbreaks occur.

A review of past outbreaks of Ebola virus (Zaire ebolavirus, EBOV) in Central Africa (Gabon, Republic of the Congo [ROC], and Democratic Republic of Congo [DRC]) is instructive. Before 2013, EBOV outbreaks consisted of relatively small numbers of cases and were effectively contained by basic public health, quarantine, and containment measures. The largest EBOV outbreak before 2013 occurred in the DRC in 1976 and comprised 318 cases. These outbreaks occurred predominantly in remote regions, where they had limited opportunity to spread over wide geographic areas. In the 2014 and 2017 EBOV outbreaks in the DRC, for instance, the initial zoonotic introduction from a wildlife reservoir in a remote area resulted in limited human-to-human transmission and rapid containment. Only 66 cases were detected in humans in the 2014 outbreak and 8 in the 2017 outbreak.

In stark contrast, 28 646 cases of EBOV were reported during the 2013-2016 epidemic in West Africa. That outbreak dispersed rapidly over large geographic areas in Africa, including major urban centers, and there were several cases of nosocomial infections in Europe and the United States. Among the West African casualties were more than 500 health care workers, whose loss further decimated an already extremely thin workforce. Rapid spread contributed to the inability to control the outbreak for more than 2 years, and the extended epidemic resulted in an estimated USD 2.2 billion loss in the gross domestic products of Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea. The overall costs of the international response exceeded USD 3.9 billion (2).

The unprecedented scale of the West African epidemic has been attributed to a combination of factors: large urban populations, minimal public health infrastructure, a slow response from international partners, and extensive connectivity of the populations. The recently contained outbreak of Ebola virus disease in the Equateur province of the DRC appeared to be unusual for the region, in part because of such connectivity, with major waterways connecting the epicenter of the Bikoro region with major population centers including Kinshasa (population, 11.8 million) and Kisangani (1.6 million) in the DRC and Brazzaville (1.8 million) in the ROC; although the outbreak did not reach those cities, cases were reported in the regional capital of Mbandaka (1.2 million). These circumstances were alarmingly similar to those surrounding the West African epidemic, but the rapid response of the DRC ministry of health and international partners, including the likely benefit from the deployment of the VSV-Ebola vaccine, managed to block further spread.

However, only 7 days after that Ebola outbreak was declared over, a new outbreak was declared in the Mabalako health zone, territory of Beni in the DRC province of North Kivu. Mabalako is a challenging area, given its political instability, several large population centers -- Goma (population, 1 million), Butembo (670 000), and Beni (230 000) -- and substantial cross-border movement into Uganda and Rwanda. In light of the increase in frequency of Ebola outbreaks in DRC and their relatively rapid detection, it seems that it would be well worth the relatively small cost of investing in diagnostic capacity and training to avert the cost of containing any large outbreak. We believe that a similar return on investment could be expected from financial and educational support for improving and expanding the clinical care infrastructure.

Even if the ongoing outbreak in the DRC can be rapidly curtailed, the demographic data clearly indicate how the advance of the human footprint across Central Africa has exacerbated the risk of large outbreaks. Over recent decades, Central Africa has undergone profound changes in population structure. A rapid decline in death rates, in particular among children less than 5 years of age, has contributed to rapid population increases, combined with a demographic shift toward large numbers of working-age people (3). In addition, Central Africa is experiencing the world's fastest rate of urbanization, with 50 percent of the Central African population expected to live in urban areas by 2030; and rural cities with populations exceeding 1 million, such as Mbandaka and Goma in DRC, are becoming more common throughout Central Africa.

One important factor in the potential rapid geographic spread of emerging infectious diseases is road construction for logging, mining, and hydroelectric activities that continues to open access to remote locations in Central Africa, facilitating movement between previously isolated communities (4). Road construction and other anthropogenic disturbances directly alter ecosystems in which pathogens reside (5). These activities not only open previously pristine areas, but also reduce traveling times to and from highly urbanized areas such as Kinshasa and Brazzaville, both of which are increasingly hubs for global connectivity from which Asia, South and North America, and Europe can be reached in less than 12 hours. Large infrastructure programs such as the Program for Infrastructure Development in Africa will soon facilitate even greater connectivity among African countries and regions.

Clearly, Central Africa is rapidly approaching a tipping point. Africa's economic development is a positive change that cannot and should not be stopped. At the same time, rapid economic and demographic transitions bring the challenges of emerging infectious disease outbreaks of increased frequency, size, and global impact. Yet there is an alternative to this foreboding narrative of development-associated infectious diseases: rather than pose a risk, continuing population growth and increasing income and education levels can help spur greater demand for infrastructure to support sustainable economic development, including implementation of basic health services.

A substantial proportion of economic gains associated with extractive or road-building activities could be used to strengthen public health preparedness for emerging diseases. In addition, rather than spending exorbitant amounts reactively for control operations, international donors could invest in long-term public health and prevention infrastructure. Directed and sustained investment is urgently needed, before ongoing demographic and economic changes conspire to cause major outbreaks of both national and international consequence. This investment could include training and education of health care workers, especially in rural areas, to identify, report, and properly handle cases of unknown emerging diseases, as well as increases in diagnostic capacity and access to clinical care in both urban and rural areas. In addition, the region will need well-trained African scientists who can strengthen the much-needed clinical research infrastructure for testing new vaccines and therapeutics.

Recent economic gains in several Central African countries have not yet resulted in increased investments in healthcare infrastructure. Thus, strong international commitments of donor funds will be necessary to prevent devastating infectious disease outbreaks. World Bank trust funds, such as the Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility, can provide rapid surge financing during the initial stages of a severe outbreak. But we believe that long-term funding programs should also be made available for direct investment in the strengthening and sustaining of general health systems. This strategy will not only enable a better and faster response to emerging infectious diseases, but will also result in permanent improvements in quality of life through better access to care.
