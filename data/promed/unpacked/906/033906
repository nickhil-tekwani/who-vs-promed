Since the end of 2015 until now (March 2016), HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] events have spread in many areas [in Indonesia].

The relationship between the government and the private/commercial poultry sector is still not open, so that cases of disease outbreaks, especially HPAI, which occurred on farms, often go unreported, even covered.

The [19] links below [see comment and item [2] below] are a few case reports of bird flu publicized by the mass media during the last 2 months (February-March 2016). They reported cases in Java (5 provinces, including Jakarta), Sumatra (2 provinces), Kalimantan and Sulawesi.

We are grateful to Erry Setyawan for the above brief epidemiological information, including the 19 URLs from Indonesian press. While the reservoir and source of human infections with HPAI H5N1 is poultry and other birds, since January 2013 all ProMED-mail's HPAI postings from Indonesia addressed exclusively human cases, the disease regarded as endemic in poultry.

The 19 URLs, relate to press reports, 17 of which are in Indonesian. Of the 2 English sources, one could not be downloaded. We present the remaining one (item [2]), which may adequately demonstrate the situation as briefly described by the communicator.

Airlangga University's Avian influenza Research Centre (AIRC) is researching samples of the H5N1 avian influenza virus that killed almost 6000 poultry across Banyuwangi and Lamongan in East Java in March [2016]. Researchers are suspecting that a malignant mutation is the cause behind the return of the outbreak on Indonesian soil.

"The outbreak that happened in early March [2016] is possibly caused by a mutated form of the H5N1 virus, and our preliminary hypothesis is that the virus managed to mutate in a short period of time due to the overuse of vaccines that spiralled out of control," said the Head of AIRC, CA Nidom to Tempo.co on Wed 16 Mar 2016.

Nidom and his team extracted samples from all across Banyuwangi and Lamongan to check for traces of the viruses , taking as much as 20 samples from poultry vendors and farmers in Lamongan. "We will analyse the samples to see how far the virus have mutated, as well as to see whether this new mutation has the capacity to cross the species barrier," he said.

The claim of over-vaccination has been rebutted by East Java's Farming and Animal Husbandry Agency, which said that the administration of vaccines are tightly monitored by the Agency. "The government has a Quality Control Agency that monitors the quality of the vaccines that are available on the market," said the Head of Animal Health for East Java's Farming and Animal Husbandry Agency, Iswahyudi.

According to Iswahyudi, vaccines that are available in the market should already be certified and patented. "If not, then such vaccines are illegal," he said.

Previously, more than 5000 chickens and ducks have died en masse due to the H5N1 virus in the hamlet of Wringinagung in Sumberejo village, Gambiran district in Banyuwangi. Meanwhile in Lamongan's Sukorame district, some 610 fowl have died from the same virus. A farmer in Banyuwangi has also been isolated to be monitored over suspicions that he has contracted the deadly virus.

[Since HPAI H5N1 has been declared endemic in Indonesia since 2006, as indicated in the submission to the OIE dated 26 Sep 2006:"The event cannot be considered resolved, but the situation is sufficiently stable. No more follow-up reports will be sent. Information about this disease will be included in the next 6-monthly reports". The most recent annual report from Indonesia to the OIE covers 2013.

An update, and detailed findings of the current molecular investigations, to confirm or exclude the possible emergence of mutants, would be useful. - Mod.AS
