[_Clostridium botulinum_ is the bacteria responsible for producing the
botulinum toxin. Consumption of contaminated food products is one method of
introducing the toxin into the body. - Mod.TG
Olive oils can be infused with a variety of flavors so that when one "dips"
crusty bread into them, the flavored oil is ingested. - Mod.LL]
