A naturally occurring biological agent is being blamed for 13 cases
of an illness commonly known as rabbit fever.
All of the people infected camped on the west side of Utah Lake
between the end of June and the 1st week of July [2007].
The Utah Department of Health has only confirmed that 2 of the cases
are tularemia. The remaining cases are suspected with patients
showing clinical signs of the bacterial infection. Symptoms include
sudden fever, headaches, ulcers on the skin or mouth, and swollen and
painful glands.
Health officials say it's a fairly uncommon infection. There are
[normally] only 2 or 3 cases per year in Utah. The infection responds
well to appropriate antibiotics once diagnosed. If untreated, it can
be fatal.
The bacterium that causes rabbit fever is generally spread through
the handling of rabbit or other animal carcasses, but it can also be
transmitted by infected ticks, horseflies, or deerflies.
It is not passed from person to person.

[A few bits of additional information emerge from the news report
above on the outbreak of tularemia among a group of campers in Utah:
there are 13 total cases, of which 2 are confirmed. No details are as
yet available about the demographics of the campers, clinical
manifestations, mode of transmission, attack rate, treatment, or
outcome. In the US, reported cases have dropped sharply from several
thousand/year prior to 1950 to less than 200/year in the 1990s
(see <http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5109a1.htm>).
Although campers most likely will become infected during the summer
via tick bites and develop the ulcero-glandular type of tularemia, the
CDC (US Centers for Disease Control & Prevention) warns that when used
as a bioweapon "airborne _Francisella tularensis_ would be expected to
principally cause pleuropneumonitis, but some exposures might
contaminate the eye, resulting in ocular tularemia; penetrate broken
skin, resulting in ulceroglandular or glandular disease; or cause
oropharyngeal [mouth & pharynx] disease with cervical lymphadenitis
[swollen lymph nodes in the neck]."
(see
<http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/tularemia/tularemia-biological-weapon-abstract.asp#2>).
If a bioterrorism event is suspected, the FBI as well as the health
department should be notified to in part ensure the chain of
evidence. Rapid diagnostic testing for tularemia is not widely
available. Microscopic demonstration of _F. tularensis_ using
fluorescent-labeled antibodies is a rapid diagnostic procedure
performed in designated reference laboratories in the National Public
Health Laboratory Network; test results can be available within
several hours of receiving the specimens, if the laboratory is
alerted and prepared
(see
<http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/tularemia/tularemia-biological-weapon-abstract.asp#2>).
