I recall that the toxicity of certain fungi caused severe, fatal spongiform
brain damage in donkeys in Egypt, a serious economic problem. The etiology
was discovered and described by Hildebrandt, circa 1970. On the cellular
level, this may be very distinct from the current problem in ostriches,
etc., but I don't know, so I thought I'd mention it.

Following is information I received from Dr. Rosmarie Fatzer,
neuropathologist at the Swiss Reference Center for animal TSE:
In 1998 the Swiss TSE Reference Center contacted Dr. G. Wells in Weybridge
on behalf of this ostrich publication. According to Dr. Wells "the changes
in the medulla were not like those in cattle or any other species with a
TSE." He further stated that to his knowledge transmission to mice and
hamsters (done by Dr. H. Diringer's group) did not provide evidence of
transmissibility. However, the authors of the ostrich story to his
knowledge did not supply paraffin blocks to the VLA nor any other
institution for immunohistochemistry (IHC), though it had been offered to
them that IHC would be attempted. Therefore, Dr. Wells at that time
considered the question as to whether these ostriches had a PrP-related
disorder as unresolved.
