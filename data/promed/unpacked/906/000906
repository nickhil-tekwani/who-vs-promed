Man dies after eating meat infected with anthrax
------------------------------------------------
One person died and 8 others were taken to hospital after eating
contaminated meat. The [fatal] victim was [a 40-year-old man] from
Nyanduma, Kiambu.

His widow said he started complaining of stomachache shortly after
arriving home from the shopping centre where he had eaten the meat.
"He started to complain of stomach pain and we took him to a clinic
where we were advised to take him to Kiambu hospital but he died on
the way," she said.

Those hospitalised are said to be in stable condition. Unconfirmed
reports said more than 20 people were treated at the district hospital
and discharged.

"The meat was eaten by about 150 people who had attended a burial
ceremony and most of them have travelled back and we do not know if
the meat affected them," said Mr Gabriel Waruinge, the local chief.

Mr Waruinge said a health officer who inspected and certified the meat
fit for consumption and the butcher who sold it had been arrested.

Mr John Mwai, a veterinarian, who was treating the animal for anthrax,
said he had warned the locals against eating the meat but they ignored
him.

The butcher is alleged to have slaughtered the animal and sold the
beef to unsuspecting customers.

[As classical an account of gastro-enteric anthrax as one could ask
for. Only recently has anthrax reporting in Kenya reflected reality.
Cattle outbreaks are most commonly reported in the Central Province
and around Nairobi, which may be more a function of reporting bias.

During 2005 through 2008, bovine outbreaks were reported in Nairobi
(19 outbreaks), Central (36), Rift Valley (13), Coast (4), and Eastern
(8) provinces.
