I'd be interested in genuine expert perceptions/opinions about the
significance of the multi-species infections of the PIA(H1N1)'09
[influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009] virus.

My impression is that, aside from pigs and possibly ferrets, it
appears to be crossing rather easily to multi-species, including both
mammals and birds after apparently minimal exposure, and probably more
importantly, it seems to be capable of immediate competent/efficient
transmission amongst at least pigs and turkeys after apparently
crossing from humans. This latter feature, I suspect, may be both
unusual and of relatively high significance when one considers the
potential/chances of reassortment-based viral mutations into the
future. Ordinarily one may expect sporadic inter-species crossing for
this type of virus (such as the H5N1 situation between birds and
humans, birds and felids, birds and pigs, etc.), but not necessarily
immediate (that is, without pre-adaptation through longer
inter-species exposure) efficient transmission within the new host
species (apart possibly from amongst pigs, given the phylogenetic
make-up of this virus).

Of course, my impressions may alternatively just be due to the vastly
superior surveillance capacities presently relative to the past.

Given these apparent traits, however, this virus may hold many
important lessons about what enables the influenza viruses to cross
species and transmit efficiently in multi-species and the genotypic
basis behind those factors, relative to most other influenza A viruses.

[Mr Thomson has "voiced" my concerns. This was previously hinted at,
in a less eloquent fashion, in a previous posting by the moderator. Mr
Thomson has indeed captured the heart of the problem with this
particular viral strain.

While superior technology may have much to do with what we know about
the virus, it has not explained the immediate species leaps with no
apparent adaptation time. - Mod.TG]
