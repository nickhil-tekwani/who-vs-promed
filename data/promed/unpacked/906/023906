Federal and provincial health officials are warning Albertans to avoid eating some raw milk cheeses in the wake of a bacterial outbreak in which one patient has died and as many as 16 others have fallen ill. Consumers in British Columbia [BC] and Alberta began getting sick in late July 2013 after eating product from Gort's Gouda Cheese Farm, but it wasn't until late last week [week of 9 Sep 2013] that provincial epidemiologists linked the growing cluster of _E. coli_ O157: H7 cases to the Salmon Arm manufacturer and notified the Canadian Food Inspection Agency [CFIA].

CFIA officials issued a health alert late Tue 17 Sep 2013, for all cheeses sold at the company's farm outlet, at retail stores in the 2 provinces and through the Internet from 27 May 2013 to 14 Sep 2013. Lot codes 122 through 138 are affected by the recall.

Dr James Talbot, Alberta's chief medical officer of health, said 7 people who fell sick in the province, 5 from Calgary and 2 from Edmonton, have been genetically linked to the tainted cheese and another 2 incidents of illness are under investigation because their food history indicates the patients may have eaten the company's product. 2 of the confirmed cases became sick in late July 2013, but the remaining 5 fell ill between the last week of August 2013 and the 1st few days of September 2013.

Talbot said the patients' food histories tipped off investigators. "Most of the cases had travelled to BC and purchased product from the farm, so that's a pretty unusual pattern," he said.

None of the Albertans who have fallen ill have had to be hospitalized, but among the 8 confirmed or suspected cases in BC is a patient from that province's Interior region who died in August 2013.

On Wed 18 Sep 2013, federal food inspectors were again at the facility preparing an inventory of potentially contaminated products on site that will need to be destroyed, and those in the market that will need to be recalled. "The affected products were sold at the manufacturer's outlet (35 percent of total sales), at retail stores primarily in British Columbia, as well as some stores in Alberta," CFIA spokesman Guy Gravelle said in an email reply to questions. "In addition, there are mail order and online sales, mainly in Western Canada."

[2] Bovine vaccination

Widespread vaccination of cattle against _Escherichia coli_ O157 could vastly decrease the human incidence of disease associated with this pathogen, a mathematical simulation suggested.

If the effects of the vaccine simply reflected its efficacy in cattle, a 50 percent reduction in cases would be expected because the vaccine has been shown to halve the fecal shedding of the pathogen, according to Louise Matthews, PhD, of the University of Glasgow, and colleagues. However, because the vaccine targets high-density shedding strains of _E. coli_ O157, so-called supershedders, the decrease in human cases could be expected to reach 83 percent (95 percent CI [confidence interval] 76-93), the researchers reported online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Vaccines have been developed, but considerable obstacles to their use exist. In Canada, one vaccine has been licensed, but in the USA only partial licensure has been granted to the 2 available vaccines. "There are conflicting responsibilities of the medical and veterinary agencies. The bodies charged with licensing vaccines in animals must typically certify that controls are not just safe but improve animal health; this remit poses a problem for the control of zoonotic pathogens that are benign in their reservoir," Matthews and colleagues explained.

Data on the scope of effects of cattle vaccination on human disease would be essential for such a system to be developed, so the researchers calculated mathematical models that take into account the inevitable heterogeneity of transmission between species. They noted that specific genetic markers that relate to the pathogens' ability to produce Shiga toxin (stx2 and stx2c) have been linked with human disease, but the epidemiology of these strains in the cattle host and effects on shedding intensity has been unclear.

Supershedding has received considerable attention as a factor in infectious transmission between cattle, but hasn't been considered in relation to cross-species transmission. The researchers analyzed data from Health Protection Scotland, identifying 237 human cases that occurred between 2002 and 2004, and tested almost 13 000 cattle fecal samples, finding 4 percent that were positive for _E. coli_ O157. They had previously reported that the most common phage types (PTs) of the pathogen found in cattle in Scotland were PT 21/28, which is a supershedding strain, while PT 32 is a non-supershedding strain.

When they analyzed the frequency of PT 21/28 among samples from the human cases, they found it to be far more common than would be expected according to how frequently it's identified in cattle (P less than 0.001), while PT 32 is found less frequently (P less than 0.001). They then calculated that the most accurate model predicting the supershedding strains in the human cases involved a threshold shedding level of 1300 colony-forming units per gram (cfu/g) of feces (95 percent CI 600-2300).

Further analysis determined that the stx2 variant is found much more frequently in the supershedding strain, and that high concentrations of shedding in this variant had an odds ratio of 6.54 for the threshold level of 1300 cfu/g to be met (P less than 0.001). This finding confirmed that high shedding is the predominant factor influencing human disease, rather than features such as differences in clinical pathogenicity once transmission has occurred.

This threshold of 1300 cfu/g was then used to determine that eliminating only the 12 percent of highest shedding densities through vaccination would result in the 50 percent reduction in cattle and 83 percent decline in human cases.

"Because the currently available vaccines reduce high-concentration shedding of the pathogen by cattle, which we show to heavily influence transmission across the species boundary, they should be especially effective at reducing the number of human illnesses," Matthews and colleagues predicted.

Thus far, Canada is the only country to grant a full license to the vaccine. "Uptake, however, is poor, with the vaccine reaching less than 5 percent of the market, a likely consequence of the fact that, currently farmers would bear the cost of vaccination but receive no direct perceived benefit, because the cattle harbor the organism without succumbing to clinical disease," the researchers noted.

"A coordinated approach would help close the current gap in remit between the separate agencies licensing human and veterinary interventions and provide a starting point for assessing how the costs of interventions might be borne across the multiple stakeholders," they concluded.

Regarding supershedders and EHEC vaccines, the following is extracted from Lutwick LI: Enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ infections. In: Confronting Emerging Zoonoses: The One Health Paradigm. Yamada A, Kahn LH, Kaplan B, Monath TP, Woodall J, Conti LA (eds) Springer, Tokyo, Japan, (in press) with the citations removed:

Most infected cattle pass EHEC in stool at low numbers (less than 100 colony forming units/gram stool). Such low numbers can make detection difficult, often underestimating overall carriage prevalence and excretion is often intermittent. Some animals, however, harbor quite high amounts of EHEC for prolonged amounts of time. One report found that 9 percent of carriers excreted over 96 percent of total EHEC. It is these animals, termed supershedders, which are the major transmitters to other animals' gastrointestinal tracts and/or hides. Non-EHEC shedding cattle are 5 times more likely not to be housed with a supershedder. Supershedding is linked to colonization of the rectoanal junction of the animal where proteins other than LEE [locus of enterocyte effacement] seem to contribute to adherence to the rectoanal junction stratified squamous epithelial cells.

....a serotype O157 outer membrane-based vaccine (siderophore receptor and porin proteins) reduced the overall prevalence of _E. coli_ O157:H7 as well as the prevalence of supershedders. This large study confirmed the observations of older, smaller studies. A meta-analysis of this vaccine and a second commercial vaccine targeting the type III secretion system proteins also suggested bovine vaccination as an effective modality in the control of EHEC in humans. - Mod.LL
