Four people have died, and 2 fresh cases of [listeriosis] have been detected in a national outbreak linked to contaminated rockmelons [cantaloupes]. A Victorian man and a Queensland woman have taken the number of confirmed cases to 17. NSW [New South Wales] and Victoria have both recorded 6 cases; there have been 4 cases in Queensland and one in Tasmania. The outbreak has been linked to 2 deaths in NSW and 2 in Victoria.

Rockmelon from a farm [in Nericon, near Griffith in NSW] has been linked to the [listeriosis] outbreak that has affected 17 people across the country.

Victoria's Deputy Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said the most recent case had been linked to the outbreak strain through microbiological tests.

That state's 6 cases have affected 3 men and 3 women aged between 60 and 90.

NSW Health's director of communicable diseases, Vicky Sheppeard, said the Victorian man and the Queensland woman got sick before the contaminated melons were recalled on 28 Feb 2018. Dr Sheppeard said listeriosis had a lengthy incubation period of up to 70 days. "There are multiple foods consumed and retailers used by the cases, which need to be thoroughly investigated and the findings matched to specialist laboratory test results, to determine the source."

She said NSW Health responded immediately with the NSW Food Authority and other state health departments to pinpoint the cause and advise vulnerable groups on how to minimise their risk. "All state and national guidelines have been followed and public warnings issued here and interstate when the food source was identified."

All affected melons have been withdrawn from sale and distribution; the rockmelons now available are not affected. If consumers are not sure of the origins of a rockmelon, they should put it in the waste bin to avoid further contamination.

The NSW Food Authority reminded people vulnerable to [listeriosis] to avoid all foods that posed a risk, including pre-packed cold salads, pre-cooked cold chicken, cold delicatessen meats, pate, raw or smoked seafood, unpasteurized milk, soft cheeses, sprouted seeds and raw mushrooms.

[The number of cases and deaths in the current listeriosis outbreak traced to rockmelons (cantaloupes) in Australia have increased to 17 and 4, respectively.

State health departments were able to pinpoint the source of the outbreak to a farm in Nericon, near the city of Griffith, in the New South Wales (NSW), Riverina district (http://theconversation.com/what-is-listeria-and-how-does-it-spread-in-rockmelons-92651). However, we have not been told so far how the rockmelons became contaminated.

Riverina is an agricultural region of south western NSW, Australia. A map of Australia showing the location of Nericon can be found at https://www.whereis.com/nsw/nericon-2680. A HealthMap of New South Wales, Australia can be found at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=5672344,284.

My colleague, ProMED-mail moderator LXL reports that Qatar has now banned the importation of melons from Australia and New Zealand (source article in Chinese, machine translated, http://spzx.foods1.com/show_2726017.htm). - Mod.ML]
