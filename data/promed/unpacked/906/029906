A creche (daycare center) in County Galway has been temporarily closed after an outbreak of _E. coli_ that resulted in the hospitalisation of 2 children.

The HSE [Health Service Executive] had recently warned of an increase in cases of a type of _E.coli_ called Verotoxigenic _E. coli_ or enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC). It manifests as a serious form of gastroenteritis that can cause diarrhea, which may be bloody, and abdominal pain.

Three children from the Galway creche were last week diagnosed with the bug. The HSE has told The Journal that 2 of these children are currently in hospital. Four further cases were identified this week when the HSE's Outbreak Control Team started its investigation, which involved taking stool samples from all of the staff and children for testing.

"EHEC can spread in a number of ways, including contact with infected animals, contaminated soil, water, or certain foods, and can be spread among toddlers who are not toilet trained," the HSE said. It said the majority of cases of EHEC get better with no treatment and without hospitalisation. However, the most serious complication is hemolytic uremic syndrome, or HUS, which occurs in up to 10% of EHEC cases. This can lead to anemia and kidney failure and requires intensive medical treatment.

In its warning at the beginning of this month [July 2018], the HSE said there had been 96 cases of EHEC over a 10-day period, which was 3 times as high as the same time in 2017. In 2017, there were 927 confirmed cases over the year. The HSE said careful handwashing is key to preventing the spread of this infection.

Children and staff of the Galway creche will not be allowed to return to the cr√®che until they have had 2 negative stool samples. "Children or staff who have Vtec bacteria in their stool will not be allowed back into creches or other child-minding centres until they are free of infection because of the risk of infecting others."

[Enteric infections, including EHEC, can spread easily in the childcare setting. Infections with _E. coli_ that produce Shiga toxin, the prototypic strain being O157:H7, can result in bloody, usually non-febrile, diarrhea, which may progress to kidney failure and breakdown of red blood cells related to the toxin's effect on the kidney. The use of antibiotics in the early stages of the infection can increase the risk of complications. - Mod.LL
