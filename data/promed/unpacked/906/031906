1st Report of Vidalia Onion (_Allium cepa_) Naturally Infected with
Tomato spotted wilt virus and Iris yellow spot virus (Family

Vidalia onion is an important crop in Georgia's agriculture with
worldwide recognition as a specialty vegetable. Vidalia onions are
short-day, Granex-type sweet onions grown within a specific area of
southeastern Georgia.
Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) has been endemic to Georgia crops
for the past decade, but has gone undetected in Vidalia onions.
Tobacco thrips (_Frankliniella fusca_) and Western flower thrips
(_Frankliniella occidentalis_) are the primary vectors for TSWV in
this region, and a number of plant species serve as reproductive
reservoirs for the vector or virus.
Iris yellow spot virus (IYSV), an emerging tospovirus that is
potentially a devastating pathogen of onion, has been reported in
many locations in the western United States (2,4). _Thrips tabaci_ is
the known vector for IYSV, but it is unknown if non-crop plants play
a role in its epidemiology in Georgia.
During October 2003, a small (n = 12) sampling of onions with
chlorosis and dieback of unknown etiology from the Vidalia region was
screened for a variety of viruses, and TSWV and IYSV infections were
serologically detected. Since that time, leaf and bulb tissues from
4424 onion samples were screened for TSWV and IYSV using double
antibody sandwich-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) with
commercial kits (Agdia Inc., Elkhart, IN).
Samples were collected from 53 locations in the Vidalia region during
the growing season between November 2003 and March 2004. Plants
exhibiting stress, such as tip dieback, necrotic lesions, chlorosis
or environmental damage were selected. Of these, 306 were positive
for TSWV and 396 were positive for IYSV using positive threshold
absorbance of 3 times the average plus 2 standard deviations of
healthy negative onion controls.
Positive serological findings of the onion tissues were verified by
immunocapture-reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(IC-RT-PCR) for TSWV (3) and RT-PCR for IYSV (1). In both instances,
a region of the viral nucleocapsid (N) gene was amplified. The PCR
products were analyzed with gel electrophoresis with an ethidium
bromide stain in 0.8 percent agarose.
86 percent (n = 263) of the TSWV ELISA-positive samples exhibited the
expected 774-bp product and 55 percent (n = 217) of the IYSV
ELISA-positive samples exhibited the expected 962-bp product. The
reduced success of the IYSV verification could be attributed to the
age and deteriorated condition of the samples at the time of
amplification.
_Thrips tabaci_ were obtained from onion seedbeds and cull piles
within the early sampling (n = 84) and screened for TSWV by the use
of an indirect-ELISA to the nonstructural (NSs) protein of TSWV. Of
the thrips sampled, 25 were positive in ELISA.
While the incidence of IYSV and TSWV in the Vidalia onion crop has
been documented, more research is needed to illuminate their
potential danger to Vidalia onions.

[The gist of this report is that TSWV and IYSV have been detected for
the 1st time in the Vidalia region despite its undetected presence in
onion fields. Disease incidences were 7 percent and 9 percent for
TSWV and IYSV, respectively. Disease management requires weed control
and use of alternating applications of different chemical
insecticides. Insecticide resistance is often a factor in disease
management. 4 thrips species are the major vectors of TSWV:
_Frankliniella occidentalis_ (western flower thrips); _F. schultzei_,
_F. fusca_ (tobacco thrips); and _Thrips tabaci_ (onion thrips). TSWV
is now common in temperate, subtropical, and tropical regions around
the world and is a major constraint to onion production.
Regarding the Granex-type of onion, it is a short-day variety. To be
marketed as a true "Vidalia," an onion must be grown in the Vidalia
area and conform to the Yellow-Granex type.
