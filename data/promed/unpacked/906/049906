The outbreak of Legionnaires' Disease which has previously been confirmed
in 10 persons and killed two persons and has claimed a third life. Health
officials said that a 68-year-old woman from the Glastonbury area of
Somerset who became ill on September 20 has died. A major investigation is
still under way to trace the source of the outbreak. A spokesman for
Somerset Health Authority confirmed that the latest victim died at Musgrove
Park Hospital in Taunton. She was admitted on September 25 and transferred
to the intensive therapy unit two days later. The other victims have all
since recovered.

[I presume this to be an extension of the outbreak initially reported to be
associated with a plastics factory near Glastonbury. That outbreak had
previously been declared to have ended. ProMED-mail references are cited
