During 2006, state health departments notified CDC of 3 outbreaks of
_Salmonella_ species infections in persons who had been in contact
with chicks and other baby poultry (ducklings, goslings, and baby
turkeys) purchased at agricultural feed stores. The feed stores
received the poultry from hatcheries, and each of the 3 outbreaks was
traced to a single hatchery. For decades, baby poultry, particularly
chicks and ducklings, have been known to be a source of salmonellosis
(1-4). More recently, the source of birds associated with
salmonellosis outbreaks has been traced back to individual
hatcheries. Many persons who purchase baby poultry remain unaware
that contact with these birds puts them and others who are exposed to
the birds, especially children and immunocompromised persons, at risk
for salmonellosis. This report describes the 3 outbreaks and provides
recommendations for preventing transmission of salmonellosis from
birds to humans.
Hatchery A. In May 2006, during routine surveillance of laboratory
results, the public health laboratory at the Michigan Department of
Community Health detected a cluster of cases that were culture
positive for _Salmonella enterica_ serotype 4,5,12,i:-. Laboratory
analysis of the isolates by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
yielded an indistinguishable DNA pattern that was later designated as
the outbreak strain. During April-July 2006, the laboratory isolated
the outbreak strain from a total of 21 clinical samples obtained from
ill persons in Michigan. Ill persons were interviewed by state public
health officials and asked about symptoms and possible sources of
exposure. All 21 patients reported diarrhea, and 6 (29 percent)
reported bloody diarrhea. 12 (57 percent) patients reported vomiting.
Seven (33 percent) of the 21 ill patients were hospitalized for a
median of 4 days (range: 1-9 days); complete data on recovery status
were not available at the time of interview. The median age of
hospitalized patients was 31 years (range: 7 months-79 years). The
median age of all patients was 18 years (range: 7 months-79 years).
12 (57 percent) patients reported exposure to baby poultry in the 7
days before illness onset; 8 of these patients reported purchasing
the birds as a source of meat or eggs, 2 patients reported purchasing
the birds as family pets, and for 2 patients, the reason for purchase
was unknown. The hatchery source of the baby poultry was determined
for 8 (67 percent) of the 12 patients who reported exposure; 2
patients purchased birds directly from hatchery A in Michigan, and 6
patients purchased birds from 5 different agricultural feed stores
that had all received birds from hatchery A. This hatchery also was
the source of chicks and ducklings that caused salmonellosis
outbreaks in Michigan in 1999 and 2000 (6).
Hatchery B. On 3 May 2006, the Nebraska Health and Human Services
System received a report of 2 children with stool culture confirmed
salmonellosis. The health department began an investigation on 4 May
2007 and learned that the 2 patients both attended the same Nebraska
day care center, where they had handled pet chicks brought into the
center by a parent. Additional interviews at the day care center
detected a total of 10 persons (9 students and a staff member) with
diarrhea (3 or more loose stools in 24 hours), and 3 (30 percent)
with bloody diarrhea. None of the 10 persons were hospitalized.
Stool samples were requested of all persons with diarrhea. Of the 6
additional stool samples obtained, 2 were positive for _Salmonella
enterica_ serotype Montevideo. Of the 4 total positive stool samples,
all yielded serotype Montevideo isolates with indistinguishable PFGE
DNA patterns. Three of the 4 children had handled the chicks, and the
other had the opportunity to do so, although direct contact could not
be confirmed.
During April-June 2006, state public health laboratories identified
in the national PulseNet database the same strain of serotype
Montevideo in a total of 56 patients (including those from the
Nebraska day care center) from 21 states. 48 of these patients were
interviewed during May-July 2006 by state public health officials and
asked about symptoms and possible exposures. All interviewed patients
reported diarrhea, and 25 (52 percent) reported bloody diarrhea.
Eight (17 percent) patients were hospitalized for a median of 2 days
(range: 1-7 days), and all fully recovered; the median age of
hospitalized patients was 10 months (range: 27 days-53 years). The
median age of all interviewed patients was 24 months (range: 27
days-82 years).
42 (88 percent) of the 48 interviewed patients reported exposure to
baby poultry in the 5 days before illness onset. 17 (40 percent) of
the interviewed patients purchased the birds for meat or eggs, 18 (43
percent) purchased them as pets, and for 7 patients, the reason for
purchase was unknown. 37 (88 percent) of 42 patients with exposure to
baby poultry purchased the birds at a store, including at least 14
different agricultural feed stores and a general store; other
patients did not report the facility from which they purchased the
birds.
All 37 patients who purchased baby poultry from a store were asked
whether the store provided information on preventing transmission of
_Salmonella_ species infection from birds to humans; 3 patients
reported receiving this type of information. In addition, 31 patients
who reported exposure to baby poultry were asked whether they were
aware that they could contract salmonellosis from baby poultry; 24
(77 percent) of these patients reported being unaware that baby
poultry could be a source of salmonellosis. The hatchery source of
the baby poultry was determined for 9 (21 percent) of the 42 patients
who had been exposed to baby poultry; 7 of these 9 patients purchased
the baby poultry from 3 feed stores that all received birds from
hatchery B in New Mexico. PFGE analysis of isolates from baby poultry
and environmental swabs from hatchery B yielded a DNA pattern that
was indistinguishable from the _S._ Montevideo outbreak strain in the
patients. Hatchery B also had been identified previously as the
source of chicks that caused outbreaks of human salmonellosis in 2002
and 2005 (New Mexico Department of Health, unpublished data, 2007).
Hatchery C. During March-May 2006, the Oregon State Public Health
Laboratory identified 4 patients with _Salmonella enterica_ serotype
Ohio isolates; PFGE analysis yielded indistinguishable DNA patterns.
All 4 patients were interviewed by public health officials and asked
whether they had been hospitalized and about possible sources of
exposure. The median age of patients was 32 years (range: 1-77
years). One patient was hospitalized.
All 4 patients reported exposure to baby poultry in the days before
illness onset. Three of the patients had purchased chicks from one
agricultural feed store; the source for the other patient was
unknown. After a review of invoices from the feed store, the source
for the chicks was determined to be hatchery C in neighboring
Washington. Hatchery C had been identified previously as the source
of chicks that caused outbreaks of salmonellosis in 1995, 1996, 2003,
2004, and 2005 (Oregon Department of Public Health, unpublished data,
2007).
To assess the prevalence of _Salmonella_ species in chicks at retail
stores, the Oregon Department of Agriculture and the Oregon Public
Health Division surveyed 16 agricultural feed stores in western
Oregon during February-March 2006. Although the surveys began before
the outbreak was detected, the data were used to assist in the
subsequent outbreak investigation. Store representatives were asked
about conditions under which birds were purchased, housed, and sold.
In addition, cloacal swabs from 137 chicks from the 16 stores were
cultured for _Salmonella_; serotypes Ohio, Montevideo, or Tennessee
were recovered from 25 (18 percent) of the chicks from 10 of the 16
stores. All agricultural feed stores with chicks whose swabs yielded
_S._ Ohio received these chicks from hatchery C.

Editorial Note:
This report describes 3 concurrent outbreaks of salmonellosis that
occurred during 2006, the 1st year during which more than a single
baby poultry-associated salmonellosis outbreak has been recognized.
These outbreaks demonstrate that salmonellosis associated with baby
poultry purchased from agricultural feed stores is a source of
salmonellosis and an ongoing public health problem.
Each year in the USA, an estimated 1.4 million _Salmonella_
infections result in thousands of hospitalizations and hundreds of
deaths (7). The percentage caused by contact with baby poultry
remains unknown, and few measures have been implemented to prevent
transmission of _Salmonella_ organisms from baby poultry to humans.
Fewer than 20 hatcheries in the USA provide the majority of baby
poultry sold in agricultural feed stores in the nation, and certain
hatcheries have been implicated repeatedly as sources of baby
poultry-associated salmonellosis outbreaks. Such outbreaks might be
prevented by control measures at these and other hatcheries and at
agricultural feed stores, where most persons purchase baby poultry.
Providing information to customers about the health risks of bird
contact and providing adequate hand washing facilities might prevent
such infections (8). Certain state health departments (e.g., in
Washington and Oregon) have urged feed stores to display warnings and
provide point-of-sale educational materials to persons purchasing
baby poultry; however, such campaigns are voluntary and might not be
implemented. Increased emphasis on such point-of-sale educational
materials might reduce numbers of infections. Evaluation of the
effectiveness of mandated point-of-sale education in reducing baby
poultry-associated salmonellosis might help guide future prevention
programs.
Although the purchase of baby poultry from agricultural feed stores
by persons for meat or eggs or as pets is legal in all states, a 2005
survey indicated that the sale of chicks to individual persons is
regulated by law in certain states. For example, 13 states and the
District of Columbia (DC) prohibit the sale of birds that have been
dyed. Arkansas, Kentucky, New York, and Wisconsin have laws
establishing a minimum number of birds that can be sold to individual
persons, and 12 states and DC have laws restricting the youngest age
at which birds can be sold. The effectiveness of such legislation is
unknown. None of the hatcheries or stores implicated in the outbreaks
were in violation of state laws related to the sale of baby poultry.
The hatchery B outbreak investigation described in this report
indicates that persons who purchase baby poultry usually are unaware
that _Salmonella_ species infections can be transmitted from poultry
to humans. Although baby birds such as chicks and ducklings might not
appear dirty, they can have feces on their feathers and beaks, areas
that children are more likely to touch or place in their mouths,
possibly resulting in infection. In addition, all items that have
been in contact with birds, such as floors, tables, rugs, sinks, and
fingers, can be contaminated with a fecal film.
To reduce the risk for illness or death from salmonellosis, persons
should be educated about the risks of contact with baby poultry,
should avoid contact with bird feces, and should wash their hands
with soap and warm water after handling baby poultry or anything that
has been in contact with them. In addition, children aged less than 5
years should not be allowed to handle baby chicks or other baby
birds. At the community level, hatcheries should provide written
information for customers at agricultural feed stores and customers
who purchase directly from hatcheries, recommending ways to prevent
transmission of Salmonella organisms from birds to humans. Additional
information regarding health risks posed by contact with baby poultry

[This moderator apologizes for the late posting of this CDC report.
At this time, however, it serves to complement today's report of
human salmonellosis from baby turtles. The handling of these animals
by young children and immunosuppressed individuals, in particular, is
a significant hazard. - Mod.LL]
