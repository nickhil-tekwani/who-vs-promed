No signs of bird flu in mass Cambodian duck deaths
-----------------------------------------------
Cambodian health authorities and police, who are investigating the
mysterious deaths of 2000 ducks recently imported from neighboring
Viet Nam, said that initial results indicated that the cause was
probably not avian influenza.
The mass deaths of at least 2000 birds on 5 farms on Wednesday and
Thursday [4 and 5 Jan 2006] soon [how soon?! - Mod.AS] after 5050
ducks arrived from Viet Nam has sparked panic among locals, but the
police chief of Samrong Toung district in the southern province of
Kampong Speu, Pat Kimhong, said that fears over bird flu so far
appeared unfounded.
"The 1st tests have returned negative for H5N1," he said in a
telephone interview, referring to the strain of bird flu that has
been deadly in humans.
Unlike its hard-hit neighbors Viet Nam and Thailand, Cambodia has so
far managed to avoid the worst impact of the disease, although
thousands of birds have died, and there have been 4 confirmed human fatalities.
However, despite efforts by Cambodian authorities to limit poultry
crossing into the country, farmers have taken advantage of cheap
poultry available from nearby Viet Nam. Crackdowns and restrictions
and fear of an epidemic have caused Vietnamese farmers to sell
massive lots of their stock.
Cambodian authorities have set up a regional hotline and urged
farmers to report any unexplained deaths in their poultry flocks.
Authorities moved quickly to inspect the latest report, particularly
because Kampong Speu lies close to the border of the capital, Phnom Penh.
Kimhong said despite having an initial clean bill of health, the dead
ducks, which were being raised for meat, were banned for human
consumption and had been buried in massive pits near the farms they died on.

[In the absence of details, such as age, time after importation,
clinical and PM findings, it is difficult to assess the possible
etiologies of this mass (40 percent) mortality or to definitely
exclude avian influenza. Differential diagnosis might include other
infectious diseases, such as Newcastle disease, Duck virus enteritis
and Duck virus hepatitis. Non-infectious diseases are also to be
excluded. The imported ducks might have been infected prior to or
during transportation. However, there is also another possible
scenario: their post-import exposure to an endemic disease to which
they are susceptible (see 20050927.2840). Results of the laboratory
investigations will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
