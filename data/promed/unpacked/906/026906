Delays in treatment of sea-lice infestations on salmon farms in the Broughton Archipelago in 2015 may have contributed to the transfer of the parasites to wild fish, according to a new study.

While some farms applied parasiticides during the winter, others didn't treat for sea lice until just before or during the wild-fish out-migration months later.

Last year's [2015] sea-lice outbreak was a perfect storm of events, starting with the transfer of sea lice from hyper-abundant wild pink salmon to ocean-based salmon farms in 2014, according to the study's lead author Stephanie Peacock.

Unusually warm seas in early 2015 created ideal growing conditions for sea lice and a management challenge for fish farms.

"The number of sea lice we observed on wild juvenile salmon and the proportion of juvenile salmon that were infected were significantly higher in 2015 than the period from 2006 to 2014," she said. "There were high numbers of sea lice all along the B.C. coast last year [2015]."

Wild fluctuations in sea-lice infestations on wild pinks and chum salmon between 2001 and 2005 gave way to a decade of low sea-lice levels, until last year [2015].

"We have seen very low numbers since 2006, and we were thinking maybe we've figured (sea-lice management) out," she said.

Peacock and fellow University of Toronto post-doctoral researcher Andrew Bateman analyzed data collected since 2001 under the direction of independent scientist Alexandra Morton, a co-author of the study.

Juvenile wild salmon are naturally protected from the transfer of sea lice from returning pinks, she said.

"Sea lice get transferred to farmed salmon in the fall; they overwinter on the salmon and get transferred to wild salmon in the spring," she said. "Ordinarily the returning pinks and out-migrating wild salmon would never come in contact."

Sea-lice numbers on salmon farms were higher in 2015 compared with the recent past, according to data from Fisheries and Oceans Canada.

The researchers also found that the proportion of precautionary winter treatments on farms had dropped and the number of farms treating during the wild-salmon migration had increased.

"There seemed to be a period during which farms appeared to be hosting large numbers of sea lice," she said.

The authors conclude that in addition to sea-lice management thresholds, the industry should consider area-wide management to prevent farms from re-infecting each other when treatments are months apart.

"Last year [2015], there were some specific circumstances that led to increases in sea-lice abundance across the board, including areas where there are no fish farms," said Crawford Revie, a Canada Research Chair and professor at the Atlantic Veterinary College at the University of P.E.I. "Warm temperatures, high salinity and large returns of (infested) pinks were the main factors."

Crawford is skeptical that fish farmers would purposely delay treatments.

"These farmers know better than anybody that you have to get on top of these things," he said. "They don't play Russian roulette with sea lice."

Jeremy Dunn, executive director of the B.C. Salmon Farmers Association, was pleased that the study found sea-lice treatments employed by the industry continue to be effective.

Farmers are experimenting with alternative pest treatments such as hydrogen peroxide, as well as integrated pest-management systems as a way to minimize the use of chemical treatments such as Slice, said Dunn.

The association plans to invite the study's supervising professor, Martin Krkosek, to present the study to its research forum in February [2017], he said.

[Sea lice are small copepods of the family Caligidae (crustaceans) which live on fish. They are external parasites that feed on the mucus, epidermal tissue and blood of host marine fish.

Sea lice cause physical and enzymatic damage at their sites of attachment and feeding which results in abrasion-like lesions that vary in their nature and severity depending upon a number of factors, one of which is the sea louse species involved (there are around 560 sea louse species).

The scientific article referred to can be accessed at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.1438/full. In the Pacific coast of Canada, farmed salmon act as reservoir hosts for the sea lice _Lepeophtheirus salmonis_ and _Caligus clemensi_ that can transmit to migrating wild salmon.
