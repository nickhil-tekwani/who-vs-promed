FOOT & MOUTH DISEASE - BRAZIL (AMAZONAS) (06)

Although I can understand and appreciate the interest with which the
scientific community is looking into the notification of a foot and mouth
disease (FMD) virus C outbreak in the Amazon, I would like to stress that
this is no real surprise to the Brazilian Animal Health Authorities.
Over the last few years, they have resisted the withdrawal of the "C" from
the vaccine. The argument has always been that because part of the northern
region of Brazil has a very weak surveillance system, one cannot be sure
that there is no viral activity of any type in that region. They have
always preferred to be safe than sorry.
It is no coincidence that the region has consistently been kept out of the
Free Zone with Vaccination, despite the absence of notified outbreaks for 3
years. Within the context of the national risk rating used by the Ministry
of Agriculture, most of the northern region is -- and has always been --
classified under "unknown risk".
In my view, the recent events add credibility to the efforts to strengthen
the FMD surveillance system in the northern region. Obviously, this is not
to say that the scientific community should not look into other
possibilities, wildlife or others, but one should be very careful before
trying to find complex explanations for what may be a more straightforward
problem of surveillance infrastructure and vaccination coverage.
