Foot & mouth disease [FMD] - Turkey
----------------------
Information received on [and dated] 16 Nov 2015 from Prof. Dr Irfan Erol, Director General of Food and Control, Directorate of Food and Control, Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock, Ankara, Turkey

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 29 Sep 2015
Date of confirmation of the event: 5 Oct 2015
Reason for notification: new strain of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: food and mouth disease virus (genotype VII)
Serotype: A
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Buzhane, Van
Date of start of the outbreak: 29 Sep 2015
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 2346 / 40 / 0 / 0 / 0

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, in percentages]:
Species / morbidity rate / mortality rate / case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 1.71 / 0 / 0 / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Illegal movement of animals; contact with infected animal(s) at grazing/watering; fomites (humans, vehicles, feed, etc.)

Epidemiological comments: An unnamed strain of type A was detected as a result of VP1 sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Then the sample was sent to the Pirbright Institute for analysis. The Pirbright Institute termed this strain as "Genotype VII" in the FMD Genotyping Report dated 16 Nov 2015.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, disinfection/disinfestation, quarantine, surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
FMD Institute (national laboratory) / Cattle / gene sequencing / 14 Oct 2015 / Positive
FMD Institute (national laboratory) / Cattle / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 5 Nov 2015 / Positive
The Pirbright Institute (United Kingdom) (OIE Reference Laboratory) / Cattle / gene sequencing / 16 Nov 2015 / Positive

[The above confirming notification to the OIE was expected since the publication, by EUFMD on 7 Nov 2015, of a Turkish-sourced report addressing a new FMD outbreak in the provinces Van and Bitlis in Eastern Turkey caused by a "new strain" of FMD virus serotype A, which was claimed to be "close to the one existing in Saudi Arabia in the rate of 99 per cent and to the one in India in the rate of more than 99 per cent." (See posting 20151107.3772559). The current notification mentions Van only; it would be interesting to know whether the outbreak in Bitlis has or has not not been confirmed.

According to the information available on the website of the world reference laboratory for FMD at Pirbright (WRLFMD), a sample from Saudi Arabia, signed "15/09/2015 A SAU/1/2015," was received on 15 Sep 2015. It included 2 samples; both were serotyped A and -- according to the information currently available on the website -- belong to topotype "Asia," while the lineage is "unnamed." The full report, with genotyping results and a list of reference/close FMDV-A strains, is not yet available on the website. On 19 and 23 Oct 2015, 2 additional samples were received, their serotyping is reportedly "pending" at present (http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/me/sau.htm).

According to the current official notification from Turkey, the world reference laboratory at Pirbright has completed the genotyping of the submitted strain (topotype Asia) and termed it as "Genotype VII." The genotyping results of this "new" strain are not yet available on the web-site of the WRLFMD; such report, and particularly the comparison of FMDV-A topotype Asia, genotype VII, to other field strains and to available reference (vaccine) strains, is anticipated as soon as the agreement for its publication is obtained from the submitter, Turkey.

In their 6 Nov 2015 report to EUFMD, the Turkish authorities wrote: "Our FMD institute produced vaccine for this new strain. Within 15 days, these vaccines will be used in outbreaks and risky areas." In the current OIE report, the list of applied control measures includes "no vaccination," and the article "Measures to be applied" says "no other measures." The vaccine issue deserves an update. - Mods.AS/CRD
