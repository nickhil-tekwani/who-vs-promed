Aspergillus crown rot is on the rise in Georgia peanut fields and University of Georgia [UGA] researchers are working to pinpoint why. At present, scientists recommend that farmers stop saving seed from year to year to reduce the disease. If researchers can't determine why treatments are not working as consistently as they used to, the problem will only worsen, UGA's Tim Brenneman said.

Growers traditionally rely on fungicide treatment applied to commercial peanut seed to combat the disease. For extra protection, they use in-furrow fungicides. "This year [2017], in-furrow treatment alone led to nearly a complete wipeout," Brenneman said. Growers sometimes see more erratic control from chemical applications. He is studying why this haphazard control seems to be the case.

"The pathogen is in the soil [and] can be housed in the seed itself and grow into the hypocotyl, the portion of the plant just below the soil line. The fungus can quickly destroy this tissue [and] the plant dies very quickly," Brenneman said. "We need to understand more about how the fungus can infect and be in the seed through storage." Anything that is going to stress the plant increases the likelihood that a disease like crown rot will be able to attack and kill it.

[Crown rot of peanut caused by the fungus _Aspergillus niger_ leads to damping off, sudden wilting and blight of seedlings, with death of the plants up to 5 weeks after planting. Symptoms often occur scattered throughout fields; they may include dark brown discolouration on decayed roots and hypocotyls; later, masses of black spores appear in these areas. The fungus can also cause branch wilting in older plants. While the pathogen is present in most soils, disease development is favoured by environmental stress factors, insect damage providing entry points for spores and poor seed quality. Up to 50 per cent crop losses due to crown rot have been reported.

The fungus can be spread with soil, water, infected plant and other materials, on air currents or by mechanical means (including insect activity). It also is a frequent contaminant of peanut seed and has significance as post-harvest pathogen. Disease management relies mainly on fungicide seed treatments (as mentioned above), but may also include cultural practices to manage soil moisture and improve plant vigour, as well as control of insect pests to reduce spread. All commercial peanut varieties are susceptible. _A. niger_ does not produce mycotoxins, but contamination of harvested kernels with aflatoxin is mostly due to the related species _A. flavus_.

The increased incidence of crown rot and decreased efficiency of chemical control measures reported above may point towards new pathogen strains emerging in the region. Molecular work will be needed to investigate this possibility.
