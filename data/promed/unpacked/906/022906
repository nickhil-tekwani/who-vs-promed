From: Sergio Sosa Estani <ssosa@msal.gov.ar> [translated by Mod.JW]

Since the end of July and the beginning of August [2002], in San Pedro,
Misiones Province, an increase has been seen in consultations for a benign
febrile respiratory syndrome, which at first affected school age children
but later spread to adults in the household, who had milder symptoms.
A total of 890 cases have been seen up to 26 Aug 2002. A team from the
Epidemiology Directorate (PRESEC Residencia de Epid de Campo-VIGIA) and the
Malbran Institute [for Infectious Diseases], both belonging to the Health
Ministry, assisted the local health team. An investigation was carried out
and samples were taken for lab tests. Serological tests for dengue were
negative. Aedes [mosquito] infestation indices did not indicate any risk of
dengue transmission. (This information was provided by Vector Control
personnel).
The results to date are from the rapid diagnostic test on nasal and
pharyngeal swabs. Of 18 patients studied, 6 were positive for influenza
type B (direct immunofluorescence). This indicates recent infection by the
virus. Virus isolation in cell culture and serological tests are in progress.
