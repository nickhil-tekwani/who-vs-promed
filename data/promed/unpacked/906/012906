Mysterious illness kills 64 in southwestern Somalia
---------------------------------------------------
Location: Hudur, Somalia

An unidentified disease has killed at least 64 people, mainly women
and children, in villages in the southwestern Somali region of Bakool
over the past 3 days, elders confirmed on Thursday [19 May 2011].

The elders said there are no health facilities in the affected
villages of Yoonkoy and Busti around the region's provincial capital
of Hudur, which is about 430 km [267 miles] southwest of Mogadishu.

An elder in the region, Omar Isak Madey, told the media Thursday that
the strange illness emerged at the beginning of the week and people
began dying within 48 hours after becoming infected. "This is a
humanitarian disaster we have never seen before so we are calling for
emergency life saving medical assistance," Madey said during a
telephone press conference. "There is a terrible condition here,
people are dying and we cannot do anything to save them," the elder
lamented.

Most cities and towns in the Bakool region including the provincial
capital are under the control of Al-Shabaab militants who have banned
international aid agencies from the region.

[It is impossible to discern the cause of this apparent outbreak
without further information. Enteric infections, including cholera,
other bacterial diarrheas or foodborne illness, influenza and a
variety of other respiratory viral infections could be involved.
Further details from anyone with information from this region would be
welcome. - Mod.LM]

[Re the similar outbreak in the same locality in 1999 (see ProMED
ref. below), I commented at that time "Sounds like the usual
unfortunate multiple cause outbreak in an aggravated sanitary
situation."
