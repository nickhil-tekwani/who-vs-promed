Outbreak associated with _Streptococcus suis_ in pigs in China: Update
---------------------------------------------------
As China moves towards concluding its investigation into the recent
outbreak in Sichuan Province associated with _Streptococcus suis_ in pigs,
the Ministry of Health of China has shared more details with WHO about the
outbreak. A group of international specialists on _Streptococcus suis_
convened by WHO has assessed, based on the information provided by the
Ministry of Health, that the outbreak in humans is compatible with _S.
suis_ etiology.
Further Details of the Investigation
------------------------------------
To date, the Ministry of Health of China has reported 215 cases of human
disease associated with the outbreak. Of these human cases, 39 have been
fatal. No new cases have been reported since 5 Aug 2005. The data provided
by China depict an outbreak that peaked from the 2nd through the 4th week
of Jul 2005, and dwindled rapidly thereafter. Authorities say several
human cases were discovered retrospectively, once the epidemiological
investigation was underway.
The initial cases were suspected of having hemorrhagic fever with renal
syndrome, but laboratory tests ruled that out. More cases were reported,
with a range of clinical presentations -- high fever, malaise, nausea and
vomiting, followed by meningitis, subcutaneous hemorrhage, toxic shock and
coma in severe cases. Nearly all of the patients were reported to be local
farmers and butchers by profession, about 80 percent of them men, who had
been killing sick pigs or processing and selling the meat. More than 40
percent of the cases were aged between 50 to 60 years.
Subsequently, laboratory tests on several of the human samples confirmed
infection with _S. suis_ serotype 2. A concurrent investigation by the
Ministry of Agriculture of China discovered the presence of _S. suis_
serotype 2 in pigs in the area. Authorities say tests on human samples
have not shown the presence of any other bacterial agent. A viral etiology
was also considered in pigs, and both influenza and Nipah virus infections
were reported to have been ruled out.
Authorities add that, based on their investigation so far, there is no
evidence of human-to-human transmission, and no healthcare workers tending
to the patients have been infected. The Ministry of Health says further
study is still needed, however, to try to determine why this outbreak was
so large, including so many fatalities, especially compared to previous
outbreaks in recent years.
Current Assessment by International Specialists
------------------------------------------------
A group of international specialists on _S. suis_, including WHO technical
staff, held a teleconference on 9 Aug 2005 to discuss this outbreak.
Overall, the specialists expressed no concern related to the validity of
the laboratory identification of _S. suis_ serotype 2. The clinical
picture, they felt, could be explained by a strain or strains of _S. suis_
with a higher virulence in humans.
The specialists reiterated that _S. suis_ is a relatively rare disease in
humans. It was first identified in humans in the 1960s, and few outbreaks
in humans have been reported around the world since then. Even though the
_S. suis_ genome has been sequenced globally, the specialists noted, the
function of 20 percent to 30 percent of the genome is still unclear.
The specialists suggested that further testing on samples from the Sichuan
outbreak might be helpful, as would comparisons between the strain
associated with this outbreak and strains linked to other occurrences in
the past in China and other countries. Chinese authorities have indicated
that they are keen for such studies to be conducted.
The specialists also noted the lack of epidemiology to suggest
person-to-person spread in the present outbreak -- including the absence of
cases among children -- and considered this reassuring. They said
person-to-person transmission was unlikely unless there was very close
contact with infected material such as blood (something that would almost
only occur in hospital settings).
The group reiterated that although consumption of raw or undercooked pork
may lead to disease, eating properly cooked pork is unlikely to represent
an increased risk, even if the strain of _S. suis_ involved is more
virulent. This outbreak once again raises the wider global issue of the
links between -- on the one hand -- food safety, animal husbandry and
slaughtering practices (especially in poor, backyard farms and rural
areas), and, on the other hand, an ever-growing range of zoonotic diseases.
Regarding a possible national and international spread of the outbreak, the
specialists concurred with the Chinese authorities that the movements of
live pigs, and the trade of pig carcasses and meat within and from the
outbreak area, had to be carefully regulated and monitored. China says it
has put strict measures in place to ensure this.
The Ministry of Health has provided WHO with regular updates through the
course of this outbreak. WHO will continue to monitor the situation, and
is pleased to offer the Ministry of Health of China its support.
