Equine encephalitis alert issued
--------------------------------
The Ministry of Health has issued an alert for the community of San
Miguelito due to an outbreak of equine encephalitis in other regions of the
country, especially in the Darien.

The disease has been detected in a number of horses, and so far in 5
children all from the Darien. So far, one of them has died from the disease
while 3 others are hospitalized. [What happened to the 5th child? - Mod.TG]

Officials from the ministry said they have been intensively spraying to
control mosquitoes, which spread the disease, in areas where outbreaks have
occurred. They have also been giving vaccines to horses to prevent the
spread of the disease.

Officials said people with horses in the communities of Mayor Diaz and
Chilibre should be especially careful and regularly inspect their livestock
for any sign of the disease.

To this point, no cases of equine encephalitis have been detected in the
capital.

[Although the article does not specifically say which type of equine
encephalitis is involved, it is likely Venezuelan equine encephalitis
(VEE). This particular virus, caused by a virus in the family _Togaviridae_
genus _Alphavirus_ is more prone to cause human fatalities than the eastern
equine or western equine encephalitides.

Darien, in the southern region of Panama, has had VEE previously, but it
seems to be a re-emerging mosquitoborne disease. Previously, the VEE virus
strains isolated belonged to an enzootic, subtype ID lineage known to
circulate among sylvatic vectors and rodent reservoir hosts in Panama and
Peru. While there are other strains, this article did not give any
information regarding the strain. However, the subtype ID was known to
cause human fatalities as recently as 2004 in Darien.

Human VEEV is very difficult to distinguish clinically from dengue and
other sub-tropical viral disease, such as malaria. Laboratory diagnostics
are required to confirm specifically which disease is present.
Consequently, VEEV may go unreported, until it has reached an explosive
state, or has corresponding equine involvement that is recognized and
reported. Darien is a sparsely populated region of Panama, and is more
forest and swamps, promoting mosquito populations, generally _Culex_ spp.
This also contributes to difficulty in assessing the presence of the virus
and the possible cause for underreporting. So mosquito control is very
needed in the surrounding areas.

Humans having clinical signs including headache, fever, retrobulbar pain,
tremors, and evidence of neurological involvement should have VEE included
in the differentials, especially in Panama.

As VEE is currently considered a re-emerging disease of both human and
animal importance, it is worth noting that it exploded with a vengeance in
1969-1971, making its way up Central America, into Mexico and Texas.
Explosions of the virus, such as the one in 1969-1971, involve many
different species of mosquitoes. Also, equine disease is rarely associated
with infection by sylvatic VEE viruses.

Since the article does not tell us much about the strain of virus, it is
not possible at this point to know if this strain is the sylvatic strain or
the epizootic strain. While equine disease is rarely associated with the
sylvatic strain, it nevertheless bears close watching, should this be the
sylvatic strain that has moved into horses.

Horses bitten by an infected mosquito begin to show signs between a half
day to 5 days later. Clinical signs of the infections range from
asymptomatic, to mild (anorexia, fever), or severe either with fatality or
without. Horses with a severe response show a distinctive lack of
coordination that leads to a "leaning stance" and circling because the
brain is swelling. Other clinical signs include fever, lack of appetite
(anorexia) with rapid weight loss, and depression, which may include
seizures. Horses experiencing seizures often beat themselves up and may
cause extensive injury to themselves, depending upon what they may thrash
against. Most horses experiencing seizures have some degree of cuts and
scrapes, especially around the head and neck. Horses may die from the
trauma of the seizures. However, epizootic occurrences of the virus may
cause mortality in horses between 50 and 90 per cent. Recovery is rare and
euthanasia is usually the course of action.

Horse owners should be vaccinating their horses, in addition to practicing
mosquito control. Horse owners should be constantly vigilant to observe
their animals, looking for signs of anorexia, fever, walking in circles,
pressing their head against objects, trembling, and seizures - Mod.TG
