In response to the moderator's comment (Plague, prairie dogs - USA (CO):
alert 20030809.1973): "Cats and other mammals occasionally become infected
via the same mechanism as humans", while it is true cats can become
infected through flea bite, most cats acquire plague through ingesting
plague-infected rodents. Flea control on pets is recommended to prevent
those pets from bringing plague-infected fleas into the home, but cats that
hunt can still become infected with plague and serve as a source of human
infection.

Some flea control products just prevent the fleas from reproducing, they
don't kill the fleas that are on the animal. In areas where plague is a
concern, owners should be sure to use a product that kills fleas.

[If you are uncertain if the active ingredient in your flea control product
kills fleas, check with your veterinarian. Also, make sure the product you
select is safe for cats if you intend to use the product on your cats. Â­
