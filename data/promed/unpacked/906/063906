3 suspected cutaneous anthrax cases have been reported in the
Ordabasinkstaya rayon [Ordabasy District] of the South Kazakhstan
oblast according to the Ministry of Health of the Kazakh Republic. All
3 cases sought medical help after participating in an animal
slaughtering in a backyard. It became clear that the animal had been
immunized against anthrax.

A team of healthcare workers and veterinarians went to the place to
carry out an investigation. Samples have been taken for tests.

[Anthrax occurs all around Kazakhstan, as the centre is a desert, and
there is a measure of under-reporting, as the rural areas are poorly
served by medical and veterinary services. It is not unusual see some
dozen human cases reported, such as these, each year.

The fact that this animal had been "vaccinated" does raise some
doubts about the preliminary diagnosis, as the Kazakh livestock
vaccine is potent. That the investigation team included medics and
veterinarians makes me confident in whatever conclusion they come to.
This is because a confirmatory diagnosis of cutaneous anthrax is
tentative at best but straightforward when there is access to a
suspect carcass. - Mod.MHJ]
