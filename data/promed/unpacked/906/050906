While this is speculation on my part, it seems possible, so here goes...
This undiagnosed pneumonia, sporadic, not transmitted from person to
person, desert conditions, and vaguely similar desert conditions to here in
Phoenix, Arizona.
I wonder whether the etiology might possibly be "valley fever," i.e.,
_Coccidioides immitis_, as seen here in the Southwest. Has this been
seriously looked into?

Further to comments about melioidosis as a possible etiology for the
undiagnosed respiratory infections reported in Iraq recently, the following
historical and geographical information may be of use.
Pulmonary melioidosis was first reported from neighbouring Iran in the
French literature in 1977 (1). Environmental studies around that time
indicated the presence of _B. pseudomallei_ (then known as _Pseudomonas
pseudomallei_) in the rice-growing area south of the Caspian Sea (2). _B.
pseudomallei_ has caused disease there in ungulates and was found in the
grounds of the Palace of Darius in Persepolis.
Though melioidosis does not appear to have been reported from Iraq, rice is
a significant crop (3). Other cereals grown there depend on irrigation
systems that may have been disrupted by recent conflict. If _B.
pseudomallei_ were present in the soil or surface water, the disturbance
caused by excavation or rebuilding would be a potential means of human
exposure.

[ProMED would like to thank Drs Barbour and Inglis for their comments. I do
not believe that coccidioidomycosis has been described in the Middle
East. Although to me in New York, one desert looks like another, the Iraqi
landscape may not represent the lower Sonoran life zone. Blastomycosis has
apparently been reported in the Middle East. We would appreciate any
additional information about the dimorphic environmental mycoses in the
Middle East. Regarding melioidosis, I think if all the 13 cases (2 were
pneumococcal) were due to _B. pseudomallei_, some of the cases would have
had the organism grown from respiratory secretions. - Mod.LL]
