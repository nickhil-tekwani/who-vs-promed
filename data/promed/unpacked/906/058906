Influenza A(H1N1) - update 8.1 -- 1 May 2009
-------------
The situation continues to evolve. As of 23:30
GMT, 1 May 2009, 13 countries have officially
reported 367 cases of influenza A(H1N1) infection.

The United States Government has reported 141
laboratory confirmed human cases, including one
death. Mexico has reported 156 confirmed human
cases of infection, including 9 deaths.

The following countries have reported laboratory
confirmed cases with no deaths - Austria (1),
Canada (34), China, Hong Kong, Special
Administrative Region (1), Denmark (1), Germany
(4), Israel (2), Netherlands (1), New Zealand
(4), Spain (13), Switzerland (1) and the United
Kingdom (8).

Further information on the situation will be
available on the WHO website on a regular basis.

WHO advises no restriction of regular travel or
closure of borders. It is considered prudent for
people who are ill to delay international travel
and for people developing symptoms following
international travel to seek medical attention,
in line with guidance from national authorities.

There is also no risk of infection from this
virus from consumption of well-cooked pork and
pork products. Individuals are advised to wash
hands thoroughly with soap and water on a regular
basis and should seek medical attention if they
develop any symptoms of influenza-like illness.

Influenza cases by a new sub-type: Regional Update (May 1, 2009 )
Epidemiological Alert Update. Influenza A (H1N1) Regional Report (1 May 2009)
-------------------------
To date, the United States has confirmed a total
of 141 human cases of influenza A (H1N1): 4 in
Arizona, 13 in California, 2 in Colorado, 4 in
Delaware, 3 in Illinois, 3 in Indiana, 2 in
Kansas, 1 in Kentucky, 2 in Massachusetts, 2 in
Michigan, 1 in Minnesota, 1 in Nebraska, 1 in
Nevada, 5 in New Jersey, 50 in New York, 1 in
Ohio, 16 in South Carolina, 28 in Texas and 2 in
Virginia. Other suspected cases are being
investigated. 6 hospitalizations and a death have
been registered. The dead case is a child of 22
months old. The age range of the confirmed cases
is from 22 months to 81 years (a median of 16
years). The most recent cases detected as well as
the registered death suggest that more serious
cases could appear in the United States.

From [17 to 30 Apr 2009], Mexico has reported
2387 suspected cases of influenza with severe
pneumonia including 92 deaths. The suspected
cases were recorded in all Mexican states. The
most affected are: Aguascalientes, Baja
California Sur, Distrito Federal, Durango, Estado
de México and San Luís Potosí. The majority of
these have occurred in previously healthy young
adult people. There have been few cases in
individuals under 3 or over 59 years old. 982 of
the suspected cases have required hospitalization.

The number of probable cases of influenza A
(H1N1) is 528. 156 cases have been confirmed,
with 7 death cases among them. The considerable
variation in the number of confirmed cases as of
today is due to the recent laboratory
confirmation of samples collected in previous
weeks.

In Canada, to date 34 human cases of influenza A
(H1N1) have been confirmed (6 in Alberta, 8 in
the province of New Scotland, 11 in British
Columbia, 1 in Quebec and 8 in Ontario) some of
them with recent trip history to Cancun, Mexico.
All the cases developed a mild form of influenza
like illness. 2 of the cases presented, in
addition, gastrointestinal symptoms. All of them
are currently recovered and none required
hospitalization. Laboratory tests were conducted
in Winnipeg, Canada. `Indigenous` transmission is
not discarded since not all the confirmed cases
have trip history to Mexico

The press has reported information on suspected
cases in several countries of the Region; however
this information has not been confirmed.
