Patients may have been exposed to HIV and hepatitis at Florida hospital
----------------------------------------------------------------------
More than 1800 patients treated by one nurse at a South Florida
hospital may have been exposed to HIV [human immunodeficiency virus]
and hepatitis [B and C virus infection].

Broward General Medical Center said Monday [5 Oct 2009] that a nurse
reused saline bags and tubing during cardiac stress tests involving
the injection of fluids. The hospital has sent letters to all 1851
people who may've been affected between January 2004 and early
September [2009?]. Hospital officials say the risk of exposure is low,
but all affected patients should be tested for HIV and hepatitis B and
C [virus infection].

The nurse, who has not been identified, resigned and was reported to
the Board of Nursing. The hospital discovered the problem after a
patient noticed the nurse misusing the equipment and anonymously
called in.

[The risk of transmission of infection in this incident would seem to
be low since apparently the 1st patients were exposed as long ago as
2004 and no cases of infection have been identified up to the present.
The extent of exposure, involving reuse of saline bags and tubing by a
single nurse, is also likely to have been low compared with other
incidents where there has been direct transmission of blood or re-use
of contaminated needles and syringes. However continued vigilance is
clearly necessary.
