The South Sulawesi governor and the family of the latest confirmed
bird flu victim expressed regret Friday that the Health Ministry did
not immediately disclose the cause of the 14-year-old's death.

Health Minister Siti Fadilah Supari said Thursday the government had
confirmed the girl, who passed away almost 3 months ago, was the 48th
fatality from the virus.

"Why was the announcement made almost 3 months later? If we had known
earlier, we could have taken the necessary steps immediately,"
Governor Amin Syam said in Makassar on Friday.

The victim's brother said his family had been shocked to learn the
girl died of bird flu. "It has really shaken us, to hear such news
just as we were coming to terms with her death."

He said the family knew that bird flu in humans caused symptoms like
the girl's, including a high fever, chest pains and shortness of
breath. However, her doctor had diagnosed dengue fever. "But our
suspicion caused us to free all our chickens and pet birds and
destroy the coop and cages immediately after her funeral."

The victim was the 48th person to have died of bird flu in the
country, but it was the first case to occur in South Sulawesi.

Laboratory tests conducted by the Health Ministry on fluid samples
taken from the victim concluded she died of the H5N1 bird flu virus
strain. The samples were sent by the provincial health office to
Jakarta on 23 Jun 2006, the day before the girl died. However, the
test results were only announced Thursday.

Runizar Roesin from the National Bird Flu Center said the delay
between the discovery of the case and the announcement of the test
results was because the samples were not specifically taken from the
patient on suspicion of bird flu.

Siti said they would soon carry out poultry culls in the area where
the case was found.

The girl's mother and elder sister, both of whom exhibited bird flu
symptoms, died before her. After her death, her father, 2 other
siblings, an in-law and a cousin were in turns taken to the hospital
with high fevers, but soon recovered.

Alidin said the family had suspected the 3 died of bird flu but could
not confirm the matter since they were all diagnosed as suffering
from dengue fever.

The head of the South Sulawesi Health Office, Andi Muhadir, said it
was unwise to make assumptions but blood samples would be taken from
the victim's 11 family members and her closest neighbors.

The governor has called on related offices to apply standard
procedures in dealing with bird flu and asked residents to hand over
their poultry to be destroyed. "I hope people are willing to give up
their poultry to be destroyed so there will be no more cases of bird
flu in humans," he said.

[The case above is a vivid reminder that avian influenza mortalities
and loss of poultry are not just numbers, but situations that
adversely affect real people.

Dealing with a dispersed epidemic in Indonesia presents a formidable
challenge to human and animal health authorities. Indonesia has an
area of 1 904 443 sq km spread over 13 000 islands with a human
population of over 241 million (2005 census). Many villages are
remote with limited access and communications. Poultry, especially
backyard flocks, occur throughout the country. Operating a
surveillance system for rapid detection of avian influenza, adequate
laboratory support with timely feedback of results to local
government health and veterinary officials and practicing physicians
in an environment such as this is daunting indeed.

The cases outlined above illustrate the need for practicing
physicians to be aware of the kinds of febrile diseases circulating
in the country, especially high-priority ones such as avian influenza
and the related differential diagnoses. One hopes that the
dengue-avian influenza scene is not further complicated by the
arrival of chikungunya virus.

Culling widely dispersed poultry populations is not logistically
easy, and requires the cooperation of villagers. If indemnities are
not paid, or are lower than market prices, that collaboration is not
likely to succeed, and birds may be moved or hidden, spreading the
infection. A comprehensive education, surveillance, diagnostic
laboratory, and field control program throughout such a large area
would be extraordinarily expensive.
