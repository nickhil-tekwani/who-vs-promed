Uganda: Masindi killer disease is not meningitis
------------------------------------------------
Medical authorities in Masindi have ruled out meningitis as the cause of
the recent deaths in Mutunda sub-county, Kibanda county.
Seven people, including 5 from one family and a neighbor, have died since
an outbreak was reported in Kajebe village about 3 weeks ago. "There are
only 2 meningitis cases in the district, and those are recovering at
Kiryandongo Hospital, but the disease that is killing our people is elusive
and highly contagious," Dr John Turyagaruka, the district health officer,
said on Saturday [24 Feb 2006]. He was addressing an emergency epidemic
control task force meeting chaired by the district vice-chairperson, Jacob
Karubanga, at the district chambers. The task force has surveillance, case
management, logistics, mobilization and coordination departments.
Up to 110 people have died of meningitis in West Nile and Kotido district,
out of about 3000 reported cases, since the epidemic broke out early this
month [February 2007]. It has left schools, markets and disco halls closed
in 6 districts.

[In the absence of information on the clinical syndromes associated with
these unexpected deaths in Uganda, it would be exceedingly hazardous to
attempt a differential diagnosis of possible etiologies. More information
on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated.
