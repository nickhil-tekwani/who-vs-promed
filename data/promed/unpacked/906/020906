Brazil: 1st Case of Hantavirus Infection in the Capital of Minas Gerais
-------------------------------------------------
Greater Belo Horizonte [the capital of Minas Gerais state] has had its 1st
case of hantavirus infection, which is spread in the urine and feces of
wild rodents. A 41-year-old male resident of the rural area of Betim was
first diagnosed as having dengue fever, but tests carried out by the
Institute Adolfo Lutz in Sao Paulo confirmed hantavirus infection. The
State Health Secretariat is examining contacts of the case to see whether
there have been other cases [the disease is not spread person-to-person,
but people living in the same area may have been exposed to the same source
- Mod.JW], and giving talks on how to prevent infection. The patient has
made a full recovery.
