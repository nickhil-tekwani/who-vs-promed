Egypt: Large outbreak of hepatitis A in tourists staying at a hotel in
Hurghada in 2004; orange juice implicated
-----------------------------------------
In August and September 2004, a large outbreak of hepatitis A occurred
involving tourists staying at a specific hotel (hotel X) in the Egyptian
resort of Hurghada. A total of 351 cases associated with this outbreak came to
the attention of the Robert Koch-Institut (RKI): 271 primary and 7 secondary
infections reported in Germany, and 60 primary and 13 secondary infections
which were reported via the national public health institutes of 8 other
European countries.
Descriptive epidemiology, Germany
---------------------------------
In Germany, primary cases were defined as having been guests of the implicated
hotel between June and August [2004], with laboratory confirmation of recent
hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection (n=8), clinical evidence of hepatitis A
(n=5) or both (n=258). Patient ages ranged from 2 to 67 years (median 34
years), and 54 percent were male. No deaths were reported, but some patients
were very ill and needed prolonged convalescence. 2 patients reported having
been immunised against HAV before travel, one with 2 doses and the other with
a full course (3 doses) of the hepatitis A and B combination vaccine in 2003.
Patients had stayed at the hotel in Egypt between 9 Jun and 8 Aug, 2004. Their
length of stay varied from 6 to 21 days. The minimum period during which
infections could have occurred was 24 Jun to 23 Jul 2004. The infection source
must have been present during this time, although possibly intermittently. No
more than 52 percent of the infected guests stayed together at the hotel on
any single day. Dates of symptom-onset were between 10 Jul and 8 Sep 2004. The
period from median day of hotel stay to onset of illness was between 7 and 62
days (median: 30 days).
Other affected countries
------------------------
The RKI informed other European countries in August about the outbreak via the
European Union's Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) and reports in
Eurosurveillance Weekly [1,2]. The European Programme for Intervention
Epidemiology Training (EPIET) was invited to join the investigation and
provided a network of contacts to other potentially affected countries in this
outbreak. The following European countries reported primary cases associated
with this outbreak: Austria (18), Sweden (10), Denmark (9), the Netherlands
(9), Belgium (6), the United Kingdom (5), Italy (2) and Switzerland (1).
Secondary cases were noted only in Austria, where an outbreak with 13 cases
occurred due to an infected tourist who returned to her job in commercial food
preparation after staying at the hotel [3].
Case-control study of German patients
-------------------------------------
To identify the source(s) of infection in this outbreak, the RKI conducted a
case-control study together with the state and local health authorities of
Baden-Wuerttemberg, Hesse, and North Rhine-Westphalia. Based on the
information provided by the hotel management, the following hypotheses
regarding possible vehicles of infection were developed: consumption of ice
cream, salads/raw vegetables and/or juices served mainly for breakfast.
Information supplied by patients (18 years or older) who had stayed at the
hotel during the minimum period of infection, was compared with that provided
by healthy hotel guests (controls, i.e. guests 18 years or older and not
registered as cases, who had not been vaccinated against hepatitis A virus and
reported no previous infection). The information concerned foods and drinks
consumed, as well as various holiday activities. Only one person per household
was interviewed via telephone.
69 cases and 36 controls were included in the statistical analysis, all of
whom had stayed at least one day at hotel X between 24 Jun and 23 Jul 2004.
Patients and controls did not differ significantly in age, sex, trips, bathing
habits, in their consumption of ice cream or salads, or a number of other
queried aspects. They did differ significantly with respect to whether they
drank fruit juice served at the hotel breakfast buffet (82 percent of cases
but only 64 percent of controls). Guests who developed hepatitis A disease
after vacation were 2.6 times more likely to have drunk the juice than
controls (95 percent CI: 1.1-6.6). Regarding the number of days on which cases
and controls drank orange juice, a statistically significant dose-response
relationship emerged [supplemented by a figure in the original text].
Consumption of grapefruit juice was also associated with an increased risk of
disease: 32 percent of cases, but only 17 percent of controls remembered
drinking it (d!
ifference not statistically significant).
Laboratory and environmental investigations
-------------------------------------------
Genome sequences of hepatitis A virus (HAV) isolated from 13 German cases were
found to be identical (HAV genotype 1B). None of the hotel staff in Egypt were
anti-HAV IgM-positive, making it unlikely that an infected employee was the
source of infections. The Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population focused
its investigation on the hotel's suppliers. Independently of the case-control
study results, the juice supplier came under suspicion. At the site of
production, hygiene problems were identified and the juice was not heat-
treated. None of the staff at the juice production company were IgM-positive,
but staff members often changed.
Discussion and conclusions
--------------------------
The case-control study and Egyptian investigation results strongly implicate
the juices served at the breakfast buffet as the vehicle of infection in this
outbreak. Although fruit juices are well-recognised vehicles of foodborne
diseases, citrus juices have only rarely been linked to hepatitis A outbreaks
[4]. The fact that the juice was consumed by 60 percent of the healthy
controls may be explained in part by fluctuating virus concentration within
the juice over a 4-week period, resulting in varying degrees of exposure. This
assumption is corroborated by the dose-response relationship regarding days of
consumption. Furthermore, we cannot exclude [the possibility] that some
controls might not have been aware of a previous HAV infection or may have
failed to mention previous HAV immunisation.
With 331 reported primary infections and several secondary infections in 9
European countries, the outbreak associated with stay in hotel X was
exceptionally large. A large proportion of German tourists in hotel X were not
immunised against hepatitis A, although it is explicitly recommended for
travellers to Egypt and other endemic areas by international as well as
national guidelines. Some of the infected travellers reported that physicians
whom they had consulted for pre-travel advice had considered hepatitis A
vaccination unnecessary for this type of travel and destination. This outbreak
again emphasises the importance for tourists to seek adequate pre-travel
advice, preferably in an institution specialised in travel medicine. Travel
agencies should incorporate comprehensive pre-travel advice, including
immunisations, into their catalogues or refer travellers to a competent
institution for individual advice.

[Hepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable disease which can be contracted world-
wide. Outbreaks of hepatitis A are associated most frequently with defects in
the supply of drinking water, sewage contamination of general water supplies,
and lapses of hygiene in food preparation. Travellers in particular should
take advantage of the current effective vaccines which in 2 doses can provide
adequate protection for up to 20 years. Factors contributing to the large size
of this outbreak were the contamination of fruit juices available daily at a
breakfast buffet which originated from a single faulty production unit, the
low frequency of vaccine up-take among hotel guests, and lack of awareness of
risk as a result in some cases of singularly inadequate travel advice. -
