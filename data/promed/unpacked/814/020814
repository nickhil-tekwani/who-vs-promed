Chikungunya outbreaks hit Tangerang
-----------------------------------
A 12-year-old girl [name deleted] should have been enjoying her
school holidays like her friends. But the girl had to stay in bed, as
she has not been able to move her swollen arms and legs in the past 4
days. "I also feel itchy on the swollen parts of my legs and arms,"
she said.
Her father [name deleted], 44, said that he also began to have
similar symptoms 2 days ago. "It's like having a fever. I feel cold
and have joint pain. I also feel dizzy and sleepy all the time," he
said.
The pair are among over 50 residents of Kampong Pintu Kapuk, Bojong
Renged subdistrict in Teluk Naga district, Tangerang, who have
contracted chikungunya [virus disease].
1st recognized in its epidemic form in East Africa in 1952, it has
continued to cause major epidemics in Africa, India and Southeast
Asia. Also known as epidemic polyarthritis and rash, or buggy creek
virus, the 1st case reported in Indonesia was in Samarinda, East
Kalimantan, in 1973, and the last was in 1983 in Yogyakarta.
After a hiatus of almost 20 years, chikungunya broke out again in
early 2001 in Muara Enim, South Sulawesi and Aceh, then, in October
of the same year, in Bogor, West Java. The epidemic struck Bekasi in
West Java, and Purworejo and Klaten in Central Java in 2002.
Having similar symptoms to dengue fever, chikungunya, however, is
characterized by a briefer episode of fever, persistent arthralgia in
some cases, and by the absence of deaths. Chikungunya is a
self-limiting febrile virus [disease] that is transmitted through the
bite of the _Aedes aegypti_ or _Aedes africanus_ mosquito.
The illness usually lasts for 3 to 10 days, with arthralgia remaining
a problem for weeks to several months after the initial phase.
Since there is currently no antiviral available, prevention of the
disease focuses on controlling mosquitoes and avoiding mosquito
bites. Patients should get enough rest and eat nutritious food.
The Tangerang regional health agency, with help from the Ministry of
Health, has sent a team of medical doctors to the small village near
the Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, which will be affected by
the expansion of the airport in the near future.
The team provided free medical treatment for villagers who are
suffering with chikungunya symptoms and took blood samples for
laboratory tests.
Head of the communicable disease prevention unit at the regional
health agency, Yuliah Iskandar, said that the agency would fumigate
the village and other villages in the whole district to curb the
epidemic.
"We advise residents to immediately get a check up at public health
centers if they begin to feel the symptoms. We also tell them to keep
their environment clean to prevent mosquitoes from breeding," she
said.

At least 98 residents of Bojong Renged village, Teluknaga subdistrict,
Tangerang have been infected with chikungunya [virus disease], a mosquito-borne
disease similar to dengue fever, an official said on Saturday [16 Jul 2005].
Yuliah Iskandar, head of the disease prevention unit at the Tangerang
Health Office, said her office had declared the outbreak an
extraordinary incident that required immediate attention. "We
declared this an extraordinary incident with the aim of stopping it
from spreading to neighboring areas," she said. Yuliah said the
decision was made because the number of people infected had more than
doubled in a week.
The disease initially hit residents in neighborhood unit RT 16 and
later spread to the adjacent RT 18 neighborhood unit, she said.
Officials from the health office have sprayed to kill the mosquitoes
spreading the disease, Yuliah said.
Chikungunya [virus disease], like dengue fever, is characterized by an
extremely high fever and severe joint pain.

[The original report spelled "chikungunya" with a capital C throughout.
However, the word is a descriptive, like dengue & yellow fever, so does not
require a capital. It means "doubled-up", referring to the severe joint pains.
