The emergence of a new strain of late potato blight with signs of resistance to the popular fungicide fluazinam is causing concern among agronomists who suggest switching to other products. Fluazinam has been one of the most effective actives against the disease, but frequent use may have increased the selection pressure on the fungicide.

After 5 cases of the 37_A2 (Dark Green 37) strain were confirmed in the UK last year [2016], largely in the English Midlands, it has spread to Kent, Shropshire, North Yorkshire, Cheshire and most recently Derbyshire. It has not been seen in East Anglia yet.

Darryl Shailes, Hutchinsons advisory group, said from only a handful of cases in 2016, there have been close to 20 confirmed cases this year [2017]. "We don't know where it will go next, but we do know it is at least as competitive as the dominant strains Blue 13 and Pink 6 [see comments below]," he said. Although little is known about this strain of the potato industry's most damaging disease, it has proved to be highly aggressive.

[Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus-like organism (oomycete) _Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 per cent crop loss. The pathogen can also affect tomato and some other solanaceous crops. In potato, it affects leaves as well as tubers; in tomato, it causes lesions and rotting of leaves, stems and fruits. The disease is favoured by cool, moist conditions. It can spread rapidly within a crop and destroy it within a few days. Under favourable conditions, epidemics in tomatoes may be even more rapid than in potatoes.

PLB is spread by plant material (including plant debris and volunteer crop plants), mechanical means (including human and insect activities), wind and water. Disease management requires an integrated approach and may include removal of pathogen reservoirs, crop rotation, preventive fungicide treatments of planting material and fungicide sprays of crops. Farm-saved or uncertified seed tubers have often been reported as sources of PLB outbreaks and seed tuber certification schemes have been set up in many countries. Clean planting stock and management strategies for fungicide resistance of the pathogen are vital. Development of resistant cultivars is being counteracted by the adaptability of the pathogen.

Late blight is considered an increasing problem worldwide. Considerable variation in aggressiveness between different pathogen strains has been observed, but more virulent strains are emerging frequently. Where both A1 and A2 mating types of the pathogen are present, reproduction occurs sexually as well as asexually, increasing the chances of strains with additional fungicide resistances and increased yield losses to develop. All blight outside Mexico was A1 until in 1976 when potatoes were imported into Europe from Mexico to satisfy shortages. Soon after A2 strains were detected in Europe.

It has been reported that regional differences in pathogen population diversity no longer exist in Europe, where strains like the particularly aggressive A2-Blue 13 (EU_13_A2; ProMED-mail posts 20090406.1332 and 20100212.0505) as well as A1-Pink 6 (ProMED-mail post 20100604.1851) are now dominating. Further strains, such as A2-Green 33 which also shows reduced sensitivity to fluazinam (ProMED-mail post 20120202.1031230), are emerging. A2-Dark Green 37 was first detected in the Netherlands in 2013 and is spreading in the region. It accounted for 5.5 per cent of the EU population sampled in 2016 (see link below).

Furthermore, the incidence of strains with mixed A1/A2 parentage which is used as an indicator of genetic recombination frequencies, has also started to increase in recent years (e.g. ProMED-mail post 20150317.3237610). This is particularly worrying and increases the threat of PLB to potato production for European countries and their trading partners.
