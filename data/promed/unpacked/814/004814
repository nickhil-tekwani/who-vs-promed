Racers head down the straightaway at Pimlico Race Course during the
2004 Preakness. Pimlico was set to lift an equine herpes quarantine
this week.
The outbreak of the equine herpes virus at Pimlico Race Course, home
of the Preakness Stakes, may now be spreading to other Maryland
thoroughbred facilities, even as a quarantine at Pimlico was
scheduled to be lifted this week.
The Maryland Department of Agriculture placed a "hold order" on Barn
One at the Bowie Training Center Wednesday after a horse showed
symptoms of the virus. This came one day after a euthanized Laurel
Park filly tested positive for equine herpesvirus.
Experts are uncertain whether the horses contracted equine herpes
through contact with other horses or had been carrying the virus
genetically, in which case the timing of the onset of symptoms would
have simply been a coincidence.
Despite these developments, Maryland racing officials are playing
down fears that the virus is spreading and insist that the 2nd leg of
racing's Triple Crown, the May 20 Preakness at Pimlico, will not be
threatened.
"You always can speculate, doomsday scenarios and all, but the way
it's been handled ... the response has been superb," said John P.
McDaniel, chairman of the Maryland Racing Commission. "I'm of the
opinion that this thing is going to pass on."
J. Michael Hopkins, executive director of the racing commission, said
these incidents have not changed plans for a 8 Feb 2006 lifting of
the quarantine at Pimlico, where most of the equine herpes cases have
occurred. The quarantine was put into place Jan. 21 as part of an
effort to keep the virus from spreading to other racing facilities.
Removal of the quarantine would allow horses stabled at Pimlico to
race at Laurel Park, which has been struggling to fill its racing
cards as a result of the quarantine and restrictions on the transport
of horses from state to state.
Two featured races of Laurel's winter season have already been
canceled due to a lack of horses and will have to be rescheduled: the
$300 000 Barbara Fritchie Breeder's Cup Handicap and the $300 000
General George Breeder's Cup Handicap.
The shortage has also forced Laurel to cancel racing on 2 Sundays, at
an estimated loss of about $2 million in betting handle each day,
according to Lou Raffetto, chief operating officer of the Maryland
Jockey Club, which runs both Laurel and Pimlico.
The Jockey Club is still considering whether to cancel racing on a
third Sunday. If horses stabled at Pimlico were to remain under
quarantine, the chances of cancellation would be much greater.
"This thing is having a big effect on the racing community at large,"
said Richard Hoffberger, president of the Maryland Thoroughbred
Horsemen's Association. "It's one step short of devastating."
5 horses have been euthanized as a result of the equine herpes outbreak.
Hopkins said officials do not yet know how equine herpes appeared at
Bowie or Laurel.
Maryland racing officials have been trying to prevent the spread of
equine herpes from horse to horse by isolating the infected animals,
who can transfer the virus to other horses by nuzzling, contact with
contaminated buckets or other items or through the air.
David Zipf, chief veterinarian for the Maryland Racing Commission,
said the virus is difficult to track because it can lie dormant for
so long.
"That's the really insidious thing about this -- (horses) can be
carriers and never show symptoms," Zipf said.
He estimates that 20 percent of horses are genetic carriers of the
equine herpes type 1 virus, which has wreaked havoc on Maryland's
racing industry.
In addition to complications stemming from the virus' long latency
periods, veterinarians are also hampered by frequent mutations in the
strain and the fact that horses respond to the onset of the virus in
different ways.
"You never know what form it's going to take," Zipf said. Most often,
the first symptom of equine herpes is fever. Horses may then
experience respiratory problems.
Depending on a number of factors, the virus sometimes progresses to
create neurological problems that cause a horse to wobble and flail,
lose coordination and eventually become paralyzed.
However, Zipf said, some healthy horses can recover from equine
herpes and even return to racing.
"It's an atypical virus and therefore we get atypical symptoms," he said.
