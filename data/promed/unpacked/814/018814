Four new cases of mad cow disease (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE)
have been discovered in Switzerland, according to Swiss Radio International
Wednesday.
The authorities said at least 2 of the cases involve cows born since the use
of animal 'flour' was banned in 1990. According to earlier reports, another
49 cases have been found up to 24 Dec 1999.
However, the Swiss Federal Veterinary Office was quoted as saying it is
still confident the goal of eradicating the disease by the year 2003 can be
achieved in spite of the marked increase last year.
"The long-term trend is quite clear. BSE in Switzerland is on the decline,"
said a specialist at the office, adding that the higher numbers last year
could be due to the new control program, more media coverage on the subject
and the possibility some cases were not reported in earlier years.
In 1990, Swiss authorities banned the use of animal fodder. This leads them
to believe cases of BSE in cows born in 1997 and after are now less
likely.
