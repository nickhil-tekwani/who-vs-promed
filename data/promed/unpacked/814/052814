Health officials said Friday [20 Mar 2009], 15 people have been
diagnosed with cutaneous anthrax in the southern Indian state of
Andhra Pradesh over the past week.

The outbreak has occurred in some half-dozen villages of the state's
Vishakhapatnam district, its medical and health officer, J Sarojini,
told CNN. Four of the patients have been hospitalized, with one in
critical condition, she said. Health officials are also looking into
the cause of one death, she added.

The disease has been blamed on [infected meat from] cows and goats
that Sarojini said died recently. However, veterinary experts
surveying the district have found no infection among livestock.

Health officials are administering antibiotics in the affected villages.

[Cattle outbreaks have been reported in Andhra Pradesh each year to
OIE since 2000; and in 2005 there were 39 outbreaks, with 20 cattle
cases and 135 sheep and goats affected; in 2006 there were 46
outbreaks, 8 cattle cases and 251 sheep and goats affected; and in
2007 there were 54 outbreaks, 35 cattle cases, 216 sheep and goats.

In general in India cases in small ruminants are extensively
under-reported. In 1999 there was one human pneumonic death, and 2
gastroenteric and 8 cutaneous cases reported in relation to "several
goats in hundreds died and buried," part of an ongoing problem since
1988. All of which makes one wonder why the AP state veterinary
service has not established a statewide control programme. Such is
long overdue.

That no evidence of livestock cases is forthcoming in the relevant
villages is just a function of the quality of the investigation and
of local mutual trust between the locals and state officials. The
trick is to have a junior officer drift away from the formal enquiry
and casually ask the kids what happened.
