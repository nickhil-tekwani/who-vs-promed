Cholera in Zimbabwe: epidemiological bulletin No. 1 -- 15 Dec 2008
------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the 1st epidemiological bulletin to be issued since the
August 2008 onset of a countrywide cholera epidemic in Zimbabwe.
Further bulletins are planned with a weekly frequency, coinciding
with the end of each epidemiological week (Sunday to Saturday). In
addition, daily short epidemiological updates are envisaged: these
will eventually integrate and supplement the current OCHA daily
cumulative caseload updates.

This epidemiological bulletin aims to provide an overview of the
epidemic throughout Zimbabwe, including province-by-province data, so
as to inform and improve the ongoing public health response. It also
provides guidance to agencies on issues relating to data collection,
analysis, and interpretation, and suggests operational strategies on
the basis of epidemiological patterns so far.

Readers will find that, for most provinces, the bulletin relies on
incomplete and somewhat outdated data, with the last date of
reporting being between 2 and 21 days before its date of publication.
The WHO Cholera Outbreak Response Team is working hard to improve
surveillance. The challenges are daunting, due to the countrywide
nature of the epidemic (56 districts affected; more than 100 cholera
treatment centres or units estimated to be operating); human resource
and material shortages at province and district level; communications
problems; and the fulminant nature of cholera outbreaks.

So as to improve surveillance, agencies directly engaged in case
management are strongly encouraged to share daily data with the
respective District Health Teams: this will ensure consistency and
reliability of data. While focus must be on strengthening Zimbabwe's
surveillance system, the WHO Cholera Outbreak Response Team greatly
welcomes feedback and data provided by individual agencies, and will
take these into account when producing further bulletins. Given the
scope of this epidemic, errors and omissions are almost inevitable:
we will be grateful for any information that helps to rectify these.

Overview of the epidemic
------------------------
A countrywide epidemic of cholera has been occurring in Zimbabwe
since August 2008. The epidemic currently affects 9 out of the 10
provinces in the country, and at least 57 (67.9 percent) out of a
total of 84 rural and urban districts (see the Annexes and Figure 1
[see full document URL below. - Mod.LL]) As of 15 Dec 2008, a total
of 18 413 suspected cases had been reported to the World Health
Organization (WHO), by way of the Ministry of Health and Child
Welfare (MoHCW)'s surveillance department. Table 3 [see below] in the
Annexes details the districts affected and the dates on which the 1st
cases were reported.

In all provinces affected, _Vibrio cholerae_ has been isolated from
suspected cases. Two serotypes have been found: Ogawa in Harare urban
and Beitbridge city, Matabeleland South; and both Ogawa and Inaba in
Chegutu and Makonde districts, Mashonaland West. Drug sensitivity
testing was carried out in some of the affected provinces, but to
date, results of these investigations have not been consolidated.
Tests on Mudzi samples are currently being carried out at the
National Reference Laboratory.

Timeline
--------
Cholera epidemics have been occurring every year in Zimbabwe since
1998. Between January and April 2008, a relatively small epidemic
occurred in 16 districts of Mashonaland East, Mashonaland Central,
Mashonaland West, Harare, and Manicaland, with less than 2000 cases
recorded in total.

Cholera resurfaced on 20 Aug 2008 in Chitungwiza city, just south of
Harare. There is no evidence that the 2 epidemics are independent: in
the present context of low access to health care, low-level
transmission could have gone on undetected.

During September 2008, cholera cases began to be reported in Makonde
and Chinhoyi urban districts (Mashonaland West). By the end of
October 2008, outbreaks were reported 2 more districts of the same
province (Kariba rural and urban districts); 2 districts of
Mashonaland East (Mudzi and Murehwa); and, critically, in Harare
city, where explosive outbreaks began, centered around Budiriro
suburb, in the southwest. As of the end of October 2008, however,
only 3 provinces and 8 districts were affected.

Between 1 and 15 Nov 2008, the epidemic swept through Zimbabwe,
affecting 6 more provinces and 46 more districts. After that time,
the expansion appears to have slowed down, with only 3 further
districts reporting outbreaks. However, this may partly be
attributable to inadequate surveillance.

[4] Cholera - Botswana (Central Province)
Date: Tue 16 Dec 2008
Source: The Daily News, Botswana Press Agency (BOPA) report [edited]
<http://www.mcst.gov.bw/dailynews/newsdetails.php?id=%2011829>


One confirmed and 3 suspected cases of cholera have been reported in
the Tutume Sub-district, making it the 3rd district in Botswana to be
affected by cholera. Confirmed cases have already been reported in
the North East and Serowe/Palapye areas.

According to the Senior Nursing Officer, Ms Tebogo Gabathusi, the
cases in the sub-district occurred at the small village of
Mafungo/Hubona near Mathangwane. She said all the cases, which were
recorded last week, were initially evaluated at Mathangwane clinic
and later referred to Nyangabgwe Referral Hospital for admission and treatment.

Health authorities have complained that Mafungo/Hubona has a large
influx of Zimbabwean illegal immigrants, and that lack of law
enforcement officers in the village significantly contributes to the situation.

Only 19 cases of cholera are currently under treatment in Lusaka
District, which recorded 176 patients in the last 2 months, the
Ministry of Health has said.

Speaking at a Press briefing in Lusaka yesterday [15 Dec 2008],
Health Deputy Minister Mwendoi Akakandelwa said cholera in Northern,
Luapula, and Southern provinces had been brought under control.

Mr Akakandelwa said some of the cholera treatment centres that were
set up in Northern and Luapula provinces had been closed while
Southern Province had no case of cholera as the 3 patients who were
receiving treatment in Mazabuka had recovered and were discharged.

"In Lusaka District, over the past 2 months we have seen 176 patients
and successfully treated 153. The 4 that we lost died because of
getting to our health facilities late, 3 in Kanyama and one in
Chawama," he said.

Mr Akakandelwa said Lusaka District had 19 patients under treatment
with 17 of the patients admitted to Kanyama Health Centre and the
other two admitted to Chipata Health Centre.
