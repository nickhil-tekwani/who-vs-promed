[As in the present outbreak, horses were the affected species during
the 2003 Morocco outbreak, which took place in September 2003, with 5
horses dying out of the 8 reportedly infected.

Clinical WNF cases in horses are characterized by anorexia,
depression and neurological signs, which may include ataxia, weakness
or paralysis of one or more limbs, teeth grinding, aimless wandering,
convulsions and/or circling. Tremors of the face and neck muscles are
very common. Some animals have cranial nerve deficits, particularly
weakness or paralysis of the face and tongue, which may lead to
difficulty in swallowing. Attitudinal changes including somnolence,
apprehension, hyperesthesia or periods of hyper-excitability are also
common. Some horses with severe depression and facial paralysis may
hang their heads; this can result in severe facial edema. Coma,
impaired vision and head pressing can be seen. Colic and urinary
dysfunction (from mild straining to stranguria) have also been
reported. Fever is present in some but not all cases. Fatal hepatitis
was seen in a donkey with neurological signs in France. Injuries,
pulmonary infections acquired during prolonged recumbency, and other
secondary effects can complicate the course of the disease. Some
animals die spontaneously, but many severely affected animals are
euthanized for humane reasons. Horses that recover usually begin to
show improvement within 7 days of the onset of clinical signs. Most
but not all horses return to full function; approximately 10-20
percent may have residual defects such as weakness in one or more
limbs, decreased exercise tolerance, muscle atrophy or behavioral
changes. For further details,
see <http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/west_nile_fever.pdf>.

It would be interesting to know if human cases have been recorded as
well. - Mod.AS]
