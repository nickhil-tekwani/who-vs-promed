Date: 10 Jul 2015, from 12 to 2 pm EDT

The One Health Commission is starting to provide webinar support for many of the One Health educational presentations that are happening around the world so they can be viewed, free and in real time, by wider audiences. One advantage of this is that they can also be recorded (when speakers give permission) and posted online to continue teaching beyond the event.

One such webinar that the Commission is supporting in this way is happening on 10 Jul 2015, titled: Understanding _Bartonella_: A One Health Perspective. Presenters are Ed Breitschwerdt, DVM and Robert Mozayeni, MD, who are incredibly successful One Health research partners (http://www.galaxydx.com/web/understanding-bartonella-a-one-health-perspective/).

_Bartonella_ infections are increasingly implicated in complex chronic disease syndromes, yet are extremely difficult to diagnose accurately. The purpose of this webinar is to raise awareness about _Bartonella_; its prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Medical, veterinary and public health professionals will benefit from attending this FREE webinar.

At the conclusion of the program, attendees will be able to:
- Describe the epidemiology of _Bartonella_;
- Identify populations most at risk for _Bartonella_ infection; and
- Explain the process for accurate and timely diagnosis of and treatment considerations for _Bartonella_

A preliminary agenda will be posted shortly (http://www.galaxydx.com/web/understanding-bartonella-a-one-health-perspective/). Registration is now open. There is no cost to attend the live webinar but advance registration is required. Register at https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/8986001036662550018.

Please share this information with individuals who may be interested in your own networks and on listservs (email, website, social media, etc). Feel free to add this information directly to your own website and hyperlink back to our FREE Webinar page (http://www.galaxydx.com/web/?p=1812).
