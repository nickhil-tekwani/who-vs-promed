On [Sun 20 Sep 2015], the Ministry of Health reported 2 cases of MERS-CoV infection bringing the total number of casualties for the current year to 13 cases -- including 6 clinically ill and 5 deaths [presumably this includes 2 asymptomatic infections as well]. According to the Director of Communicable Disease, Dr Mohammed Abdullat, in a statement issued by the Ministry this evening [20 Sep 2015], the 1st case is a 29-year-old healthcare worker, and the 2nd case has high blood pressure and diabetes. Both cases are currently under treatment.

[From the report above, it appears as though the nosocomial outbreak in Amman is most likely continuing, with the addition of a healthcare worker and another case with known chronic disease -- (although the geographic locations of these 2 newly confirmed cases are not specified in the above report). Hopefully more details will be available in the coming days.

[While the number of cases reported from Saudi Arabia has markedly dropped during the month of September 2015 (62 newly confirmed cases during the period 1-21 Sep 2015) compared with that in August 2015 (127 newly confirmed cases during the period 1-31 Aug 2015), there is continued transmission. In the past 3 days there have been 3 newly confirmed cases, one each from Jeddah, Riyadh, and Najran. The newly reported cases from Riyadh had a history of contact with other known case(s) in the 14 days preceding onset of illness -- most likely associated with nosocomial transmission. On the other hand, the cases reported from Najran and Jeddah appear to be sporadic cases -- without identifiable contact with other known cases, although there was a healthcare worker from Jeddah reported as a newly confirmed case on 12 Sep 2015.... Of note, the most recent reported case from Madinah (the province where the holy sites visited by pilgrims during the Hajj) was reported one week ago on 14 Sep 2015.

[3] Saudi Arabia, Hajj begins, preparations - WHO press release 21 Sep 2015

Months of health preparations in place as Hajj pilgrimage begins
----------------------------------------------------------------
As an estimated 2 million Muslims from 184 countries gather in Saudi Arabia's holy city of Mecca to take part in the annual Hajj pilgrimage, months of preparations to care for health issues of pilgrims are also coming together.

Over the last 6 months, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Government of Saudi Arabia have been working together to ensure the health issues that could arise with any mass gathering of people can be addressed.

"With this large number of older people coming together at one time, an increase in potential health issues is always expected," says Dr Ala Alwan, WHO's Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean Region. "Whether it is working to prevent the spread of the infectious diseases, treating injuries, or providing care for chronic health issues often associated with ageing, there must be extensive coordination of health services locally during this time."

The Ministry of Health says in addition to the permanent medical staff in Makkah province, where Mina and Mecca are located, 25 000 additional health workers have been deployed and 8 hospitals that are only used during this time of the year have been opened.
"These hospitals are complete with state-of-the-art surgical wards and intensive care units," says H.E. Khalid Al-Falih, the Minister of Health of Saudi Arabia. "We recognize the concerns that many have regarding infectious disease in today's environment, including the Middle East respiratory disease coronavirus (MERS-CoV), however, since the onset of the disease in 2012, there have not been any cases among Hajj pilgrims, and we are working to keep it that way."

In addition to increases in health workers and health facilities where people will be gathering, the Government requires certain health precautions from all pilgrims including immunization to protect against diseases like seasonal influenza, meningococcal meningitis, poliomyelitis, and yellow fever. In addition, health officials advise people to practise good hygiene, including:
- washing hands with soap and water or disinfectant, especially after coughing or sneezing
- using disposable tissues when coughing or sneezing and disposing of them properly
- avoiding hand contact with the eyes, nose and mouth since those can be easy ways to spread germs.

This is the 6th year that WHO has been supporting the Government in health preparations for the Hajj.

[The Saudi Arabian MOH has years of expertise in the health management of mass gatherings. Given the ongoing transmission of MERS-CoV in the country, one suspects that at the moment there is a collective breath holding both within Saudi Arabia as well as internationally, hoping that this year's (2015) Hajj pilgrimage will follow that of the preceding 3 years' with respect to MERS-CoV. - Mod.MPP]
