[In response to the moderator's comments on the previous posting: Could WNV
have decreased resistance in horses that ordinarily would have had a
subclinical case of Corynebacterium (Pigeon Fever)? - Mod.TG]

I believe that there is no evidence that West Nile flavivirus impairs the
immune system, predisposing to other infectious processes. West Nile virus
localization in horses does not support this hypothesis. I do not recall
other equine viral encephalitides being able to predispose to secondary
infections with a direct or indirect viral effect on the immune system.

[No disrespect is intended to Dr. Del Piero. However, the cases cited above
occurred early in 2001 or late in 2000. This virus has spread far more
rapidly and is more virulent in 2002 than anyone predicted. We do recognize
that the scope of infected hosts from the WNV in circulation is much wider
than other flaviviruses (and apparently other strains of WNV).

We know this virus is far more widespread than any of the other equine
encephalitides as well. This virus has not followed the pattern of the WNV
in Europe and other parts of the world. I'm not sure I'd categorically rule
out some change in the underlying immune system. I would suggest there is
not adequate information about this virus yet to be taking hard stances
either way. - Mods.MPP/TG]
