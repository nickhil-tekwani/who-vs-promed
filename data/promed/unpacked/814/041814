Leishmaniasis epidemic hits Afghanistan
---------------------------------------
Leishmaniasis is sweeping through Afghanistan, infecting some 270 000
people whose resulting facial sores often make them social outcasts, the
World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday.The United Nations agency
appealed for $1.2 million to buy drugs and insecticide-treated bednets to
combat what it called the largest single outbreak of leishmaniasis. "This
is one case where a remarkably small amount of money could make an enormous
difference," WHO said in launching the 2-year emergency programme. "But we
need to act now."
Philippe Desjeux, in charge of leishmaniasis control for WHO, said that at
least 300 000 Afghan refugees returning to Kabul as well as international
aid workers were also at risk as they lacked immunity."There is a huge
epidemic in Afghanistan... It is not a fatal disease but highly disfiguring
with a strong stigma and exclusion of the family," Desjeux told a news
briefing. "If we can be very massive in our intervention, on a large scale
in Kabul, we can change the situation," he added. At least 200 000 people
are believed to be infected in Kabul, along with an estimated 70 000 people
in three other major Afghan cities -- Herat, Kandahar, and Mazar-i-Sharif
-- Desjeux said.
