Puppy epilepsy, dog food suspected
----------------------------------
Veterinarians connected to Ghent University sounded the alarm because
young puppies had seizures after eating certain types of dog food.

This relates to chunks of Bento Kronen, "Lamb & Rice All Breeds
Growth 8." It is not yet proven whether the seizures are directly
related to the consumption of the kibble, but according to
veterinarian Sofie Bhati, head neurology clinic at the University of
Ghent, all affected puppies ate the pellets.

The producer, Versele-Laga, has already been informed. The Federal
Agency for the Safety of Food calls the case "weird". "We are awaiting
the results of the investigation, but assume that possibly a supplier
changed the composition [of raw material/ingredient? - Mod.AS] without
our knowledge. As a precaution we have decided to recall the products
distributed during the recent 8 months", said marketing manager Ann
Breugelmans.

[We are informed that similar recall steps have been undertaken in
Israel. The local importer/distributor of "Lamb & Rice All Breeds
Growth 8," produced in Belgium by Versele-Laga, has been required by
Israel's Veterinary Services on 19 May 2011 to collect the product
from the shops and from private clients. No cases in puppies have been
recorded in Israel. - Mod.AS]
