Measles claims 22 lives in Zimbabwe
-----------------------------------
A total of 22 people, mainly children below the age of 5, have died
of measles in Zimbabwe, the country's state media reported.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said 2 weeks ago it was "deeply
frustrated" by the measles outbreak, which came after it sponsored a
vaccination program in the African nation. WHO's head in Zimbabwe,
Dr. Custodia Mandlhate, told journalists in Harare the outbreak has
totaled more than 340 suspected cases this year [2009], and "this is
not acceptable." She said the outbreak came about "mainly because of
people who have denied their children vaccination."

The Herald on Tuesday [29 Dec 2009] reported the 22 victims had not
been vaccinated, quoting health officials in the troubled country. 90
cases have been confirmed nationwide, Zimbabwe's Health and Child
Welfare Minister Henry Madzorera told the newspaper. "This is an
unwarranted loss of lives given the fact that measles is a
preventable disease," he said, according to the state-owned Herald
[newspaper]. "In Zimbabwe, outbreaks of measles were rare because of
sustained high vaccination coverage among all children. It is
therefore important for parents to realize that vaccinating their
children protects the individual children" from the disease and its
complications," he said.

The outbreak has hit 5 districts in Zimbabwe, Madzorera said. It is
likely to further strain Zimbabwe's health system.

[In the previous report of this measles outbreak in Zimbabwe, dated
19 Dec 2009, it was revealed that 340 suspected cases of measles had
been diagnosed widely dispersed through the districts of Bubi,
Murambinda, Makoni, Chipinge, Chirumanzu, Zvishavane and Marondera.
(A map showing the administrative regions of Zimbabwe can be accessed

It is now reported that 90 of the 340 suspected cases of measles have
been confirmed and that there have been been 22 fatalities, mostly
unvaccinated children under 5 years of age. These figures reveal that
there has been a very serious breakdown in measles vaccination
coverage in Zimbabwe, and the outbreak is country-wide. This is
perhaps not surprising in view of Zimbabwe's fraught economy, and it
is likely that further WHO intervention will be necessary.
