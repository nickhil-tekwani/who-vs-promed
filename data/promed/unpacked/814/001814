An outbreak of red algae sweeping a section of the State's Parramatta River
has sparked an official warning for residents to avoid contact with the
water. The New South Wales Environment Protection Authority (EPA) last
night advised of the algae outbreak in the Putney-Tennyson area. EPA
Director-General, Neil Shepherd, said several residents had called the
authority's pollution hotline this morning with reports of dead fish on the
foreshores of Morrisons Bay and Glades Bay.
Dr Shepherd said preliminary tests on fish and water samples had indicated
the presence of a species of red algae related to _Chatonella_. Samples of
the algae had been sent to a specialist laboratory in Tasmania to identify
the exact species. Dr Shepherd said these species of red algae were toxic
to fish and could cause skin irritations in some people.
"Red tides are likely to be most evident in bays and inlets sheltered from
the mixing effects of winds and tides," he said in a statement, adding that
people should avoid contact with any discoloured water in these areas.
Last year, _Chatonella_ appeared sporadically in the Parramatta River and
Sydney Harbour.
