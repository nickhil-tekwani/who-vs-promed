The zebra chip pathogen has been found for the 1st time in Western Canada. University of Lethbridge's Dan Johnson [said that] so far, _Candidatus_ Liberibacter solanacearum (Lso), the zebra chip pathogen, has been detected in small numbers of potato psyllids -- the pathogen's insect vector. But the pathogen has not yet been found in any potato plant tissue. "There's no infection of potatoes, which is good news. But it's likely to turn up," he says. Insects captured in separate sites have tested positive for the pathogen, which may mean there's a "widespread incidence of Lso at a very low level."

The discovery of the zebra chip pathogen is a game-changer for the industry. A new 5 year program is being planned, "a very active surveillance monitoring system to help potato growers make quick and timely decisions." Its initial focus will be on tracking potato psyllid numbers, as well as numbers of the insect's natural predators. If producers suspect they've captured potato psyllids they should contact provincial potato associations or agriculture departments and get the insects tested for Lso.

[Zebra chip (ZC) disease of potato has caused yield losses of up to 60 per cent in parts of the Americas. Symptoms include leaf yellowing, early senescence and death of above ground plant parts, as well as necrotic flecking of tubers where starch is converted to soluble sugars. This results in zebra-like stripes and brittleness during processing. ZC leaf symptoms also resemble a group of symptoms previously known as psyllid yellows. _Ca._ Liberibacter solanacearum (Lso) was found to be associated with ZC of potato and has also been associated with yellowing diseases of other solanaceous crops and some crops in the family Apiaceae. Main vectors of Lso are the potato psyllid (_Bactericera cockerelli_) in solanaceous host and carrot psyllids (_Trioza apicalis_, _B. trigonica_) in Apiaceae.

The Lso species is divided into haplotypes: A and B affecting Solanaceae; C, D, and E affecting Apiaceae. Both groups of haplotypes have been reported from the Americas and New Zealand. Carrot haplotypes only have been reported from several European countries, northern Africa and the Middle East (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives). Haplotype E was recently also detected in potatoes in Spain [ProMED-mail post 20170802.5222241], representing the 1st report of a haplotype being able to affect both Apiaceae and Solanaceae, but it is unclear whether typical zebra chip symptoms were observed in potatoes infected with haplotype E. More research is needed on epidemiology, biology and distribution of Lso worldwide.

Additional association of phytoplasmas with liberibacter diseases, including Lso and the pathogens causing citrus greening (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives) has been reported (see links below). The role of each of the pathogens in symptom development and epidemiology remains to be clarified.

The report above seems to be the first detection of Lso in Canada, but it is not clear if the haplotype has been determined, or if the perceived threat from ZC is based on the assumption that if the pathogen was detected in the potato psyllid, it must be a potato haplotype. Information on the haplotype(s) present in the country would be important for risk assessment.
