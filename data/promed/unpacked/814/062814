The number of people infected with dengue in a single week in Singapore has
risen to the year's [2007] highest level, stoking fears of an epidemic, a
newspaper said on Wednesday [30 May 2007]. A total of 259 dengue cases were
reported last week, the Strait Times said, the highest number of cases this
year, and breaching the "warning level" of 256 to 378 cases set by the
Health Ministry.
Epidemic levels are reached when more than 378 cases are reported in a
week, the paper said, adding health officials were worried that an epidemic
may be on its way in the city-state. A dengue epidemic hit Singapore in
2005, when 714 cases were reported in a single week, the Straits Times said.

From January to 3 Jun this year [2007], Bukidnon registered 212 dengue
cases, which is 152 per cent higher than the figure recorded in the same
period last year, data from the Regional Epidemic Surveillance Unit (Resu)
showed.
Slight increases of dengue cases were also observed in Misamis Oriental,
Lanao del Norte, and Camiguin provinces, but these were negligible compared
to the phenomenal rise in Bukidnon, which has already reached the alert
threshold, said Dr. David Mendoza of the Resu.
An outbreak is possible in areas that have reached the dengue alert
threshold, which is reached when cases are steadily growing for 5 years,
said Mendoza.
Of the 16 deaths, 6 were recorded in Misamis Oriental and Cagayan de Oro, 5
in Misamis Occidental, while the rest is spread among Bukidnon, Camiguin
and Lanao del Norte provinces. Meanwhile, dengue cases this year have
already reached 1076 as of Sunday [3 Jun 2007], slightly lower than the
1415 cases recorded in 2006. However, Mendoza said the Resu, an agency of
the Department of Health (DOH)-Northern Mindanao, was expecting the figure
to double when the year ends.
"The rainy season has started, so we expect the breeding sites of
mosquitoes to multiply. The DOH and the community must start cooperating
[with] each other to prevent more dengue-related deaths," he said.
He reiterated the DOH's 4S strategy to prevent a dengue outbreak: "Search
and destroy mosquito breeding sites, seek treatment in case of high fever,
self-protection through the use of mosquito repellent and other
contraptions, and say no to indiscriminate [insecticide] fogging."

Viet Nam's southern region experienced 10 551 dengue fever patients in the
1st 5 months of this year [2007], a year-on-year rise of 30 per cent,
according to the Ho Chi Minh City Pasteur Institute on Wednesday [30 May
2007]. Of the patients, 10 have died of dengue fever. Weather conditions in
the region and local people's habit of storing water in containers at their
houses favor the breeding of mosquitoes, the virus's transmitter.
Local health care agencies are asking residents to frequently clean up the
environment around their accommodations, mainly by keeping water containers
closed and clean and killing mosquitoes and their larvae, the institute said.
In 2006, Viet Nam faced over 77 800 cases of dengue fever infections,
including 68 fatalities. Up to 84 per cent of the infections and 91 per
cent of the deaths were reported in the southern region.
