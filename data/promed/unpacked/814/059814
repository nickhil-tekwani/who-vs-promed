53 cholera deaths have been recorded in Zimbabwe in the past day [24
Nov 2008], bringing the total from the outbreak to 366 since August
2008, the UN has said. The UN Office for the Co-ordination of
Humanitarian Affairs said reported cases had reached 8887, up by 1604.
Most of the deaths were reported in Beitbridge, near South Africa's
border.

Earlier, the UN secretary-general told Zimbabwe's politicians the
humanitarian situation meant they could not afford to fail to agree a
power-sharing deal. Ban Ki-moon said President Robert Mugabe's
Zanu-PF party and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change
(MDC), meeting in South Africa, should reach a workable agreement
quickly, so they can "tackle the formidable challenges ahead."

Mr Ban added that he was also concerned by the "collapse of health,
sanitation and education services, and the consequent rapidly
escalating cholera outbreak."
