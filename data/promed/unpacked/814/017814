Subject: Missing TB-infected bull

Advisory from the Texas Animal Health Commission
-------------------------------------------------
The Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC), is working to find all animals
that were commingled with the infected herd. To date, the TAHC staff has
been unable to find one TB-exposed Charolais bull from the herd.
PLEASE help us! If you know the whereabouts of this animal, please call Dr.
Thurman Fancher in the TAHC Area 6 office in Lampasas at 1-800-658-6642.
The TAHC and USDA will negotiate to purchase this animal for diagnostic
evaluation.
The Charolais bull was last seen at the Dublin Livestock Market on 18 May
2001. The Texas eartag number is 74-ENE9321. The animal has a pitchfork
brand and the number "500" on the left hip.
Please call if you know where this animal is located! Texas has a TB-free
status for cattle, and if not found, this animal could jeopardize this
status and our ability to ship cattle out of state freely!
