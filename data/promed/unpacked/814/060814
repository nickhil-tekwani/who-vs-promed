When Anton Kudryavsev became head of the infectious diseases department at
a small clinic in the Tula region less than a year ago, he hardly imagined
he would find himself fighting an outbreak of a potentially fatal disease
long considered eradicated [sic. But now, with 12 patients recovering
from typhoid and 7 other patients suspected of having contracted the
disease locked in quarantine, 24-year-old Kudryavsevs hands are full
grappling with an illness not reported in the region for nearly half a
century.
The news of the outbreak (2 of the patients who fell ill in September and
were diagnosed only in October were 9-year-old children) sent a wave of
panic through the town of 25 000 located some 150 kilometers south of
Moscow. Local authorities promptly closed the town market, dairy and
schools for a week, hoping to stave off the [bacterial disease, which is
typically spread by contaminated food and water.
Typhoid symptoms include a prolonged high fever, weakness, abdominal pains
and sometimes a rash and diarrhea. Without proper antibiotic treatment, the
disease can sometimes prove fatal. "With all those newspaper articles and
television reports people have been afraid to go outside," Kudryavsev said,
adding that the situation now looks to be "under control."
The market reopened Friday, and as of Monday only the local dairy remained
closed. Epidemic experts at the local health inspectorate are still trying
to pinpoint the source of the deadly disease. Some have pointed to vendors
from Chechnya, where several typhoid outbreaks have been registered this
year. Others say the citys rusty sewage and water-supply systems (nearly
half the town has running water only 6 hours a day) is to blame. Last
year nearly 70 locals got sick when Yasnogorsk was struck with an outbreak
of dysentery. "The water is filthy here. I wouldn't be surprised if they
find something even more exotic in it," said Nikolai, 39, a driver. But
Valentina Romanova, head of the inspectorate, said the sewage and water
systems were most likely not to blame, arguing that otherwise the number of
typhoid cases would have been much higher.
Kudryavsev said that during the Soviet era, disease control was much
stricter and more efficient. For example, travelers from countries like
Turkey and Bulgaria, which both had a higher incidence of typhoid, were
quarantined for 7 days to avoid spreading the disease.
