Nigeria has reported more outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in its Kano and Delta regions.

1 outbreak of the H5N1 strain on a farm in the Delta region caused 7973 deaths in a flock comprising broilers, layers and breeders at different ages of production.

Over 330 000 poultry were destroyed as a result of the outbreak.

In the Kano region, H5N1 outbreaks on 3 different farms caused the death of 376 birds, and another 15 000 had to be destroyed to prevent the disease spreading.
