WHO is working closely with the USA's CDC and other international
partners following the issue of health advisories in connection with
an air passenger from the USA who traveled to Europe while affected
by XDR-TB. CDC is carrying out investigations in line with those
recommended in the WHO Tuberculosis and Air Travel Guidelines. The
guidelines include measures that should be considered by relevant
authorities to limit the risks of transmission of infectious TB.

A man with a form of tuberculosis so dangerous he is under the 1st
USA government-ordered quarantine since 1963 had health officials
around the world scrambling Wed 30 May 2007 to find about 80
passengers who sat within 5 rows of him on 2 trans-Atlantic flights.
CDC Director Julie Gerberding said Wed 30 May 2007 that the CDC is
working closely with airlines to find passengers who may have been
exposed to the rare, dangerous strain. Health officials in France
said they have asked Air France-KLM for passenger lists, and the
Italian Health Ministry said it is tracing the man's movements.
"Is the patient himself highly infectious? Fortunately, in this case,
he's probably not," Gerberding said. "But the other piece is this
bacteria is a very deadly bacteria. We just have to err on the side
of caution."
Dr. Martin Cetron, director of the CDC's division of global migration
and quarantine, said on Wed 30 May 2007 that the agency was trying to
contact 27 crew members from the 2 flights for testing and about 80
passengers who sat in the 5 rows surrounding the man. About 40 or 50
of those people sat in or near Row 51 on the Air France flight from
Atlanta to Paris, and about 30 passengers were in or near seat 12C on
the 2nd flight, from Prague to Montreal.
Health officials said the man had been advised not to fly and knew he
could expose others when he boarded the jets.
The man, however, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that doctors
didn't order him not to fly and only suggested he put off his
long-planned wedding in Greece. He knew he had a form of tuberculosis
and that it was resistant to first line drugs, but he didn't realize
until he was already in Europe that it could be so dangerous, he said.
"We headed off to Greece thinking everything's fine," said the man,
who declined to be identified because of the stigma attached to his diagnosis.
He flew to Paris on 12 May 2007 aboard Air France Flight 385, also
listed as Delta Air Lines codeshare Flight 8517. While he was in
Europe, health authorities reached him with the news that further
tests had revealed his TB was a rare, "extensively drug-resistant"
form, far more dangerous than he knew. They ordered him into
isolation, saying he should turn himself over to Italian officials.
Instead, the man flew from Prague to Montreal on 24 May 2007 aboard
Czech Air Flight 0104 then drove back into the USA at Champlain, NY.
He told the newspaper he was afraid that if he didn't get back to the
USA, he wouldn't get the treatment he needed to survive. He is now at
Atlanta's Grady Memorial Hospital in respiratory isolation.
A spokesman for Denver's National Jewish Hospital, which specializes
in respiratory disorders, said Wed 30 May 2007 that the man would be
treated there. It was not clear when he would arrive, spokesman
William Allstetter said.
"The patient continues to feel well and be asymptomatic. He's
currently still in isolation," Cetron said. Citing privacy concerns,
he said the CDC "cannot and won't talk further about this patient."
The other passengers on the flights are not considered at high risk
of infection because tests indicated the amount of TB bacteria in the
man was low, Cetron said.
But Gerberding noted that American health officials have had little
experience with this type of TB. It's possible it may have different
transmission patterns, she said. "We're thankful the patient was not
in a highly infectious state, but we know the risk of transmission
isn't zero, even with the fact that he didn't have symptoms and
didn't appear to be coughing," Gerberding said on ABC's "Good Morning America."
"We've got to really look at the people closest to him [and] get them
skin tested."
Dr. Howard Njoo of the Public Health Agency of Canada said it
appeared unlikely that the man spread the disease on the flight into
Canada. Still, the agency was working with USA officials to contact
passengers who sat near him.
Daniela Hupakova, a spokeswoman for the Czech airline CSA, said the
flight crew underwent medical checks and are fine. The airline was
contacting passengers and cooperating with Czech and foreign
authorities, she said. Health officials in France have asked Air
France-KLM to provide lists of passengers seated within 2 rows of the
man, an airline spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity according
to company policy.
The man told the Journal-Constitution he was in Rome during his
honeymoon when the CDC notified him of the new tests and told him to
turn himself in to Italian authorities to be isolated and be treated.
The CDC told him he couldn't fly aboard commercial airliners.
He told the newspaper he and his wife decided to sneak back into the
USA through Canada. He said he voluntarily went to a New York
hospital then was flown by the CDC to Atlanta. He is not facing
prosecution, health officials said.
"I'm a very well-educated, successful, intelligent person," he told
the paper. "This is insane to me that I have an armed guard outside
my door when I've cooperated with everything other than the whole
solitary-confinement-in-Italy thing."
Health officials said the man's wife tested negative for TB before
the trip and is not considered a public health risk. They said they
don't know how the Georgia man was infected.
The quarantine order was the 1st since the government quarantined a
patient with smallpox in 1963, according to the CDC.
Because of antimicrobial agents and other measures, the TB rate in
the USA has been falling for years. In 2006, it affected an all-time
low of 13 767 cases, or about 4.6 cases per 100 000 Americans.
Health officials worry about "multidrug-resistant" TB, which can
withstand the first line agents isoniazid and rifampin. The man was
infected with something even worse, "extensively drug-resistant" TB,
also called XDR TB, which resists many drugs used to treat the
infection. There have been 17 XDR TB cases in the USA since 2000,
according to CDC statistics.

[It appears that the information relating the sensitivity pattern of
the individual's _M. tuberculosis_ isolate was not known until after
his trip to Europe. The posting describes that "the patient was not
in a highly infectious state, but we know the risk of transmission
isn't zero, even with the fact that he didn't have symptoms and
didn't appear to be coughing." This description suggests that the man
was microscopically "smear-negative" for acid-fast bacilli (a group
with substantially lower infectivity) and the absence of cough
further underscores the low risk of transmission.
No details, in addition, are yet available regarding diagnostic
procedures used to confirm tuberculosis here (spontaneously
coughed-up sputum, sputum obtained by induction using humid air or
bronchoscopy); whether there is any history of past tuberculosis
treatment in this man; and how extensive his radiographic changes were.
Up to this point, there is no information to suggest that XDR TB is
more infectious than its more sensitive cousin related to
person-to-person spread.
More background regarding TB transmission on airplanes and other
transport vehicles will be forthcoming. - Mod.LL]
