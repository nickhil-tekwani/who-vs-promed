New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks (1)
Outbreak location: Runnymede, Surrey, England
Started: 29 Oct 2021
Ended: 5 Nov 2021
Epidemiological unit: not applicable
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Dog / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: a pet dog (the only pet present) from a COVID-19 positive household was presented with sudden onset pyrexia, lethargy, inappetence, and increased respiratory rate to a veterinary hospital at which it had surgery (thoracotomy to remove a thymoma) within the previous weeks. The dog had been recovering uneventfully. Both owners of the dog had developed COVID-19 symptoms over the preceding 2-3 days before the dog developed these clinical signs. The dog was examined by the attending veterinarian, and whilst mild respiratory signs were observed these cannot be exclusively attributed to SARS-CoV-2. The dog has responded to symptomatic treatment. Swab samples were collected from the dog on [29 Oct 2021]: pharyngeal swab (in media), rectal swab, rectum swab, and a conjunctival swab. All were submitted to APHA Weybridge for SARS-CoV-2 testing. RNA from the pharyngeal swab tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (E and RdRp genes), but all other swab samples were negative.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: direct contact with COVID-19 positive owners (confirmed by official public health PCR testing).
Epidemiological comments: there are no other pets in the household. The case is considered resolved. Conclusions: there is sufficient evidence that the dog was infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate if the dog was clinically affected by the virus. Origin of the infection is considered likely to be direct contact with persons diagnosed with COVID-19 in the same household. Nota bene: the outbreak location used is that of the National Reference Laboratory, APHA Weybridge for data protection reasons.

Diagnostic test results
