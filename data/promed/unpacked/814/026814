Japanese encephalitis (JE), an infection of the brain caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), has claimed its 1st victim in the district this year [2018]. This is also the 1st ever death due to JE in the district.

The victim is a man, 55, a resident of Puttur. He was admitted for fever on 4 Dec [2017] in Puttur and later was shifted to a hospital in Mangaluru as the fever did not subside. He went back home a few days in January [2018], and the infection recurred. He died at a hospital in Puttur on Monday [8 Jan 2018].

Dr BV Rajesh, District Surveillance Officer, confirmed that the patient died due to JEV, saying the test results came back positive for the virus infection from Manipal Centre for Virus Research (MCVR), Manipal.

Dr Arun Kumar, District Malaria Officer said though there have been JV infections, this is the 1st JE death in the district. While there were 3 JV infections reported in 2015, 2 were reported in 2017 in the district in December month [2017], and one of them died. Another case was reported in Pudu PHC of Bantwal taluk. The year 2016 had no JV cases reported.

According to the World Health Organization website, the infection is caused by JEV, a flavivirus related to dengue, yellow fever and West Nile viruses, and is spread by _Culex_ mosquitoes. JEV is the main cause of viral encephalitis in many countries of Asia with an estimated 68 000 clinical cases every year. There is no cure for the disease. The treatment is focused on relieving severe clinical signs and supporting the patient to overcome the infection. WHO has recommended integrating JV vaccine into national immunization schedules in all areas where JE disease is recognized as public health issue.

In the neighbouring district of Udupi, after 4 JE cases were reported, health officials were mulling on making the vaccine compulsory. In 2017, Udupi reported 3 cases of JV and one this year [2018].

WHO states most JEV infections are mild (fever and headache) or without apparent symptoms, but approximately one in 250 infections results in severe clinical illness. Severe disease is characterized by rapid onset of high fever, headache, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis and ultimately death. The case-fatality rate can be as high as 30 percent among those with disease symptoms. Of those who survive, 20-30 percent suffer permanent intellectual, behavioural or neurological problems such as paralysis, recurrent seizures or the inability to speak.

JEV is transmitted to humans through bites from infected mosquitoes of the _Culex_ species (mainly _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_). Humans, once infected, do not develop sufficient viraemia to infect feeding mosquitoes. The virus exists in a transmission cycle between mosquitoes, pigs and/or water birds (enzootic cycle).

[A few, sporadic cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) have been reported in Karnataka state over the years. Cases are much more frequent in northeastern states in India, such as Uttar Pradesh, discussed below. Vaccination is the most effective preventive measure. Control of vector mosquitoes is logistically difficult and expensive.

The number of cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) and Japanese encephalitis (JE) in UP was the highest for 2017 over the past decade. Data from the health department has revealed that from 2008 to 2017, the maximum number of AES and JE cases came in the past year. Both diseases manifest in the form of brain fever.

The highest number of JE deaths in UP was also recorded in 2017. In August 2017, around 30 children affected by JE admitted at Gorakhpur's BRD Medical College had died over shortage of oxygen supply.

According to the health department's own analysis, AES is a disease of significant magnitude in the state. Though 38 districts are endemic for AES, the predominant disease and mortality burden is carried by 7 districts of eastern UP, in Gorakhpur and Basti divisions.

In 2017, there were 4759 AES cases with 595 deaths. JE cases in 2017 were 677 with 81 deaths. This came after the health department claimed it had carried out a mass immunization campaign in 38 AES-JE endemic districts in May and June [2017], covering over 9.1 million children in the age group of 1-15 years.

AES cases between 2006 and 2007 were recorded at 2075 and 2675, with deaths at 476 and 577, respectively. JE cases in 2006 and 2007 were 170 and 235, with 49 and 29 deaths, respectively.

On the spike in cases and deaths, director for communicable diseases and the vector borne diseases unit of the health department Dr Mithilesh Chaturvedi said: "The number of cases has increased, but the case fatality rate (CFR) has gone down in the past 10 years. This means that cases are being reported, but fatality has decreased."

She added: "The CFR [case fatality rate] in 2017 for AES cases was 12.5 percent and that for JE was 11.9 percent. This in 2016 was 16.3 percent for AES and 16.7 percent for JE." Officials also reasoned that it was because of the awareness created around brain fever by ASHA workers on the ground that cases had increased. More people were aware that the fever affecting their child was AES or JE.

[The report does not state whether the vaccine being administered is a killed (inactivated) one with limited duration of immunity or a live, attenuated one that would provide much longer protection. It is interesting that the above report clearly differentiates acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) from JE cases. In previous reports, this differentiation often has not been made. The etiological agent or conditions responsible for AES are not mentioned above. Previous reports indicate that JE is a minor cause of encephalitis in Uttar Pradesh state. The determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), and lychee fruit consumption. Recently, scrub typhus has been implicated in many AES cases but is very unlikely for infants. - Mod.TY
