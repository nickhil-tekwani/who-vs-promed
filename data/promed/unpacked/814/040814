New Zealand on high alert after sudden deaths
----------------------
Health authorities tonight were on high alert in New Zealand following the
sudden deaths of 3 people suffering pneumonia-like symptoms in the southern
city of Dunedin.
Otago Medical Officer of Health John Holmes said in a statement the 3 cases
were all individuals in their 40s and 50s who would not normally be
expected to die suddenly.
All 3 patients came from a small geographical area in Dunedin and suddenly
fell ill, dying within hours, Holmes said.
Preliminary indications for all three cases suggested pneumonia, he said.
Health authorities around the world have been on heightened alert since the
global outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a form of
atypical pneumonia, which killed more than 800 people earlier this year.

Some time before mystery deaths explained say health officials
------------------------------
Health authorities tonight warned it could be some time before the cause of
3 recent unexplained deaths in Dunedin is known.
The three deaths were revealed by health officials today, with a media
conference called tonight to put to rest speculation about the deaths.
The 3 dead people were all in their 40s and 50s with no obvious risk
factors who would not normally be expected to die suddenly, Otago Medical
Officer of Health Dr John Holmes said today.
The 3 died from pulmonary haemorrhage, but the cause of the bleeding into
their lungs was yet to be determined, Dr Holmes told the media briefing.
He and other health authorities warned that a wide variety of potential
causes of death were being investigated, and "it could be quite some time"
before the cause of the deaths was known.
"We're doing all we can to find the cause."
While the 3 people lived close by in Dunedin, they seemed to have no other
connection.
The officials said the deaths were not caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS), which this year killed hundreds of people worldwide.
Director General of Health Dr Karen Poutasi said hospitals nationwide were
being notified of the mystery deaths, and were being asked to investigate
any recent unexplained deaths.
Dr Poutasi said the Health Ministry was putting surveillance measures into
place throughout the country.
She said one unexplained death could occur at any time, 2 in close
proximity was unusual, and 3 was even more unusual.
"This is still a very low number of cases, but the ministry wants to know
whether there are any more cases elsewhere in the country, and we have
asked all district health boards to be on alert, and the boards have asked
their general practitioners to be on alert. We will be monitoring the
situation very very closely."
Dr Holmes said all 3 patients came from a small geographical area in
Dunedin. All were previously well, but suddenly fell ill and died within hours.
All the cases, of 2 women and one man, had been reported to the coroner,
but the preliminary cause of death was pulmonary haemorrhage.
"We felt because this is an extremely unusual situation we would like to
draw health professionals to the attention for the need to deal with good
infection control when dealing with any patient who presents with a sudden
and unexpected collapse."
One of the victims died at home. Soon after, a woman collapsed after
visiting her GP. She was resuscitated and taken to hospital, but died.
A pathologist conducting a post-mortem on the woman noted the similarity
between the deaths.
"When we had another case over the weekend, the same sort of thing, we
thought this might not be chance...we would really like to know (what it
is) and we are considering all possibilities," infectious diseases expert
Dr Tim Blackmore said.
The list of possible causes of death was "as long as your arm" Dr Blackmore
said.
However, many of them normally had a longer timeframe and "2 people almost
literally dropped dead," Dr Holmes said.
Health authorities would not identify the people who had died.
Dr Holmes said that in 2 cases the victims had died within an hour of
collapsing.
He said that as far as it was known, none of the victims had left the South
Island in the past 6 months.
Dr Blackmore stressed the deaths "did not fit the picture of SARS".
Coughs and colds were "absolutely routine" at this time of year and should
not be over-called, but people who felt they were getting worse should seek
medical attention, authorities said.
Family of the dead people had been told if they felt unwell they should go
to Dunedin Hospital. Health workers who had been in contact with the dead
people were also being monitored.
Tests to narrow down the causes of death of death were continuing, a
Dunedin Hospital spokesman said.
"Preliminary results have been negative, but there's quite a few that are
still in progress. When we cast the net wide for a range of viruses and
bacteria we have them incubating for several weeks before we would call
them negative.
"For routine diagnosis, when we know exactly what we're looking for, we
know the timelines better, but it's been up to several days with some of
these cases where it's still negative results. The longer time goes on, the
longer time goes on the harder it is to sustain a positive diagnosis for
infection."

[The occurrence of 3 deaths associated with sudden pulmonary hemorrhage in
relatively young individuals in a short period of time is of concern. As
mentioned in the newswire, the differential diagnosis is fairly extensive
including both infectious and non-infectious etiologies. Of note, in 1995,
there was an unexplained outbreak of febrile illness associated with acute
pulmonary hemorrhage and some deaths in Nicaragua that was found to be due
to leptospirosis
(<http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/prevguid/m0039519/m0039519.asp>). As
leptospirosis is endemic in New Zealand, it is in the long list of
differentials.
As the newswire article points out, the clinical features of the cases do
not resemble those seen with severe acute respiratory syndrome. This
appears to be an illness with a rapid onset of pulmonary hemorrhage and
death, without a prodromal febrile illness associated with cough and
progressive hypoxia.
We await further information, preferably from authoritative sources in New
Zealand, on the results of the investigation of this cluster of deaths
associated with pulmonary hemorrhage. - Mod.MPP]
