A Hawke's Bay beekeeper has warned the region may be on the verge of a "major" bee disease outbreak if appropriate action is not taken.

Hawke's Bay Hub of Apiculture New Zealand president John Berry said American Foulbrood, known as "AFB", was rampant this year [2017] and could devastate pollination in the region.

"It normally starts up with 1 or 2 infected cells and there are more than 2 billion spores in each cell. Each of those spores is capable of lasting 40 years so you can see why it's a problem if you don't control it."

American Foulbrood kills off bee larva; destroying replacement bees and weakening hives to the point of non-existence.

Mr. Berry said it was particularly concerning because it was capable of spreading at an exponential rate by beekeepers when harvesting honey, and the bees themselves when robbing dead hives of infected honey. "Bad beekeepers spread it amongst their own gear, but bad beekeepers also spread it to beekeepers that are completely innocent and just cop a dose from next door."

The disease is monitored by the American Foulbrood National Pest Management Plan (AFNPMP), whose goal is to eliminate American Foulbrood in New Zealand beehives.

AFNMP manager Clifton King said 66 infected hives had been reported in Hawke's Bay in the past 3 months. "While that's an increase that we're not pleased about, it's still only a small proportion of the total amount of hives that are in Hawke's Bay."

Under the governing organisation's terms, all hives found to be infected with AFB must be notified to the management agency within 7 days and destroyed by burning them. This, however, is an honesty system and the 66 infected hives reported were likely to be an under representation of the total affected by the disease, Mr. King said.

Mr. Berry said while the majority of beekeepers were responsible some were "completely incapable" of recognising the disease and taking appropriate action. "There have been a few incompetent beekeepers in Hawke's Bay for a while but it's spreading very rapidly now because there's far too many hives in the region."

The beekeeper of 45 years said pollination in Hawke's Bay was at "huge risk" if the disease was not addressed.

"The existing beekeepers have always done pollination in the apple, peaches and blueberries and that involves thousands of hives.

"It will have a devastating effect if people like Arataki and Kintails said 'No, we're not going to do pollination anymore, it's not worth it'."

Mr. King said not reporting diseased hives was an offence, but added prosecution was a last resort and often only applied to extreme cases.

[American Foulbrood (AFB) is caused by _Paenibacillus larvae_, a spore-forming gram-positive bacterium known for its ability to cause this severe and notiÔ¨Åable disease of honey bees. _Paenibacillus larvae_ is endemic to bee colonies worldwide. Its spores are highly resilient and can survive in honey for years.

The infection can be transmitted to larvae by nurse bees or by spores remaining at the base of a brood cell. The susceptibility of larvae to AFB disease decreases with increasing age. Larvae cannot be infected later than 53 hours after the egg has hatched.

Larvae can be killed rapidly at an early age when they are curled at the base of uncapped brood cells. Adult worker bees will remove these dead larvae leaving only an empty cell. Other larvae will die later on in their development, when they are in an upright position, filling most of the brood cell. Often the larvae or pupae will die after brood cell capping.
