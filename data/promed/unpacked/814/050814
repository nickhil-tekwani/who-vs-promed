Two Canadian farmers have been ordered to get rid of a herd of water
buffalo because authorities say the animals could be carrying mad cow
disease (BSE, bovine spongiform encephalopathy).
[The farmers] imported the animals from Denmark in January as
part of a long-term plan to start producing milk and mozzarella cheese
from the buffalo, the first herd of its kind in Canada.
But soon afterwards, the first reported case of BSE in Denmark prompted
some countries to ban Danish dairy products and meat. Canada has a strict
policy of forbidding the importation of animals in which BSE has been
detected.
Even though there have been no documented cases of water buffalo
contracting the disease, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency has told the
[farmers] their 27 animals must be removed from Canada or destroyed by next
month.
The order has devastated the family, which had mortgaged their farm on
Vancouver Island to purchase the herd and develop an associated dairy
business. They are now asking a
court to save their herd. "These animals haven't been contaminated," [one
of them] said. "They should be grazing in the fields right now."
Before the detection of BSE in Denmark, the [farmers] had received federal
approval to import the animals.
While they await an uncertain future, the 27 buffalo are being quarantined
at the farm outside Victoria. Eight of the 27 were born in Canada, while 9
of the original 19 were shipped from Bulgaria to Denmark, where the 10
others were born.
Federal food-inspection scientists said the destruction order was a
precautionary measure designed to protect Canadian cattle and the export
trade.
"Any case of BSE in Canada would be devastating to the cattle industry,"
said agency official Dr Debbie Barr. There has been 1 recorded case of
BSE in Canadian cattle.
