Current situation -- week 1/2011 [3-9 Jan 2011]
-----------------------------------------------
Consultation rates for influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory
infection (ARI) increased in 20 out of 41 countries that reported on this
indicator. The age groups affected varied between countries, but in about
half the countries increases were seen in all age groups. Of the 10
countries that present a baseline, 6 reported clinical consultation rates
above the national threshold (France, Ireland, Israel, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, and Switzerland). 4 countries reported high influenza
activity: Denmark, Ireland, Norway, and the United Kingdom (England). Among
43 countries for which information on geographical spread was available, 14
were experiencing widespread activity, 5 regional activity, 9 local
activity, and the remaining 15 no or sporadic activity.

Virological situation -- week 1/2011 [3-9 Jan 2011]
---------------------------------------------------
This week, pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 and influenza B remain the
predominant viruses circulating in the Region with relatively few influenza
A(H3N2) viruses being detected. Pandemic A(H1N1) 2009 dominated in 18
countries, influenza A and B co-dominated in 5 countries, while influenza B
was dominant in 4 countries.

Sentinel physicians collected 2005 respiratory specimens, of which 877 (44
per cent) were positive for influenza virus: 648 (74 per cent) were
influenza A, and 229 (26 per cent) were influenza B. Of the influenza A
viruses, 592 were subtyped: 536 (91 per cent) as pandemic A(H1) and 56 (9
per cent) as A(H3). In the 23 countries testing 20 or more sentinel
specimens, influenza positivity ranged from 5 per cent to 68 per cent, with
a median of 46 per cent (mean: 43 per cent). Influenza positivity was above
60 per cent in 5 countries: Belgium, Ireland, Israel, Lithuania, and the
Netherlands. Among specimens tested from non-sentinel sources, 5085 were
positive for influenza: 3707 (73 per cent) influenza A and 1378 (27 per
cent) influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 2047 were subtyped: 1977 (97
per cent) as pandemic A(H1) and 70 (3 per cent) as A(H3). Respiratory
syncytial virus was also reported by some countries.

Since week 40/2010 [4-10 Oct 2010], 399 influenza viruses have been
characterized antigenically: 179 were A(H1) pandemic A/California/7/2009
(H1N1)-like; 162 were B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (B/Victoria/2/87 lineage); 45
were A(H3) A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)-like; 12 were B/Florida/4/2006-like
(B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage); and 1 was B/Bangladesh/3333/2007-like
(B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage). Based on the genetic characterization of 56
influenza viruses, 41 belonged to the pandemic A/California/7/2009 A(H1N1)
clade; 5 belonged to the A(H3) clade represented by A/Perth/16/2009; 4
belonged to the subgroup represented by A/Hong Kong/2121/2010 in the
A/Victoria/208/2009 A(H3) clade; 4 belonged to the B/Bangladesh/3333/2007
clade (Yamagata lineage); 1 to the B/Florida/4/2006 clade (Yamagata
lineage); and 1 to the B/Brisbane/60/2008 clade (Victoria lineage).

Cumulative virological update -- weeks 40/2010-1/2011 [4 Oct 2010-9 Jan 2011]
-----------------------------------------------------
A total of 15 860 influenza virus detections were reported, of which 11 244
(71 per cent) were influenza A and 4616 (29 per cent) influenza B. Of the
influenza A viruses, 6539 were subtyped: 6104 (93 per cent) as pandemic
influenza A(H1), 433 (7 per cent) as influenza A(H3), and 2 (less than 1
per cent) as influenza A(H1).

Comment
-------
ILI and ARI consultation rates have increased particularly in countries of
the northern and western part of the European Region. Widespread activity
has been reported by an increasing number of countries. Influenza activity
is still low in other countries in the WHO European Region; but, current
data may be incomplete following holidays in several countries. In week
1/2011 [3-9 Jan 2011], across the Region as a whole, 44 per cent of
sentinel samples tested positive for influenza, corroborating the
widespread influenza activity. The co-circulation of influenza B with the
pandemic A(H1N1) 2009 virus contrasts with the 2009/2010 season when little
co-circulation of influenza B was seen.

[The returns from sentinel practices put the current situation in Europe in
perspective. About half (44 per cent) of respiratory infections could be
attributed to influenza virus infection, respiratory syncytial virus
possibly being a significant minor component. Of the influenza positives,
71 per cent were influenza A-type virus infections and 29 per cent B-type
influenza virus infections. Of the A-type viruses 93 per cent were similar
to the pandemic H1N1 strain, less than 1 per cent were similar to the
previous seasonal H1N1 strain, and 7 per cent were B-type viruses. In
contrast to the 2009/2010 outbreak, co-circulation of B-type influenza
virus is a feature of the 2010/1011 outbreak. - Mod.CP]
