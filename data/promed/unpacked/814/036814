Temporary measures adopted at EU-level to mitigate risk of FMD
spreading from Libya via animal transport vehicles
---------------------------------------------------
Following notification by Libya of an outbreak of foot-and-mouth
disease (FMD), the European Commission yesterday adopted temporary
measures to prevent the possible spread of the virus into the EU via
livestock transport vehicles.
FMD is one of the most contagious viral diseases of cattle, sheep,
goats, and pigs and though it is not harmful to human health, it can
have devastating economic consequences. The EU does not allow imports
of live animals or animal products of species susceptible to FMD from
countries in North Africa. However, since the virus can survive in a
contaminated environment for several weeks, there is concern that
vehicles having unloaded susceptible livestock, or returning
registered horses from Libya, might potentially be contaminated by
the virus.
The precautionary measures decided upon today therefore specify the
conditions for reinforced controls of cleansing and disinfection of
animal transport vehicles on arrival to the EU. The measures were
decided in agreement with the Standing Committee on the Food Chain
and Animal Health, representing the veterinary services of the EU
Member States.
The last outbreak of FMD in Libya was reported in 1994. The current
outbreak is the first ever recorded outbreak of this particular
serotype north of the Sahara. The relevant authorities in Libya have
taken measures to contain the disease, but the significant delay
between the first suspect case on 1 May 2003 and the confirmation of
the disease on 18 Jun 2003 means that a spread of the disease to
neighbouring countries cannot be fully excluded. These measures may
therefore be extended to cover additional countries.
