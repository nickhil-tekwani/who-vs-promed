Key points
----------
- A sea lion on Kangaroo Island [South Australia] was found to have died from tuberculosis
- The disease can be passed on to humans but only with very close contact
- Scientists who wrote a paper on the discovery hope it prompts more research

An animal scientist wants more Australian sea lions tested for tuberculosis after one of the creatures was found to have died from the disease on Kangaroo Island.

The 3-year-old juvenile sea lion was found dead on a beach at Kingscote in 2017, but the case was only reported in the Journal of Wildlife Diseases last week [week of 4 Jan 2021; see reference below].

Paper author Rachael Gray, from the University of Sydney, said tuberculosis had been detected in seals and sea lions around the world but it was rare in Australian waters.

She said the Kangaroo Island case was the 1st time tuberculosis had been detected in a sea lion's abdomen, rather than its lungs, in South Australia.

The island is home to one of Australia's largest colonies of sea lions which are considered endangered by the International Union for Conservation.

Dr Gray said while the discovery of tuberculosis in one of the animals was a public health issue, there was no "need to panic".

She said the main threat to the public was from finding dead or dying animals, and the risk at Seal Bay Conservation Park -- where tourists can join sea lions on the beach -- was "not present".

"It's mainly transmitted in people having really close contact to infected animals -- people like me: researchers, people involved in animal rescue, zookeepers," she said.

However, she warned people not to touch sick or dead seals or sea lions.

"If you found a sea lion or fur seal on a beach in a remote area, you're better off contacting the appropriate authorities and letting them know an animal is there," Dr Gray said.

The bacterium causing tuberculosis in seals and sea lions, _Mycobacterium pinnipedii_, is different to the one that causes the disease in humans -- but humans can catch the seal version.

Zookeepers in Western Australia in the late 1980s and early 1990s caught it from sea lions in captivity.

"If you had a sea lion that was actually positive, it's like any respiratory disease -- which we know a lot more about after COVID -- they have to cough on you and the aerosols in the cough would have to get into your respiratory system," Dr Gray said.

"If the animal has an intestinal form of tuberculosis, which this case actually did, the bacteria can also be passed in the faeces and in some cases, [we] also think, in the urine.

"We need to keep in mind safety and hygiene when we deal with any animal, really."

The South Australian (SA) Department for Environment and Water, Biosecurity SA, and SA Health were notified of the tuberculosis case after results of the necropsy came back.

A SA Health spokeswoman said the risk to the public was deemed to be "minimal".

Push for 'population surveillance'
----------------------------------
In their article, Dr Gray and Adelaide-based PhD candidate Scott Lindsay called for "population surveillance" among sea lions to assess the threat posed to the animals by tuberculosis and other diseases.

"It's the 1st time in a while, in a sea lion that it's been detected, but I think it's only because we don't get many opportunities to do really thorough disease investigations in these animals," Dr Gray said.

"A lot of them will just disappear and die in the ocean rather than actually hauling out on land and in a site [we] can actually find."

Tony Coppins, who runs tours for people to swim with seals, sea lions, and dolphins on Kangaroo Island, said tourists were "fairly well versed in keeping their distance from wild animals."

Dr Gray said hookworm was a much greater threat to sea lions than tuberculosis. About 40 per cent of the species failed to reach adulthood, and a considerable proportion of the premature deaths could be attributed to hookworm, she said.

Abstract
"We detail a novel presentation of tuberculosis associated with intestinal perforation in an endangered Australian sea lion (_Neophoca cinerea_) from South Australian waters and confirm the presence of this disease in the region of highest pup production. In February 2017, a 3-yr-old juvenile male died shortly after hauling out at the Kingscote beach on Kangaroo Island. On postmortem examination, we found a mid-jejunal intestinal perforation and partial obstruction (from a strangulating fibrous and granulomatous mesenteric mass), a marked multicentric abdominal fibrosing granulomatous lymphadenitis, and a large volume serosanguinous peritoneal effusion. Acid-fast bacteria were detected postmortem in cytologic preparations of the mesenteric lymph node and in histologic sections of jejunum and the encircling mass. Mycobacterial infection was confirmed by positive culture after 3 wk. Molecular typing using mycobacterial interspersed repetitive-unit-variable-number tandem-repeat typing with 12-locus analysis identified _Mycobacterium pinnipedii_. This case highlights the need for vigilance of zoonotic disease risk when handling pinnipeds, including in the absence of specific respiratory signs or grossly apparent pulmonary pathology. Increased serologic population surveillance is recommended to assess the species' risk from this and other endemic diseases, especially given its endangered status."

Although human TB is usually caused by _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, other species within MTBC can also cause TB in humans. MTBC is composed of genetically related species that include _M. tuberculosis_, _M. bovis_ (the usual cause of bovine tuberculosis), _M. bovis_-BCG, _M. microti_ (a pathogen in rodents), _M. caprae_ (a pathogen in multiple mammalian species), _M. pinnipedii_ (a pathogen primarily in seals), _M. mungi_ (a pathogen in banded mongooses), and _M. canettii_ and _M. africanum_ (both cause human TB in Africa). There are 2 additional members of MTBC, _M. dassie_ (a pathogen of hyrax, aka dassie, a small, herbivorous mammal) and _M. orygis_.

Kangaroo Island (155 km or 96 miles long and 55 km or 35 miles at its widest, is a tourist destination (https://www.tourkangarooisland.com.au), 13 km (8 miles) off the coast of South Australia. The island can be reached by ferry and or plane from the city of Adelaide. "The Seal Bay Conservation Park on Kangaroo Island's south coast is the only place in the world where you can walk among endangered Australian sea lions." (https://www.australia.com/en-us/places/adelaide-and-surrounds/guide-to-kangaroo-island.html).

[In other publications regarding this incident, Dr Grey further indicates that "there is risk of transmission for researchers handling the animals, as well as anyone involved in animal rescue or washed-up carcass disposal, or those working at rehabilitation centres and involved in the disease diagnostic process." (https://www.9news.com.au/national/sea-lion-diagnosed-with-tuberculosis-triggers-public-health-concerns/13492b29-5761-464c-8e4e-12e14593f619).

In 1991 tuberculosis was also diagnosed in some Otariid seals.

"Tuberculosis was diagnosed in 10 of 16 otariid seals upon post mortem examination. The species involved were New Zealand fur seals (_Arctocephalus forsteri_), Australian sea lions (_Neophoca cinerea_), and an Australian fur seal (_Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus_). 5 seals died, 4 as a direct result of mycobacterial infection. One seal died of an unrelated disease. The remaining 10 animals were subsequently tuberculin tested and then killed and necropsied. Tuberculous lesions were seen in 5. Gross pathological changes were most commonly seen in the respiratory system. However, a generalized infection, a case with lesions confined to the liver and draining lymph nodes, and a case with tuberculous meningitis also were seen. Histological lesions were characterized by spindle cell proliferation and necrosis without mineralization or giant cell formation. The mycobacterium isolated was identified as belonging to the _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ complex but it appeared to be unique. Intradermal tuberculin testing showed promise as a diagnostic aid; however, the results were not statistically significant. Circumstances suggest that the initial infection was present when the seals were captured from the wild."

Pinnipeds are likely subject to more tuberculosis than we realize. For decades we have focused on domestic animals, food safety, and human safety. However, we are learning other species (pinnipeds being an example) are capable of contracting and possibly spreading the disease. - Mod.TG]

[_Mycobacterium pinnipedii_ is a member of the _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ complex isolated from pinnipeds (seals, sea lions, elephant seals). Although pinnipeds appear to be the natural host for this pathogen, it was found to be also pathogenic in guinea pigs, rabbits, humans, and tapirs. Pathological findings of _M. pinnipeddii_ infections are mainly granulomatous lesions in the peripheral lymph nodes, lungs, pleura, spleen, and peritoneum. - Mod.PMB
