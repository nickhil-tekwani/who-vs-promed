While the cause of the disease may not be clear, it seems the animals are
developing heart failure which is what actually kills them. Part of the
symptoms described are typical for heart failure. (quote: "The symptoms of
the disease are: ... specific posture [?, hard and frequent breathing",
... "The only outer sign of the disease is evident stagnation in peripheral
venous network. The death in fact is the result of edema of lungs").
Probably the animals are developing acute myocarditis (most likely viral)
which leads to heart failure. It would be interesting if more info could be
provided on the findings in the heart: was the heart enlarged, what were
the microscopic findings - any signs of myocarditis (e.g. lymphocyte
infiltration)? I am wondering if we could also have more information on the
specific posture. Do the animals prefer the orthopnoic position (to remain
sitting), another typical sign of heart failure, in order to breathe easier?
Whatever the cause, symptomatic treatment is important and in that case it
is crucial that intensive treatment of heart failure (with diuretics,
inotropic/cardiotonic agents, etc.) is started immediately as part of the
therapeutic regimen.

Exposure to a toxin should be considered whenever a cluster of deaths occur
in a zoo setting, either from a source in the environment (if the affected
animals share an enclosure) or perhaps in the diet (if they were from
separate housing areas).
As far as a possible infectious etiology, one agent which can cause
widespread organ involvement and heart failure (which seems to be indicated
by the signs described) would be encephalomyocarditis virus. Toxoplasmosis
can also cause multisystemic lesions and death in nonhuman primates, but it
might not be expected to cause such a tight cluster of disease. Rodent
exposure is often a major factor in the zoo environment (either from feral
rodents, rodents on exhibit in nearby areas, or from rodent carcasses
provided as food) so the potential of exposure to lymphocytic
choriomeningitis virus should be considered.

Regarding sudden death in squirrel monkeys at the Moscow zoo, three
conditions come to mind. Encephalomyocarditis virus can be fatal in
squirrel monkeys; cardiovascular collapse secondary to myocarditis may
yield the noted gross lesions. A veterinary pathologist would easily be
able to document the characteristic histopathologic changes of myocarditis
and pancreatic necrosis caused by ECMV in this species. Virus isolation
and/or serology will aid.
Another differential I might consider is measles/rubeola virus (a
morbillivirus). Fatal in _Aotus_, _Saimiri_ and marmosets, infection is
usually via the respiratory tract. Colonies typically will have a 100%
seroconversion rate in an outbreak. Lungs are edematous and mottled.
Histologically the characteristic Warthin-Finkeldy cells (lymphocytic
syncytial cells) within the lymph nodes are a classic finding, as well as
syncytia in skin, intestinal tract, liver, pancreatic ducts, lower urinary
tract; may see a nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis as well.
Hypovitaminosis C should be considered perhaps. This is a vascular event
with disseminated petechial hemorrhages; encephalohematoma is described in
nonhuman primates. This is also well described in _Saimiri sciureus_.
Have tissues been collected for histologic evaluation?
