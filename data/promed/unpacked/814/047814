UK - Doubts raised over slaughter policy
---------------------------------------
A leading expert on foot-and-mouth disease has questioned the scientific
basis for the huge slaughter programme to tackle the crisis in the UK. Dr
Alex Donaldson, head of the Pirbright Laboratory at the Institute for
Animal Health, suggests that predictions for the airborne spread of the
virus may have been overestimated. But the UK Government's chief scientific
adviser, Professor David King, said the analysis on which the mass
slaughter was based took into account all the ways in which the disease
could spread. The latest development follows suggestions from a farmer's
group that culling was paced to eliminate foot-and-mouth disease before the
general election - an allegation refuted by MAFF.
Dr Donaldson, who is a member of the government's foot-and-mouth advisory
team, published his research findings in the Veterinary Record journal. He
told the BBC: "We feel that with the results we've got, the probability of
spread on the wind from cattle and sheep on infected premises was very
low." It was unlikely that infected sheep and cattle would transmit the
virus more than 1 km, and in most cases it would probably be only about 200
metres, he said. Only in the case of pigs, he said, was there greater need
for caution, while the government's decision to order a policy of mass
slaughter had been made after studying mathematical models which
"oversimplified" forecasts for the disease. A judgement would have to be
made as to whether the culling policy was "justified or over the top" he
added. "I think there are some pointers which would suggest to me that it
may have been excessive."
But Prof King told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the early forecasts
of how the disease would spread, made by analysing the first outbreaks, had
been "remarkably accurate." It was these statistical models on which the
mass slaughter policy was based, he said. "There is a multiplicity of
routes of infection - airborne is just one and that is the only route which
Dr Donaldson is dealing with in his paper." He continued: "Analysis of the
outbreak shows that where contiguous cull did not take place, there were
still infected premises developing. Very simply, the proof is in the
pudding - the policy was implemented at the point at which the outbreak was
out of control and it has worked."
But Anthony Gibson, from the southwest branch of the National Farmers'
Union, called Dr Donaldson's findings "an appalling indictment of a
dreadful policy." "It is clear that unless animals were within 100 m or 200
m of infected animals, they were at no risk. We have hundreds of thousands
of animals being slaughtered unnecessarily, untold human anguish has been
caused, hundreds of millions of pounds of public expenditure has been made.
It could never possibly be justified."
A number of farmers were planning to take legal action against MAFF, Mr.
Gibson said.
Foot-and-mouth facts:
Total number of confirmed foot-and-mouth cases in the UK 1604 - 1 on Tuesday
2 718 000 animals slaughtered
87 000 animals awaiting slaughter
38 000 carcasses awaiting disposal
Hundreds of thousands of apparently healthy animals have been slaughtered
under Ministry of Agriculture "contiguous culling" rules on farms
surrounding a confirmed case.

The current edition of the Veterinary Record - May 12, Volume 148, Number
19 - has two short communications that relate to the current FMD epidemic
in the UK.
Relative resistance of pigs to infection by natural aerosols of FMD virus -
A.I. Donaldson, S. Alexandersen; concludes that: "the probability of pigs
being infected as a result of exposure to a plume of FMD virus under field
conditions is very low". . ."the results of computer simulations showed
that the airborne spread of the UK/2001 strain of the FMD virus between pig
herds over a distance of greater than 0.1 km would require more than 100
pigs to be affected on the source farm."
Relative risks of the uncontrollable (airborne) spread of FMD by different
species - A.I. Donaldson, S. Alexanderson, J.H. Sorensen, T. Mikklesen;
Specifically addresses the 2 main 'planks' of the slaughter policy adopted
by Govt./MAFF in the UK 2001 epidemic: slaughter and disposal of animals on
infected premises within 24 hours or reporting, and culling within 48
hours of susceptible animals in all premises contiguous to the infected
premises. The authors state that experimental and field evidence broadly
support slaughter and disposal of animals on infected premises within 24
hours of reporting. However, they are highly critical of the 48-hour
contiguous cull policy. They criticise the advice given by the
biomathematicians from Imperial College (Anderson, Ferguson and Donnelly),
on which this policy was based. And they are very critical of the
theoretical assumptions and "over-simplications" in the modelling work, and
conclude that the flawed model would 'in certain circumstances generate
inaccurate forecasts." They say that "when the disease is diagnosed and
movement control is fully implemented around an infected premises, the
animals on contiguous premises should not be at risk from uncontrollable
spread, that is, from airborne spread unless (a) there are pigs or very
large numbers of cattle or sheep on the affected premises with early
clinical signs AND (b) the concentration of the virus in the plume was at
the same or higher concentration than the threshold concentration required
to infect them."
The authors go on to discuss rational approaches to the assessment and
management of the risks posed to animals on farms neighbouring infected
premises.
They conclude: "The implementation of the 48-hour contiguous herd culling
policy has resulted in the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of animals
and created severe disposal problems. The potential benefits of culling all
animals on all contiguous premises within 48 hours should be weighed
against the likelihood that many of the contiguous premises did not contain
infected animals, the impact of having to dispose of the resultant
carcasses and the diversion of very limited veterinary resources and
support staff from surveillance activities."
Personal comments: In the light of the mounting evidence of a major policy
mistake - and these papers in particular - I think it's time the UK
veterinary profession - the
veterinary professional organisations and individual veterinary surgeons -
finally said 'enough's enough' and refused to play any further part in the
unnecessary and unjustified 48-hour contiguous cull. In my opinion, it is
no longer acceptable to claim to have merely been 'following orders' or to
say 'we didn't know'. I recommend reading the articles in full - Veterinary
Record, May 12 2001, Volume 148, Number 19, pages 600-604.

[This concern is rising in the UK, and elsewhere, about the true risk to
herds and flocks within the 3 km radius. The UK courts have already started
to excuse some flocks/herds from culling orders, specifically when they
have failed to come down with disease or display other evidence of
infections when, for various reasons, culling was delayed long beyond the
normal incubation period. Some flocks under culling orders but delayed
slaughter were also upwind, which made the blanket application of the rule
even harder to understand. All of these "mistakes" provide an admirable
opportunity to test these flocks and see if infection did occur or confirm
freedom, and to refine the "rules" -- something which should be happening
throughout the epidemic. All of which goes to show the truth of Mary
Woolridge's comment that all computer models are wrong but they do help you
think. The thinking seems to have been missing. Or to use one of my own
quotes to my students, "Why should I believe you when you have a computer
pallor and no mud on your shoes?" - Mod.MHJ]
