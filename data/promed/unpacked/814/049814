The Southwest Utah Public Health Department is
investigating the recent confirmation of
tularemia found in some cats in the Kanab area.
Tularemia, sometimes called rabbit fever, is an
illness caused by the bacteria _Francisella
tularensis_ and is often spread by deer flies and
ticks or exposure to the blood of infected animals.

People can be infected by tularemia, but it
cannot be spread from person to person, says
Lisa Starr, SWUPHD communicable disease nurse.
Since this disease was found in domestic cats,
we want to inform the public of its presence and how to avoid infection.

The symptoms of tularemia include flu-like
illness such as sudden fever, body aches and
coughing. If the infection is caused by an insect
bite or a cut, it usually results in a skin ulcer and swollen glands.

The risk of getting tularemia is often associated
with skinning infected rabbits or eating rabbit meat that is not cooked well.

People can help prevent infection by :
- Reducing insect bites by wearing protective
clothing and using repellents containing DEET.
- Search for ticks often and remove attached ticks immediately.
- Do not handle sick or dead animals.
- Wear gloves when skinning or handling animals, especially wild rabbits.
- Stay away from stray cats.

Contact your doctor if you think you have been
exposed. For more information, call the SWUPHD
Kanab office at 644-2537 or visit www.swuhealth.org.

[Tularemia results from infection by _Francisella
tularensis_ (formerly known as _Pasteurella
tularensis_), a gram-negative, non­motile
coccobacillus. 2 subspecies exist: _F. tularensis
tularensis_ (also known as Jellison type A) and
_F. tularensis holarctica_ (Jellison type B). _F.
tularensis tularensis_ is found in lagomorphs in
North America and is highly virulent for humans
and domestic rabbits; _F. tularensis holarctica_
is less virulent and occurs in beaver, muskrats
and voles in North America and in hares and small rodents in Eurasia.

_F. tularensis_ can be transmitted by ingestion,
inhalation, arthropod­borne transfer or direct
contact through the skin and mucous membranes.
Organisms are found in the blood and tissues of
infected animals and can survive for long periods
on fomites including food and water. Aquatic
animals may develop tularemia after being
immersed in contaminated water. Carnivores
sometimes become infected after ingesting a
contaminated carcass. Vectors for _F. tularensis
tularensis_ include ticks (including _Dermacentor
andersoni_, _D. variabilis_ and _Amblyomma
americanum_) and biting flies (particularly
deerflies). _F. tularensis holarctica_ is also
transmitted by mosquitoes in Russia. Rarely, the
organism is spread by animal bites.

_F. tularensis_ can survive for long periods of
time in arthropod vectors and in the environment.
Individual flies may carry the organism for 2
weeks and ticks throughout their lifetimes.
Viable bacteria can also be found for weeks to
months in the carcasses and hides of infected
animals and in fomites including grain dust,
straw, water, soil and bedbugs. This organism is
highly resistant to freezing; live organisms have
been found after 3 years in rabbit meat stored at ­15 deg C [5 deg F].

However, this short article gives us no
indication of how the animals contacted the
disease. While it may be likely to conclude it is
arthropod borne, then warnings to the community should be forthcoming.

[This same report is available at the Southwest
Utah Public Health Department website at
<http://www.swuhealth.org/index.html>. According
to CDC statistics, during the period 2000-2006
there were a total of 873 cases of human
tularemia reported in the USA. In the same
period, there were a total of 15 cases reported
in Utah, with annual reports ranging from 1-4
cases. (see
<http://www.cdc.gov/tularemia/Surveillance/Tul_CasesbyState.html>
for the full table of number of cases reported each year by state, 2000-2006.).

For a good map of the USA showing the
distribution of reported tularemia cases during
the period 2000 -2006, see

ProMED-mail would greatly appreciated more
information on the number of felines with
tularemia infection confirmed in Kanab Utah.
