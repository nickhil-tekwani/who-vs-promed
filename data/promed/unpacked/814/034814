The Ministry of Health of El Salvador reported an increase in gastrointestinal diseases and rotavirus [infections] in the 1st week of January 2012, totaling 11 521 cases.

According to a report provided by the health minister, Maria Isabel Rodriguez, during the 1st week of January 2012 there were 4112 more consultations for diarrhea than those registered during the same period in 2011.

In addition, the official confirmed that of 109 samples tested for rotavirus in the 1st week of January 2012, 51 were positive.

Rodriguez attributed the increase in consultations for diarrhea or gastroenteritis to Salvadorans drinking contaminated water, the lack of hand washing, and the dry season.

Regarding rotavirus [infection], manifested through vomiting and diarrhea, the official explained that 5 year old children are most vulnerable to becoming infected with the disease.

Rodriguez called on parents to comply with preventive measures issued by the Ministry of Health to protect their children from rotavirus infection and gastrointestinal diseases.

[Diarrhoea is a symptom of infections caused by a host of bacterial, viral and parasitic organisms, most of which are spread by faeces-contaminated water. Infection is more common when there is a shortage of clean water for drinking, cooking and cleaning. Rotavirus and Escherichia coli are the two most common causes of diarrhoea in developing countries. Rotavirus infection has been a recurrent problem in El Salvador.

Children who die from diarrhoea often suffer from underlying malnutrition, which makes them more vulnerable to diarrhoea. Each diarrhoeal episode, in turn, makes their malnutrition even worse. Diarrhoea is a leading cause of malnutrition in children under five years old. Water contaminated with human faeces, for example, from sewage, septic tanks and latrines, is of particular concern. Animal faeces also contain microorganisms that can cause diarrhoea.

Rotavirus is the leading cause of gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach and intestines), which causes severe diarrhea among children worldwide. The current outbreak in El Salvador illustrates the magnitude of the problem There are now two licensed vaccines for rotavirus infection in the United States and elsewhere: RotaTeq® and Rotarix®. In March 2010, FDA became aware of the presence PCV1 in Rotarix® and DNA from PCV1 and PCV2 in RotaTeq®. These viruses are not known to cause any infection or illness in people. On May 14, 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration revised its recommendations for rotavirus vaccines for the prevention of the disease in infants and has determined that it is appropriate for clinicians and healthcare professionals to resume the use of Rotarix® and to continue the use of RotaTeq®.

El Salvador is the smallest and the most densely populated country in Central America. The country's capital city and largest city is San Salvador.
