2 more deaths last week took the dengue death toll to 83 [a case

A statement by the Health Ministry's Disease Control Division for the
period of Oct 23-29 said an 18-year-old girl died in Segamat, Johor.
It said the girl was admitted to Segamat Hospital on Oct 19 but died

The 2nd death was that of a 4-year-old girl from Jempol, Negeri
Sembilan on Oct 29 due to dengue haemorrhagic fever. She was admitted
to Seremban Hospital on Oct 27.

The statement said 75 deaths [a CFR of approximately 304 per 100 000]
from dengue fever were reported at the same time last year [2004].

Overall, a total of 824 dengue fever cases were reported last week, a
drop of 240 cases or 22.6 per cent compared to 1064 cases in the previous week.

Up to last Saturday, the accumulated dengue fever cases [so far in
2005] stood at 32 950 cases, including 1635 cases of dengue
haemorrhagic fever [DHF], an increase of 33.4 per cent compared to 24
699 cases during the same period last year [2004].

Up to Oct 22, a total of 9381 cases were confirmed positive -- 8897
dengue fever and 484 dengue haemorrhagic fever cases [DHF].

The Centre for Health Protection urges people to guard against Dengue
fever after it confirmed another imported case involving a
50-year-old woman. The woman was visiting Bangladesh when she
developed a fever, chills, headache, muscle pain and sore eyes on 15
Oct 2005. She returned to Hong Kong on October 21 and was admitted to
Princess Margaret Hospital. She recovered and was discharged 3 days
later. None of her home contacts had any symptoms.

This brings the total number of Dengue fever cases in 2005 to 23, all
imported. People are reminded to stay alert to the threat of the
disease and to help in the fight against mosquito breeding.

During the current epidemiological week 1100 dengue fever cases were
diagnosed, 67 of them were dengue hemorrhagic fever (6.1 percent),
and the ratio of dengue fever to dengue hemorrhagic fever is 15:1.
Cumulated case toll for 2005 is 33 897; 6.2 percent of them
correspond to dengue hemorrhagic fever (2100 cases), and the ratio of
dengue fever to dengue hemorrhagic fever is 15:1. Cumulated morbidity
rate is 127.5 per 100 000 inhabitants. Circulating serotypes are 1,
2, 3, and 4. Cumulated case toll for this period had a 34.1 percent
increase with respect to the number of cumulated cases up to the same
date for last year [2004]. In the current epidemiological week there
have been no deaths caused by dengue fever; however, there is an
adjustment for Week No 41, in which the death of a 21-year-old woman
from Falcon State was confirmed.

There was a 2.0 percent reduction in the number of cases compared to
the past week, and the epidemiological situation corresponds to an
epidemic (see the endemic channel). 52.6 percent of cases were
reported in persons less than 15 years old; 21.0 percent of cases
occurred in persons 15 to 24 years old. Federal Entities reporting

Viet Nam has had more than 35 700 dengue cases so far this year, up 4
per cent compared to the same period last year [2004], the National
Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE) reported.

Pham Ngoc Dinh, deputy head of NIHE, said most of the dengue cases
had been in the southern and central provinces, with only 600-700
cases occurring in northern provinces.

Khanh Hoa Province had the largest number of people infected with
dengue fever, nearly 4000 cases, Dinh said. The province was
currently seeing an average of more than 50 dengue victims a day, he said.

According to Khanh Hoa health officials, this year's drought led
local people to store water in tanks near or in their homes. But many
have not covered the tanks properly, creating ideal conditions for
the larvae of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, which transmits dengue viruses.

Since September, Khanh Hoa's Preventive Health Centre has attempted
to prevent the transmission of dengue by using chemicals to kill
mosquitoes and their larvae.

Dengue fever has already infected 24 545 people in the Mekong Delta
in 2005. Of the delta's provinces, Dong Thap and An Giang have the
largest number of victims, with a total of 7350 people affected.

NIHE reported 36 deaths [a CFR of 490 per 100 000] from the disease
so far in 2005 in Viet Nam. It has also instructed provinces
nationwide to strictly monitor dengue fever and take actions to
prevent the disease.
