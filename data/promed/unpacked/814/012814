Italian authorities reported the 1st confirmed case of bird flu in
the country. The finding was made after testing more than 1000 wild
birds, the Health Ministry said in a statement adding that it's a
"low pathogenic"' version that isn't life-threatening.
A wild duck bearing the H5N1 virus was found [the virus found or the
duck? in case the duck - was it hunted? found sick? dead? - Mod.AS]
at a testing center in Padua, Italy, the ministry said.
The virus found "is genetically very similar to the one found in wild
European water fowl and therefore is of no threat to public health."
Health Minister Francesco Storace has urged Italians not to
exaggerate the threat of the virus, while at the same time promising
greater controls on the food supply.

Experts on Thursday [10 Nov 2005] sought to ease alarm over the
detection of bird flu in a wild duck, saying the strain of virus was
much weaker than that found in Asia and posed no threat to public
health.
"Although the codename is the same one used to denote the Asian
virus, the form here is completely different," said experts at the
bird flu testing lab in Lagnaro near Padua .
On Wednesday [9 Nov 2005], the lab said that a migratory wild duck
had tested positive for H5N1, the codename used for the deadly strain
of bird flu virus which has caused more than 60 deaths in Asia.
But the lab stressed on Thursday that "this strain has a lower
pathogenic level and is therefore less aggressive than the Asian
form. Its presence in European water fowl is normal."
It said the strain found in the wild duck was closely related to
other weak forms of H5 bird virus that have long been present in
migratory birds in Europe, particularly in Sweden, Denmark and the
Netherlands.
"This does not change the current situation in Italy as regards to
bird flu," the lab concluded.
Professor Donato Greco, the head of the Health Ministry's centre for
disease control, also said that "this is a far less virulent strain
of bird flu virus and one which has nothing to do with the one
circulating in the Far East."
But Italy's anti-hunting lobby immediately called for a ban on wild
bird hunting. A spokesman for the lobby, Andrea Zanoni, said that
"it's vital that hunting be stopped. Dozens of Asian and European
regions have taken this responsible decision after detecting the 1st
cases of bird flu on their territory."
"We must avoid hunters and their dogs coming into contact with the
virus and in their turn, becoming potential vehicles for the spread
of H5N1," Zanoni said .
He noted that there were some 60 000 hunters in the region of Veneto
surrounding Padua with 10 000 specialising in duck hunting around
Padua, Venice and Rovigo. But Veneto regional health councillor,
Flavio Tosi, dismissed the campaigners' concerns .
"This is groundless alarmism. Nothing will change with regard to
hunting," he said. "We must remember that there have been very few
cases of the virus passing from animals to humans in Asia despite the
region's population density and poor hygienic conditions. A bird flu
pandemic is about as likely as an asteroid hitting the earth," Tosi
said .
A top Italian veterinary researcher said in October 2005 that H5N1
was probably already present in Italy but posed no threat to humans
because it was a milder strain than the one found in Asia.
Mauro Delogu of Bologna University's Department of Veterinary Public
Health said that "at the moment, the risk to humans is zero. The
ability of the virus to pass from wild animals to humans has not been
completely proven."
He stressed that the alarm in Italy was unwarranted, arguing that the
real problem was to prevent H5N1 passing from wild birds to domestic
ones. "Then it could turn into a more aggressive virus," Delogu said.
Concern over bird flu has increased in Europe after H5N1 spread to
European Russia, Turkey, Croatia and Romania through migratory birds.
Italy has banned imports of live poultry, game birds and poultry
products from Croatia, Romania and other Balkan states. It has also
begun inspecting poultry farms and testing captured migratory birds
as well as temporarily banning street poultry markets on national
soil.
Meanwhile, farmers have been staging protests over the fall in
poultry sales, saying the industry had been "brought to its knees" by
the bird flu scare.

[The term "duck" is a general one, applicable to various wild or
domesticated swimming birds of the family Anatidae,
characteristically having a broad, flat bill, short legs, and webbed
feet. A precise identification of the bird from Veneto (precise
location not given) reportedly found infected with a LPAI H5N1 strain
will help. It will also help to know if the bird was hunted and about
its clinical condition.
Ornithological information about affected wild birds is of crucial
value. Fortunately, some of our requests for such data are fruitful;
the following item is one of them. - Mod.AS].

[In response to our request [see 20051105.3242] for accurate
identification of the "magpies" reportedly affected by H5N1 in
Liaoning Province, China, at the beginning of November, we have
received the following response (truncated) from a bird researcher
and professional conservationist living and working in South Korea,
for which we are very grateful. - Mod.AS]

There are 3 species of magpie that are actually found in Liaoning
Province (the area of one outbreak in NE China).
1) The Eurasian Magpie _Pica pica_;
2) The Asian Azure-winged Magpie _Cyanopica cyanus_;
3) The Red-billed Blue Magpie _Urocissa erythrorhyncha_.
All 3 species are largely resident, though there might be some local
dispersal (esp. in autumn).
The Eurasian Magpie is an abundant bird, found around villages,
towns, anywhere with disturbed habitat. They are omnivores, and very
fond of scavenging around farms etc. Considered a lucky omen
generally, they are not often persecuted. It is also apparently the
only wild bird species that was found dead in South Korea after the
outbreak here (2003/2004), presumably after eating infected poultry
or waste.
Asian Azure-wingeds are rather more local, and again are often found
around villages and farms. They are also omnivores, but very often
feed largely on fruits and seeds (at least here in South Korea).
The Red-billed Blue Magpie is a common bird of "forest edge, scrub
and even villages" (Mackinnon and Phillipps, A Field Guide to the
Birds of China, OUP, 2000).
There are 4 broad categories that might help in the consideration of
spread (local or otherwise) among wild bird species. These are:
1) Domesticated/caged wild birds;
2) Scavenging species (e.g. Crows, Eurasian Magpies);
3) Species that often feed in polluted waterways near towns, farms,
sometimes also scavenging on dead animals (e.g. Grey Heron, Little
Egret, Chinese Pond Heron, Black-headed Gull etc);
4) Colonial nesters/flocking waterbirds (e.g. Bar-headed Goose, Great
Cormorant etc).
These categories might well produce a more useful tool for
considering infection in wild birds than by looking at the purely
species or genus-level.
