An outbreak of the devastating lethal yellowing disease is
threatening coconut palms across the island, spurring the Coconut
Industry Board (CIB) to recommend that all infected plants be
immediately cut down and burned. "We have seen hot spots all over the
island, but it is now showing up highly concentrated in the eastern
parishes," said Edgar Watson, general manager of the Coconut Industry
Board (CIB).

A resurgence of lethal yellowing could wipe out the island's coconut
palm population, killing an industry already under pressure from
substitute oils and synthetic products. Dr Wayne Myrie, plant
pathologist at the Board, suggested that the plant should ideally be
cut down at the 1st stage. "It is a culling procedure that is used
with many other commodities," Watson said. The CIB is also advocating
the use of legumes as cover crop, and special attention given to soil
fertility.

Problems with lethal yellowing go back more than 100 years in the
Caribbean. It was discovered in Cayman Islands in 1834 and 50 years
later showed up in the western end of Jamaica. The 1st major outbreak
occurred in 1961; the 1st case being in Buff Bay before afflicting
the major coconut growing parishes in the eastern end of the island.
More than 8 million palms were destroyed during that outbreak. Then
in the 1970s, research led to the introduction of the Malayan Dwarf
and later a local hybrid named Maypan, both of which were believed to
be resistant to the disease. However in 1988, palms including the
Malayan dwarf again displayed symptoms of the disease.

[2] Lethal yellowing, coconut palm - Jamaica: resistance breakdown research

In Jamaica, the Maypan, a hybrid of Malayan Yellow Dwarf (MYD) and
Panama Tall coconut previously considered highly resistant, is
currently being devastated by an epidemic outbreak of lethal yellowing disease.

There are several possible causes for this change. In this study, we
checked that affected planting material in Jamaica is genetically the
same as the material shown to be resistant. We compared the
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of MYD sampled in 4 locations in Jamaica
with a reference DNA of the same cultivar collected in 5 different
countries. The results of our analyses showed more variation at 34
simple sequence repeat loci in Jamaica than in the rest of the world,
providing clear evidence for the presence of about 16 percent of
alleles that do not match the usual typical MYD genotype.

These alleles appear to have already been present in the introduced
germplasm. This rules out a possible cause of the new outbreak: The
observed heterogeneity may have caused some loss of resistance but is
insufficient to explain a massive outbreak of the disease.

Lethal yellowing diseases have devastated coconut plantations in
tropical regions of Africa, causing severe economic hardship and
environmental damage. UK and African scientists are joining forces to
understand the disease and to develop new varieties of coconuts that
are able to resist infection. Coconut breeders have identified some
palm varieties which show resistance or tolerance to the diseases.
Researchers from the UK and Ghana want to study these coconuts and
exploit their resistance to produce improved varieties for future plantations.

International researchers are now joining forces to examine how
phytoplasmas are transmitted between coconuts and to look more
closely at the molecular and genetic basis of disease resistance and
tolerance in coconuts. This information will then be used in breeding
programmes and for replanting programmes to minimise the risk of
future coconut harvests being destroyed by disease.

[4] Kerala wilt, coconut palm - India: phytoplasma characterisation and vectors

Kerala wilt disease of coconut palm is a major threat of coconut
production in Kerala caused by phytoplasma. The genomic DNA purified
from the insect tissues of _Proutista moesta_ (PM) and _Stephanitis
typica_ (ST) was subjected to PCR [Polymerase Chain Reaction] assay.
The presence of a 650 basepair product from _P. moesta_ indicates the
vectoral ability of the insect. No sign of amplification was noticed
in the case of ST, suggesting the inability of this insect as vector.
The sequential similarity of the 650 bp of both KWD phytoplasma and
the insect phytoplasma supports the transmission of phytoplasma
through the vector PM.

Moreover, the sequence of 650 bp was compared with other sequences of
26 coconut phytoplasmas so far reported internationally, and a
cladogram was prepared for determining the phylogenetic status. It is
obvious from the cladogram that the KWD disease phytoplasma is
evolutionarily closest to the phytoplasma of coconut lethal yellowing
of Mexican palms within the group 16SrIV. Phylogenetically, KWD
phytoplasma is grouped in the new subgroup 16SrIV-C subsequent to the
groups 16SrIV-A and 16SrIV-B for Mexican coconut lethal yellowing and
Tanzanian coconut lethal decline, respectively.

This records the 1st finding of the vector of Kerala wilt disease by
detecting KWD phytoplasma in insect tissue of PM by PCR-based
methods. Moreover, the study reveals the phylogenetic status of KWD
phytoplasma compared to other coconut phytoplasmas internationally.

[Coconut palm is a vitally important subsistence and cash crop in
many poor regions, so much so that it is often called the "Tree of
Life". A number of phytoplasma diseases are known to affect this crop.

1. Lethal yellowing (LY) is caused by _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma palmae
and is spreading in the Americas and parts of Africa. It has
seriously jeopardised coconut industries in affected areas and can
infect a large number of palm species, killing trees usually within 4
to 6 months. Planthopper vectors, possible seed transmission, and
weed reservoirs are thought to be involved in LY epidemiology. For
more information on LY, see previous ProMED-mail post no. 20080125.0313.

2. Cape St Paul wilt (CSPW) disease in Ghana is caused by a related
phytoplasma of the palm lethal yellowing (16SrIV) taxonomic group. A
number of other LY group strains have been described from different
regions. The vectors for CSPW and some of the other LY phytoplasmas
are not known yet, but seed-transmission has been reported. For more
information on CSPW, see previous ProMED-mail post no. 20071224.4129.

3. In Asia, a number of coconut diseases caused by phytoplasmas are
known, for example Natuna and Kalimantan wilts in Indonesia, and
Kerala wilt (KW) in India. The KW phytoplasma was thought to belong
to a separate taxonomic group, but the above report [4] has now
placed it as a species within the lethal yellowing group. It is
spread by insect vectors, but there is no evidence of seed
transmission. The disease is not lethal, but significantly reduces
production. For more information on KW, see previous ProMED-mail post
no. 20080105.0063.

Symptoms of these phytoplasmas may be suppressed by regular
tetracycline applications, but commercial control is primarily being
achieved by replanting with resistant varieties. Recent observations
of breakdown of resistance to the LY phytoplasma of some widely used
hybrids are causing great concern for coconut replanting programmes
worldwide. Reasons for the breakdown are still uncertain and may
include genetic variation of either the host, the pathogen, or the vector.

The report [2] above seems to exclude genetic contamination of
Malayan Dwarf varieties as a sole source of resistance breakdown.
Similar work has been carried out by the same researchers to check
the genetic background of Panama Tall in Jamaica. Malayan Dwarf and
Panama Tall are the parents of the widely used "resistant" MAYPAN
hybrid. While some contamination primarily from the highly
susceptible Jamaican Tall was detected, this seemed insufficient to
be the only cause of the latest outbreak of the disease. Neither the
MAYPAN nor its parents can be considered resistant in the present
context of Jamaica (M. Dollet, personal communication).
