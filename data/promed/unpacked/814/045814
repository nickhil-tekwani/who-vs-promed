Over 4000 cases and 64 deaths have been recorded nationwide following the cholera outbreak that hit the country during the 1st quarter of 2012, according to available statistics. The Accra metropolis is said to be leading with 2756 cases and 31 deaths.

Dr Simpson Anim Boateng, public health director of the Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA) told Daily Guide on Wed Jun 2012 that, although 2012's figures are far lower than 2011, the fatality rates are unacceptable and called for rapid a response to reported cases and the tidying up public places.

Currently health officials in Accra have announced a significant decline in the outbreak but say with the onset of the rains, there are fears of possible fresh outbreaks unless residents continue to adhere to strict personal and environmental hygienic practices.

He said if the sanitation situation in the city returns to a deplorable state, it may trigger a massive outbreak of cholera and even other water borne diseases, attributing the decline to swift public response to the assembly's by-laws on hygiene.

A growing cholera outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo has claimed nearly 400 lives and affected more than 19 100 people since January 2012, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

"The total number of cholera cases in 2012 is around 90 per cent of cases reported in 2011. Since January 2011, 983 people have died from the outbreak affecting 8 of 11 provinces of the country," Yvon Edoumou, OCHA [UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs] spokesman, told a news conference.

Since the outbreak started, more than 40 795 cases have been reported. Edoumou said the growing epidemic had put a strain on ongoing humanitarian interventions funded mainly by a USD 9.1 million grant by the UN Central Emergency Response Fund, which provides rapid response grants for humanitarian emergencies.

[3] Cholera - Zimbabwe (Masvingo Province)

Government has declared the cholera outbreak reported in Chiredzi a national priority. This comes amid growing fears of a repeat of the 2008 epidemic, which killed over 4000 people countrywide. The director of Epidemiology and Disease Control in the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare, Dr Portia Manangazira, said a national response team was currently on the ground in Chiredzi.

"The permanent secretary urgently sent the national rapid response team and the provincial health executive of Masvingo to support the district health team on the ground since the outbreak has been declared a national priority.

"The outbreak has gone beyond the World Health Organisation benchmark of control due to the quality of water available to households, few functional toilets, and limited numbers of health workers to do both outbreak response and community health education," she said.

In 2011, 79 people died due to cholera and 28 due to malnutrition in Pune. These shocking facts came to light through a right to information (RTI) query.

RTI activist Vihar Durve filed the query and received its reply from PMC's [Pune Municipal Corporation] birth and death registration section, stating that a total of 25 049 people died within PMC limits in 2011. Of these, cholera, an infectious disease that is notifiable, claimed 79 lives, according to the RTI reply. These trends are seen in previous years too. The 2010 records show 24 deaths due to cholera, while the 2009 records peg cholera deaths alone at 468.
