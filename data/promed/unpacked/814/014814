Anthrax in humans hits Masvingo
-------------------------------------
An outbreak of anthrax in humans has hit Chivi and Gutu districts in
Masvingo, where over 70 cases of the disease have been reported to date,
amid fears that 2 people died of the disease in Chivi.
The anthrax scourge has also claimed a lot of cattle in the 2 districts,
raising suspicion that most of the affected people might have consumed meat
infected with the disease.
The acting Masvingo Provincial Medical Director, Dr. Charles Sandy,
yesterday [Wed 12 Jan 2005] confirmed the outbreak of the disease, saying
Chivi had been the hardest hit. "About 53 cases of anthrax have been
reported in humans in Chivi, and we have treated some infected people. We
cannot, however, confirm that 2 people died from anthrax in Chivi, because
they were buried before we could verify that anthrax caused their deaths.
In Gutu, about 20 cases of the disease have been reported to date, and we
are intensifying our efforts to contain the disease by carrying out
awareness campaigns in these districts," said Dr. Sandy. "The major
handicap in containing the anthrax outbreak in humans was the shortage of
anthrax vaccines in the veterinary department for cattle. We have enough
vaccines to treat people infected by anthrax, but the veterinary department
is experiencing an acute shortage of these vaccines for the inoculation of
cattle from where people contract the disease."
In September last year [2004], there was another outbreak of anthrax in
Bikita district's Ngorima, Mutikizizi and Devure 1 areas. Anthrax was also
reported in Gutu and Chivi districts, where it killed a lot of cattle.
The shortage of anthrax vaccines -- most of which are imported -- in the
veterinary department has resulted in the deaths of many cattle in
Masvingo, stifling the province's efforts to replenish its beef herd
decimated by drought more than a decade ago. The Department of Veterinary
Services yesterday [Wed 12 Jan 2005] said that they were currently facing a
shortage of anthrax vaccines. "We are not getting enough foreign currency
to procure anthrax vaccines; as a result, we haven't been able to import
adequate supplies of the drugs," said Dr. Welbourne Madzima.

[From this report, it is now clear that this disease is uncontrolled in
Zimbabwe. We can therefore only expect to see a significant increase in
livestock and human cases as the summer progresses in the Southern
Hemisphere. - Mod.MHJ]
