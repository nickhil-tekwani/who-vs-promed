Banana wilt hits staple crop
----------------------------
The livelihood of millions of Ugandan farmers has been threatened by a
bacterium that affects banana, a staple crop for food and employment. The
pathogen is _Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _musacearum_ (Xcm), which causes
bacterial wilt and has been linked to the recent decline in crop yields.
According to scientists, Xcm is gradually spreading in East Africa and if
unchecked could result in massive losses. Studies in Uganda show that the
disease attacks all varieties of banana, locally known as matooke, a staple
food in Uganda and parts of Kenya and Tanzania.
Banana production in Uganda has already dropped from the annual yields of
15 to 20 tonnes per acre in the 1970s to the present 6 tonnes per acre and
9.5 million per year. A report by the Association for Strengthening
Agricultural Research in Eastern and Central Africa (ASARECA) says the
disease was first reported in Ethiopia, but its impact there was minimal
because the country is not a major producer of the crop. In Uganda, the
disease was first noted in the major banana-producing districts of Mukono
and Kayunga districts in 2001. Farmers in Mukono district have uprooted and
burned their crop in an attempt to contain the disease.
Scientists warn that the disease is likely to spread more rapidly in the
districts with large banana plantations. Ninety per cent of the crop in the
country is produced by smallholders for domestic consumption and local trade.
According to ASARECA, little is known about Xcm, and because of this, it is
likely to cause havoc in East Africa. Its first symptoms are discoloration
of flower tips and withering of flower bracts. Other symptoms are yellowing
of the leaves, wilting, and premature flowering of young plants.
Xcm-infected plants die within a month of infection. Scientists say they do
not understand the mode of spread of the disease but they suggest that the
pathogen could be spread by air, insects, or surface run-off.
Bacterial wilt is the latest problem to affect banana production worldwide.
Other problems range from black sigatoka disease to loss of soil fertility
and a limited genetic pool from which to breed resistant varieties.
Scientists have recommended a long-term strategy that involves
understanding and developing resistant varieties as a means of control.
Ugandan bananas have become a major non-traditional export to Europe, the
Middle East, and neighboring countries such as Kenya.

[The disease first appeared in Ethiopia and emerged in Uganda in 2001. Xcm
also causes a wilt disease in Ensente, a variety of banana occurring in
Ethiopia. This is the third report of bacterial wilt of banana in Africa.
Edible bananas are normally seedless clones, which present problems in
banana improvement. Some breeders are suggesting that resistance to the
pathogen may depend upon genetic engineering of specific clones. - Mod.DH]
