Local media reported 3 deaths from a bacterial disease linked to filthy
water.
Three people died of leptospirosis, a disease transmitted to man by
animals, after bathing in an eastern Romanian river which local authorities
say was infested with carcasses and rats.
Independent news agency Mediafax said 32 others had been diagnosed with the
disease.

[The term leptospirosis covers a group of spirochaetal zoonoses with many
different presentations, which are often confused with meningitis,
encephalitis, and influenza. Many cases are asymptomatic, but liver and
kidney damage may be severe and fatal. These diseases occur worldwide,
often in workers who are exposed to livestock, wild animals, and water
exposed to animal urine. Most cases are male & middle-aged. Animal hosts
include: rats, pigs, wild boar, cattle, horses, mice, buffaloes, sheep,
shrews, foxes, hedgehogs, and dogs. (Source: Weekly Epidemiological Record,
