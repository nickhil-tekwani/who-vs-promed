[These data have been derived and compiled from 2 sources:
1. Table 11 (Situation countries/diseases) of EU's weekly report "Animal
Disease Notification System (ADNS)" for the period 1 Jan to 3 Dec 2004
<http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/animal/diseases/adns/adns_2004.pdf>
(Greece, though an EU member country, is not covered in this table).
2. OIE's BSE tables, updated 7 Dec 2004
<http://oie.int/eng/info/en_esbmonde.htm>
The cited figures are the ones reported by each country at the latest date
in either of the said 2 tables. During 2004, an increase in the number of
recorded BSE cases has been observed in the Czech Republic, Germany, Japan,
Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia. In other countries, a decrease is seen,
either as a continuing trend or (in Portugal; see further in item 2) as a
positive new development. - Mod.AS]

[2] Portugal: export restrictions lifted

BSE: formal lifting of restrictions on Portuguese exports
---------------------------------------------------------
The European Commission today [19 Nov 2004] adopted a Regulation lifting
the embargo on Portugal and removing all restrictions on the export of
cows, beef, and related animal products. The export embargo was adopted in
November 1998 because of the high rate of BSE in Portugal. Since then,
Portugal has taken firm risk management action, and the incidence of BSE
has consistently decreased. Therefore, the Commission in September 2004
proposed to the Member States to lift the embargo (See IP/04/1118). The
Regulation has today [19 Nov 2004] been formally adopted, will be published
in the Official Journal tomorrow [20 Nov 2004] and enters into force on 21
Nov 2004.

BSE cases at lowest level since recording started
-------------------------------------------------
BSE was identified in the UK in 1986. Since then, more than 183 000 cases
have been confirmed in the UK, over 95 per cent of which were detected
before 2000.
The epidemic peaked at an annual total of more than 37 000 clinical cases
in 1992, and the number of new clinical cases is now at the lowest level
since recording began.
There were 186 clinical cases detected through testing in 2003, and the
Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs [DEFRA] said it was
clear that there would be a further sharp reduction in 2004.
By 15 Nov 2004, there had been only 73 clinical cases detected this year,
the vast majority in cattle born before August 1996. [According to ADNS
statistics of 3 Dec 2004, 328 BSE cases have been reported from the UK
between 1 Jan and 16 Nov 2004. OIE's data as of 30 Sep 2004, mention 242
cases for the current year, compared to a total of 612 throughout 2003.
Clarification will be helpful. - Mod.AS].
Feed controls, which outlawed offal in cattle feed from August 1996, led to
a sharp fall in BSE cases in cattle born on or after that date.
DEFRA has set up a review in a bid to find out why 99 cattle, born after
the ban on offal in feed, had contracted the disease for no known reason.
It resurrects theories that cattle feed containing animal remains was not
the only source of the mysterious epidemic.

[4] Japan - SRM list

BSE's anomalous prion detected from peripheral nerve tissue and suprarenal
gland in dead cow
-----------------------------------------------
The National Institute of Animal Health announced on 1 Nov 2004 that it had
detected the anomalous prion protein that is the etiologic agent of BSE
from the peripheral nerve tissue and the suprarenal gland of the BSE
positive 94 month old cow that had died on 9 Mar 2004.
The removal of specified risk material, or SRM, such as the head, the
spinal cord, the vertebral column, and the small intestine, which are known
to accumulate the anomalous prion protein, is compulsory in Japan as a BSE
control measure. The reported detection of the BSE prion from a tissue
different from SRM prescribes the review of the listed specified risk
material by the Japanese Government.
[The statement of the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (only in
Japanese) is to be found at
<http://www.maff.go.jp/www/press/cont2/20041101press_7.htm>].

[The Committee for Proprietary Medical Products (CPMP) of the European
Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) established, in
2001, 4 BSE risk categories on the basis of examinations of cows and other
animals that became infected with similar diseases (for example, sheep
which contracted scrapie). These categories have been summarized in the
"Note for guidance on minimizing the risk of transmitting animal spongiform
encephalopathy agents via medicinal products," as follows:
Category I (very high infectivity): brain, spinal cord, eyes.
Category II (high infectivity): cerebrospinal liquid (liquor = brain and
spinal cord liquid), hypophysis (pituitary gland), ilium (lower part of the
small intestine), lymph nodes, tonsils, spleen, suprarenal gland, upper
part of the colon (proximal), dura mater ("hard" meninges), placenta,
pineal gland.
Category III (moderate infectivity): bone marrow, liver, lung, mucous
membrane of the nose, pancreas, peripheral nerves, thymus, lower part of
the colon (distal).
Category IV (no detectable infectivity): blood, mammary glands, ovaries,
feces, fetal tissue, uterus, coagulae, heart, testicles, milk, kidney,
seminal vesicle, thyroid gland, serum, skeleton muscles, saliva, salivary
glands, connective tissue, gall bladder, hair, skin, bones, cartilage
tissue, urine.
The said list is not similar to the SRM list that covers organs prohibited
from entering the food and feed chain. The latter have been selected while
considering their relative risk factor as food for man and animals, which
is related to quantitative aspects of their BSE-prion contents.
In an earlier posting this year (see 20040515.1316, [3] Japan - research),
it was reported that Japan's National Institute of Animal Health was about
to launch, in a new facility, research into the development of early BSE
detection techniques. Are the current findings related to the said
research? First hand information on the technique applied for the detection
of the BSE prion in peripheral nerve(s) and suprarenal gland of the
affected cow would be useful.
It will be also interesting to note whether results of controlled infection
trials in bovines within the UK-based BSE research project, "Experimental
production of bovine tissue for the validation of BSE diagnostic tests
(SE1736)", have been published or might become available. - Mod.AS]
