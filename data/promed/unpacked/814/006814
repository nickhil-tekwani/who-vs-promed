A total of 91 people became sick in a food poisoning outbreak at a hotel in
Hong Kong, according to case reports delivered to Hong Kong's Department of
Health. The patients, aged 6 to 80, developed diarrhea, nausea, abdominal
pain, and vomiting, after a buffet dinner on 7 Jul 2004, according to
government sources making statements on Sun 11 Jul 2004.
At least 19 people sought medical treatment and are now in stable
condition, while a 38-year-old man, who was admitted to Princess Margaret
Hospital, has been discharged. The Hong Kong Food and Environmental Hygiene
Department ordered the temporary closure of all of the 4 canteens at the hotel.
A spokesman from the Hygiene Department said that staff groups would be
sent everyday to monitor the situation at the Regal Riverside Hotel, where
the food poisoning outbreak happened, before the hygienic conditions there
would be cleared to allow the food outlets to resume operation.
The department has dispatched 2 groups of staff members to the hotel, in
plain clothes, to inspect the hygienic conditions of the kitchens of the
food outlets, and, the surrounding environment of the hotel. The Department
of Health will conduct further tests to determine the nature of the food
poisoning.

[Without a stated incubation period for the outbreak, it is difficult to
suggest an etiology. The stated absence of fever, however, does suggest a
toxin-induced disease caused by organisms such as _Staphylococcus aureus_,
_Clostridum perfringes_ or _Bacillus cereus_. - Mod.LL]
