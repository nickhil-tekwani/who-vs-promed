2nd South Carolina County, Barnwell, found to have Asian soybean rust
---------------------------------------------------------------------
South Carolina has confirmed soybean rust [ASR] in a sample taken 31 Aug
2005 from a field planted for potential use in insecticide trials at
Clemson University's Edisto Research and Education Center in Barnwell
County. Barnwell is 2 counties up from Hampton County, the site of the 1st
ASR found in the state this year. Soybeans in the 2-acre Barnwell field
were Maturity Group VI at growth stage R5-R6 with almost full-size seeds in
the pods. As such, they were the earliest-planted soybeans on the Center.
John Mueller, Extension soybean pathologist at Clemson, put this additional
information in his commentary yesterday in an e-mail co-written with David
Howle, assistant director of regulatory services at Clemson, to pathologist
colleagues yesterday: "The level of severity was higher than that observed
in the Hampton County rust field. Approximately 30 per cent of the
collected leaves had 1 or more ASR pustules on the bottom surface. Most of
the affected leaves had 5 to 15 pustules. This indicates that we may have
had spores produced by the initial pustules and we are seeing a second
generation of pustules now. It also means that infection probably took
place 10 to 14 days ago."
According to Mueller, the Hampton County field where ASR was observed on 15
Aug 2005 has been sprayed with a fungicide and he has taken several samples
since the 1st observation of ASR in that field. "Development of ASR is
apparently very slow, since it has been difficult to find pustules in any
of our samples from the Hampton County field. We have sampled numerous
other fields throughout South Carolina in the last 10 days without any
other ASR detections other than at the Edisto Center field."
According to Mueller, we are assuming that ASR is still not widespread and
is occurring primarily in more mature fields. ASR findings in Alabama,
Florida, Georgia and Mississippi as well as in South Carolina are primarily
in older soybeans, usually those in R4-R5 growth stage or later. As our
soybean crop matures, we should expect to see more finds of Asian soybean
rust, most likely in order from the southern to the northern part of the state.
"The levels of rust observed in this latest find, and our failure to find
rust in many other fields, indicates our levels of rust are low and we have
time to develop spray strategies for each of our fields. We do not need to
'rush out and spray,' but we do need to make good informed decisions on a
field-by-field basis."

[The following is an update of the USDA National Map Commentary (updated: 8
Sep 2005). Calhoun County in South Carolina and Washington County in
Georgia are the newest counties to report Asian soybean rust [ASR] in the
Gulf States. Oconee County in Georgia is the furthest northern location
where ASR has been found in 2005. Calhoun County in SC is the furthest east
that ASR has been detected while Pearl River County in Mississippi is the
furthest west that ASR has been reported in 2005. To date, Alabama has 13
counties reported positive with ASR; Florida has 22; Georgia has 15;
Mississippi has 2; and South Carolina has 3. There were 35 counties
reporting ASR in August with 4 reports so far in September. New reports of
ASR are expected to continue within states already reporting ASR and
adjacent states to the north. With the potential movement of spores by
Hurricane Katrina to the north, chances of deposition and infection
increase beyond states that already have reported ASR. Weather conditions
in the coming weeks will continue to drive ASR spread in the region.
