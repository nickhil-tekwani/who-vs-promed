The World Health Organization warned Thu [14 Feb 2019] that efforts to halt the spread of measles were "backsliding", with case numbers worldwide surging around 50 percent last year [2018].

The UN health agency pointed to preliminary data showing that the disturbing trend of resurgent measles cases was happening at a global level, including in wealthy nations where vaccination coverage has historically been high.

"Our data are showing that there is a substantial increase in measles cases. We're seeing this in all regions," Katherine O'Brien, WHO's director of immunisation, vaccines and biologicals, told reporters in Geneva.

"We're having outbreaks that are protracted, that are sizable and that are growing," she said. "This is not an isolated problem."

O'Brien pointed out that less than 10 percent of actual measles cases are reported.

"So when we see the reported cases increasing by 50 percent, we know that we're heading in the wrong direction," she said, adding that the true number of infections was "in the millions".

Countries have until April 2019 to report measles cases registered in 2018 to the WHO.

But the agency said the data it has received so far showed that around 229 000 cases had already been reported, compared to 170 000 for 2017.

Last year [2018], measles caused approximately 136 000 deaths around the world, according to WHO's preliminary figures.

This is frustrating since the disease can be easily prevented with 2 doses of a "safe and efficient" vaccine that has been in use since the 1960s, the UN agency said.

Up until 2016, the number of measles cases had been steadily declining, but since 2017 the number has soared, according to Katrina Kretsinger, who heads WHO's expanded immunisation programme.

"There are a number of outbreaks which are driving some of these increases," she told reporters, pointing to significant outbreaks in Ukraine, Madagascar, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Chad and Sierra Leone.

In poorer countries, marginalised communities and states in conflict, lacking access to the vaccine is the problem.

In Europe and other wealthy areas, meanwhile, experts blame the problem in part on complacency and misinformation about the vaccine.

The resurgence of the disease in some countries has been linked to medically baseless claims linking the measles vaccine to autism, which have been spread in part on social media by members of the so-called "anti-vax" movement.

"We're backsliding on the progress that has been made," O'Brien said.

"And we're not backsliding because we don't have the tools to prevent this. We do have the tools to prevent measles," she said. "We're backsliding because of the failure to vaccinate."

[2] Vaccine propaganda
Date: Thu 14 Feb 2019

https://www.newsweek.com/russian-trolls-promoted-anti-vaccination-propaganda-measles-outbreak-1332016


Russian propaganda may be responsible for the persistence of measles as conspiracy theories about vaccinations spread across the Internet, according to researchers.

Russian trolls were responsible for spreading propaganda against vaccinations. Their efforts may have helped cause the measles outbreak that infected tens of thousands and killed dozens in Europe last year [2018], researchers told Radio Free Europe.

A 2018 report by the American Public Health Association, titled "Weaponized Health Communication: Twitter Bots and Russian Trolls Amplify the Vaccine Debate," came to a similar conclusion.

"Whereas bots that spread malware and unsolicited content disseminated antivaccine messages, Russian trolls promoted discord. Accounts masquerading as legitimate users create false equivalency, eroding public consensus on vaccination," the report said.

"Health-related misconceptions, misinformation, and disinformation spread over social media, posing a threat to public health. Despite significant potential to enable dissemination of factual information, social media are frequently abused to spread harmful health content, including unverified and erroneous information about vaccines," it continued. "This potentially reduces vaccine uptake rates and increases the risks of global pandemics, especially among the most vulnerable."

Facebook is now looking for ways to combat disinformation about vaccines being spread on its platform.

The measles virus has resurged in recent years as conspiracy theories about vaccinations have spread online. Most of the new measles cases were in Eastern European and Central Asian countries frequently targeted by Russian disinformation, including Ukraine, Georgia, Serbia, Romania, Moldova, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.

Measles was considered eliminated in the U.S. in 2000 because of vaccines against measles, mumps, and rubella. Nevertheless, cases have increased in the U.S. Public health professionals have called the disease a leading cause of death among children.

The World Health Organization has said that fear of vaccines has become one of the top threats to global health as previously eradicated diseases make a comeback.

"Vaccine hesitancy -- the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines -- threatens to reverse progress made in tackling vaccine-preventable diseases. Vaccination is one of the most cost-effective ways of avoiding disease; it currently prevents 2-3 million deaths a year, and a further 1.5 million could be avoided if global coverage of vaccinations improved," a World Health Organization report reads. "Measles, for example, has seen a 30% increase in cases globally."

[The researchers to whom this report refers are never identified, so one cannot look into their work to evaluate the basis of their conclusions. It seems like there is enough anti-vaccine sentiment without needing Russian trolls, but the latter may further inflame individuals with the belief vaccines are dangerous and may sway those with doubts. Vaccine hesitancy, as it is called, is spreading and jeopardizing the health of children and even adults. Public health officers need to find new and creative ways to combat this misinformation.

See David A. Broniatowski et al. "Weaponized Health Communication: Twitter Bots and Russian Trolls Amplify the Vaccine Debate", Am J Public Health 108 (10) (1 Oct 2018): 1378-1384. DOI: 10.2105/AJPH.2018.304567.

"Objectives. To understand how Twitter bots and trolls ("bots") promote online health content.

Methods. We compared bots' to average users' rates of vaccine-relevant messages, which we collected online from July 2014 through September 2017. We estimated the likelihood that users were bots, comparing proportions of polarized and antivaccine tweets across user types. We conducted a content analysis of a Twitter hashtag associated with Russian troll activity.

Results. Compared with average users, Russian trolls (x2(1) = 102.0; P under .001), sophisticated bots (x2(1) = 28.6; P under .001), and "content polluters" (x2(1) = 7.0; P under .001) tweeted about vaccination at higher rates. Whereas content polluters posted more antivaccine content (x2(1) = 11.18; P under .001), Russian trolls amplified both sides. Unidentifiable accounts were more polarized (x2(1) = 12.1; P under .001) and antivaccine (x2(1) = 35.9; P under .001). Analysis of the Russian troll hashtag showed that its messages were more political and divisive.

Conclusions. Whereas bots that spread malware and unsolicited content disseminated antivaccine messages, Russian trolls promoted discord. Accounts masquerading as legitimate users create false equivalency, eroding public consensus on vaccination.

Public Health Implications. Directly confronting vaccine skeptics enables bots to legitimize the vaccine debate. More research is needed to determine how best to combat bot-driven content." - Mod.LK]

Facebook's advertising platform is being used to widely circulate anti-vaccine conspiracy theories and misinformation as the nation is attempting to control the resurgence of childhood illnesses that can easily be prevented through vaccinations.

PAY DIRT compiled data on 7 Facebook pages now running promoted anti-vaccine posts in the United States. Together, they have bought 147 ads on the platform, ads that have been viewed between 1.6 million and 5.2 million times. They overwhelmingly target women over the age of 25 -- about 72 percent of the people who viewed them were in that demographic -- the group most likely to include mothers of children who might need to be vaccinated.

Washington lawmakers are considering a bill today [15 Feb 2019] that would ban personal or philosophical exemptions to vaccinating school-age kids against measles, mumps, and rubella. The vote in the Washington House health committee today comes as the state grapples with a measles outbreak that has sickened dozens, many of whom were unvaccinated kids. The measure has scored the support of the state medical association and Gov. Jay Inslee. But it's been met with fierce opposition from anti-vaccine activists, hundreds of whom protested at a hearing last week.

On a related note: Anti-vaccine ads that spread misinformation are circulating widely on Facebook, and they're targeting women over 25 who might be moms to young children, the Daily Beast's Lachlan Markay reports. He analyzed data on 7 Facebook pages that post and promote anti-vaccine messages and found they've been viewed millions of times since late last year [2018].

https://bc.ctvnews.ca/we-now-have-an-outbreak-8-cases-of-measles-confirmed-in-vancouver-1.4299045


Vancouver health officials have identified 8 cases of measles in the city in recent weeks.

Speaking at a news conference Fri [15 Feb 2019] afternoon, Vancouver Coastal Health's Dr. Althea Hayden said it was determined that all cases are associated with a single school.

"We now have an outbreak," she said. Hayden said patients include staff, students and family members affiliated with Ecole Jules-Verne, a French-language secondary school.

"We have determined that measles was brought in to this community through travel outside of North America, and it is unrelated to the case that was reported earlier this month [February 2019] in a gentleman who had returned from the Philippines," Hayden said.

She said local health officials have been trying to notify those who may have been exposed to the highly contagious virus, but they have not been able to reach everyone.

Fortunately, most people in B.C. are immune to measles, and are unlikely to have gotten sick as a result of this exposure, but the virus does spread easily.

"My message today is clear. Get vaccinated. There's no excuse not to be vaccinated," B.C. Health Minister Adrian Dix said Friday [15 Feb 2019]. But he skirted the question of whether vaccines should be mandatory for students who attend public schools, the subject of a petition that has now surpassed 10 000 signatures.

The province's top doctor said she's not in favour of mandatory vaccines, but there is one change she would like to see.

"What I do think would be helpful for a variety of reasons is to have mandatory reporting of students' immunization status at entry to schools but also in daycares," Provincial Health Officer Bonnie Henry said in a phone interview.

"That's an opportunity for us to connect with them, with children whose immunizations are not up to date, to inform parents and to work with them." It's a model she said she's seen work in other parts of the country and around the world.

"That has been shown to be effective in bringing up immunization rates and then protection of all children," Henry said.

She said making immunizations themselves mandatory can provoke people who are anti-vaccine, but an opportunity for education has been valuable elsewhere.

[The health authority said there are 2 lab-confirmed cases of the highly contagious disease at Ecole Secondaire Jules-Verne and another at Ecole Anne-Hebert. Students and staff at the latter school may have been exposed to measles on 25 Jan 2019.

There is also a "suspected" case of the disease at Ecole Rose‐des‐vents that was discovered late Thu [14 Feb 2019].

VCH spokesperson Tiffany Akins said 2 of the schools are connected by a door, and all 3 share the same bus company.

Measles is back in the US because states make it too easy to avoid vaccines. The era of religious and moral vaccine exemptions needs to end, and fast.

As of Fri [15 Feb 2019], more than 270 people across the country, mostly small children, have been infected by the super contagious and sometimes deadly pathogen, measles, in ongoing outbreaks since last fall [2018].

In New York City, the virus has been spreading since September [2018] among Orthodox Jews, some of whom reject vaccines on behalf of their children because of unfounded safety concerns. In Washington state, mistrust of health officials and pharmaceutical companies appears to be driving parents to opt out, leading to 53 cases since 1 Jan 2019. (Nearly 1 in 4 kindergartners aren't vaccinated at the outbreak's epicenter, Clark County.) There are also cases in Texas, Oregon, western and southern New York State.

These outbreaks will cost states and the federal government millions of dollars to contain. They'll distract from other important public health programs. Most importantly, they'll put people who can't be immunized -- people allergic to vaccines, newborn babies -- at risk.

But here's the most frustrating part: This is all entirely avoidable. By 2000, thanks to the measles vaccine, the virus had been eliminated in the US. It's absurd that outbreaks have reappeared, yet there's a single reason why: Too many states make it way too easy for parents to avoid vaccines on behalf of their kids.

In other words, measles is making a comeback because of a policy failure.

In the US, before a vaccine was introduced in 1963, there were 4 million measles cases, with 48 000 hospitalizations and 500 deaths in the US every year. Measles was also a leading killer of children globally.

As soon as [measles] vaccination coverage drops below 95 percent," Seth Berkley, the head of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, warned in a recent CNN article, "outbreaks are inevitable." That means nearly everybody in a community who can get the vaccine needs to be accounted for to stop the virus from spreading.

The era of lax vaccine policies has to end.

The percentage of people seeking nonmedical exemptions -- while still small -- has also been creeping upward, from 1.1 percent in 2009-2010 to 2.2 percent by 2017-2018. Outbreaks in recent years have also been getting larger.

[This article is recommended reading, particularly for its discussion of the consequences when non-medical exemptions to vaccination are limited. It was shown in California that eliminating non-medical exemptions does not solve the problem, medical exemptions go up when non-medical go down, but the overall immunization rate does improve. Immunization rates in Mississippi and West Virginia -- the only other 2 US states [in addition to CA] that don't allow non-medical exemptions -- are always among the highest immunized in the nation and are not experiencing outbreaks of measles, mumps, rubella. - Mod.LK]

Health officials have issued measles warnings to anyone who shopped at a commercial complex here, particularly for Valentine's Day gifts, or used specific bullet trains connecting Osaka and Tokyo earlier this month [February 2019].

A public health center in Osaka said 14 Feb 2019 that a staff worker and 6 customers were infected with measles at the Abeno Harukas commercial complex, bringing to 16 the number of confirmed cases there.

Earlier this month [February 2019], 9 workers at a Valentine's Day fair venue on the 9th floor of the complex's wing tower were confirmed infected with measles. The latest announcement is the 1st to list customers.

The 6 customers are in their teens to 30s and visited the complex on 26 or 27 Jan 2019.

The latest staff member confirmed infected is a woman in her 30s who worked at the Valentine's Day venue between 5-10 Feb 2019.

The health center believes the measles outbreak came from the same source and is urging customers who visited the commercial complex and the Valentine's Day venue to check for symptoms, including high fevers and rashes.

Also, on 14 Feb 2019, the Osaka prefectural government said a woman in her 40s who traveled between Tokyo and Shin-Osaka stations on the Tokaido Shinkansen Line on 8 and 10 Feb 2019 was infected with measles.

The number of confirmed measles cases in Osaka Prefecture this year [2019] was 46 as of 12 Feb 2019, more than triple the figure for all of 2018.

https://reliefweb.int/report/philippines/philippines-measles-outbreak-flash-update-no-1


Measles cases are rising in the Philippines with the Department of Health (DOH) declaring outbreaks in 5 regions in the country, including in Metro Manila. The DOH reported over 4300 confirmed measles cases from 1 Jan-13 Feb 2019. Severe complications from measles have also claimed the lives of 70 people, one in 3 of which were children younger than 9 months old. According to the DOH surveillance data, more than 80 per cent of 2.6 million unvaccinated children are in the 7 regions which have declared outbreaks: Regions III, IVA, IVB, VI, VII, VIII, and the National Capital Region. In San Lazaro Hospital in Manila, 3 wards have been opened to accommodate the influx of patients from Metro Manila and neighbouring regions.

On 11 Feb 2019, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) requested its regional disaster offices to convene their respective response clusters to monitor possible outbreaks in their respective areas. Government agencies continue to respond, assisting with distributing vaccine, deploying medical personnel to promote awareness and providing immunization. The Department of Education is gathering data on measles cases and conducting evaluations in schools.

The DOH met with international health partners on 15 Feb 2019 to provide updates on the response to the outbreak. In attendance were OCHA, WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, IOM, Save the Children, Asian Development Bank, and a representative from the British Embassy. DOH already activated its Incident Command System to implement the nationwide vaccination campaign, which will target 95% of the estimated 2.6 million unvaccinated children under 5 years. Children 0 to 59 months old will also be provided with polio vaccine as the Philippines is on the watch list for possible disease outbreaks. DOH reported that it has in-country stockpiles of 5 million doses of measles vaccine. With the declaration of an outbreak, the agency was able to access its emergency response funds which allows it to procure, through UNICEF, one million vaccines expected to arrive in March. DOH has further requested UNICEF to facilitate the purchase of another 5 million vaccines which it expects to be delivered in 4-8 weeks.

Antipolo City in Rizal has recorded the highest number of measles cases in the region.

Forty people have died of measles in Calabarzon since the start of the year [2019], according to the regional office of the Department of Health (DOH).

From 1 Jan-14 Feb 2019, the Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit recorded 1645 measles cases with 40 deaths, compared to 66 cases and 2 deaths in the same period in 2018.

Antipolo City in Rizal recorded the highest number of measles cases in the region at 441, followed by Binan City in Laguna with 126 cases, Rodriguez and Taytay towns in Rizal with 105 and 95, respectively, and 91 cases in Lipa City, Batangas.

DOH-Calabarzon held another emergency response meeting on Thu 14 Feb 2019 [see report above], to address the rapidly increasing measles cases in the region that spans Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, and Quezon.

The meeting included provincial, city, and municipal health officers; National Immunization Program (NIP) coordinators; provincial health team officers; and development management officers of the region.

DOH Regional Director Eduardo Janairo outlined the latest directives and key strategies in the ongoing mass immunization against measles. "We will be implementing key strategies on measles outbreak response including surveillance, public awareness and education, vaccination and taking care of measles patients in health care facilities," Janairo said.

DOH will collaborate with the Department of Social Welfare and Development to ensure that students in DSWD day care centers are vaccinated, and with the Department of Education to ensure that all school children will get their dose of measles vaccine.

The Department of the Interior and Local Government will be asked to extend the immunization schedules beyond regular hours to implement a supplemental immunization activity from February to March 2019, while the World Health Organization is expected to help in developing a checklist for local government units, Janairo said.

He added that the Armed Forces of the Philippines will aid in the deployment and safety of medical personnel in geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas and conflict areas, while the Philippine National Police and the Bureau of Fire Prevention will provide additional personnel and logistical support.

He said private partners will be requested to assist in the awareness campaign and to augment vaccination teams.

DOH Calabarzon is targeting the vaccination of 430 292 children in the region from a projected population of almost 16 million. "With everything in place, we are expecting cases to decrease next month [March 2019]," Janairo said.

On 12 Feb 2019, DOH Calabarzon and the Binan city government deployed vaccination centers in fast food chains in strategic areas to mark the start of the mass immunization activity in the province.

Public health officials in France are reporting a measles outbreak in Val Thorens located in the town of Belleville, Savoie.

To date, 5 measles cases have been confirmed, and another 20 suspect cases are under investigation. The cases are primarily in young adults working at the winter sports resort.

In addition, the Scottish and Belgian health authorities reported 2 suspected cases of measles among residents upon return to their country who were at Meribel and Val Thorens, respectively.

Health authorities say the risk of more cases is favorable as the ski resort at Val Thorens is very busy, especially since the beginning of the French school holidays on 9 Feb 2019 and the presence of many foreign nationals, especially Dutch, British and Scandinavian.

In the past year, Public Health France reported 2652 cases from February 2018 to February 2019 to date. One quarter of the patients required hospitalization, and 3 deaths were recorded.

Officials note that 89% of measles cases occurred in unimmunized or poorly vaccinated patients.
