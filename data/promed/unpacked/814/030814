A total of 81 persons infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Saintpaul have been reported from 18 states. Since the last update, 8 new ill persons have been reported from Arizona (2), Minnesota (1), North Carolina (2), Ohio (2), and Virginia (1). This PFGE pattern has rarely been seen before in PulseNet and in the past typically caused 0-5 cases per year.

Among persons for whom information was available, illness onset dates range from 12 Jan 2013 to 19 Apr 2013. Ill persons range in age from less than 1 year to 89 years, with a median age of 27 years. 63 percent of ill persons are female. Among 56 persons with available information, 16 (29 percent) ill persons have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Preliminary epidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback investigations conducted by officials in local, state, and federal public health, agriculture, and regulatory agencies indicate that exposure to imported cucumbers supplied by Daniel Cardenas Izabal and Miracle Greenhouse of Culiacan, Mexico and distributed by Tricar Sales, Inc. of Rio Rico, Arizona is the likely source of this outbreak of _S._ Saintpaul infections.

In interviews, ill persons answered questions about foods eaten and other exposures during the week before becoming ill. 30 (67 percent) of 45 ill persons interviewed reported eating various types of cucumbers purchased or consumed at multiple locations or restaurants. This proportion is significantly higher than results from a survey of healthy persons in which 44 percent reported eating cucumbers in the 7 days before they were interviewed. An additional 5 (11 percent) of 45 ill persons reported that they may have eaten cucumbers. No other foods that were reported eaten by interviewees were associated with illness.

Reviewing shipping records, with assistance from its partner state agencies, FDA traced cucumbers eaten by 6 ill people to the distributer, Tricar Sales, Inc., and further, to the suppliers, Daniel Cardenas Izabal and Miracle Greenhouse. On 24 Apr 2013, the suppliers were placed on Import Alert. Cucumbers from these 2 firms will be denied admission into the USA unless the suppliers show that they are not contaminated.

The number of illnesses reported has declined substantially since a peak in early March 2013. Currently, there is no evidence that contaminated cucumbers are still on the market. However, due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported, additional ill persons may be identified. CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill persons and to interview ill persons about foods eaten with before becoming ill.
