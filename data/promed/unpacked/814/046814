A 25-year-old Egyptian woman died of bird flu on Sunday [30 Dec
2007], the 2nd fatality among humans in Egypt in less than one week,
the Health Ministry said. The woman died in hospital in the Nile
Delta city of Mansoura, 3 days after she was admitted to a smaller
local hospital with a high temperature and difficulty breathing, it
said in a statement carried by the state news agency MENA. Her death
was the 17th in Egypt since the deadly virus arrived in February
2006, and it was the 42nd case of bird flu reported among humans in
the Arab world's most populous country. The Health Ministry said that
the latest victim was suspected of handling sick domestic birds, the
usual way of contracting the virus in Egypt.

On Wednesday last week [19 Dec 2007], another 25-year-old woman died
of bird flu in Beni Suef province south of Cairo, the 1st case this
winter season. It is the 3rd winter that the virus has struck, after
appearing to remain dormant during the hot summers. The health
ministry said on Thursday [27 Dec 2007] that 2 other Egyptians had
contracted the disease and were receiving treatment. But the latest
death was not one of those, and one health official said those 2 were
still in hospital.

John Jabbour, an official at the World Health Organisation (WHO),
said last week that the new cases were not surprising.

[The statement that: "...the virus has struck [again], after
appearing to remain dormant during the hot summers," is misleading.
It is certainly true that in Egypt and elsewhere, the number of human
cases of H5N1 avian influenza has declined during the summer months
to increase again during winter months. The virus is never dormant,
however; rather, it is that the conditions for transmission of
infection are more favorable during the colder, damper months of the
year.
