... we have confirmed that humans, pigs, dogs, cats, horses,
goats and bats have been infected by the Nipah virus...
*****************************
Australian scientists are playing a key role in the international
effort to stop the deadly Malaysian Nipah virus, which has killed
scores of people and thousands of pigs. CSIRO Animal Health's
Dr Peter Daniels and Dr John White have just returned from
Malaysia, where they joined a team from the [US Atlanta-based
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in investigating
and controlling the outbreak.
Dr Peter Daniels is a veterinarian and project leader of CSIRO
Animal Health's Diagnosis and Epidemiology section. He has
been working with the Malaysian Department of Veterinary
Services in conducting animal post mortems, and collecting
blood samples from pigs and other animals for testing at the
Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) in Geelong.
"Through testing at AAHL we have confirmed that humans, pigs,
dogs, cats, horses, goats and bats have been infected by the
Nipah virus. This information is critical in assisting the Malaysian
veterinary services to successfully contain the virus and prevent
further deaths. We are also undertaking transmission experiments
with pigs to determine how they may be passing the virus to other
pigs, and to people. The unique biocontainment facilities at AAHL
make it one of the few places in the world where testing and
research of this sort can be safely carried out. While collecting
samples in affected areas in Malaysia, we wore
special breathing hoods to help minimise any risk of infection with
the disease. The Malaysian vets have now been equipped with
similar apparatus and trained in its use, and strict protocols
developed to ensure their safety while working on potentially
infected farms.

so I simply put there where they might belong. I apologize if I warped
any quotes. - Mod.CC
"The most important part of the work has been to apply this
early knowledge of the disease and how it is spread, to develop
control measures. We assisted the Malaysian Veterinary Services
Department in designing a national surveillance and eradication
program for the disease in livestock, based on the detection
and culling of infected pigs," Dr Daniels says.
Dr John White is a CSIRO Animal Health research scientist with
experience in developing diagnostic tests for viral diseases. Dr
White worked with staff from the Veterinary Research Institute
(VRI), in Ipoh, Malaysia to develop a blood test to show if pigs
have been exposed to the virus. "The test is now being used in
Malaysia to screen at least 30 000 pig blood samples from more
than 1000 pig farms nationwide, as part of the control strategy
for the Nipah virus. Pigs are also being randomly sampled at
Malaysian abbatoirs to ensure that potentially diseased animals
are not being submitted for human consumption," Dr White says.
Dr White will soon return to Malaysia to assist the staff at VRI to
develop screening tests for other animals known to be susceptible
to the Nipah virus.

[Once again there is the hint that pigs with antibody are being
culled because they have antibody. Someone sure must know
something I don't know.
John Mackenzie, one of the organizers of the up-coming (August
1999) International Congress for Virology, has arranged for a
special 'late breaker' session with several papers on Nipah virus
and other emerging viral diseases. - Mod.CC
