For anyone hoping to see light at the end of the COVID-19 tunnel over the next 3 -- 6 months, scientists have some bad news: Brace for more of what we've already been through.

Outbreaks will close schools and cancel classes. Vaccinated nursing home residents will face renewed fears of infection. Workers will weigh the danger of returning to the office as hospitals are overwhelmed, once again. Almost everyone will be either infected or vaccinated before the pandemic ends, experts agree. Maybe both. An unlucky few will contract the virus more than once. The race between the waves of transmission that lead to new variants and the battle to get the globe inoculated won't be over until the coronavirus has touched all of us.

"I see these continued surges occurring throughout the world," said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, and an adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden. "Then it will drop, potentially somewhat precipitously," he said. "And then I think we very easily could see another surge in the fall and winter" of this year [2021], he added.

With billions of people around the world yet to be vaccinated and little chance now of eliminating the virus, we can expect more outbreaks in classrooms, on public transport and in workplaces over the coming months, as economies push ahead with reopening. Even as immunization rates rise, there will always be people who are vulnerable to the virus: newborn babies, people who can't or won't get inoculated, and those who get vaccinated but suffer breakthrough infections as their protection levels ebb.

The next few months will be rough. One key danger is if a vaccine-resistant variant develops, although it is not the only risk ahead. In the coming months, Bloomberg will explore the pandemic's long-term impact on economies and markets, the pharmaceutical industry, travel and more. "We're going to see hills and valleys, at least for the next several years as we get more vaccine out. That's going to help. But the challenge is going to be: How big will the hills and valleys be, in terms of their distance?" Osterholm said. "We don't know. But I can just tell you, this is a coronavirus forest fire that will not stop until it finds all the human wood that it can burn."

COVID-19 compared to other pandemics
---------------------------------
The 5 well-documented influenza pandemics of the past 130 years offer some blueprint for how COVID might play out, according to Lone Simonsen, an epidemiologist and professor of population health sciences at Roskilde University in Denmark. She is an expert on the ebb and flow of such events. While the longest global flu outbreak lasted 5 years, they mostly consisted of 2 to 4 waves of infection over an average of 2 or 3 years, she said. COVID is already shaping up to be among the more severe pandemics, as its 2nd year concludes with the world in the middle of a 3rd wave -- and no end in sight.

It's possible that the virus known as SARS-CoV-2 won't follow the path set by the pandemics of the past. After all, it is a different, novel and potentially more transmissible pathogen. And with a death toll of more than 4.6 million people so far, it's already more than twice as deadly as any outbreak since the 1918 Spanish flu.

Despite brutal initial waves and relatively high vaccination rates, countries including the U.S., U.K., Russia and Israel are flirting with record numbers of cases. Immunization is helping to moderate incidences of severe cases and deaths, but surging infections mean the virus is reaching the young and others who remain unvaccinated, leading to rising rates of serious disease in those groups.

Nations where vaccination has been sparse -- including Malaysia, Mexico, Iran and Australia -- are in the midst of their biggest outbreaks yet, fueled by the contagious delta strain. With the virus still spreading out of control in vast swathes of the planet, another novel variant could quite feasibly emerge. History shows the commonly held belief that viruses automatically get milder over time -- to avoid completely wiping out their host population -- is wrong, according to Simonsen. Although new mutations aren't always more severe than their predecessors, "pandemics can in fact get more deadly during the pandemic period, as the virus is adapting to its new host," she said.

Early in the COVID outbreak, there was good reason to hope that vaccines would provide long-term protection, much like childhood shots that stop diseases such as polio.

Coronaviruses have a "proof-reading" mechanism that fixes the in-born errors caused when the virus replicates, reducing the likelihood of variants emerging when the virus is transmitted from one person to another.

The number of global cases has been so vast, however, that mutations are occurring anyway.

"With the pandemic, we have this enormous force of infection," said Kanta Subbarao, director of the WHO Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Melbourne. "That has counterbalanced the ability of the virus to proof-read."

As a result, COVID could be like the flu, requiring regular vaccine top-ups to remain effective as the virus evolves. Some researchers say SARS-CoV-2 is poised to become completely resistant to the 1st generation of vaccines. A study from Japan, which has yet to be published or peer-reviewed, suggests that potentially dangerous mutations in the delta variant are already being picked up in a global database used to track such developments. Reports of current strains breaking through vaccinations or triggering higher fatality rates have not held up to rigorous scrutiny thus far.

"This is a scenario we hope won't happen," Simonsen said. "My God, we would have to do it all again."

Other even grimmer possibilities for the coming months include the emergence of a novel influenza virus or another coronavirus making the leap from animals into humans.

"As long as there are animal reservoirs of coronavirus there is still the possibility that another zoonotic coronavirus could emerge in the future," Subbarao said. "There is that in the background, the risk of still dealing with this one when another one emerges."

How will COVID end?
-------------------
What seems clear is that the pandemic will not be over in 6 months. Experts generally agree that the current outbreak will be tamed once most people -- perhaps 90% to 95% of the global population -- have a degree of immunity thanks to immunization or previous infection.

The key element should be vaccination, they say. "Without vaccination, one is like a sitting duck, because the virus will spread widely and find most everybody this autumn and winter," said Simonsen. More than 5.66 billion doses of vaccine have been administered around the world, according to Bloomberg's vaccine tracker. But the success of rollouts in some regions, such as the European Union, North America and China, masks the failure in others. Most countries in Africa have only given enough vaccine to cover less than 5% of their populations with a 2-dose shot. India has administered enough to cover only about 26%.

The pandemic will end at different times in different places, just as previous outbreaks have, said Erica Charters, associate professor of the history of medicine at Oxford University and the coordinator of a project on how epidemics end. Governments will have to decide how much of the disease they are comfortable living with, she said.

Approaches vary. While some countries are still shooting for zero COVID cases, the world is unlikely to eradicate the virus completely. Nations like Denmark and Singapore, which have managed to keep cases relatively contained, are already moving toward a post-pandemic future with fewer safety restrictions. Others, such as the U.S. and U.K., are opening up even as infection numbers near records. Meanwhile, China, Hong Kong and New Zealand have vowed to keep vigilantly working to eliminate the virus locally. As a result, they are likely to be among the last places to leave behind the disruption wrought by walling out the pandemic.

"The end process is not going to be uniform," Charters said. The pandemic "is a biological phenomenon, but it's also a political and social phenomenon." "Even now we have different approaches to it." It's likely to be messy, leaving a lasting legacy for years to come. Until then, most of us will need to brace for many more months in the pandemic's grip.

"We have to approach it with our eyes wide open and with a great deal of humility," Osterholm said. "Anybody that thinks we're going to be over this in the next few days or a few months is sorely mistaken."

[A good perspective on the future living with COVID, questioning whether it will follow the pattern of influenza needing annual updates of the vaccine composition, or not. But it is increasingly clear the pandemic will not end this year, and different countries will reopen in different stages. The concern for emergence of new zoonotic viruses before the pandemic ends is real and should encourage countries to be vigilant. - Mod.LK]

[B] Vaccine protection against delta virus
Date: Sat 11 Sep 2021
Source: Al Jazeera [edited]
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/9/11/new-us-studies-show-COVID-vaccines-protect-from-serious-illness


The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has presented data showing unvaccinated people are 4-and-a-half times more likely to contract COVID-19 and 11 times more likely to die from it than those fully vaccinated.

In a White House COVID-19 briefing on [Fri 10 Sep 2021], CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said the data shows "vaccination works and will protect us from the severe complications of COVID-19".

The studies involved more than 600 000 COVID-19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths in 13 states, and large cities from April through mid-July [2021].

"Looking at cases over the past 2 months when the delta variant was the predominant variant circulating in this country, those who were unvaccinated were about 4-and-a-half times more likely to get COVID-19, over 10 times more likely to be hospitalised, and 11 times more likely to die from the disease," Walensky said.

While protection remained strong against delta, the study also confirmed an increase in milder COVID-19 infections among fully vaccinated people, which the authors said reflected "potential waning of vaccine-induced population immunity".

Two other US studies also found that COVID-19 vaccines offer strong protection against hospitalisation and death, even in the face of the highly transmissible delta variant, but vaccine protection appears to be waning among older people, especially among those 75 and older.

US data on hospitalisation from 9 states during the period when the delta variant was dominant also suggests that the Moderna vaccine was more effective at preventing hospitalisations among individuals of all ages than vaccines from Pfizer or Johnson & Johnson.

In that study of more than 32 000 visits to urgent care centres, emergency rooms and hospitals, Moderna's vaccine was 95% effective at preventing hospitalisation compared with 80% for Pfizer and 60% for J&J.

Another study looked specifically at the performance of mRNA vaccines - such as the shots from Pfizer and Moderna - in patients at 5 Veterans Affairs medical centres, a racially diverse group made up largely of older male patients with higher rates of underlying disease.

Of the more than 1000 COVID-19 hospitalisations in that study, researchers found that combined both vaccines were 86.8% effective against hospitalisation - even against the delta variant. But vaccine effectiveness fell to 79.8% among veterans 65 and older.

In the third study, which looked at medical encounters in 9 states, overall vaccine effectiveness remained high at 86% against hospitalisation and 82% against visits to the emergency room or an urgent care centre. However, vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation was "significantly lower" among adults aged 75 and older, falling to 76% - the first time a drop had been observed in this data set.

The data comes a day after US President Joe Biden unveiled a 6-step plan to combat the pandemic, which includes measures such as requiring some employers to impose vaccination mandates or mandatory testing, making available more over-the-counter at-home coronavirus tests and expanding the government's free testing programme.

"I don't know of any scientist out there in this field who doesn't think it makes considerable sense to do the 6 things I've suggested," Biden said on [Fri 10 Sep 2021] during a visit to a local school in Washington, DC.

"We've got to come together. And I think the vast majority -- look at the polling data -- the vast majority of the American people know we have to do these things. They're hard, but necessary. We're going to get them done," he said.

According to CDC figures, about 177.4 million Americans, or 53.4% of the total US population, have been fully vaccinated so far.

On average, more than 136 000 new cases are detected every day, according to the CDC, in a stark increase from earlier summer when infections had dropped significantly nationwide. More than 1000 people are dying every day from the disease.

- Israel is making preparations to ensure it has sufficient vaccine supply in case a 4th round of COVID-19 shots is needed, the country's top health official said on [Sun 12 Sep 2021].

- President Joe Biden will announce his next steps to boost the global vaccine supply before this year's United Nations General Assembly begins, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said. Republican governors said the vaccine mandates Biden announced last week will backfire and harden resistance to getting the shot.

- The U.K. will abandon plans to call for proof of vaccination to enter certain venues, and may soon drop mandatory testing for returning travelers as part of a further easing of coronavirus restrictions to be announced this week.

Key developments:
- Global Virus Tracker: Cases pass 224.5 million; deaths exceed 4.6 million
- Vaccine Tracker: More than 5.69 billion doses administered
- New York City schools reopen to a mixture of fear and relief
- Retired seniors in U.S. aren't covered by Biden's vaccine plan

[3] Biden's vaccine plan: retired seniors

President Joe Biden's new COVID-19 plan will mandate vaccines for 100 million working Americans, but one group was conspicuously absent from this week's announcement: senior citizens. They're also the most likely to be hospitalized with the virus or die of it -- by a wide margin.

Retired seniors have been far more accepting of vaccines than their working age counterparts. Their full vaccination rate is 82%, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Because they're susceptible to severe illness, even relatively few unvaccinated seniors means more deaths -- and more crowded hospitals -- than would occur in a larger pool of younger adults.

About 75 million people in the U.S. are 60 and older. Recently, about 5-fifths of the nation's COVID-19 deaths have occurred in that population.

Around the world, the fast-spreading delta variant has left unvaccinated seniors exposed. Compared with the U.K., the U.S .' under performance in vaccinating them is one reason it has endured about twice as many fatalities per capita in this surge.

Even before the pandemic, the elderly were largely out of the workforce -- and thus beyond the reach of job-related mandates. Millions more have retired since March 2020.

Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University, said legal options for mandating senior vaccinations are limited. Instead, he said, the government may have to rely on incentives or outreach.

"For the vast majority of unvaccinated seniors, the problem isn't skepticism or vaccine hesitancy," he said. "It's much more a question of access. The fact that they may be homebound, depressed or lonely means they may not be able to negotiate how to find a vaccine."

Younger seniors have a higher rate of vaccination than their older peers. Initially, the opposite was true, as governments sent inoculation teams into nursing homes and assisted-living facilities. Recently, the numbers have flipped, adding support to the idea that some elderly residents -- especially those outside structured-living arrangements -- are simply having trouble navigating the system.

[Vaccination of the elderly, even with 82% of the elderly vaccinated in the US, seems important because of the severity of illness this demographic group experiences once infected. The importance of vaccination of the elderly is reinforced by their presence in nursing homes and hospitals, where virus spread can be rapid. - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours, 12 countries including the USA (35 450), India (31 374), UK (28 992), Philippines (21 400), Turkey (21 352), Iran (20 219), Malaysia (19 198), Russia (18 554), Thailand (14 029), Mexico (12 511), Vietnam (12 026), and Brazil (10 615), have reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 5668 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 10 Sep 2021 to late 11 Sep 2021). There appears to be the customary weekend-related drop in the reported case numbers. A total of 48 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 24 of the 56 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 4 are from the South East Asia region, 5 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 12.4%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 10.3%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show 13.7% decrease in daily reported cases and 3.2% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported approx. 350 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 225.47 million cumulative reported cases and over 4.64 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
