Viet Nam: Commune Under Scrutiny Over Suspected Flu Epidemic
---------------------------------------------------
A Vietnamese commune where a 5-year-old boy tested positive [for
avian influenza virus infection] last week is under scrutiny after
local inhabitants reported a flu epidemic, doctors said. Health
authorities were investigating after a local newspaper said 200
people had flu symptoms at the Chau Hoa commune in central Quang Binh
province, 400 kilometers south of Hanoi. World Health Organisation
representative Hans Troedsson said the cases "needed to be rapidly
and thoroughly investigated. We have asked for an urgent meeting with
the Ministry of Health," he said. "We could send a team from abroad
at very short notice."
Pham Sinh Quyet, an official from the provincial health department,
said a local team was sent to the commune on Sat 19 Mar 2005. "The
(200-people) figure seems to be very exaggerated. We have discovered
very few sick people so far after examining 7 families," he said. "We
discovered only one suspected case and the patient was transferred
last night to a hospital in Hue, where we will get some samples to be
tested in Hanoi," he added.
The most recent avian influenza victim in Vietnam was a 5-year-old
from the same commune, who tested positive to the H5N1 virus last
week. His 13-year-old sister, who died in Quang Binh hospital on 9
Mar 2005, is also a serious suspected case, but she was immediately
buried by her family and could not be tested. "It is likely that she
died from avian influenza, but no one will ever be able to confirm
it, as no tests have ever been conducted," said an official from
Hanoi's National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology. The 2 were in
contact with sick poultry.
34 people including a Cambodian national have died of bird flu in
Vietnam since late 2003. Health officials have warned of a global
pandemic if the virus mutates so that it can be transmitted between
humans. 35 of its 64 provinces and cities have been hit by the virus
[so far in 2005].

[The previous reports from the Chau Hoa commune in central Quang Binh
province (see: Avian influenza, human - East Asia (53): Viet Nam
20050320.0813) described an extensive outbreak of an undiagnosed
respiratory infection in the general population. The accuracy of this
now seems to be in doubt. It is still being asserted that the death
of the elder sister of the H5N1 virus-infected 5-year-old boy may
have been due to avian influenza, although this was presumably not
suspected at the time, as no diagnostic samples were collected. The
evidence for avian influenza virus infection is not compelling, since
the death of the elder sister occurred prior to the illness of the
brother, and apparently a younger sister was left unscathed. - Mod.CP]
