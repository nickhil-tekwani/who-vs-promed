The Dominican Republic Ministry of Health confirmed the outbreak of the chikungunya virus in the island, noting that the majority of cases are in Nigua, which is within the province of San Cristobal. According to lab results from CDC [US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention], 767 people in the Dominican Republic have tested positive for the chikungunya virus, a mosquitoborne illness that has quickly made its way around the Caribbean in recent months.

Chikungunya causes fever and joint pain; while it's not typically fatal, symptoms can last for months in some cases. The World Health Organization initially reported virus transmission in Saint Martin during December of 2013. Up until recently, the Dominican Republic had avoided the outbreak.

According to the Dominican Ministry of Health, analysis of those taken ill and the virus's progression suggests that islanders were infected in mid-February [2014]. Medical samples taken from the Dominican population were sent to CDC's labs in Atlanta for testing, and the results only arrived back in the Dominican Republic last Thursday night [4 Apr 2014].

Among the 767 positively identified cases of chikungunya, 446 were among those living in open homes. Significantly, 1855 people live in those homes in the affected area, meaning that the numbers of those with the virus [infections] are likely to rise in coming weeks as health officials try to control its spread and emphasize ways to avoid mosquito bites. Generally, it takes between 3-7 days after infection for symptoms to arise.

Both Dominican and global health officials are urging caution in hopes of avoiding a wider outbreak of chikungunya [virus infections]. On Saturday [6 Apr 2014], politicians, including San Cristobal senator Tommy Galan, held a work day in Nigua to raise awareness of virus's dangers and garner public support in flushing mosquitoes out of the area. People who came out to help were put to work fumigating houses, streets and abandoned lots.

The Dominican minister of health, Freddy Hidalgo, spoke about the problem on Monday [7 Apr 2014], tying it to World Health Day. In a similar vein to Galan, Hidalgo emphasized that it would take a concerted effort on the part of the public to eradicate the virus. A possible outbreak is possible even if dengue and malaria have decreased over the past few decades. He expressed concern that the high incidence of open water or wells and open air houses in the Dominican Republic make mosquitoborne illnesses like chikungunya [fever] quick to spread, since the island has an ideal climate for mosquito reproduction. The Dominican Republic has had trouble with other diseases transmitted by mosquito, as well, such as dengue fever.

While CDC has only issued its lowest level travel alert for those considering going to the Dominican Republic, others are concerned that we're being too lackadaisical about preventing the spread of viruses like chikungunya. According to a report from the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, officials from the Pan American Health Organization feel that Caribbean countries in particular need to "step up their efforts to battle insectborne diseases." PAHO noted that, despite a decreasing incidence of illnesses such as dengue fever and malaria over the past few decades, a debilitating outbreak is still possible. In addition, given that the joint pain from chikungunya [virus infection] can last for months and, in some cases, result in permanent disability, it's not something to take lightly.

The health organization called on governments in the Caribbean to maintain or increase funding for "vector control programs," invest in clean water and waste management systems, and collaborate with other countries to devise solutions to the problem of mosquitoborne illnesses.

[Another published report published on 7 Apr 2014 in Listin Diario indicated that there are at least 800 cases of chikungunya virus infection. They are occurring in Nigua, Palenque, Villa Fundacion, Madre Vieja Sur, and Pueblo Nuevo, in San Cristobal province, and in different neighborhoods of Hina. Ironically, the San Cristobal health director, Manuel A Hilario, came down with symptoms of chikungunya virus infection 3 days ago (http://www.listindiario.com.do/la-republica/2014/4/7/317362/El-virus-de-la-chikungunya-se-expande-en-barrios-de-SC in Spanish).

The Dominican Republic College of Physicians were quoted in the 5 Apr 2014 edition of El Nacional stating that there are more than 8000 febrile cases due to chikungunya virus infection and there are between 100-200 new cases daily (http://elnacional.com.do/cmd-dice-hay-8-mil-casos-chikungunya/ in Spanish). This is 10 times more cases than have been reported elsewhere. The reason for this difference is not explained. No doubt, many suspected cases have not been laboratory confirmed.

There are now over 800 suspected cases and 81 confirmed cases of the dreaded chikungunya disease in Dominica, health officials have said. "To date information coming from the ministry of health in Dominica indicates that we have 81 positive cases and 871 suspected cases of chikungunya. And that was as of last week Friday [4 Apr 2014]," said chief environmental health officer, Anthony Scotland.

He made the remarks at an exhibition on Vector Control at the ground floor of the Government Headquarters on Wednesday [9 Apr 2014].

The ministry of health has developed a strategy called the Integrated Approach to Vector Control to manage mosquitoes, the main vector which spreads the disease. He also urged Dominicans to play their part in preventing the spread of vectorborne diseases, such as chikungunya and dengue [fevers]. "Individuals and communities are encouraged to work together to get rid, in their premises and communities, of containers which can contribute to mosquito breeding," he pointed out. Some of the examples given were old tires, cans, plastic containers, drums, barrels, and buckets. Scotland also urged the use of long sleeves and mosquito nets.

He said the ministry of health has teamed up with the National Pest and Termite Control, Environmental Health Department, the National Public Surveillance team, local authorities, Dominica Water and Sewage Co (DOWASCO), Public Works Department, Dominica Air and Sea Port Authority (DASPA), and Dominica Solid Waste Management Corporation (DSWMC), in efforts to combat vectors on the island.

Wednesday's [9 Apr 2014] exhibition displayed the life cycles of the mosquitoes, and ways that they can be destroyed, among others. The exhibition will soon be taken to other health districts, including Marigot, St Joseph, Portsmouth, La Plaine, Castle Bruce, and Grand Bay.

A drive to get rid of derelict vehicles, particularly in the Roseau Health District, will also be undertaken. Dengue and chikungunya [virus infections] are spread by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes.

[5] International Task Force
Date: Mon 7 Apr 2014

http://gvn.org/chikungunya-task-force/


The Global Virus Network (GVN) announced today [7 Apr 2014] the formation of the GVN Chikungunya Task Force, comprised of top virologists from around the world.

The GVN Chikungunya Task Force is composed of 16 virologists representing 9 countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, Sweden, Grenada, Estonia, South Africa, and Thailand. It is being led by Dr Scott Weaver of the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), Dr John K Fazakerley at the Pirbright Institute in the UK, and Dr Marc Lecuit at the Institut Pasteur in Paris. All of the participating members are affiliated with GVN Centers of Excellence. Much of the group's effort will focus on issues related to more rapid identification of infections, improved treatment options, and development of an effective vaccine.

"There is every expectation that chikungunya will continue its spread from the Caribbean into Central and South America, Mexico, and eventually the United States," said Global Virus Network's Chikungunya Task Force co-chair Dr Scott Weaver. "As we gear up to address chikungunya in the Americas, we have much to learn from other countries where the virus has been endemic for many years. And, this new global collaboration will help all countries, particularly as we prepare for vaccine trials."

Chikungunya [disease] was 1st described following an outbreak in southern Tanzania in 1952. Since then the virus has been identified in dozens of countries across Asia, Europe, Africa, and now the Americas.

"The GVN Chikungunya Task Force will help speed the process to creating vaccines and much-needed diagnostic tools," said Global Virus Network's president Dr Sharon Hrynkow. "We look forward to working with public health agencies, including the Pan American Health Organization, to prevent the spread of chikungunya and mitigate human suffering."

[The formation of this task force and the identification of specific goals is some good news that comes out of this otherwise worrisome spread of chikungunya virus in the Caribbean. However, at the present time there are no measures available that can halt the further spread of the virus in the Americas, as Scott Weaver pointed out. - Mod.TY]
