Epidemiological Surveillance of the Fernandopolis Secretariat of Health received this Mon 26 Dec 2016 confirmation of the 1st case of yellow fever in a monkey this year. The animal was found dead in an urban area of the city on 8 Dec [2016].

The monkey was located between Asilo São Vicente de Paulo and salão Recanto do Tamburi and was sent for laboratory testing at the Instituto Adolfo Lutz.

On Tue 27 Dec 2016, the city initiated a vaccination campaign against the disease. Residents of the region where the animal was found were receiving visits by nurses in their homes, but those who were not found there must seek out a health unit in their neighborhood.

The health center has a special schedule for services this Tuesday and Wednesday, 27 and 28 Dec [2016], until 21:00 hours (9:00 PM) for evaluation of the vaccination certificates of the population.

According to Epidemiological Surveillance, everyone must pay attention to the signs and symptoms of yellow fever, which are: high fevers, chills, severe headache, myalgia (muscle pain), fatigue, nausea and vomiting during nearly 3 days and icterus (yellow color). Whoever presents with any of these symptoms must obtain medical attention immediately.

This is the 1st case of the disease in animals registered in the municipality. Up to the present, there have been no human cases registered.

Everyone in the population must take their vaccination card for updating to the health unit nearest their home.

In case a dead monkey is found, Epidemiological Surveillance needs to be notified immediately by telephone.

[Cases of yellow fever (YF) keep popping up in monkeys in various localities in Sao Paulo state this year (2016). The report of the dead monkey indicates that there is sylvan (forest) yellow fever (YF) virus circulating in another locality in São Paulo state. Other than the single human case cited earlier, there have been no reported human cases.

Despite these YF infected monkeys indicating that sylvan (forest) transmission is occurring, the risk of spill-over into the human population is real. Timely immunization of humans in these areas is prudent and is an effective measure to prevent initiation of an urban transmission cycle with many human cases. The comments of Mod.RNA in 2 previous reports of the Sao Paulo state sylvan cases of yellow fever are instructive.

A 1 Dec 2016 report posted in ProMED-PORT (in Portuguese) indicated that the dead monkeys were howlers, a species commonly involved in the sylvan cycle of YF virus transmission, and indicators of the presence of virus in the area.
