Health officials in the Ogden, Utah, area put out a warning after a
group of young girls at a campground were apparently sickened earlier
in August 2011 by bacteria in the water.

Authorities say water at the Shawnee and Ben Lomond campgrounds in
Weber County's North Fork Canyon tested positive for chloroform and
_E. coli_ bacteria. They say the bacteria is likely why 11 members of
girls' camping trip got sick after staying at Shawnee Campground
between 2-5 Aug 2011.

Officials are asking campers to bring their own supply of water to use
for drinking, cooking, and personal hygiene. Scientists from the
Weber-Morgan Health Department say they are working to disinfect the
water supply and will be testing the water until the bacteria are
gone.

[It is difficult to assess from this posting and others in the media
what the etiology (or etiologies) of the gastroenteritis outbreak is
(or are). It is not specifically stated that the _E. coli_ was an
enterohemorrhagic pathotype such as O157:H7 or any of the other
pathotypes such as enteropathogenic, enterotoxigenic,
enteroaggregative, enteroinvasive, or diffusely adherent _E. coli_.

Indeed, the finding of _E. coli_ in the potable water only suggests
that there is fecal contamination of the water, not that the organism
is the cause of the illnesses. As can be seen in the previous
ProMED-mail postings listed below, a variety of organisms, including
viral, bacterial, and protozoal, can be associated with waterborne
illness. - Mod.LL]
