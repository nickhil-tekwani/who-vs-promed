Findings of West Nile virus reported from 1 Jan through 22 Aug 2001
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Equine cases
There have been 35 confirmed clinical cases of West Nile virus (WNV)
infection detected in horses. The most recent states to report equine cases
are Georgia (Brooks County [previously reported as Thomas County) and
Pennsylvania (Bucks County). The other 33 cases are in horses from 8
counties in northern Florida: Clay (Middleburg, 1), Duval (Jacksonville,
1), Jefferson (Greenville, 2; Monticello, 13; unknown, 1), Leon
(Tallahassee, 2), Madison (Greenville, 3; Perry, 1), Nassau (Callahan, 1),
Suwannee (Live Oak, 1), and Taylor (Greenville, 1; Perry, 4; Shady Grove,
2). Twelve (34 per cent) of the 35 horses died or were euthanatized. All 35
horses were positive on IgM-capture enzyme linked immunosorbent assay
(MAC-ELISA) and a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) performed on
serum samples at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in
Ames, Iowa. The only 3 horses from which brain tissues were available also
tested positive at the NVSL on reverse transcriptase-nested polymerase
chain reaction (RT-nPCR) performed on those tissues.
Human cases
There have been 6 confirmed human cases of WNV illness, including one
fatality. A 71 year old woman from Atlanta, Georgia was the first person to
die from WNV infection this year and the first human case ever in that
state. Human illness has been confirmed in 3 states this year: Florida,
Georgia, and New York.
Wild Birds
There have been 1006 birds reported as positive for WNV in 15 states plus
the District of Columbia. New Jersey has reported the largest number of
positive birds (341). Six states have reported WNV positive birds for the
first time ever: Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, and Ohio.
Sentinel birds
Six sentinel birds have been reported as WNV positive. The most recent 2
were reported from Bay and Leon counties in Florida. The antibody positive
Bay County chicken was the first evidence of WNV detected in that county.
The first evidence of WNV activity in Duval County, Florida, was also
detected in a sentinel chicken earlier this summer.
Mosquito pools
A total of 243 mosquito pools have been reported as WNV positive from 5
States (Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island). New
Jersey has reported the largest number of positive pools (135). Overall,
the species found include _Aedes vexans_, _Anopheles punctipennis_,
_Anopheles quadrimaculatus_, _Coquillettidia perturbans_, _Culex pipiens_,
_Culex restuans_, _Culex salinarius_, _Ochlerotatus canadensis_,
_Ochlerotatus cantator_,and _Ochlerotatus japonicus_.
