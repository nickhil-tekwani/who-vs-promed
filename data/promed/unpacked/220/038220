Scrapie in Romania (Disease never reported before)
---------------------------------------------
Emergency report
Information received on 24 Dec 2002 from Dr Viorel Andronie, Director
General, National Sanitary Veterinary Agency, Ministry of Agriculture, Food
and Forests, Bucharest:
Report date: 24 Dec 2002.
Cases of scrapie were diagnosed in the following districts: Ialomita and
Calarasi (both in the south-eastern part of the country), and Iasi (in the
north-eastern part of the country).

[The first reporting of scrapie from Romania, a country that previously was
declared free of the disease, unfortunately does not specify the number of
cases (at least 3), clinical manifestation -- if observed, age, breed(s),
size of flocks, their husbandry, the diagnostic method(s) applied, and the
diagnostic laboratory involved. It may be speculated that the diagnosis of
the disease is related to the TSE testing programme of sheep and goats over
18 months of age required by the EU from member countries since 2002. This
programme, operational in most EU member-states since April 2002, includes
random testing of healthy animals at slaughter and of fallen stock on farms.
It has already led to the first detection of "goat TSE" in Finland and might
be instrumental in the detection of first scrapie or "small-ruminant TSE"
cases in other countries, including the ones -- in addition to Romania --
that are currently in the process being integrated into the EU.
The background of the new EU requirements is the (theoretical) risk of BSE
infecting sheep and goats, with their potential of becoming a public health
hazard. The currently applied tests, however, do not differentiate between
scrapie and BSE.
Romania, an exporting country with a sheep population exceeding 9 million,
is the 11th country to join the list of countries reporting first cases of
scrapie -- or , according to the EU, "small-ruminant TSE" -- during the
last 25 years. - Mod.AS]
