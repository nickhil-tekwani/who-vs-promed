It's the Hamptons' [Suffolk County, Long Island, New York] dirty little secret: dozens of children and adults are being diagnosed with Lyme disease each day as officials mount a campaign to battle ticks. The problem has gotten so bad that Southampton Hospital launched the Tick-Borne Disease Resource Center to help residents bugging out over the tiny blood-suckers.

One physician, Dr Blake Kerr, told The Post he treats 100 patients a week for Lyme disease. "It's an epidemic," said Kerr, who runs Wainscott Walk-In Medical Center and last summer contracted Lyme and 2 other tick-borne illnesses simultaneously. Pediatrician Dr Nadia Persheff of Hampton Pediatrics in Southampton sees as many as 4 children a day for Lyme disease and 20 for tick bites -- including one 3-week-old baby who came in with 4 ticks on his back. "You have to check every kid and every baby," Persheff said. "We're much busier than last summer. I've never seen it like this."

Suffolk County was ground zero for Lyme disease in 2012, leading the state [New York State] with 689 reported cases, data show. In 2013, the number of reported cases dropped to 566, according to state data.

Still, locals believe the ticks -- and tick-related illnesses -- are growing every year. The culprits are often deer ticks, which carry Lyme or malaria-like diseases such as babesiosis and -- at the size of a poppy seed -- are much smaller than common wood ticks.

Lyme disease, a bacterial illness with symptoms of skin rash, headache, and fatigue can cause neurological damage and other serious problems if left untreated. Early treatment typically includes a single dose of antibiotics.

Brian Kelly, owner of East End Tick and Mosquito Control, said he has fielded frantic calls from out-of-towners who want him to remove ticks from their bodies. "People are realizing they're everywhere -- you can't even go to the beach without getting a tick," Kelly said.

[In the USA, the prevalence of _Borrelia burgdorferi_-infected _Ixodes scapularis_ ticks, the vector of Lyme disease, commonly ranges between 20 and 40 percent in New England, the Mid-Atlantic States, and Minnesota and Wisconsin, where Lyme disease is endemic (Wormser GP, Dattwyler RJ, Shapiro ED, et al: The clinical assessment, treatment, and prevention of Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and babesiosis: clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Clin Infect Dis. (2006) 43(9): 1089-134. doi: 10.1086/508667. Available at http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/9/1089.full).

However, at sites in Westchester and Suffolk Counties in New York State (one of the Mid-Atlantic states), over 50 percent prevalence of _I. scapularis_ ticks have been found to be infected with _B. burgdorferi_, and over 20 percent of _B. burgdorferi_-infected ticks were either co-infected with _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ (the cause of human granulocytic anaplasmosis or HGA) or _Babesia microti_ (the cause of babesiosis); a lower percentage was co-infected with _Borrelia miyamotoi_ (the cause of a relapsing-fever like illness) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2883481/).

In regions where the local rate of _B. burgdorferi_ infection in _Ixodes_ ticks is at least 20 percent, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommends chemoprophylaxis with a single dose of antibiotic after a tick bite, if (a) the attached tick can be reliably identified as an adult or nymphal _I. scapularis_ tick that is estimated to have been attached for 36 hours or longer on the basis of the degree of engorgement of the tick with blood or of certainty about the time of exposure to the tick, (b) prophylaxis can be started within 72 hours of the time that the tick was removed, and (c) there is not contraindication for the antibiotic. Chemoprophylaxis can consist of a single dose of doxycycline for adults (200 mg dose) and children at least 8 years of age (4 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 200 mg) after a recognized tick bite (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/9/1089.full).

Treatment of adult patients with early localized or early disseminated Lyme disease associated with erythema migrans, in the absence of specific neurologic manifestations or advanced atrioventricular heart block, is doxycycline (100 mg twice per day), amoxicillin (500 mg 3 times per day), or cefuroxime axetil (500 mg twice per day) for 14 days (range, 10-21 days for doxycycline and 14-21 days for amoxicillin or cefuroxime axetil) (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/9/1089.full). Doxycycline has the advantage of being effective for treatment of HGA (but not for babesiosis), which may occur simultaneously with early Lyme disease. Doxycycline is relatively contraindicated during pregnancy or lactation and in children less than 8 years of age. Antibiotics recommended for children are amoxicillin (50 mg/kg per day in 3 divided doses [maximum of 500 mg per dose]), cefuroxime axetil (30 mg/kg per day in 2 divided doses [maximum of 500 mg per dose]), or, if the patient is 8 years of age or older, doxycycline (4 mg/kg per day in 2 divided doses [maximum of 100 mg per dose]) (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/9/1089.full).
