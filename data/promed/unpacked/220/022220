_Salmonella_ outbreak linked to tahini and halva from Syria expands in Europe
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
More sick people and _Salmonella_ serotypes are part of an outbreak in Europe linked to tahini and halva from Syria. More than 120 people have now been affected since 2019 in Germany, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands with at least 5 types of _Salmonella_ linked to the outbreak. Officials have provided Food Safety News with an update several months on from the outbreak being revealed. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) also plan to publish an assessment on the multicountry outbreak of multiple _Salmonella_ serotypes soon.

Based on epidemiological information and WGS [whole genome sequence] analyses, experts from the Robert Koch Institut (RKI) in Germany believe patients with the _Salmonella_ serotypes (also called serovars) Mbandaka, Havana, Orion, Amsterdam, and Senftenberg to be part of the outbreak. There are 72 patients in Germany as of late September 2021. A dozen are _S._ Mbandaka, 36 are _S._ Havana, 12 are _Salmonella_ Orion, 5 are _S._ Amsterdam; 1 patient is co-infected with __S._ Mbandaka and Amsterdam; and 6 have infections from _S._ Senftenberg sequence type 14.The age of patients ranges from less than 1 to 69 years old and 51 percent are male. Reported illness onset dates began in January 2019 and also affected people in 2020. RKI [Robert Koch Institute] initially noted an increase in _Salmonella_ Havana in 2019 but were unable to identify the source of infection. Those patients have been retrospectively linked to the current outbreak based on results from whole genome sequencing.

Since July 2019, 36 people have fallen ill with several different types of _Salmonella_ in Sweden after eating sesame-based products from Syria. The most recent illness was in September 2021. The sick people live in 12 regions. Patients are aged 0 to 88 years old with a median age of 30. 13 are children younger than 5. 20 men and 16 women have been sickened. Whole genome sequencing has been used to link cases with each other and with isolates of _Salmonella_ identified in food. A dozen people have been infected with both _Salmonella_ Havana and _S._ Mbandaka, 7 with _S._ Kintambo, 4 had _S._ Orion, and 1 with _S._ Senftenberg.

Testing on tahini and halva purchased in Sweden has found _S._ Havana, _S._ Mbandaka, and _S._ Orion, which can be linked to infections. Additional _S._ types have also been detected. Officials believe products were sold in smaller specialty stores in Sweden. Patients with _S._ Kintambo and _S._ Senftenberg can be linked to findings in products of tahini and halva sampled in Germany and Norway.

Norway has 2 patients with _S._ Mbandaka who reported eating sesame seed products. They are 5 and 45 years old, both are female but are from different regions of the country. Sampling dates of the isolates were March 2020 and June 2021. There are also now 2 patients with _S._ Orion and 1 with _S._ Havana infections associated with the outbreak. In July 2021, sesame seed-based products Al Burj Tahina and Al Burj Halwa were recalled in Norway. 4 RASFF [Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed] alerts have been posted for _Salmonella_ in sesame products from Syria since June 2021.

Denmark has logged 9 cases from February 2019 to July 2021. 3 females and 6 males aged 0 to 86 years old were sick. The serotypes include 3 each for _S._ Mbandaka and _S._ Havana and 1 each for _S._ Kintambo, _S._ Orion, and _S._ Amsterdam.

The Netherlands has identified 1 matching _S._ Mbandaka case and 1 _S._ Orion patient based on whole genome sequencing. 1 of those sick was a young child with the sample taken in March 2021.

[Tahini is a paste made from raw sesame seeds. Other products made from sesame seeds include hummus (together with chickpeas) and halvah.

Previous outbreaks of salmonellosis have been associated with food products produced from sesame seeds. In a previous ProMED posting (Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 - Australia, Europe 20010822.1980), between 1985 and 2001, the National Enteric Pathogen Surveillance Scheme (NEPSS) in Australia had recorded the isolation of 17 different _Salmonella_ spp. from sesame seeds and sesame seed products, including hummus, tahini, and halvah, on 30 occasions.

Sesame seed products should always be considered when attempting to identify a source of salmonellosis. - Mod.LL
