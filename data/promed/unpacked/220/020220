Fungal disease infects wheat crop in lower areas of Himachal
------------------------------------------------------------
Wheat crop in large areas in the lower hills of Himachal Pradesh have
been severely infected by a fungal disease, chief minister Prem Kumar
Dhumal told the Assembly. "Yellow rust has hit the wheat crop and its
acute effect had been seen in more than 16 941 hectares [about 42 000
acres]," he said.

"The disease also severely affected the wheat crop in the northern
states of Punjab [ProMED-mail post 20110211.0469], Haryana, and Uttar
Pradesh," Dhumal said.

A congress member said that 60 per cent of wheat crop has been
damaged in the state [of Himachal Pradesh] and blamed the government
for supplying substandard seeds.

Yellow rust destroys wheat crop in northern India
-------------------------------------------------
A wheat disease called yellow rust has destroyed about 60 per cent of
wheat plantations in Kathua, located in India's northern Jammu and
Kashmir state.

Farmers are worried about the situation, as most of them cannot
afford pesticides. They say the government should be of more
assistance. More than 24 000 acres [about 9700 ha] of wheat are
affected by yellow rust, and farmers are facing huge losses.

However, the district agriculture department says it is taking steps
to control the situation. The officials blamed heavy, unseasonal rains
for the disease.

Yellow rust spreads west
------------------------
Yellow rust is now attacking winter wheat crops in both the east and
west of the country, says Syngenta.

The disease has been present in some crops since a least early
February [2011], according to a yellow rust monitoring service being
run on the Syngenta website at
http://www.syngenta-crop.co.uk/rust-by-region.aspx.

Until recently it seemed mainly confined to eastern counties and the
south Midlands. Now the disease has been identified as far west as
Shropshire and Herefordshire.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the
fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. The disease affects
wheat, some barley varieties, triticale, and a number of wild grasses.
It causes yellow leaf stripes and stunting of plants with yield losses
of 40 to 100 per cent.

Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping
season, and the fungus survives on living host plants generating a
"green bridge" between seasons. Disease management includes the use of
resistant varieties, fungicide applications, and control of volunteer
crops.

New stripe rust strains with increased virulence are emerging
worldwide. Monitoring and resistance breeding programmes have been
established in different wheat growing regions.

In India, the emergence of a new strain was confirmed in Punjab and
Himachal Pradesh in 2009, and a change of wheat cultivars was
recommended to farmers (ProMED-mail post 20090329.1216). In the UK,
the Claire strain was recently reported for the 1st time (ProMED-mail
post 20110304.0705), and this strain is now considered a threat to
Europe.
