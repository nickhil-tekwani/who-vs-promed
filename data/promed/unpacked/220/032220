Florida bee keepers are wondering what the future holds. The reason is bees are dying by the millions, and that could spell higher food prices.

"The honey bee population in Florida is really in a crisis," said Dave Hackenberg from Trilby, in Pasco County. His business is renting bee hives to farmers so the bees can pollinate crops. But for the last 10 years, the bee population has dwindled, and Hurricane Irma didn't help. "Irma probably took out 75 000 to 80 000 hives of bees. Just from flooding, wind and ancillary damage," said Hackenberg.

Lee Rosen, CEO of Healthy Bees from Miami Beach, makes a supplement for sick bees. He believes the product, called BeesVita, could save the bee population. Bees eat it and, according to Rosen, become stronger.

Hackenberg said the solution to the declining bee population is additional research to find out what is killing them off, and how to stop it, because the food supply depends on it.

[A syndrome known as colony collapse disorder and other diseases are causing bee population declines in many parts of the world.

Mounting evidence indicates that bee colony collapses are caused by interacting stress factors that affect the balance between pathogens and host immunity. It has been shown that otherwise silent infections with "Deformed wing virus" become uncontrollable and kill the bees when accompanied by infection with the mite _Varroa destructor_. Other studies implicated pesticides interacting with cold (other stressors). It is likely that many factors, mostly anthropogenic stressors interacting in synergy, disrupt the health of bees and make them less capable of resisting infections. - Mod.PMB
