[In response to ProMED-mail post on 26 Oct 2003 -- see refs. -- on malaria in
Liberia and moderators' comments]
Bed nets in malaria contol
--------------------------
In my earlier comments on malaria vectors in Liberia, ProMED post of 24 Oct
2003, I was not suggesting that insecticide-impregnated bed nets should be
used instead of chemoprophylaxis to protect individuals against contracting
malaria, but that they are a useful adjunct to drugs. I have never considered
that such nets are the panacea for malaria control.
For example, they will provide relatively little protection in many South
American countries where malaria vectors are biting early in the evenings,
before many adults have gone to bed. And I acknowledge that resistance has
developed in sub-Saharan Africa in _Anopheles gambiae_ to permethrin and
deltamethrin, which could prove a problem in the future. But in sub-Saharan
Africa where the principal malaria vectors bite mainly from 2200-0400 hr,
they afford considerable protection against anopheline biting, and
incidentally even more protection for children who tend to be in bed earlier.
I agree that data analyses have shown that in Asia and Africa such nets
reduce clinical attacks of malaria by an average of 50 percent, but the
degree of protection will vary both geographically and seasonally.
Nevertheless, vector control, mainly now by insecticide-treated bed nets,
forms a major component of WHO's strategy to reduce malaria transmission.
In summary I believe that in addition to chemoprophylaxis, especially as
there is often poor compliance, pyrethroid-treated bed nets can have an
important role in protecting military personnel, and others, from malaria.
Furthermore, sleeping under such nets will greatly reduce biting by _Culex
quinquefasciatus_, which is a vector of bancroftian filariasis (_Wuchereria
bancrofti_) and mosquito vectors of a few arboviruses such as o'nyong-nyong
[transmitted by _Anopheles gambiae_ & +An. funestus_]. Finally, insecticide-
impregnated mosquito nets (but not untreated ones) will prevent biting by
phlebotomine sand-flies, the vectors of various forms of leishmaniasis.
