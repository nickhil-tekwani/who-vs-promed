Summary
------
What is already known about this topic?
Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare but severe condition that has been reported approximately 2-4 weeks after the onset of COVID-19 in children and adolescents.

What is added by this report?
Most cases of MIS-C have features of shock, with cardiac involvement, gastrointestinal symptoms, and significantly elevated markers of inflammation, with positive laboratory test results for SARS-CoV-2. Of the 565 patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing, all had a positive test result by RT-PCR or serology.

What are the implications for public health practice?
Distinguishing MIS-C from other severe infectious or inflammatory conditions poses a challenge to clinicians caring for children and adolescents. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to expand in many jurisdictions, healthcare provider awareness of MIS-C will facilitate early recognition, early diagnosis, and prompt treatment.

In April 2020, during the peak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Europe, a cluster of children with hyperinflammatory shock with features similar to Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome was reported in England (https://bit.ly/30FvjXs) (1). The patients' signs and symptoms were temporally associated with COVID-19 but presumed to have developed 2-4 weeks after acute COVID-19; all children had serologic evidence of infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (1). The clinical signs and symptoms present in this 1st cluster included fever, rash, conjunctivitis, peripheral edema, gastrointestinal symptoms, shock, and elevated markers of inflammation and cardiac damage (1). As of 29 Jul 2020, a total of 570 US MIS-C patients who met the case definition had been reported to the CDC. A total of 203 (35.6%) of the patients had a clinical course consistent with previously published MIS-C reports, characterized predominantly by shock, cardiac dysfunction, abdominal pain, and markedly elevated inflammatory markers, and almost all had positive SARS-CoV-2 test results. The remaining 367 (64.4%) of MIS-C patients had manifestations that appeared to overlap with acute COVID-19 (2-4), had a less severe clinical course, or had features of Kawasaki disease (Kawasaki disease is an acute febrile illness of unknown cause, primarily affecting children, and associated with fever, rash, conjunctivitis, redness in the mouth, cracked lips, and swollen lymph nodes, feet, and hands). Median duration of hospitalization was 6 days; 364 patients (63.9%) required care in an intensive care unit (ICU), and 10 patients (1.8%) died. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to expand in many jurisdictions, clinicians should be aware of the signs and symptoms of MIS-C and report suspected cases to their state or local health departments; analysis of reported cases can enhance understanding of MIS-C and improve characterization of the illness for early detection and treatment.

As of 29 Jul 2020, a total of 570 MIS-C patients with onset dates from 2 Mar 2020 to 18 Jul 2020 had been reported from 40 state health departments, the District of Columbia, and New York City (Figure). The median patient age was 8 years (range, 2 weeks to 20 years); 55.4% were male, 40.5% were Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic), 33.1% were non-Hispanic black (black), and 13.2% non-Hispanic white (white) (Table 1). Obesity was the most commonly reported underlying medical condition, occurring in 30.5% of Hispanic, 27.5% of black, and 6.6% of white MIS-C patients.

Overall, the illness in 490 (86.0%) patients involved 4 or more organ systems. Approximately two-thirds did not have preexisting underlying medical conditions before MIS-C onset. The most common signs and symptoms reported during illness course were abdominal pain (61.9%), vomiting (61.8%), skin rash (55.3%), diarrhea (53.2%), hypotension (49.5%), and conjunctival injection (48.4%). Most patients had gastrointestinal (90.9%), cardiovascular (86.5%), or dermatologic or mucocutaneous (70.9%) involvement. Substantial numbers of MIS-C patients had severe complications, including cardiac dysfunction (40.6%), shock (35.4%), myocarditis (22.8%), coronary artery dilatation or aneurysm (18.6%), and acute kidney injury (18.4%). The majority of patients (63.9%) were admitted to an ICU. The median length of ICU stay was 5 days (interquartile range, 3-7 days).

Of the 565 (99.1%) patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing, all had a positive test result by RT-PCR or serology; 46.1% had only serologic evidence of infection and 25.8% had only positive RT-PCR test results. Five patients (0.9%) did not have testing performed but had an epidemiologic link as indicated in the MIS-C case definition.

Among all 570 patients, 527 (92.5%) were treated, including 424 (80.5%) who received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), 331 (62.8%) who received steroids, 309 (58.6%) who received antiplatelet medication, 233 (44.2%) who received anticoagulation medication, and 221 (41.9%) who were treated with vasoactive medication. Ten (1.8%) patients were reported to have died (Table 1).

Latent class analysis (LCA) identified 3 classes of patients, each of which had significantly different illness manifestations related to some of the key indicator variables. Class 1 represented 203 (35.6%) patients who had the highest number of involved organ systems. Within this group, 99 (48.8%) had involvement of 6 or more organ systems; those most commonly affected were cardiovascular (100.0%) and gastrointestinal (97.5%). Compared with the other classes, patients in class 1 had significantly higher prevalences of abdominal pain, shock, myocarditis, lymphopenia, markedly elevated C-reactive protein (produced in the liver in response to inflammation), ferritin (an acute-phase reactant), troponin (a protein whose presence in the blood indicates possible cardiac damage), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), or proBNP (indicative of heart failure) (p less than 0.01) (Tables 1 and 2). Almost all class 1 patients (98.0%) had positive SARS-CoV-2 serology test results with or without positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results. These cases closely resembled MIS-C without overlap with acute COVID-19 or Kawasaki disease.

Class 2 included 169 (29.6%) patients; among those in this group, 129 (76.3%) had respiratory system involvement. These patients were significantly more likely to have cough, shortness of breath, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), indicating that their illnesses might have been primarily acute COVID-19 or a combination of acute COVID-19 and MIS-C. The rate of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positivity (without seropositivity) in this group (84.0%) was significantly higher than that for class 1 (0.5%) or class 3 (2.0%) patients (p less than 0.01). The case fatality rate among class 2 patients was the highest (5.3%) among all 3 classes (p less than 0.01).

Class 3 included 198 (34.7%) patients; the median age of children in this group (6 years) was younger than that of the class 1 patients (9 years) or class 2 patients (10 years) (p less than 0.01) (Table 1). Class 3 patients also had the highest prevalence of rash (62.6%), and mucocutaneous lesions (44.9%). Although not statistically significant (p = 0.49), the prevalence of coronary artery aneurysm and dilatations (18.2%) was higher than that in class 2 patients (15.8%), but lower than that in class 1 patients (21.1%). Class 3 patients more commonly met criteria for complete Kawasaki disease (6.6%) compared with class 1 (4.9%) and class 2 (3.0%) patients (p = 0.30), and had the lowest prevalence of underlying medical conditions, organ system involvement, complications (e.g., shock, myocarditis), and markers of inflammation and cardiac damage. Among class 3 patients, 63.1% had positive SARS-CoV-2 serology only and 33.8% had both serologic confirmation and positive RT-PCR results.

Discussion
----------
Hispanic and black patients accounted for the largest proportion (73.6%) of reported MIS-C patients. Acute COVID-19 has been reported to disproportionately affect Hispanics and blacks (10). Long-standing inequities in the social determinants of health, such as housing, economic instability, insurance status, and work circumstances of patients and their family members, have systematically placed social, racial, and ethnic minority populations at higher risk for COVID-19 and more severe illness, possibly including MIS-C.

Ten children have been treated in Ireland for illnesses similar to the mysterious Kawasaki disease which has been linked to COVID-19. The cases are revealed in a briefing document prepared for the new Health Minister Stephen Donnelly. They say that Children's Health Ireland (CHI) have advised the department that its hospitals have cared for 10 children who presented with features compatible with the description of the Kawasaki-like syndrome. All 10 children have recovered.

The briefing notes there "has been public discussion and reports of a Kawasaki-like syndrome in children linked to COVID-19 infections known as PIMS-TS Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome." The briefing says the cause of Kawasaki disease is unknown and there is no diagnostic test, but effective treatment is available. "CHI reports that it would expect to see about 10-15 cases/year throughout the island of Ireland," it adds.

The officials say the vast majority of children "recover spontaneously and completely." They say "many centres worldwide have reported on an increase in a Kawasaki-like syndrome in children and many of these cases have been associated with symptoms of a COVID-like illness." There have been 2 fatalities -- one in the UK and one in France.

In June [2020] there were reports that COVID-19 could be a trigger for the rare syndrome. A test developed by experts in Birmingham offered evidence confirming COVID-19 infection in cases of a newly emerged multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children who had previously tested negative for the virus.

[Cases have now been reported from multiple countries -- in many instances it has been a case of "seek and ye shall find." One caution in interpreting the age distributions is that in the USA, the case definition includes "An individual aged less than 21 years presenting with...."

[2] USA (Alaska): seafood plant
Date: Thu 6 Aug 2020
Source: Anchorage Daily News [edited]
https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/2020/08/06/seafood-plant-on-kodiak-island-reports-dozens-of-coronavirus-infections/


Yet another Alaska seafood processing plant has reported an outbreak of COVID-19, this time in a remote part of Kodiak Island. OBI Seafoods announced 37 cases at its plant in Alitak, in the southern part of the island. The workers who tested positive are being moved to Anchorage for isolation, the company said in a statement Thursday [6 Aug 2020].

"Because of the remote location of the plant and out of an abundance of caution, positive cases are being transported to Anchorage via safe transport where they will remain in isolation and in the care of our medical team," the statement said. An employee who was showing symptoms initially tested positive [28 Jul 2020], according to the company.

Employees who tested positive were isolated on the company's property. Other employees who may have been in contact with those who tested positive were tested and quarantined, and the plant was closed temporarily for cleaning, the company said. Some of the employees are symptomatic, according to information officers at the Kodiak Island Borough's emergency operations center.

The Alitak plant is closed to visitors, and employees aren't allowed to leave, said Meagan Christiansen, public information officer with the operations center. The plant is "completely isolated and operates as a closed campus," OBI said, so employees and community members do not interact.

The Alitak outbreak follows several large outbreaks in the Alaska seafood industry. An OBI processing plant in Seward saw 139 of 252 employees test positive, while an American Seafoods factory trawler had 85 of 119 workers onboard test positive, including one who was hospitalized. Workers from the OBI plant in Seward and the American Seafoods vessel were taken to Anchorage for isolation and quarantine.

There was also an outbreak among 76 of 135 workers at an Anchorage-based processor as well as one in Juneau, where 62 of 150 workers tested positive. OBI Seafoods said it is working with state and local health officials "to identify further quarantine recommendations, adopt aggressive testing schedules, initiate contact tracing, and identify any potential risks to employees." According to the company's testing plan, employees need to have negative COVID-19 test results before coming to Alaska and must quarantine for 2 weeks upon arrival. Employees go through a temperature check and symptom screening before going into work each day.

There are 42 active cases of COVID-19 in the Kodiak Island Borough, with 58 total cases confirmed there, according to a release from the Kodiak Area Emergency Services Organization.

A total of 46 new cases of COVID-19 were reported Thursday [6 Aug 2020] in Alaska as total active cases neared 3000, including 6 in nonresidents. Four new hospitalizations were reported, for a total of 34 confirmed COVID-19 patients currently being treated in hospitals across the state. There were no new deaths reported by the state's coronavirus dashboard.

Of the 2978 active cases of COVID-19 currently in Alaska, 2415 are Alaska residents and 563 nonresidents. Since March [2020], 1220 people have recovered from the virus.

Nearly half of the new cases reported Thursday [6 Aug 2020] were in Anchorage, which has continued to see high rates of community transmission. The municipality reported 25 total new cases: 24 in Anchorage and one in Eagle River. Six Fairbanks residents also tested positive for the virus, along with 2 from Soldotna, one each from Wasilla and North Pole, and 2 in Juneau. Two residents from smaller communities in the Northwest Arctic Borough tested positive, along with one in the Valdez-Cordova census area. The state does not name communities with fewer than 1000 people due to privacy concerns.

The new cases at the Kodiak Island plant did not appear to show up in statewide COVID-19 data on Thursday [6 Aug 2020]. Of the 6 cases in nonresidents reported Thursday, 4 were in Juneau and 2 were in Seward.

Alaska reported a test positive rate over the last 7 days of 3.05%, a number that has remained relatively low but has slowly been ticking upward in recent weeks. The average turnaround time for COVID-19 tests processed at state labs in the last 2 weeks is currently at 3.1 days, according to the dashboard.

[Seafood processing plants have been identified as an industry with high risk of transmission, owing to the indoor nature of the work in relatively confined spaces with difficulties in adherence to social distancing. The above outbreak is just another example of the risks in industries providing food for consumption, along with meat-packing plants and packing of vegetables and fruits from harvesting. - Mod.MPP]

Two people returning from Mexico and 3 that had either visited Da Nang or contacted infected cases there have been diagnosed with COVID-19. Of the 3 domestic cases is a Hanoi man residing in Hoai Duc District. Tagged "patient 785," he visited Da Nang with his family from 16-20 Jul 2020. He started coughing on 3 Aug 2020. He was admitted to Hanoi's National Hospital for Tropical Diseases 3 days later and was confirmed infected the next day [7 Aug 2020].

The remaining 2, numbered [786] and 787, are residents in central Quang Ngai Province, which stands nearby Da Nang. Both are family members of previous infected cases and had come into close contact with them. They are diagnosed with COVID-19 when in isolation. Two imported cases are patients 788 and 789. On Wednesday [5 Aug 2020], they entered Vietnam from Mexico via a special flight that transited in Japan. Upon entry, they were quarantined at a military facility in Khanh Hoa Province, home to the resort town of Nha Trang. Their tests turned out positive on Thursday [6 Aug 2020].

The new additions have raised Vietnam's COVID-19 tally to 789, including 384 active cases. A total of 10 patients have died and the rest have all recovered. Since 25 Jul 2020 when locally transmitted cases returned to Vietnam after more than 3 months, 333 of such cases have been added, spreading in 13 cities and provinces, including Hanoi and HCMC [Ho Chi Minh City]. All are linked to the epicenter Da Nang.

[These countries had been selected based on having had significant surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences. Spain has been added again, as it is dealing with a 2nd wave after lifting of restrictions, primarily focused in Catalonia and Aragon. - Mod.MPP]

https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200807-covid-19-sitrep-200.pdf?sfvrsn=2799bc0f_2


*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 7 Aug 2020.

Highlights
----------
- As the continent nears one million cases, WHO is increasing COVID-19 support to hotspot countries in Africa. Altogether more than 40 public health experts are expected to provide surge support, working with national and provincial counterparts on key areas of the response. The Pan-American Health Organization/WHO Regional Office for the Americas has drawn upon the Strategic Fund for Public Health Supplies to procure and distribute millions of COVID-19 diagnostic kits, personal protective equipment (PPE), and other essential health supplies to countries throughout the region. Thus far, over 10 million PCR diagnostic tests have been sent to 6 countries. The Strategic Fund also helped finance PPE, including face shields, gloves, goggles, gowns, masks and respirators, for 26 countries in the region.

- Environmental surveillance by testing of waste water for evidence of pathogens has a long history of use in public health. WHO has published a scientific brief on how this form of surveillance is being used in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

- Developing a vaccine against COVID-19 is one of the most pressing challenges of our time. WHO has published 2 new documents on the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility. One outlines global procurement for COVID-19 vaccines and the other focuses on [ensuring] accelerated vaccine development and manufacturing.

- Today's "Subject in Focus" provides a summary of the 4th meeting of the IHR Emergency Committee for COVID-19. The Committee noted the anticipated lengthy duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the importance of sustained community, national, regional, and global response efforts.

- The Americas region reported 55.4% of the global newly reported cases and 67.5% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 10.1 million cases. Brazil reported 37.1% of cases (57 152), followed by the USA 34.6% (53 373), Colombia 7.0% (10 735), Peru 5.0% (7734), Argentina 4.6% (7147), Mexico 4.0% (6139), and Chile 1.3% (1948).

- The European region reported 9.2% of the global newly reported cases and 6.1% of the newly confirmed deaths globally. Russia reported 20.6% (5241) of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by Spain 16.0% (4088), Israel 6.6% (1685), France 6.0% (1520), Ukraine 5.7% (1453), Romania 5.2% (1345), Turkey 4.5% (1153), Kazakhstan 0% (0), Germany 4.5% (1147), the UK 3.7% (950), Uzbekistan 2.9% (740), Poland 2.9% (726) and Kyrgyzstan 2.0% (503).

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.1% of the global newly reported cases and 7.0% of global newly reported fatalities. Iraq reported 24.5% (3047) of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran 21.2% (2634), Saudi Arabia 11.3% (1402), Morocco 9.2% (1144), Pakistan 6.3% (782), Kuwait 5.0% (620), Palestinian Authority 3.6% (453), Oman 3.4% (427), Libya 3.3% (404), and Lebanon 2.1% (255). Cases are increasing in Iraq and Morocco. This region remains highly active, with multiple countries still in a surge mode.

- The African region reported 4.5% of the global newly reported cases and 5.9% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 66.7% (8307) of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Algeria 4.6% (571), Ghana 4.6% (567), Ethiopia 4.5% (564), Kenya 4.3% (538), Nigeria 2.8% (354), and Madagascar 2.4% (304). While South Africa is the dominant country in the region, it has halved its daily case count in the past few days.

- The Western Pacific region reported 2.1% of the global newly reported cases and 0.72% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 58.3% (3480) of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 26.0% (1552), Australia 7.0% (418), Singapore 5.0% (301), China 2.2% (133), Viet Nam 0.55% (33), and South Korea 0.33% (20). Japan and Australia continue to increase in transmission.

- The South East Asia region reported 24.4% of the global newly reported cases and 14.7% of global deaths. India reported 92.2% (62 538) of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 4.4% (2977), and Indonesia 2.8% (1882). India continues to be the driving force of the dominance of this region.

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific region representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions. While regional proportions may not reflect this, most of the regions have countries that have resurgences of cases associated with lifting of restrictions.

[Comparing today's numbers with yesterday's (6 Aug 2020), the global case count rose by 1.5% in the past 24 hours. The USA and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts, although India continues to be rapidly increasing.

In the past 24 hours, the USA reported 63 345 cases, followed by India (61 455) and Brazil (49 502). These 3 countries account for half of all confirmed cases globally (51.9%). There were 6406 deaths reported in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, the USA is number one for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by India, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Argentina, South Africa, Spain, Mexico, and Russia. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases goes from 5241 to 63 345. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: Iraq, Philippines, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Iran, France, Chile, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and Japan; their range of reported new cases is 1552 to 3461.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is a decrease of 1.5%, and looking at daily reported deaths, the change is increased by 2.2%. The key question remains as to whether transmission is in fact slowing down or is this a reporting artifact? Time will tell, but following the data reports showing major surges in countries that had been showing successes makes one wonder what is driving these reporting variances (I haven't changed my mind!).

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality, while the global 7-day averages seem to reflect a slowing down of reporting confirmed cases, albeit I wonder if this is real or reflects a changing pattern with decreased testing. For example, the USA reported data suggests a slowing down of transmission over the past 2 weeks as seen by the comparative 7-day averages in reported new cases and deaths (see section [4E] above), but if one looks at the percentage of positive PCR tests, in the past 2 weeks the positivity rate is 9%, consistent with significant ongoing transmission that is not abating (see https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html.) The most severely affected region is the Americas with cases increasing daily, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). - Mod.MPP]
