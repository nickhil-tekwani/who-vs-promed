Smith Valley has the 1st case in Nevada of tularemia transmitted from
a cat to a human in 50 years. A woman took her sick cat to the vet;
it was misdiagnosed with kidney problems and sent home with
medication. The woman gave the pet its pills using her finger to
force them down its throat; little did she know that a small cut on
her finger would be the avenue for which tularemia would enter her
body.

The patient is now recovering after a harrowing month. The tularemia
infected her finger, which became painful and inflamed, then she
started running a high fever, she went to the emergency room on
several separate occasions where she was given antibiotics, which
seemed to calm the symptoms for several days and then the whole thing
would flare up again. Her sick cat had died weeks before.

The woman's neighbor in Smith Valley is a physician who came by her
house, took one look at her finger, and told her things did not look
well. She went to his office where he opened up her finger, cleaned
out the infection, and sent a culture to the lab. It was at this
point that the tularemia was pinpointed and a correct course of
treatment started.

[This case contains enough information to confirm ulceroglandular
_Francisella tularensis_ infection from a cat exposure. Although not
a common scenario for transmission of this zoonosis to man, it has
been described in both North America and Europe (1-4).
