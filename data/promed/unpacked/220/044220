A state of emergency has been declared in Florida after a leak from a large pond of toxic wastewater in Tampa Bay.

More than 300 homes in the area have been ordered to be evacuated, and a motorway near the Piney Point reservoir has been closed off. Residents were sent a text alert telling them to leave home immediately.

Officials said the 77-acre (31-hectare) reservoir holds millions of gallons of water containing phosphorous and nitrogen from an old phosphate plant. The pond where the leak was found is in a stack of phosphogypsum, a radioactive waste product from the manufacture of fertilizer. The water contains small amounts of naturally occurring radium and uranium, and the stacks can also release radon gas.

Attempts to repair the leak late on Friday [2 Apr 2021] by plugging the hole with rocks and other materials were unsuccessful. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis declared the state of emergency on Sat 3 Apr 2021.

Manatee County Administrator Scott Hopes told a press conference that there were concerns the water could flood the area, which is mostly agricultural.

"We are talking about the potential of about 600 million gallons (2.3 billion litres) within a matter of seconds and minutes, leaving the retention pool and going around the surrounding area," he said.

Thousands of gallons per minute is currently being pumped out of the reservoir now to bring the volume of water down, while other workers have been charting the path to control the flow of the water.

By declaring a state of emergency, funds can be released to send more pumps and cranes to the area.

[The stacks spoken of may be thought of as huge retaining walls of a water reservoir. These are many stories high and wide. A sudden deterioration of the wall that forced emergency evacuations is concerning.

"Gypsum is a mineral occurring both naturally and as a co- or by-product of many industrial processes. It has a wide range of uses in industry and agriculture. Phosphogypsum (PG) refers specifically to the gypsum formed when phosphate ore is processed into fertilizer using sulfuric acid.

PG is a safe, reusable resource for which there are many beneficial uses. Phosphate rock is well-known for its variability and may contain trace quantities of many different elements, some of which can be very beneficial in their own right, for example as nutrients to plants. PG may also contain low residual concentrations of naturally occurring radium from the source rock, which must be characterized carefully before use. Depending on the levels, regulators may require some specific restrictions, as for example when used in residential buildings."

"Phosphogypsum is a byproduct material of phosphate fertilizer production. It is regulated for the presence of radium-226, a naturally occurring radioactive substance producing radon gas, a hazardous air pollutant. The Clean Air Act requires the disposal of phosphogypsum in stacks, except for limited agricultural and research uses." (Source: https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-approves-use-phosphogypsum-road-construction.)

"Phosphogypsum is a waste by-product from the processing of phosphate rock in plants producing phosphoric acid and phosphate fertilizers, such as superphosphate. The wet chemical phosphoric acid treatment process, or wet process, in which phosphate ore is digested with sulfuric acid, is widely used to produce phosphoric acid and calcium sulfate, mainly in dihydrate form.

Phosphogypsum is contaminated by chemical and radioactive materials and, therefore, in the world is mostly dumped in stockpiled in controlled areas, and only about 15% is recycled; mostly as setting time retarder and in some construction elements (Tayibi et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2009).

Phosphogypsum contains, next to naturally occurring radionuclides, some trace elements such as arsenic, lead, cadmium, chromium, fluoride, zinc, antimony, copper (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1990), which may be leached. Therefore, phosphogypsum is mostly dumped in stockpiled in controlled areas, and only a minor part of it is recycled; mostly as setting time retarder and in some construction elements, which include the production of bricks, blocks, tiles, and artificial stone (Kumar, 2000, 2003; Weiguo et al., 2007; Tayibi et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2009). Degirmenci (2008) and some other researchers studied a possibility of the phosphogypsum utilization in combination with fly ash and lime, to produce a cementitious binder. The recent comprehensive publication of IAEA (2013) estimates that the recycling rate of phosphogypsum is still very low: less than 5%."
