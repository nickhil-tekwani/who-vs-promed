The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Division of Public Health Services (DPHS) is today [6 Jun 2012] announcing results related to testing of patients who had been treated at Exeter Hospital's Cardiac Catheterization Lab (CCL) beginning 1 Aug 2011. The NH Public Health Labs (PHL) have identified an additional 6 patients who match the strain of hepatitis C recently diagnosed in 4 people already associated with the CCL, bringing the total number of related cases to 10.

The initial 1st 4 cases identified last week [week of 28 May 2012] include 4 patients, one of whom is an Exeter Hospital employee. All these 10 individuals have been notified.

The investigation thus far has indicated the common link among the cases to be Exeter Hospital's Cardiac Catheterization Lab and its recovery room. DPHS and Exeter [Hospital] have been working in close collaboration since Exeter notified DPHS of the cluster. This is the 1st round of test results, additional results are still pending.

"We realize this may be very concerning, but we are working quickly and thoroughly to determine how these individuals were infected," said public health director Dr Jose Montero. "This is a complex investigation and it may take quite some time to pinpoint exactly how this happened. We will be sure to keep people informed as new information becomes available."

Because of these new results, DPHS is expanding its initial recommendations to test patients for hepatitis C, who received care at the Cath Lab and its recovery room on or after 1 Apr 2011, instead of 1 Aug 2011 through 25 May 2012. Exeter Hospital is in the process of calling all additional patients who now fit these criteria to schedule appointments for testing and expect to complete that process by the end of the day. DPHS is also testing staff who worked in the Cath Lab going back to 1 Sep 2011, which is an expansion from the original date of 1 Jan 2012.

DPHS has determined the Cath Lab is safe and has returned to normal operations.

Hepatitis C is a viral infection transmitted by blood. It causes inflammation of the liver that can lead to chronic health issues. It is passed from person to person through contact with an infected person's blood.

[This report describes an as yet undefined breach in disease security in a cardiac unit. Further information is awaited.

Hepatitis C is caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV infection sometimes results in an acute symptomatic illness. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong chronic condition that can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer. HCV is most commonly transmitted through exposure to infectious blood such as through: receipt of contaminated blood transfusions, blood products, and organ transplants; injections given with contaminated syringes, needle-stick injuries in health care settings; injection drug use; being born to an HCV infected mother. It is less commonly transmitted through sex with an infected person and sharing of personal items contaminated with infectious blood. HCV is not spread through breast milk, food or water, or by casual contact such as hugging, kissing, and sharing food or drinks with an infected person.

Diagnosis of acute infection is often missed because the infected person has no symptoms. Common methods of antibody detection cannot differentiate between acute and chronic infection. The presence of antibodies against HCV (anti-HCV) indicates that a person is or has been infected. HCV recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA) and HCV RNA testing are used to confirm the diagnosis of HCV infection. Diagnosis of chronic infection is made when anti-HCV is present for more than 6 months. Similar to acute infections, diagnosis should be confirmed with an additional test. Specialized tests are often used to evaluate patients for liver disease including cirrhosis and liver cancer.

Following initial infection, about 80 per cent of people do not exhibit any symptoms. Those people who are acutely symptomatic may exhibit fever, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, grey-coloured faeces, joint pain, and jaundice (yellowing of skin and the whites of the eyes). When a chronically-infected person develops symptoms, it may indicate advanced liver disease. Statistically, 60-70 per cent of chronically-infected people develop chronic liver disease, 5-20 per cent develop cirrhosis, and 1-5 per cent die from cirrhosis or liver cancer.

Precise laboratory diagnosis is becoming increasingly important because different strains of HCV respond differently to currently available therapies. Interferon and ribavirin-based therapy has been the mainstay of HCV treatment. Unfortunately, interferon is not widely available globally, is not always well tolerated, some genotypes respond better than others, and many people who take it do not finish their treatment. While HCV is generally considered to be a curable disease, for many persons this is not a reality. Fortunately, scientific advances and intense research and development have led to the development of many new oral antiviral drugs for HCV infection. The future seems to hold great promise for HCV specific oral drugs that will be more effective and better tolerated. Much still needs to be done to ensure that these advances lead to greater access and treatment globally.
