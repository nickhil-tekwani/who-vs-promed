Two more Wisconsin counties now have cases of avian influenza, with more than 126 000 poultry involved.

The new flocks affected by H5N2 avian influenza virus include 126 000 turkeys in a commercial flock in Barron County and 40 mixed breed birds in a backyard flock in Juneau County. Barron County is in northwest Wisconsin, and Juneau County is in central Wisconsin, just north of Sauk County.

The 1st flock to get the virus was a commercial egg-laying chicken flock in Jefferson County, with more than 180 000 chickens set to be killed to stop the spread of the disease from that location.

"These flocks are within the Mississippi flyway, where this strain of avian influenza has previously been identified," the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection [DATCP] said in a news release on Thursday [16 Apr 2015].

While deadly to poultry, the virus strain is not known to have caused disease in humans and is not expected to pose a risk to public health or to the food supply.

"Poultry meat and egg products in the marketplace remain safe to eat," DATCP said.

Officials are still not sure how the virus came to be in the Wisconsin flocks.

This disease continues its exponential race across the poultry areas of the USA. While the flyways are important and may represent a source of exposure to some avians, the rapid spread of this virus may indicate there is another connection, other than wild birds. - Mod.TG]
