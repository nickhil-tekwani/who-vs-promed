Following a yellow wheat rust epidemic across the country, millions
of farmers are seriously affected. The epidemic has reached all
wheat-growing areas of Ethiopia, covering over 2 million hectares
[approx 5 million acres] of land and will lead to an over 50 percent
harvest loss unless farms get sprayed with chemicals in a matter of
weeks, said the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research [EIAR].
[Some] pathologists fear the loss could be as high as 90 percent.

Ethiopia has just developed 2 new wheat varieties that researchers
say [have] durable [resistance] against [several fungal] wheat
diseases. Unfortunately the new varieties are not available for
public use as yet. The approval and subsequent multiplication
processes normally take years.

But the farmers cannot wait that long. So far, government has sprayed
a few private and all state-owned farms. Farmers are not sure whether
this will save the crop and most cannot afford the chemicals.

EIAR are attempting to release the new varieties of wheat before
officially having them approved. Even in this way, the new varieties
will reach only a small portion of wheat farmers in the next [growing] season.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the
fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. It causes yellow
leaf stripes and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100
percent. The disease affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale
(wheat/rye hybrids), and a number of wild grasses. Spores are wind
dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season, and the
fungus survives on living host plants generating a "green bridge"
between seasons. Disease management includes the use of resistant
varieties, fungicide applications, and control of volunteer crops.
Monitoring programmes are important to recognise emerging new strains.

New stripe rust strains with increased virulence have been reported
in recent years from Europe, North America, Australia, and India and
are also suspected to have emerged in China. The International Centre
for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas (ICARDA) has reported earlier
in 2010 that a number of countries in the Middle East and North
Africa are seriously affected by a new strain in the current growing
season, including Iran, Iraq, Morocco, Syria, Afghanistan, Algeria,
and Tunisia (ProMED-mail posts 20100531.1803 and 20100609.193). It is
unclear from the report above whether this is the same strain that
affects Ethiopian wheat.

Since new stripe rust strains will differ in national or regional
significance depending on the susceptibility of preferred cereal
varieties, regional breeding programmes for resistance to stripe rust
or combined resistance to stripe, stem and leaf rusts (as mentioned
above) are in progress. The process of releasing new varieties to
farmers has been slow not just in Ethiopia.
