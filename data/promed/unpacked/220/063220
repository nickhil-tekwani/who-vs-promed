Lethal virus claims more children
---------------------------------
A virus has spread rapidly, killing at least 22 children and
infecting more than 3300 others in Fuyang City, local authorities
said yesterday [2 May 2008]. The situation is so serious that the
city now faces quarantine.

Enterovirus 71 (EV71) began spreading in Fuyang, Anhui Province, in
early March 2008 and by the early hours of yesterday [2 May 2008],
3321 children had been infected by the virus, up from 2946 registered
a day earlier, said Wang Yan, a government spokesman. A total of 978
children remain in hospital, 48 of them in a critical condition, Wang
said.

A total of 32 medical specialists sent by the Ministry of Health and
the provincial health department have arrived in Fuyang to direct
proceedings. The province has upgraded its response plan for public
health emergencies from class 3 to 2, which means the provincial
government has the power to quarantine patients and control traffic in
and out of Fuyang, Xinhua news agency reported. Another 3 cities in
other parts of the country have also reported cases of enterovirus 71.
[See ProMED archives listed below].

Enteroviruses are spread mostly through contact with infected
blisters or feces and can cause high fever, paralysis and swelling of
the brain or its lining. Infection can lead to high mortality rates
in more serious cases and no vaccine is available.

EV71 cases usually peak from March to July. It began spreading in
Fuyang in early March 2008 as hospitals in the city started to take
in children with fever, blisters, mouth ulcers and rashes on the
hands and feet. Some were diagnosed with brain, heart and lung damage.

All cases in Fuyang were children aged below 6, most of them under 2
years of age. There are about 400 000 children below the age of 5 in
Fuyang. In a bid to stop the virus spreading, all kindergartens in
Fuyang began the 3-day May Day holiday 2 days early. More than 700
beds have been put into use in Fuyang's hospitals to treat the sick
children. Another 1200 beds have been prepared for future patients.

Zhejiang, Hong Kong
-------------------
Meanwhile, 5 children were confirmed with EV 71 in Hangzhou City,
Zhejiang Province, as of Wednesday night [30 Apr 2008], and 10 people
in Hong Kong have also been stricken by the virus as of yesterday.
Hong Kong last year had a total of 12 EV 71 cases. One of the Hong
Kong victims is a woman, who caught the virus from her 4-year-old
daughter on 24 Apr 2008. Both have recovered and been released from hospital.

Hubei
-----
The Hubei Province Health Department said EV 71 hit 340 young
children by 5pm on Thursday [1 May 2008]. No deaths were reported and
no new cases have been detected since Wednesday [30 Apr 2008].

[The current outbreak of human enterovirus 71-associated HFMD in
China appears to be most severe in the city of Fuyang in the province
of Anhui. Since the the previous report from Anhui dated 2 May 2008
(see: "Hand, foot & mouth disease - Asia: China (Hubei), Malaysia
(Sarawak) 20080502.1511"), the number of cases in Fuyang city has
risen from 2946 to 3321 and the number of deaths from 21 to 22. It is
not immediately clear why Fuyang city should be at greater risk.
