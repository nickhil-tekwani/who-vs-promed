Northern Australia is seeing significantly more cases of bovine ephemeral
fever this year. The mosquito-borne virus is traveling much further than
usual, specifically to inland areas not usually affected.
Regional veterinary officer for the Darwin region, Kel Small, says the near
record wet [season] has caused the problems. Small said, "Normally we see
activity in the northern parts of the NT [Northern Territory] but with the
big wet season we're seeing quite severe cases, seeing a few deaths, and
large numbers of affected animals being found recumbent, suffering lameness
and fever and a number of deaths as well."

[Ephemeral fever is an arthropod-transmitted, noncontagious, viral disease
of cattle and water buffalo. It occurs in Africa, Australia, and parts of
Asia. In apparent infections occur in cape buffalo, hartebeest, waterbuck,
wildebeest, deer and possibly goats.
Ephemeral fever virus is classified as a Rhabdovirus (single-stranded,
negative sense RNA). It is best isolated from infected cattle by
inoculation of mosquito (_Aedes albopictus_) cultures and defibrinated
blood and transferred to several types of cell cultures after 15 days.
The virus can be transmitted from infected to susceptible cattle by IV
inoculation; as little as 0.005mL of blood collected during the febrile
stage is infective. Transmission by contact or fomites does not occur, and
virus does not appear to persist in recovered cattle. Most recovered cattle
have life-long immunity.
Clinical signs can occur suddenly and vary in severity. They include
biphasic or polyphasic fever, shivering, inappetence, lacrimation, serous
nasal discharge, drooling, dyspnea, atony of forestomachs, depression,
stiffness and lameness and a sudden decrease in milk yield. Affected cattle
may become recumbent and paralyzed for 8 hours to greater than 1 week.
Bulls, other heavy cattle and heavily producing dairy caws are the most
severely affected, but spontaneous recovery usually occurs within a few
days. Perhaps the reason it is sometimes referred to as three-day sickness.
More insidious losses may result from decreased muscle mass and lowered
fertility in bulls.
Diagnosis is based almost entirely on clinical signs during an epidemic.
Confirmation is by serology, and rarely by virus isolation.
Complete rest is the most effective treatment, and recovering animals
should not be stressed or worked because relapse is likely.
Anti-inflammatory drugs give early and in repeated doses for 2-3 days are
effective. Oral dosing should be avoided unless the swallowing reflex is
functional.
Attenuated virus vaccines appear to be effective but should be used only in
endemic areas. Inactivated virus vaccines have not produced long-term
protection against experimental challenge with virulent virus and cannot
guarantee lasting immunity. - Mod. TG]
