Transylvania Public Health has received confirmatory laboratory tests from the NC State Laboratory of Public Health. Of those people who were tested by their medical providers, a majority were positive for norovirus. We believe this outbreak was caused by being exposed to a highly-contagious virus in a public place.

Although more information is continuing to come in, Transylvania Public Health has received more than 70 cases of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea reported by medical providers, as well as phone calls reporting similar symptoms in more than 200 people since [Tue 31 Jul 2018]. Norovirus typically causes diarrhea, vomiting, nausea and stomach pain that lasts for 1 to 3 days. Other symptoms can include fever, headache and body aches. These symptoms and length of illness match closely with the symptoms being reported by those who are ill.

People get norovirus from direct contact with an infected person, consuming food or water that has been contaminated with norovirus or touching contaminated surfaces and then putting your unwashed hands in your mouth. It only takes a few virus particles to make someone sick, and those who are ill shed billions of these particles. People are most contagious when they are having symptoms like vomiting and for the 1st few days after recovering, although they can spread norovirus for 2 weeks or more after they feel better.

Norovirus symptoms usually appear 24-48 hours after being exposed to the virus. Many (but not all) of the people who reported symptoms to us recalled visiting a local restaurant 1-2 days before becoming ill. Other people reported having close contact with someone who had norovirus symptoms prior to becoming ill.

According to press reports: "The McDonald's in Brevard reopened [Fri 3 Aug 2018], after closing voluntarily to deep clean the restaurant in the middle of the food illness outbreak."

[2] Washington State, possible norovirus (swimming lake)

Horseshoe Lake is an ideal place to cool down on scorching summer days. The county park in South Kitsap offers shady trails, ample parking and a small but easy-to-access beach, drawing swarms of visitors on warm weekends. "It's one of our most popular recreational swimming beaches in the area," Kitsap Public Health District's Jim Zimny said.

Horseshoe's popularity as a swimming hole has a downside. As dozens of visitors pack into the small swimming area, the potential for viral outbreaks increases. The lake has been linked to 3 such outbreaks in the past decade. Each occurred during hot weather, when lots of people were swimming.

Reports from the most recent round of illness began trickling in last weekend from people who'd swum at the lake and developed a gastrointestinal illness. Officials closed the lake as a precaution. By [Fri 3 Aug 2018], the health district was investigating 139 cases.

The source of the illnesses has not been confirmed by a laboratory, but symptoms are consistent with norovirus, according to the health district. The last norovirus outbreak originated at Horseshoe Lake in 2014, sickening nearly 300 people.

According to health officials, the outbreaks begin when one or several people infected with a virus decide to go for a swim. Those people then defecate or throw up in the water. "Somebody likely had a diarrheal or vomiting event in the lake," Zimny summarized. The virus spreads as other people swim or wade nearby and ingest water. Children frequently become ill by drinking lake water.

Viruses don't live long or transmit easily on lake surfaces, but when viral loads are high enough, and many swimmers squeeze into a small space, a virus can infect large groups. A norovirus outbreak in 2010 was traced back to a single child.

Simple steps, like showering thoroughly before and after swimming and not going to lakes or pools within days of being sick, can help prevent the spread of waterborne pathogens. People can help officials investigate health risks by reporting illnesses and water quality concerns like discolored water or odors. "We can respond faster and we can protect public health better," health district spokeswoman Karen Bevers said.

[Norovirus is the leading cause of illness and outbreaks from contaminated food in the United States. About 50 per cent of all outbreaks of food-related illness are caused by norovirus. Food can get contaminated with norovirus at any point when it is being grown, shipped, handled, or prepared. The commonest outbreak settings include healthcare facilities, restaurants and catered events, cruise ships, schools and other institutional settings. - Mod.LL
