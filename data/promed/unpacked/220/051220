Vaccination of domestic animals started in the Gori region
----------------------------------------------------------
The municipality of Gori has decided to carry out vaccination of
domestic animals against the most dangerous infectious diseases --
rabies, anthrax, and foot-and-mouth disease [FMD].

The 1st phase of vaccinations will be carried out in foci of probable
anthrax epidemic, namely the villages of Medzhvrishevi, Kvahvreli,
Uplistsikhe, Hidistavi, and Akhaldaba. The vaccination will involve
4200 heads of cattle.

Vaccination against rabies and FMD will begin within a week and will
continue up to 3 months. A total of 35 700 head of cattle are to be
vaccinated within the Gori region.

[Gori is a district (Raion) in Georgia's Shida Kartli region (see map
at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_%28country%29#Regions.2C_republics.2C_and_districts>).
The Gori district included the territory of the former Tskhinvali
district. Some northern territories of the district are part of the
self-proclaimed republic of South Ossetia, and have not been under
control of the Georgian government since 1992.

Anthrax and rabies are regarded to be endemic in Georgia, and have
been officially reported to occur in 2007, while -- according to
Georgia's official semiannual and annual reports for 2007, FMD
occurred for the last time in 2002. In July 2007, the disease was
suspected in Lori, an Armenian district bordering Georgia, but no
confirmation has been forthcoming.

Has the current vaccination in Gori been undertaken in view of
suspected or recorded cases? Clarification will be welcomed. - Mod.AS]
