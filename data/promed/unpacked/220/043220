Tick-borne encephalitis in Europe: basic information, country by country
-----------------------------------------------
On 24 Jun 2004, Eurosurveillance Weekly published overviews of the
tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) situation in the Czech Republic, Lithuania
and Latvia (1-3). This week [week ending Sun 18 Jul 2004], we publish brief
information from other countries in Europe where TBE infections may be
acquired. Web-sites of national institutes have more data [see original
text for list - Mod.CP], and more information on TBE in Europe can be found
at the web-site of the International Scientific Working Group on
Tick-Borne-Encephalitis (ISW-TBE). <http://www.tbe-info.com>
The following table shows the number of cases reported in the most recent
year, and, incidence, where available. Data provided by listed
contributors, and from references (1-3).

Austria
-----
Meningoencephalitis is a notifiable disease in Austria. There were 87 cases
of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in Austria in 2003: an incidence rate of
1.09 per 100 000. In 2002, there were 51 cases, and, in 2002, 60 cases.
Regions most affected by TBE are in the south: Steiermark (Styria) and
Karnten (Carinthia). All of these cases were in unvaccinated people, or, in
people who had not had the vaccine according to the recommended schedule.
In the past 5 years, vaccine coverage of the entire population has risen
from 79 percent to 87 percent. The coverage rate for very young children,
and people over 65, is under 70 percent. This lower coverage in older
people represents the biggest challenge for prevention of TBE in Austria.
Vaccination is not free, but, health insurance companies pay part of the
cost (this varies according to region).
Denmark
-----
TBE is not a notifiable disease in Denmark. The only area where there is a
risk of acquiring TBE is on the island of Bornholm.
People who live on Bornholm permanently, or have a summer holiday home
there, are advised to get vaccinated, if they do activities which involve
leaving the designated paths in woods or scrub land. Tourists and school
parties are not considered to require vaccination unless participating in
activities that take place in a fixed location in the woods.
Finland
-----
TBE is a notifiable disease in Finland. The absolute number of TBE cases
has risen from an annual 10-20 in the 1990s to over 40 cases in 2001
(population 5.2 million). The incidence of identified cases is highest
(i.e. over 100/100 000/year) on the island of Aland, which is situated
between Finland and Sweden. According to antibody analyses, approximately
one out of 5 Alanders becomes infected during his or her lifetime. TBE
infections are rare in children and adolescents. In addition to the
Alanders, approximately 10 Swedes annually fall ill with TBE after visiting
Aland. Foci of TBE also exist elsewhere in Finland, for example, in the
Turku archipelago, and, in some areas of southeast Finland, around Kokkola,
and on Isosaari, which is close to Helsinki.
The National Public Health Institute (KTL) recommends vaccination against
TBE for all those over 7 years of age who reside in, or spend long periods
in, the known endemic areas. The vaccine is not, however, currently part of
the Finnish national immunization program. A TBE vaccination subcommittee
of KTL has recently completed an analysis of the TBE disease burden on
Aland, and, the impact of the different vaccination strategies, including
cost-effectiveness, and, whether the vaccine should be given free of charge.
Germany
-----
TBE is notifiable in Germany. In 2003, 276 cases of TBE were reported
(2002: 239; 2001: 256). These occurred mainly in southern Germany in the
federal states of Baden-Wurttemberg (42 percent) and Bavaria (38 percent).
Counties in Germany are classified according to 3 levels of TBE risk. A
county is classified as a high risk area if at least 25 TBE cases occurred
within a 5-year period between 1984-2003, and as a risk area if at least 2
cases occurred within a single year, or, at least 5 cases occurred within a
5-year period between 1984-2003. Areas are declared to be TBE endemic areas
based on elevated TBE seroprevalence in studies in non-immunized forestry
workers. In 2003, 3 new districts were identified as risk areas. 74 of
Germany's 440 counties are currently classified as TBE risk areas, and 9 as
high risk areas. They are located in Baden-Wurttemberg (30), Bavaria (45),
Hesse (4), Thuringia (3) and Rhineland-Palatinate. A further 5 counties in
Baden-Wurttemberg are classified as endemic for TBE based on seroprevalence
studies. See map:
<http://www.rki.de/INFEKT/EPIBULL/2004/FSME21_04.PDF>
The Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) recommends TBE vaccination
for persons at risk of tick exposure in high risk and risk areas.
Hungary
-----
TBE has been mandatory notifiable in Hungary since 1977, and data are
collected by the Bela Johan National Center for Epidemiology (formerly, the
National Institute of Public Health). Samples from patients with aseptic
meningitis and encephalitis have been regularly tested for TBE at the
center's division of virology since 1958, which is the only diagnostic
laboratory for TBE in Hungary. The average yearly incidence between 1977
and 1996 was 2.5 per 100 000 population (range 1.3 to 3.8), with the
highest incidences between 1981 and 1990. From 1997 to 2000, a significant
decrease in the number of the registered/diagnosed TBE cases were observed,
with incidence of 0.5 per 100 000 in 2000. Since 2001, the incidence has
been slowly increasing again. In the last 3 years, the yearly average of
the reported cases was 63.
The high risk areas are the counties of Zala, Somogy, Vas (western Hungary)
and Nograd (northern Hungary), which are in the areas of the known natural
foci (Central and Western Transdanubia, and the northern central mountain
chain).
Vaccination for the highest risk groups (forestry and agriculture workers,
etc.) was introduced in 1977. Vaccination is carried out by campaigns that
are organized and controlled by the state. Since 1991, TBE vaccine has been
available for all, through purchase at pharmacies, and employers must
ensure the vaccination of employees. No detailed data on TBE vaccination
coverage is currently available, although a rough estimate is that 5
percent of the population has been vaccinated, mostly people living in high
risk areas.
Norway
-----
All cases of encephalitis are notifiable in Norway, including TBE. In 2003,
one case of TBE was reported. Only 8 cases of TBE acquired in Norway have
so far ever been reported. The 1st case was identified in 1998. All cases
were acquired within a limited area on the southern coast, and 4 were
diagnosed in the municipality of Tromoy. A study done among regular
patients attending a health center in Tromoy showed a seroprevalence of 2.4
percent with TBEV antibodies (4). This area probably represents a small
focus of the disease in Norway. In addition, 2 cases of imported TBE have
been reported since 1994. These were acquired in endemic areas in Sweden
and Austria.
Due to low incidence in Norway, vaccination is currently not recommended as
protection against transmission within the country. It is only recommended
for travelers planning outdoor activities in forested endemic areas abroad.
Poland
-----
TBE is a notifiable disease in Poland, where it has been endemic for more
than 30 years. Since 1993, the number of reported cases at country level
ranged from 100 to 350 cases per year. In 2002 the number of reported cases
was 126 (incidence 0.33 per 100 000), and in 2003, the number of reported
cases was 339 (incidence 0.89 per 100 000). 80 percent of cases occurred in
2 northeastern provinces of Poland adjacent to Lithuania and Belarus. A 2nd
focus of the disease was in the southwestern part of Poland, in districts
adjacent to the Czech Republic.
Vaccination, using a 3-dose schedule, is recommended for high-risk groups
living in endemic areas, and, tourists visiting endemic places. Certain
risk groups (foresters, soldiers, timber industry employees) are immunized
in regular campaigns paid for by their employers.
Slovakia
-----
TBE is a compulsory notifiable disease in Slovakia. The number of reported
cases at country level has ranged from 54 to 101 cases per year in the last
10 years. In 2002, the number of reported cases was 62 (incidence 1.15 per
100 000), and in 2003, the number of reported cases was 74 (incidence 1.38
per 100 000). Some of the reported cases were caused by drinking raw goat
and sheep milk (home production).
Longitudinal monitoring of TBE virus in ticks, and vertebrate hosts
(including humans), between 1964-1997 resulted in identification of 37
natural endemic foci (in the original text this is illustrated by a
figure). Vaccination using a 3-dose schedule is recommended for high risk
groups living, or working in, endemic areas, and, for tourists visiting
endemic areas. The cost of vaccination for those who work in TBE endemic
foci is reimbursed by health insurance.
Slovenia
-----
TBE, and Lyme borreliosis, are endemic in the northern part of Slovenia,
and are notifiable diseases. In 2003, 272 cases of TBE were reported, an
incidence of 13.6 / 100 000. Similar numbers of cases were reported in 2002
(262 cases) and 2001 (260 cases).
Efforts are being directed towards early diagnostics, antibiotic treatment,
and awareness campaigns. A vaccination campaign coordinated by the National
Institute of Public Health is in place throughout the country, from late
autumn to spring, annually. TBE immunization is recommended by ministry of
health, and, offered by general practitioners and epidemiologists to
anybody who spends time outdoor in the endemic areas, including short-term
visitors.
Vaccination is obligatory for those carrying out military service and other
professionally exposed persons, including forestry and agriculture
students. The cost of vaccination is covered by health insurance for
students only. Coverage in those professionally exposed, and in students,
is very high (98 percent). Coverage in the general population is,
unfortunately, below 10 percent.
Sweden
-----
TBE infection is included in voluntary laboratory reporting for infectious
disease surveillance in Sweden. To gather more information about the spread
of TBE in the country, a questionnaire is sent from the laboratories to the
physicians, who are requested to identify probable place of infection and
known tick bite. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, around 50 to 70 TBE
cases were being reported annually. The majority of the patients were
diagnosed through hospital care. Since the end of the 1990s, around 100
cases have been reported annually, of which, approximately 20 percent were
treated through primary health care. During the same period, the disease
attracted increased public attention. It is, therefore, difficult to say
whether there has been a real increase in the number of cases, or,
increased diagnosis due to a higher clinical awareness, or, that samples
have been taken to a greater extent. Apart from the fact that more cases
have been observed by primary health care, several cases were reported in
recent years from areas where, previously, only occasional cases had been
detected.
In 2003, 107 cases of TBE were notified (in 75 men and 32 women). Most of
the infections were acquired in the counties of Stockholm (56 percent),
Sodermanland (15 percent) and Uppsala (6 percent). In the county of Vastra
Gotaland (to the south of Lake Vanern), 5 to 10 cases are notified
annually. Sporadic cases occur in the rest of Sweden every year.
Vaccination is recommended for high risk groups residing in endemic areas,
and, for people who live in endemic areas during the summer.
