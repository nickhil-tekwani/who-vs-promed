This Thursday [18 Dec 2008], the Health Secretariat in the Federal
District confirmed a case of human rabies in a child 9 years of age
hospitalized for 3 weeks in the Base Hospital. The disease was
confirmed by laboratory tests.

The boy is from Goias state and had been bitten by a bat in that
state. He was brought to the hospital in Brasilia, and his condition
was considered serious. He is in an induced coma in the pediatric ICU
and is undergoing a treatment developed by U.S. doctors.

According to Dr Antezana Disney, Secretary of Health Monitoring in
the DF, the hospitalization of the child does not bring risks of
transmission of the disease.

The Department of Health does not have numbers of human rabies cases
attended to in other states, only those cases of rabies contracted in
the DF; there is only one record from 1978. At the time, the person
died.

[It will be interesting to see whether the patient survives, and, if
so, without serious neurological sequelae. A previous case in October
2008 (see ProMED archive no. 20081122.3689) did survive and was
treated according to the Wisconsin protocol that was developed to
treat a rabies case in Wisconsin, USA, who also survived (see ProMED
archive no 20041231.3459).
