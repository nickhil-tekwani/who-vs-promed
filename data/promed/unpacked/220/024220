Synercid (quinupristin/dalfopristin) is a combination of streptogramins A
and B that inhibits protein synthesis. While many isolates (but not all) of
_Enterococcus faecium_ with VanA and VanB phenotypes are susceptible (1),
_E. faecalis_ strains are uniformly resistant, and superinfection has been
reported during therapy (2).
Quinupristin/dalfopristin is bacteriostatic only, with the potential of
allowing the emergence of resistance (3).
While synercid may offer a short term solution to the treatment of VREF
infections when no alternative treatment is available, the drug may have a
limited role long term in treating multi-drug resistant enterococci
infections (4).
Novel oxazolidinones and glycylcyclines have also been shown to be useful
against enterococci and multi-drug resistant enterococci, however further
testing is still required (5,6).
