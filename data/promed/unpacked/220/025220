Diarrhoea outbreak in Botswana probably due to cryptosporidium
--------------------------------------------------------------
The number of children who have died from diarrhoea has reached 191 out of
the reported 10 339 cases. The director of public health, Matsae Balosang,
said on Monday that they suspect the outbreak might be caused by
cryptosporidium parasites. However, she asserted that further
investigations and tests are needed to confirm the causative organism.
Microscopic parasites of the genus _Cryptosporidium_ cause a type of
diarrhoea known as cryptosporidiosis. The parasite lives in the intestines
of human beings and animals and is usually found in the stool.
Balosang said investigations at the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) in
Atlanta, America have found cryptosporidium in 31 of the 55 samples sent
from Francistown. She emphasised hygienic practices such as washing of
hands with soap at all times. She encouraged people to boil all drinking
water regardless of whether it is from the taps or not and to thoroughly
wash vegetables and fruits. Balosang said that CDC Atlanta and WHO have
offered a team of experts -- a virologist and epidemiologist -- to help.
She said that although they will observe the affected 10 districts, they
are currently keeping a keen eye on Mahalapye and Good Hope.
Balosang said that health workers have been mobilised to areas where there
is an outbreak. Resources such as bedding, mattresses and back up tents
have been dispatched to the districts. She encouraged mothers to
breastfeed, emphasising that it is better than formula-feeding. She
cautioned that bottle feeding require a high level of hygiene. She said
that babies are more disadvantaged because of body size and loss of fluids.
She called for parents to bring their children to health facilities
immediately they show signs of diarrhoea. Meanwhile Bobirwa and
Selebi-Phikwe areas have experienced at least 18 diarrhoea deaths. Selebi
Phikwe mayor, Molosiwa Molosiwa said the dead are babies under one year and
they were weak even before the onset of diarrhoea. During a full council
meeting yesterday Molosiwa called for people to distinguish diarrhoea from
cholera. He said Botswana has never had a single verified cholera case.

[_Cryptosporidium_ spp. occur worldwide and are a well known cause of
diarrhoea in children in tropical Africa. Studies from South Africa have found
cryptosporidium in 4 per cent to 6 per cent of stool samples from children
(Loening WE, et al. Ann Trop Paediatr 1989; 9: 248-55, Fripp PJ, et al. J
Infect 1991; 23: 93-100). The reservoir for cryptosporidia is usually calves
and human infections are seen when drinking water infected with calf feces
containing cryptosporidium cysts.
The present outbreak may be caused by cryptosporidium, but it is important
to exclude other sources. ï¿½ Mod.EP]
[In spring 1993, a municipal water supply in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA,
contaminated with Cryptosporidium caused the largest recognized outbreak of
waterborne illness in the history of the United States. More than 400 000
persons become ill, 4400 of whom required hospitalization. There were some
deaths among immunocompromised persons. --see 1994 ref. below.
