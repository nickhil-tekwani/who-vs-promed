Mystery virus worries ministry
------------------------------
A mystery influenza outbreak in Fiji is a concern to the Ministry of
Health, who has yet to identify its cause. National disease outbreak
specialist Dr Joe Koroivueta confirmed that 16 484 influenza-like cases had
been reported from hospitals and health centres around the country from
January to early September 2004.
"To date we have not been able to identify the causative agent for the
influenza-like disease now in existence in Fiji," he said. "Valelevu is
seeing 50 cases per day, as are other medical facilities of the greater
Suva area. This mysterious flu is more prominent in densely populated areas
of Fiji."
The statistics do not include those who have been examined by private
practitioners, which are not reported. "The scenario in the private health
facilities has not been captured by our system," Dr Koroivueta said yesterday.
He said blood samples from patients that fit their surveillance case
definition were tested. All the samples were tested for influenza A and B,
dengue, and leptospirosis, but the results were negative. Dr Koroivueta
said further samples would be sent to Australia early next week. "In the
last 2 weeks, we collected 50 sera from patients, and the sera of those
with ILI [influenza-like illness] were tested for influenza A and B, dengue
and leptospirosis," he said. "The further samples will be shipped to Dr Ian
Barr's Laboratory in Melbourne and Dr Greg Smith's Laboratory in Brisbane
early next week."
The symptoms of the mysterious influenza are cough, sore throat, fever and
body aches. "There were no rash or skin haemorrhagic lesions noted and
there has been no case of bleeding or death attributed to the ILI cases to
our knowledge," Dr Koroivueta.
Since the ILI is a communicable disease, he called for the public to be
more alert and to look after their health. Dr Koroivueta said those
infected should take extra precaution, have a lot of bed rest and increase
their fluid consumption.

does not mention mortalities associated with this outbreak, as is commonly
seen with influenza outbreaks. More information on the results of
investigations on the outbreak in Fiji would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
