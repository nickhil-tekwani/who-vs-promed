Health officials are investigating what they are calling the 1st recorded case of human plague in Georgia. An unidentified Georgia resident was infected while hiking in California. The California Department of Public Health said that the "presumptive positive case" occurred when the tourist visited in early August 2015.

The Georgia Public Health Laboratory confirmed later Wednesday, 19 Aug 2015, that the patient did test positive for bubonic plague. The CDC is also conducting tests to confirm the diagnosis. The person was hospitalized in Georgia and released Tuesday night, 18 Aug 2015.

Doctors caution travelers to western states, where plague is naturally occurring, to prevent flea bites and get immediate medical care if they start to feel symptoms.

"Antimicrobials are effective in treating plague, but without prompt treatment, the disease can cause serious illness or death," Patrick O'Neal, M.D., director of health protection for the Georgia Department of Public Health, said in a press release.

[This is the same case initially reported as acquired in California (Plague - USA (08): (CA) 20150819.3589079), but this report confirms that the diagnosis was made in Georgia. As noted, _Yesinia pestis_ is not found in the eastern or Midwestern parts of the USA and if it is diagnosed, the patient either traveled from a endemic area or is the victim of either an intentional or accidental release of the organism. - Mods.LL/MPP
