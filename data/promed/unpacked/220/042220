[The number of cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) reported
from North and South America has increased in recent weeks.
Therefore, for the time being, reports of HPS from North and South
America will be combined and posted in the form of updates at
intervals determined by the frequency of such reports.
The CDC website
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hanta/hps/index.htm> identifies
hantaviruses in the New World as follows. North America: Hantaviruses
in the New World are associated with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
(HPS). Sigmodontine rodents carry the hantaviruses that cause HPS and
are found throughout the Americas. Sin Nombre virus, carried by
_Peromyscus maniculatus_, is the predominant cause of HPS in the
United States and Canada. Mononghela, New York, Bayou, and Black
Creek Canal viruses also cause HPS and are found in eastern Canada
and eastern and southeastern United States. In South and Central
America, hantaviruses that have been identified as causing HPS are
Andes virus in Argentina and Chile; Andes-like viruses including
Oran, Lechiguanas, and Hu39694 in Argentina; Laguna Negra virus in
Bolivia and Paraguay; Bermejo virus in Argentina; Juquitiba virus in
Brazil; and Choclo virus in Panama. Numerous other hantaviruses have
been identified but have not been linked to human disease. - Mod.CP]

Brazil: Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome Death in Gama
---------------------------------------------------
After 2 weeks without a new case, the Health Secretary confirmed one
more death yesterday afternoon [Mon 13 Sep 2004] from hantavirus
infection. The victim had been sick for 3 weeks in Gama [in the
Federal District, near the capital, Brasilia]; the health authorities
are trying to identify where exactly he became infected. The cause
of death was confirmed by the Adolfo Lutz Institute in Sao Paulo
[Brazil].
The last death from hantavirus infection was on 19 Aug 2004, of a
farmer from Luziania (Goias state) who had spent the weekend in
Niquelandia, in the north of Goias, 250 km from Brasilia.
Since the outbreak began in May 2004, 33 cases of hantavirus
infection have been registered in the Federal District [Brasilia] &
surrounding area, of whom 11 have died. [More cases have been
reported from other states; see refs. below. - Mod.JW]
