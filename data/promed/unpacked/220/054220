[A] Los Angeles County
Date: Sun 17 Jan 2021

Los Angeles County, one of the hardest-hit areas in the United States, may face even more dire weeks ahead. Hospitals have run out of room in intensive care units, though new cases and hospitalizations appear to be leveling off in recent days. And as the national death toll nears 400 000, deaths continue to climb in Los Angeles County, which recently recorded its worst week ever for COVID-19 fatalities. The county records a coronavirus-related death roughly every 7 minutes.

And now that there are variants of the virus that could be more contagious circulating in California, those numbers may rise.

It took nearly 10 months for Los Angeles County, America's most populous, to hit 400 000 cases, but little more than a month to add another 400 000, from [30 Nov 2020] to [2 Jan 2021], according to a New York Times database. On Saturday [16 Jan 2021], the county became the nation's first to surpass 1 million recorded coronavirus infections, a number only 4 states other than California have exceeded: Illinois, New York, Florida, and Texas.

And the true rate of infections may be much higher than the one reported: one in 3 Los Angeles residents is believed to have been infected with the virus since the beginning of the pandemic, according to the Los Angeles Department of Health.

The virus is surging across California, where daily deaths are averaging 528, an increase of over 15 percent from a week ago. Much of the state, including the southern region, remains under a stay-at-home order. The state is one of many dealing with the arrival of a more contagious viral variant, first discovered in Britain; the 1st confirmed case in Los Angeles was reported on Saturday [15 Jan 2021]. It is believed to be 50 percent more transmissible than the previous version of the virus. Officials said they thought the variant, which has caused infections to soar in London and southeast England, has been spreading through Los Angeles for some time. While more contagious, the variant does not appear to cause more severe illness.

Barbara Ferrer, the director of the county's public health department, called the arrival of the variant "troubling, as our health care system is already severely strained with more than 7500 people currently hospitalized."

On Sunday night [17 Jan 2021], the California Department of Public Health reported another variant that had grown more common across the state since December [2020]. Known as L452R, it was first detected in Denmark in March [2020] and appeared in California in May [2020]. In December [2020], researchers at the University of California, San Francisco sequenced genomes of coronavirus gathered around the state and found that the variant was present in just 3.8 percent of their samples. By January [2021], it had jumped to 25.2 percent.

Charles Chiu, who led the sequencing, cautioned that he and his colleagues worked with a small sample size, so they have not yet proven that this variant is more contagious. "But there are worrisome signs that this variant may be highly transmissible," he said. Dr Chiu and his colleagues are now looking more carefully for this variant across the state and are trying to understand how its mutations have altered it. They want to see if the variant can escape from antibodies and perhaps even make vaccines less effective. "These are critical studies that need to be done," Dr Chiu said.

After weeks under a stay-at-home order, the county's positivity rate is starting to taper. Dr George Rutherford, an epidemiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, said the state and Los Angeles seemed to be "in the process of sort of gradually turning a corner here." He cautioned against panicking about the more transmissible variant, noting the same cautious behavior will help keep it at bay: stay home, wear a mask, physically distance.

The variant has landed in California during a chaotic vaccination rollout, made more so after Gov Gavin Newsom's announcement on Wednesday [13 Jan 2021] that the state would open up eligibility to anyone 65 or older, effectively abandoning a rollout plan that was meant to ensure that the most vulnerable would be first in line. Los Angeles County, which opened a mass vaccination center at Dodger Stadium, said it would continue vaccinating only healthcare workers through at least the end of the month [January 2021].

With its decentralized public health system, California is a microcosm of the many problems plaguing the national inoculation effort. Experts say the burden has been unduly placed on county public health departments that are left struggling with a deluge of monumental tasks, from testing to contact tracing and now, distributing vaccines. And they're often doing it with outdated and overwhelmed information systems.

Dr David Lubarsky, the chief executive of UC Davis Health, said the counties were up against the same problem they faced when trying to ramp up testing: too little manpower. He suggested that the state should hand more vaccine doses directly to health care providers, who already have the ability to contact vulnerable patients who might be hard for officials to reach.

Jonah Frohlich, a San Francisco-based health care consultant with Manatt Health Strategies, said the counties are doing the best they can, but such an ambitious undertaking should take years, and "there is a real human cost to delaying the rollout of the vaccine."

[B] Variant L452R
Date: Sat 16 Jan 2021 10:15 PM PST

https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/New-COVID-19-variant-increasingly-found-in-15878547.php


Another coronavirus variant is spreading across California, including in the Bay Area, where it has been linked to multiple large outbreaks, public health officials warned Sunday [17 Jan 2021]. The variant, which is labeled L452R, is different from the highly-transmissible B.1.1.7 variant that was first found in the United Kingdom.

San Francisco and Santa Clara counties are among those where the variant was found. Scientists first identified L452R in Denmark early in the pandemic, and it was subsequently found in California and other states last year [2020], said Dr Charles Chiu, a virologist and professor of laboratory medicine at UCSF.

But officials are now seeing a sharp rise of the variant in California. In mid-December [2020], COVID-19 researchers had detected the variant in less than 4% of California samples they studied. By early January [2021], L452R was found in more than 25% of specimens examined by researchers, Chiu said. Chiu said there is likely some bias in the sampling, since California does not have a truly systemic virus surveillance program. But the variant appears to be more widespread now than it was before, showing up in urban and rural counties alike.

While much remains unknown about L452R, Chiu said it has mutations to the spike-shaped protein that the coronavirus uses to infect cells. Those mutations raise the possibility that the variant could reduce the effectiveness of the coronavirus vaccines, although more study is needed to arrive at a conclusive answer. "The data so far is very preliminary, but it basically does raise the concern that there may be some impact on the vaccine," Chiu told reporters on a video conference call Sunday [17 Jan 2021].

Experts do not currently believe the B.1.1.7 variant, which also has changes in the spike protein, will harm the effectiveness of vaccines. In California, researchers and public health officials are trying to figure out if the L452R variant is more transmissible than other versions of COVID-19 that have circulated in the state.

Dr Sara Cody, the public health officer in Santa Clara County, said that her county -- the epicenter of the Bay Area's latest COVID-19 surge -- has been particularly aggressive about monitoring the virus. "We in Santa Clara County have been doing more looking and, thus, more finding," Cody told reporters on the conference call. "Anytime that we have a large outbreak, we take a subset of those specimens and send them for sequencing."

Cody confirmed that the variant was identified in the massive outbreak at a Kaiser Permanente emergency room in San Jose, which sickened more than 90 staff and patients people and led to one death. An inflatable Christmas costume, powered by an air pump, may have helped the virus to spread.

[The state of California and specifically Los Angeles County is the current "epicenter of the pandemic in the USA. With 50 states and the District of Columbia, the epicenter has shifted through the months. During the 1st wave, New York State was the epicenter, and with a lockdown, the state was able to flatten the curve. In the latter part of the summer (late August and September 2020), the epicenter shifted to the Dakotas (North and South Dakota).

The mention that the estimate is that 1 in 3 people living in Los Angeles county has been infected is a very large number of individuals -- the 2019 population estimate in Los Angeles county was 10.04 million, suggesting that there have been 3.35 million infected individuals in the county alone.

With respect to the L452R variant, the Santa Clara county public health officer, Dr Cody, has basically used my favorite adage "seek and ye shall find" or, it's corollary "don't look and it ain't there," to somewhat put this into perspective.

The outbreak associated with the inflatable costume was covered in COVID-19 update (04): India vaccines, Nigeria, Thailand, transmission, WHO, global 20210104.8068745. At the time the report was posted, there were 44 identified infected individuals. According to the media report above, the count is up to more than 90, a major superspreading event. The question that remains is whether the superspreading event was related to enhanced aerosolization of the virus containing particles due to the fan that sucks air into the inflatable costume, or is it related to the variant virus that is possibly more easily transmissible. Studies are pending and answers should be available.

As for concern that this new variant will impact on immunity produced by the vaccines, to date we have dodged this bullet as the other variants with spike protein alterations have not been shown to evade the vaccine-produced immunity. This may change with time as the vaccine may result in pressure on the virus to mutate to "protect itself".

We await results of further studies on this mutant.

The laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in Pakistan has surpassed the milestone of 0.5 million after 2 other South Asian countries, India and Bangladesh.

The daily case positivity against the total number of samples tested in Bangladesh continued falling further, and as lowest as below 5% was recorded yesterday (14 Jan 2021). The total number of daily COVID-19 cases in India was dropping steadily, and the daily positive cases remained below 20 000 but above 15 000. India has reported 109 people so far affected with the variant virus.

After phases of dry running, everything is set in India, the 1st ever in South Asia, to launch its much-awaited mass vaccination program against the disease from tomorrow (16 Jan 2020) using the vaccine "Covishield", developed by AstraZeneca with Oxford University.

A total of 45 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours (compared with 55 on Fri 15 Jan 2021); 19 of the 45 countries that reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region (down from 28 on Fri 15 Jan 2021), 12 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 3 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 7.8%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 3.9%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the United States show a 13.3% decrease in daily reported cases and a 3.1% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported cases are over 500 000 newly confirmed infections daily in the past 24 hours and over 95.4 million cumulative reported cases with over 2.03 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, even with the weekend reporting artifact. Africa has been showing increases over the last few weeks with now 3-4 countries reporting over 1000 cases per day. China has been reporting over 100 new cases per day for 7 out of the last 8 days. It is too early to tell whether the major lockdowns in Europe are impacting transmission. - Mod.MPP]
