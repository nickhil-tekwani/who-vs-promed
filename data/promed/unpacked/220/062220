Bali death blamed on bird flu
----------------------------------
A 2nd woman may have died from bird flu on the Indonesian resort
island of Bali. Preliminary test results show the 28-year-old had the
deadly H5N1 strain, an Indonesian Health Ministry staffer says. If
more reliable tests being carried out in Jakarta confirm the results,
she will be the 2nd person to have died in Bali from the virus within
two weeks.
The island's 1st confirmed victim was a 29-year-old woman, who died
on 12 Aug 2007. Her 5-year-old daughter died on 3 Aug 2007 after
suffering flu-like symptoms, but her body was cremated before samples
were taken for testing.
The woman who died on Tuesday [21 Aug 2007] in Bali's Sanglah
Hospital was a poultry distributor from Tabanan District. Most human
cases of H5N1 are linked to contact with infected birds, but experts
fear the virus will mutate into a form that spreads easily among
humans, potentially sparking a pandemic. The woman was admitted to
hospital on Sunday [19 Aug 2007] suffering bird flu-like symptoms
including fever, breathing difficulties and coughing.
A 58-year-old man who is being treated at Sanglah Hospital has also
been tested for bird flu. His condition appeared to be improving,
Bali Health Agency chief Dr Dewa Ketut Oka said. The man, who was a
garbage worker, had contact with dead chickens through his job, Oka said.
"They (the woman and man) are still (bird flu) suspects. We already
sent the samples to the health ministry in Jakarta," Oka said,
stressing that the Jakarta tests were the ones that counted. An
Indonesian Health Ministry staffer, who did not want to be named,
told AAP that preliminary test results indicated the woman had H5N1,
but the man did not. "According to information from Sanglah hospital,
the regional test for (the woman) is positive but the sample for (the
male patient) is negative," she said.
The bird flu issue is sensitive in Bali, where the tourism industry
is only just recovering from the 2002 and 2005 bombings. None of the
recent bird flu cases, or suspected cases, were from areas close to
Bali's tourist precincts.
Meanwhile, Indonesia has sent bird flu samples to the World Health
Organisation to allay fears that the virus had mutated. Indonesia
recently stopped sharing samples with international scientists
searching for mutations, saying it wanted assurances that any
vaccines developed from its H5N1 virus strain would not be
prohibitively expensive.
Health ministry spokeswoman Lily Sulistyowati said samples were sent
to the WHO-affiliated Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta, GA, last Thursday [16 Aug 2007] to prove to the world "that
the virus has not mutated in any way ... and that Bali is still safe to visit."
