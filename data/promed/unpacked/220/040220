'No risk' after Lassa fever death
---------------------------------
Health officials have said the public are not at risk after a patient
at a London hospital died of Lassa fever. The Health Protection
Agency (HPA) said the death at University College Hospital was an
isolated case and the patient had been working in Africa. The Agency
is trying to identify members of staff or healthcare workers who
might have had contact with the patient who had been to Mali.
Patients and visitors to the hospital are not at risk, the HPA said.

Last month, a 66-year-old east London man, who had been travelling in
Nigeria, died of Lassa fever at London's Royal Free Hospital.

The fever is caused by a virus and is endemic in Nigeria, Sierra
Leone, Liberia, Guinea, and the Central African Republic. Dr Dilys
Morgan, a Lassa fever expert at the Health Protection Agency, said:
"These people will be provided with information about Lassa fever and
asked to get in contact with us should they develop any symptoms."

[Lassa fever is a zoonotic disease, whereby humans become infected
from contact with infected animals. The animal reservoirs of Lassa
virus are rodents of the genus _Mastomys_, the "multimammate rat." (A
photograph of a multimammate rat can be accessed at

Lassa virus-infected animals do not become ill, but they can shed the
virus in their urine and faeces. It can be transmitted also between humans.

Lassa fever is endemic in many countries in West Africa, but is only
rarely imported into Europe. Remarkably this is the 2nd death this
month [February 2009] of a patient in a London hospital as a result
of Lassa fever virus infection contracted in Africa. (See the ProMED
references below for more detail). A recent statement from Nigeria
suggests that currently Lassa fever virus infection appears to be on
the increase (see the ProMED-mail report: Lassa fever - Nigeria,
archived as 20090218.0669).
