Doctors have reported the 1st case of extensively drug-resistant typhoid in Australia, warning the country is not immune to the "emerging threat". A 20-month-old Australian-born girl is the 1st patient to develop the highly resistant form of the superbug after returning from a 3-month trip to Pakistan. Dr. Philip Britton and his colleagues from the Children's Hospital at Westmead and the University of Sydney published the findings in the Medical Journal of Australia letter on Monday [16 Sep 2019].

Typhoid fever is caused by an infection with the bacteria _Salmonella _ Typhi. In Australia, most typhoid infections are acquired by travelers consuming contaminated food or water overseas, particularly in endemic regions of South and South-East Asia.

Since 2016, an extensively drug-resistant (XDR) group of typhoid-related organisms, called a "clade", has emerged in Pakistan, showing resistance to 1st-line antimicrobials. A total of 7 cases of XDR have been reported among travelers -- mostly children -- returning from Pakistan to England, Germany and the USA in the past 2 years.

According to Britton and his colleagues, the young girl presented to the Sydney hospital with features of typhoid fever (also known as enteric fever) 14 months after her return to Australia. She was a previously healthy child who had received routine vaccines, with no additional pre-travel vaccinations being recommended.

"Diarrhea began in Pakistan 6 weeks before her return and continued despite the use of oral antimicrobials prescribed locally in Pakistan," the authors wrote. "10 days of high fevers, irritability, vomiting and reduced oral intake prompted admission."

Doctors grew the bug from the young girl's bloodstream, finding it showed features typical of the XDR clade. They treated the young girl with intravenous meropenem and oral azithromycin -- the last 2 remaining antimicrobials -- which she responded to, and discharged her after 8 days.

The case was one of 12 travel-associated enteric fever cases managed at the Sydney hospital between January and March this year [2019], with incidences growing between 2003 and 2015. It adds to concerns around the global rise of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, as infections that were once easy to treat with antimicrobials are becoming less so.

"As a result, standard treatments become ineffective, infections persist and may spread to others," it says.

Britton and his colleagues said Australia is not only not immune to the "escalating" threat of antimicrobial resistance but the "emerging threat" of XDR typhoid, given our tendency to travel. "Typhoid must be considered as a diagnosis for febrile returned travelers from endemic regions, including South and South‚ÄêEast Asia," they wrote.

The researchers urged travelers visiting affected regions to get vaccinated, adding typhoid is a key illness of concern between January and March -- the "peak season" for travelers returning to Australia. Typhoid vaccination is recommended from 2 years of age if travel is planned to these regions. The researchers said GPs have an important role in providing travel-related vaccine advice, adding care for returning travelers "must not be underestimated".

[It is likely that more and more cases of XDR typhoid will be exported into Europe, Australia and the USA. Prevention of acquisition in travelers depends on appropriate avoidance of potentially contaminated food and water, and immunization. - Mod.LL
