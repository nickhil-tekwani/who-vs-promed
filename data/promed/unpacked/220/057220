Wheat flag smut in Kansas first time since 1930s
------------------------------------------------
Weather conditions have been ideal for flag smut, a fungus found in the United States, but not known in Kansas since the 1930s. [In early] May 2015, it was initially detected in a field demonstration plot in Rooks County and confirmed by laboratory results during regular and on-going disease survey work. Additional surveys [are being conducted] to determine the severity and breadth of the outbreak. Of the 64 fields surveyed, only 2 presumptive positive tests have been detected.

More information about the spread of the disease will be available [soon]. Yield loss from flag smut is anticipated to be less than that caused by the stripe rust [see link below] present this year [2015]. Best management practices for farmers to prevent flag smut in the coming crop year include planting treated seed.

[Flag smut of wheat is caused by the fungus _Urocystis agropyri_. The disease is known to infect wheat and many grass species but the strain(s) that affect wheat are specific to wheat. It occurs in some European countries, Australia, Canada and the USA. Yield losses of up to 10-15 per cent have been reported, for example, in Western Australian. Even where yield losses are limited, it can have a serious impact on export trade. Many nations have quarantine restrictions prohibiting the importation of wheat products from countries with the disease.

Affected plants are severely stunted. Excessive tillering is common and often the ears fail to emerge, remaining within the boot. Plants show long dark grey to black streaks on the leaf blades and leaf sheaths. The streaks eventually erupt so leaves become ragged and the black spores are exposed giving the plant an appearance of being covered in soot. Spores are wind dispersed and can drop onto the soil where they are very persistent surviving up to 4 years. Disease management may include cultural practices, but systemic chemical seed treatment is the most effective means of controlling the disease.

Because flag smut has mostly been considered of low importance for decades, specific resistance breeding programmes do not seem to exist. Re-emergence of the disease reported from South Australia in 2008 (ProMED-mail post 20080919.2953) was attributed to farmers cutting back on seed treatments.
