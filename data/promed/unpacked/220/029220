Acceleration of the response to the epicenter of the epidemic
-------------------
On Fri 17 Aug 2018, the Minister of Health, Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, visited the teams deployed in Mangina (Mabalako Health Zone). In particular, he spoke with the additional surveillance teams sent in reinforcements who arrived since yesterday [Thu 16 Aug 2018] on site. With 2157 contacts already registered, they have a huge amount of work to do to follow up on these contacts, to continue the investigations and the active search for cases, as well as to prepare the ground for the vaccination teams.

The Minister then visited the new Mangina CTE which has a capacity of 50 beds. However, due to the rapid increase in confirmed cases, the coordination is considering the construction of a 2nd CTE in Mangina.

- Worrisome situation.
Sat 18 Aug 2018. Ebola DR Congo North Kivu and Ituri Provinces, 41 deaths now reported, health officials 'worried." 57 cases reported (30 confirmed 27 probable)
[CNN, excerpted, edited]
https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/14/health/congo-ebola-outbreak-update/index.html

Data from Tue 14 Aug 2018:

An ongoing Ebola outbreak is spreading across the Democratic Republic of Congo's North Kivu Province, and it has health officials gravely concerned due to conflict in the area along with other factors.

WHO director-general Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus visited the city of Beni and the Mangina area in North Kivu. Mangina, which is about 30 km [19 mi] from Beni, sits at the epicenter of the outbreak. "After the visit, I am actually more worried," Tedros said at a news conference on Tuesday [14 Aug 2018]. "What makes actually the outbreak in eastern DRC or northern Kivu more dangerous is that there is a security challenge. There is active conflict in that area. Since January [2018], there were 120 violent incidences," he said.

Thousands in the region have been displaced by fighting between rebel groups and government forces.

"That environment is really conducive for Ebola actually to transmit freely, because in that area, there are places called red zones, inaccessible areas, because there are many armed groups that operate in that region or in that province," he said.

In other words, those areas remain difficult to access, and people may have difficulty getting healthcare and support. Also, he added, many cases are among women and children.

"There are other factors that complicate the issue. One is high population density," Tedros said.

North Kivu is among Congo's most populated provinces, with 8 million inhabitants, according to WHO and the UN. Its capital is the city of Goma. The region has been experiencing intense insecurity and a worsening humanitarian crisis, with over 1 million internally displaced people and a continuous outflow of refugees to neighboring countries, including Uganda, Burundi, and Tanzania.

"The other worrisome problem, especially in Mangina, is the number of health workers that are already infected with Ebola, and we have, so far, 7 [now 10 - Mod.LK] cases," Tedros said.

Vaccination efforts have begun in high-risk areas of North Kivu. The provincial health minister and the provincial coordinator of the WHO Expanded Programme on Immunization were the 1st to be vaccinated, according to WHO. They were followed by 1st-line health workers from the Mangina health center, who had been in contact with confirmed Ebola cases.

The vaccine is being administered using a ring vaccination strategy, in which groups of people who were in close contact with each Ebola case, as well as the contacts of those contacts, get vaccinated. Yet Tedros said Tuesday [14 Aug 2018] that a proposal to conduct more widespread vaccinations among people in Mangina, whether they are contacts or not, has been under consideration.

"In the typical ways to contain these types of outbreaks, you want to identify the patients very quickly. You want to make sure that people who are feverish and have the disease do not leave an area," Don Sodora, a virologist at the Center for Infectious Disease Research, told CNN when the previous outbreak was declared over in July [2018]. "The hemorrhagic fever viruses have a number of issues that make them particularly problematic with regard to transmission. They have this initial period when people are infected but don't show symptoms, and that's a problem," he said, adding that once people are infected, they are extremely contagious. "So the best strategy is to identify infected people, get there rapidly with trained healthcare workers, and get quarantine established quickly," he said. "That is the major lesson we have learned."

[2] Response
- Sat 18 Aug 2018. CDC Travel advice: Ebola in Democratic Republic of the Congo
[CDC Travel Notices, excerpted, edited]
http://bit.ly/2nPg2yU

Key Points
- There is an outbreak of Ebola in North Kivu (Kivu Nord) Province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
- The outbreak is in a part of the country identified by the US State Department as a "reconsider travel" zone due to armed group activity and major outbreaks of violence targeting civilians.
-Travelers to this area could be infected if they come into contact with an infected person's blood or body fluids.
- Travelers should seek medical care immediately if they develop symptoms of fever, headache, body aches, sore throat, diarrhea, vomiting, stomach pain, rash, or red eyes during or after travel.

Who is at risk?
- The risk to most travelers to DRC is low. Travelers could be infected if they come into contact with infected blood or body fluids. Family and friends caring for people with Ebola, and healthcare workers who do not use correct infection control precautions, are at highest risk.

What can travelers do to protect themselves?
There is no FDA-approved or widely available vaccine or specific treatment for Ebola, and many people who get the disease die. Therefore, it is important to take steps to prevent Ebola.
- Take steps to prevent infection.
- Pay attention to your health during travel and for 21 days after you leave DRC.
- Before you go to a doctor's office or emergency room, tell the doctor about your recent travel and your symptoms.
- Although the risk for Ebola is low in travelers to DRC, other infectious disease risks remain high, including the risk for malaria.
- Register with the US Department of State.

What can travelers do to protect others when leaving DRC?
- Travelers who may have been exposed to Ebola or who become sick during travel should postpone further international travel and get immediate medical attention. Any person with possible exposure or Ebola-like symptoms will not be allowed to travel unless the travel is part of an appropriate medical evacuation.

Special recommendations for healthcare workers in the outbreak area
- Practice proper infection control and sterilization measures. For more information, see "Infection control for viral haemorrhagic fevers in the African healthcare setting."

http://www.who.int/csr/don/17-august-2018-ebola-drc/en/

Excerpts:
- As of [Wed 15 Aug 2018], WHO has deployed over 100 technical and logistics specialists to support response activities. Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) partner institutions continue to support the response as well as ongoing readiness and preparedness activities in non-affected provinces of the DRC and in bordering countries. For more information about operational readiness and preparedness activities, please see the DON [Disease Outbreak News] published on 14 Aug 2018.

- In addition to the mobile laboratory established in Beni on 3 Aug 2018, local testing with Xpert Ebola has since been established in hospital facilities in Beni, Goma, and Mangina to facilitate the timely diagnosis of suspected cases.

- The MoH team, with support from UNICEF, are training 90 psychosocial agents to provide psychosocial care to patients and other affected people.

- Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) surveys were conducted in Beni and Mabalako health zones to assess the levels of EVD awareness in the communities. Findings from the survey will be used to improve the risk communication, social mobilization, and community engagement strategy.

- Two planes with supplies of cold-chain equipment, isolation units, and vehicles arrived in Beni on 11 and 12 Aug [2018].

- Fri 17 Aug 2018. Militia threat hampers Ebola fight in Congo as disease kills 47.
[Reuters, edited]
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-ebola-who/militia-threat-hampers-ebola-fight-in-congo-as-disease-kills-47-idUSKBN1L20VB

Militia violence in Democratic Republic of Congo has prevented aid workers from reaching some potential cases in an outbreak of Ebola that has so far killed 47 people, the World Health Organization said on Fri [17 Aug 2018].

Over 2000 people have been potentially exposed to the virus that began in North Kivu province, but the violence means officials cannot be sure if they have identified all the chains by which it is spreading in the east of the vast country.

"We don't know if we are having all transmission chains identified. We expect to see more cases as a result of earlier infections and these infections developing into illness," WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told a news briefing in Geneva. "The worst-case scenario is that we have these security blind spots where the epidemic could take hold that we don't know about," he added.

Congo's Health Ministry said confirmed and probable cases numbered 87 in total, including 47 deaths. About 2150 people have been identified as contacts of people infected with the disease, which causes fever, vomiting and diarrhea.

Health workers "have a huge amount of work to do to follow up on these contacts, to continue the investigations and the active search for cases, as well as to prepare the ground for the vaccination teams," the ministry said in a statement late on Friday [17 Aug 2018].

The outbreak is spreading across the lush farmlands of eastern Congo. Its epicenter is the town of Mangina in North Kivu Province, and it has already reached neighboring Ituri Province.

The WHO said more than 500 people including health workers have been vaccinated against the disease. It had deployed more than 100 experts to Mangina and Beni towns to oversee tracing, vaccination, and safe burials.

There were, however, "red zones" near Mangina that aid workers could not enter for security reasons, Jasarevic said.

- Fri 17 Aug 2018. Children particularly affected by the Ebola outbreak in the DRC
[UNICEF, edited]
https://www.unicef.org/wca/press-releases/children-particularly-affected-ebola-outbreak-drc-unicef

Children represent an unusually high proportion of people affected by the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), UNICEF said today.

Two children have already died from the disease. The Ebola treatment centres in Beni and Mangina are currently treating 6 children that are infected by the disease or suspected to be. UNICEF has identified 53 orphaned children who have lost their parents to Ebola.

"The children affected by the ongoing epidemic need special attention and care," said Dr. Gianfranco Rotigliano, UNICEF representative in the DRC. "Women are the primary caregivers for children, so if they are infected with the disease, there is a greater risk that children and families become vulnerable."

The UN children's agency and its partners have trained 88 psychosocial workers to assist and comfort children in centres and to support children who have been discharged as free of Ebola, but may be at risk of stigmatization within the community. The psychosocial workers organize awareness-raising activities to facilitate the return of these children to their communities.

"The impact of the disease on children is not limited to those who have been infected or suspected," said Rotigliano. "Many children are faced with the illness or death of their parents and loved ones, while some children have lost large parts of their families and become isolated. These children urgently need our support".

The organisation seeks and supports foster families for these children and also provides them with psychosocial care and food assistance.

[The trauma of the ongoing violence alone would be more than enough stress for any person, let alone a child; but to add Ebola on top of this is almost more than anyone can imagine. These children need a lot of love and support, both physically and emotionally. It is good that UNICEF is there for them, and the community as well. - Mod.LK]

[3] Bat pathogens (review)
- Sat 18 Aug 2018. Bat pathogens hit the road: But which one?
[PLOS Pathog, excerpted, edited]
http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1007134

Citation: Joffrin L, Dietrich M, Mavingui P, Lebarbenchon C. Bat pathogens hit the road: But which one? PLOS Pathog. 2018; 14(8): e1007134. doi: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007134

Excerpt: Current evidence suggests that environmental changes and interactions between wildlife, livestock, and humans contribute to the spillover of infectious agents from bats to other hosts [1]. An increasing number of studies investigating the diversity and infection dynamics of bat pathogens has recently been published; however, how these infectious agents are transmitted both within bat populations and to other hosts, including humans, often remains unknown. Here, we summarize current knowledge on direct and indirect transmission routes of bat infectious agents of public health concern (Fig 1). Although bats are recognized as major reservoir hosts of emerging infectious diseases, we highlight that a significant knowledge gap on transmission mechanisms remains and needs further exploration.
