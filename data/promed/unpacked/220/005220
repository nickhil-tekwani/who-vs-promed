Ebola Fever Surveillance at Kenya-Uganda Border
-----------------------------------------------
More than 25 000 people have been screened for Ebola virus infection at all
[Kenya-Uganda border towns, the Director of Medical Services, Dr. Richard
Muga, said yesterday. Dr. Muga dispelled rumors that there was an outbreak
of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in [Kenya. He said village health committees
will be formed in border districts to assist medical personnel in
monitoring the disease and identifying people who enter Kenya using panya
(illegal) routes. Dr. Muga was speaking at Busia District Hospital, where
he led a team of senior health officials on a tour of the border town to
check on the precautionary measures taken against the spread of the disease
and to allay fears of an [impending Ebola fever outbreak. He said
surveillance teams were at all border towns to ensure that all cross-border
traffic was thoroughly screened. "I urge Kenyans who have relatives in
Uganda to avoid attending their burials until the disease is under
control," he said.
Dr. Muga said 11 people quarantined at Busia District Hospital had attended
their relatives' funerals in Gulu, where the disease has killed more than
100 people. "The people do not have Ebola fever but because they were at
Gulu, we have taken their blood samples for testing and that is why we have
confined them," said Dr Muga. [Those under observation are 3 men, 4 women
and 4 children. These suspects were rounded up in Nambale, Mt. Elgon and
Kitale. - Mod.CP
