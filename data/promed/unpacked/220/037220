Two new polio cases in Lakki Marwat, 1 in Harnai bring total to 76 this year [2019]
-----------------
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Lakki Marwat district on Sunday [20 Oct 2019] reported 2 new cases of polio and Balochistan's Harnai district reported 1, bringing the country's total this year [2019] to 76.

The 2 victims from Lakki Marwat -- a 7-year-old girl and a 21-month-old boy -- are residents of the Sarai Naurang tehsil, a report released by the Emergency Operation Centre said.

According to the EOC, both affected children had not been administered the polio vaccine.

The presence of a polio virus in their systems was confirmed via a stool test. The total number of cases across the province now number 56.

The EOC report cited "refusals by parents" as the top reason for the scale of the virus' resurgence witnessed this year [2019].

EOC Coordinator Abdul Basit said that the polio drops "are completely safe" and urged parents to pay no heed to the "misleading propaganda" aimed at discouraging the administering of the drops.

He said that despite the challenges being faced, the government is determined to continue its fight for the complete eradication of polio. For this, reaching each and every child is compulsory, said Basit. "And cooperation from parents and all sections of society is mandatory."

In Balochistan, the victim is an 11-month-old boy from the district Harnai, who "developed a fever on [25 Sep 2019]," a report from the province's EOC said. The boy was taken to a medical store at Shahrug Harnai, where he was "given an I/M injection," said the report. "As the condition of the child did not improve, he was taken to another informal healthcare provider, where he was given medication," it added. The report further said that on the morning of [27 Sep 2019], the child "developed weakness initially in the left leg followed by the right leg" and was taken to the Saeed Hospital in Kuchlak, Quetta, where he was administered antibiotics intravenously. "As the condition still did not improve, he was taken to Tariq Clinic in Kuchlak, Quetta on [2 Oct 2019], where he was reported as an AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) case," according to the EOC report.

The child had been immunised once during a routine drive. However, the family was constantly on the move between Ziarat and Harnai, the EOC observed in its report.

A province-wide break down of cases as of [20 Oct 2019] is given below:

Total polio cases in Pakistan (2019) = 76

[Comparing the district specific list of cases presented in the above media report with that available on the End Polio Pakistan website, which is current since last week's global update (showing a total of 72 cases (see http://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-district-wise-2019), there are 5 cases listed in the above newswire which do not reconcile with the official information. Clarification from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated.

The story of the child developing paralysis after an intramuscular injection brought to mind the discussions on "provocation poliomyelitis." Borrowing from my previous moderator comment (see Poliomyelitis update (77): Pakistan (SD, PB, KP) 20190929.6700783): "Through the years, there have been observations and theories about "provocation poliomyelitis" where paralysis is "provoked" by trauma when an individual is infected with a poliovirus. A major concern was the receipt of intramuscular injections during the incubation period. Gromeier and Wimmer studied this in an animal model and observed that "Skeletal muscle injury induces retrograde axonal transport of poliovirus and thereby facilitates viral invasion of the central nervous system and the progression of spinal cord damage." Strebel et al did a case control study of vaccine associated polio cases in Romania and demonstrated that the same phenomenon was observed and associated with intramuscular injections within 30 days of receipt of oral poliovirus vaccine.

Given the continued fairly widespread circulation of the WPV in Pakistan, it might seem prudent for clinicians to avoid giving IM injections to children presenting with "viral syndrome-like symptoms," as those symptoms may be due to poliovirus infection. - Mod.MPP]

[While the weekly report seems promising, with no newly confirmed poliovirus (WPV or cVDPV) associated paralytic cases, the media report above demonstrates that circulation/transmission of the WPV has not as yet been interrupted in Pakistan.

And, while there are no new cases of cVDPV associated paralysis, the persistently positive environmental sampling in the Manila metro area in the Philippines is of concern as well.

As done in previous posts, to visualize all of this activity, I am putting links to HealthMap/ProMED-mail maps of countries with poliovirus activity during the past 12 months below. The size of the list remains impressive, now with 20 countries: 12 in Africa, 5 in Asia, and 3 in the Western Pacific.
