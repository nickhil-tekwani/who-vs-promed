The mysterious death of thousands of birds on a lake on the outskirts of
Greece's 2nd city, Salonika, was due to a botulism outbreak, wildlife
experts said Thursday [30 Sep 2004].
According to officials of the Greek Ornithological Society, an analysis
conducted by British labs showed the birds were killed by _Clostridium
botulinum_, the spore-forming rod[-shaped bacillus] that produces the
potent neurotoxin which causes botulism.
The finding supports the suspicions of local officials that the outbreak at
Lake Koronia was caused by extensive draining of the lake for farming
purposes as _Clostridium botulinum_ develops in stagnant or polluted waters.
Despite the fact that it is supposedly protected as wildlife area, Lake
Koronia has lost 1/3 of its surface in the last 30 years.
Ingestion of the botulism neurotoxin has a high mortality rate for humans
if not treated immediately. Wild water fowl and some fish are also known to
be affected. [see comment below].
At least 4500 birds and 1000 fish are known to have died at the lake,
paralysed by the substance. 29 species of birds, including several
protected ones, were hit. The dead include some 150 pelicans as well as
gulls and ducks.
Officials have stopped the deaths by scaring away birds that try to
approach Koronia. Heavy rainfall in recent days added fresh water to the
lake and helped dissolve [dilute?] the toxin, Salonika deputy prefect
Yiannis Bikos told AFP.

[In the original news item, it was stated that "no dead fish have been
found". The current news item includes different information. The
difference, if confirmed, is of significance.
Botulism in waterfowl is generally caused by one of 2 toxin types. Type E
toxin is found primarily in decaying fish and causes intoxication in those
feeding on them. It may also cause intoxication in humans.
Type C toxin, on the other hand, is not related to fish. It occurs in
carcasses of dead invertebrates, in the flesh of birds dying of botulism,
and in maggots feeding on toxic carcasses. Type C, which is regarded as
responsible for most outbreaks in water-fowl world-wide, does not pose a
risk to humans.
Clearly, an identification of the causative toxin in the Greek outbreak is
urgently needed. - Mod.AS]
