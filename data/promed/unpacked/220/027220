Multistate outbreak of _Salmonella_ infections linked to imported Maradol papayas
----------------------------------------------------------------------
CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the Food and Drug Administration are investigating a multistate outbreak of salmonellosis. This outbreak includes 4 different types of salmonellae: Thompson, Kiambu, Agona, and Gaminara. The same strain of these types of _Salmonella_ were found in samples collected from papayas and from ill people.

A total of 201 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ Thompson (131), _S._ Kiambu (57), _S._ Agona (8), or _S._ Gaminara (5) have been reported from 23 states.

65 ill people have been hospitalized. One death was reported from New York City.

Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicates that Maradol papayas from the Carica de Campeche farm in Mexico are the likely source of this multistate outbreak. 2 additional outbreaks of salmonellosis linked to imported papayas from 2 other farms in Mexico, Caraveo Produce and El Zapotanito, have been identified. Available information indicates that illnesses in these 2 outbreaks are not linked to papayas from the Carica de Campeche farm and are being investigated separately.

CDC recommends that consumers not eat, restaurants not serve, and retailers not sell Maradol papayas from the Carica de Campeche, Caraveo Produce, or El Zapotanito farms in Mexico.

If you aren't sure if the papaya you bought is a Maradol papaya from one of these farms, ask the place of purchase. Restaurants and retailers can ask their suppliers. When in doubt, don't eat, sell, or serve papayas; just throw them out.

Wash and sanitize countertops as well as drawers or shelves in refrigerators where Maradol papayas were stored.

Because three separate outbreaks linked to papayas from different farms have been identified, CDC is concerned that papayas from several other farms in Mexico might be contaminated with _Salmonella_ and have made people sick.

FDA continues testing papayas from Mexico to see if other papayas from other farms are contaminated with _Salmonella_. Investigations are ongoing to determine if additional consumer warnings are needed beyond the advice not to eat papayas from specific farms that is given in this update. CDC will provide updates when more information is available.

[The outbreak's epicurve (https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/kiambu-07-17/epi.html) clearly shows the change in serotype cases over time; the 1st 5 weeks of the cluster of salmonellosis were almost all serotype Kiambu with sporadic cases after that, the next 3 weeks were mostly related to serotype Thompson, and now there is a mixture of the different serotypes. - Mod.LL
