Belarus has imposed temporary restrictions on transit and import of cattle from Hungary, BelTA learnt from the Veterinary and Food Supervisory Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food.

The animals seropositive to Schmallenberg virus [SBV] were detected in Hungary, the department informed. In this connection, Belarus has imposed temporary restrictions on transit and import of cattle and genetic material retrieved from the specified species from Hungary to the country.

Schmallenberg virus is in the Simbu serogroup of the _Orthobunyavirus_ group. This group of viruses includes many different viruses, which occur in Asia, Africa, and Australia, but have not previously been identified in Europe. Orthobunyaviruses are typically primarily spread by biting insect vectors, such as midges and mosquitoes, although the routes of SBV transmission have not yet been confirmed. The potential for direct transmission (that is, direct from one animal to another) is therefore, as yet, unknown. Currently it is known that the virus can infect and cause disease in sheep, cattle, and goats.

[According to a Hungarian news agency, cited by FluTrackers, only one SBV case has been observed in Hungary; further information is, reportedly, due on Monday (7 Jan 2013). See (in Hungarian) at http://gazdasag.ma.hu/tart/cikk/c/0/156572/1/gazdasag/VM_Magyarorszagon_egyetlen_kerodzo_allatnal_eszleltek_megbetegedest.

At present, the case is regarded as 'suspected', in anticipation of confirmation or otherwise.

Since the end of May 2012, SBV-infected countries have discontinued reporting SBV to OIE's WAHID system as an emerging disease; their information should be sought elsewhere. During June-December 2012, SBV has been detected in several additional European countries (see references in the "see also" section, below), including cattle exporters. For background to the new reporting policy, see articles 240-245 of the Final Report, OIE's 80th General Session, Paris, 20-25 May 2012:

"240. The Delegate of Denmark, speaking on behalf of the 27 EU Member Countries, congratulated the Scientific Commission for the work done on Schmallenberg virus (SBV) and expressed the wish of the EU countries to continue to participate in future work in the area. He welcomed the conclusions of the OIE ad hoc Group on SBV, in particular the absence of a zoonotic risk, the very low impact on livestock with less than 4000 cases in pregnant ruminants out of 125 million ruminants in 8 affected Member States of the EU, and the negligible risk presented by the major commodities. The recent evolution of the infection indicated that SBV should no longer be considered as an emerging disease in Western Europe. The EU had taken a transparent approach by notifying outbreaks to the OIE and invited OIE Member Countries to act in a similar manner should similar situations occur in future. He called on OIE Member Countries to take due account of these conclusions and not to impose scientifically unjustified trade restrictions, given that no trade-restrictive measures were applied to other viruses of the Simbu Group.

241. The Delegate of Canada expressed his appreciation of the high level of the scientific work conducted by Prof. Mettenleiter and his team. He welcomed the spirit of collaboration and willingness to share the samples, materials, and scientific results between countries to ensure accurate and timely diagnosis.

242. The Delegate of Australia wondered how the infection was likely to evolve in the next vector-active period. Prof. Mettenleiter answered that the epidemiology of the disease was not yet sufficiently understood to speculate on this and stressed the need to pursue collection of relevant data.

243. The Delegate of Brazil requested the scientific evidence for not imposing trade restrictions on semen and embryos. Prof. Mettenleiter replied that the very short duration of viraemia and rapidly acquired immunity were the 2 main arguments against the need for trade restriction. He invited Delegates to defer to the recently updated OIE factsheet, available on the OIE website, for more detailed information.

244. The Director General thanked all the countries affected by SBV for notifying infections, in a timely manner, as an emerging disease. After end of May 2012, affected Member Countries that so desired could send a final report and consider the disease endemic. The information published by the OIE on the safe trade of commodities and animals would be further updated as more information became available. More scientific research was needed on SBV and other viruses in the same family found in other countries of the world. He reminded the Assembly that revised criteria for the listing of diseases were being presented for adoption at the present General Session, indicating that this disease would not be eligible for the listing according to these revised criteria. He also pointed out that the Scientific Commission, based on its knowledge of the situation, confirmed the negligible risk posed by meat, milk, semen, and embryos.

245. The Assembly adopted the Report of the Scientific Commission."

The above, as well as additional information on SBV reporting and discussions during the General Session, as well as a link to the OIE SBV factsheet, are available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/About_us/docs/pdf/A_FR_2012_Public.pdf.

New studies in Germany, Netherlands, and France have indicated that, potentially, possible dissemination of SBV with bovine semen can presently not be excluded (see ProMED-mail postings 20121220.1460864 and 20121221.1462748). - Mod.AS]
