The Assam forest department has initiated urgent measures to check the outbreak of anthrax after one of the 2 feral buffaloes found dead inside the Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary (PWS) tested positive for infection, officials said.

The wildlife sanctuary in Morigaon district is also home to more than 100 endangered one-horned rhinoceros.

Jitendra Kumar, Divisional Forest Officer, Wildlife, Guwahati said that the veterinarians have confirmed anthrax as the cause of death of the feral buffaloes whose carcasses were found on [Wed 16 Oct 2019]. Parikshit Kakoti, senior programme officer veterinary, WWF [World Wildlife Fund] India, said he found dark red, blackish blood oozing out of the nostrils of one of the 2 buffalo carcasses found within a distance of 100 metres [328 ft] from each other when he arrived at the spot on [Thu 17 Oct 2019] leading to the suspicion that it could be anthrax. The other carcass was already decomposed, he explained. "The sample was sent to 2 labs including the North Eastern Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory and the College of Veterinary Science. Both the reports on [Sat 19 Oct 2019] note anthrax as the provisional diagnosis," Kakoti said adding that the same infection is likely to have caused the death of the 2nd buffalo.

Around 102 rhinos of the PWS, as per the 2018 census, inhabit just a 16 square kilometer [about 6.2 sq mi] area of the 38 square kilometers [about 14.7 sq mi] that forms the wildlife sanctuary. Kumar said the carcasses were found in the area inhabited by the rhinos.

Since anthrax was being suspected as the cause of death, the carcasses were given a deep burial even as officials tried to disinfect with lime and formaldehyde. The area has also been cordoned off. "An electric fence, a total of one kilometer [0.62 mi] in periphery will be erected around the spot to keep other animals away," Kumar said.

Meanwhile, the 10 domesticated elephants and a calf which are used for safaris have also been vaccinated, according to Kumar even as the state's Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Directorate have issued an advisory and initiated measures to start vaccination of domestic livestock in the peripheral villages. The personnel who dealt with the carcasses are on a 10-day preventive antibiotic drug regime.

"We are taking all possible measures to ensure this is checked and does not spread. All animals are susceptible to infection," said Paresh Sarma, Deputy Director, Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Directorate.

Anthrax, an infectious disease which primarily afflicts herbivores particularly cattle, sheep, and horses, can be transferred from animals to humans. Anthrax spores can persist in soil for many years.

Sarma said as many as 7 buffaloes died in Kamrup district due to anthrax in 2018 but this is the 1st instance in 2019. He also explained anthrax is rare in protected areas. In 2016, in the Kaziranga National Park there was suspicion that seven Asiatic wild buffaloes have died due to anthrax. But the tests were negative.

"Floods may have brought the infection to PWS," Sarma said.

[Anthrax is infrequently reported in Assam. Bovine outbreaks occurred in Assam in 2000 and in a rhinoceros in 2008.

The question remains: Where did this buffalo infection originate? In the absence of prior cases one might suspect it is going unreported in domestic animals in a district adjoining Morigaon and the Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary. For a description of the sanctuary and its location, go to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pobitora_Wildlife_Sanctuary. The sanctuary is also close to the northern border of Bangladesh and its problems; see: http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/india_physio-2001.jpg. - Mod.MHJ
