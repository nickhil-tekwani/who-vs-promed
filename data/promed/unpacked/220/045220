The moderator stated "Unless the vaccine virus has undergone an
unprecedented increase in virulence during the manufacturing process, the
most likely explanation for the tragic deaths from the vaccine is that the
victims were immunosuppressed, either as a result of an underlying
infection such as HIV, or from a course of treatment for another condition."
There need not be a reversion to virulence or a compromised immune system.
The USA has given up primary vaccination with oral polio vaccine because of
the rare occurrence of paralytic disease following vaccination of a non
immune person or contact spread to a non immune person. It is only after
large numbers of persons were vaccinated that this was observed.
Guillan-Barre Syndrome following immunization with vaccine prepared from
H1N1-New Jersey (the swine influenza strain of 1976) was only recognized
after close to 40 million people were immunized. I know, I was there for
both.
