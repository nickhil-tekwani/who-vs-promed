The [African] swine fever [ASF] virus is closer than ever to the Luxembourg border. The "viropositive" carcass of an infected wild boar was discovered just 3 km [1.9 mi] from the country.

The animal was found a few days ago in the village of Differt, located in the municipality of Messancy in Belgium, according to our colleagues from the Meuse Luxembourg. [The location is] just 10 minutes from Clemency, a Luxembourg town. Wild boars taken by fever usually seek water points: Differt is a village bordered by the river Messancy, which inevitably attracts mammals.

Swine fever has already killed more than 550 animals in Belgium. On 15 Feb 2019, minister of agriculture Romain Schneider and environment minister Carole Dieschbourg said they were optimistic that the virus could avoid Luxembourg.

A surveillance zone has been set up in the southwest of the country, between the A4 and A6 motorways, close to the Belgian and French borders.

African swine fever causes the death of infected animals in a few days. In humans, however, the virus is harmless.
