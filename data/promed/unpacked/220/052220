Multistate Outbreak of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium Linked to Chicken Salad
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) are investigating a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium infections.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on _Salmonella_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives a more detailed DNA fingerprint than PFGE.

As of 21 Feb 2018, 65 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium have been reported from 5 states. WGS performed on bacterial isolates from ill people showed that they were closely relatedly genetically. This means that people in this outbreak are more likely to share a common source of infection.

States Case Count
-----------------
Illinois / 4
Iowa / 55
Minnesota / 2
Nebraska / 3
Texas / 1
Total / 65

Illnesses reported by investigators in Iowa also included ill people who reported eating chicken salad from a Fareway store and who had a diagnostic test showing they were infected with _Salmonella_ bacteria. CDC is not including these people in the outbreak case count until DNA fingerprinting can link their illnesses to the outbreak. Some people may not be included because no bacterial isolates are available for DNA fingerprinting.

Illnesses started on dates ranging from [Mon 8 Jan 2018 to Wed 10 Feb 2018]. Ill people range in age from 11 to 89 years, with a median age of 57. Up to 42 people are female. A total of 28 hospitalizations have been reported. No deaths have been reported.

WGS analysis did not identify predicted antibiotic resistance in 19 isolates from 20 ill people. One isolate contained a gene for resistance to tetracycline, an antimicrobial which is not commonly used to treat patients with salmonellosis. Testing of outbreak isolates using standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods is currently underway in CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory.

Investigation of the Outbreak
-----------------------------
Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicates that chicken salad produced by Triple T Specialty Meats, Inc. and sold at Fareway grocery stores is the likely source of this multistate outbreak.

Public health officials in Iowa first detected this outbreak and linked the illnesses to chicken salad sold at Fareway grocery stores. CDC searched the PulseNet database and identified illnesses in other states, and those illnesses have been added to this outbreak. In interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. Forty-five (78 percent) of 58 people interviewed reported eating chicken salad from Fareway stores. Triple T Specialty Meats, Inc. produced the chicken salad that ill people reported eating. Public health officials continue to interview ill people in other states to learn more about what they ate in the week before becoming sick.

On [Fri 9 Feb 2018], Fareway stopped selling chicken salad in all of its stores after the Iowa Department of Inspections and Appeals contacted the company about the illnesses. Iowa Department of Public Health and the Iowa Department of Inspections and Appeals then issued a consumer advisory on [Tue 13 Feb 2018] warning that chicken salad sold at Fareway may be contaminated with _Salmonella_.

Investigators in Iowa collected chicken salad from 2 Fareway grocery store locations in Iowa for laboratory testing. The outbreak strain of _S._ Typhimurium was identified in both samples.

On [Wed 21 Feb 2018], Triple T Specialty Meats, Inc. recalled all chicken salad produced from [Tue 2 Jan 2018 to Wed 7 Feb 2018]. The recalled chicken salad was sold in containers of various weights from the deli at Fareway grocery stores in Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska, and South Dakota from [Thu 4 Jan to Fri 9 Feb 2018]. CDC recommends that people do not eat recalled chicken salad. Throw it away or return it to the place of purchase. This investigation is ongoing and we will provide updates when more information is available.

Chicken salad tainted with [_Salmonella_] bacteria has been linked to 115 sicknesses in Iowa, and the north-central Iowa plant that made the salad is being investigated, officials said [Tue 20 Feb 2018.

The chicken salad was sold by Fareway grocery stores, which pulled the product from shelves [Fri 9 Feb 2018]. The Iowa Department of Public Health said [Tue 20 Feb 2018] that 38 Iowans had confirmed cases of salmonellosis related to the outbreak, and another 78 had probable cases of it. Several other illnesses were reported in neighboring states.

The state Department of Inspections and Appeals said that the chicken salad was prepared by Triple T Specialty Meats in Ackley, which made the product solely for Fareway stores. A representative of the Ackley company said that the plant was not currently in production, but he declined to comment further.

Patricia Quinlisk, medical director for the Iowa Department of Public Health, said about 20 Iowans have been hospitalized because of the recent salmonella outbreak. Quinlisk said she had not heard of any related deaths. She added that experts believe only about 10 percent of salmonellosis cases are reported because most people don't become ill enough to see a doctor or to be tested for the bacteria.

David Werning, a spokesman for the inspections department, said the Iowa Department of Public Health uncovered the outbreak after noticing a spike in salmonella cases being reported. State experts interviewed patients about what they'd eaten in the previous 2 weeks, and they narrowed the likely culprit down to chicken salad sold by Fareway. The supermarket chain, based in Boone, acted quickly to pull the product from shelves and to help inspectors pinpoint the root of the problem, Werning said. "They've been very, very cooperative," he said.

Werning said the U.S. Department of Agriculture oversees chicken processing at the Ackley plant, but the Iowa Department of Inspections and Appeals oversees the processing of crab salad there on contract for the FDA. State inspectors went to the plant last week [week of Sun 11 Feb 2018] and found no obvious problems, a report shows.

The Fareway chain, based in Boone, has 118 stores in Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska and South Dakota. In a statement last week [week of Sun 11 Feb 2018], Fareway leaders urged customers to discard any remaining chicken salad and to contact their local store for a refund. The company said it was taking the situation seriously. "This product is not produced at any Fareway location," the company said. "At this time, based on our full cooperation with the appropriate parties, correspondence and investigation, we believe that this incident is not the result of anything done by Fareway. We also have no reason to believe this involves any other products."

[Victim R] and [Victim H] are seeking unspecified compensation for medical costs and for "great physical and mental pain and suffering, emotional distress and loss of enjoyment of life." Their lawsuits were filed by Ryan Osterholm, a Minneapolis attorney who specializes in food-poisoning cases. Osterholm said [Tue 20 Feb 2018] that he was considering filing similar lawsuits on behalf of 8 other Fareway customers, and he continues to receive more inquiries.
