With regard to the comment on the actual number of cases of dengue in
Ecuador, having served in Colombia from 1994 to 1996 as consultant for the
Colombian Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP), I learned that a
tremendous under-reporting of the febrile undifferentiated syndrome caused
by dengue viruses is a well-known fact. I would not be surprised that 2
million cases of dengue may have occurred in Ecuador since 1988.
Field investigations undertaken by our FETP colleagues documented the
disease burden of classic dengue in Colombia: for instance, in Ibague
(400,000 inhabitants), capital of Tolima State, an outbreak of dengue-2
occurred in 1995-1996, with an attack rate of 15%, causing an estimated
57,600 cases, of which only 69.4% reportedly sought medical care.
However, during the same period only 1,164 cases were reported to the
Ministry of Health (70% - EIA IgM confirmed). [EIA = enzyme-linked
immuno-assay; IgM = immunoglobulin class M, indicating recent infection
- Mod.JW
It was not until the Colombian FETP and the National Institute
of Health put more effort into collaborating with the local public health
workers and public health laboratory that two isolates of dengue-2
were obtained from patients visiting emergency rooms. More disturbing,
however, was to learn from our field investigations that none of the
[reported hemorrhagic dengue cases filled the case definition.
We discussed the
situation with local health authorities and the local medical staff, but
still a few cases were misreported as hemorrhagic dengue. Too many
unwarranted requests for platelet counts were being made.
In collaboration with the MOH epidemiologists, Drs. Margarita Ronderos and
Martha Valencia, a review of the dengue situation in Colombia was put
together and published in the second issue of the National Biweekly
Epidemiological Bulletin, IQEN, (formerly IQCB). Perhaps PAHO may help us
to distribute a copy of that issue to other Latin American countries.
One of the most striking features in the issue are the maps showing the
comeback of _Aedes aegypti_ from 1949 to 1995. The geographic extent of the
vector is even greater than before eradication. The report indicates,
based on entomological surveys, that many cities and towns have _Aedes_ spp.
household indexes between 30-40%. The editorial points to lack of
long-term commitment to explain this case of the "failure of success".
