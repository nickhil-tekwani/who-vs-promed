The brainstem encephalitis and neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE) related to
enterovirus 71 infection claimed the lives of more than 30 children in
Malaysia and 3 in Osaka, 1997, and more than 50 children in Taiwan 1998.
Recently we successfully treated another 5 year old boy with NPE and
brainstem encephalitis. He developed fever 2 days after his younger brother
who was suffered from herpangina. After 3 days he was admitted to other
hospital because of poor intake and mild dehydration. Three hours after
admission he suddenly developed profound respiratory difficulty and
transferred to our ICU in the Osaka City General Hospital. Chest Xp, CT and
bloody foamy secretion revealed the cause of dyspnea was pulmonary edema.
Echocardiography showed poor left ventricular contraction and he was in
shock. After the internal jugular vein and internal carotid artery were
canulated, Extracoporeal Lung Support(VA-ECLS or ECMO) was started and
edema fluid was diminished the next day. CSF pleocytosis(33/mm3) was found.
ECLS was discontinued after 2 days and he was alert. But extubation trial
failed three times because of poor cough activity and low lung capacity. At
last he was extubated successfully,10 days after admission. Left
ventricular ejection fraction was 0.2 on admission and was improved
gradually to 0.5 after 7days. MRI revealed relatively small lesions in
dorsal area of pont-medullary junction.
We consider that NPE associated with brainstem encephalitis is due to
increased permeability of pulmonary capillary vessels and [that depressed
cardiac function is secondary to shock, [such as occurs in hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome [HPS. In HPS, pulmonary edema is suggested to be
created by cytokines such as TNF alfa and INF gamma, which [are induced by
hantavirus infection of lung. Also in HPS, left heart failure was noticed
by reduced ejection fraction in ECHO cardiography or hemodynamic study by
Swan-Ganz catheter but pathological study revealed hantavirus infection of
cardiac muscle was [low. HPS was rescued by few days ECLS. [? Virological
study was in progess [?
We think that severe permeability pulmonary edema was accompanied by
secondary left ventricular dysfunction and complete recovery of heart is
expected after pulmonary and cardiac support by ECLS. We also consider
pulmonary edema associated with brainstem encephalitis is non-cardiogenic
because the absence of cardiac enlargement and arrhythmia and complete
recovery of cardiac function after few days [argues against acute
myocarditis theory.
The patient has now reached 4 weeks after admission and has only mild
bulbar palsy (mild dysphagia and hoarseness).
We also suggest this unique syndrome includes enterovirus infection of
brainstem and fulminant pulmonary edema, perhaps treatable with short-term
ECLS.

[We were asked by Dr. Shiomi to edit the message he sent. I hope that in
doing so I did not change the meaning. Words and comments in brackets are
mine alone and are errors my responsibility.
The bottom line here is that ECLS might be useful in treating a variety of
pulmonary infections. Certainly more data are need, but this report is a
hopeful indication. - Mod.CHC
