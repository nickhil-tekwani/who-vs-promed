Plague Outbreak Kills 17 in Nebbi
---------------------------------
State minister for health Capt. Mike Mukula has said 17 people have died in
a fresh plague outbreak in Okoro county, Nebbi district, reports Gilbert
Awekofua. "Yes, on Saturday we dispatched an emergency team with an
assortment of drugs to Nebbi. From here, Dr Sam Okware is handling the team
nationally and I should be able to get there myself later," he said
yesterday. The MP for Okoro, Simon D'Ujanga, said yesterday all public
gatherings had been banned in the county. He said district independence
celebrations which were scheduled to take place in Kango, one of the
affected sub-counties, has been shifted to the district headquarters.
D'Ujanga said the official opening of Zeu Village Bank slated for 8 Oct
2001 had also been postponed indefinitely. Zeu is one of the affected
sub-counties. The District Director of Health Services, Dr Sam Orach, said
the district had embarked on a media campaign to ensure that the dead are
buried immediately and not transported from one place to another. "The
first death occurred in Umua village. The body was transported to Uwathu
village where people are now affected. The one from Atheju village in Zeu
came from Warr village, where somebody went to attend a burial," Orach said.
Orach said the disease has been in Nebbi for over 40 years now. He said
there were 45 cases reported last year with 15 deaths and another 42 cases
in 1998.

[The GIDEON database indicates that plague is endemic to Uganda's western
region, Nebbi District, and northern region, Arua District. A total of 18
cases were reported in 1954; 153 cases (3 fatal) were reported in 1982; 340
(27 fatal) in 1986; 167 (18 fatal) in 1993 (the latter from the western,
Nebbi District). From the Arua District, 49 (16 fatal) cases were reported
in 1998. In the intervening years, few cases were reported. Rodent
control is undoubtedly the key to altering the pattern. - Mod.ES
