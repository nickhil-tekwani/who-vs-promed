Encephalitis detected in Martin County
--------------------------------------
For the 1st time in 30 years mosquito control officials have found
traces of Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in Martin County. Two
chickens living on farmland along Cove Road tested positive for the disease.

"It could be what happens every year you get a little bit of an
undercurrent of mosquito disease and then it goes away or it may be
that this is just the beginning of mosquito disease. We don't know
yet," said Gene Lemire, Mosquito Control director for the county.

Lemire says the breed [species of mosquito] that carries the disease
lives inland, in swampy areas, and does not come out during the day.

He says typically the mosquito will bite a bird which is infected
with equine encephalitis then go on to bite either a horse or a human
to pass it along. [Horses cannot pass the disease to humans and
humans cannot pass it horses. The mosquito can pass the disease to
either its equine victim or its human victim. - Mod.TG]

If a human contracts the disease it results in flu-like symptoms --
like headache, fever, dizziness and fatigue -- but for a horse it can
be more serious, even deadly. [Occasionally infection in humans can
lead to severe central nervous system disease and death. - Mod.DK].

"Horses can be vaccinated and should be and they won't get the
disease," said Lemire.

Health officials encourage the rest of us to practice the 5 "D's"

* Dusk and Dawn -- Avoid being outdoors when mosquitoes are seeking
blood, for many species this is during the dusk and dawn hours.

* Dress -- Wear clothing that covers skin.

* DEET -- When the potential exists for exposure to mosquitoes,
repellents containing DEET are recommended. Products with
concentrations up to 30 percent DEET are generally recommended for
most situations. (It is not recommended to use DEET on children
younger than 2 months old. Instead, infants should be kept indoors or
mosquito netting used over carriers when mosquitoes are present).
Always read the manufacturer's directions carefully before you put on
a repellent.

* Drainage -- Check around your home to rid the area of standing
water, where mosquitoes can lay their eggs.

Horse owners are encouraged to vaccinate their animals to prevent
viral infection.

Lemire says his staff has stepped up surveillance and spraying in the
southern part of Martin County wear they detected the disease, but he
says because the inland mosquito population is still relatively low
he's going to hold off on the aerial attacks at least for now.

[Now is the time to vaccinate those horses. The disease is usually
fatal to horses. While it takes at least 2 weeks to develop a
protective titer, the EEE titer is a shorted-lived titer, requiring
revaccination in about 4-6 months. For those along the Eastern
seaboard and the Gulf coast, where the mosquito population is likely
to live longer, it is often recommended to revaccinate in 3, or 4 or
6 months. - Mod.TG]
