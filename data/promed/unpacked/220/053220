In October 2010, the body of a young short-beaked common dolphin was found stranded on a beach in San Diego, California. The sickly female had lesions in its airway, and a necropsy showed that she died of so-called tracheal bronchitis, likely due to an infection. Now, further investigation has revealed the dolphin's malaise was caused by a virus that scientists had never seen before, according to a new study. The pathogen, which researchers propose should be named dolphin polyomavirus 1, or DPyV-1, is still quite mysterious. Scientists say they don't know where it came from, how common it might be, or what threat it poses to wildlife. "We don't even know if this is even a dolphin virus. It could also represent a spillover event from another species," Simon Anthony, a researcher who studies wildlife pathogens at Columbia University, said in a statement. "It's no immediate cause for alarm, but it's an important data point in understanding this family of viruses and the diseases they cause."

Genetic analysis showed that the polyomavirus found in the San Diego dolphin was distinct from other known polyomaviruses (a widespread family of small DNA viruses that can sometimes cause infections and tumors in various animals). The pathogen appeared to be most closely related to the California sea lion polyomavirus, the researchers reported online on Wednesday [10 Jul 2013] in the journal PLoS ONE (see part [2] below for abstract). "It's possible that many dolphins carry this virus or other polyomaviruses without significant problems," said Judy St. Leger, the director of pathology at SeaWorld in San Diego, who performed the initial animal autopsy (or necropsy) on the stranded dolphin.

The researchers say they do not know of any other cases resembling the stranded dolphin in San Diego, but they are searching for more examples of polyomavirus in the species. The team hopes to determine the prevalence of DPyV-1 in short-beaked common dolphins and find out if it represents a significant source of dolphin illness and mortality.

Understanding how viruses develop in marine mammals is important for protecting endangered species, whose populations could nosedive if they are hit by a deadly outbreak. And marine mammals can pick up pathogens that originated in other animals, even humans. Canine distemper virus, for example, has caused sickness in seals and polar bears (often considered marine mammals since they spend much of their time at sea). A strain of bird flu was blamed for a mass die-off of New England harbor seals in 2011. Earlier this year, researchers found that a group of northern elephant seals off the coast of central California was carrying the [influenza] H1N1 virus strain, which caused a swine flu outbreak in humans in 2009. The seals could have caught the species-jumping pathogen from human feces dumped out of shipping vessels or seabirds, the scientists speculated at the time.

Identification of a Novel Cetacean Polyomavirus from a Common Dolphin (Delphinus delphis) with Tracheobronchitis

Abstract
--------
A female short-beaked common dolphin calf was found stranded in San Diego, California in October 2010, presenting with multifocal ulcerative lesions in the trachea and bronchi. Viral particles suggestive of polyomavirus were detected by electron microscopy, and subsequently confirmed by PCR [polymerase chain reaction] and sequencing. Full genome sequencing (Ion Torrent) revealed a circular dsDNA genome of 5159 bp that was shown to form a distinct lineage within the genus _Polyomavirus_ based on phylogenetic analysis of the early and late transcriptomes. Viral infection and distribution in laryngeal mucosa was characterised using in-situ hybridisation, and apoptosis observed in the virus-infected region. These results demonstrate that polyomaviruses can be associated with respiratory disease in cetaceans, and expand our knowledge of their diversity and clinical significance in marine mammals.

[Polyomaviruses are non-enveloped viruses, each with a single circular double-stranded DNA genome of approximately 5 kilobases. They are distributed widely in humans, birds and other animals. In their natural hosts they exist predominantly as persistent infections and are rarely associated with overt disease processes other than mild urinary and respiratory infections. Dolphin polyomavirus 1, however, was associated with tracheal bronchitis, which may indicate that the short-beaked common dolphin was not the primary host of the virus. Further phylogenetic analyses and virus isolations will be needed to clarify the situation. - Mod.CP]

[The short-beaked common dolphin (_Delphinus delphis_) occurs throughout warm-temperate portions of the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, Caribbean Sea and Mediterranean Sea.
