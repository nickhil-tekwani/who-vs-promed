[In response to some queries about percentages, Dr Noseda replied:]

The reported 85 964 cattle vaccinated (16.8 percent) were in the
county (partido) of Azul, which carries some 510 524 head. These were
registered vaccinations as part of the targeted Anthrax Control and
Surveillance programme in that county.

There is no national vaccination registry for anthrax and so the
national coverage can only be guessed at. It is believed to be
potentially approx. 25 percent of all cattle at risk. There are some
53 million cattle in the country and the annual production of anthrax
vaccine is 11 058 500 doses.

[The major national production of high quality beef is from the
pampas of Buenos Aires Province. And this province also has the best
soils for anthrax spore survival. Therefore it is extremely important
to have a proactive and effective anthrax control and surveillance
programme in this county where historically most anthrax has been
seen. It is succeeding and each year there are fewer outbreaks. When
they occur it usually involves cattle which had not been vaccinated
in spite of the advice given to the owner. Unfortunately as the
incidence falls, owners think their stocks are no longer at risk. We
see the same problem each year on the Canadian prairies and in the
Dakotas and north west Minnesota. - Mod.MHJ]
