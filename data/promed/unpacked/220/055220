[While Talas appears to have had its share of outbreaks, they are seldom reported. The only report we have is in a 2008 review of outbreaks in Kyrgyzstan, when 23 "foci," or outbreaks, were reported in the province. These cases usually follow from slaughtering and butchering sick animals, mainly cattle, so that the meat can be shared with neighbours and sold in local markets.

Talas is in north-western Kyrgyzstan along the Kazakh border, west of Chuy, and north of Jalal-Abad. For a map of Kyrgyzstan showing Talas, go to: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/kyrgyzstan_pol_05.jpg. - Mod.MHJ
