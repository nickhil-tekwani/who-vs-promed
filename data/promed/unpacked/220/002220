Abstract
--------
Background. Usutu virus (USUV) is a member of the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) serocomplex in the Flaviviridae family. Emergence of USUV in Europe has led to disease burdens in birds and created increasing concern for the potential zoonotic transmission to humans. Whilst USUV has not been detected in the New World, the identification of competent vector species in North America is critical in the assessment of the likelihood of its dispersal and establishment of enzootic transmission cycles. The objective of this study was to determine vector competence of potential mosquito vectors in North America for USUV. 3 medically important mosquito species were selected for testing because of their involvement in the transmission of West Nile virus and St Louis encephalitis virus, 2 related JEV serocomplex flaviviruses in the New World.

Methodology/principal findings. Oral challenge of _Culex pipiens_, _Culex quinquefasciatus_, and _Aedes albopictus_ was performed to determine the susceptibility and vector competence of North American mosquitoes for USUV. Infection status was monitored by the isolation of virus from homogenized mosquito tissues. The disseminated form of infection was demonstrated by the detection of infectious virus in the head, wings, and legs of infected mosquitoes. The presence of viral RNA in saliva of infected _Cx. pipiens_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ indicated that both species are competent for transmission of USUV.

Conclusions/significance. Results indicate that members of the _Cx. pipiens_ complex are susceptible to USUV and competent for its transmission potential in North America in the event of its introduction. In contrast, _Ae. albopictus_ were highly refractory to USUV infection, suggesting that this species is unlikely to contribute to USUV transmission in North America.

Author summary
--------------
Usutu virus is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus maintained between avian and mosquito species. Although the pathogen has only been detected in Africa and Europe, a growing concern of its dispersal and zoonotic potential warrants the investigation on the vector competence of mosquito species outside the endemic regions for USUV. Identification of species involved in the transmission cycles allows for the formulation of disease control strategies such as vector control. As observed with West Nile virus and Japanese encephalitis virus, the presence of competent vector species is critical for the establishment of enzootic transmission cycles and contributes to the viral maintenance in nature. Despite differences in the genetics and bionomics of _Culex pipiens_ in the Old World, members of the _Cx. pipiens_ species in the New World are competent for USUV based on the results of per os challenges performed in this study. _Cx. pipiens_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_ are capable of initiating enzootic transmission cycles in the presence of susceptible avian species and should be targeted for vector control in the event of a disease outbreak.

[This is a good news/bad news report. The good news is that _Aedes albopictus_, a mosquito expanding its range in the USA, was shown to be refractory to USUV. The bad news is that 2 common and widely distributed mosquito species, _Cx. pipiens_ and _Cx. quinquefasciatus_, are susceptible to infection by that virus and capable of initiating enzootic transmission cycles in the presence of susceptible avian species.

Over the past 16 years, USUV become fairly widely distributed in Europe with rare cases in humans and sporadic cases in birds. Although it may seem very unlikely that USUV would arrive in North America from Africa or Europe and become established, one only need remember West Nile virus and its arrival in New York in 1999 and its subsequent dissemination in the continental USA and much of the Americas to know that this type of arrival and dissemination can happen when competent vector mosquitoes are present and abundant, and just await the arrival of the virus. - Mod.TY]
