USDA amends Minnesota's Bovine TB status
----------------------------------------
The U. S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service (USDA_APHIS) is amending its bovine tuberculosis
(TB) regulations regarding state and zone classifications by removing
Minnesota from the list of modified accredited advanced states and
adding it to the list of modified accredited states.

As a result of Minnesota's reclassification as a modified accredited
state, the interstate movement of cattle and bison moving from
Minnesota will be restricted, according to federal regulations, in
order to prevent the spread of tuberculosis.

Increased TB testing and certification requirements will affect all
cattle and bison moving interstate except those animals moving to
slaughter or originating from accredited herds.

Prior to this interim rule, Minnesota was designated as modified
accredited advanced.

Federal regulations for accredited status are based on the prevalence
of TB in a state or zone, and 4 TB-infected herds have recently been
detected in Minnesota.

To qualify as modified accredited advanced, a state or zone with
fewer than 30 000 cattle herds -- such as Minnesota -- may have up to
3 affected herds for each of the most recent 2 years.

APHIS classifies states or zones within states according to its level
of occurrence of bovine TB. There are 5 classification designations:
accredited free; modified accredited advanced; modified accredited,
accredited preparatory and non-accredited. Restrictions on the
interstate movement of cattle become less stringent as a state
approaches or achieves accredited free status.

Bovine TB is a contagious and infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium bovis.

It affects cattle, bison, deer, elk, goats and other warm-blooded
species and can be fatal. The disease can be transmitted to humans
through direct contact with infected animals or consumption of raw
milk. It is not transmitted through consumption of pasteurized milk.

The interim rule will be effective upon publication in the 9 Apr 2008
Federal Register.

[Tuberculosis is a slow, insidious disease requiring extended time
and testing to ferret out the disease. In addition to testing cattle
and bison for movement requirements, it is likely Minnesota will also
be requesting voluntary assistance from deer hunters, asking them to
report suspicious lesions on the harvested animals. - Mod.TG]
