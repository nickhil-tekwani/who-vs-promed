Nursery children are among several people who have been infected with a "very rare" _E. coli_ strain that led to kidney problems in some patients. 10 people in the Blandford area of Dorset have been diagnosed with the bacterial illness since July 2014, Public Health England (PHE) said. Those affected include children at Blandford Children's Centre Nursery.

PHE said the "cluster of illnesses" involved the O55 strain, not identified in England since records began in 1994; 7 of those affected developed kidney problems, but there have been no deaths, PHE confirmed. The most frequently reported _E. coli_ strain to cause illness in England and Wales is O157, which can be fatal.

Vanessa Glenn, head of family support at Dorset County Council, which runs the nursery in Black Lane, said a child there was diagnosed with _E. coli_ infection in mid-October 2014. She said it was closed for 3 days while deep-cleaning work was carried out. Another child from the nursery became ill on Mon 24 Nov 2014, and it is currently closed pending the results of staff blood tests and child stool samples, she added.

She said there had also been another _E. coli_ case involving a child from Blandford who had attended Shaftesbury Children's Centre, although this is not part of the "cluster." Ms Glenn said: "While there is no indication of a direct link between the nursery and recent cases, we are working closely with Public Health England and local authority environmental health officers to help tackle the problem." She added that parents had been "kept fully informed" and were being advised of the nursery closure.

Noeleen McFarland, consultant in health protection at PHE Wessex, said any _E. coli_ infection was "very serious," and added that it "can be passed easily from person to person, and young children are particularly easily affected." The kidney problems some of those affected have experienced -- called hemolytic uremic syndrome -- are a "serious complication" of an _E. coli_ infection, PHE said. It added that all those affected and their close contacts were being followed up, and further investigations were taking place to determine the likely source.

"As some cases have occurred in people associated with a children's nursery, letters have been sent to parents whose children attend the nursery and staff, informing them about _E. coli_ O55 and the ongoing investigation," PHE said.

North Dorset Environmental Health Department is assisting with the investigation.

[As a reminder, other non-O157 _E. coli_ serogroups that have been associated with EHEC disease include motile ones such as O26:H11 and O104:H21 and non-motile ones such as O111:NM (or H-). Such non-O157 isolates can be obtained from sheep and cattle, and although they cause as many as 30 per cent of outbreaks of EHEC (1), they appear to be somewhat less (or at least more variably) virulent in a variety of in vivo and in vitro assays (2-4). In analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups, it has been found that they belong to their own lineages and have unique profiles of virulence traits different from O157 (5). The serogroups appearing to be most prominent are O26, O111, O128, and O103 (6).

If a laboratory is using sorbitol-MacConkey (sMAC) plates to identify EHEC by virtue of O157's inability to ferment sorbitol, the non-O157 strains will be missed. In a 3-year pediatric study from the University of Washington, USA (7), 1851 stool samples were processed for sorbitol fermentation as well as toxin production by EIA (enzyme immunoassay), and 28 strains of O157 were found along with O103 (4 strains), O118 (2 strains), O111 (2 strains), and 3 other strains.
