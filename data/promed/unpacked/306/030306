from Hebrew, abridged, edited]

The Veterinary Services and Animal Health were notified on Mon 22 Jan
2007 about suspected FMD cases in a cattle feedlot in Kibbutz Beit
Hashita, northern Israel. Samples were collected and sent to the
Kimron Veterinary Institute at Beit-Dagan on the same day. The sample
was found positive for FMDV serotype O on Wed 24 Jan 2007. The
infected location and a 10-km radius area around it have been
declared infected and put under the required restrictions.
The affected animals are fattening calves, 9-11 months old; initial
clinical symptoms, mainly lameness, were initially observed on 18 Jan 2007.

[This is the 3rd FMD outbreak reported from Israel since the
beginning of 2007; the 1st one involved goats in Netua, on the
Lebanese border, notified to the OIE on 2 Jan 2007; see map in the
notification at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=4351>.
The 2nd outbreak involved beef cattle in Mevo-Hamma, adjacent to the
Syrian-Jordanian frontiers. It was reported to the OIE on 4 Jan 2007.
See map in the notification at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=4391>.
The current outbreak is situated in the midst of a densely populated
agricultural area, in the valley of Yizreel, adjacent to large dairy
farms and other livestock. For the location of Beit Hashita, go to
square 5 in the interactive map at
<http://www.eyeonisrael.com/map_Israel.html>.
The vaccination status of the affected fattening calves is not
described in the circular; information will be helpful. Fortunately,
the entire bovine population and most small ruminants in Israel are
annually vaccinated against FMDV O. The Israeli veterinary services
should, however, be particularly concerned about the potential
introduction of FMDV A, recently identified in an outbreak in
neighboring Jordan. According to Jordan's notification to the OIE
dated 16 Jan 2007, this virus, absent from both countries for more
than 2 decades, was identified by the world reference laboratory at
Pirbright on 19 Dec 2006. These results are not yet available on the
[OIE World Animal Health Information System] website.
It is not known whether the trivalent (O, A, Asia 1) vaccine applied
to vaccinate cattle in Israel will confer (satisfactory) protection
against the exotic A strain. Small ruminants are annually vaccinated
in Israel with a monovalent, FMDV serotype O strain only. - Mod.AS]
