Rabid mountain lion attacks boy
-------------------------------
A rabid mountain lion attacked a 10 year old boy north of Phoenix on
Saturday [8 Mar 2008], before being shot and killed by a family member,
said Randy Babb of the Arizona Department Game and Fish. "The family was
riding all-terrain vehicles, took a break and while relaxing, an adult
female mountain lion attacked the boy," Babb said. The boy was lucky to
have suffered only minor scratches to his back, Babb said.

The incident occurred in the Tonto National Forest in an area called Sheep
Bridge in the extreme south east corner of Yavapai County. The region is on
the back side of the Mazatzal Mountains, a rugged mix of desert chaparral
and pinyon-juniper vegetation, according to Tom Cadden, public information
officer for the Arizona Game and Fish Department.

"One of the adults shot the animal and transported it back to their
residence," Babb said. The mountain lion was then submitted to the Arizona
State Health Laboratory for testing. The boy and several others who may
have been exposed to the cat will undergo preventative rabies treatment
over the next few weeks, Babb said.

"Very seldom ever [do you ] see large mammals with rabies," according to
Babb. "They're more common in bats, skunks and gray foxes. We're not
expecting to see any more animals this large with rabies." Babb stressed
the attack was mostly likely an isolated incident.

So far this year, 14 animals have tested positive for rabies at the ADHS
State Health Laboratory, including 2 others in the last week -- a
coatimundi from the Oracle area and a rabid fox from the Clifton area.
There were no human exposures in those cases, but 3 dogs were exposed to
the rabid fox.

At least 27 pets have been exposed to rabid animals this year, according to
Game and Fish officials. "It is imperative for pet owners to immunize their
animals against rabies and to ensure that these vaccinations are kept up to
date," said state public health veterinarian Dr Elisabeth Lawaczeck.

[This article does not state that the test for rabies on the mountain lion
was positive. Given the apparent prevalence of the disease in the area now,
it is certainly a safe bet to start the people on post exposure prophalaxis.

The behavior of the animal is certainly suspicious of rabies. With the
child being scratched, it not worth taking a chance with this disease. -
