Raw milk caused an undetermined number of illnesses before being removed from store shelves last weekend in southeast Pennsylvania. Those sickened suffered from severe gastrointestinal symptoms after drinking raw milk. The cows thought to be responsible for those illnesses are being tested for _Salmonella_ by the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture. Samantha Elliott Krepps, the department's press secretary, told Food Safety News that the test results are not yet available.

Dutch Meadows Dairy at Paradise, Pennsylvania, and Camphill Village Kimberton Hills Dairy at Kimberton, Pennsylvania, both had their raw milk pulled from store shelves. Retail sales of raw milk are legal in Pennsylvania, with regulatory responsibilities split between local or regional health departments and the state Department of Agriculture. The 2 dairies were persuaded to pull their raw milk dairy products by the Chester County Health Department after several people became ill after drinking it. The department has not provided any further information.

According to Kimberton Whole Foods, a 4-store local chain, Dutch Meadows was planning to resume sales this week, while Camphill Kimberton will not be found back on store shelves until 5 Jan 2013.

In a notice posted on its website, the retailer said Camphill Kimberton is having its milk tested for _Salmonella_.

Dutch Meadows produces certified organic raw milk from Dutch-belted cows, a heritage breed. Camphill Village Kimberton is a 210-acre dairy farm with about 90 Brown Swiss and Milking Short Horn cows. Its raw milk is used by the nearby Steven Stars Farm to produce yogurt.

The 2 dairy farms are about 160 miles apart on opposite sides of Harrisburg. The area allows dairy cows to feed on diverse pastures from April to November. The 4 Kimberton Whole Foods stores are located in the Pennsylvania towns of Kimberton, Douglassville, Downingtown and Ottsville.

[Since the cows are being tested for _Salmonella_, it is probable that the cases, number unstated, are of salmonellosis. Classical zoonotic organisms such as _Brucella abortus_, _Brucella melitensis_, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ species, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ species, _Yersinia_ species, _Coxiella burnetii_, and _E. coli_ O157:H7 are associated with raw milk ingestion. Non-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_ Typhi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ species, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from _Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A have also been associated with raw milk ingestion. - Mod.LL
