I suspect that incorporating Isoniazid (without other antimycobacterial
agents) into animal feed will have the simple outcome of rapidly creating
INAH resistant _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ or _M. bovis_ in animals with
symptomatic infection, even if adequate dosage can be guaranteed.
This is mathematically predictable, given the organism load in symptomatic
cases and the known rate of random mutation to isoniazid resistance in _M.
tuberculosis_ complex. It is probable that an animal with a heavy infection
will already have a few resistant organisms on board.

The use of isoniazid alone as prophylaxis in humans with exposure but no
clinical illness can really only be justified on the grounds that the total
organism load is likely to be low, and the probability of a resistant
population of mycobacteria emerging, surviving and causing disease in a
patient with an intact immune system is also fairly low.

[This report is consistent with the theory that inadequate treatment regimens
in humans (usually due to patient stopping the medication) is a factor in the
emergence of multiple drug resistant (MDR) strains of _M. tuberculosis_.
