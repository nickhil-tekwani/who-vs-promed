2003/052 Isolated finding of citrus tristeza closterovirus in Algeria
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The EPPO Secretariat has recently been informed by the NPPO of Algeria that
an isolated focus of citrus tristeza closterovirus [CTV] (EPPO A2
quarantine pests) was found on 2 experimental plots of citrus propagation
material.
The plots were located at the experimental stations of Beni Tamou and
Chebli (Wilaya of Blida). Until this finding, CTV had never been found at
these locations. Phytosanitary measures were immediately taken: movement of
citrus material from infected areas was prohibited and further tests
(DAS-ELISA, immunoprinting, indexing) were done to delimit the extent of
the infection.
Samples were taken from 4869 trees and 4000 nursery plants grown at Beni
Tamou and Chebli. CTV was not detected in the 4000 nursery plants tested.
On trees used for the production of basic material, 4 of 996 trees (0.4 per
cent), 18 of 580 pre-basic trees (3.1 per cent) and 70 of 3289 trees (2.1
per cent) tested at Chebli were positive for CTV. All 92 infected trees
were destroyed. Surveys are continuing to verify the absence of the virus.
The situation of CTV in Algeria can be described as follows: Present, found
only in 2 citrus multiplication plots at the experimental stations of Beni
Tamou and Chebli (Wilaya of Blida), under eradication.

[CTV is the most damaging virus disease of citrus worldwide. Citrus
tristeza disease, also known as `quick decline' in the USA, is the most
destructive disease of citrus in the western hemisphere and occurs
worldwide in production areas. Less than 2 decades after tristeza was
introduced from Africa into South America in the 1920s, the disease had
basically eliminated much of the citrus industries in Argentina, Brazil,
and Uruguay. In 2002, the leading producer country was Brazil (18 694 000
tonne [metric ton; 1000 kg]) followed by USA, Mexico, Spain, Egypt, Greece,
Pakistan, South Africa, and Turkey. Algeria's production was 330 000 tonnes
in 2002. Disease management depends upon use of tristeza-resistant or
tolerant rootstocks, screening budwood stocks for presence of the virus,
and the use of mild CTV strains for cross-protection. - Mod.DH]
