Dutch potato farmers face going out of business if the worst fears about this year's [2016] poor crop are realised. In parts of Limburg, North Brabant and Gelderland, the year's crop was written off as early as July 2016, as fields flooded.

The sector has also been hit by the discovery of the rare disease potato tuber spindle viroid in the north east polder region.

[_Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (PSTVd; type member of genus _Pospiviroid_) is an important pathogen of solanaceous crops including potato, tomato, and capsicum. It causes spindle tuber (or "gothic") disease in potato and bunchy top in tomato. Yield losses can be up to 65 per cent in potato and up to 50 per cent in tomato. Many solanaceous ornamental and weed species are also susceptible to PSTVd and may serve as pathogen reservoirs. PSTVd has been included on the EPPO A2 quarantine list.

Symptoms in potato may include spindly shoots, stunting of plants, severely distorted tubers (spindles) and delayed sprouting. In tomatoes, symptoms include leaf chlorosis and distortion, shortening of internodes, stunting of plants and absence of flowers. Capsicum plants show stunting and a loss of plant vigour but often display only mild symptoms of leaf distortion. Infection of solanaceous ornamentals is often symptomless. All varieties of tomato and potato appear to be susceptible, but mild strains causing latent infections in some host cultivars exist.

PSTVd is seed transmitted at a rate of up to 100 per cent, depending on the host cultivar. It is assumed to have spread among potato germplasm collections all over the world via infected true seed. Tomato seed has been shown to constitute a considerable quarantine risk (ProMED-mail post 20140122.2222560). Spread occurs also via infected plants or vegetative plant parts (potato seed tubers; tomato and capsicum explants), pollen, mechanical means (including insects and during handling procedures) and plant-to-plant contact. Only in the presence of _Potato leafroll virus_ can PSTVd also be transmitted by an aphid vector (_Myzus persicae_).

Due to the multiple potential transmission routes and the large number of host species, both epidemiology and control of PSTVd are complicated. The presence of PSTVd (and other pospiviroids) in a number of symptomless reservoir hosts has been reported from several countries and must be considered a threat to crops. Furthermore, PSTVd is exceptionally stable and can survive in dried sap or plant residue for considerable times. Disease management relies mainly on removal of infected plants and other possible sources of inoculum, phytosanitary procedures, as well as use of certified PSTVd-free seed and other planting material. Pospiviroids are considered an emerging phytosanitary threat worldwide because of their potential effects on a number of very important crops and the high risk of incursions via commercial imports.

In the Netherlands, an eradication programme of PSTVd in potato breeding material has been in progress and no infections were found in commercial seed potatoes in 2014 and 2015. A current PSTVd outbreak on seedless capsicum in southern areas (ProMED-mail post 20160422.4175522) was traced back to propagation material imported from Israel. It remains to be clarified if this new outbreak is connected with either of these potential sources, or if it may be a new incursion.
