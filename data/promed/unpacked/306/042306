With respect to the ongoing outbreak of mumps in Israel, it seems
that the disease has become more widely spread, apparently affecting
additional sectors of the population [see prior ProMED-mail posting
'Mumps - Israel (04): Yeshiva students 20100723.2472']. As of 10 Jul
2010 (the most recent available weekly epidemiological report), the
total number of reported confirmed cases this year is 4185 (compared
with 6 confirmed cases during the same period last year - 2009).
There is spread of disease in kindergartens and elementary schools in
central/coastal Israel, in addition to Jerusalem. This includes
children who have been MMR vaccinated, as well as some of those duly
boosted (with the Jeryl Lynn mumps vaccine) at the age of 6-8.

Genotyping of the prevailing G5 virus strain, reportedly revealed a
single nucleotide difference, initially in Jerusalem and later on in
Bnei-Brak. The possibility that this nucleotide difference has had
any impact on vaccine efficacy in the country has been a matter for
(inconclusive) discussion.

[The following information is the last paragraph in a newswire on the
West Nile virus outbreak in Israel. - Mod.MPP]

The Ministry has also noted a rise in the incidence of mumps in
recent months, with 4190 cases since the beginning of the year
[January 2010]. A ministry advisory committee has recommended a
program of mumps vaccinations, particularly in areas where the
outbreaks have occurred, notably in ultra-Orthodox communities.

[The following response to the 2 items above has been kindly provided
by the Israeli Ministry of Health and is gratefully acknowledged:

"In January 2010 the Ministry of Health noted a rise in the incidence
of mumps. A ministry advisory committee has recommended a program of
mumps vaccinations, particularly in areas where the outbreaks have
occurred, notably in ultra-Orthodox communities. In recent months
incidence has decreased, but the outbreak is still ongoing after it
peaked on April 2009, with a total of 4190 cases since the beginning
of the year. It should be noted that the spread of the disease to the
general population is limited: case incidence is highest in the
ultra-orthodox community". - Mods.AS/CP
