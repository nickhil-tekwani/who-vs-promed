[The above official OIE notification of 3 Aug 2007 relates to a
single, seroconverted, symptomless heifer, (serologically) confirmed
on 25 Jul 2007, the serotyping of which pending.
According to the website of the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature
& Food Quality, as of 1 Aug 2007 the number of bluetongue outbreaks
in the Netherlands was 23, including one in Hoenderloo (about 15 km
or 9.32 miles north of Arnhem), which meant the boundary of the "20
km or 12.42 mile area" had to be extended northwards, now covering
more than 50 percent of the country's territory. See:
<http://www.minlnv.nl/portal/page?_pageid=116,1640542&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL&p_news_item_id=22597>.
According to the 3 Aug 2007 update of TABLE 11: ANIMAL DISEASE
SITUATION PER COUNTRY AND PER DISEASE in EU's ANIMAL DISEASE
NOTIFICATION SYSTEM (ADNS), 30 new outbreaks of bluetongue have been
recorded in the Netherlands between 26 Jul and 1 Aug 2007. See at:
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/adns/table_11_2007/adns_030807_en.pdf>.

Epidemiological information on the disease (including species and
breed clinical susceptibility), as well as a formal laboratory
confirmation of the serotype involved, are anticipated.
It will also be valuable to obtain (suggested) explanation(s) for the
overwintering mechanism of the virus. - Mod.AS].
