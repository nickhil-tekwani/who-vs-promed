Report of 1st Meeting of SARS Scientific Research Advisory
Committee (SRAC)
--------------------------------------------------
The WHO SARS Scientific Research Advisory Committee
concluded its first 2-day meeting in Geneva on Tue 21 Oct 2003.
The meeting, which brought together more than 30 leading SARS
researchers, aimed to identify the specific research most urgently
needed to understand the disease better and prepare for its
possible recurrence. Participants agreed on the priority research
questions to be addressed in the coming months.
Questions fall into the main areas of epidemiology, laboratory
diagnostics, outbreak management, case management, including
treatment outcomes and infection control, and social impact. The
research agenda, which will undergo further review by participants,
is expected to be finalized for public release within a week.
Preparation of the research agenda was based on a discussion of
several problems that emerged during the outbreak and an analysis
of subsequent data, including areas where additional scientific
evidence was needed to identify the most cost-effective control
strategies. Participants expressed a great need to ensure that the
world can recognize and respond to a recurrence of SARS in ways
that work faster to achieve control and are less costly and socially
disruptive. The following topics were discussed.
The Global SARS Alert System
----------------------------
Concerning the level of operational preparedness to detect new
cases, participants noted that the system of alert now in place will
probably work well to pick up clusters of severe disease. False-
alarms are fully expected and have already occurred. They
provide reassurance that the alert system is working well. However,
participants agreed that sporadic cases of SARS may not be
detected early.
Mild SARS cases and cases with atypical symptoms could be
initially missed, hence the importance for several lines of defence
in which the intensity of surveillance is determined by the level of
risk (zone of re-emergence, nodal areas, and low-risk areas).
Moreover, the system for global alert is weakened by the fact that
at least half of the world's population has no access to services
that can perform simple chest X-rays.
Some countries are continuing a policy of heightened alert for
persons with a recent travel history to one of the initial outbreak
sites. Failure to elicit such a history should not automatically
exclude SARS as a diagnosis if other clinical, laboratory, and
epidemiological features are consistent with the diagnosis. The
Hotel Metropole incident, in which contact with a single infected
person seeded the outbreak's international spread, was a random
event illustrating the limitations that travel history can have in the
post-outbreak situation. Any major transportation hub near an
international airport could be the scene for a similar seeding of
international spread.
Preparedness in Resource-poor Settings
--------------------------------------
Following the global alerts of 12 and 15 Mar 2003, most countries
experiencing imported cases were able to prevent any further
transmission or hold the number of cases to very small numbers,
indicating the effectiveness of a high level of alert. It is hoped
that, should SARS re-emerge, the disease would occur in small
pockets of cases that could, with the present level of vigilance, be
rapidly detected and contained.
A major concern is the occurrence of cases in resource-poor
settings, where health infrastructures might not be able to cope
with the demands of case detection, isolation, intensive care, and
contact tracing. Outbreak dynamics in such settings could take on
dimensions different than those seen during the initial outbreak. In
the absence of sophisticated hospital facilities and treatment
procedures, which are known to amplify transmission, developing
countries might not experience explosive increases in cases for
the same reasons as seen elsewhere. Many other factors, such as
crowding on wards and lack of adequate isolation facilities, could
contribute to so-called "super-spreading" events.
Some discussion centered on ways to identify areas that might be
at particular risk. One approach would be to assess air passenger
flows to determine which cities are most vulnerable to international
spread. Support for enhanced surveillance and preparedness
plans could then be targeted to areas considered at greatest risk.
Diagnosis
--------
Diagnosis of SARS is difficult, and all currently available
laboratory tests have limitations. At present, there is no single
"gold standard" that can be recommended for laboratory testing.
Different tests are appropriate for different stages of the disease.
Another problem affecting the reliability of available serological
tests is cross-reaction with other human coronaviruses, which are
widespread.
The laboratory confirmation of 2 or more cases in the same health
care unit during a 10-day period would have great significance in
the post-outbreak setting, perhaps signalling the start of another
global emergency. For this reason, and in view of the inadequacy of
diagnostic tests, the experts recommended a policy of rigorous
verification, whereby positive tests in one laboratory would need to
be confirmed by an external, internationally recognized reference
laboratory. A system of quality assurance of tests was also judged
essential, as were internationally-agreed algorithms that could help
clinicians make difficult diagnostic choices. These issues are being
discussed further at the SARS Laboratory Network Meeting on
Wed 22 Oct 2003.
Diagnosis would also benefit from some method of identifying,
perhaps through immunological or genetic markers, which patients
might develop severe illness and which patients might contribute to
super-spreading events. An additional concern is the development
of diagnostic tests suitable for use in resource-poor settings.
Possible Evolution of the SARS Coronavirus
----------------------------------------
Studies of coronaviruses in a number of animal species indicate
that some of these viruses readily cross from one species to
others, lending weight to theories that the SARS virus originally
jumped from some natural animal host to humans. Recent
experimental studies have easily infected 2 animal species with the
SARS virus, suggesting that the range of animal hosts where the
SARS virus could "hide" between outbreaks is much wider than
initially suspected.
In animal diseases caused by coronaviruses, the severity of
disease can be exacerbated by such factors as co-infection with
other respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses, some forms of
treatment, and stress, especially during transport. Virus shedding is
longer, and respiratory symptoms are more severe following
exposure to aerosolized virus. These features may shed some
light on super-spreading events, which remain poorly understood.
In Hong Kong, for example, transmission was amplified in hospitals
where certain aerosol-producing procedures, including the use of
nebulizers, were performed during the earliest days of the outbreak.
Animal studies indicate that coronaviruses can be spread
mechanically. This mode of spread may have contributed to
events, such as the Amoy Gardens outbreak, in which some
environmental contact with the virus clearly played a role.
Some coronaviruses are believed to survive in their animal hosts
despite seasonal changes in temperature. Others have mutated
into strains causing much milder disease. While these features
could hold true for the SARS virus, much more research is needed
before any conclusions about the future evolution of the SARS
virus can be reached.
Amplification in Hospitals: the Role of Infection Control
------------------------------------------------
The amplification of transmission within well-equipped hospitals
was a striking feature of SARS. In some cases, staff became
infected despite wearing full protective equipment. Participants
presented further compelling evidence that certain sophisticated
procedures, especially those that generate aerosols, greatly
amplify the risks of infection; less sophisticated hospitals fared
better.
Some cases of hospital-based infection could be attributed to clear
lapses in infection control. In this and several other cases,
research in the social sciences could assist in improving behaviour
while also helping staff cope with the considerable stress of dealing
with a new disease, a new type of patient, and new requirements
for care.
A disproportionately large amount of resources is needed to
prevent transmission of airborne infections. The required infection
control procedures are also extremely demanding for staff. As
SARS is not thought to be an airborne infection, research should
clarify the need for these measures compared with measures
needed to prevent transmission via droplets and contact with body
fluids. It was also agreed that the need for protective equipment is
related to procedures, and that, in advance of another emergency,
consideration needs to be given to equipment that provides a good
standard of care and adequate protection while also being
affordable and sustainable.
Laboratory Biosafety
--------------------
Better measures are needed internationally to prevent the
recurrence of SARS following a laboratory biosafety accident.
Health authorities should be encouraged to produce inventories of
all facilities conducting research on the virus or holding samples.
This information should then be communicated internationally to
WHO.
Control Interventions
---------------------
Rapid case detection and isolation, along with contact tracing and
follow-up, were generally regarded as an effective way to deal with
the emergence of a new disease. It reduces the pool of infectious
individuals circulating in the community and, in the case of contacts,
heightens the level of clinical suspicion, especially in the absence
of reliable diagnostic tests. However, good support from information
technologies is needed to manage the data required for more
efficient contact tracing. Research on the most effective
approaches to contact tracing is also needed.
Another important need is for the real-time compilation of data from
epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory sources, and their
integration into a single data-set available to the international
community. Access to such a database would contribute greatly to
assessment of the effectiveness of all interventions, including
treatment, in real time as a SARS outbreak -- or outbreak of any
other emerging disease -- unfolds.
