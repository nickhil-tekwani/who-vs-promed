As of Mon 13 Nov 2017, there have been a total of:
1740 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
703 deaths [reported case fatality rate 40.4 percent],
1016 recoveries, and
21 currently active cases/infections.

[As previously mentioned, the numbers of deaths, recoveries, and currently active cases come from my spreadsheet tallies and differ from those listed on the Saudi MOH website; my spreadsheet counts asymptomatic infections as they are reported. One complication is the reporting of cases as either recoveries or deaths that cannot be confirmed as previously reported newly confirmed cases. Another complication is delayed reporting of cases - Mod.MPP]

Since the last ProMED-mail update, 10 Nov 2017, there have been a total of:
2 newly confirmed cases,
0 newly reported fatalities, and
0 newly reported recoveries.
