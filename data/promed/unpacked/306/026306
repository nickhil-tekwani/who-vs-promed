A Taiwanese student who had been studying in Singapore since last year and
who recently returned to his Taipei County home was confirmed yesterday [24
Nov 2006] to have contracted chikungunya fever while in Singapore, a Center
for Disease Control (CDC) official said. The 13 year old student was
detected with high fever at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport 20 Nov
[2006] upon his return from Singapore. At that time, he said he was
suffering from fever and fatigue, according to Chou Chih-hao, deputy
director general of the CDC under the Cabinet-level Department of Health.
After examining a blood sample from the boy, the CDC announced that the boy
had contracted chikungunya fever -- a viral disease transmitted through
mosquito bites -- making him the 1st confirmed chikungunya fever case in
Taiwan medical history, Chou said.
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection can cause a debilitating illness, most
often characterized by fever, headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, muscle
pain, rash, and particularly joint pain, according to Chou. Chou said 3
suspected chikungunya fever cases had been reported in Taiwan in the past,
but all of them later tested negative.
Chou noted that the student's fever has passed and that he is now recovering
at home. Five of his family members have also been examined and monitored,
but none of them has had any symptoms of chikungunya fever, he added.

The country has reported its first ever case of chikungunya fever, a Center
for Disease Control (CDC) official said yesterday.
A 13 year old Taiwanese student was detected with a high fever at Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport on 20 Nov 2006 upon his return from Singapore
where he studies. At the time, he said he was suffering from fever and
fatigue and after examining a blood sample from the boy, the CDC announced
that he had contracted chikungunya fever.
"This disease is very similar to dengue fever, but less likely to be fatal"
said Chou Jih-haw, the CDC deputy director-general. Chikungunya fever
patients suffer substantial joint pain in addition to dengue fever-like
symptoms such as fever, headaches and muscular aches, Chou said.
"When the patient entered Taiwan, heat-registering cameras at the airport
indicated that he had a fever" said Chou, "We were able to conduct a blood
test on the spot." If the virus is still in its incubating phase, it is
impossible to detect carriers at the airport, said Chou. Like dengue-fever
sufferers who are stopped at the airport, the chikungunya sufferer was
allowed to enter Taiwan with no restrictions on movement.
However, the sufferer and his family will be medically monitored and the
environs of his home sprayed for mosquitoes to prevent the potential spread
of the disease. "So far, none of his family have come down with the
disease," said Chou, "We think the risk of the disease spreading and taking
root in Taiwan is small." However, Chou has asked that doctors be on the
lookout for apparent dengue cases that could be chikungunya fever.
Tseng Shu-hui, deputy director of the CDC's 5th division, said 94 dengue
fever suffers are known to have entered Taiwan this year.
Of the 94, 2/3 were stopped at the airport after being identified by
heat-registering camera technology and the rest were tracked down following
alerts from medical professionals.

[Residents of Taipei are potentially at risk of chikungunya virus becoming
transmitted from viremic travelers, as the _Aedes_ mosquito vectors are
present there. Fortunately, in this instance, no transmission was detected.
It is interesting that no reports of chikungunya in Singapore have been
received by ProMED-mal. Chikungunya virus infections have been a recurrent
problem in Indonesia, however, and have occurred in northern Malaysia. -

After the SARS outbreak hit Taiwan slightly over 3 years ago, the CDC of
Taiwan has installed heat-registering cameras at the 2 international
airports in order to detect firsthand any feverish passengers possibly
carrying infectious diseases from abroad. It has proven to work reasonably
well. Vivid examples are this summer's dengue cases of foreign origin and
the single case of chikungunya from Singapore.
