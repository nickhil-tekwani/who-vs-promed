- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 685, of which 636 are confirmed and 49 are probable. In total, there were 416 deaths (367 confirmed and 49 probable) and 244 people cured.
- 142 suspected cases under investigation.
- 5 new confirmed cases, including 4 in Katwa and 1 in Beni. The case of Beni is the 19-day-old baby of the confirmed case reported in the bulletin of 18 Jan 2019.
- 2 new deaths of confirmed cases (all community deaths) in Katwa.
- 1 new person healed out of Butembo CTE.

News of the response
------------------
Epidemiological situation in Katwa
- The health zones of Katwa and Butembo are the main current outbreaks of the epidemic, which reported 65% of new confirmed cases recorded in the last 21 days (58/89).
- The main difficulty in Katwa is the reluctance of relatives of confirmed cases. The majority of new confirmed cases identified in Katwa are reluctant contacts who have refused vaccination and follow-up of contacts. Thus, the last 10 confirmed cases of Katwa, in the Muchanga health area, have family or neighborhood links.

[Helen Branswell (https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell):
A 19-day-old baby is among the 5 new #Ebola cases the #DRC @MinSanteRDC is reporting today. The infant's mother is a confirmed case. There are also +2 deaths -- community deaths -- today, bringing the outbreak totals to 685 cases & 416 deaths.

Four of today's cases & both deaths occurred at Katwa, a health zone that's adjacent to Butembo, a large (+1 million) city. Butembo-Katwa is the current #Ebola hotspot & there's a huge amount of resistance there to containment measures like vaccination, contact monitoring, etc.]

[It appears to be cultural and social aspects that are perpetuating the outbreak in the DRC even when the new medical countermeasures that were not available to West Africa could stop the spread of the virus. The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine appears to be preventing an explosion of cases, but when those who need to be vaccinated, i.e. the contacts of infected individuals, cannot be identified, the virus will continue to spread. Efforts have been made to reach the traditional doctors and the locals, but the fear and distrust continue. Ebola treatment centers are being added; a 9th center just opened in Makayanga (see below), but there continue to be fatal cases following treatment at community clinics. The 19-day old baby might have been able to be saved had the mother presented at an Ebola treatment center before birth, although it may have been too late. Further, at the community clinics, others are exposed to the infectious patient. This is further exacerbated by the movement of the population due to ongoing unrest in the country. This outbreak is a major scientific and social challenge that calls for innovative approaches to engaging the communities and a lot of support. - Mod.LK]

News of the response
-----------------
Medical care
- On Thu 17 Jan 2019, the Governor of Ituri Province, Pacific Keta, inaugurated a new Ebola Treatment Center (ETC) and a laboratory in Makayanga (Komanda). This is the 9th CTE built during this 10th Ebola epidemic after those of Beni, Bunia, Butembo, Goma, Katwa, Mandima, Mangina and Tchomia. This new 28-bed CTE, the 3rd in the province of Ituri, is designed to treat and isolate confirmed and suspected cases of Ebola from the Komanda Health Zone and surrounding areas.

Vaccination

[2] Prevention and treatment

- Fri 18 Jan 2019. Ebola in North Kivu: checkpoints installed at the entrance to major cities
[Radio Okapi, online translation edited MJM]
https://www.radiookapi.net/2019/01/18/actualite/sante/ebola-au-nord-kivu-des-points-de-controle-installes-lentree-de-grandes

The coordinator of the Ebola response in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri, Dr. Aruna Abedi, announced on Fri 18 Jan 2019 measures taken to prevent the spread of this epidemic in new areas. These measures include the installation of epidemiological control points, deemed strategic, at the exit of certain areas already affected by Ebola to monitor the movements of people who carry this disease.

In other health zones, the epidemic has been mastered, said Dr. Aruna Abedi, expressing concern, however, about the "population movement that is causing cases that escape Katwa and Butembo who wanted to go to Goma." Among the decisions taken to deal with this situation is the strengthening of strategic points. It was able to detect cases that wanted to go to Goma.

"The logic is to strengthen the strategic points to protect the big cities, for example Goma, Kisangani, Bunia, Kasindi. And at these strategic points, we wanted the entry points to be operational and operate 24 hours a day," the source said.

In response to reluctance among the local population, the coordination of the Ebola response also involved law enforcement working with health staff to counter this reluctance.

https://www.radiookapi.net/2019/01/18/actualite/sante/ituri-le-gouverneur-inaugure-un-centre-de-traitement-debola-makayanga

The governor of Ituri, Pacific Keta inaugurated on Thu 17 Jan 2019, a large Ebola virus treatment center in Makayanga, located 85 km south of Bunia in the chiefdom of Basili.

This center is for the care of patients from the region of Komanda-Bwanasura where the case of Ebola is confirmed. These patients will no longer be transferred to Beni in North Kivu.

This center, built with funding from the Samaritan Purse International Organization in partnership with WHO, is the 3rd in Ituri after Bunia and Tshomia General Hospital on Lake Albert.

30 patients out of 49 registered cases have already died of Ebola virus in 4 health zones of Ituri since the official declaration of this epidemic in August 2018.

https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/north-kivu-drc-msf-scales-patient-care-activities-amid-growing

Almost 6 months after the declaration of the Ebola epidemic in northeastern DRC, response teams on the ground, including Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), are still struggling to gain control of the outbreak. So far, 619 [685, latest figures MoH] people have been infected with the virus, and 361 [416, latest figure MoH] of them have died in what is the 2nd-largest Ebola outbreak on record since the virus was discovered in this country in 1976.

As the number of new confirmed Ebola cases keeps growing, a heightened climate of unrest linked to the presidential elections has further restricted the population's access health care in and around the city of Beni, where several health centres were damaged during protests. This is making the prompt identification of new Ebola cases more challenging, as remaining health centres become overloaded.

"In this situation, people might have no other choice than to seek medical help in health facilities that do not have adequate triage or infection prevention and control measures in place, which makes the risk of contamination higher," says Laurence Sailly, MSF emergency coordinator in Beni. "We are talking about a population that has endured many years of conflict. On top of that, they are now faced with the deadliest Ebola outbreak the country has ever seen. The unrest of these past weeks adds even more to their plight by limiting their chances of finding adequate medical care."

Since the outbreak was declared on 1 Aug 2018, MSF has been steadily scaling up patient care activities to tackle the increasing number of confirmed Ebola cases, most recently in the Butembo, Katwa and Komanda health zones. This includes the expansion of the Ebola treatment centre (ETC) in Butembo from 64 to 96 beds, the opening of a new ETC in Katwa -- east of Butembo -- and the opening of a transit centre in Bwana Sura in Komanda, Ituri province, where new hotspots have been identified.

"With more and more cases coming from the city of Butembo, which has a population of almost a million people, it was necessary to set up a 2nd treatment centre very rapidly," says Emmanuel Massart, MSF project coordinator in Katwa. "We are also addressing the need to gain the trust of the affected communities. We designed the Katwa treatment centre with the aim of offering greater capacity for patient care. Large windows allow our patients to see the faces of the doctors and nurses treating them and make family visits easier, reestablishing some of the human contact that is so hard to maintain in Ebola treatment centers."

Raising awareness among communities about measures to control the spread of Ebola remains one of the main challenges of the outbreak response and has become largely the responsibility of those actors of the intervention. Reaching communities has become even more difficult as the tension that followed the postponement of the elections in Beni and Butembo increased the distance between the population and Ebola response activities. People are now even more reluctant to accept infection prevention and control practices such as safe and dignified burials or the decontamination of health centres and households.

"With Ebola, treatment centers alone are not enough. Connecting with the communities and building mutual trust is key to get the outbreak under control," says Roberto Wright, MSF anthropologist is Katwa. "We need to increase our efforts to engage the population as active participants in the fight against the outbreak. This includes listening to their broader needs. For instance, at the end of December 2018, we distributed trauma kits to local health centres to help their response to potential outbursts of violence. Likewise, our transit centres are not only there to identify Ebola patients and refer them for treatment, but also to ensure adequate care for other health issues, which is a clear need for this population. Visiting communities to present our activities before we actually launch them can go a long way in terms of improving mutual understanding and facilitating better collaboration in the long run."

[3] Virus spread: advancing towards major city
Date: Sat 19 Jan 2019
Source: Vox [abridged, edited]
https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/1/18/18188199/drc-ebola-outbreak


Health officials this week are concerned that Ebola appears to be spreading in the direction of Goma, a major population center in DRC.

Just this week, DRC's health ministry confirmed 4 cases of the deadly virus in Kayina, a town in North Kivu, where fighting among rebel and militia groups has repeatedly interrupted the painstaking work of health workers who are responding to the outbreak.

Kayina happens to be halfway between Butembo, currently one of the outbreak's most worrisome hotspots, and Goma, where a million people live.

So far, the outbreak has not affected DRC's biggest cities. But Ebola in Kayina "raises the alarm" for Ebola reaching Goma, Peter Salama, the head of the new Health Emergencies Program at the World Health Organization, told Vox on Fri 18 Jan 2019.

Goma is a major transportation hub, with roads and highways that lead to Rwanda. "These are crossroad cities and market towns," Salama added. People there are constantly on the move doing business, and also because of the insecurity in North Kivu. Ebola in Goma is a nightmare scenario WHO and DRC's health ministry are scrambling to prevent.

Together, they've deployed a rapid response team, including a vaccination team, to Kayina. And if the virus moves on to Goma, Salama says Ebola responders are ready. They've already mobilized teams there, set up a lab, and prepared health centers where sick people can be cared for in isolation.

But as Ebola expert Laurie Garrett wrote in Foreign Policy this week, Ebola in Goma could also trigger a rare global public health emergency declaration by WHO, escalating the severity of an already dangerous outbreak.

When Ebola strikes, it's like the worst and most humiliating flu you could imagine. People get the sweats, along with body aches and pains. Then they start vomiting and having uncontrollable diarrhea. They experience dehydration. These symptoms can appear anywhere between 2 and 21 days after exposure to the virus. Sometimes patients go into shock. In rare cases, they bleed.

The virus is spread through direct contact with the bodily fluids, like vomit, urine, or blood, of someone who is already sick and has symptoms. The sicker people get, and the closer to death, the more contagious they become. (That's why caring for the very ill and attending funerals are especially dangerous.)

Because we have no cure for Ebola, health workers use traditional public health measures: finding, treating, and isolating the sick, and breaking the chains of transmission so the virus stops spreading.

As of Fri 18 Jan 2019, the 2 biggest hotspots in the outbreak were Butembo, with 51 cases, and a neighboring city, Katwa, with 119 cases. But the outbreak is geographically dispersed. There are active Ebola cases in 12 of the country's "health zones," the districts around which the DRC's health system is organized. Because of the insecurity and difficulty reaching people, only 30-40 percent are coming from known contact lists, Salama said. That means the virus might already be in places no one has discovered yet.

African primates: likely victims, not reservoirs, of ebolaviruses

Abstract
Bats are considered a reservoir species for Ebola viruses, but non-human primates (NHP) have represented a source of infection in several outbreaks in humans. Here we report serological screening of blood or fecal samples from monkeys (n=2322) and apes (n=2327). 36 NHP species from Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo and Ivory Coast were tested with a sensitive and specific Luminex-based assay for IgG antibodies to 4 Ebolavirus species. Using the simultaneous presence of antibodies to NP and GP proteins to define positivity, we showed that specific Ebola virus antibodies are not widespread among NHP. Only one mustached monkey (_Cercopithecus cephus_) from Cameroon was positive for Sudan Ebola virus. These observations support that NHP are most likely intermediate hosts for Ebola viruses. With the increasing frequency of Ebola outbreaks, it is crucial to identify the animal reservoir and understand the ecology of Ebola viruses to inform disease control.

This paper discusses Ebola vaccines, not only for humans, but also considerations of potential ape vaccines to protect them from the devastating effects of Ebola on their populations. While they are intermediate hosts rather than reservoirs, Ebola virus is taking a great toll on endangered primates. - Mod.LK
