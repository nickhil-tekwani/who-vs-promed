From: Dr Harsha Sheorey <SHEOREHS@svhm.org.au>

A recent issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases 25:18-20, 1997, has the
latest list of viral taxonomy. Hepatitis E virus is classified under the
_Caliciviridae_ family, genus _Calicivirus_ along with Norwalk agents.
This along with other updated lists of microorganisms are very useful. We
always keep these handy in our lab manuals, as well as [for use [in
teaching.
