The 1st case of chikungunya, a vector borne disease caused by the
same mosquitoes which carry dengue virus, in the state has been
reported from Lucknow. A patient from Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Civil
Hospital, Apoorva, has tested positive for chikungunya [virus
infection]. This is the 1st case of the disease in the state in last
2 years. The report came from the samples collected by the central
team of doctors who had come to review the dengue situation in the
state last week [week of 25 Oct 2010]. The samples were sent to
National Center for Disease Control, New Delhi, for testing and the
reports were sent to the state government on Friday [29 Oct 2010].
"Though this is the 1st case in the state, we will be taking more
samples from the area where this case has been detected, and if the
virus is found to be spreading in the state, immediate steps will be
taken to control the disease," said Dr SP Ram, Director General,
Health and Family Welfare.

[This area has been experiencing cases of a recently reported
"mystery fever" with mortality. Dengue and malaria have been
implicated, but with very limited diagnostic testing. Chikungunya
virus infections may account for some fever cases, but not for the
mortality. This year (2010), there have been chikungunya virus
infections in Delhi, Tamil Nadu, and Maharashtra states.
