UK: Increase in Mumps Cases in England and Wales in 2004
--------------------------------------------------------
So far in 2004, 3696 cases of mumps have been confirmed in England and Wales
(weeks 1-39), compared with a [5-year cumulative] total of 3884 cases
between 1999 and 2003. All regions have reported cases in 2004, and all
except 2 have already had more cases this year than in the whole of 2003. Of
all cases this year, 78 percent (2886 cases) were reported in young people
aged 15-24.
Immunisation against mumps was introduced in England and Wales in October
1988 as a component of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine and
offered routinely to all children aged 12 to 15 months. A 2nd dose of MMR
vaccine at pre-school age was introduced in October 1996. Before the
introduction of MMR in 1988, mumps was not notifiable and surveillance was
based on laboratory reports. Since 1989, mumps has been notifiable and since
late 1994, the facility to test saliva for [mumps] IgM has been available to
family doctors.
Following the introduction of MMR, the incidence of mumps decreased rapidly
until 1997. Since then the number of confirmed cases has increased. In 2003,
there was a rise in notifications which has continued throughout 2004, with
further increases in the numbers of confirmed cases (illustrated as a figure
at URL above). A 2nd figure (also at URL above) shows the number of
confirmed mumps cases by year of birth in 2004 compared to previous years.
There is a slight shift in incidence in 2004 to the older cohorts.
This increase in mumps cases in England and Wales since 1997 was predicted
by seroprevalence studies in 1993. The results suggested that certain
cohorts had remained susceptible -- probably due to reduced exposure to
natural infection following high uptake of MMR vaccine [1][which would have
reinforced their vaccine-produced immunity. - Mod.JW]. The cohort identified
to be at particularly high risk of mumps were those who are too old to have
received 2 doses of MMR in the routine schedule (born before 1992) but young
enough to have grown up during a period of low incidence, and so have
escaped mumps infection in childhood. Confirmed mumps cases have been mainly
in older teenagers and young adults (born between 1982 and 1990), and
outbreaks have moved from being mainly in secondary schools to universities
and further education colleges. Many of this group received measles-rubella
(MR) vaccine in 1994, as at that time there was a shortage of MMR. Some may
not recall that the 1994 vaccine campaign was not the MMR vaccine, and so
they are not protected against mumps.
The Health Protection Agency and the Department of Health recommend that all
school-leavers and university entrants who have not received MMR vaccine or
who have only received one dose should have the opportunity to get MMR.

Many universities across England and Wales have experienced outbreaks of
mumps this year and have organised institution-based vaccination campaigns.
