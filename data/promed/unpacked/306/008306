A further 27 cattle from a Co. Monaghan farm have tested positive for the banned substance clenbuterol, also known as angel dust, after further tests were carried out by the Department of Agriculture.

Last month, the Department said that it had launched an investigation after an animal, which was processed through ABP Clones, tested positive for the growth promoter after a random sample was taken as part of the National Residue Control Program.

The Department has confirmed that 27 animals, which were on the holding as part of the overall herd, tested positive and were destroyed. According to the Department the Food Safety Authority of Ireland is fully aware of this investigation and has concluded that there is no risk to public health arising thereof.

Pending the completion of the investigation, all animals on the farm have been placed under restriction. It is understood that the Department of Agriculture's Special Investigations Unit raided the farm following the positive result and seized a large quantity of the drug.

Some 13 animals tested positive for the use of growth promoters in 2014 and figures released by the Department of Agriculture for 2014 - the most up to date full year figures - show that 13 bovine and farm game samples tested positive for the substance, Thiouracil, which may indicate the potential use of growth promoters covered by the EU Hormone Ban. Some 0.22 percent of animals in 2014 tested positive under the National Residue Control Plan (NRCP), figures from the Department show.

Meanwhile, the identification of angel dust in a beef animal by the Department of Agriculture and the subsequent traceability actions demonstrate the effectiveness of the food safety regulatory system, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) has said. The FSAI has confirmed that it has carried out a risk assessment in relation to this incident and that this incident related to 1 cow.

[The following commentary by Mod.TG is copied from 20130526.1738283:

Clenbuterol is a sympathomimetic amine that has a number of different activities. It has smooth muscle relaxing properties, which means it can relax bronchioles and be effective in the treatment of asthma and asthma-like conditions. Clenbuterol is sold as a clenbuterol hydrochloride for treatment of asthma and other restrictive respiratory conditions.

Clenbuterol is a beta-2 agonist. This drug directs the body to make lean muscle instead of fat. It has been used by body builders and various athletes in an attempt to gain a competitive advantage. It has also been used in cattle, pork, sheep, and goats to gain a competitive advantage in livestock shows as they appear more muscled.

Over the last several Olympic competitions various athletes have tested positive for clenbuterol and have been suspended by the various athletic committees and competition organizations. A few athletes have challenged the level found in the urine, because of extremely low levels. Such a level may indicate that it was in the food they consumed.

Clenbuterol has a very long half-life and can be found in various locations in the body of animals or humans long (months) after consumption. Clenbuterol residues can affect lung and heart function in persons who have eaten liver or meat of animals given the drug. In the United States, no human illnesses have been associated with clenbuterol use in food animals. But, several outbreaks of reversible, short-term illnesses in Europe have been traced to ingesting clenbuterol residues in European beef liver.

No deaths were reported in several European incidents involving the consumption of liver with clenbuterol residues. Spain reported 2 outbreaks of illness in 1990 totaling 135 persons who consumed contaminated beef liver. Samples had clenbuterol concentrations of 160 to 291 parts per billion. The people were hospitalized with reversible symptoms of increased heart rate, muscular tremors, headache, nausea, fever, and chills. Clenbuterol was suspected, but not confirmed, as the cause of an earlier outbreak of illness, also in Spain. A similar incident with 22 cases, also traced to beef liver, was reported from France. Clenbuterol was also a concern in Ireland in 1991.

Although the toxic effects of clenbuterol residues have been described as mild, FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) considers all unintended effects on humans to be unacceptable. FDA said it is possible that persons being treated with adrenergic agents or who are otherwise sensitive to these drugs may be far more severely affected by residues of clenbuterol than are normal, healthy individuals.

The FDA is also concerned that the illicit use of clenbuterol could lead to illness or death in persons handling the drug. FDA said it is possible that clenbuterol effects on the cardiovascular system may be more hazardous via occupational inhalation exposure than via ingestion in food. But FDA said it has not been able to confirm reports of such reactions.

While some of this has relatively historical sound to it, the drug is very much in use, illegally in the animal performance shows. It is, by evidence in athletic arenas, a problem among some human athletes. Sadly, many of these human competitors do not realize that they could suffer heart disease that may not be reversible.
