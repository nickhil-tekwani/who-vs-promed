Saudi Arabia confirmed one cholera case and said 3 others were suspected in an area bordering Yemen, where an epidemic has killed more than 2000 people, Saudi state TV said, citing a health ministry official. The report late on Sun 16 Sep 2018, said the patients, identified only as non-Saudis, were receiving care at al-Mauwassem General Hospital in Jizan, about 1000 km (620 miles) southwest of the capital, Riyadh. It was unclear if the outbreak was linked to Yemen or to last month's [August 2018] Muslim haj pilgrimage, which draws some 2 million foreigners each year, raising the risk of the spread of infectious disease.

Saudi Arabia reported 5 cases of cholera in 2017, all of which were imported, and there was no further spread, according to the WHO.

The WHO said the origin of the current cases was not yet known but the outbreak was not expected to spread given Saudi Arabia's infrastructure. "Infectious diseases have no borders, and cholera is no different," spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told Reuters. "Saudi Arabia has extensive measures in place to manage health issues during the haj, and has been able to prevent outbreaks by making sure that pilgrims to the haj have adequate water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities."

Cholera - Algeria
-----------------
On 23 Aug 2018, the Algerian Ministry of Health (MoH) announced an outbreak of cholera in northern parts of the country, in and around the capital province Algiers. From 7 Aug 2018 to 6 Sep 2018, 217 cases with cholera-like symptoms have been hospitalized, 2 of the patients died (CFR: 0.9%). Cases have been reported from 7 provinces (wilayas). Of these, 83 have been confirmed as _Vibrio cholerae_ serogroup O1 Ogawa at the Institut Pasteur Algiers. More than half of the confirmed cases have been registered in Blida Province, followed by Algiers, Tipaza, Bouira, Medea, and Ain Defla.

A total of 21, including 3 private, water sources in the affected areas were tested for bacterial contamination, and 10 of these were deemed inappropriate for human consumption. One of the water sources tested positive for _V. cholerae_ and was condemned for human consumption.

Public health response
----------------------
The MoH has reported there is sufficient capacity within the hospitals to treat the cholera patients. Patients are being treated at 2 provincial hospitals in the affected areas. According to the information from the MoH as of 3 Sep 2018, 10 cases remained hospitalized. The remaining cases have been discharged.

Surveillance and active case searching around the identified cases are ongoing and have been intensified by the MoH.

The public water supply in Algeria is tested on a daily basis; all samples collected have tested negative for enteric pathogens.

Following a request from Institut Pasteur Algiers, WHO sent 5000 rapid diagnostic tests to Algeria.

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
Cholera is an acute enteric infection caused by the ingestion of water or food contaminated with _V. cholerae_ bacteria. Cholera is a potentially serious infectious disease and can cause high rates of morbidity and mortality. It has the potential to spread rapidly, depending on the frequency of exposure, the population exposed, and the context.

The last confirmed case of _V. cholerae_ infection in Algeria was reported in 1996. The current outbreak developed rapidly with 41 confirmed cases reported between 7 and 23 Aug 2018, and an average of 4 cases reported daily from 24 to 30 Aug 2018. The source of the outbreak and transmission vehicle is currently not known but the MoH and Institut Pasteur Algeria reported that most of the cases were clustered within a family group.

Cases have been reported in an urban setting where there is an increased risk of transmission, especially as the source of the outbreak has not been identified and therefore the source may still persist as a risk in the community. However, the most recent information published by the MoH suggests that the outbreak is receding.

WHO advice
----------
For this outbreak, further analysis of the laboratory-confirmed specimens is recommended, including sequencing for the cholera toxin gene, to identify if the outbreak is due to an epidemic strain of _V. cholerae_.

For preventing and controlling cholera, WHO recommends proper waste management, implementing adequate food safety and hygienic practices and ensuring access to safe water and sanitation. Key public health messages should be provided to the affected population.

Reinforcement of surveillance is advised. Appropriate case management should be implemented in the areas affected by the outbreak to decrease mortality. Ensuring national preparedness to rapidly detect and respond to the cholera outbreak will be needed to mitigate the risk of spread to new areas.

WHO advises against any restrictions on travel or trade to Algeria based on the information currently available in relation to this outbreak.

[ProMED thanks Dr Folkers for communicating the WHO post regarding Algeria.

The Saudi cases are most likely directly or indirectly related to the outbreak of cholera across the border in Yemen. The Source of the Algerian cases is unclear since prior to this outbreak the last reported case in the country occurred more than 20 years before. - Mod.LL
