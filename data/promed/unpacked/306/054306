As the calendar continues its march toward the opening of Virginia's deer
hunting season, the serious outbreak of epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD)
continues its march across the state. The disease is suspected to have
killed deer in 26 counties, and the state's wildlife veterinarian expects
the number of affected counties to keep climbing.
This year's [2007] EHD outbreak is unique in a couple of ways, Dr Jonathan
Sleeman of the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries was cited
as noting. It started much earlier than normal, with the 1st reported case
coming in late July [2007]. Usually, EHD doesn't appear until September.
Also unusual, but not surprising, is the intensity with which it has hit
counties in the western part of the state.
Maintaining an accurate body count is difficult. Sleeman was cited as
saying he has gotten more than 50 separate reports, and that those reports
account for at least 200 dead deer. But those reports certainly don't
include every deer that has died.
Having firmly established EHD as the cause of the deaths, Sleeman was cited
as saying the state is no longer testing deer for EHD or investigating
reports of sick or dying deer in person.
