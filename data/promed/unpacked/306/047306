Specific identification of coconut tinangaja viroid
Tinangaja is a lethal disease of coconut palm which was first described
in 1917 in Guam. This disease resembles coconut cadang-cadang which
occurs in the Philippines and is caused by coconut cadang-cadang viroid
(CCCVd - EPPO A1 quarantine pest).
Coconut tinangaja viroid (CTiVd) is associated with tinangaja disease,
although it has not been verified that inoculation of this viroid causes the
disease. These two viroids although similar (65% homology) are distinct.
It is reported that since the early outbreaks of tinangaja, coconut groves
have been neglected on Guam, and the disease has not been considered
as economically important. However, a high incidence of tinangaja has
again been observed in some areas of Guam. Therefore, there is a need
for adequate diagnostic methods to understand better the epidemiology
of the disease and develop control measures.
A method has been developed to detect and identify CTiVd in leaf
samples. Detection is based on extraction from plant tissues followed
by agarose gel electrophoresis. Confirmation of the identity of CTiVd
(and also detection of low levels of viroid) is achieved by using
molecular techniques (DOP-hybridization (diagnostic oligonucleotide
probe) or RT-PCR). This procedure can also be used for CCCVd, and
oligoprobes designed to be specific for either CCCVd and CTiVd can
distinguish between the two viroids in coconut leaf extracts.
