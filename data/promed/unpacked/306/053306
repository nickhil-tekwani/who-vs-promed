Increased Severity and Spread of _Mycobacterium ulcerans_, Southeastern Australia.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tai AYC, Athan E, Friedman ND, Hughes A, Walton A and O'Brien DP.

Abstract
---------
"Reported cases of _Mycobacterium ulcerans_ disease (Buruli ulcer) have been increasing in southeastern Australia and spreading into new geographic areas. We analyzed 426 cases of _M. ulcerans_ disease during January 1998-May 2017 in the established disease-endemic region of the Bellarine Peninsula and the emerging endemic region of the Mornington Peninsula. A total of 20.4 percent of cases patients had severe disease. Over time, there has been an increase in the number of cases managed per year and the proportion associated with severe disease. Risk factors associated with severe disease included age, time period (range of years of diagnosis), and location of lesions over a joint. We highlight the changing epidemiology and pathogenicity of _M. ulcerans_ disease in Australia. Further research, including genomic studies of emergent strains with increased pathogenicity, is urgently needed to improve the understanding of this disease to facilitate implementation of effective public health measures to halt its spread."

Introduction
------------
"_Mycobacterium ulcerans_ causes a necrotizing disease of skin and soft tissue known as Bairnsdale or Daintree ulcer in Australia and Buruli ulcer worldwide. The pathogenesis of _M. ulcerans_ is driven by production of mycolactone, a polyketide-derived macrolide that triggers apoptotic cell death (1). The clinical spectrum of _M. ulcerans_ disease ranges from usually painless nodules or ulcers on the limbs, to more severe forms of the disease, including edematous lesions (2). More severe disease has major implications for patients in terms of increased illness and long-term deformities, more complicated and prolonged treatments, and increased treatment costs (3,4). The World Health Organization (WHO) classification system classifies _M. ulcerans_ disease by severity: category 1 represents mild disease, and categories 2 and 3 represent more severe disease (5). The disease is classified as a WHO neglected tropical disease and has become a major public health issue in sub-Saharan Africa and Australia.

In the state of Victoria in Australia, _M. ulcerans_ disease was 1st observed in the Bairnsdale District in the 1930s and is now established on the Bellarine Peninsula (6). In recent years, the epidemiology of _M. ulcerans_ disease in southern Victoria has noticeably changed, with rapidly increasing numbers of human cases reported per year and expansion into new geographic areas, including the Mornington Peninsula, an adjacent area with previously few cases (7). The reasons for this expansion are unknown but might be related to changing climate, population expansion, human activities, or a complex zoonotic cycle involving possums (8,9).

Discussion
----------
"The findings of our study suggest a serious change in the epidemiology of _M. ulcerans_ disease in southeastern Australia. There appears to be an increase in the proportion of severe cases in recent years, with a near doubling compared with earlier time periods to 25 percent of all case-patients who came to our health service during 2011-2017. More severe disease has major implications: case-patients with severe disease frequently require surgical treatment with tissue reconstruction (2) and hospitalization, and often have long-term deformities (4). Severe disease also causes major increases in cost of treatment (3). This finding is in contrast to non-severe disease, which can usually be managed with oral antimicrobial drugs; outpatients have shown good outcomes (12-14). We also report a large proportion of severe cases that affected 1 of 5 patients in our cohort. However, these rates are lower than those reported for cohorts in Africa, in which the proportion of cases with severe disease (WHO categories 2 and 3 combined) was over 70 percent (15-17). It has been postulated that strains in Africa are more virulent because of production of increased quantities and more potent forms of mycolactone (18).

"The reason for the increasing proportion of severe cases in recent years is not clear but might be related to evolution of a more pathogenic strain of _M. ulcerans_ in the region. In the area of _M. ulcerans_ research, utility of whole-genome sequencing has been studied from an ecologic and epidemiologic perspective. Studies indicate a strong relationship between the genotype of an isolate and the geographic origin of disease at a national and regional level (19-21). However, there is no information available on the relationship between the genotype of an isolate and the clinical severity of disease in affected patients."

"Other possible explanations for the increased proportion of severe cases of _M. ulcerans_ disease could include environmental or climatic changes, which lead to a higher inoculum of organisms. In addition, there might have been a change in population dynamics or characteristics that make humans more susceptible to severe disease (23). Although human populations in disease-endemic regions are steadily increasing, these increases are not sufficient to explain the rapid increase in reported cases, and additional studies of these factors are needed.

"Our analysis suggested that there was no major difference in the proportion of severe cases of _M. ulcerans_ disease reported between the 2 peninsulas. This finding is consistent with our understanding of restricted genetic diversity of _M. ulcerans_ from the same geographic location (20,24). A recent study of isolates from 11 disease-endemic countries in Africa identified only 2 specific _M. ulcerans_ lineages; these lineages were subdivided into 4 major clusters, and most of these isolates were in cluster 1 (25). The spread of disease across both peninsulas in our study region, given their close geographic proximity, probably resulted from clonal expansion of the same genotype. This hypothesis is consistent with findings of a study of isolates from Australia in which 1 isolate from Frankston (Mornington Peninsula) had genomic sequences similar to those for isolates from Point Lonsdale and St. Leonards (Bellarine Peninsula) (20).

"Apart from time period, we have identified 2 risk factors for severe _M. ulcerans_ disease: a lesion situated over a joint, and age. The reason for more severe disease occurring over joints is not clear. Reduced skin and subcutaneous tissue and the absence of muscle compared with adjacent regions might lead to lower tissue temperatures and increased growth of organisms (26,27). In addition, these factors might facilitate spread across tissue planes, and a reduced blood flow in the absence of muscle might relatively reduce local immune function. In contrast, increased tissue movement and physical stress over joints might increase lymph flow in the region and enhance spread of the infection, such as that hypothesized for hand, foot and mouth disease (28,29).

"Our finding of older (over 65 years) age as a risk factor for severe _M. ulcerans_ disease is consistent with our previous studies that demonstrated that these patients were more likely to have multiple lesions or be categorized into WHO category 3 (30). This finding might be related to reduced immunity in patients in older age groups. Reduced immunity inhibits control of the mycobacterium and results in larger, more severe forms of _M. ulcerans_ disease, which is similar to immunosuppressive effects of HIV (31). Reduced immunity in elderly persons might also be related to an increased prevalence of other concurrent conditions. Likewise, our study findings suggest that children might be at increased risk for severe disease, which might be related to relative immune suppression in an immune system that is still developing.

"We found that, similar to findings from Africa (32), more prolonged signs and symptoms before diagnosis were not associated with severe disease. Therefore, severe disease is not directly related to a delay in diagnosis, as is often believed.

"With the increasing number and severity of cases of _M. ulcerans_ disease in Victoria, public health measures to prevent the disease are needed, although these measured are hampered because the environmental reservoir and mode of transmission of _M. ulcerans_ are unknown. Current recommendations involve mosquito and insect bite preventive strategies, given some evidence that mosquitoes or another vector might be responsible for transmission (33,34). There is evidence of reduced risk for disease for persons outdoors in disease-endemic areas who reported regular use of insect repellent (35). In addition, sleeping under bed nets in Africa has been associated with a reduced incidence of disease (36). Possums have been postulated as a potential environmental reservoir in Australia (8,9), and more research is needed on the role of possums in the epidemiology of human _M. ulcerans_ disease."

"The epidemiology and pathogenicity of _M. ulceransÂ¬_ disease in southeastern Australia is changing rapidly; we observed increases in numbers of cases per year and disease severity. Risk factors for severe disease include age, time period, and lesions located over a joint. Reasons for the changing epidemiology and pathogenicity are unknown but these factors urgently need to be identified and addressed to halt spread of this increasingly devastating disease."

[The Bellarine, on the west and Mornington, on the east, are peninsulas that surround Port Phillip Bay, on which the city of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, is located. The 2 peninsulas are separated by a narrow inlet, called The Rip, 3.5 km (2.1 mi) wide (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rip). The Mornington Peninsula is primarily a local tourist region, with small towns on its western shorelines that are sometimes regarded as outlying suburbs of greater Melbourne (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mornington_Peninsula). Most of the Bellarine peninsula is a part of the city of Greater Geelong (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellarine_Peninsula).

Buruli ulcer is a chronic skin and soft tissue infection due to _Mycobacterium ulcerans_ that can lead to adjacent bone infection and permanent disfigurement and disability. Buruli ulcer has been reported in over 30 countries, usually with tropical and subtropical climates; except in the Bellarine and Mornington peninsulas, which have a temperate climate. Pictures of Buruli ulcers, and a map of Australia that indicates hot spots where the incidence of Buruli ulcer has been reported to be increasing, can be found at https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1643576/zombie-flesh-eating-bug-is-spreading-across-australia-as-insect-bites-lead-to-volcanic-wounds-and-amputations/.
