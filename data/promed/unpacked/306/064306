[Ref. (07) below gives more up-to-date totals for Brazil: 38 confirmed
cases and 14 confirmed deaths. The monkeys on the Colombian border seem to
have been good sentinels of a sylvan outbreak. This the first report of YF
from Peru since mid-2001. These outbreaks could lead at any time to urban
outbreaks in major cities. Travelers to these and all endemic countries
should be vaccinated. - Mod.JW]
