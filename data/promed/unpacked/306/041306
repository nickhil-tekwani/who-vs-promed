[With continued incidence of avian influenza due to existing and new influenza A(H5) viruses in poultry, there is a need to remain vigilant in the animal and public health sectors. Community awareness of the potential dangers for human health is essential to prevent infection in humans.

Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected.

Even though there is no confirmation of the disease in poultry, other people with possible contact should be traced and followed up as well as those in contact with the human case to rule out the possibility of human-to-human transmission.

As per the IHR (2005) decision instrument for the assessment and notification of events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern, a case of human influenza caused by a new subtype is unusual or unexpected and may have serious public health impacts, and thus shall be notified to WHO (https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241580496). - Mod.UBA
