Night blindness is a new symptom of Chagas disease
--------------------------------------------------
Researchers in Argentina have determined that night blindness is a new
clinical symptom of Chagas disease. A team led by Howard Hughes Medical
Institute (HHMI) international research scholar Mariano Jorge Levin and
Cristina Paveto of the Institute for Genetic Engineering and Molecular Biology
(INGEBI), National Research Council, National Council of Scientific Research
and Technology in Buenos Aires [Argentina, found that the immune system of
individuals with the tropical disease can shut down a key reaction in the
retina, causing night blindness.
"This is a new observation, a new clinical symptom of Chagas disease," said
Levin, head of the Laboratory of the Molecular Biology of Chagas Disease at
the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Levin and colleagues report their
findings in the March 2006 issue of the FASEB Journal.
Chagas disease affects people living in regions of Latin America where insects
[known as "barbeiros" or "kissing bugs". - Mod.JW] carrying the parasite
_Trypanosoma cruzi_ thrive in crowded and substandard housing. At night, the
insects emerge and bite, transferring the Chagas parasite into a new host.
Their victims are often children. After an acute infection characterized by
swollen eyelids, those infected usually feel better. But the parasite remains
active inside them, in a chronic phase of infection, quietly invading cells
and stimulating the immune system. As a result, people can develop heart and
gastrointestinal problems months or years after being infected. Some 30 000
people die each year from Chagas disease, according to the World Health
Organization, but the number of people who are carrying latent infections is
unknown.
"We now know that Chagas patients may have trouble seeing at night,"
said Levin. "And this gives us additional motivation to improve
conditions for people living in areas where Chagas disease is common."
Silvia Matsumoto, a physician from the Dr. Teodoro Alvarez Hospital
in Buenos Aires and 1st author of the paper, conducted thorough eye
examinations of 45 Chagas disease patients with heart problems. She
found that under bright conditions, the Chagas patients performed
comparably to 50 healthy control individuals. But in the dark, 37 of
45 (82 percent) Chagas patients had trouble seeing with at least one
eye, and 19 of 45 (42 percent) had trouble with both eyes.
It turns out that molecular mimicry can also upset the delicate
machinery inside retinal cells. Levin and his team found that
antibodies geared to attack _T. cruzi_ also block rhodopsin, a
molecule that converts light into electrical impulses sent to the
brain.
Levin said that Chagas patients' vision problems are caused
exclusively by the antibodies that block rhodopsin, and not by
inflammation. "In the hearts of Chagas patients, we see scarring,
because there is a complex reaction that causes inflammation," he
said. "But there are no such scars in the eyes of Chagas patients
with reduced vision. No one knew about the night blindness, so we
don't know, for instance, whether Chagas patients have more accidents
at night," Levin added. "That's one of many ideas to explore now. The
research also points out that we need new drugs or vaccines to stop
the parasite, and at a social level, it stresses the need to improve
living conditions of Chagas patients, particularly those living in
rural areas."

[The study describes a new clinical symptom in patients infected with
_Trypanozoma cruzi_. More clinical studies are now needed to confirm
the results showing that as many as 80 percent of patients with the
infection may have impaired night vision. The finding underlines the
need for control of the infection at community level and treatment of
cases even if apparently asymptomatic. - Mod.EP]

These are probably North American species, but they look a lot like their
Latin American relatives. - Mod.JW]
