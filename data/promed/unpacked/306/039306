The national reference laboratory (NRL) for bluetongue (BT) at the Animal Health Laboratory (ANSES), Maisons-Alfort, may have isolated a new serotype of bluetongue virus [BTV] in Corsica.

In early May 2014, the NRL received 56 blood samples from goats kept in a breeding center in Corsica, for routine check before returning the animals to their original farms. These animals showed no clinical signs of bluetongue. Following their testing, 51 of them were found positive for bluetongue (RT-PCR group test) which detects BTV in the general sense (any serotype). Specific test (RT-PCR typing) targeting serotype 1, which is currently circulating in Corsica, was negative. Similarly, the tests were negative for the serotypes 2, 4, 8, 9, and 16). It should be said that negative PCR typing tests despite presence of the antigen may sometimes occur, especially when the amount of virus in the sample is too low. However, such cases are rare, and not consistent with the fact that in the current case, a large number of samples were found positive for BTV.

The NRL has conducted sequencing of the virus, revealing the presence of segments of different genes of all known serotypes of bluetongue.

It would therefore be potentially a "serotype 27" BTV, new and never seen before (so far, 26 serotypes have been described).

According to the sequencing results, it seems unlikely that this new variant results from a mutation of serotype 1. However, this serotype presents strong genetic similarities with serotype 25 virus (Toggenburg, derived from asymptomatic goats, Switzerland 2008) and to a lesser extent with serotype 26, identified in 2010 in Kuwait.

Further analysis should be undertaken to confirm that the identified genetic characteristics are associated with biological characteristics (criterion to confirm the existence of a new serotype).

Little information is available at this stage on the biology of this new potential virus (prevalence, virulence, transmission mode, etc.). However, several factors lead us to believe that its virulence is low:

1. at this stage, there is no evidence of clinical signs in the 50 infected goats;
2. this virus was ruled out in 4 goat populations currently subject to extensive investigations by ANSES and the Regional Animal Health Protection because of unusual health problems observed at the end of winter 2014; all animals tested were found negative by RT-PCR group test;
3. Toggenburg virus (serotype 25), identified in 2008 in Switzerland in goats, with which the new serotype has high genetic similarity, does not cause clinical disease.

Investigations and additional experiments will be introduced to:
i) confirm that it is a new serotype;
ii) determine the current prevalence of this potential new serotype in the Corsican farms;
iii) attempt to trace the history of its presence in Corsica (the virus may be present for a long time or has recently been introduced);
iv) evaluate the infectivity and virulence of this serotype, including experimental infection trials in a high biosafety level (A3) facility.

The 1st results could be obtained in the course of summer 2014.

At this stage, given the lack of knowledge on this new serotype, the animals have been declared as infected and will be kept in the farm where they are held. Control measures to be applied with regard to this new serotype will be determined in light of the results of investigations to be conducted. The presence of this serotype does not change the status of Corsica ("restricted area") and mainland France ("free") with regard to bluetongue disease.

[Tables listing recent isolates of the 26 known BTV serotypes are available at http://www.reoviridae.org/dsRNA_virus_proteins/ReoID/BTV-isolates.htm. The collection of the 26 serotypes at Pirbright is available at http://www.reoviridae.org/dsRNA_virus_proteins/ReoID/BTV-Nos.htm#BTV-26.

Results of further investigations addressing the goat-related strain described above, and particularly its potential infectivity and pathogenicity in ruminants are anticipated with interest.

Traditionally, Corsica shares its BTV serotypes with neighbouring Sardinia. It will be interesting to note if the described (new?) virus is detected there as well. - Mod.AS
