Foot And Mouth Disease Breakout, MPs Ask Government To Vaccinate
----------------------------------------------------------------
MPs have directed government to avail funds for procurement of vaccination drugs to vaccinate livestock in the country due to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease [FMD].
The most hit areas are reported in western region where animals are dying at high rates.

MPs, Dr. Chris Baryomunsi, Theodro Sekikubo Harriet Ntabazi, Dr.Merdad Bitekyerezo and Naom Kasharira told parliament that foot and mouth disease and other live stock diseases have spread in their areas and they need government intervention.

MPs said that the disease will affect people's earnings since they will not be able to sell the livestock products.

MPs asked government to set up a Veterinary Drugs Authority to screen the fake drugs that are on the market and sold to farmers and are not effective in controlling livestock diseases.

Aswa County Member of Parliament, Regan Okumu said that government should improve on the payment of veterinary officers to avoid them being bribed for the movement of affected animals to other areas.

The minister of State for Animal, Bright Rwamirama said that government will procure drugs for vaccination of the affected animals.

Areas worst hit by FMD include Lwemiyaga, Kabula, Sembabule , Ntongamo, Ankole , Kamwenge , Kyegegwa, among others.

[Uganda is regarded FMD-endemic. In previous years, the following serotypes were identified in domestic animals: O, A, SAT-1 and SAT-2. FMDV SAT-3 ws identified in African Buffaloes only. In its annual report for 2011, Uganda reported 20 outbreaks caused by FMDV-O.

According to the Uganda page of the WRLFMD, all three SAT types are probably endemic in the African buffalo population.

The areas reported in the above newswire as currently seriously affected are situated in the south-western part of the country. Information on the serotype(s) involved and the situation in other regions will be helpful. - Mod.AS
