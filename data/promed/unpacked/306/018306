A guide dog stepped off a Channel ferry and into history yesterday when it
became the first dog in more than a century legally to leave and re-enter
Britain without being detained in quarantine. Aden, a 5-year-old Alsatian,
was the first animal to return to the country under the terms of the pilot
Pet Travel Scheme, which will come into general operation on 28 Feb 2000.
Aden's owner, Trevor Ireland, a former Royal Marine commando, went blind
after suffering injuries in the Normandy Campaign.
Mr Ireland fought for 5 years for permission to take the dog abroad without
the need for a 6-month stay in quarantine. Last month he was granted a
dispensation allowing him to do so 3 weeks before the rest of the country.
Yesterday Mr Ireland and Aden were greeted at Portsmouth by Royal Marines
buglers and Ministry of Agriculture officials after a 5-day visit to
France. Aden was subjected to a brief check by a ministry veterinarian
before being allowed home. Mr. Ireland, 78, from Porthmadog,
[Veterinarian? Gwynedd, said: "It's a wonderful day and we're so proud
Aden has made this landmark. I'm sure many guide dog owners will want to
take advantage of the scheme when it comes into force."
During his annual visits to Normandy over the last 15 years Mr. Ireland had
to rely on his wife, Kate, and friends to guide him around. But with Aden
present he went unaided to visit memorials to the dead of 48 Commando and
the scenes of the unit's battles. He said: "It was all about independence.
My friends have their own things to do, and my wife suffers from
Parkinson's, so I would find myself stuck. Aden being there meant I could
do my own thing."
A spokesman for the ministry said: "We are very pleased Mr. Ireland has
been able to use the Pet Travel Scheme early. Pet owners intending to use
the scheme should check the details to ensure they comply with its terms."
Roger Bailey, of the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association also welcomed Mr.
Ireland off the ferry. He was accompanied by his own guide dog. He said:
"The scheme means we can extend the potential of guide dogs by having them
go where they could not go before. I anticipate a great deal of interest."
The pilot scheme will operate for 1 year before a decision is taken on
whether to extend it. Only cats and dogs traveling to specified Western
European countries are eligible. The animals must be injected with an
identifying microchip, vaccinated against rabies, blood-tested and issued
with a certificate. They must also be checked by a veterinarian in the
country they visit and vaccinated against tapeworm and ticks not more than
48 hours and not less than 24 hours before returning to Britain. Animals
can also be subject to spot-checks by ministry veterinarians on British
soil, and may be sent into quarantine if illnesses develop.

[This is a vast improvement over the system the British have employed for
so long. Service dogs and working dogs in many roles will benefit. It was
quite sad the search and rescue dogs deployed to help in the tragedies in
Turkey were subject to the quarantine procedure. These animals suffer a
loss of conditioning and training, and diminishing of skills. The
specialized services may be needed before the quarantine time has expired.
So the change in policy should benefit all types of service dogs, working
dogs, companion animals and owners. Mod TG
