RICE HOJA BLANCA & RICE STRIPE VIRUSES: REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE
**************************************************************
A ProMED-mail post
From: Lawrence G. Brown <brownlg@grove.ufl.edu>
Date: Monday 13 October 1997

The Florida Department of Agriculture, Division of Plant Industry needs a
test in Bermuda grass (_Cynodon dactylon_) for rice hoja blanca Tenuivirus
and rice stripe Tenuivirus. A serological test for rice stripe in rice
(not Bermuda grass) has been found but no diagnostic test (other than host
range) has been found for hoja blanca in rice or Bermuda grass. The
Philippine government is requiring a Florida producer to test Bermuda grass
for hoja blanca and rice stripe tenuiviruses. The Florida producer wishes
to ship grass to the Philippines to establish a golf course. The VIDE
database lists Bermuda grass as an experimental host (not a natural host)
of rice stripe virus but the database does not list Bermuda grass as even
an experimental host of rice hoja blanca. Can anyone advise us on the best
way to meet the requirements of the Philippine government so that the
Bermuda grass can be shipped there?
[The spirit behind the Philippine government's request is quite
understandable; they are concerned with protecting their basic staple food
crop from the introduction of exotic rice viruses. However, rice stripe
virus Tenuivirus (RSV) has not been reported from the Americas. The only
rice tenuivirus known from the Western Hemisphere is rice hoja blanca
Tenuivirus (RHBV). Thus, the request to test for RSV puzzles me. Dr.
Francisco Morales, of the CIAT virology unit, does have a serological test
for RHBV. As neither RHBV nor RSV is seed transmitted, I assume that the
Philippine request is based on the desire to ship propagative planting
material? Then, the real question here is what would the appropriate
indexing procedure for the amount of turf to be shipped? Can any of our
subscribers share information and experience on developing appropriate
indexing procedures for this kind of (bulky) propagative material? -
