There has been a significant rise recently in the number of children hospitalized with pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (PIMS), a rare condition that develops in some children, after exposure to the coronavirus, Channel 12 news reported on Sunday [10 Oct 2021]. Since the beginning of the month [October 2021], 35 children have been hospitalized with the syndrome, including a boy aged 6 and a 6-month-old baby.

The report came the day after a 16-year-old boy died from complications caused by PIMS. [AJF], a resident of the central town of Jaljulia, was believed to be the 1st recorded fatality in Israel from PIMS since the syndrome was identified.

Itai Pessach, director of the Safra Children's Hospital at the Sheba Medical Center, explained to Channel 12 that the syndrome is still rare and only shows up in around one case for every 10 000 children who are infected with COVID-19. The relative spike, he assessed, was because of a wave of coronavirus infections, the 4th the country has seen, that began waning over the past couple of weeks.

Pessach said parents can identify the symptoms -- which include persistent fever and serious inflammation -- because suffering children are clearly unwell, and the illness shows up starting 2-4 weeks after recovery from COVID-19. PIMS, he said, comes from the over-activation of the body's immune system to the coronavirus, causing the body to attack itself. There is a treatment that helps the immune system to calm down, and the sooner it is given the better, Pessach said.

"The phenomenon shows up more commonly in children aged 6-16," explained Prof. Yehuda Adler, a senior cardiologist. Symptoms can also include high temperature, stomach pains, and headache, he said. "This can rapidly lead to a need for intensive care and to various organs in the body not functioning," Adler said.

So far, there have been at least 120 cases in Israel of PIMS, although the figure could be higher, Channel 12 reported. According to Prof. Zachi Grossman, president of the Israel Pediatric Association, 100 children have been hospitalized in serious condition with the syndrome.

Also on Sunday [10 Oct 2021], a senior health official addressed claims by some women who have received COVID-19 vaccines that the shots caused a change in their monthly menstrual cycle. Dr. Sharon Alroy-Preis, head of the Health Ministry's public health department, said that there could be a connection between COVID vaccination and changes in menstrual cycles, but that the subject needs further clarification.

Speaking at a ministry gathering of university health researchers, Alroy-Preis stressed that it is a temporary phenomenon and that by the following month women naturally return to their previous schedule. She also noted that, according to the Israel Fertility Association, vaccination does not influence fertility at all. Alroy-Preis said the Health Ministry has received only a few dozen reports of such a phenomenon.

Health Ministry figures released on Sunday [10 Oct 2021] showed 1029 new COVID-19 cases diagnosed a day earlier, the lowest such figure since July, although testing tends to be lower over the weekends. The positivity rate dropped below 2% for the 1st time since late July [2021].

There were 448 virus patients in serious condition, of which 336 were unvaccinated, the statistics showed. Since the start of the pandemic last year [2020], 7912 people have died of COVID-19 in Israel.

["Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) [or PIMS] is a serious condition that appears to be linked to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Most children who become infected with the COVID-19 virus have only a mild illness. But in children who go on to develop MIS-C, some organs and tissues -- such as the heart, lungs, blood vessels, kidneys, digestive system, brain, skin or eyes -- become severely inflamed. Signs and symptoms depend on which areas of the body are affected.

"MIS-C is considered a syndrome -- a group of signs and symptoms, not a disease -- because much is unknown about it, including its cause and risk factors. Identifying and studying more children who have MIS-C may help to eventually find a cause. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health are working with doctors and researchers across the country to learn more about risk factors for MIS-C, share data, and improve diagnosis and treatment of MIS-C."

"MIS-C is rare, and most children who have it eventually get better with medical care. But some kids rapidly get worse, to the point where their lives are at risk" (https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mis-c-in-kids-covid-19/symptoms-causes/syc-20502550). - Mod.LK]

[2] Predicting COVID severity in children
Date: Sat 9 Oct 2021

Children with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection had significantly elevated levels of a trio of saliva cytokines, according to a preliminary analysis. In the pilot study with 180 children, those with severe COVID-19 had elevated levels of CXCL10, MIG, and TNF R-1 in their saliva vs children with mild COVID-19, reported Usha Sethuraman, MD, of Central Michigan University in Mount Pleasant, at the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) virtual meeting.

While specific cytokine profiles could not be related to various symptoms of COVID-19 infection -- partly due to small sample size -- the researchers hope additional data will enable them to differentiate the biomarkers of pediatric COVID-19 patients, she noted.

"A lot of these children who have COVID have very similar symptoms to those with other common viral infections," Sethuraman told MedPage Today. "And there is no way for us to tell which child is going to get sicker or not. So, if we have a method to determine which child is going to develop [multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C)] or severe COVID, that would help us start treatment earlier."

"So, in that sense, this would be a game changer," she added.

COVID-19 cases in children are generally mild, but some younger patients can present with MIS-C, Kawasaki disease, or respiratory failure. In the 24 states and New York City that report on child hospitalizations, children are hospitalized in 0.1%-1.9% of all pediatric COVID-19 cases, according to September 2021 AAP data.

Currently, there are no established biomarkers that can predict the progression and severity of COVID-19 in children, although studies have linked disease severity with enhanced cytokine levels in adults. Sethuraman said her group chose saliva cytokines because of the ease of sampling. "The primary purpose of this study was to make it as noninvasive as possible," she said.

The study started in March 2021 and will go until June 2022. Initial data from March until May [2021] came from the Children's Hospital of Michigan in Detroit and UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. The analysis of saliva samples is being done at the Penn State College of Medicine in Hershey, Pennsylvania, while model development using artificial intelligence (AI) is being done at Wayne State University in Detroit.

Of the 180 children (mean age 7.1 years; 49.9% female) enrolled in the study thus far, 60 were hospitalized and 40 were categorized as having severe COVID-19. Of those 40, 5 exhibited cardiac symptoms, 26 had severe respiratory symptoms, while the others exhibited neither, but "were mostly diagnosed with MIS-C," according to Sethuraman.

Six salivary cytokines -- TNF R-1, IL-13, IL-15, CCL7, CXCL10, and MIG (CXCL9) -- were measured, and all 3 of the elevated cytokines in patients with severe disease were pro-inflammatory, the researchers reported. They also found that cytokines did not vary significantly (P greater than 0.05) between various COVID-19 phenotypes, and that a hierarchical logistic regression showed that a 3-cytokine-based model accounted for "only 4.2% of the variance between severe and non-severe COVID groups."

"The combined model of the 3 cytokines with age, gender and asthma status showed moderate accuracy (75%) and poor sensitivity (21%)," the researchers stated, and that was a study limitation, along with the small number of patients.

Sethuraman and colleagues also measured miRNA levels in 129 saliva samples. They found that levels of 63 miRNAs differed significantly between severe and nonsevere cases in their initial analysis and showed promise as a predictive model.

"Our ultimate goal is to incorporate all features, including social determinants of health and clinical information, and use AI to make a model," Sethuraman said. "[We want] to narrow down to a few miRNA and some cytokines, and develop a bedside tool [that] spits out a prediction for us for whether a child has severe disease."

1. Covid-19 (332) - Peru: hospitalizations and deaths in unvaccinated individuals
Ministry of Health: More than 90% of deaths and hospitalizations due to COVID-19 were unvaccinated

2. Covid-19 (333) - UK: vaccinated, lower infectivity with the same viral load, study
Vaccinated people are not as contagious as unvaccinated people, even with the same viral load

People who are vaccinated against COVID-19 are less likely to spread the virus even if they become infected, a new study finds, adding to a growing body of evidence that vaccines can reduce transmission of the delta variant.

British scientists at the University of Oxford examined national records of nearly 150 000 contacts that were traced from roughly 100 000 initial cases. The samples included people who were fully or partially vaccinated with either the Pfizer-BioNTech or the AstraZeneca vaccines, as well as people who were unvaccinated. The researchers then looked at how the vaccines affected the spread of the virus if a person had a breakthrough infection with either the alpha variant or the highly contagious delta variant.

Both vaccines reduced transmission, although they were more effective against the alpha variant compared to the delta variant. When infected with the delta variant, a given contact was 65% less likely to test positive if the person from whom the exposure occurred was fully vaccinated with 2 doses of the Pfizer vaccine. With AstraZeneca, a given contact was 36% less likely to test positive if the person from whom the exposure occurred was fully vaccinated. The risk of transmission from a breakthrough infection was much higher if someone had received just one dose of either vaccine.

The study was posted online Thursday [30 Sep 2021] and hasn't yet been peer reviewed. But scientists not associated with the research said the findings were credible. "It's the highest quality study we have so far on the question of infectiousness of vaccinated people infected with delta," said Dr. Aaron Richterman, an infectious disease physician at the University of Pennsylvania, who was not involved in the research. Susan Butler-Wu, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Southern California, called the study "well performed," especially because it reflects real-world transmission since it tracked spread among close contacts.

Using cycle threshold (Ct) values, the researchers found a similar level of viral load in unvaccinated and vaccinated people who were infected with the delta variant, backing up prior studies. Even so, people who were fully vaccinated were still less likely to infect others. "Transmission is much more complex," Butler-Wu said, meaning the Ct value is just a snapshot in time and doesn't reflect the entire course of illness.

It's likely that people who have been vaccinated clear the infectious virus from the body faster. A previous study from Singapore had found that although levels of the virus were initially the same in those infected with the delta variant regardless of vaccine status, by day 7, levels of the virus dropped quickly in those who were vaccinated, which may reduce the ability to spread illness (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.28.21261295v1).

There is emerging evidence that even though cycle threshold values may be the same regardless of vaccination status, people who are vaccinated may have less infectious virus in their bodies, potentially reducing transmission. Richterman pointed to a recent pre-print from China that found a large reduction in transmission in those who had received 2 doses of vaccine, compared to the unvaccinated (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.12.21261991v1).

Vaccines have the ability to prevent transmission of the virus in 2 ways, he said. The 1st is by preventing infection altogether. The other is by reducing the amount of infectious virus should somebody get sick. "People who have been vaccinated will have immune systems at the ready that can coat the virus in antibodies much more quickly than unvaccinated people who have to build up an immune response," Richterman said.

The new study showed that protection against transmission seemed to wane over time, however. After 3 months, people who had breakthrough infections after being vaccinated with AstraZeneca were just as likely to spread the delta variant as the unvaccinated. While protection against transmission decreased in people who had received the Pfizer vaccine, there was still a benefit when compared with people who were unvaccinated.

Since antibody levels also tend to decrease over time after vaccination, a reduction in protection against transmission is to be expected, Richterman said. "We know that the amount of antibodies circulating in the blood decreases over time after vaccination, even though the immune memory remains durably robust and is still able to prevent infections, particularly severe infection," he said. "These circulating antibodies that are immediately available probably play some role in preventing transmission if infected, so I don't think it's surprising to see some reduced protection against transmission over time."

Richterman and Butler-Wu agreed that while community transmission remains high, masks and testing remain important. "We need to combine our vaccines with other measures to reduce how much virus we get exposed to, by things like masking and testing," Butler-Wu said. "Additive measures is the name of the game here."

Richterman agreed. "While there may be a level of vaccination coverage high enough where other interventions like masking and distancing aren't needed, we certainly aren't there yet in many parts of the USA," he said.
