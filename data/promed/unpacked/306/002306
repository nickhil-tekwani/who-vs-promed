"West Nile fever" refers to typically less severe cases that show no
evidence of neuroinvasion. West Nile fever is not currently on the
list of nationally notifiable diseases, and, therefore, it is
optional whether or not state health departments report these cases
to CDC. [Further explanations of neuroinvasive West Nile virus
disease and West Nile fever can be found on the CDC website at the

"Other" includes persons with clinical manifestations other than WN
fever, WN encephalitis, or WN meningitis, such as acute flaccid paralysis.
"Unspecified" cases are those for which sufficient clinical
information was not provided.
"Total human cases reported to CDC: "these numbers reflect both mild
and severe human disease cases occurring since 1 Jan 2007, reported
to ArboNET by state and local health departments. ArboNET is the
national electronic surveillance system established by CDC to assist
states in tracking West Nile virus and other mosquito-borne viruses.
Information regarding 2007 virus/disease activity is posted when such

North Dakota, Oregon, Puerto Rico, and Utah. [Note: not all states
have WNV sentinel programs. - Mods.JW/TY]

[5] USA: additional report (Montana)
Date: Sat 29 Sep 2007
Source: Montana State University via Huliq.com [edited]
<http://www.huliq.com/36192/new-suspect-in-west-nile-deaths-of-pelicans>

Stable flies [_Stomoxys calcitrans_] are the latest suspect that may
be involved in the West Nile virus deaths of hundreds of pelican
chicks at the Medicine Lake National Wildlife Refuge in northeast
Montana. West Nile virus killed 800 to 1000 pelican chicks in 2003,
averaged 400 in each of the next 3 summers, and more than 600 this year [2007].
Veterinary entomologist Greg Johnson of Montana State University said
earlier this year [2007] that he considered the possibility that lice
were transmitting West Nile virus to pelicans. He became suspicious
after collecting very few mosquitoes in 2006, but seeing pelicans
continue to die at a high rate. Johnson discovered previously that
the _Culex tarsalis_ mosquito is the primary carrier of West Nile
virus in Montana and that the Medicine Lake refuge was one of the hot
spots for the virus.
Many of the dead pelicans [_Pelicanus erythrorhynchus_] at Medicine
Lake had lice [_Piagetiella peralis_] crawling inside and outside of
their beak, Johnson continued. Mike Rabenberg, deputy refuge manager,
said external parasites -- especially pouch lice and feather lice --
are common on the Medicine Lake pelicans. The lice may be more
prevalent, he said, on pelicans that are sick or weakened.
The lice were cleared, however, after Johnson sent pelican tissue
samples and lice to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Fort Collins, Colorado. The lab tested approximately 800 lice, but
none was found to have West Nile even though most came from pelicans
that tested positive.
Stable flies caught Johnson's attention when he came across a bird
with blood on its neck and some flies feeding on the blood during the
third week of July [2007'. Stable flies look like common houseflies,
but they have a painful bite. They come from a different family than
horse flies or deer flies, however.
"This (the stable fly scene) was very unusual because stable flies
are only reported to feed on domestic livestock, humans and companion
animals," Johnson said. "There are no reports in the literature of
stable flies feeding on domestic or wild birds."
Johnson observed the stable flies feeding on birds several more
times. He also collected about 1300 flies and divided them into 60
groups. Of those groups, 18 tested positive for West Nile virus.
"This is the 1st report of stable flies feeding on wild birds, or
pelicans for that matter, and the 1st report of stable flies infected
with West Nile virus," Johnson said. "These results suggest that
stable flies might be involved in amplification and/or transmission
of West Nile virus at the pelican colony and possibly could serve as
a vector of West Nile virus to other pelicans."
If the theory proves correct, he will have to modify some of his
study methods because they currently focus on mosquitoes, Johnson
said. He added that the number of captured mosquitoes was high this
summer [2007], as well as the West Nile infection rate in those mosquitoes.
As far as the relationship among lice, pelicans, and West Nile virus
goes, Johnson said the lice created wounds that could be a point of
entry for the virus, however they don't pass along the virus.
"I don't think they are playing a primary role in West Nile
transmission because they don't have to have blood for egg
development, energy, and survival," Johnson said. "Rather, they feed
on epidermal or skin cells which creates wounds, causing blood to
exude and then they feed on the blood. The wounds they cause may
provide entry sites for West Nile virus, and the young pelicans can
get infected that way."
The Medicine Lake National Wildlife Refuge between Plentywood and
Culbertson contains the 5th largest colony of American white pelicans
in North America. Rabenberg said the colony normally includes 8000 to
10 000 breeding adults and approximately 4000 nests. The adult
pelicans fly up to 150 miles (241 km) one way a day looking for food.
The Medicine Lake adults fly to other mosquito-rich areas like Terry,
the Fort Peck Reservoir, and the Yellowstone River. They fly into
Saskatchewan and North Dakota. The adult pelicans typically winter
along the Gulf coast, but some reach southern Mexico.

[This interesting report adds a new biting arthropod to the list of
suspected West Nile virus (WNV) vectors and Dr. Johnson is to be
congratulated for making this unusual observation. However, this
report does not prove that stable flies are vectors of the virus.
Isolation of the virus alone is not sufficient to establish vector
status. It is possible that stable flies are mechanical vectors --
transmitting the virus via virus-contaminated mouth parts. Laboratory
experiments would be required to establish (or refute) biological
vector status, demonstrating the virus replicates in the files
following ingestion of viremic blood and reaches salivary glands for
subsequent transmission to a susceptible vertebrate host.
It is also possible that the detection of WNV simply represents
external contamination of the flies' bodies by viremic blood, and
they do not transmit the virus at all. While it is clear that the
stable flies had WNV in or on their bodies, the statement in the
report above that the flies were infected with WNV is premature. One
hopes that this report will stimulate experiments that will test for
biological or mechanical vector capacity of this common biting fly. - Mod.TY
