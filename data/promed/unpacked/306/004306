Influenza type D could play a role in the bovine respiratory disease complex. The Influenza D virus (IDV) was 1st isolated from pigs in 2011 at the University of Minnesota. But while IDV can circulate in pigs, it generally affects cattle rather than pigs, says Ben Hause, PhD. Hause, who served on the team 1st identifying IDV, has studied the virus as a graduate student at South Dakota State University and as a faculty member at Kansas State University. He now serves as vice president of research, development and diagnostics at Cambridge Technologies.

Hause presented information on IDV during the recent Academy of Veterinary Consultants (AVC) spring conference in Fort Worth, Texas.

The influenza D virus is distantly related to influenza C, Hause says, but it represents a new genus and does not cross-react with antiserum for influenza types A, B or C. Since its discovery, researchers have found that IDV is widespread and fairly common in cattle and could play a role in the bovine respiratory disease (BRD) complex.

Researchers using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening of samples from 40 Nebraska farms found 98 percent of calves positive for IDV, Hause says. In a Mississippi test, researchers found IDV in 29 percent of calves showing clinical signs of BRD, and just 2 percent of healthy calves, suggesting the virus could play a role in BRD.

Scientists have developed an IDV vaccine, and Kansas State University researchers conducted a challenge study with 65 6-month-old calves previously determined to be seronegative for IDV. They split the calves into 3 groups. One group received the vaccine and viral challenge, another received the vaccine and no viral challenge and the 3rd group received no vaccine and no viral challenge. In that trial, IDV titers were lowest in the group with vaccine and no challenge, intermediate in the group with vaccine and challenge and highest in the group with the viral challenge and no vaccine.

Researchers also noted that IDV, by itself, is associated with mild respiratory disease. Hause notes clinical cases of BRD typically involve more than one pathogen, including several viruses and bacteria. How much of a role IDV plays when combined with other BRD viruses and bacteria remains unclear.

Hause summarized with these key points:
- IDV is widespread in cattle worldwide.
- Bovines serve as primary reservoirs for the virus.
- IDV alone causes mild BRD.
- IDV likely is a significant part of the BRD complex.
- An inactivated IDV vaccine can offer some protection.

[While Dr. Hause acknowledges he is uncertain of the roll IVD plays in BVD, he did not elaborate if the vaccine (apparently under development) had any positive role in reducing clinical signs of BVD or improved outcomes when used in the face of BVD infections.

What Dr. Hause does not tell us is where they are in the process of having this trial vaccine proceed through the regulatory process to make this vaccine commercially available. I suspect this vaccine has some ways to go before being commercially available.
