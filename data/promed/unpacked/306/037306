SEOUL, Nov 6 - A seven-year-old South Korean boy has contracted
the country's first case of the potentially deadly O157 bacterium
which killed several people in neighbouring Japan, reports said
Friday.
The Seoul youngster was found to be carrying the virulent strain of
the _E.coli_ bacterium which is generally found in meat and causes
severe food poisoning, sometimes leading to death.
Health ministry official told the Korea Herald daily that the boy was
hospitalised last month to be treated for severe vomiting, a high
fever and stomach aches.
Tests revealed he was suffering from O157 food poisoning, prompting
the ministry to scramble experts to his kindergarten to search for
signs of the bacteria at the school or among the boy's friends.
Officials are also moving to prevent any outbreak of food poisoning
after one strain of the O157 bacterium was detected in some beef
imports from the United States.
An O157 outbreak in Japan in 1996 killed at least seven people and
left hundreds of children seriously ill causing panic across the
country.
The bacteria can be caught from eating undercooked, contaminated
meat, and beef has frequently proved to be a favourite breeding
ground for the germ.
[EHEC = entero-hemorrhagic _E.coli_. We are using the term in our
titles because there is confusion in the press about whether the name
is O157 with a capital "O", or 0157 beginning with zero. The first
is correct, but if we don't get it right in our titles, our
alphabetic TOPICS index gets messed up - Mod.JW
