North Louisiana Woman Dies from Rare Ameba Infection
-------------------------------------------------------
The Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals is warning residents
about the dangers of the improper use of neti pots. The warning
follows the state's 2nd death this year caused by _Naegleria fowleri_,
the so-called brain-eating ameba.

A 51-year-old DeSoto Parish woman died recently after using tap water
in a neti pot to irrigate her sinuses and becoming infected with the
deadly ameba. In June [2011], a 20-year-old St. Bernard Parish man
died under the same circumstances. _Naegleria fowleri_ infects people
by entering the body through the nose. A neti pot is commonly used to
irrigate sinuses, and looks like a genie's lamp.

"If you are irrigating, flushing, or rinsing your sinuses, for
example, by using a neti pot, use distilled, sterile or previously
boiled water to make up the irrigation solution," said Louisiana State
Epidemiologist, Dr. Raoult Ratard. "Tap water is safe for drinking,
but not for irrigating your nose." It's also important to rinse the
irrigation device after each use and leave open to air dry.

_Naegleria fowleri_ infection typically occurs when people go swimming
or diving in warm freshwater lakes and rivers. In very rare instances,
_Naegleria fowleri_ infections may also occur when contaminated water
from other sources (such as inadequately chlorinated swimming pool
water or heated tap water less than 116.6 degrees Fahrenheit) enters
the nose when people submerge their heads or when people irrigate
their sinuses with devices such as a neti pot. You cannot be infected
with _Naegleria fowleri_ by drinking water.

_Naegleria fowleri_ causes the disease primary amebic
meningoencephalitis (PAM), a brain infection that leads to the
destruction of brain tissue. In its early stages, symptoms of PAM may
be similar to symptoms of bacterial meningitis.

Initial symptoms of PAM start one to 7 days after infection. The
initial symptoms include headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, and stiff
neck. Later symptoms include confusion, lack of attention to people
and surroundings, loss of balance, seizures, and hallucinations. After
the start of symptoms, the disease progresses rapidly and usually
causes death within one to 12 days.

_Naegleria fowleri_ infections are very rare. In the 10 years from
2001 to 2010, 32 infections were reported in the U.S. Of those cases,
30 people were infected by contaminated recreational water and 2
people were infected by water from a geothermal drinking water
supply.

[Meningoencephalitis caused by free living ameba. like _Naegleria
fowleri_. has a very high mortality. Flushing the sinus has been
reported to cause amoebic meningoencephalitis.
