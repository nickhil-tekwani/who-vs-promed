The cholera epidemic has produced 8 deaths among 27 cases reported in the locality of Banfele, located in the prefecture of Kouroussa in Upper Guinea, it was learned from sources close to the Department of Health. The epidemic was declared in this area on 3 Aug 2013 and has caused the mobilization of health services, which have deployed a logistics team to halt the spread of the disease.

Solutions have been distributed to the populations of Banfele, and latrines and other wells used by the inhabitants have been disinfected. In addition to these 8 deaths, there have been 10 more caused by cholera in Low Guinea and in Middle Guinea, in the prefecture of Mamou, among the 150 cases reported in these 2 regions since the month of January 2013.

The Ministry of Health and Public Hygiene has, among other measures to counteract this epidemic, conducted awareness campaigns in areas which have experienced cases of cholera.

[2] Cholera - Congo DR (South Kivu)

19 cases of cholera have been registered in a week in the locality of Kasunyu in the territory of Minova (South Kivu). This information was delivered on Tue 20 Aug 2013 by the chief physician of the area of Minova, Dr. Chito-ryu Bagula, who attributes the resurgence of this disease to the consumption of water from Lake Kivu and the absence of public latrines. He called on the inhabitants of Kasunyu to observe sanitary practices to avoid a greater spread of the disease.

Approximately 15 000 inhabitants of the locality of Kasunyu use water from Lake Kivu for consumption and other domestic needs. "The only existing wells may not be sufficient for the entire population of this locality," stated Dr. Chito-ryu Bagula. The leader of the locality of Kasunyu, Safari Murebua, said that the swampy terrain does allow the building of latrines.

[4] Cholera - Guinea-Bissau, Niger, Senegal

The West African country of Guinea-Bissau has reported 700 cases of cholera thus far in 2013, making it the country in the region with the most cases, according to an IRIN (the humanitarian news and analysis service of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs) report.

Guinea-Bissau's poorest region, southern Tombali, is the worst hit, with 225 cases and 21 deaths as of late July [2013], said Nicolau Almeida, a health ministry director.

The UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) reported last month [July 2013] that there have been 742 cases in Guinea-Bissau, 416 in Niger and 368 in Sierra Leone. The outbreak in Guinea-Bissau is a continuation of the 2012 epidemic, when 3359 people contracted cholera.

"To confirm a new epidemic, the 2012 outbreak should have been declared over" by demonstrating the absence of _Vibrio cholerae_ in diarrhea [cases], said Inacio Alvarenga, an epidemiologist with WHO.

"For reasons I'm not aware of, the government did not test cases in the 1st weeks of the year [2013]. These cases did not disappear but got spread around," he continued. "I don't think we will hit the 2008 level [when 14 204 people were infected and 225 killed], but the disease risks will be lingering for several months like in 1996-1998."

IRIN does point out that the numbers so far this year [2013] in Guinea-Bissau are down from 2012 levels.

Two people have died, while 320 others have fallen ill since Mon 12 Aug 2013, following a cholera outbreak in Kurram Agency.

Assistant Political Agent Fazal Naeem told The Express Tribune central parts of the agency were the most affected. He added that 250 tribesmen have been shifted to Sadda Headquarters of Lower Kurram in addition to Hangu.

Naeem said Dhand and Kudiad Khel were the worst-hit areas and that vaccinations began amid tight security. He claimed nearly all the locals have been vaccinated, adding tribesmen were instructed not to drink water directly from the well and boil it first instead.

Meanwhile, political administration official from Parachinar Naseem Khan said around 100 people have been shifted to Parachinar Headquarters Hospital, adding that critical patients were admitted, while the others were discharged after medical aid.
