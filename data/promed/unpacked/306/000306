Australian vaccines have been implicated [as having been manufactured with
British calf serum - Man. Ed. DS] in the mad cow disease (BSE, Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy) after government investigators found last week
polio vaccines used in Australia could be traced to British cattle.
Nevertheless, Australia's Chief Medical Officer, Professor Richard
Smallwood, announced that despite the discovery, the vaccines would not be
withdrawn. He said the risk of infection with the lethal brain disease, new
variant or variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (nvCJD or vCJD), through an
infected dose of polio vaccine was "one in a million."
But the discovery of Australian vaccines being traced to British cattle
more than 10 years after the BSE threat was revealed, has prompted a new
audit of the source of all vaccines in Australia.
Professor Smallwood said the maker in Australia of the oral polio vaccine,
SmithKline Beecham, had only found out last week British calf serum
originally sourced from British cattle was used in the manufacture of the
Australian product.
A spokesman for SmithKline Beecham declined to explain how the company had
missed the British link for so long. The British had withdrawn a polio
vaccine brand 2 weeks ago because of links with the cattle, and is now
using the same vaccine as used in Australia.
Prof Smallwood said even though calf-serum was sometimes used in the early
stages of viral growth, the manufacturing process "literally washes away
the bovine material" so the final vaccine could contain "a minute trace of
the calf serum, if at all."
