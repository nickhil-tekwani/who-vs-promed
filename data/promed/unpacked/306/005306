The 1st confirmation of Schmallenberg virus [SBV] in Rhineland-Palatinate
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
According to the Ministry of Environment SBV has been confirmed in the fetus of a bison and its dam from the northern Rhineland-Palatinate area, the country's 1st confirmed evidence of the so-called Schmallenberg virus.

A total of 5 lambs are under investigation as the virus is suspected. The preliminary positive findings by the State Health Office were sent for confirmation to the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute on the Island of Riems. "Final results are expected by the end of the week," said Minister Ulrike Hofken.

Harmless to humans, the pathogen causes abortions in sheep, cattle and goats as well as abnormalities in lambs and calves. The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes [in fact, midges are regarded the predominant vector. - Mod.AS]. "We will monitor the situation very closely and implement the necessary measures cooperatively with the State Veterinary Laboratory and the District Veterinary authorities."

There is no vaccine as yet. The federal government intends to introduce mandatory reporting of this disease, to monitor the spread of infection. The Ministry of Environment of Rhineland-Palatinate will implement mandatory reporting for the Land shortly.

SBV, named after the location of the 1st detection in the Sauerland region, has been circulating for several weeks in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany [In fact, the actual circulation of the virus had taken place months ago; the current "circulation" is a manifestation resulting from a past infection. - Mod.AS]. It was previously confirmed in 52 herds in North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony, Hessen and Schleswig-Holstein. New suspected cases are now reported daily.

Schmallenberg-Virus: Probably, we haven't seen the worst yet
------------------------------------------------------------
The number of farms affected by SBV is increasing every day. But, according to Dr Martin Beer of the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute, Riems Island, this is only the tip of the iceberg.

So far, cases in the Netherlands, Belgium and North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony and Hessen have been confirmed. But also Rhineland-Palatinate will probably not escape the virus that has never been found in Europe before, Dr. Beer concluded at a recent vet congress in Leipzig. Sheep farms are particularly affected. It is assumed that the infection has occurred in pregnant animals during the summer/fall of 2011. The birth of infected calves is therefore probably to be expected.

Dr. Martin Ganter of the Clinic of Small Ruminants, Hannover Veterinary School, thinks it is striking that the distribution area of SBV is similar to that of bluetongue disease. Possible explanation could be surface tectonics.

The virus is probably transmitted by biting midges and mosquitoes and infects the fetus in pregnant animals relatively quickly, causing a high rate of malformed, weak live animals and birth defects. The virus is primarily detected in the brains of infected animals. It gives rise to dramatic changes in the brain, to the extent that parts of the brain can be missing. Infection in adult animals leads to declining milk production and high fever.

Dr Ganter thinks that infection with SBV will be made notifiable soon; deliberations with the EU are ongoing.

On 24 Jan 2012, the CVO (chief veterinarian officer) of the United Kingdom submitted to the OIE an official notification on the occurrence of an emerging disease caused by the Schmallenberg virus; see, with map, at http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=11539. - Mod.AS.]
