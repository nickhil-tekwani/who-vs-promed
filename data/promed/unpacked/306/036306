Government says polio cases found in Aceh and Riau
-----------------------------------------------
The government has reported the discovery of polio cases in Riau and
tsunami-ravaged Aceh as it prepares to embark on a 3rd vaccination
drive next month [November 2005] to fight the virus that has infected
269 children since it resurfaced in March [2005] after a decade-long absence.
Minister of Health Siti Fadilah Supari said on Tuesday [18 Oct 2005]
that a 3-year-old Acehnese boy had been found to be suffering from
the disease, the 1st polio case since the recent outbreak to be
discovered in Aceh, which is still struggling to recover from the
devastating impact of the 26 Dec [2004] tsunami.
"He had not received all his vaccinations," she told a press
conference, adding that health services in Aceh had yet to return to
normal since the disaster.
Although the boy lives in a village in East Aceh District, which was
not affected by the disaster zone, health officials voiced concern
over a possible resurgence of polio in Aceh as tens of thousands of
people were still living in refugee camps.
Another case had also been found in Riau, an oil-rich province also
located on Sumatra Island, Siti said, but did not provide details.
Siti said that it was hoped that the 3rd round of the vaccination
drive would reach more children, as Indonesia had set a polio-free
target date of 2008.
The ministry's director general of disease control, I Nyoman Kandun,
said that the government had yet to decide whether the 3rd round of
the drive would cover under-fives nationwide or in certain high-risk
areas only. "We will make a detailed plan soon," he said.
Indonesia has staged 2 rounds of the polio vaccination drive so far,
the 1st in August 2005 and the 2nd in September 2005.
Siti said that the next round of the drive would likely be held on 27
Nov 2005. The cost of the drive is estimated at USD 12 million, more
than 60 percent of which will be covered by foreign assistance.
Around 97 percent of the 23.4 million children targeted in the 2nd
round of the drive in September [2005] had been vaccinated, the minister said.
In the 1st round of the campaign, the government reached
approximately 22.2 million children, or 95 percent of those targeted.
The government will pay special attention this time around to a
number of provinces, such as North Maluku, Papua and West Irian Jaya,
as the 1st 2 rounds had managed to reach less than 90 percent of the
targeted children in these areas, Siti said.
A 3rd-round vaccination drive has been recommended by the World
Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF).
"We are by no means at the end of this outbreak. While we have done a
good job ... there's still more work to be done," said David
Hipgrave, a UNICEF health official in Indonesia, as quoted by AFP.
The water-borne virus spread to 35 regencies in 10 of the country's
total of 32 provinces at a speed that has raised international
concern that the disease could spread to neighboring countries unless
the necessary measures are taken.
The latest outbreak is said to be genetically linked to the virus
circulating in Sudan, Saudi Arabia and Yemen. The authorities believe
that it was brought to Indonesia by migrant workers, pilgrims or travelers.
The virus attacks and withers children's limbs and can be deadly. The
WHO says 19 countries have been re-infected with polio in the last 2 years.

5 new poliovirus cases were confirmed today [19 Oct 2005] from Aceh
(NAD), South Sumatera, Lampung and Riau provinces. This brings the
total number of polio cases to 300 (including 31 type 1 VDPV [vaccine
derived poliovirus], under investigation, from Madura Island in East
Java province). A total of 10 provinces and 34 districts are
affected. [According to a table at the above link, the date of onset
of the most recent case reported as of 17 Oct 2005 was 7 Sep 2005;
information on the most recent date of onset, including the 5 new
cases, was not available. - Mod.MPP]

[The identification of these 2 most recent cases is yet another
setback for interruption of transmission of wild poliovirus in
Indonesia. These 2 provinces are geographically separated from
Lampung, the most southerly province on Sumatra Island, suggesting
significant spread of the wild poliovirus on the island of Sumatra.
See map of provinces at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/indonesia_adm_2002.jpg>.
While coverage during the last national vaccination day was reported
to be high (97 percent of the targeted population), there is always
the likelihood that there are persistent low coverage "pockets of
susceptibles" that are not reached during the campaigns.
The report from SEARO mentions 31 cases of type 1 VDPV infection
under investigation in Madura Island which is up from the 20 cases
reported in ProMED-mail posting Poliomyelitis - Indonesia (19):
RFI 20050930.2864. More information on this cluster would be
greatly appreciated. If true, this would be the 2nd largest cluster
of VDPV reported to date. Prior clusters of VDPV have involved
smaller numbers of cases - Madagascar - 4 cases, Philippines - 3
cases, Dominican Republic/Haiti - 21 cases and Egypt - 32 cases (see
refs below)
As for the global update on reported wild poliovirus cases as of 11
Oct 2005, there have been a total of 1349 cases reported, of which
489 were reported from Nigeria, 472 from Yemen, 264 from Indonesia,
37 from India, 26 from Sudan, 18 from Pakistan, 17 from Ethiopia, 8
from Angola, 4 from Afghanistan, 4 from Niger, 3 from Mali, 3 from
Somalia, one from Chad, one from Eritrea, one from Cameroon, and one
from Nepal. <http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp>. - Mod.MPP]
