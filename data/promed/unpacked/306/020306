UK guidelines on erythromycin chemoprophylaxis in persons exposed to
pertussis have been published recently.
Dodhia H, Crowcroft NS, Bramley JC, Miller E: UK guidelines for use of
erythromycin chemoprophylaxis in persons exposed to pertussis. J Pub Health
Med 2002;24:200-206
Abstract from:<http://pubmed.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/24/3/200>
Pertussis is well controlled in the UK as a result of an effective
vaccination program. Nevertheless, the disease has not been eliminated, and
cases still occur in the most vulnerable group of young infants.
Erythromycin chemoprophylaxis has been advocated for use in contacts to
prevent secondary cases, but the evidence for its use is weak. These
guidelines are based on a review of the evidence and aim to help clinicians
make more rational decisions on the use of erythromycin chemoprophylaxis
for pertussis. Erythromycin has well-established side effects, and so its
use should be limited to situations in which it is likely to be of greatest
benefit.
If a clinically suspected or confirmed case of pertussis is identified who
is also in household contact with someone at greatest risk from pertussis
-- young infants, especially neonates -- then erythromycin chemoprophylaxis
should be considered. The aim is to protect those at greatest risk from
pertussis by offering chemoprophylaxis to them, to all their household
contacts who are unimmunized, and to contacts who are 5 years or older if
they did not receive a preschool pertussis booster (not given to those born
before 1996 in the United Kingdom). There is no evidence of any benefit
from chemoprophylaxis given more than 21 days from the date of onset of the
primary case. Unimmunized or partially immunized cases and contacts should
complete their course of vaccine.
I thought this might be of interest to ProMED-mail Readers.

[These UK guidelines discuss in more detail the use of macrolide
chemoprophylaxis which, in the absence of a licensed pertussis vaccine in
adults, remains the basis of stemming a pertussis outbreak in the adult
population. - Mod.LL]
