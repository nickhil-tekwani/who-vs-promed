Ireland's 1st case of [human] botulism in over 20 years is being
treated in the Mayo General Hospital in Castlebar.
The Mayo News has learned that a Polish national is in the hospital's
intensive care unit recovering from the potentially fatal and
paralytic illness. A Health Services Executive spokeswoman declined,
however, to confirm the precise nature of the man's illness. She did
confirm that a Polish man, who was in a coma, is now in a stable
condition in the hospital. It is believed the man became ill after
eating a home-cooked meal sent by his wife from Poland.
It seems the rare occurrences of botulism meant that the hospital
pharmacy did not hold a supply of its antitoxin. Fortunately,
Westport's pharmaceutical company, Allergan, was in the unique
position of providing a solution to the life-threatening situation.
A Garda (Ireland's police force) spokesman confirmed that Westport
Garda Station was contacted on 9 Sep 2006 regarding a Polish man
living in the town who had been admitted to Mayo General Hospital the
previous day in a critical condition. "A doctor requested that we go
to the man's home and remove some food boxes from the fridge for
analysis in the hospital's laboratory," said the Garda spokesman.

[It is not reported what kind of food was ingested and how it was
stored during transportation from Poland to Ireland. As was noted
recently related to a cluster of botulism from commercial carrot
juice (ProMED post 20060916.2638), proper refrigeration and storage
after preparation is important.
ProMED thanks Brent Barrett for this submission.
