[According to press releases published by Ireland's Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on 10 Jan 2017 at http://agriculture.gov.ie/press/pressreleases/2017/january/title,104965,en.html: "The Department today [10 Jan 2017] announced that it has confirmed that the avian influenza subtype H5N8 detected in the wild bird found in County Wexford on 28 Dec 2017 is the highly pathogenic strain that has previously been confirmed in the UK and mainland Europe. This is the only case detected in Ireland so far.

As previously advised, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre has confirmed that the risk to humans is considered to be very low.

The Department continues to monitor the situation and notes the deteriorating weather forecast for continental Europe this week.

The Department reiterates once again the requirement to confine poultry and other birds and to apply strict bio-security measures to prevent the introduction of avian influenza. Poultry flock owners should remain vigilant for any signs of disease in their flocks and report any disease suspicion to their nearest Department Veterinary Office.
