Chytridiomycosis is an emerging disease responsible for a series of global
population declines and extinctions of amphibians. We report the causative
agent, _Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis_, in North American bullfrogs (_Rana
catesbeiana_) farmed for the international restaurant trade. Our findings
suggest that international trade may play a key role in the global
dissemination of this and other emerging infectious diseases in wildlife.
Cutaneous chytridiomycosis is an emerging fungal disease of amphibians
responsible for a series of mass die-offs, population declines, and
extinctions of amphibians on a global scale (1,2). In wild, susceptible
species, chytridiomycosis may be able to cause catastrophic population
loss, sometimes completely removing local populations (2).
This disease is a serious threat to the conservation of wild amphibians,
and policy measures to control amphibian movements have been established by
at least one authority (Parks and Wildlife Commission of the Northern
Territory, Australia; Bill Freeland, pers. comm.). Chytridiomycosis is
caused by a zoosporic fungus, _Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis_, which
develops solely within keratinized cells (3), causing extensive
hyperkeratosis and death by an-as-yet-unknown mechanism (1,4,5).
Chytridiomycosis is a key example of an emerging infectious disease in
wildlife (6,7). The most important factor driving the emergence of such
wildlife diseases is the anthropogenic introduction of pathogens into new
geographic areas (pathogen pollution) (6Â­9).
We report on _B. dendrobatidis_ in captive bullfrogs, which was identified
during an episode of unusually high death rates of unknown cause and which
implicates a relatively new food animal trade in the spread of this disease.
