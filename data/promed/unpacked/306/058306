The mysterious death of a Shetland pony in Los Angeles 3 months ago
may help solve the puzzle of how equine influenza reached Australia.

The 13-year-old mare was found dead in its stall on 20 Aug 2007 after
arriving on a cargo plane from Melbourne via Auckland, 3 days after
horses at the Eastern Creek Quarantine Station in Sydney showed signs
of horse flu and 5 days before the outbreak was made public.

Although there had been no contact with the sick imported horses,
which arrived on 7 Aug 2007, an Adelaide equine expert believes the
pony could have been infected by equipment or staff used by the
transport company which handled both deliveries.

The autopsy by the Californian Animal Health and Food Safety
Laboratory, obtained by the Herald, does not give a cause of death
but rules out a bacterial infection and poisoning. It also notes:
"Female pony submitted with a history of acute onset of disease while
in quarantine, characterized by high temperature, recumbency,
respiratory distress and death." [This statement is a fairly standard
accession statement to state the incoming characteristics of the
patient for a veterinary diagnostic laboratory. - Mod.TG]

Elizabeth Woolsey Herbert from the Adelaide Plains Equine Clinic,
which tested the pony for equine infectious anemia (EIA) before it
left, insists the death should be investigated by the commission of
inquiry headed by the retired High Court judge, Ian Callinan, which
resumes next week. [A test for EIA would NOT pick up equine
influenza. - Mod.TG]

Dr Woolsey Herbert, a Californian who has support among experts in
the United States, said horse flu was an obvious, although unusual
cause of death: "I felt obliged to report it. The raised temperature
and congested lungs are signs of EI. Given the circumstances of the
horse's death and the EI scenario, it is something that should be
considered and at least investigated. The laboratory had kept tissue
samples of the horse, which should be tested for signs of a virus.
The death seems very quick, but there are few other explanations,
given there was no bacterial infection or poisoning and the only
significant finding pointed to a respiratory problem. The horse had a
fever, and the stress of being transported and not being vaccinated
may have exacerbated its reaction."

The company that transported the pony, International Racing
Transport, brought thoroughbred stallions into Australia from
Ireland, one of the 2 countries being investigated by the inquiry as
being the source of the [EI] outbreak that shut down the racing
industry in NSW and Queensland.

The sire Encosta de Lago, which had been imported from the Coolmore
Stud, was the 1st to contract the disease in quarantine. It then
spread from Eastern Creek, possibly by human contact.

The chief executive of International Racing Transport, Quentin
Wallace, dismissed Dr Woolsey Herbert's concerns but conceded it was
possible stable hands or equipment used to transport the Irish horses
could also have been used out of Melbourne a week or so later. He
confirmed the necropsy on the pony said the cause of death was not
apparent and said it was one of the most unusual deaths he'd seen.

"It would be drawing a hideously long bow to suggest that this
horse's death had anything to do with the outbreak of EI in
Australia," he said, adding it would be a "red herring" for the
commission to investigate the death.

Mr Wallace said the aircraft carrying the pony had not been in Sydney
but conceded the same stable hands or stalls could have been used in
both places: "Airline equipment is used all over the world and then
gets cleaned. If that was the test, then no horse would be moved anywhere."

The chief executive of the Australian Racing Board, Andrew Harding,
said the inquiry should be given details about the death: "The
inquiry has shown it is determined to get to the bottom of this. I'd
feel confident that if this matter was brought to the attention of
the inquiry they would assess it and determine if it was worth investigating."

The inquiry has done 100 interviews and intends interviewing another
150 people. It is sorting through more than 30 000 documents to
uncover how the flu outbreak, which could cost taxpayers more than
USD 500 million in compensation to the thoroughbred industry alone, occurred.

[There are a couple of things that stand out in this article. 1st, a
test for equine infectious anemia (EIA) is not the same as a test for
equine influenza (EI). Air flights stress a human immune system.
Knowing that, I am baffled why an owner would ship an animal without
proper vaccinations and allowing for onset of immunity produced by
those vaccinations. There also seems to be some concern that EI can
be transmitted by fomites.

Equine influenza is spread via aerosolized respiratory secretions and
fomites, including contaminated inanimate objects and people moving
between infected and uninfected horses. The most common source of
infection and outbreak is the introduction of a new animal into the
herd. The incubation period is usually one to 3 days. Incubation
periods approaching 7 days have been observed but are less common.
Infected horses shed virus in their respiratory secretions during the
incubation period and continue to excrete the virus for 4 to 5 days
after clinical signs are observed. It is also possible for an
infected animal to shed the virus for 7-10 days after the animal has
appeared to recover. Viral shedding is thought to reach its peak
during the 1st 24 to 48 hours the animal is febrile. Infected
droplets may be able to spread as far as 50 yards. Virtually 100
percent of horses that are exposed become infected. Nearly 20 percent
of infected horses do not exhibit clinical signs of disease but still
shed virus and can spread the infection. (This paragraph extracted from:
