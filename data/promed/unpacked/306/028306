[The 2 articles below report the occurrence of Usutu virus infections in
humans, the 1st in Italy and in Europe. - Mod.TY]

August-September 2009. Euro Surveill 14:pii=19446.

Usutu virus (USUV) is an arthropod-borne virus of the family Flaviviridae,
genus Flavivirus. It is included in the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)
group being closely related to human pathogens such as JEV and West Nile
virus (WNV). In the last decade, USUV was detected in a variety of central
European birds with encephalitis, myocardial degeneration, and necrosis in
liver and spleen. As far as we know, the virus had never been associated
with severe or fatal disease in humans; it was isolated once in the Central
African Republic in a man with fever and rash. Here we report evidence of a
neuroinvasive infection clinically related to USUV in Italy.

We report the 1st worldwide case of Usutu virus (USUV) neuroinvasive
infection in a patient with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who presented
with fever and neurological symptoms and was diagnosed with
meningoencephalitits. The cerebrospinal fluid was positive for USUV, and
USUV was also demonstrated in serum and plasma samples by RT-PCR and
sequencing. Partial sequences of the premembrane and NS5 regions of the
viral genome were similar to the USUV Vienna and Budapest isolates.

Usutu virus infection in a patient who underwent orthotropic liver
transplantation, Italy, August-September 2009. Euro Surveill 14:pii=19448.

------------------------------------------------------------------
We report a case of Usutu virus (USUV)-related illness in a patient that
underwent an orthotropic liver transplant (OLT). Post transplant, the
patient developed clinical signs of a possible neuroinvasive disease with a
significant loss of cerebral functions. USUV was isolated in Vero E6 cells
from a plasma sample obtained immediately before the surgery, and USUV RNA
was demonstrated by RT-PCR and sequencing. This report enlarges the panel
of emerging mosquitoborne flavivirus-related disease in humans.

[Usutu virus was 1st isolated from _Culex neavei_ mosquitoes collected by
BM McIntosh in Ndumu, Natal, South Africa on 30 Jan 1959. Usutu virus may
be fairly widespread in central and western Europe. There is serological
evidence of Usutu infections in wild birds in the UK and an outbreak in
birds in a zoo in Vienna. Information extracted from Gideon database cited
in ProMED-mail archive 20031024.2665 states:

"Usutu virus (vectors: _Coquillettidia aurites_, _Culex neavei_, and _Culex
perfuscus_) has been identified in a single case of human infection (fever
with rash) in South Africa. The agent is named after the Usutu River in
Swaziland, and has been found in rodents (African soft-furred rats of
_Praomys_ species) and in birds (_Andropadus virens_, _Bycanistes sharpei_,
_Turdus libonyanus_) in South Africa, Cameroon, Mozambique, Nigeria,
Uganda, Senegal, and the Central African Republic.

In 2001, Usutu virus was confirmed as the cause of death among several wild
and captive birds in Austria: blackbirds, Great Gray Owls (_Strix
nebulosa_), and Barn Swallows (_Hirundo rustica_) in Upper Austria and the
Vienna Zoo."
