[Owners and caretakers should be using horse-specific fly/mosquito repellant. While this does not do a perfect job of keeping the blood sucking insects such as tabanid flies (horseflies) off the animals, it may help.

This is another wicked and unforgiving disease. Our sympathy to those affected. - Mod.TG
