What is to be remembered here is that we are not really dealing with an
infection at all, meaning a relationship between two living organisms - the
host and the infectious agent. In prion diseases only the diseased host is
living, not the prion. There is no evidence that any living infectious agent
such as a virus ("slow" or otherwise) is involved. The "agent", the prion,
is an abnormal protein. This means that its "multiplication" is not the
result of mitosis and cell division but of an abnormal production of an
abnormal protein. There is transmission of the protein. At least the
susceptibility for the abnormal production of the protein seems to be
regulated by heredity of the living host, not the prion. The actual
mechanism of why and how this production occurs and the pathophysiology of
the disease is still largely unknown.
The fact that a living infectious agent is not involved means that only
the host is bound by the needs of all living organisms - survival and
reproduction. The host does not need the abnormal protein to survive. It is
not even known if the host actually needs the normal protein. The protein,
not being a living organism, does not mutate "to survive". Therefore, there
is no reason for the epidemic to continue once the source of the prion has
been removed.
I therefore don't consider prion diseases to be infectious diseases at
all. They can be more accurately described as transmissible metabolic
diseases which are at least partially regulated by heredity.

[- I rightly stand corrected for my incorrect use of the word "infections"
though some might say that prions mimic infective agents in some ways. But
I needed to make the point succinctly that many a disease may be "invisible"
thanks to redefinition or diagnostic problems, whether scientific or
political, while the underlying pathological condition continues. It is
unfortunately not a rare problem, nor for that matter a modern one, nor
limited in geographic distribution. Most of us have seen it at one time or
another in our professional careers. Martin Hugh-Jones]
