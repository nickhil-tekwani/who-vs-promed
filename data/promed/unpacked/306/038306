Study: Cross-Contamination Explains Anthrax Deaths
------------------------------------------------------------------------
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As many as 5,000 letters may have been
cross-contaminated with spores from anthrax-laced letters sent in attacks
in the United States late last year, experts said on Monday. That
cross-contamination can explain the deaths of 2 women, they said in
releasing a mathematical model showing how spores from letters sent to news
organizations and U.S. senators last year may have transferred onto other
pieces of mail and infected the pair. "If there were ever another outbreak
this could help us more rapidly control it and maybe more quickly identify
where it is coming from," Dr. Martin Blaser, a professor of medicine and
microbiology at the New York University School of Medicine who helped write
the study.
The letters are believed to have infected at least 18 people and to have
killed 5 of them. Another 4 cases of suspected skin, or cutaneous, anthrax
infection have not been confirmed. More than 10,000 people including
postal workers and Capitol Hill staffers took antibiotics to prevent
infection in case they were exposed, and this step saved lives. The
greatest danger from the attacks was probably not to the people the letters
were
addressed to, but to postal workers who handled the mail and to people who
got cross-contaminated mail, Blaser said in a study published in the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Blaser and Glenn Webb, a professor of mathematics at Vanderbilt University
in Nashville, Tennessee, came up with the model after the letter attacks in
October. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has assumed
that mail cross-contamination was to blame for the deaths of the 2 women,
but Blaser, an adviser to former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani on
bioterrorism even before the attacks, said it was not clear at first. He
said he figured it out when the second woman died in November.
Blaser and Webb developed a mathematical model based on the number of
anthrax letters and how many "nodes" -- such as a mailbox or a sorting
center -- they passed through. "As the contaminated letters travel through
the nodes, there is a probability that they may transfer spores to other
letters, and thus proliferate the number of contaminated letters in
successive generations," they wrote. For instance, letters addressed to
U.S. senators contaminated a post office in New Jersey, affecting postal
workers there.
"In a less than one-minute period, 300 letters passed through the same
sorting machines as each of those two original contaminated letters. These
600 letters (and more) were most likely first-generation cross-contaminated
letters," they wrote. "One was found to have gone to a recipient in
Seymour, Connecticut, who lived about a mile from the 94-year-old woman in
Oxford, Connecticut who died of inhalational anthrax on November 21." She
was probably infected by a "second-generation" cross-contaminated letter,
they said.
"There was also an issue early on about how many spores did it take to
infect a person," Blaser said. "Our model presumes that there is no one
magic number." Noting the 2 women who died were elderly, Blaser said older
people in general have weaker immune systems and are probably more
susceptible to inhaled anthrax.
"The rapid and widespread usage of antibiotics among postal workers and
persons in the immediate environment if the received original letters
probably averted a substantial number of cases," they wrote. It may be
worth vaccinating postal workers, they added.
"If there were another outbreak and cases started turning up in different
localities, the model could be used to work backward to identify the groups
of people who need to receive antibiotics or vaccine," Blaser said.
Last March a team at the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health
in Baltimore did calculations that showed at least nine more cases of
inhaled anthrax infection would have occurred if people had not been given
antibiotics.

[Vaccinating mail workers is a logical precaution, whether done proactively
or retroactively following a new incident. The paper also raises the
question of model validation and which unsampled sorting
stations ("nodes") may have been contaminated. MHJ Mod]
