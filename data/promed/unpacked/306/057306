Dear Dr Blancou
Newcastle Disease on Mangrove Mountain in New South Wales
Further to my email report of 2 April and update advice reports of 6, 7, 13,
17 and 23 April 1999, I wish to provide the following additional
information.
Depopulation and decontamination of the thirty two farms within the
proclaimed Infected Zone on Mangrove Mountain is progressing. As of 5 May,
1,523,600 birds had been destroyed. The disease has now been confirmed on a
total of 7 farms, with a further farm within the Infected Zone deemed
suspect, due to an immunoperoxidase positive result. The sample was
collected as part of the implemented surveillance program. Further samples
are being tested on this farm, which is being depopulated.
Intensive surveillance is being maintained in both the Infected Zone and the
surrounding Surveillance Zone.
I shall keep you advised of further developments.
Kind regards

Date of Notification
2 April, 6 April, 7 April, 13 April, 17 April, 23 April, 6 May 1999
Name of Disease
Newcastle Disease
Nature of Diagnosis
Serological tests
* Clinical diagnosis
Isolation of a Newcastle Disease virus
* Immunohistology
* Gene sequence studies showing a virulent cleavage sequence in the
fusion (F) protein
* Death of chick embryos at 48-72 hours in primary isolation
* Chorio-allantoic membrane (CAM) antigen localisation test -
positive
* Determination of Intracerebral Pathogenicity Index (ICPI) - 1.6.
Date of initial detection
25 March 1999
Estimated Date of first infection
18 March 1999 (provisional)
Number of separate outbreaks
Seven confirmed farms and one suspect farm within a 5 kilometre
radius.

Geographical identification
33o 37' south, 151o 18' east, at Mangrove Mountain near Sydney, NSW.
Details concerning the outbreak
As a precautionary measure all domestic birds on a total of
thirty-two farms (including initial infected farm of 1 April 1999) and a
number of small, non-commercial enterprises in the proclaimed infected zone
will be stamped out
Comments concerning affected population
Farm 1
* This farm is a commercial pullet-rearing farm. The affected pullets
were approximately 10 weeks old
* Unexplained illness and mortalities occurred in one of three sheds
only
* No birds, poultry or products have been exported from this farm
* No poultry have been processed in an export abattoir.
Farms 2/3
* Commercial broiler rearing units
* Mortalities on these properties were normal until Monday 12 April
1999.
* Swabs were taken from a number of sick birds and sent to the central
New South Wales laboratory for investigation. Mortalities continued to
increase reaching a peak on 16 April 1999.
Farm 4
* A slight increase in mortality was detected 15 April 1999. About 20%
of birds in the affected shed showed nervous signs and pyrexia.
Farms 5, 6 and 7
* These were declared infected farms on 22 April, following laboratory
diagnosis from tissue samples from sick birds.
Remaining farms in the infected zone
* Predominantly broiler farms with a number of small non-commercial
enterprises.
Comments on the epidemiology
Farm 1
A number of sick birds were noticed to be coughing and sneezing on
25 March and there was a low number of mortalities and a small number of
birds showing nervous signs. The birds were treated with antibiotics for
three days with no response. A number of birds were submitted to the
veterinary laboratory on 29 March 1999. Subsequently, samples were sent to
the CSIRO-Australian Animal Health Laboratory at Geelong for further
examination.
Farms 2/3 and 4
These farms are located within 1km of Farm 1 and were detected as
part of the ongoing surveillance activities in the Mangrove Mountain
infected and surveillance zones.
Mangrove Mountain is a well-defined wedge-shaped area, about 18km
long by 10km wide, bounded on the east, south and west by deep ravines, and
on the north by National Park/State Forest. There is no evidence of
infection elsewhere in Australia.
Avirulent to low virulence strains of Newcastle disease virus have
been present in Australia since the late 1960's. These strains have caused
little to no production problems and no vaccines have been used to control
these naturally circulating strains of the virus. Extensive molecular
characterisation of these endemic strains has been undertaken over these
years, concentrating on the genes encoding the F and HN proteins.
Nucleotide sequencing of the F gene, and particularly the HN gene,
clearly demonstrated that the outbreak virus strains were closely related to
a known Australian strain of low virulence for chickens. This suggested
that the outbreak viruses were derived from this Australian strain of NDV,
rather than from an imported strain of the virus.
Control measures taken to date
* Farm1 has been stamped-out, first disinfection completed and remains
in quarantine pending further disinfection and placement of sentinel birds.
* Stamping-out is continuing on all 32 farms within the proclaimed
Infected Zone.
* An infected zone comprising the whole of Mangrove Mountain ridge has
been proclaimed
* A comprehensive surveillance program has been instituted within the
Infected Zone and surrounding Surveillance Zone and further control measures
applied to the movement of live birds and product from the Mangrove Mountain
area.
* As a precautionary measure depopulation of all thirty-two farms in
the infected zone has commenced, with priority being given to flocks showing
suspicious clinical signs.
