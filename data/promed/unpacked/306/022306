State officials discovered another outbreak of a deadly equine disease in a
federally managed herd of wild horses near Vernal, prompting a quarantine
of the entire herd for at least 2 months.
The U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the Utah Department of
Agriculture and Food announced of 205 wild horses rounded up last week, 31
adult Mustangs in the Bonanza Herd have tested positive for equine
infectious anemia (EIA). The viral infection affects only horses and there
is no cure.
As required by state law to prevent the spread of the disease, the 31
horses were removed from the herd and euthanized. Officials identified 3
foals in the Bonanza Herd from EIA-positive mothers. The foals will be
separated from the herd for further testing to determine if they are indeed
infected or merely carrying EIA antibodies from their mothers' milk.
The remaining 171 wild horses will be corralled for at least 60 days about
30 miles southeast of Vernal to undergo 2 more "Coggins" test [a blood
test, performed on about 7,000 Utah horses annually to check for EIA.
"We want to make sure we've found all the positives, so we're keeping the
herd quarantined in a secure facility with hay, water and shelter, until we
are convinced no other animals have the disease," said BLM spokesman Glenn
Foreman. "This disease is carried by biting insects and it wasn't long ago
it was 70F degrees and we had potential carriers still flying around."
Last weeks round-up of the Bonanza horses was done to determine if EIA had
been wiped out of the herd, which roams White River drainage on the East
Tavaputs Plateau near the eastern edge of the Uintah and Ouray Indian
Reservation.
Last year, the worst-ever outbreak of EIA in the western US was discovered
in the Bonanza Herd, triggering an emergency roundup of 295 horses by the
BLM, state and Ute Indian tribe. Eighty horses tested positive and all but
12 foals were euthanized. The foals were removed to a research facility in
Oklahoma, where they eventually tested negative and were adopted out to the
public.
State Veterinarian Mike Marshall said his staff would monitor the
quarantined horses to determine if any others test positive for the disease
sometimes known as "swamp fever." "We know capturing this many horses is a
difficult task, but we find comfort in knowing we have gathered all the ill
horses," he said. "I have visited the [quarantine site and the horses are
being well cared for. I am hopeful we will soon be able to issue this herd
a clean bill of health."
Last week wranglers managed to gather all but 2 of the Bonanza horses that
were captured in last year's roundup, and the BLM hired helicopters to fly
an intense reconnaissance over the desert looking for any strays.
"It was our intention to rid this wild horse herd of the disease," said BLM
Vernal Field Manager Dave Howell. "We knew we might have some additional
sick horses."
Horses in the chronic stage of EIA have high temperatures, appear dejected,
refuse feed, become anemic and sometimes are too weak to walk or stand. The
disease can kill a horse in a matter of days or hibernate nearly 20 years
before death occurs.
