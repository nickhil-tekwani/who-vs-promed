Migratory bird tested positive for H5N1 virus in Hong Kong
-----------------------------------------------
The Hong Kong Agriculture, Fisheries, and Conservation Department (AFCD)
confirmed on Wednesday [3 Nov 2004] that a dead Grey Heron, found in the
Lok Ma Chau area, tested positive for the H5N1 virus.
A government spokesman said: "The dead bird, which was first found by a
worker of the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line project within the restricted area of
Lok Ma Chau, was handed over to AFCD for diagnostic testing on 1 Nov 2004.
Swab and tissue samples from the bird were confirmed positive for H5N1
avian influenza virus today [Wed 3 Nov 2004]."
In response, the government has stepped up monitoring of bio-security
measures at chicken farms, inspection of poultry stalls in retail markets,
and surveillance of wild birds at recreational parks. The Center for Health
Protection (CHP) has also initiated its surveillance program for public
health monitoring.
"All poultry farms in the vicinity of where the dead bird was found,
totaling 37 [farms], have been inspected by AFCD staff. There was no
abnormal mortality, and the chickens showed no signs of avian influenza.
Farmers have been alerted to pay special attention to their bird-proofing
facilities and to strictly implement bio-security measures," the spokesman
said. "As a precautionary measure, the AFCD will step up its farm
inspection program and wild bird surveillance program at recreational parks
during the next few days. The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department
will also continue to closely monitor the situation at the retail markets."
The spokesman said the CHP was monitoring the health conditions of the 7
persons who had contact with the dead bird. "As the CHP has taken immediate
and prompt actions to initiate its surveillance program on public health,
and made all necessary arrangements for those in contact with the infected
dead bird, it is unlikely that the virus has been able to spread in the
community. Therefore, we believe that there is no immediate threat to
public health," he said.
Hong Kong's health departments urged the public to observe good personal
hygiene and to avoid contact with wild birds and live poultry.
Since 1998, Hong Kong has put in place a comprehensive surveillance program
which enables the relevant authorities to monitor human influenza activity
and detect the presence of avian influenza viruses in the environment.
Concerning human influenza surveillance, the CHP has initiated a program
that covers a network of clinics, hospitals, and laboratories in the public
and private sectors, thus enabling the Center to monitor the disease trend
and circulating influenza viruses.
Concerning avian influenza surveillance, a comprehensive surveillance
program, targeted at poultry at all levels from farms, import, wholesale
markets, and retail outlets, has been implemented.
At the farm level, all chickens available in the market must be vaccinated
against H5 avian influenza. Stringent bio-security measures, including the
requirement for all chicken farms to be bird-proof, have been imposed to
prevent the introduction of viruses by wild birds.
In 2003, the government extended the surveillance program to wild birds in
recreational parks to ensure timely detection of the presence of any avian
influenza viruses in the environment and the possible re-assortment of the
viruses. Under the surveillance program, more than 2000 samples have been
tested since January 2004.
The Grey Heron (_Ardea cinerea_) is an abundant winter visitor, but a
scarce summer visitor, in Hong Kong. It is not a resident species in Hong Kong.

A dead gray heron, found in Hong Kong near the mainland China border, was
found to have the H5N1 bird flu virus, the government said on Wednesday [3
Nov 2004].
"The gray heron tested positive for H5N1," a government spokesman told
Reuters, referring to the bird recently found dead in the Lok Ma Chau area
near the mainland China border.
"We have already inspected the chicken farms nearby, and we have found no
bird flu symptoms or abnormal deaths among those chickens," Deputy Director
of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Conservation S.P. Lau told a news conference.
Health experts fear that the virus, which has killed 12 people in Thailand
and 20 in Viet Nam this year [2004], could mutate into a form that could be
transmitted between humans. Hong Kong has been a major concern for health
experts, who are worried about a comeback of bird flu, because the
territory is a favorite resting place for migratory birds, a natural
reservoir of the virus during the winter months. China has reported bird
flu outbreaks among poultry this year [2004], and experts say the disease
may be carried by migrating birds.
On Tuesday [2 Nov 2004], the government said the heron was suspected to
have fallen victim to a virus belonging to the H5 bird flu family, which
includes the H5N1 variant but also strains not known to affect humans.
Millions of chickens have been slaughtered across Southeast Asia, as
governments battle to contain a virus that World Health Organization
officials fear could, if left unchecked, eventually mutate and trigger a
human flu pandemic.
The avian influenza virus was first seen in humans in 1997 in Hong Kong,
where it infected 18 people and killed 6.

[Migratory birds have long been known to be the source of avian influenza.
The surveillance program here, and the rapid response to the situation, are
all appropriate measures. These measures indicate that much pre-planning
had occurred prior to the event of finding an infected bird. - Mod.TG]
