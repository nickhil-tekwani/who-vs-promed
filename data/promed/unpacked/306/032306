The outbreak in Rio Grande do Sul, occurred in a downtown named Sao Joao do Polesine, I live there and I'm one victim. Some people started to vomit and to have watery diarrhea on [Sun 25 Jun 2017], at night, after a lunch with potatoes, salad (boiled potatoes and eggs), rice, and meat. Other people, including myself, started on [Mon 26 Jun 2017] morning, with the same symptoms. Plus the cited symptoms, we had colic, fever and headache, weakness and pain in all the body. There was a verbal report that some people returned to hospital with blood in the feces on the 4th day.

There are more people affected in Santa Maria, Porto Alegre and other cities beside Sao Joao do Polesine. I'm not sure if it is due to salmonellosis. People used to blame it due to the eggs used in the potato salad, but in this case eggs where cooked previously. It is likely some cross contamination.

Material was already collected and is being analyzed by a governmental laboratory (LACEN I guess).

Around a month ago [May 2017] there was another gastroenteritis outbreak in the town. Diarrhea, vomit and fever, it was not investigated but a physician blamed a bacterial infection.
