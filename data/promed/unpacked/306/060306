Absence of Lassa fever in Ghana - From a press release issued jointly by
Ministry of Health and the WHO Representative in Ghana:
On 25 September 1997, the Ministry of Health, Ghana was contacted by the
Ghanaian Embassy in Bonn, Germany regarding a man who allegedly died of
Lassa fever at Mainz main hospital. The deceased was identified by the
hospital authorities as a 37-year male who had apparently arrived in
Germany on a Ghana Airways flight. The Ministry of Health, Ghana assured
the Ghanaian Embassy that no case of Lassa fever had been reported in Ghana
and thus the patient could not have been infected in Ghana. The Ministry
of Health recommended that the origin of the patient be verified since his
name did not sound Ghanaian nor did his supposed arrival via Ghana Airways
mean that he had recently stayed in Ghana.
On 26 September the Mainz hospital authorities called a press conference
and announced that tests conducted at the Tropical Disease Institute at the
Bernhard Nocht Institute, Hamburg had dismissed Lassa fever as the cause of
death of the man. The press release was issued to assure Ghanaians and all
visitors to Ghana that Lassa fever has never been detected in Ghana. Ever
since the detection of the cases of Lassa fever in Nigeria, Ghanaian
clinicians have been particular about examining cases of fever with
haemorrhagic tendencies thoroughly. In addition the Noguchi Memorial
Institute for Medical Research at the University of Ghana has often been
called upon to support the national laboratory network in this work. The
Ministry of Health is confident that their disease surveillance system is
very active and should a case of Lassa fever or any other unusual disease
appear in the country it will be detected and contained.
