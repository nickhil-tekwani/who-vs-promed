Threat of Eastern equine encephalitis critical after horse dies in Belchertown
--------------------------
[Please see the original website for a photo of the 2 varieties of mosquitoes- Mod.TG] This photo shows 2 varieties of mosquitoes. _Culex pipiens_, left, is also known as the northern house mosquito, and _Aedes vexans_, right, is also called the floodwater mosquito.


A horse in Belchertown died [31 Aug 2012] of Eastern equine encephalitis, and health officials are warning area residents about taking precautions against mosquito bites

A confirmed case of mosquito-borne Eastern equine encephalitis here has local boards of health warning residents to take precaution against mosquito bites in the hours from dusk to dawn.

The threat of EEE is considered "critical" in Belchertown and "high" in the towns surrounding it, including Amherst, Granby, Pelham, New Salem, Palmer, South Hadley and Ware. The University of Massachusetts Amherst sent a broadcast email to the entire college community Friday afternoon warning of the EEE risk.

The Belchertown Board of Health is recommending that residents curtail outdoor activities from dusk to dawn, wear protective clothing and use mosquito repellent.

Dr. Catherine Brown, lead veterinarian for the state Department of Public Health, said Friday that state lab testing confirmed late Thursday [6 Sep 2012] that a Belchertown horse died from EEE. The animal died [31 Aug 2012] quickly after becoming ill, and rabies was suspected as the cause, she said. When rabies testing proved negative, further testing was done and EEE was discovered, Brown said in a telephone interview.

The Belchertown Board of Health was notified about 5:30 p.m. on Thursday [8 Sep 2012], according to Judy Metcalf, the town's health director.

Metcalf said she called Town Administrator Gary L. Brougham, members of the Select Board and school Superintendent Judith Houle and sent email messages to all town department heads. Houle activated the public schools' parent notification telephone system and students were given material about EEE to take home, she said.

Officials met Friday [7 Sep 2012] morning to plan emergency notification measures that will include activation of the town's emergency telephone notification system today, Metcalf said. The DPH is advising Belchertown officials to cancel or reschedule nighttime events while mosquitoes are still active, Metcalf said.

Of particular concern are normal school activities, such as sports events that typically are held near dusk, Metcalf said. Another concern is the Belchertown Fair, held on the common at the end of September that schedules nighttime events such as fireworks.

"We're all doing our best to rearrange events," she said. "There isn't any way to totally eliminate risk," Brown said, adding that precautions are the best way to handle the EEE threat.

"I'm not looking to create fear. I'm looking for awareness," she said.

"There is a very effective vaccine (for animals) against EEE." Brown said mosquitoes remain active until the 1st "hard frost," which kills them and ends the EEE threat. Metcalf said the Valley's 1st hard frost usually comes in October.

"Obviously, we don't know what the future holds. We aren't in charge of the weather," she said.

Until then, Belchertown and health officials in surrounding communities will continue to monitor the situation and see if more EEE cases are reported, she said.

The Belchertown health board has posted several notices on the town's website, http://www.belchertown.org, detailing precautions residents should take when outdoors, how the disease is spread and what symptoms EEE causes. "So far in Granby, there have been no cases," said Michael Pandora, chairman of the Board of Health. "It's nothing we are overly concerned about. The advisory is to take standard precautions."

Pandora said this year's mild winter produced a bumper crop of mosquitoes. "We didn't have a cold winter, so not of lot of them got killed off," he said.

Besides wearing protective clothing, avoiding nighttime activities and using mosquito repellent, Pandora said Valley residents should pay attention after every insect bite for influenza-like symptoms that could indicate EEE. "Everybody needs to be really, really aware of body aches and flu-like symptoms," he said. "That's not a normal reaction to a mosquito bite."

[Once a horse has Eastern equine encephalitis they generally do not recover. If they do not die, they are often euthanized because of their poor condition and poor prognosis. The vaccine is very effective in preventing the disease. However, the protection against this disease wanes quickly. In areas that frequently have the disease, it is recommended to vaccinate every 4 months and certainly every 6 months.

Horses cannot pass this disease to people. It only is acquired from the bite of an infected mosquito.

Precautions to prevent the disease in people is as important as preventing the disease in horses. There is no vaccine for people. However, there are mosquito repellents available for horses and humans and should be used according to label directions.

Wearing long sleeves, long pants and light colored clothing is helpful in discouraging the mosquitoes. In the event of outdoor activities, wearing proper clothing and using mosquito repellent is a must. Otherwise avoid dusk and dawn when the mosquitoes are most active.

Mosquito repellent with DEET is the most appropriate repellent for humans.

[The warnings of the Health Department are prudent and should be heeded by local residents. Human EEEV infections can be serious, leading to fatalities or significant neurological damage in those who survive the encephalitis. There have been 2 human cases in Massachusetts already this summer (August, 2012), one of which was fatal. - Mod. TY]
