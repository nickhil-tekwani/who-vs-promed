A global risk assessment conducted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Organisation for Animal health (OIE), and WHO has shown that the overall risk of introduction and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the virus that causes COVID-19, from the fur-farming system to humans and to susceptible wildlife populations in the WHO European Region is considered high.

The global tripartite conducted the risk assessment in light of the Region's high number of fur farms, the wide variety of susceptible animal species used in fur farming, and the high number of overall cases of COVID-19 reported among the human population.

It is well documented that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can transmit between humans and animals. In April 2020, the Netherlands was the 1st country to report SARS-CoV-2 in farmed minks. Since then, another 9 countries -- 7 of which are in the European Region -- have reported similar findings. The European Region includes the largest number of fur-producing countries of all WHO regions.

In November 2020, Denmark reported the detection of a mink-associated SARS-CoV-2 variant with a combination of mutations not previously observed (referred to as Cluster 5). Preliminary findings suggested a lower capability of antibodies to neutralize the strain, and isolates of the variant strain were shared with selected WHO reference laboratories.

Following these findings, WHO, in collaboration with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), conducted a series of meetings with mink-fur-producing countries as well as a survey about SARS-CoV-2 in mink farms in the European Region.

These efforts aimed to get an overview of the fur-farming industry in Europe, gather information about measures applied by countries to prevent and reduce virus transmission between humans and animals, and inform the development of the One Health risk assessment on SARS-CoV-2 in farmed fur animals.

A total of 31 of the Region's 53 Member States responded to the survey. Of these, 15 reported that they have a fur industry. The fur industry is dominated by minks, while chinchillas, sables, foxes, rabbits, and racoon dogs make up a smaller proportion of farmed fur animals.

The collected information highlighted that measures and procedures vary widely from country to country. Fourteen of the 15 countries with a fur industry have implemented SARS-CoV-2 surveillance systems on fur farms. Nine countries have implemented surveillance systems to detect the virus in humans who work on the farms, and 8 have detected SARS-CoV-2 in mink farm workers.

Nine countries also reported that they analyse for variations in DNA sequences of SARS-CoV-2 viruses in animals, while 8 countries analyse for variations in DNA sequences of SARS-CoV-2 virus isolates detected in humans. The analyses have identified several combinations of mutations in mink-associated variants across countries.

The information also showed that both mandated and recommended biosecurity measures to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between animals and humans differ considerably across countries in the Region. This includes requirements for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), access to the farms, and movement of animals and workers between farms.

To prevent and reduce further spread between humans and fur-farmed animals, the One Health risk assessment provides a series of recommendations, in particular to

- enforce strict sanitary biosecurity measures against SARS-CoV-2;
- provide and ensure the use of appropriate PPE by farm workers and visitors;
- consider risk-based testing of animals for SARS-CoV-2 within the broader response to COVID-19;
- sample and test susceptible wild species and other free-roaming animals in the vicinities of SARS-CoV-2-infected fur farms;
- prevent farm workers with COVID-19 symptoms from entering farm premises;
- conduct whole-genome sequencing of viruses from human and animal cases and share virus isolates; and
- enhance surveillance for COVID-19 at the animal-human interface where susceptible animal reservoirs are identified, including fur farms.

[The full (20 pages) document, titled "SARS-CoV-2 in animals used for fur farming - global early warning system and risk assessment," can be downloaded at https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-fur-farming-risk-assessment-2021.1. Its summary follows:

"Summary.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as an emerging coronavirus in humans in December 2019. The 1st human cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, were first reported by officials in Wuhan City, China (People's Rep. of), in December 2019; the disease has since affected almost 100 million people, causing over 2 million deaths worldwide. Human-to-animal transmission and subsequent circulation in animals and transmission back to humans has been documented, in particular within farmed minks in several countries and, in a few cases, mink-to-human transmission has also occurred. To date, SARS-CoV-2 in animals has been identified in farmed-mink populations in 10 countries (Canada, Denmark, France, Greece, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the United States of America), with the 1st 2 mink outbreaks reported in the Netherlands as early as April 2020. While on some affected mink farms, clinical signs in animals could be observed, including respiratory or gastrointestinal signs (rarely), in most instances the only indication of virus circulation has been animal mortality levels slightly above baseline.

More recently, genetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 viruses circulating among workers of these farms and in surrounding communities confirmed the transmission from minks to humans. Furthermore, mutations have been observed on several occasions in virus variants circulating in mink populations, some of those variants then being also transmitted to humans, with the associated risk of possible modification of transmissibility and pathogenicity or reduction of efficiency of currently developed vaccines as well as candidate vaccines.

So far, genetic changes have not given rise to any change in clinical picture or epidemiology of COVID-19-infected mink farm workers, and cases appear to be similar to those in people infected with non-mink-related variants.

Using qualitative evidence and based on the likelihood and consequence assessed at the regional level with information available from 36 fur-animal producing countries, the overall risks at regional level of (1) introduction and spread of SARS-CoV-2 within the fur farms, (2) spillover from fur farms to humans, and (3) transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from fur farm animals to susceptible wildlife populations are minor in Africa due to the low volume of fur production and low human infection rate; moderate in the Americas and Asia considering the high volume of fur production in these 2 regions and the increase in human cases; and high in Europe due to highest number of fur farms compared to other regions concentrated in the same geographical areas, the high variety of susceptible animal species, and highest number of confirmed spillback events from the infected farms into the local community in some European farms.

The level of confidence in the risk estimates for the 1st 2 aspects is considered moderate due to the lack of data in many countries regarding the density of fur animals in farms, the number of fur farms, information regarding biosecurity measures, and SARS-CoV-2 in animal surveillance results in the fur-farming sector for both animals and humans, and the relatively low number of samples taken from fur-farm workers.

The level of confidence in the risk estimates for the 3rd aspect is considered low due to the lack of data related to diversity, density, and distribution of susceptible wildlife species at country, sub-national, and regional level."
