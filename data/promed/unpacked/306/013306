The Health Ministry will require all travelers from 7 virus-hit nations to quarantine upon arrival in Israel, it announced Thursday [29 Apr 2021].

Chezy Levy, the director-general of the Health Ministry, signed a public health order requiring all travelers -- including those vaccinated or recovered from COVID-19 -- from 7 countries dealing with coronavirus outbreaks to quarantine for 10-14 days upon entering the country. The countries are Ukraine, Ethiopia, Brazil, South Africa, India, Mexico and Turkey -- all of which Israel has issued a travel warning against.

The Health Ministry said the order, which still requires Knesset approval, will come into effect on Monday [3 May 2021].

In the face of the new coronavirus variant devastating India, the Health Ministry proposed new travel restrictions for Israelis earlier this week, which alongside mandating quarantine, would ban travel to the 7 high-risk countries. However, the urgent restrictions have not been implemented by the government because ministers in the outgoing coalition have been arguing over other issues this week.

The recommendations would also require non-citizens entering Israel from the specified highly infected countries to self-isolate in quarantine hotels.

Israel has identified 41 cases of the Indian coronavirus variant, including 5 in children, and 5 among people who were fully vaccinated. A top health official said Wednesday [28 Apr 2021] that it was not clear that COVID-19 vaccines offer protection against the [variant first detected in India] and cited the concern as a key reason why Israel must ban travel to countries with high coronavirus infection rates.

According to the ministry's statement, 24 cases of the mutated strain were found among people who returned recently from abroad, including 21 foreign residents. But 17 of those infected hadn't been abroad, and some of them had no obvious links to someone who did, indicating that the variant is spreading undetected.

Moreover, 5 kids from 5 schools were diagnosed with the [variant first detected in India]. Since the vast majority of children under 16 are not currently being vaccinated, this has raised fears of a new outbreak after infections have been steadily dropping for several months following the country's rapid inoculation campaign.

The Health Ministry is organizing widescale genetic sequencing tests in schools where the variant has been detected, though the ministry said it has "encountered difficulties in cooperating" with the Education Ministry to carry out genome sequencing at the schools. Two of the schools are in the Ma'ale Adumim settlement and the others are in Ashdod, Holon and Pardes Hanna.

Dr. Sharon Alroy-Preis, the ministry's director of public health, noted in a letter to the director-general of the Education Ministry that all of the schools except the one in Holon recently experienced coronavirus outbreaks. "Even if it is not currently known about confirmed [cases] at the schools, the combination of the presence of a variant that may be dangerous, the fact that there were recently outbreaks and the knowledge from the pandemic that children are asymptomatic in 70% of cases, requires quick sequencing to be carried out widely at the aforementioned schools, to ensure there is no morbidity," she wrote.

She also said the "the situation is particularly" concerning because kids aren't vaccinated and spend extensive time together in closed spaces. "If we can't sequence as required, we will need to consider closing the school or part of it," Alroy-Preis warned.

Data published by the ministry showed a total of 100 coronavirus cases were diagnosed Wednesday [28 Apr 2021] in Israel, with a 0.3% positive test rate. Active cases stood at 1570, serious cases at 118 and the number of patients in critical condition was 68, continuing the general downward trend.

[Thanks to Roland Hubner for the weblink to the post above. Rapid tests would be very useful in this situation, but they may have to be repeated over a number of days to be sure to pick up infection. Nonetheless, it might be preferable to quarantine.

Research commissioned by British Airways owner IAG, Virgin Atlantic and other airlines found that a single on-arrival antigen test is as effective as a 10-day self-isolation period in reducing imported cases of COVID-19 (https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-britain-airlines/rapid-covid-19-tests-work-as-well-as-quarantine-for-travel-research-idUSKBN2BH01B). - Mod.LK]

[2] Vaccine effectiveness
Date: Wed 28 Apr 2021

https://tinyurl.com/29798tph


The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna coronavirus vaccines are 94% effective at preventing hospitalization in fully vaccinated adults 65 or older, according to a small study released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Wednesday [28 Apr 2021].

The findings, which are consistent with the clinical trial results, are the 1st real-world evidence from the United States that the vaccines protect against severe COVID-19. Older adults are at the highest risk of hospitalization and death from the disease. More than 573 000 people have died across the country related to the virus, according to a New York Times database, and as of Wednesday [28 Apr 2021], 142.7 million people have received at least one dose of one of 3 federally authorized vaccines, including about 98 million people who have been fully vaccinated.

"These findings are encouraging and welcome news for the two-thirds of people aged 65 and up who are already fully vaccinated," Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the CDC director, said in a statement. "COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective and these real-world findings confirm the benefits seen in clinical trials, preventing hospitalizations among those most vulnerable."

The study is based on data from 417 patients who were admitted to 24 hospitals in 14 states between 1 Jan and 26 Mar [2021]. Approximately half were 75 or older.

Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require 2 shots, spaced 3-4 weeks apart. Older adults who were partially vaccinated -- that is, they had received one dose of the vaccine more than 2 weeks prior -- were 64% less likely to be hospitalized with the coronavirus than unvaccinated seniors, the researchers reported.

The vaccines did not reduce hospitalization rates in people who had received their 1st dose less than 2 weeks prior. The body requires time to mount an effective immune response, and people are considered fully vaccinated 2 weeks after the last dose in the series.

"This also highlights the continued risk for severe illness shortly after vaccination, before a protective immune response has been achieved, and reinforces the need for vaccinated adults to continue physical distancing and prevention behaviors," the scientists wrote.

https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/article/3131587/coronavirus-philippines-extends-lockdown-sri-lanka-sees-infections-spike


Singapore on Thursday [29 Apr 2021] recorded 16 new locally transmitted coronavirus cases, the 1st double-digit daily jump in months. The health ministry said 7 of these infections were family members of an earlier case involving a 38-year-old Singaporean who works as an immigration officer.

Eight cases were linked to an emerging cluster at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where a nurse tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday [27 Apr 2021]. Authorities said the affected ward had been locked down and that patients there were being swabbed and isolated. Staff at the hospital will also be tested, the health ministry said, adding that visitors will not be allowed into the wards.

Thursday's [29 Apr 2021] spike adds to a recent surge in community cases in the city state, which had the virus largely under control in the past months. Singapore has logged 46 local infections so far in April, compared to just 9 for the whole of March [2021].

Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, the co-chair of the republic's virus task force, last week said Singapore was on "heightened alert." Based on the health ministry's preliminary findings on Thursday [29 Apr 2021], only one case is unlinked, which meant that the figures would likely not affect the quarantine-free travel bubble that Singapore is readying with Hong Kong.

Under the announced rules, the scheme would be suspended if the 7-day moving average of unlinked infections in either city is more than 5, among other mechanisms.

The Philippines is extending an already month-long lockdown by 2 weeks as the country's worst coronavirus infection spike since the start of the pandemic starts to ease but remains alarming. President Rodrigo Duterte said in televised remarks on Wednesday [28 Apr 2021] night that the 2nd-most restrictive lockdown level will now run through 14 May in Metropolitan Manila and 4 nearby provinces, a region of more than 25 million people.

Mayors, however, cut a 9-hour night curfew in Metropolitan Manila to 6 hours to help battered businesses. Duterte warned mayors and village chiefs that they face jail if they do not prevent gatherings and other events that violate the pandemic restrictions.

"There will always be a rise ... [in COVID-19 cases] if we don't follow the law," Duterte said. "This is not only a medical issue. It is now of national interest and maybe the survival of the Filipinos."

The Department of Health reported 6895 additional COVID-19 cases on Wednesday [28 Apr 2021], pushing the country's total caseload to 1 020 495. The death toll was up by 115, to 17 031, it added. While the daily totals have declined since 29 Mar 2021, when the new lockdown was imposed, health experts have called for an extension of community quarantine to allow the numbers of stabilise.

There have been delays in the delivery of vaccines in the country, where only 1.5 million Filipinos have been given shots since the vaccination drive was launched at the start of March [2021]. The government has said it aims to inoculate up to 70 million people by the end of the year.

Elsewhere in the region, Sri Lanka this week recorded more than 1000 new COVID-19 cases in a single day for the 1st time since the pandemic began. The country has tightened curbs, closed schools and stepped up quarantine measures as it seeks to avoid a full lockdown that would jeopardise economic recovery and the reopening of its borders to tourists.

On Wednesday [28 Apr 2021], the government restarted its vaccination campaign by giving front-line workers in the health sector and the military their 2nd AstraZeneca shot, even as export curbs from neighbouring India have left Sri Lanka with inadequate supplies to cover all those requiring their 2nd dose.

To India's north, Nepal's Kathmandu valley on Thursday [29 Apr 2021] entered a lockdown amid a resurgence in coronavirus cases, officials said. The lockdown measures prohibit all businesses and services except the essential ones from operating and restrict unnecessary public movement in all 3 districts of the valley -- Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur -- according to Nepal Police spokesperson Basanta Bahadur Kunwar.

The total number of coronavirus cases in Nepal has reached 312 699, with 30 209 active cases and 3211 confirmed deaths as of Wednesday [28 Apr 2021]. The virus has also been detected at the Everest base camp, where hundreds of climbers are waiting for the final ascent of the world's tallest peak.

Meanwhile, Thailand added more measures on Thursday [29 Apr 2021] to arrest its biggest coronavirus outbreak yet, including a nationwide requirement to wear masks in public and a ban on dining at restaurants in and around its capital. Authorities reclassified Bangkok and 5 provinces as highest-controlled zones. There are 46 others with broad restrictions after a 3rd COVID-19 wave that has seen more than half of the country's overall infections this month alone.

Masks are widely worn in Thailand, but the order to make them mandatory comes just a few days after Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha was fined USD 190 for failing to wear one during a meeting. Parks, gyms, cinemas, bars, restaurants, day-care centres and schools have been closed in Bangkok, the outbreak epicentre, and non-essential travel from the capital is being discouraged.

Neighbouring Viet Nam now faces a "very high" threat of a new virus outbreak as well, Deputy Prime Minister Vu Duc Dam has said, with the government concerned over possible infections tied to visitors from abroad. The country on Tuesday [27 Apr 2021] reported its 1st domestic virus case since 25 Mar [2021], after a hotel worker tested positive following contact with 11 quarantined visitors from India.

In Malaysia, Communications Minister Saifuddin Abdullah said on Thursday [29 Apr 2021] he had tested positive for the coronavirus, as the country's health authorities reported over 3000 new cases for the 2nd day in a row. Apologising "for the inconvenience caused," Saifuddin said he will quarantine at home while awaiting admission to a COVID-19 hospital, but "will continue to monitor and ensure that all the affairs of the ministry run smoothly."

Saifuddin's was among over 3330 new cases announced by the Ministry of Health on Thursday [29 Apr 2021], after over 3100 infections were reported on Wednesday [28 Apr 2021].

[4] UK: B1.671 variant cases
Date: Fri 30 Apr 2021 13:21 EDT
Source: Daily Mail [abridged, edited]
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9526599/Coronavirus-Indian-variant-cases-UK-rise-400-three-types.html


The proportion of UK COVID infections caused by the [variant first detected in India] spiked 8-fold in a fortnight at the start of April [2021]. Four hundred cases of the mutant strain -- linked to an explosion of cases in India -- have been detected in Britain since it was first spotted in February [2021]. While it accounted for just 0.2% of positive tests checked by laboratory scientists at the end of March, this had surged to 1.7% by mid-April.

Health chiefs have now split the B.1.617 variant, as it is known to virologists, into 3 distinct virus types because it has mutated into similar but genetically different strains. Scientists can't yet tell whether any of the 3 spread quicker than the [strain first detected in Kent], which is dominant in Britain. But they don't think it does based on current evidence, and also don't believe it is any more like to cause serious illness or death.

Early research suggests both the AstraZeneca vaccine, known as Covishield in India, and the Pfizer jab still work against the variant, as well as the country's home-made jab Covaxin.

Some areas of Britain have had clusters of multiple cases of B.1.617, and in Basingstoke it accounted for one in 5 positive tests in the most recent week, up to 10 Apr 2021. The numbers mean it has quickly become more prevalent than the [variants first detected in South Africa and Brazil], but this is likely linked to a surge of tests on travellers, while the others are known to have spread within the UK.

India is currently going through a catastrophic 2nd wave with overwhelmed hospital wards spilling out into the streets, bodies piling up in public and cremations taking place in parks and car parks. Medics fear up to 3 million people are catching the virus and 30 000 dying from it every day.

Doctors on the frontline have claimed the variant triggered the explosive outbreak, but others assessing the crisis say it was a perfect storm of insufficient social distancing and potentially the spread of the [variant first detected in Kent], which is known to spread fast.

In Britain, officials are keeping track of the variant and may launch surge testing in areas where it appears to be spreading -- currently most cases are linked to travel. Three cases were confirmed this week to have been found in Leicester, triggering a testing surge at a school in the city, and data from one of the science institutes tracking the variants showed Harrow and Hounslow in London are also hotspots.

Public Health England (PHE) said "case numbers remain low and geographically dispersed in England." It said extra contact tracing and testing is being done.

Figures about the variant have been published online by the Wellcome Sanger Institute, a science research facility in London that does most of the UK's coronavirus test sequencing to spot new variants. It said that in the week ending 10 Apr 2021, the most recent on records, 1.7% of positive tests sampled in a lab were caused by the variant known as B.1.617.

This was more than triple the 0.5% a week earlier and 8 times higher than 0.2% the week before that. PHE does not differentiate between cases that were caught within Britain and those imported by travellers, so it is not possible to know the cause of the spike.

Some of them are likely to be linked to people scrambling to get back into the country when it was announced this month [April 2021] that India would be put on the red list, banning people from travelling into Britain from the country. Everyone who came in before had to be tested before departure and twice again on arrival, which may be what picked up the cases because most of them have to be sequenced in a lab to check for variants.

Now, only UK citizens or residents will be allowed to come in and they must self-isolate in a hotel for 10 days as well as taking the tests. The vast majority of COVID cases in Britain are still the [variant first detected in Kent] (96%), and the [B1.671] strain is confined to localised cases or clusters of infections.

But the number of tests coming back positive for the variant has rocketed in the past 2 weeks. Last Thursday [22 Apr 2021] PHE data showed the number of confirmed cases had risen from 77 to 132, and it has now surged to 400, a 5-fold rise in 2 weeks. At the same time, PHE has divided the variant into 3 separate strains, simply named B.1.617.1, .2 and .3.

Type 2, only officially recognised yesterday [29 Apr 2021] for the 1st time, has already become the most dominant, with 202 cases. There are 172 cases of type 1, likely to have been the 1st one spotted in the UK, and just 5 cases of type 3.

The variants are only very slightly different -- type 2 is missing a mutation on the other 2 that is called E484Q, which experts suspect might help it to slip past immunity to other variants. Mutations in the same place -- location 484 on the genetic sequence -- have this effect in the [variants from South Africa and Brazil].

It is not yet clear how PHE distinguishes type 1 from type 3. PHE said in a statement: "We have identified cases of 2 additional variants, which are part of the same lineage and so are genetically similar. While closely related, their genetic profiles are different and have been designated as separate Variants Under Investigation (VUI) so that we can track them properly and take fast public health action as needed.

"VUI-21APR-02 does not have the mutation E484Q while VUI-21APR-03 shares the L452R and E484Q mutations found in VUI-21-APR-01. There is currently no evidence that these variants cause more severe disease or render the vaccines currently deployed any less effective.

"PHE is carrying out increased laboratory testing, in collaboration with international partners to better understand the impact of the mutations on the behaviour of the virus and to ensure all appropriate public health interventions are taken. Identified case numbers remain low and are geographically dispersed in England. Where cases have been identified, additional follow up of cases, testing of contacts and targeted case finding will be used to limit the spread of these variants."

The Wellcome Institute data show where the most cases have been found, picking out Leicester, Harrow and Hounslow as the hotspots, with 11, 6 and 5.5 samples testing positive per week since the variant was found. Some samples may be repeat tests on the same people so it is not possible to accurately say how many cases each area has.

Dr. Duncan Robertson, a COVID modeller at the University of Loughborough, said in a tweet:"Many of these are likely to be linked to travel."

Other places where the variant has been found are:

- South Gloucestershire and Wiltshire in the South West;
- Bournemouth, Eastleigh, Basingstoke, Wokingham, Bracknell Forest, Brighton & Hove, South Buckinghamshire, Slough, Three Rivers, Watford, Dartford, Welwyn Hatfield, Oxford, Aylesbury Vale and Milton Keynes in the South East;
- The London boroughs of Hillingdon, Harrow, Ealing, Hounslow, Brent, Barnet, Enfield, Haringey, Kensington & Chelsea, Hammersmith & Fulham, Kingston upon Thames, Sutton, Lambeth, Southwark, Lewisham, Bromley, Tower Hamlets, Newham, Waltham Forest, Redbridge and Barking and Dagenham;
- Basildon and Cambridge in the East of England;
- Peterborough, Northampton, Leicester, Coventry, Warwick, Redditch, Birmingham, Walsall, Wolverhampton, Telford and Wrekin and Nottingham in the Midlands;
- Cheshire East, Sheffield, Stockport, Kirklees, Bradford, Preston, Blackburn with Darwen, Bolton, Salford, Wigan, Knowsley and Sefton in the North West.

Leicester City Council this week announced it had launched a testing blitz at a school in the city after 3 people were confirmed to be infected with the variant. Health chiefs have not yet ordered surge testing because there is no evidence it is spreading in the community.

Professor Browne said "targeted testing" was being carried out at a local school "as a precautionary measure." The school was not named, and it is not known whether the cases of the B.1.617 variant are among pupils or staff members. Positive tests in a school may rattle health chiefs because it's likely the infected staff or pupils came into contact with other people.

City council bosses said the people had travelled before India was added to Britain's red list on Friday, but they didn't specify whether they went to India itself. Leicester -- which has repeatedly been a COVID hotspot -- has the 2nd biggest Indian community in England, with around 38 000 people making up 28% of the city's population.

What do we know about the [variant first detected in India]?
Real name: B.1.617

When and where was it discovered?
The variant was first reported by the Indian government in February 2021. But the 1st cases appear to date back to October 2020. Its presence in the UK was first announced by PHE on 15 Apr 2021. There have since been at least 400 cases spotted in genetic lab testing.

What mutations does it have?
It has 13 mutations that separate it from the original COVID virus that emerged in China -- but the 2 main ones are named E484Q and L452R. Scientists suspect these 2 alterations can help it to transmit faster and to get past immune cells made in response to older variants.

PHE officials said it has split into 3 distinct virus types, with types 1 and 3 both having the E484Q mutation but type 2 missing the change, despite having all the other hallmarks of the variant.

Is it more infectious and can it evade vaccines?
The L452R mutation is also found on the [variant from California] (B.1.429), even though the 2 evolved independently. It is thought to make the American strain 20% more infectious. The E484Q mutation is very similar to the ones found in South Africa and Brazil, variants known as E484K, which can help the virus evade antibodies. The [variant first detected in South Africa] is thought to make vaccines about 30% less effective at stopping infections, but it's not clear what effect it has on severe illness.

Professor Sharon Peacock, of PHE, claimed there was "limited" evidence of E484Q's effect on immunity and vaccines. Lab studies have suggested it may be able to escape some antibodies, but to what degree remains uncertain.

How deadly is it?
Scientists still don't know for sure. But they are fairly certain it won't be more deadly than the current variants in circulation in Britain. This is because there is no evolutionary benefit to COVID becoming more deadly. The virus's sole goal is to spread as much as it can, so it needs people to be alive and mix with others for as long as possible to achieve this. And, if other variants are anything to go by, the [variant detected in India] should not be more lethal.

There is still no conclusive evidence to show dominant versions like the [variants from Kent and South Africa] are more deadly than the original COVID strain -- even though they are highly transmissible. Doctors in India claim there has been a sudden spike in COVID admissions among people under 45, who have traditionally been less vulnerable to the disease.

There have been anecdotal reports from medics that young people make up two-thirds of new patients in Delhi. In the southern IT hub of Bangalore, under-40s made up 58% of infections in early April [2021], up from 46% last year [2020]. There is still no proof younger people are more badly affected by the new strain.

Should we be worried?
Scientists are unsure exactly how transmissible or vaccine-resistant the [variant first detected in India] is because it hasn't been studied thoroughly. The fact it appears to have increased infectivity should not pose an immediate threat to the UK's situation because the current dominant [variant from Kent] appears equally or more transmissible.

It will take a variant far more infectious than that to knock it off the top spot. However, if the Indian version proves to be effective at slipping past vaccine-gained immunity, then its prevalence could rise in Britain as the immunisation programme squashes the [variant from Kent].

The UK currently classes the [variant first detected in India] as a "Variant Under Investigation," a tier below the [variants from Kent, South Africa and Brazil]. But there are calls to move it up to the highest category. Scientists tracking the constantly evolving virus say it's still not clear if India's 3rd wave has been caused by the variant, or if it emerged at the same time by coincidence.
