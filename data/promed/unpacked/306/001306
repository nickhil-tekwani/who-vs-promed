Unidentified disease creates havoc in remote Bajura
--------------------------------------------------
The outbreak of an unidentified disease in remote Jukot VDC, north of
Bajura district, has claimed 16 lives to date. Starting from
mid-January, around 150 locals are reported to have been infected
with the disease. The situation in the area is alarming, as the local
sub-health post is without drugs.
"The disease had already claimed 3 lives during my stay," said Tek
Narayan Poudel, an official at the Regional Administrative Office in
Dipayal. He was in Bajura as Chief District Officer (CDO) on
deputation until 22 Jan 2003. "I had given directives to the doctors
in the district to monitor the situation, before my return. I am not
aware of the developments that took place afterwards."
However, the doctors had left the district before 23 Jan 2003,
according to sources.
The wards 1, 2, 3, and 9 are the most affected by the disease. The
disease in its initial phase is [similar to the] common cold. The
patient dies after 10-15 days of infection, according to Hari Rokaya,
a local from the VDC. The disease claimed 3 members of Pari Lal
Shahi's family at ward-9, according to him.
"The sub-health post in the village does not contain even simple
drugs. Since there are only children and women in the village, it is
almost impossible to carry a patient to the headquarters through a
rough 3-day walk," said Surat Bahadur Shahi, another local from the
VDC.
[Note from Dr. Shafey: Bajura district is a high-altitude Himalayan
region about 450 kilometers northwest of Kathmandu.]
