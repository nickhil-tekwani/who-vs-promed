WHO confirms 5 Vietnam H5N1 cases, lists lab test criteria
---------------------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) today [31 Aug 2007] recognized 5
human H5N1 influenza cases from Viet Nam dating back to late May
[2007], after publishing formal criteria for accepting positive test
results for H5 flu viruses from national laboratories.
The 5 cases include 4 fatal ones, which pushes Viet Nam's H5N1 toll
to 100 cases with 46 deaths. The country has the 2nd highest number
of avian flu cases, after Indonesia.
The 5 cases now confirmed by the WHO had been reported earlier by
Vietnamese authorities. The WHO apparently now has confirmed all the
cases announced by Vietnamese authorities this year.
So far this year [2007] Viet Nam has had 7 H5N1 cases with 4 deaths,
and the resurgence in human infections appears to have coincided with
fresh poultry outbreaks, mainly in the northern and Mekong delta
areas. Previously the country was widely hailed for keeping poultry
infections at bay with strict control efforts, including an
aggressive vaccination program, but many of the outbreaks this year
have occurred in unvaccinated flocks.
In a statement yesterday [30 Aug 2007] about new criteria for
accepting positive H5N1 findings, the WHO said it will now accept
positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results from national
reference laboratories that (1) have participated successfully in the
WHO's new External Quality Assessment (EQA) project and (2) have
accurately identified H5 flu viruses in at least 3 previous cases.
Tiffany Domingo, a technical officer in the WHO's outbreak and
pandemic communications department, told CIDRAP News today that the
WHO will now confirm positive H5N1 results from Vietnamese labs -- as
it did today for the latest 5 H5N1 case patients -- so long as the
labs meet the new testing criteria.
The WHO did not say which labs in Viet Nam fulfilled the
requirements, but in a 29 Jun [2007] statement on Viet Nam's 93rd and
94th cases, the agency said the H5N1 infections were confirmed by the
National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE) in Hanoi, as
well as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Most countries that have had human H5N1 cases have had to send
specimens to WHO reference labs elsewhere for testing and
confirmation. However, the WHO has accepted positive H5N1 results
from a few countries, such as China and, in recent months, Indonesia.
In May [2007] the agency said it had formally assessed the Indonesian
national laboratory's capacity to diagnose H5 viruses and would begin
recognizing cases confirmed there.
Established in July [2007], the EQA project is conducted by the WHO
Global Influenza Programme at WHO headquarters in Geneva and the WHO
reference laboratory at the National Influenza Centre in Hong Kong,
according to a WHO statement issued in July. The program is designed
to build the capacity of labs to use PCR to diagnose both seasonal
and avian influenza and to support good laboratory practices.
National influenza centers and laboratories are eligible to participate.

[It is reassuring to see that Viet Nam meets the new WHO criteria for
laboratory diagnosis, given the magnitude of the H5N1 problem there.
One hopes that this will inspire other countries to meet the criteria as well.
