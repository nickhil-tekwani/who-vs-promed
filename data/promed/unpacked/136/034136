Health officials say they have been unable to determine whether
Murray Valley encephalitis [virus infection] caused the death of a
Sunraysia man last week [week of 6 Mar 2011]. The man died in hospital
in Melbourne after showing symptoms of the mosquito-borne disease. The
Health Department says there are no more test results pending, so the
case is likely to remain a suspected case of Murray Valley
encephalitis.

The disease has been showing in sentinel chickens in communities
along the Murray River, but there have been no other reports in
humans.

The department says there are now 600 cases of Ross River virus
[infections] in Victoria, with about 1/3rd of cases coming from each
of the Grampians and Loddon-Mallee regions.

The "disease emergence" parameters for these ever-present threats are
of interest, and it is important to go a bit beyond rainfall and
mosquito bites (the important immediate practical thing for public
health) and more into the overall ecology.

If my understanding is correct, MVE viraemia doesn't last very long
in infected hosts, and post-exposure immunity is strong and
protective, so there probably needs to be a quite rapid amplification
cycle in immunologically naive reservoir hosts to create the critical
mass conditions for spill-over to occur, particularly if/when
susceptible host population densities (e.g. humans, horses) are
relatively low.

Whilst sentinel chicken flocks, etc. are very important for early
warning of risks from MVE, Ross River, Barmah Forest, etc., my
perception is that they tend to start detecting virus activity quite
close to when public health (and animal health) consequences emerge
(probably after "spill-over" has well and truly started occurring). It
often isn't feasible/practical/realistic to do much timely "routine"
direct sampling of the wild bird reservoirs or the mosquito vectors,
so I am always seeking more sensitive early indicators of likely
spill-over (aside from just warm season rainfall) to forewarn of
outbreaks, and for better (more cost-effective) ways to gather some of
that data (e.g. tapping into recreational enthusiasts who are likely
to be able to report breeding activities and/or nesting densities in
primary bird reservoir species, if that is, indeed, a suitably
sensitive indicator, as I suspect it may be).

The main saving grace with MVE is possibly that the density of
immunologically naive people inhabiting the highest risk endemic areas
in northern Australia (far northern WA, NT and QLD) and PNG are very
low, and the disease doesn't extend in significant amounts into the
areas inhabited by still quite low densities of immunologically naive
people very often.

I was really fishing for some more authoritative input from the
ecologists somewhere to try to complete the reservoir-vector-clinical
host picture somewhat, particularly the "dispersal" versus
"congregation" issues for the reservoirs; wild anasids (ducks) in
Australia, for example, tend to disperse in the wetter seasons (where
they then also breed), but others probably congregate in at least some
key areas.

My understanding is that main bird reservoir species for MVE
(Cormorants, Ibis, Spoonbills, Egrets, some Herons) tend to be
communal breeders in rookeries (with high nest densities), so if any
congregate during the wetter periods, they probably might. They don't
always breed every year everywhere because they need reasonably
sizeable "reliable" bodies of water to provide food sources, etc. for
their rookeries during the breeding season. When conditions are
favourable however, they surely breed like crazy. Places like the
Macquarie marshes and the Menindie lakes on the Murray/Darling in
south western New South Wales and Lake Eyre in South Australia
certainly provide sizeable bodies of reliable water after a season
like this one.

[Of the 2 virus infections mentioned in the 1st above report, Murray
Valley encephalitis is by far the most serious. Ross River virus
infection produces a clinical picture of fever with flu-like symptoms
and sometimes with arthralgia. Previously this year (2011),
mosquito-borne Murray Valley encephalitis virus infections have been
found in horses in South Australia's Riverland and caused the death of
a horse in northwest Victoria.

Ross River virus cases in Victoria have increased from 15 reported on
15 Jan 2011 to 600 now.
