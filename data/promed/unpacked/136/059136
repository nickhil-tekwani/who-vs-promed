[The last occurrence of ASF in Haiti was in 1984. Unfortunately, due to the situation of ASF in the Dominican Republic, it's not surprising that ASF is now reported in Haiti. The outbreak is located near the border with Dominican Republic.

"Anse-a-Pitres is a commune in the Southeast Department of Haiti. Part of the Belle-Anse Arrondissement, it lies on the coast of the Caribbean Sea, approximately 140 km (85 miles) south of Port-au-Prince, immediately adjacent to the border with Dominican Republic. The town occupies the southeasternmost corner of Haiti."
