[Eric has recently returned from Taiwan, where he met with various informed
persons both in the equivalent of the Taiwanese ministry of agriculture and
at the Taiwan Pig Research Institute, soon to be renamed Animal Technology
Institute of Taiwan, with regard to the foot and mouth disease (FMD)
outbreak in Taiwan. Because Eric's contacts travel to and from the People's
Republic of China (PRC) and run the risk of being imprisoned, their
identities have been deleted. With permission, this is Eric's report of his
conversations. - Mod.MHJ
In a nutshell: it would appear that the 1997 foot and mouth disease
outbreak in Taiwan (1997) was a natural outbreak. The amount of smuggling,
especially of meat products from the PRC to Taiwan, is such that it is
surprising that it did not happen earlier. It is somewhat distressing that
animal diseases are apparently out of control in the PRC, although mainland
officials put a different public face on the situation.
In 1999, the Taiwanese authorities seized some 1000 tons of meat products
smuggled into Taiwan from the PRC, including pig stomachs, intestines,
pork, beef tripe, etc., and this may represent only 10% of the total amount
actually reaching its destination. These meat products also include live
animals.
The DNA sequencing by Pirbright of the Taiwan FMD isolate matched very
closely an FMDV strain found in the Philippines, and was found to be very
virulent, with a 12-24 hour incubation period.
The original isolate from the Taiwan FMD outbreak in 1997 was sent to the
Pirbright collection in Hong Kong before the July 1997 takeover by the PRC;
the strain closely matched a Hong Kong reference laboratory strain.
Nucleotide sequence data was then brought to the Lanzhou FMD research
laboratory, where the same (97-98%) degree of homology was found. The
strain is very stable, and after 2 years has remained essentially unchanged.
The FMD research laboratory at Lanzhou, PRC, has fairly good facilities
with competent workers. [Informant AA had met with government vets and
officials from the Chinese central government. FMD is classified
information in the PRC, coded "disease #5" (wu hao bing) in official
discourse. The PRC has claimed to be FMD-free since 1999, with previous
reports of FMD being found in Fujian and Yunnan provinces. However, when
Taiwanese pig producers visited the PRC more recently, FMD seemed to be
everywhere; in Guangdong, Shanghai, and Fujian provinces. When AA visited
the PRC recently he was asked in private by vets on the mainland if he
wanted to see cases of FMD in the local area.
No meteorological data have been used to plot a source of airborne FMD
virus. AA considers the airborne spread of FMD in Taiwan to be less likely,
due to higher temperatures and lower relative humidity. [We had discussed
whether the recent outbreak could have occurred through virus being blown
from the PRC to Taiwan. - Mod.MHJ AA has given up hope of determining an
index case for the 1997 FMD outbreak. The initial misdiagnosis was caused
by having relied upon EM of a picornavirus conflated to represent Swine
Vesicular Disease (SVD).
Taiwan had at one time the highest pig density in the world, even higher
than that of the Netherlands, with about 400 pigs per square km. The supply
of meat is different in Taiwan. "Fresh pork" or special butcher cuts are
preferred, and pigs are routinely brought close to the distribution
channel, then slaughtered. Most production of live pigs are shipped across
country, especially from South to North.
Why did the FMD outbreak occur in 1997? Why not in prior years if
accidentally spread?
Since martial law lifted in 1987, smuggling of products from the PRC to
Taiwan has steadily increased. Before 1987, smuggling could result in the
death penalty; no such Draconian laws exist anymore, except perhaps for
drugs and illegal weapons.
OIE directs that only inactivated FMD vaccine be produced in the PRC. In
February in Guangzhou farmers were complaining of the poor effectiveness of
the PRC-made FMD vaccines. At the same seminar, the director of the Lanzhou
FMD laboratory promised the audience that the quality of the PRC-made FMD
vaccine would be improved. The normal government vaccine is inactivated and
should not be implicated in the spread of the disease. But veterinarians in
Guangzhou recommended the use of live vaccines, especially during
outbreaks. The question of who makes live FMD vaccines was met by silence.
The PRC book titled "Control of FMD" (or some such) has a chapter on how to
make attenuated FMD vaccines.
Government vets in Shanghai and Guangzhou have the impression that the
effective control of animal disease is being lost in the PRC, with bigger
farms, etc. It is suspected that the presence of animal disease in China is
one reason, among others, why the PRC has been reluctant to push entry into
WTO any faster. However, this information will have to be provided at some
point. The PRC is a member of OIE, but does not participate in regular
meetings.
The pig industry in Taiwan will not recover. There was serious debate in
Taiwan during the week of 4 Apr 2001. Complete eradication efforts for FMD
in Taiwan would be very difficult if attempted. Reasons: The disease could
easily return. Once vaccination is stopped following eradication and pigs
are found to be infected, the government will have to bail out the farmers
again. Smuggling of meat products is proving to be difficult to control.
The cost of pork production is relatively high in Taiwan, as they must
import most of the feed, including corn and soy beans from the US. Lastly,
Japan is on its way to being free of hog cholera/CSF. So even if Taiwan
rids itself of FMD, Japan can use the hog cholera issue to put up a trade
barrier against future Taiwanese pork imports.
The current pig industry in Taiwan continues to shrink every year, with
current inventory at 7 million head, and will probably fall to 5 million.
