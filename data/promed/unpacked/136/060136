For decades, cattle farmers have sent their livestock to graze on the sprawling Shamrock pasture, about 80 km [about 50 mi] south of Chaplin in southwest Saskatchewan. Shamrock is where a 4th-generation cattle farmer, has for years raised nearly a quarter of his cattle. It's the same place [his] father sent his cattle.

But some time between last Monday and Friday [3-7 Jul 2017], the cows and calves at Shamrock began to die. It's not known whether the deaths happened all at once or slowly over the course of the 4 days. But by the time the manager arrived on Friday [7 Jul 2017] afternoon, 200 of the approximately 680 cattle in a single field were dead.

The president of Shamrock Grazing Ltd., Glenn Straub, called [the farmer], who raced out to the field. He was met with a gruesome scene. "We [have] seen a tragedy," he said. "We simply [have] seen a terrible sight."

Other ranchers soon joined him, about 31 in total who have cows and calves there. "We all had the same feelings -- how did this happen? How did this happen?"

Since [Fri 7 Jul 2017], provincial authorities as well as the local RCMP [Royal Canadian Mounted Police] have been trying to piece together the mystery. The cause is still being determined, but the prevailing theory is dehydration and salt toxicity.

The area has been subject to drought in recent weeks, said Saskatchewan's chief veterinary officer, Betty Althouse. Officials believe this may have led to evaporation at the water source, resulting in higher concentrations of salt in the water.

"An analogy would be someone shipwrecked in the ocean," Dr Althouse told reporters this week. "They're thirsty, they're craving water, so they're going to drink the water. But ultimately the salt water will kill them."

Many of the dead cows and calves were found clustered around one "dugout" in particular -- the pools of collected rain and runoff where they drink. Investigators at the Western College of Veterinary Medicine in Saskatoon who were called in to assist have collected samples from the dugouts. Results are expected some time this week.

One of the 1st possibilities investigators considered was blue-green algae poisoning, a toxic algae that can occur in dugouts and result in fatalities. But Dr Althouse said that this usually results in liver damage, which wasn't the case at Shamrock. She said officials also ruled out an infectious disease such as anthrax. In those cases, cows and calves usually exhibit bloating or bleeding.

Instead, the cattle at Shamrock were found with their bellies and eyes sunken in -- signs of dehydration. When investigators reached out to pinch their skin, the skin stayed in a tented position rather than returning to its usual shape.

Dr Althouse added that, until the test results provide a definitive cause, it's "way too soon" to lay blame on any person or group.

Meanwhile, veterinarians and the ranchers have been working together to treat the surviving cows and calves -- some with electrolyte and IV solutions. All of them were immediately moved to an adjacent pasture, and in the time since were moved an additional 1.5 km [about 1 mi] away.

"It's an ongoing, emotional thing," Shamrock's Mr Straub said. Mr Straub himself is a farmer, and has cattle at the pasture -- although not in the field in question. But many of the affected ranchers are his long-time friends and neighbours. So far, the estimated total loss to the ranchers,
based on average cattle prices, is about CAD 300 000 [about USD 236500].

This is a sad situation and likely may not be over. Animals suffering from water deprivation (dehydration) and salt intoxication may die 1-3 days later depending upon how long they were without water, and or how much salt they consumed. Occasionally this disease may also be called water intoxication as the salt to water ratio in the brain changes and water rushes to the brain, killing the animal.

Swine are the most sensitive to this condition and sheep are the most resistant. Cattle are next in line of sensitivity, after the pig. Generally if animals are provided plenty of access to clean water, higher levels of dietary salt may not be an issue. Some medications may be high in salt.

Environmental condition, such as heat and dryness, may be contributing factors to this condition. Ponds, tanks, mud holes, creeks, etc., dry up or concentrate what salt is there. Alternatively, excessive cold temperatures where water is frozen may also cause this problem.

Lactating animals have a higher requirement or need for fresh water. Consequently they may be more susceptible than non lactating animals.

Excessive salt (sodium chloride, NaCl) intake can lead to the condition known as salt poisoning, salt toxicity, hypernatremia, or water deprivation-sodium ion intoxication. The last term is the most descriptive, giving the result (sodium ion intoxication) as well as the most common predisposing factor (water deprivation). Salt poisoning is unlikely to occur as long as sodium-regulating mechanisms are intact and fresh drinking water is available.

Salt poisoning has been reported in virtually all species of animals all over the world. Although salt poisoning has historically been more common in swine (the most sensitive species), cattle, and poultry, there are increasing reports of adverse effects in dogs from acute excess salt consumption. The acute oral lethal dose of salt in swine, horses, and cattle is approximately 2.2 g/kg; in dogs, it is approximately 4 g/kg. Sheep appear to be the most resistant species, with an acute oral lethal dose of 6 g/kg.

In cattle, signs of acute salt poisoning involve the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system. Salivation, increased thirst, vomiting (regurgitation), abdominal pain, and diarrhea are followed by ataxia, circling, blindness, seizures, and partial paralysis. Cattle sometimes manifest belligerent and aggressive behavior. A sequela of salt poisoning in cattle is dragging of hindfeet while walking or, in more severe cases, knuckling of the fetlock joint.

Postmortem examination may reveal some degree of gastric irritation, including ulceration and hemorrhages. The content of the GI tract may be abnormally dry. Histopathologic lesions may be limited to the brain and include cerebral edema and inflammation of the meninges. During the 1st 48 hours, swine develop eosinopenia, eosinophilic cuffs around vessels in the cerebral cortex and adjacent meninges, and cerebral edema or necrosis. After 3-4 days, eosinophilic cuffs are usually no longer present. Cattle do not develop eosinophilic cuffs but can have edema of the skeletal muscles as well as hydropericardium. Extremely acute cases may have no lesions.

Hopefully a full necropsy with samples going to a veterinary diagnostic lab is being done. Brains may be important to help diagnose this condition. The levels of sodium in the brain can help rule in or out this condition.

There is no specific treatment for salt poisoning. Immediate removal of offending feed or water is imperative. Fresh water must be provided to all animals, initially in small amounts at frequent intervals to avoid exacerbation of clinical signs. On a herd basis with large animals, water intake should be limited to 0.5 percent of body weight at hourly intervals until normal hydration is accomplished, usually taking several days. Severely affected animals can be given water via stomach tube. The mortality rate may be greater than 50 percent in affected animals regardless of treatment.

For all affected animals, the treatment should slowly return the animal to normal water and electrolyte balance over 2-3 days. Quickly lowering the serum sodium concentration will increase the osmotic gradient between the serum and the brain, with water following the gradient into the brain and increasing the likelihood of severe cerebral edema.

Monitoring serum sodium concentration is the 1st step in treating individual animals. Serum sodium levels should be lowered at a rate of 0.5-1 mEq/L/hr. The use of slightly hypertonic IV fluids has been recommended to reduce the likelihood of cerebral edema. IV fluids can be made to approximate the serum sodium concentration of the animal, or a solution containing sodium at 170 mEq/L can be used initially, with the concentration decreased as clinical signs improve. In dogs, a series of warm water enemas given at intervals of several hours has helped reduce acutely increased sodium levels. If brain edema is suspected, mannitol, dexamethasone, or DMSO [dimethyl sulfoxide] may be helpful.
