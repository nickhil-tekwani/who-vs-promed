The number of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) cases in Klang has
increased, and people have been advised to seek immediate medical
treatment if symptoms occur.
Klang MP [Member of Parliament] Datin Paduka Dr Tan Yee Kew said 502
HFMD cases had already been reported in the 1st half of this year
[2007] compared with 300 cases throughout the whole of last year
[2006]. Dr Tan advised parents and kindergarten operators in Klang to
look out for symptoms of HFMD in children. She said kindergartens in
Bandar Bukit Tinggi, Taman Eng Ann and Taman Pendamar Indah had to be
closed to control the spread of the disease. She said doctors testing
samples of the HFMD [cases] here had found that the virus strain was
different from the one in Sarawak.

[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) can be caused by several enteric
picornaviruses: Human enterovirus 71, Human coxsackievirus A16, Human
echovirus 11 and Human echovirus 4 being the most frequent. HFMD
disease, although present worldwide, has caused most concern in
China, Japan, Malaysia and South-east Asia. (HFMDV is a pediatric
disease unrelated to the foot-and-mouth disease affecting ruminants
and some other animals).
The above report does not identify precisely the etiologic agent in
this outbreak. Both coxsackievirus A16 and echovirus 71 have been
recorded in Malaysia previously. According to Podin et al. (BMC
Public Health. 2006 Jul 7;6:18), since 1997, Sarawak has experienced
3 major outbreaks of human enterovirus 71 infection; in 1997, 2000
and 2003. Since the virus causing the current outbreak in Selangor is
believed to be different from that responsible for the Sarawak
outbreaks, the etiologic agent in Selangor currently may be coxsackievirus A16.
