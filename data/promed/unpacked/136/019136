H5N1 hits Laotian poultry farm
------------------------------
Animal health officials in Laos today [14 May 2010] reported that the
H5N1 avian influenza virus struck a poultry farm in Vientiane, the
country's capital, according to a report to the World Organization
for Animal Health (OIE). The outbreak killed 44 of the farm's 1004
susceptible layer chickens. The birds started showing symptoms on 27
Apr 2010. Mortality dramatically increased from 1 May through 5 May.
The remaining birds were culled to control the spread of the virus,
and authorities disinfected the premises and are conducting
surveillance in a 5-km [3.1-mile] radius around the farm. The source
of the outbreak has not been identified. The outbreak is the
country's 1st in more than a year.

[The Immediate notification to the OIE on the above outbreak,
including a map, is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=9250>.
It includes also the following epidemiological comment:

"The layers started to show clinical signs on 27 Apr 2010 and from 28
to 29 Apr 2010, 2 layers died. The 1st 2 dead poultry were submitted
to the National Avian Influenza Laboratory. At the laboratory,
necropsy of the 2 whole carcasses was performed as well as rapid test
to detect influenza A and H5; results were slightly positive for
avian influenza. Movement control measures of poultry and poultry
products were effective.

From 1 to 5 May 2010, the mortality of the poultry increased
drastically in the farm and the farmer sent some more whole carcasses
to the laboratory. The samples were tested using rapid test and were
positive for influenza A and H5. On 6 May 2010, the samples were
retested for confirmation using real-time PCR and results were
positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1.

Actions for containing the spread of the infection were applied such
as culling of infected and potentially infected poultry and
disinfection of the premises; both were completed on 7 May 2010.
Active and passive surveillances are on-going within 5 km [3.1-mile]
radius around the infected farm. In addition, movement control is
also effective."

The previous occurrence in Laos of HPAI H5N1 was April 2009. - Mod.AS]
