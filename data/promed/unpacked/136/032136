The New Mexico Department of Health announced today [23 Jan 2011] that
a 51-year-old woman from McKinley County is hospitalized in critical
condition at UNM [University of New Mexico] Hospital in Albuquerque
with the state's 2nd diagnosed case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
[HPS] this year [2011]. An environmental investigation will be
conducted to determine where the woman may have been exposed to the
virus.

"Cases of hantavirus [infection] in the winter are not as common as in
spring and summer and are usually due to rodents seeking shelter and
food in homes and other buildings due to the cold weather," said Dr
Paul Ettestad, the Department of Health's public health veterinarian.
"Being aware of your surroundings so that you avoid disturbing areas
of rodent infestation, rodent nests, and droppings is very important
along with making sure your house is sealed up so that rodents cannot
enter."

People can become infected and develop disease from hantaviruses when
they breathe in aerosolized virus particles that have been transmitted
by infected rodents through urine, droppings, or saliva. The deer
mouse is the main reservoir for the strain of hantavirus that occurs
in New Mexico, Sin Nombre virus. The Department of Health urges
health-care workers and the general public to familiarize themselves
with the symptoms of hantavirus [infection].
