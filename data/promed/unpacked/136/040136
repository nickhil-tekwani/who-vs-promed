Information received on 5 May 2004 from Dr Brian Evans, Executive
Director, Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), Ottawa:

End of previous report period: 14 Apr 2004 (see Disease Information,
17 [16], 113, dated 16 Apr 2004).

End of this report period: 3 May 2004.

As of 3 May 2004, in the overall Control Area, a total of 40
commercial flocks have tested positive for avian influenza:

- 13 premises within the 5-km High-Risk Region, where the index case
was diagnosed;

- 5 premises within the 10-km Surveillance Region surrounding the
High-Risk Region;

- 22 premises outside the Surveillance Region, but within the limits
of the Control Area that was established to contain the outbreak.

These 40 farms raised a total of 1 205 133 birds, which have been eliminated.

147 birds have also been destroyed in 10 positive backyard flocks.

As planned, the CFIA is now depopulating all flocks within the
Control Area, targeting 1st those flocks where disease is confirmed
or suspected and those premises within a 1-km radius of such premises.

The birds from flocks testing negative can be sent to slaughter. To
date, over 200 such farms have been identified. The birds are
subjected to federal ante- and post-mortem inspection, and the
derived products destined for human consumption may be moved out of
the Control Area under permit. However, such products are prohibited
from entering federally registered processing or storage
establishments elsewhere in Canada and will be clearly marked to
limit their use to direct retail, hospital, restaurant or
institutional use in Canada (domestic consumption).

Regular updates are available on the CFIA website.

[The 9 new flocks uncovered since the last OIE report are located
outside the Surveillance Region, but within the limits of the Control
Area. Authorities anticipate slaughtering 19 million birds at
present. Control efforts at the border to the United States have
been instituted, including truck washing. Unfortunately, this
outbreak -- perhaps due to the particular strain of influenza
involved -- will not "go gentle into that good night." - Mod.PC]
