--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract
--------
Background: Polyclonal convalescent plasma may be obtained from donors who have recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The efficacy of this plasma in preventing serious complications in outpatients with recent-onset COVID-19 is uncertain.

Methods: In this multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 convalescent plasma, as compared with control plasma, in symptomatic adults (≥18 years of age) who had tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, regardless of their risk factors for disease progression or vaccination status. Participants were enrolled within 8 days after symptom onset and received a transfusion within 1 day after randomization. The primary outcome was COVID-19-related hospitalization within 28 days after transfusion.

Results: Participants were enrolled from 3 Jun 2020 through 1 Oct 2021. A total of 1225 participants underwent randomization, and 1181 received a transfusion. In the prespecified modified intention-to-treat analysis that included only participants who received a transfusion, the primary outcome occurred in 17 of 592 participants (2.9%) who received convalescent plasma and 37 of 589 participants (6.3%) who received control plasma (absolute risk reduction, 3.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 5.8; P = 0.005), which corresponded to a relative risk reduction of 54%. Evidence of efficacy in vaccinated participants cannot be inferred from these data because 53 of the 54 participants with COVID-19 who were hospitalized were unvaccinated and one participant was partially vaccinated. A total of 16 grade 3 or 4 adverse events (7 in the convalescent-plasma group and 9 in the control-plasma group) occurred in participants who were not hospitalized.

Conclusions: In participants with COVID-19, most of whom were unvaccinated, the administration of convalescent plasma within 9 days after the onset of symptoms reduced the risk of disease progression leading to hospitalization.

Discussion
----------
In this randomized trial involving outpatients with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection, the administration of COVID-19 convalescent plasma decreased the incidence of hospitalization. The number needed to treat to avert one hospitalization was 29.4. Immune serum or plasma has been used safely to treat infectious diseases for more than 100 years.

COVID-19 convalescent plasma is available in low-income and middle-income countries, has no patent limitations, and is relatively inexpensive to produce, since many single donors can provide multiple units, as was evident from this trial. Because it provides a diverse mix of antibodies with different specificities and functions, COVID-19 convalescent plasma should be less vulnerable to the emergence of antibody resistance.

Our trial has important public health implications, especially in resource-constrained areas with imbalances in vaccine distribution. COVID-19 convalescent plasma can be considered for initial use in patients with COVID-19 and for use in future pandemics while monoclonal therapies and vaccines are being developed.

[2] SARS-CoV-2 placentitis

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract
--------
Objectives: To report the causative relationship of maternal COVID-19 with intrauterine fetal death, describe the specific placental pathology, findings of fetal autopsy and clinical characteristics, and identify potential risk factors.

Methods: This is a prospective case series. A cohort of 165 placentas of non-vaccinated pregnant women affected by COVID-19 in Greece were histologically examined, and 6 cases of intrauterine fetal death associated with SARS-CoV-2 placentitis were retrieved. Complete fetal autopsy was performed in 3 cases. Gross, histopathological, immunohistochemical, molecular, and electron microscopy examinations were carried out in the stillbirth placentas and fetal organs. The histological findings of SARS-CoV-2 placentitis were compared with the 159 cases, in which maternal COVID-19 resulted in livebirth. Regression analysis was used to identify predisposing factors for SARS-CoV-2 placentitis.

Results: All 6 stillbirth placentas showed severe and extensive histological changes of SARS-CoV-2 placentitis, i.e., a combination of marked intervillositis with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate and massive perivillous fibrinoid deposition with trophoblast damage, associated with intensely positive immunostaining for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the presence of virions on electron microscopy and a positive RT-PCR test in placental tissues. The histological lesions obliterated over 75% of the maternal intervillous space, accounting for intrauterine fetal death. Similar histological lesions affecting less than 25% of the placenta were recorded in 7 liveborn neonates, while the remaining 152 placentas of COVID-19-affected pregnancies with livebirths did not show similar findings. Complete fetal autopsy showed evidence of an asphyctic mode of death without evidence of viral transmission to the fetus. The mothers had mild clinical symptoms or were asymptomatic, and the interval between maternal COVID-19 diagnosis and fetal death ranged from 3 to 15 days. Statistically significant predisposing factors for SARS-CoV-2-placentitis included thrombophilia and IUGR. Multiple sclerosis was seen in one case.

Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 placentitis occurred uncommonly in COVID-19-affected pregnancies of non-vaccinated mothers and, when extensive, caused fetal demise, with no evidence of transplacental fetal infection. Thrombophilia and prenatally detected IUGR emerged as independent predisposing factors for the potentially lethal SARS-CoV-2 placentitis.

Contribution
------------
What are the novel findings of this work?
This study provides a novel insight into the histology and pathophysiology of the potentially lethal for the fetus SARS-CoV-2 placentitis, identifies thrombophilia and IUGR [intrauterine growth restriction] as independent predisposing factors for this lesion, and generates the hypothesis of a synergistic effect between the virus and underlying maternal risk factors.

What are the clinical implications of this work?
COVID-19 may uncommonly cause intrauterine fetal death due to a specific type of placental injury, SARS-CoV-2 placentitis, potentially induced by specific predisposing factors. The lesion evolves rapidly and, in its initial stages, appears undetectable by ultrasound. Risk groups may include mothers with thrombophilia and prenatally detected IUGR.

Over the last 7 days, 9403, 586, 1572, 145, and 1232 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, respectively, compared with 12 367, 715, 2584, 190, and 2964 in the preceding 7 days, revealing a decreasing trend of the disease in all the 5 South Asian countries mentioned compared with the previous week.

The trends of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths attributed to the disease in Pakistan can be seen at https://covid19.who.int/region/emro/country/pk.

In the last 7 days, only 4 persons died due to COVID-19 in Bangladesh, and in Nepal, no one died from the disease.

As of 1 Apr 2022, at 08:00 IST (GMT+5:30) India has administered 1 843 189 377 doses of COVID-19 vaccine (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/).

Bangladesh has a plan for vaccinating 70% of the population. As of 30 Mar 2022, 107.09% have received the 1st dose and 93.25% of the target population have received the 1st and 2nd doses. Around 8.51% of the target population have also received a 3rd dose as a booster vaccination (http://103.247.238.92/webportal/pages/covid19-vaccination-update.php).

As of 1 Apr 2022 at 09:16 PKT (GMT+5), a total of 237 931 825 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in Pakistan (https://ncoc.gov.pk/).

As of 20 Mar 2022, Nepal has administered at least 42 654 571 doses of COVID-19 vaccine (https://covid19.who.int/region/searo/country/np).

Sri Lanka has administered at least 39 102 567 doses of COVID vaccines so far. Assuming every person needs 2 doses, that is enough to have vaccinated about 89.7% of the country's population (https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/sri-lanka/).
