The source of a spate of _E. coli_ [O157] infections across South
Australia (SA) remains a mystery as authorities yesterday, 12 Feb
2007, admitted they were not confident of finding the cause.
Public health director Dr. Kevin Buckett said finding the origin of
the potentially fatal bacteria was proving to be an uphill battle.
"We're not overly confident but we're working very hard to track it
(the cause) down," Dr. Buckett said. "We'll keep pursuing it as far
as we can."
The admission came as the Health Department confirmed 3 new cases of
_E. coli_ infection. There have now been 10 cases reported in 2007,
which is more than a quarter of the average yearly total.
"Here in SA, we get around 30 to 40 cases of all strains of _E. coli_
each year," he said. "These cases are usually quite sporadic and
occur throughout the year. "When we get a lot of cases occurring at
once and they seem to be linked in some way, then I guess we call
this an outbreak," Dr. Buckett said.
He said the fact that the infected people lived in different areas --
including one in regional SA -- and were aged between 2 and 81 years
of age, made identifying common links difficult.
Flinders University gastroenterologist Professor Graeme Young said
finding the cause of the outbreak would involve a degree of
"detective work". "I think that if there isn't a common factor
between the people, it makes it very hard to understand why this is
happening," Professor Young said.
