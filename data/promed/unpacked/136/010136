500 goats die of PPR disease in Nilphamari
-------------------------------------------
Nilphamari: Some 500 goats died of PPR disease in 14 unions of Sadar
Upazila during the last one week till Fri 10 May, reports UNB.
Doctors and owners of goats said blood dysentery is the symptom of the
disease. Sources said on an average, 100 to 150 goats are being attacked
every day with the disease in the area. The treatment of the affected goats
is being hampered due to insufficient medicines in the district and [in
the] Thana veterinary centres. The worst affected areas are Chapra Saran
Jani, Kundupukur, Charahkhola unions of Sadar Upazila.
Admitting the death of the 500 goats, Assistant Veterinary Doctor of the
District Animal Husbandry Office said generally this disease breaks out
after flood or other natural disaster. But the disease has broken out here
due to early rains. Due to the outbreak of the goat disease, many people
are selling their affected animals in different bazars of Sadar Upazila at
throwaway prices.
Conscious people urged the concerned authorities to take necessary steps to
check the disease.

[PPR was first detected in Bangladesh in 1993, in the west of the country.
Its incidence decreased since 1998, but -- according to a report of the
Bangaladeshi authorities, submitted to the OIE in March 2001:
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_53.HTM#Sec3>
-- a noticeable increase in the incidence of PPR was detected, in Feb
2001, spreading rapidly from the west into other districts, causing high
morbidity and mortality. The populations of goats affected were found in
family holdings throughout extensive and often contiguous urban, suburban,
and village environments. Virtually the entire goat population of
Bangladesh -- approximately 20 million animals -- was declared to be "at risk".
The report further stated that a locally isolated and attenuated strain of
virus was undergoing evaluation for use as a vaccine; initial results of
efficacy and innocuity testing and field trials in more than 15 000 goats
were very promising, and an attempt was said to be made to produce
sufficient vaccine to immunize at least a proportion of the population at
risk in areas of the country not yet affected. Bangladesh "refrained from
using the tissue-culture rinderpest vaccine, in order not to compromise the
country's position on the OIE pathway to verify freedom from rinderpest".
Similar situations have been recorded during the last decade in several
other Asian and Middle-Eastern countries. The use of the rinderpest
(Plowright) vaccine -- which is known to render immunity against PPR in
small ruminants -- is problematic, since its use "incriminates" a country,
becoming "rinderpest infected", even if its cattle are free of rinderpest,
without vaccination, for extended periods. Bangladesh's experience with the
specific PPR vaccine is thus of great interest. Any relevant details from
our Bangladeshi colleagues or from the involved international organizations
will be very much appreciated. - Mod.AS]
