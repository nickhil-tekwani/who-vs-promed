Race against sharpshooter takes place on many fronts
-----------------------------------------------------
The multibillion-dollar wine grape industry in California is battling a
deadly bacterium carried by the glassy-winged sharpshooter. After the
half-inch-long insect turned a manageable level of Pierce's disease into a
devastating epidemic in Southern California vineyards last fall, government
and industry officials mobilized to keep it from invading the rich fields
of Northern California. But this month, they realized the insect likely
arrived about a year ago and is probably here to stay.
Conventional tactics are limited, making the scientists' battle urgent on
two fronts: the immediate attempt to stall the spread of the sharpshooter
and the lengthy fight against _Xylella fastidiosa_ the Pierce's disease
bacterium it carries.
"We're trying to slow the spread (of the insects) to give the researchers
time, but the only way we're going to be able to solve the problem in the
long term is to focus on the bacterium," said Patrick Gleeson, executive
director of the American Vineyard Association. More than half of the $3
million that government and industry have committed against the disease
goes to research on the bacteria, which causes disease in several species
of plants.
Meanwhile, scientists are chipping away at the mystery of the disease from
many angles. Grapevines with Pierce's disease die because _Xylella_ chokes
off the water and nutrients that the vines soak up from the ground.
Many aspects of the disease remain a mystery, such as how the bacteria not
only survives the rush of sap into a sharpshooter's throat, but goes
against the flow and into the plant. Scientists also are tackling questions
about how plants respond to the bacteria; for example, though cold
temperatures alone don't kill the bacteria, freezing seems to help vines
recover from the disease.
At UC Davis, Andrew Walker breeds dozens of new grape strains and sorts
through libraries of genetic information in search of the perfect vine. But
the work is slow: Plants take 2 to 3 years to develop to where they can be
tested for Pierce's disease resistance. The key to speeding up his work
lies in DNA "markers," or patterns that Walker sees when he fragments the
DNA and groups the fragments by size. Each grape strain has its own
pattern; by comparing the patterns of hundreds of lines with different
levels of disease resistance he learns which patterns "mark"
disease-resistant grapes. Unfortunately, success in his quest to breed
high-quality grapes that resist the _Xylella_ bacterium is at least 10
years away.
Other researchers in Brazil recently mapped the entire genome of a strain
of _Xylella_ that costs Brazil's orange industry more than $50 million a
year. Now they are mapping the strain that causes Pierce's disease. The
team can now search for genes that allow _Xylella_ to kill plants and focus
on developing an antibiotic to kill the pathogen.
Until scientists can strike the disease directly, efforts to stall its
spread remain essential to the health of the wine industry. Although
insects such as the blue-green sharpshooter have been spreading _Xylella_
in California for more than a century, the arrival of the glassy-winged
sharpshooter radically changed the way Pierce's disease spreads.
Previously, _Xylella_ mainly reached vineyards via the blue-green
sharpshooter, which only infected tender vines near the outer edges of the
vineyard. Since those green vines died away each fall, the disease could be
pruned out of the vineyard.
However, the larger glassy-winged sharpshooter sucks from the tougher,
permanent portions of the vine. Unless the entire plant is removed, it will
remain a source of the bacterium in the following year. The glassy-winged
sharpshooter also travels faster than the blue-green sharpshooter, enabling
vine-to-vine spread throughout the vineyard.
Scientists will probably soon deploy more powerful enemies of the
sharpshooters: non-stinging parasite wasps, including species not native to
California, which lay eggs in the sharpshooter's eggs, killing them before
they hatch. But the only parasitic wasp native to California is not active
enough when sharpshooters are hatching in the spring; instead it breeds in
the summer. UC Davis scientists collected parasitic wasps in Mexico which
may have promise as bio-control agents. It and 2 species from the Southeast
are quarantined at the University of California, Riverside. Scientists have
finished ecological safety tests for one Southeastern species, trigatatus,
and await U.S. Department of Agriculture approval breed
and release it. Most likely they will begin raising small armies of
trigatatus and release them later this summer. The wasps may prove useful,
especially in Southern California, where glassy-winged sharpshooters abound.
The glassy-winged sharpshooter has become a permanent resident of Southern
California, and experts are beginning to realize it may be in Northern
California to stay. Though the wasps may buy time, "bio-control will never
work for eradication," said Walker.

[The nature of resistance to the bacterium remains to be determined, and
that's where the effort must be intensified. I tend to agree with Walker's
assessment that bio-control may only be a temporary measure. I hope I'm
wrong. -Mod. DH
