The University of Calgary veterinary school has diagnosed a fatal case of H1N1 in a domestic cat. The cat was one of 2 that died in a Calgary household. These are believed to be the 1st feline cases of pH1N1-09 in Canada, the university said in a release.

The flu shot offers good protection against serious illness for 2014. The flu strain has been reported sporadically in cats, ferrets, and dogs in other countries.

It is assumed that the route of transmission was from humans to cat. There are no known reports of cat-to-human transmission, but that risk cannot be excluded by veterinarians, the university said.

Two cats in the city have died recently as a result of the H1N1 flu virus. It is believed the animals picked up the virus from someone visiting the family over the holidays.

Dr Alistair Cribb at the U of C Faculty of Veterinary Medicine said they are spreading the word: "We've communicated this out to the veterinary community in Alberta because they need to be aware in case they see cats," Cribb said. "We've all known this was a possibility, and we've informed the chief provincial veterinarian who has informed Alberta Health."

These are the 1st cases in Canada, but Cribb notes that there is not a serious risk for cats or dogs. There is no proof the animals can spread the virus to people.
