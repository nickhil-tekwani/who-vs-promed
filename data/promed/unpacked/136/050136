[Having a good contact in Novosibirsk, I passed the above postings to
Sergey Netesov. He has been travelling but on his return made further
enquiries and replied as follows, for which we are very grateful. -MHJ

From: Sergey Netesov <netesov@vector.nsk.su>

The incident is over already. There is only one patient now still being
treated now at Novosibirsk Regional AIDS and Infectious Disease Center
which is located at VECTOR. The county physicians firstly failed with the
correct diagnosis, and the regional authorities, after suspecting anthrax,
decided to transfer the patients to this Center. We really participated
only in delivering the patients here.
Firstly there were FIVE patients. No mortal cases were registered. Three
patients were from Nizhne-Cheremoshnoe village, Krasnozersk raion (county);
one - from Krasnozersk, involved with butching and one - from Novosibirsk -
loader, who loaded carcasses of cows in Novosibirsk for burning. The last
person is still treated.
[Earlier I had commented about our infrastructure problems with North
American farmers and ranchers not reporting possible anthrax deaths in
livestock. He commented:
The case you described could occur in our area too, and I supposed firstly
the same origin of this Siberian local outbreak.
But the real situation was as follows: cows became ill, it was something
like diarrhea, and the veterinary officer participated in butchering the
first cow (it was not an emergency slaughter). He had never seen such a
picture before - the spleen had a 1 meter length, intestine was fully lying
in blood, etc. He returned to his office and started to study the
literature, it was Friday (or Saturday) evening. He understood the
situation only very late and started to call the hospital and to try to
find participants at the butchering. He also immediately started to eat a
huge amount of tetracycline. Monday morning all of them were on the way to
hospital. In the same time, the epidemiologists were trying to find a few
carcasses which had been sent two or three days earlier to Novosibirsk.
They had been found just before unloading. The day was very hot and loader
had only a shirt on his body. As a result he also came to the hospital and
is still under treatment.
A lot of work has been done to fix the situation. A few dozens of cows were
slaughtered and burned. A few hectares of meadows were treated by bleach.
The cow barns were thoroughly treated (if not burned) too. This veterinary
officer was among these five patients. He is healthy already. Only one
person - loader from Novosibirsk is still in Hospital.
So, the lesson from this situation - practically all the veterinary
officers in the Region have not seen anthrax in real life and forgot its
first symptoms. Fortunately, this one officer understood it when everything
could been fixed with minimal possible harm. I am sure that during the next
four-five years every veterinarian in Novosibirsk Region will be very
careful.
