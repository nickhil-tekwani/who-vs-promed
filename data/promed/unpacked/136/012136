Two people in China have been diagnosed with plague, the latest cases of a disease more commonly associated with historical catastrophe.

Plague is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ and can arise in 3 forms -- a lung infection, known as pneumonic plague; a blood infection, known as septicemic plague; and a form that affects the lymph nodes, called bubonic plague. This infection was behind several pandemics including the Black Death of the late middle ages, which is estimated to have killed up to 60% of the European population.

The 2 new cases being treated at a hospital in Beijing are of the pneumonic form, which is even more serious than bubonic plague. According to the CDC, plague typically spreads to humans who have handled an infected animal or who have been bitten by a flea hosted by an infected animal. However, in the case of pneumonic plague, it can be spread when an infected person coughs. Pneumonic plague is highly contagious and is fatal if not treated quickly with [antimicrobials].

The WHO said it understood that close contacts were being screened and managed. "The [Chinese] National Health Commission are implementing efforts to contain and treat the identified cases and increasing surveillance," said Fabio Scano, of WHO China.

It is not the 1st time in recent history that China has dealt with cases of plague. In 2014 the city of Yumen was sealed off and 151 people were placed in quarantine after a man died from the disease.

According to the CDC, plague -- largely of the bubonic form -- continues to crop up in rural areas of the USA, including northern Arizona, southern Colorado, and southern Oregon. In 2014 there were 16 cases and 4 deaths in the USA, including that of a man from Utah thought to have come into contact with an infected flea or dead animal.

Recent epidemics have been reported in Africa, Asia, and South America, predominately in rural regions. The WHO reported 3248 cases and 584 deaths from plague worldwide between 2010 and 2015.

In 2017 Madagascar had an outbreak of plague, with 2348 cases and 202 deaths, of which 1791 cases were pneumonic plague.

This year, 2019, in Mongolia a couple died from plague apparently after eating raw marmot kidney, triggering a 6-day quarantine in the region.

Two people have been diagnosed with pneumonic plague in Beijing, local health authorities confirmed Tuesday [12 Nov 2019].

According to the government website of Chaoyang District in Beijing, 2 patients from north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region were diagnosed with pneumonic plague, which doctors in Beijing confirmed Tuesday [12 Nov 2019].

At present, the 2 patients have received proper treatment in a relevant medical institution of Chaoyang District, and relevant disease prevention and control measures have been taken.

The Chinese government announced Tuesday [12 Nov 2019] that 2 people in Beijing have been diagnosed with pneumonic plague, a deadly pandemic, once known as the Black Death, that killed tens of millions of people across Europe in the Middle Ages. The 2 patients were 1st treated in Inner Mongolia, a sparsely populated area in northern China, but after persistent respiratory problems and high fever, 2 symptoms of the plague, they were taken to a hospital in Beijing's Chaoyang District. A local news outlet said police quarantined the patients' room on Monday night [11 Nov 2019], but a now-deleted social media post by a doctor at the hospital indicated the pair 1st sought treatment as long back as 10 days ago [3 Nov 2019].

The timeline of the diagnosis is significant for multiple reasons in assessing the pandemic risk of the highly infectious illness, which can be transmitted by humans. First, although the pneumonic plague is universally fatal when left untreated, if diagnosed and treated with antibiotics within 24 hours of showing symptoms, the recovery rate is high, according to the World Health Organization. That would make the timing of the initial hospital visit and when the patients showed symptoms particularly important, as well as whom they may have come into contact with in the meantime.

"On Tuesday [12 Nov 2019], Chinese censors instructed online news aggregators in China to 'block and control' online discussion related to news about the plague," according to a directive seen and reported on by The New York Times. "Skeptical Chinese internet users have charged the government with being slow to disclose news about the disease, which is transmitted between humans and kills even faster than the more-common bubonic form. China has a history of covering up and being slow to announce infectious outbreaks, prompting many people to call for transparency this time."

[The cases occurred in Inner Mongolia and were transferred to Beijing for therapy. Based on the 3rd post stating that the illness or illnesses began 10 days before and that without therapy plague pneumonia has a rapid progression to death, it is likely that the cases began with bubonic plague and spread to the lungs in at least one case.

Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a "bubo". Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, as appears to have happened in this case, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of "primary" plague pneumonia. - Mod.LL
