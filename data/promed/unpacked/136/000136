Brazilian Government Underestimated Losses With Rust
-----------------------------------------------
Losses due to soybean rust are now estimated to exceed earlier
estimates. Embrapa points to farm damage of USD 2.7 billion due to
soybean rust, a value which includes productivity losses and extra
expenses with fungicides. The estimate of the Ministry of the
Agriculture was for USD 2 billion in this harvest (2005/2006). In the
2004/2005 season, the damage was estimated to be USD 1.285 billion.
"This was the worst year for level of incidence of soybean rust in
Brazil, with the most serious losses happening in Mato Grosso and in
Minas Gerais," said Jose Tadashi Yorinori, a researcher at Embrapa
Soy (Brazilian company of Agricultural Research). The Alert Service
provided by Embrapa, which is maintained in partnership with the
Ministry of Agriculture, identified 1419 rust foci in the whole
country in the 2005/2006 harvest, compared to 459 foci in the
2004/2005 harvest.
He observed that the loss of seed was smaller because in many states
the producers increased the number of applications of fungicides,
which elevated the costs of farming. On average, the number of
applications rose from 1.7 to 2.5 applications. In Mato Grosso, for
instance, productivity fell from 60 to 38 bags per hectare as a
result of the disease. Tadashi said that the damage in those farms
was around USD 200 per hectare.
A crop-free period of 90 days between the end of one crop and the
planting of the next crop is being proposed for Brazil. The rule is
already adopted in Mato Grosso and in Goias.
According to Embrapa, since the appearance of the disease in Brazil
in the 2001/2002 season, losses equaled 12.4 million tons of seed and
USD 7.7 billion in income.

[The crop plant soybean (_Glycine max_) develops symptoms of the
disease Asian soybean rust when infected by the fungus _Phakopsora
pachyrhizi_, Asian strain. In addition to soybean, cowpeas, green
beans and other edible legumes can be affected by the ASR pathogen,
which causes defoliation and yield reduction. Kudzu (_Pueraria
lobata_, a.k.a. Japanese arrowroot) is an important alternate host
for the pathogen.
The pathogen had been limited to the Eastern hemisphere until it was
found in Hawaii in 1994. Currently, the distribution of _P.
pachyrhizi_ includes Africa, Asia, Australia, South America, the
continental USA (since November 2004), and Hawaii. The rapid spread
of _P. pachyrhizi_ and potential for severe yield losses makes this
the most destructive foliar disease of soybean. Because this posting
deals with ASR in Brazil, the items in the archive below are for
reports of soybean rust in the Americas excluding the USA.
Asian soybean rust has been known to drastically reduce yields in
Asia. In areas where the pathogen occurs commonly, yield losses up to
80 percent have been reported. Asian soybean rust was 1st detected in
Brazil in 2001/2002, and its impact on production is newsworthy.
The article gives information on the impact of Asian soybean rust on
soybeans in Brazil in the current (2005/2006) crop season. It also
summarizes past losses. The 2005/2006 crop season appears to have
been the most heavily impacted by ASR to date in Brazil. It is noted
that high costs of fungicides, which did increase yields, contributed
significantly to the overall economic losses associated with managing
ASR. This information is of interest to USA soybean growers as they
continue to evaluate the possible impact this pathogen will have on
their own production were ASR to become epidemic. In Brazil, soybeans
can have overlapping seasons, and so disease can carry from crop to
crop from soybean to soybean. This is not the case in the USA. It is
unlikely that a disease-free period will be suggested as a means to
manage ASR in the USA, though is seems like a sensible approach in
Brazil. A comparison of ASR in Brazil and the USA is provided in the
2nd item in "Links" below.
