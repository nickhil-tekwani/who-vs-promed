[According to a 27 Feb 2015 report in the media: "Myanmar authorities have raised the alert levels, to prevent the rapid spread of the virus in the country. Thousands of birds have been culled in an attempt to contain the epidemic, particularly in Monywa, a town west of Mandalay, in the north western region of Sagaing. Since the beginning of the month [February 2015], when the 1st signs of bird flu appeared on a poultry farm in the area, more than 1400 chickens and about 10 000 quail have died from the H5N1 virus. As a precautionary measure, the authorities ordered the culling of another 1500 samples of poultry and over 20 000 quail. In the area there are more than 300 companies engaged in the production of poultry and 100 in quail, for a total of 140 000 chickens and more than 500 thousand quails." (http://www.asianews.it/news-en/WHO-sounds-alarm-over-spread-of-Bird-flu-after-massive-cull-in-Myanmar-33576.html).

There is a discrepancy between the number of affected birds reported by the media and those reported officially to OIE. According to the official information submitted for this H5N1 event, only 350 birds were reported dead (including both chickens and quail), whereas the media reports "1400 chickens and about 10 000 quail" dead. There is also a discrepancy in the number of birds slaughtered or destroyed between the 2 reports. It would be useful to know the correct numbers of birds dead, affected, and slaughtered or destroyed, and whether these are associated with these 3 officially reported outbreaks or are associated with other additional outbreaks which have not yet been reported.
