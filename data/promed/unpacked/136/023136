A new yellowing disease in _Phaseolus vulgaris_ associated with a
whitefly-transmitted virus
-----------------------------------------------

Mediterraneo s/n, 04745 La Mojonera, Spain. Accepted for publication 19 Mar
2004.

During the autumn of 2003, a new disease was observed in French bean
(_Phaseolus vulgaris_) grown commercially in Spain. Symptoms resembling
nutritional disorders consisted of interveinal mottling and yellowing in
leaves, combined with stiffness or brittleness and were produced on the
middle to lower parts of plants. Affected plants were all observed in
greenhouses infested with _Bemisia tabaci_ [Bt]. Reproducible symptoms were
observed when the virus was transmitted from bean-to-bean by Bt (9/10) but
not by mechanical inoculation (0/30).

Electrophoresis of double-stranded (ds) RNA extractions from
field-collected samples and Bt-inoculated plants revealed a high molecular
weight dsRNA doublet, consistent with the bipartite genome of criniviruses
(Celix et al., 1996).

cDNA transcripts were produced and amplified by RT-PCR from
agarose-purified dsRNA species by Uneven PCR (Chen and Wu, 1997).
Individual amplicons were cloned into pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega, WI,
USA), sequenced and then analyzed using Blastx (NCBI, Bethesda, USA).

The nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence from 1 amplicon
(GenBank accession AY543165) showed the highest percentage identity with
the heat shock protein 70 homologue from members of the genus _Crinivirus_
such as Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus (CYSDV) (respectively 57
percent and 67 percent), Beet pseudo-yellows virus (BPYV) (respectively 54
percent and 63 percent) and Tomato chlorosis virus (ToCV) (respectively 52
percent and 57 percent).

RT-PCR analysis with designed specific primers (forward primer
5'-TTATGTATGATCTAGGCGGAGGTC-3' and reverse primer
5'-CTGGGTCAATGATACAAGTTAGTC-3') produced an amplicon of the expected size
(465 bp), when using total RNA extracts from diseased plants and
viruliferous whiteflies.

This is the 1st report of a yellowing disorder in bean associated with a
Bt-transmitted virus, with molecular and epidemiological features
consistent with criniviruses (Wisler et al., 1998).

Based on the host range and the unique partial genome sequence, we suggest
the name Bean yellow disorder virus (BnYDV) to describe this new virus.

[Closteroviruses belong to the family _Closteroviridae_ which consists of 2
genera (_Closterovirus_ and _Crinivirus_). These viruses are transmitted by
aphids, whiteflies or mealybugs, depending upon the virus. The outbreak of
BnYDV in early 2004 occurred in approximately 20 percent of all
bean-producing glasshouses in 3 Spanish provinces (Almeira, Granada and
Malaga) destined for the fresh market. Yield losses have been reported from
25-100 percent, depending on local conditions. Disease management will
depend upon reducing populations of Bt as well has clearing away vegetation
that might support the vector.

The delay in posting this piece is because I only found it recently. It is
a 2004 piece but will have to be a 2005 posting.
