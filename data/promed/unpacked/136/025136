A Costco wholesale store in South San Francisco, California, is recalling at least 47 000 more pounds of rotisserie chicken and products made with the cooked bird -- including foods sold directly to consumers through 15 Oct 2013 -- because they may be contaminated with salmonella linked to an ongoing outbreak. Department of Agriculture food safety officials say it appears that the chicken was contaminated in the store's preparation area after cooking. The recall comes less than a week after the single Costco store at 1600 El Camino Real, South San Francisco, recalled about 40 000 pounds of cooked chicken and products tied to an outbreak associated with Foster Farms chicken that has sickened at least 317 people in 20 states.

The new recall includes 13 455 Kirkland Signature Foster Farms rotisserie chickens and 638 units of Kirkland Farm rotisserie chicken soup, cooked chicken leg quarters, and chicken salad. The products were sold between 24 Sep 2013 and 15 Oct 2013, according to a notice issued Thursday by the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service.

The previous recall included 8730 chickens and 313 units of prepared foods sold between 11 Sep 2013 and 23 Sep 2013. The birds weigh between 3 pounds and 4 pounds apiece, according to Craig Wilson, Costco's vice president of food safety. Based on a 3.5-pound chicken, that's an estimate of 47 000 pounds.

Costco's birds are typically cooked to 180 deg F [82 deg C], well above the 165 deg F [74 deg C] needed to kill salmonellae, Wilson said. But cross-contamination can occur from other sources. In this case, the bacteria could have been splashed as workers mopped floors or could have been transferred when a worker got bacteria from a raw bird on a smock and the transferred it to the cooked chicken, Wilson said. The firm has changed cleaning and smock-changing procedures in response. "I am highly confident that this is the solution," Wilson said.

Inspectors say the cooked chicken was tainted with a rare type of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Heidelberg not normally found in the USA, one of strains associated with an ongoing outbreak linked to raw Foster Farms chicken parts.

Illnesses associated with eating the Costco chicken are part of a larger outbreak tied to three Foster Farms production sites in Fresno and Livingston, California. USDA officials issued a public health alert for raw chicken made by the firms in October 2013 and threatened to close the sites by withholding inspections. But Foster Farms agreed to fix the problems that led to the contamination and federal officials agreed to allow the sites to remain open.

No recall has been issued for the production lots of Foster Farms chicken identified originally in the USDA's alert. The lot numbers would be included in the USDA inspection symbol or elsewhere on the package: P6137, P6137A, and P7632. Foster Farms officials could issue a voluntary recall, but they've chosen not to, saying that their products have been inspected by the USDA and are safe to eat if handled properly and cooked thoroughly.

Officials with the CDC are tracking the outbreak, which has sent more than 40 percent of victims to hospitals, about twice the typical rate for salmonellosis. Some of the strains of salmonellae detected in the outbreak are drug resistant and have caused illnesses that are hard to treat with some first-line antimicrobial agents.

[The previous posting regarding salmonellosis acquired from the roasted chicken cited "one or more" cases linked to the cooked chicken. It is not clear if additional cases have occurred linked to the cooked product but clearly some aspect of cooking hygiene was violated to allow the cooked chicken to be recontaminated.
