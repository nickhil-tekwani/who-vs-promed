EU confirms bird flu in Romania, bans imports
---------------------------------------------
The European Commission said on Thursday [13 Oct 2005] it
was banning the import of live birds and poultry from
Romania after its experts confirmed that a strain of avian
influenza had been detected in samples from a Romanian duck
and chicken.
"Given that it has been confirmed that the virus is present
in Romania, the Commission will now adopt the same measures
already taken for Turkey, last Monday [10 Oct 2005], that is
to say a ban on imports of live birds, poultry meat and
other poultry products," the Commission said in a statement.
The Commission said its experts had detected the H5 virus
strain in 2 samples taken in a suspected backyard farm in
the Danube delta. "Further tests are necessary to ascertain
if the virus in question is the H5N1 strain," it added.
The Standing Committee of the Food Chain and Animal Health
will hold an emergency meeting on Thursday to review the
situation, and by today a UK laboratory should also be able
to ascertain whether the virus isolated in Turkey earlier is
the H5N1 strain.

[It has taken a week of conflicting information before this
definite confirmation has become available. Romania has
notified the OIE on its initial suspicions in an alert
message, sent on 7 Oct 2005 (see
<http://oie.int/Messages/051010ROM.htm>). Similar
information, from other sources, has been received from
Christian Griot.
Final identification of the neuraminidase of the H5 strain
is urgently anticipated. - Mod.AS]
