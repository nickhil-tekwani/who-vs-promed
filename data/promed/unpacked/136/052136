The Valencia Department of Health has recorded a new case of legionellosis in Benidorm, which raises the number of related cases to 6 so far. Of these, 4 patients have been admitted to the Marina Baixa Hospital in Vila-Joiosa, where they are in stable condition. They all have the common history of frequenting the sports stadium of Palau d'Esports l'Illa in Benidorm.

The Center for Public Health of Benidorm continues epidemiological and environmental research and has proceeded to schedule cleaning and disinfection per regulations. When the investigation is complete, the situation will be evaluated to ensure that the stadium will re-open in the absence of risk.

The Department of Health reminds people that legionellosis is an infectious disease of environmental origin, produced by bacteria. It is transmitted by air, through inhalation of contaminated aerosolized water, such as from showers, toilets, and cooling tower water. They also note that person-to-person transmission has not been demonstrated.

The most common clinical presentation is pneumonia, which includes respiratory symptoms, fever, and headache. Legionellosis may also produce general symptoms such as fatigue, malaise, and muscle aches. It has an incubation period of 2 to 10 days.

For patients with legionellosis there is a well-established treatment, but there are no preventive medicines or vaccines. It is not necessary to see a doctor after having frequented the same place as the sick patients; medical attention should only be sought if symptoms suggestive of the disease develop.

[For discussions of legionnaires' disease, see my comments in prior ProMED-mail posts listed in the see also's below.

Genotyping of isolates has become a helpful tool to establish transmission pathways. The predominance of one genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from patient specimens would suggest transmission from a common source. Because _Legionella_ may be found in environmental samples without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative infectious reservoir can be confirmed by matching the genotype of clinical and environmental isolates (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/).

However, genotyping is often difficult in legionellosis outbreaks, because the diagnosis is frequently made only on the basis of urinary _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen testing or serology rather than isolation of the organism from cultures of respiratory tract specimens. Consequently, clinical isolates are often not available for genotyping.

Benidorm, with a population of 73 768 in 2013, is a coastal town in the province of Alicante, in the southern part of the Valencian Community of eastern Spain, on the Western Mediterranean (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benidorm). Formerly a small fishing village, Benidorm is known for its hotel industry, beaches, and skyscrapers and is reported to be Europe and Spain's biggest holiday resort, with 5 million tourists per year.

The news report does not say if the cases of legionellosis were local residents or tourists. According to the US CDC, more then 20 percent of all legionnaires' disease reported to the CDC is travel-associated (http://www.cdc.gov/legionella/health-depts/travel-identify-report.html). Travelers typically disperse to their homes widely separated from one another and perhaps at a very great distance from the source of infection before developing symptoms, so that a cluster of cases of legionnaires' disease in other travelers associated with the same source may not be noticed. A travel history is essential and should be actively sought from patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and _Legionella_ testing should be performed for those who have traveled in the 2 weeks before onset of symptoms. Cases of travel-associated legionnaires' disease need to be reported to the appropriate authorities to be able to detect these outbreaks. - Mod.ML
