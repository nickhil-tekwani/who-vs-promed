PESHAWAR, Sept 12: A spokesman of the NWFP [North West Frontier
Province health department said the water test report at village Sufaid
Dheri and other disease-affected areas, revealed that no cholera germs
were found in the water supply.
He said it was an outbreak of gastro-enteritis which had been controlled
to a great extent.
The spokesman further said six vaccination centres had been established
at Lady Reading Hospital, Hayat Shaheed Teaching Hospital, Hayatabad
Medical Complex, BHU Pishtakhara, BHU Kafoor Dheri and Civil Dispensary
Tehkal Payan since Saturday.
The spokesman has appealed the people to contact the centres where they
would be vaccinated free.

Although environmental isolation of _Vibrio cholerae_ is possible, the
primary laboratory objective at the beginning of such an outbreak is to
attempt vibrio isolation from affected cases. The NWFP health department
has 850 people in hospital producing liters upon liters of loose stool
and they're reporting on samples from water sources!
Then someone in the same department states that "This is not cholera,
but gastro-enteritis.... and please get your vaccines at any of the 6
centers we have set up." Reports in Dawn [online from yesterday
indicate that mass vaccination against *cholera* [emphasis added by
Mod.JW had been initiated.
There are reports of large cholera outbreaks from every country
bordering Pakistan. Until a reliable lab takes a sufficient number of
stool specimens from cases and fails to isolate vibrio, for all intents
and purposes this is a cholera outbreak and needs to be managed as one.

[We have held up this report in the expectation of an imminent official
report from Pakistan and WHO that this is not only cholera, but that it
is the O139 strain. Such confirmation has not been forthcoming -
