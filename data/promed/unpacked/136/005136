The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health on [28 Feb 2014] is investigating a case of community-associated Methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (CA-MRSA), a drug-resistant bacterium, affecting a woman aged 43, and hence appealed to members of the public to stay vigilant against CA-MRSA.

The patient, with underlying illness, developed a headache and collapsed on [12 Feb 2014] and was admitted to Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital on the same day. Upon admission, she was diagnosed as having intracranial haemorrhage and was subsequently transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for further management. She has presented with fever and increase in sputum since 15 Feb 2014.

The clinical diagnosis was pneumonia, and she is now in critical condition. Her endotrachael aspirate yielded CA-MRSA upon laboratory testing by the CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch.

Initial enquiries by the CHP revealed that the patient had no recent travel history. Her home contact has remained asymptomatic so far.

MRSA is a type of _Staphylococcus aureus_ that is resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. It is a common infection worldwide.

In recent years, many countries have observed MRSA infections in healthy individuals who have not been hospitalized or stayed in health-care facilities or institutions, or received medical procedures in the year before the onset of symptoms. They are known as CA-MRSA infections and usually have special patterns of antibiotic resistance.

"It is widely recognized that indiscriminate use of antibiotics may contribute to antibiotics resistance," a spokesman for the CHP said.

People are advised not to use antibiotics without professional medical advice. If they are advised by doctors to take antibiotics, they should take the medicine according to the prescribed frequency and dosage. People should observe good personal hygiene including washing hands with liquid soap frequently.

The public may visit the CHP's CA-MRSA page at http://www.chp.gov.hk/en/content/9/24/5392.html for further information and preventive advice.

[Molecular typing of _Staphylococcus aureus_ by 1) pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), 2) multilocus sequencing (MLST), i.e., DNA sequencing of internal fragments of multiple housekeeping genes, 3) spa typing, i.e., DNA sequencing of staphylococcal protein A gene variable repeat region, and 4) staphylococcal cassette chromosome _mec_ (SCC_mec_) typing are commonly used to characterize methicillin-resistant _S. aureus_ (MRSA) isolates.

The SCC_mec_ gene determines methicillin-resistance. In this regard, community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) are distinct from healthcare-associated strains (HA-MRSA). Unlike HA-MRSA, most CA-MRSA carry SCC_mec_ types IV or V and do not have resistance to multiple antimicrobial drugs, other than beta-lactams. SCC_mec_ types IV and V are small and, unlike other SCC_mec_ types, encode resistance to only beta-lactams, which may explain the non-multidrug resistance characteristic of CA-MRSA. HA-MRSA carry larger SCC_mec_ types I, II, or III, which carry additional genes that encode resistance to classes of antimicrobial drugs other than beta-lactams.

Using _S. aureus_ PFGE typing nomenclature established by the U.S. CDC (1), USA300 has become the predominant PFGE type for CA-MRSA in the U.S. (2). USA100 are multidrug-resistant strains of MRSA that are typically associated with health care-acquired infections. USA300 CA-MRSA usually carry the genes encoding the Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL), a toxin that predisposes to severe skin and soft-tissue infections and necrotizing pneumonia. USA300 is also characterized by having the arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME), MLST ST8, spa-sequence type t008, the _msr_(A) erythromycin resistance gene, and SCC_mec_ type IVa.

CA-MRSA have caused outbreaks of skin and soft issue infection, as well as invasive disease (e.g., bacteremia, endocarditis, necrotizing pneumonia, and osteomyelitis) in children in day care centers, military recruits, athletes participating in contact sports, IV drug users, prison inmates, men who have sex with men, Pacific Islanders, Alaskan Natives, and Native Americans, in which the infected, but otherwise healthy, individuals had no link to healthcare systems, unlike health care-associated (HA)-MRSA (2). Factors that have been associated with the spread of CA-MRSA skin infections in otherwise healthy people include close skin-to-skin contact, skin cuts or abrasions, contact with contaminated surfaces (e.g., gym equipment, shared towels), and poor personal hygiene.

USA300 genotype has more recently emerged as a significant cause of healthcare-associated infections in some medical facilities (3,4). Although CA-MRSA strains have been generally susceptible to a wider range of antibiotics, other than beta-lactams (e.g., fluoroquinolones and clindamycin), USA300 isolates are becoming more resistant to antimicrobial agents, including clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, mupirocin and tetracycline, and have spread to Europe, Japan, South America and Australia (2). Isolation of USA300 in regions outside the U.S. (5-7) has been attributed to importation from the U.S. due to international travel, with the potential for subsequent spread in the local communities.

Unlike the predominance of USA300 in the U.S., the molecular epidemiology of CA-MRSA in Asia is said to be characterized by genetic diversity (http://www.hkmj.org/supplements/article_pdfs/hkm0912sp9p9.pdf). CA-MRSA has rapidly risen in the Hong Kong community since the 1st detection of PVL-positive CA-MRSA in 2004 (http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/54/4/845.long). In one study, PFGE and multilocus sequence typing showed that most isolates were ST30-HKU100 and ST59- HKU200 clones (http://www.dmidjournal.com/article/S0732-8893(08)00003-5/abstract).

The newswire fails to report the molecular characteristics of the CA-MRSA strain isolated from the ill 43-year-old woman. Although the results of blood cultures are not mentioned in this case, with an intracranial hemorrhage and CA-MRSA pneumonia, she may very well have underlying _S. aureus_ endocarditis.

The U.S. CDC offers suggestions for preventing contraction and spread of MRSA infection applicable to those in community settings, including incarcerated populations, childcare center employees, and athletes. To prevent MRSA infection, individuals should regularly wash hands using soap and water or an alcohol-based sanitizer, keep wounds clean and covered, avoid contact with other people's wounds, avoid sharing personal items such as razors or towels, shower after exercising at athletic facilities (including gyms, weight rooms, and school facilities), shower before using swimming pools or whirlpools, and maintain a clean environment.
