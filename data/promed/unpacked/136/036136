An 11-year-old boy has died in Tbilisi [capital city of Georgia] as a
result of rabies virus infection on Fri 17 Dec 2010. He had been
transferred to the Tbilisi Infectious Diseases Hospital from Telavi
Hospital on the previous day. It is believed that he had been bitten
by a dog several days previously while visiting his relatives in
Azerbaijan. The child received post-exposure vaccination prophylaxis,
but the precise interval between exposure and vaccination has not
been revealed.

Another case of rabies was registered in Tbilisi in November [2010].
On that occasion, a 17-year-old youth bitten by a dog died from
rabies after failing to seek medical treatment until 3 months after the event.

[Dogs are the source of 99 percent of human rabies deaths, and canine
rabies is common in Georgia and the South Caucasus region of Eurasia.
The incubation period for rabies is typically 1-3 months but may vary
from less than one week to more than one year. The initial symptoms
of rabies are fever and often pain or an unusual or unexplained
tingling, pricking or burning sensation (paraesthesia) at the wound
site. As the virus spreads through the central nervous system,
progressive, fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord
develops. Therefore, it is imperative to seek immediate treatment by
the only option available: Post-exposure vaccination.
