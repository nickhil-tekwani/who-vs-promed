Human plague, that dreaded disease of centuries past caused by the
bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, is on the rise, at least in the southwestern
United States.
Biologists at the National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded Long-Term
Ecological Research (LTER) site in Sevilleta, New Mexico, have found that
human plague cases in New Mexico occurred more frequently after wetter than
average winter-spring time periods (October to May). In fact, during years
much wetter than normal, a 60% rise in the number of cases of human plague
resulted. The scientists report these results in a paper published in the
November issue of the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.
Plague occurs episodically in many parts of the world, explains Robert
Parmenter, director of the Sevilleta LTER field research station, and lead
author of the paper. "Some outbreaks appear to be related to increased
abundance of rodents and other mammals that serve as hosts for the fleas
that then transmit the disease to humans." Increased winter-spring
precipitation, say Parmenter and his colleague Ken Gage of the Center for
Disease Control office in Fort Collins, Colorado, enhances small mammal
food resources (plants and insects), leading to an increase in the
abundance of plague hosts. In addition, moister climate conditions may act
to promote flea survival and reproduction, also enhancing plague
transmission. "Our results can be used by physicians and public health
personnel to identify and predict periods of increased risk of plague
transmission to humans," Parmenter hopes.
Global climate dynamics are proposed by some scientists as the culprit in
recent outbreaks of infectious diseases; others warn that long-term global
warming could increase the risk of contracting such diseases. "The recent
El Nino events of the 1990s have been associated with large increases in
rodent populations in both North and South America," explains Scott
Collins, LTER program director at NSF. "These increases in rodent
populations have been shown to correlate with numerous diseases, including
Lyme disease and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Climate studies may provide
a forecasting tool for identifying periods of increased risk of disease
transmission."
Plague was introduced into North America via San Francisco, California, in
1899-1900 by shipboard transport of plague-infected rats from Asia. These
rats quickly infected native mammal populations, especially ground
squirrels, and plague spread throughout western North America. Plague is
now most commonly found in the southwestern United States -- in New Mexico,
Colorado, Arizona and California. Major risk factors for humans include
contact with diseased wild mammals or their infected fleas, and exposure to
infected fleas carried by pets like dogs and cats.
"If climate conditions become favorable for reproduction and survival of
either the wild mammal populations or their flea populations, then the
probability of human infection via animal-flea-human contacts will also
increase," write Parmenter and his colleagues.
With known risk of plague transmission following unusually moist winter-
spring seasons, localized public health warnings and heightened medical
surveillance can be arranged prior to the peak in human cases during the
summer, the scientists suggest. "Local physicians and health care
professionals can determine if their cities and towns have received higher-
than-normal precipitation, and increase their cognizance for plague
patients," the researchers write.

[Anything that increases rodent populations will lead to an increase in
rodent-associated disease. Therefore it is not only plague but also
hantavirus infections that will increase in those circumstances - Mod.JW
