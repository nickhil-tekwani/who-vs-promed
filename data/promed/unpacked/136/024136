A mysterious haemorrhagic disease suspected to be [Ebola haemorrhagic
fever] has killed at least 23 people and infected dozens more in
Sudan's under-developed south, a Southern Sudanese army official said
on Wednesday [7 Oct 2009).

The World Health Organisation says Ebola haemorrhagic fever, one of
the most virulent viral diseases known to mankind, was discovered in
South Sudan and the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo in
1976. Some strains [of ebolavirus] have a death rate of 25 to 90 percent.

Kuol Diem Kuol, spokesman for the South Sudan army (SPLA) said blood
samples had been sent to laboratories for testing but that doctors
suspected [the disease was Ebola haemorrhagic fever]. "So far there
have been 20 deaths in the SPLA and in addition 3 wives of soldiers
have died, he told Reuters. There is a huge number of the [general]
population affected also, but we don't have the (exact) number," he
added. A UN official in South Sudan said they had attempted an
assessment but needed more information from local government to be
able to evaluate the situation.

Kuol said symptoms included vomiting blood and bleeding from the ears
and nose, adding it was very widespread in the West Bahr-al-Ghazal state.

A 2004 outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever killed 7 people in the
south. Death rates in Sudan averaged around 50 percent of victims.

Health officials say there is still no known cure for the disease,
which is spread through bodily fluids, including blood.

South Sudan, emerging from decades of civil war, has little health
infrastructure and few medical staff.

[Viral hemorrhagic fevers can be caused by many different viruses,
including those classified in the families _Arenaviridae_,
_Bunyaviridae_, _Filoviridae_, and _Flaviviridae_. Laboratory
diagnosis is required to identify the particular agent involved. In
this outbreak an ebolavirus, a member of the family _Filoviridae_ is
suspected to be the cause of the outbreak on historical grounds
rather than on the basis of diagnostic data.

_Ebolavirus_ was first identified in a western equatorial province of
Sudan and in a nearby region of Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of
the Congo) in 1976 after significant epidemics in Yambuku in northern
Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Nzara in southern Sudan.
Between June and November 1976, _Ebolavirus_ infected 284 people in
Sudan, causing 151 deaths, and there was another outbreak in Sudan in
1979 with 33 cases, including 22 deaths. Overall, according to WHO,
about 1850 cases with over 1200 deaths have been documented since
ebolavirus was discovered. The exact origin, locations, and natural
reservoir of ebolaviruses remain unknown, but the Egyptian bat is now
thought to be a likely source (see ProMED-mail Ebola & Marburg
hemorrhagic fever, Egyptian fruit bat - W. Africa 20091006.3469).

The information in the Reuters report is insufficient to determine
whether the current outbreak in southern Sudan is due to ebolavirus
infection, or is a consequence of infection with another agent, or
due to another cause. Further information is awaited.
