[Translated & summarized by JW]

Laboratory tests done at the Instituto Adolfo Lutz, Sao Paulo, Brazil, have
confirmed that the death of a 29-year-old man from Sao Carlos, at the
beginning of April 2002, was due to infection by a hantavirus. The patient
developed a high fever & stomach pains a few days after having hiked a
rural trail. This was an official report from the municipal secretary of
health of Sao Carlos, Elisete Silva Pedrazzani.

[The infection was almost certainly not acquired during the actual hike in
the open air, but in a shelter along the way contaminated by wild rodent
excreta. ProMED-PORT moderator LJS comments that Sao Carlos is close to
Araraquara, where the hantavirus Araraquara virus was isolated in a
human. The rodent vector of Ararquara virus has not been identified. -
