The government intends to kill all cattle suspected to be infected
with foot and mouth disease [FMD] starting Sun 2 Nov 2008 to contain
the spread of the disease in Kuke.

Minister of Agriculture Mr Christian De Graaff said thereafter that
the government would upgrade the 1.4 meter high double cordon fence
separating Ghanzi and North West districts to a 2.4 meter high
game-proof fence. This will reduce the chances of wild animals and
cattle mixing and thus minimize disease transmission.

Addressing a kgotla [a public meeting, community council or
traditional law court of a Botswana village. It is usually headed by
the village chief or headman, and community decisions are always
arrived at by consensus. - Mod.AS] meeting in Ghanzi yesterday [30
Oct 2008], Mr De Graaff said veterinary agents would continue to
conduct surveillance in the adjacent farms to prove that the disease
had not gone beyond the infected zone. Infected or in-contact animals
will be destroyed.

Mr De Graaff said farmers whose cattle had been killed would be
compensated at Botswana Pula (BWP) 1500 [USD 188.55] per head
irrespective of the age, sex, breed or condition of the animal. "With
this strategy, we are optimistic that Ghanzi will regain its status
in 2 to 3 months," he said.

He said a countrywide ban on the movement of cloven-hoofed animals
and their fresh products had been imposed; all slaughter facilities,
including Botswana Meat Commission abattoirs in Lobatse and
Francistown, have been closed; and a countrywide inspection of cattle
to ascertain the extent of the outbreak had been started.

He added that the trace back and trace forward of all cattle that
have moved from and into the infected farms within the last 30 days
has also been started.

"We have informed the World Organisation for Animal health, our
trading partners and neighboring countries of the outbreak," he said.

Mr De Graaff said the spread of the disease into the Ghanzi District
meant that some loophole remained open. He said he had pleaded with
Ghanzi farmers to maintain their fences and with the public to desist
from bringing fresh animal products from Ngamiland and not to visit
farms and cattle posts in Ngamiland and those in Ghanzi without
exercising care. "It looks like my plea fell on deaf ears," he said.

The minister said the most likely way the disease must have spread
was through the movement of people from Ngamiland to Ghanzi. However,
if people were careful and decontaminated, there would not be a
problem. People were advised to take precautions, particularly those
handling cattle in Ngamiland and on the Ghanzi side. "Regrettably,
they have not heeded the advice, and that is why we are where we are
today with an outbreak," he added.

Mr De Graaff said wild animals, particularly Kudu, carry the disease
and that there had been a concentration of them in the
Kuke-Phefodiafoka area. The situation was exacerbated by the recent
veld fires that ravaged the CKGR and pushed the animals close to the
fence in search of grazing.

He asked the nation to cooperate with government officials in
combating this outbreak.

[Botswana submitted an immediate notification to the OIE addressing
the described outbreak on 28 Oct 2008; available with map at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=7459>.

Botswana pays much attention to the control of FMD because beef
exports contribute significantly to the economy of the country.
Continued access to lucrative world markets is dependent on freedom
from diseases such as FMD and CBPP. The country enforces a strict
livestock disease control policy based on early detection and
effective response. - Mod.AS]
