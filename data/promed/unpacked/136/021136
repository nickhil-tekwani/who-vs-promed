Mysterious disease destroys coffee
----------------------------------
[Nyamira] coffee farmers have called on agricultural officers to help combat a mysterious disease. During a meeting to discuss the crisis, the farmers blamed the Coffee Research Institute and the county government for failing to act in time to prevent the immense losses that have been witnessed because of the disease.

The farmers said the disease was affecting the roots of coffee trees leading to eventual falling of the trees in a record period of about 2 weeks. "We are in a deep problem because of the disease. It has uprooted a number of coffee trees and it's so fast. Coffee is our livelihood."

They urged officials to visit the region before the disease inflicts further damage to other trees and give a solution before the menace extends.

[While the symptoms described above are not sufficient for diagnosis, the problems may point to some form of root rot. Plants with root rot often can appear healthy and then collapse very quickly, for example under water stress.

A number of fungi are known to cause root rots in coffee (_Coffea_ spp), including species in the genera _Armillaria_, _Rosellinia_, _Rhizoctonia_, _Fusarium_, and _Ganoderma_. Fungus-like organisms in the genus _Phytophthora_ may also lead to similar diseases and have been reported to affect macadamia trees in Kenya (ProMED-mail post 20100901.3119). These pathogens are usually spread with soil, contaminated tools, and human activities.

Reliable diagnosis is needed before control measures can be devised. If root rot can be confirmed for the area above, disease management would be difficult and would need an integrated approach.
