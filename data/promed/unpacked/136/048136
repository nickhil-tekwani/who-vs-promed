More than 200 villagers have fallen ill with symptoms of dengue, chikungunya and rat fever at Jambukarankottai in Dharmapuri district since Saturday [21 Jun 2014].

Dharmapuri MP Dr Anbumani Ramadoss rushed to the spot on Sunday morning [22 Jun 2014] with a team of doctors from the district health department. Anbumani also took part in the medical camp and gave treatment to the patients.

"More than 200 people at Jambukarankottai are suffering from dengue, chikungunya, and rat fever. We have confirmed this by testing blood samples of [febrile patients]," Anbumani told TOI.

He said rat fever or leptospirosis would attack people just before the onset of the monsoon. "The zoonotic disease is caused largely by rats that are natural carriers of the disease-causing bacterium [_Leptospira interrogans_]. Human beings contract the disease through water and soil which [is contaminated by] the urine of infected animals," he said.

"People those who are affected with rat fever will have symptoms like high fever, headache, chills and nausea. More than 40 people with serious health conditions were rushed to Dharmapuri Government Medical College Hospital," Anbumani said.

"Leptospirosis or rat fever is a potentially serious bacterial infection that can affect many parts of the body. It is caused by _Leptospira interrogans_, a corkscrew-shaped bacterium. Since rats are the most common source of human infection by the bacteria, the disease is also called rat fever. It does not spread from person to person," said a medical officer who is part of the medical team.

Leptospirosis bacteria can enter the body through wounds and mucous membranes, or when a person swallows contaminated food or water. Symptoms usually begin 10 days after infection. In severe cases, it can result in liver damage, jaundice, kidney failure, and internal bleeding.

Leptospirosis should be treated with antibiotics. "The disease can lead to life-threatening complications like renal failure, hypotension, and hemorrhage. Severe or untreated leptospirosis can lead to damage of the organs and, in rare cases, even death," he added.

[Jambukarankottai is a village in the Dharmapuri district located in the northwestern portion of Tamil Nadu, India (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharmapuri). Tamil Nadu, one of the 29 states of India, is located in the southernmost part of the Indian Peninsula (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu).

Leptospirosis occurs worldwide and outbreaks frequently follow flooding after heavy rains. _Leptospira_ survive for weeks to months in warm, fresh water, or soil flooded with fresh water. After exposure to floodwater contaminated by infected animal urine, the bacteria can enter the body through skin or mucous membranes, especially if the skin is broken from a cut or scratch. Drinking contaminated water or food can also cause infection.

Tamil Nadu experiences heavy rain during the South West monsoon starting in June to September and during the North East monsoon from October to December; the dry season is from January to May. (The news report above confusingly says, "leptospirosis would attack people just before the onset of the monsoon.")

Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of leptospirosis, its diagnosis cannot be made confidently without laboratory confirmation and the exact number of patients with leptospirosis is not given in the news report above. However, the news report above says that the diagnosis of leptospirosis has been confirmed in these patients by blood testing. - Mod.ML]

[Chikungunya & dengue have been reported from India for decades -- CHIKV/DENV coinfections were 1st reported in India in 1967 (Myers RM, Carey DE. Concurrent isolation from patient of two arboviruses, chikungunya and dengue type 2. Science. 1967;157(3794):1307-8. - Mod.JW
