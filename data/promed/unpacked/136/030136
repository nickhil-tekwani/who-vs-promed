The epidemiologic report on the Florida investigation is now posted
on the Emerging Infectious Diseases website.
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol8no10/02-0354.htm>
It has a lot of information on the environmental testing performed
last fall but unfortunately may not shed very much light on the
discussion about aerosolized spores.
