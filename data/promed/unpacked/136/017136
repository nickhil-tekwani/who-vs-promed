It depends on the circumstances, of course, but the number of wild animals
reported testing positive for rabies in various counties should probably
not be used for comparative purposes. Rabies testing is expensive and to a
certain extent messy, so once rabies is determined to be endemic there is
little incentive to make a diagnosis unless human exposure has occurred. In
other words, what may appear, statistically, to be a drop-off in infection,
often reflects only a reduction in testing.

[The alternative side is to report wildlife in order to: 1)gauge the amount
of rabies in the wildlife population, 2) make recommendations regarding
oral rabies vaccine for wildlife, 3)establish quarantine areas, 4) increase
funding for public awareness and education and 5) understand the pattern of
which animals are constituting the domestic animal exposure. - Mod.TG
