[This notification officially confirms the occurrence of HPAI H5N8 in South Korea (see ProMED-mail archive numbers 20140119.2183768 and 20140120.2191161). The apparent morbidity and mortality rate for this outbreak are reported as 0.05 percent and 0.03 percent respectively. Given that the affected population is a flock of ducks, it is not surprising that the mortality and morbidity rates are low. Waterfowl, such as ducks, are known reservoirs for the avian influenza virus, and as such, clinical signs of the disease in these birds are often non-existent or mild.

In certain host species, such as Peking ducks, some HPAI viruses do not necessarily provoke significant clinical disease (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.04_AI.pdf).

Between 2010 and 2011 South Korea reported 58 outbreaks of HPAI H5N1. These outbreaks occurred in the provinces of Jeollabuk-do (North Jeolla), Jeollanam-do (South Jeolla), Gyeonggi-do, Gyeongsangnuk-do, and Gyeongsangbuk-do (North Gyeongsang). During that period the disease affected domestic birds and wild avian species. The affected population during this period (2010-2011) was as follows: susceptible birds 1 436 019, cases 39 671, deaths 39 591, destroyed 1 396 376. The event was resolved on 26 May 2011 (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/Immsummary). - Mod.CRD
