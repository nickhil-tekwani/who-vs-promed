---------------------------------------------------
The incidence of botulism in cattle is very rare in India. This can be attributed to low or almost no feeding of silage and feeds from animal origin like carcases, meat, poultry litter, fish or meat meal. Mass death of animals similar to the one that is described is very rare. Hence no vaccine is available for this condition in India.

[The above firsthand information from Dr Panduranga Rao is gratefully acknowledged.

It would be interesting to note the source of the botulism toxin that caused the described outbreak in cattle and the identity of the type involved. - Mod.AS
