Veterinary services called farmers in the region to take all measures to prevent the spread of FMD
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After the appearance in May [2014] of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreaks in Tunisia and several suspected cases in Algeria [see comment], a new case was discovered in the town of Bir El Arch, in the wilaya [province] of Setif where 75 cattle were decimated by this epidemic.

According to the announcement of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development published on Sunday [27 Jul 2014], the outbreak involves "a set of cattle breeders and horse dealers who keep exclusively fattening cattle. 75 head were destroyed and buried." According to the Director of Veterinary Services in the Ministry, Karim Boughanem, all measures to deal with this epidemic have been applied, including quarantine, animal movement restrictions, ring vaccination around the outbreak, disinfection and closure of livestock markets.

According to the explanations of veterinarians, the owners of the infected animals in Satif have concealed the disease.

It should be emphasized that FMD has not been present in Algeria since 1999, prevented by regular vaccination campaigns. The current outbreak was identified following the illegal introduction of cattle from Tunisia, infecting local cattle.

According to Dr Boughanem, the veterinary services have been on high alert to protect the region's cattle population. The affected area of about 20 sq km [about 7.7 sq miles] includes a high concentration of cattle, in particular fattening/feeder cattle.

The introduction of the disease means a serious situation with potentially grave economical implications. It can affect small ruminants as well. Dr Boughanem added: "Nevertheless, it is reassuring that we have a correct rate of immunization coverage, so even if the disease spreads, losses are expected to be limited." He reminded that 2 vaccination campaigns were conducted this year [2014], involving nearly 1.6 million heads out of the total national cattle population of around 1.8 million.

Another preventive vaccination campaign was launched in May [2014], just after the disease was reported, in April [2014], in Tunisia. Since then, some 750 000 cattle have been inoculated.

To stop the spread of this highly contagious disease and prevent mortality in animals, the ministry urged ranchers and farmers in the wilaya of Setif and neighboring wilayas, including Mila, Batna, Bordj Bou Arreridj, Constantine, Bouira, Jijel, Tizi Ouzou and Bejaia, to take several measures. This includes refraining from movement of animals except to the nearest slaughterhouse, not to attend cattle markets, avoiding the introduction of new animals into their farms and to systematically apply quicklime at the entrances to the premises, and to immediately report any suspected case.

Three outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) have been discovered in the wilaya [province] of Bejaia. To prevent spread, 18 head of cattle have been immediately slaughtered. This has been stated by the veterinary inspection of the wilaya.

The foci are located respectively in the rural areas Boulimat (Bejaia), Djebira (Boukhlifa) and Darguina. Many suspected cases were also reported in several other areas, particularly in the Valley Soummam and the districts Seddouk, Takrietz, Fenaia and Taourit-Ighil.

The incriminated cattle were introduced from El Eulma (Setif [province]) and sold since last Wednesday [23 Jul 2014], in some livestock markets, including that of Sidi Aich, 55 km [about 34 miles] west of Bejaia -- a "scene of frenetic activity" according to the Chief Veterinary Inspector, Mr. Imad Idress.

Animals infected with the virus were immediately slaughtered and their heads, feet and offal incinerated.

Severe control and prevention measures have been undertaken, including animal movement restrictions and the establishment of road posts at the borders of the province, including Kherrata, east, and Bouira to the west. An awareness campaign for breeders and other fellahin [agricultural workers] has been launched in order to encourage them to focus on health and hygiene measures in their animal holdings, and especially become aware about the symptoms of FMD.

[Most likely, the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) strain involved is similar to the FMDV-O strain circulating in Tunisia (and Libya). However, this is yet to be established. The serotyping has not been accomplished yet, according to Algeria's immediate OIE notification dated 27 Jul 2014, and is anticipated.

According to item [1] above, the current outbreak was preceded by "several suspected cases in Algeria." The earlier introduction of FMD from Tunisia into Algeria was suspected and discussed in earlier postings. Subscribers are reminded of RFI posting 20140527.2502455, dated 27 May 2014, which included the following text (derived from "Catholic Online", published 20 May 2014): "Livestock has been affected in the eastern part of Algeria."

In fact, according to information from an unofficial veterinary source, antibodies to FMDV were detected in asymptomatic non-vaccinated Algerian cattle since mid-May 2014 by the Central Veterinary Laboratory in Algiers. Other rumors from Algeria mentioned suspected clinical FMD cases since early June 2014.

During the 8th Joint Permanent Committee (JPC) meeting of the Animal Health Mediterranean Network (REMESA), held in Valetta, Malta, 27-28 Mar 2014, it was reported that Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia have been supplied with antibody detection ELISA kits (24 kits to Tunisia, 18 kits to Morocco, 15 kits to Algeria) according to their requests and surveillance programme in 2014, for a total of 25 000 samples. This should enable the performance of the required surveillance in the 3 Maghreb countries, including small ruminants. Clinical FMD signs are often missed in adult sheep; these animals have often been implicated as disseminators of the FMD virus, both between and within countries. - Mod.AS
