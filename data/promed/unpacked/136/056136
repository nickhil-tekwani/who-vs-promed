The total number of anthrax cases in humans in Orissa's Koraput
district since last month [May 2010] has risen to 18 with health
officials on Wednesday [9 Jun 2010] confirming 5 more victims in the
region.

"The latest infections have been detected in Semiliguda block,"
additional district medical officer Nabaghana Chaudhuri said over the
phone. The disease has attacked 3 people of Biliguda village and one
each at Parajakhandi and Bariguda villages. All of them developed the
illness [2 Jun 2010], he said.

Last month [May 2010], at least 13 people of 2 villages under
neighbouring Dasmantpur block were treated after they were found to
have the infection. "All these people got the anthrax virus after
eating rotten meat," he said.

"Those affected, including the latest 5 persons, are out of danger.
Medical teams are camping in the affected villages to prevent spread
of the disease," he said.

Koraput district, about 500 km [311 mi] from the state capital
Bhubaneswar, is not new to anthrax, a bacterial disease that mostly
affects animals and spreads to humans through consumption of
contaminated meat.
