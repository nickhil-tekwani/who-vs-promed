Eggs, poultry, and poultry products from domestic flocks can't be moved out of much of the Tri-Cities [Kennewick, Pasco, and Richland in Washington state] because of an emergency quarantine declared to limit the spread of the highly contagious avian flu.

The Washington State Department of Agriculture quarantine took immediate effect [Wed 7 Jan 2015] and covers about 20 miles [32 km] near 2 Benton County locations where backyard flocks of chickens, turkeys, ducks, and guinea fowl were found to have avian influenza.

The strain of influenza found in the Benton City birds -- H5N2 -- is the same as the one found earlier in a wild pintail duck in Whatcom County and in outbreaks in Canada.

[To date there has been no evidence of HPAI H5N2- or H5N8-related illness in humans] but it is deadly to birds so officials are trying to keep it from spreading to other flocks. The quarantine could be in effect for up to 8 months.

It's OK to buy eggs, chicken breasts, and other poultry products from the grocery store and take them home. But you're not allowed to get eggs and meat from someone else's backyard flock.

Avian flu has been found in 2 Benton County backyard flocks in the past 2 weeks and more than 700 birds have died or been euthanized.

This is the 1st time avian flu has been found in a backyard flock in Washington. No US commercial flocks have been affected.

The commercial industry has a robust avian influenza testing program, say officials. Inspectors perform weekly testing and health inspections at live bird markets in the state.

Officials say the biggest risk is that migratory wild waterfowl could spread the disease to other backyard flocks. [Indeed this may be a risk and looking at the migration pattern of certain birds from other parts of the world, this may well be the case. There has always been some risk of domestic birds coming into contact with wild birds. After all, flu flies, whether in migratory birds or on planes full of passengers in the case of human strains. - Mod.TG]

The quarantine prevents Tri-Citians from transporting any chickens, turkeys, waterfowl, pigeons, doves, and any other domestic fowl outside the area.

The prohibition also applies to pheasants, partridges, chukars, quail, and grouse. Those birds all are considered potential hosts for avian influenza.

"The idea is to try to limit the chance of greater exposure to avian influenza," said Hector Castro, the state Department of Agriculture's communications manager.

Eggs and living and dead poultry on properties within the quarantine area are not supposed to be moved to other properties within the quarantine area, and any vehicles, equipment, and clothing that come into contact with poultry must be disinfected before leaving any property within the quarantine zone, according the emergency rule. Items that can't be disinfected can't be transported.

The quarantine covers most of Richland, up to the border with the Hanford nuclear reservation, most of West Richland, and the Badger Canyon area, according to state documents. Kennewick west of Columbia Center Boulevard also is part of the quarantine area. The area extends south to Locust Grove Road and west over to about Clodius Road. The quarantine also extends over the Columbia River to include Franklin County south of Birch Road and west of Taylor Flats Road.

Exemptions from the quarantine are possible, Castro said. Businesses that can show their establishments have strong biosecurity measures in place to protect the health of their birds can get special permission to move eggs, poultry or poultry products.

A Benton City flock was the first to have sick and dying birds in the region. The birds had access to a pond visited by wild waterfowl, which have been known to carry avian influenza.

About 100 ducks from a Richland flock had visited the Benton City flock, said officials.

The birds in both flocks that had not already died were euthanized by officials Monday and Tuesday [5-6 Jan 2015] as part of an effort to control the spread of the disease. Some of them were already getting sick. Poultry that catch the disease usually die within 3 days.

No new cases of avian influenza had been found by Wednesday afternoon [7 Jan 2015] and the test results for another backyard flock living near the Benton City flock came back negative for avian influenza, Castro said.

Tests have confirmed that the Richland flock had avian influenza, Castro said. Officials are still waiting for the USDA to confirm the exact strain.

USDA officials will contact property owners within about 6 miles [about 10 km] of both sites to check to see if any other domestic birds have been infected. Those birds would be tested with owner permission. From poultry, a swab is taken from the inside of its beak. With waterfowl, feces are tested.

State officials used the area the USDA plans to check as the basis for the quarantine.

[While the strain is listed as being H5N2 the article further states they are waiting on confirmation of this. Washington has had 2 different strains of HPAI recently but according to the OIE recent posting on ProMED-mail 20150109.3082193, it has been confirmed as H5N2.
