This is my understanding of the situation to date.
April 1997: massive chicken die-off in mainland China in area that supplies
live chickens to Hong Kong.
May 1997: child dies of flu in Hong Kong; had contact with pet poultry at
school.
Aug.1997: virus isolated from the child confirmed as H5N1, previously only
known from birds. Surveillance intensified.
Nov.1997: 3 more cases (1 fatal) occur, soon confirmed as H5N1. Unrelated
to each other.
Dec.1997: Hong Kong health authority implements widespread public health
measures, recommends treatment with amantidine.
13 Dec.1997: confirmed cases have risen to 7 (2 fatal, 2 seriously ill, 1
recovering, 2 discharged) -- all unrelated (i.e. no transmission to family
members).

Notes
-----
This is unusually early for influenza A in humans in Hong Kong; the usual
flu season starts in February or March.
Several hospital staff who have been in contact with the patients have
developed flu symptoms, and are under treatment with amantidine.
Amantidine has not been particularly effective in treating H5 flu in poultry.
In the Hong Kong poultry market, people come into close contact with live
birds when buying them for food.
The search for H5N1 virus in chickens in Hong Kong has so far come up negative.
WHO has decided not to call for the production of a vaccine yet, since there
is still no proven case of human-to-human transmission.
However, seed stock for a vaccine is being produced.
Once it has been decided to go ahead with a vaccine, it will take several
months to produce sufficient stocks for distribution.
The present flu vaccine will not protect against the H5N1 strain.
The present flu vaccine contains killed virus.
A more effective, live, attenuated (weakened) vaccine could be produced
against H5N1; however, this might theoretically be passed back from
vaccinated humans to poultry and revert to a strain that could kill the birds.
Since January 1997 there have been 6 small outbreaks of H5 flu (N type not
given) on rural farms in Italy in chickens, ducks, quail, pigeons and Guinea
fowl.
