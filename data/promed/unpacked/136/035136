Authorities account for most imported Gambian rats
---------------------------------
Federal, state and local authorities tracking dispersal of a shipment of
Gambian rats imported from Africa in early April [2003] by a Texas pet
distributor have accounted for most of the rats. Some of the Gambian rats
ended up with an Illinois pet dealer believed to have sold prairie dogs
linked to a cluster of monkeypox illnesses in the Midwest. Health officials
suspect that one or more of the imported Gambian rats infected the prairie
dogs sold by the Illinois dealer.
Texas Department of Health officials said that of the 50 Gambian rats
imported in the early April shipment, 10 died en route to the Texas
distributor or shortly after arrival, one died later at the distributor's
premises, 5 were shipped to a pet store within Texas, 9 remain alive at the
distributor's premises, and from 18 to 25 of the rats were sent to an Iowa
distributor with 18 of those sent from Iowa to the Illinois dealer. Of the
5 sold to the pet store in Texas, one was sold to an individual.
Authorities said the animal and the owner are fine. The other 4 died.
Officials said it is not unusual for deaths to occur in wild animals
brought into captivity and that the deaths cannot be assumed to have been
caused by monkeypox. TDH officials are hopeful that testing of the live
Gambian rats remaining at the distributor's premises and of a dead Gambian
rat from the pet store that had been kept frozen may offer additional clues
in the ongoing multi-state investigation.
Texas officials also said that while the prairie dogs sold by the dealer in
Illinois are believed to have come from a Texas distributor, it is not the
same dealer who supplied the Gambian rats. They said it does not appear
that the prairie dogs and Gambian rats were ever in the same facility in
Texas. The prairie dogs were shipped directly to the Illinois dealer.
Authorities stressed that the investigation is continuing, including the
tracking of other animals imported with the Gambian rats.
Earlier today, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food
and Drug Administration issued a joint order prohibiting the import of
rodents from Africa and banning the distribution, sale, and transport of
prairie dogs and 6 species of African rodents within the United States.

Multistate Outbreak of Monkeypox --- Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin, 2003*
--------------------------------------------------
*[one more case has since been reported from New Jersey -- see section [3]
below. - Mod.JW]
CDC has received reports of patients with a febrile rash illness who had
close contact with pet prairie dogs and other animals. The Marshfield
Clinic, Marshfield, Wisconsin, identified a virus morphologically
consistent with a poxvirus by electron microscopy of skin lesion tissue
from a patient, lymph node tissue from the patient's pet prairie dog, and
isolates of virus from culture of these tissues. Additional laboratory
testing at CDC indicated that the causative agent is Monkeypox virus, a
member of the _Orthopoxvirus_ [genus of the family _Poxviridae_]. This
report summarizes initial descriptive epidemiologic, clinical, and
laboratory data, interim infection-control guidance, and new animal import
regulations.
As of Tue 11 Jun 2003, a total of 53 cases had been investigated in
Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin. Of these, 29 (49 percent) cases were
among males; the median age was 26 years (range: 4 to 53 years). Data were
unavailable for sex and age for 2 and 14 patients, respectively. A total of
14 (26 percent) patients have been hospitalized, including a child aged <10
years with encephalitis.
Detailed clinical information was available for 30 cases reported in
Illinois and Wisconsin. Among these, the earliest reported onset of illness
was on 15 May 2003. For the majority of patients (22 [73 percent]), a
febrile illness has either preceded or accompanied the onset of a papular
rash; respiratory symptoms (16 [64 percent]), lymphadenopathy (14 [47
percent]), and sore throat (10 [33 percent]) also were prominent signs and
symptoms (Table). The rash typically progressed through stages of
vesiculation, pustulation, umbilication, and encrustation. Early lesions
became ulcerated in some patients. Rash distribution and lesions have
occurred on the head, trunk, and extremities; many patients had initial and
satellite lesions on palms, soles, and extremities. Rashes were generalized
in some patients.
All patients have had contact with animals; however, at least 2 patients
also reported contact with another patient's lesions or ocular drainage. A
total of 51 patients reported direct or close contact with prairie dogs
(Cynomys sp.), and one patient reported contact with a Gambian giant rat
(Cricetomys sp.). One patient had contact with a rabbit (family Leporidae)
that became ill after exposure to an ill prairie dog at a veterinary
clinic. Traceback investigations have been initiated to identify the source
of the monkeypox virus introduced into the United States and have
identified a common distributor where prairie dogs and Gambian giant rats
were housed together in Illinois. A search of imported animal records
revealed that Gambian giant rats were shipped from Ghana in April 2003 to a
wildlife importer in Texas and subsequently were sold to the Illinois
distributor. The shipment contained approximately 800 small mammals of 9
different species that might have been the actual source of introduction of
monkeypox.
As of Mon 9 Jun 2003, specimens obtained from 10 patients in Illinois,
Indiana, and Wisconsin had been forwarded to CDC for testing; 9 patients
with skin lesions had DNA sequence signatures specific for monkeypox virus.
No skin lesions were observed in one patient who tested negative by
polymerase chain reaction. Skin biopsies were available for 5 patients; 4
showed orthopoxviral antigens by immunohistochemical testing. Skin lesions
from four of the 10 patients were evaluated by negative stain electron
microscopy, and poxviral particles were found in 3 patients.
Monkeypox specific DNA signatures also were found in a viral isolate
derived from lymphoid tissue of a patient's ill prairie dog.

MMWR Editorial Note
---------------
In 1970, human monkeypox was first identified in the Democratic Republic of
the Congo (DRC) in a region where smallpox had been eradicated in 1968 (1).
Monkeypox is caused by an orthopoxvirus that clinically resembles smallpox
virus but differs both biologically and epidemiologically (2--5). After an
incubation period of 7 to 17 days, the disease is characterized by the
onset of a prodrome of fever, headache, backache, and fatigue. The
monkeypox rash includes macules, papules, vesicles, pustules, and crusts
that evolve in the same stage over 14 to 21 days, similar to smallpox (6).
A major clinical difference between monkeypox and smallpox is pronounced
lymphadenopathy in a majority of patients with monkeypox (6). Relatively
inefficient person-to-person transmission has been documented for
monkeypox, and the case-fatality rate has been approximately 1 to 10
percent in Africa, with higher death rates among young children (2,5,6).
Preliminary findings from these investigations indicate that the primary
route of transmission to humans is close contact with infected mammalian
pets. However, the possibility of human-to-human transmission cannot be
excluded. CDC has issued interim guidance for infection control, exposure
management, monitoring of exposed persons, and duration of isolation
procedures in health-care and community settings for patients with
suspected monkeypox:
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/monkeypox/infectioncontrol.htm>.
Persons seeking medical care with unexplained fever, rash, or prominent
lymphadenopathy should be asked about exposure to unusual or exotic pets,
especially small mammals such as prairie dogs or Gambian giant rats. If
monkeypox infection is suspected, standard, contact, and airborne
precautions should be applied in all health-care settings:
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/hip/ISOLAT/Isolat.htm>.
Interim guidance for veterinarians and pet owners also are available at:
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/monkeypox/animalguidance.htm>. These
recommendations are modeled after human infection-control guidelines, with
modifications appropriate for veterinary and home settings where airborne
precautions might not be feasible. In addition, these guidelines outline
the appropriate management of exposed or ill pets to help prevent further
transmission of monkeypox among animals.
Introduction of exotic species, such as rodents from Africa, poses a
serious public health threat because of the potential of monkeypox virus
infection and other nonindigenous pathogens. Serosurveys of various healthy
rodents (and nonhuman primates), including _Cricetomys emini_, captured
wild in Africa, have demonstrated orthopoxvirus antibodies (7). Monkeypox
virus also has been isolated from a rope squirrel (_Funisciurus
anerythrus_) found with skin lesions in the vicinity of monkeypox cases in
DRC (8). Accordingly, pursuant to 42 CFR 71.32(b), CDC is implementing an
immediate embargo on the importation of all rodents from Africa (order
Rodentia). In addition, CDC and the Food and Drug Administration, pursuant
to 42 CFR 70.2 and 21 CFR 1240.30, are prohibiting the transportation or
offering for transportation in interstate commerce, or the sale, offering
for sale, or offering for any other type of commercial or public
distribution, including release into the environment of prairie dogs and
the following rodents from Africa: tree squirrels (Heliosciurus sp.), rope
squirrels (Funisciurus sp.), dormice (Graphiurus sp.), Gambian giant
pouched rats (Cricetomys sp.), brush-tailed porcupines (Atherurus sp.), and
striped mice (Hybomys sp.). States can elect to enact measures to prohibit
the importation, sale, distribution, or display of animals that could
result in transmission of infectious agents (9,10).
Health-care providers, veterinarians, and public health officials who
suspect monkeypox in animals or humans should report such cases to their
state and local health departments. CDC requests that reports of suspect
cases from state health departments be directed to the CDC Emergency
Operations Center, telephone 770-488-7100. Additional information about
monkeypox, including an interim case definition, is available at:
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/monkeypox> &
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/monkeypox/casedefinition.htm>, respectively.

Wisconsin: Suspected case of human-to-human transmission of monkeypox
-------------------------------------------------
Health officials in Wisconsin said on Thu 12 Jun 2003 that a health care
worker may have contracted monkeypox from a human patient in what would be
the first known case of the disease spreading person-to-person in this
country. Wisconsin state epidemiologist Jeff Davis said monkeypox virus
hadn't yet been confirmed in the worker, but it was suspected and experts
were testing tissue specimens.
The announcement came a day after U.S. government moved aggressively to
contain the first outbreak of monkeypox in the Western Hemisphere by
prohibiting imports of African rodents, banning the sale of prairie dogs --
believed to have spread the virus to humans -- and recommending smallpox
shots for people exposed to monkeypox. The government also expanded its
search for infected prairie dogs to 15 states.
The smallpox vaccine can prevent monkeypox, an exotic African disease, up
to 2 weeks after exposure to the virus but is most effective in the first 4
days. "We're optimistic we can deliver the vaccine to these people in time
to do good," said Dr. David Fleming, the Center for Disease Control and
Prevention's deputy director for Public Health and Science.
As of Wed 11 Jun 2003, health officials had confirmed a total of 9 human
cases of the disease -- 4 in Wisconsin, 4 in Indiana, and one in Illinois.
54 possible cases had been reported -- 25 in Indiana, 17 in Wisconsin, 11
in Illinois, and one in New Jersey, CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said. No one
in the United States has died of the disease. Fleming said he is confident
the outbreak will be controlled.
"Monkeypox is a disease that is potentially transmissible from person to
person but at a fairly low level," he said. "I don't anticipate the same
kind of problem that we anticipate from SARS."
Fleming said the smallpox vaccine is 85 percent effective against
monkeypox. The smallpox vaccine is widely available because states stocked
up on it out of fear of bioterrorism. More than 37 000 health workers in
the United States have been vaccinated. The CDC said health care workers,
veterinarians, and family members who have cared for or had close contact
with infected people or animals should get vaccinations. The agency also
warned veterinarians and doctors to be on the lookout for the symptoms,
especially in owners of prairie dogs or exotic rodents from Africa.
About 40 out of every million people given the smallpox vaccine for the
first time will face a life-threatening injury, and one or 2 will die.
Still, the CDC is recommending vaccinations even for pregnant women,
children, and people with eczema -- for whom the vaccine is usually
discouraged -- who have been exposed to infected prairie dogs. "Because of
the real risk here ... we're recommending a somewhat aggressive approach of
who should get the vaccine," Fleming said.

The Centers for Disease Control posted the following information on their
Monkeypox webpage regarding the trading of prairie dogs at swap meets.
Information on Prairie Dogs with Monkeypox that May Have Been Traded at
Swap Meets
For Immediate Release
A joint investigation with state and local officials in Illinois, the USDA,
and CDC is currently in the process of conducting contact tracings from
Phil's Pocket Pets, Villa Park, Illinois, where prairie dogs infected with
monkeypox may have been sold to numerous buyers in 15 states, including IL,
IN, OH, KY, WI, TX, SC, FL, TN, PA, MS, MA, MI, NJ, NY, since 15 Apr 2003.
The Illinois Department of Health is in the process of notifying state
health officials in states that may have received animals from this dealer.
CDC is recommending that states contact these buyers and inquire about
recent illnesses in humans or animals in the 30 days after purchase.
The dealer also sold animals at 3 animal swap meets since 15 Apr 2003.
These included sales by Phil Mobley (Phil's Pocket Pets) at Lee Watson's
Reptile Show in Schaumburg IL on 20 Apr, 3 May, and 18 May 2003, the
Midwest reptile show in Indianapolis, IN on 27 Apr and [day missing] May,
and the All Ohio Reptile Show in Columbus, OH on 19 Apr 2003. In addition,
a dealer from Wisconsin, Scott Knapp of SK Exotics, sold 3 prairie dogs
acquired from this IL dealer, including one to an unidentified man, at a
swap meet in Wausau, WI in early to mid May 2003.
Records for swap meet sales are not required, and there is no way to
identify persons who acquired animals from these dealers at these swap
meets. In addition, people at swap meets often handle animals without
purchasing them. Therefore, broad circulation of this information is
desirable to facilitate identification of all possible human infections.
Persons who purchased ANY animal from one of these dealers are encouraged
to contact their state health department.
