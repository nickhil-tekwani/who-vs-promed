Brazil is once again reporting a substantial outbreak of yellow fever. On 6 Mar 2019, Brazil confirmed 50 human yellow fever cases, including 12 deaths. Bolivia has recorded one case and Peru has recorded 9 cases [see Yellow fever - Americas (04): PAHO/WHO, Bolivia, Brazil, Peru 20190307.6355499].

This is important news since more than 2.8 million Americans [USA] visit Brazil each year. Since early 2018, a number of unvaccinated travelers to Brazil contracted yellow fever; many of these travelers were infected on the island of Ilha Grande in the Rio de Janeiro State. Several of these infected travelers died.

As of 7 Mar 2019, the number of human cases reported during the current season is substantially lower than observed during the previous season. During the 2017-2018 yellow fever season, Brazil reported 1376 human cases, including 483 deaths.

In the current seasonal period (2018-2019), yellow fever cases have been reported in the states of Sao Paulo (46 cases) and Parana (4 cases). Among confirmed cases, 90% (45 of 50) are male and the median age is 43 years. All of the deaths occurred among confirmed cases in the state of Sao Paulo.

In the 2018-2019 seasonal period, most of the confirmed epizootics (90%) were reported in the southeast region of the country, which means there is a possibility of yellow fever reaching bordering countries, such as Argentina and Paraguay [as happened in 2008 and 2009; see archives below].

The yellow fever illness ranges from a fever with aches and pains to severe liver disease, with bleeding and yellowing skin. There is no medicine to treat or cure a yellow fever infection.

In response to Brazil's yellow fever outbreak, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Level 2 Travel Alert during May 2018 recommending visitors to Brazil protect themselves by getting the vaccination at least 10 days before departure to Brazil [Alert Level 2, Practice Enhanced Precautions].

Yellow fever is a disease caused by a virus that is spread through mosquito bites. International travelers can find convenient locations to schedule a vaccination appointment by visiting Vax-Before-Travel. In the USA, the Stamaril vaccine is approved and has a clinical efficacy profile similar to the YF-VAX vaccine, and is available at select locations.

The CDC Vaccine Price List provides private sector vaccine prices for general information, and vaccine discounts can be found on this webpage (https://www.precisionvaccinations.com/discounts).

Vaccines, like any medicine, can have side effects. You are encouraged to report negative side effects of vaccines to the CDC.

[Although the CDC Level 2 Travel Alert was issued in 2018, at the peak of the yellow fever (YF) outbreak in Brazil, it is prudent to be vaccinated this year (2019) as well, not only for travel to Brazil but for other countries in tropical South America where the virus is endemic. All the human cases last year (2018) and this year (2019) were acquired from spillover of the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle and not from urban human -- _Aedes aegypti_ -- human transmission cycle. Some YF infections were acquired in forest parks near urban centers such as municipal Sao Paulo. Should cases occur again in humans or non-human primates in these types of forest settings, visitors should be vaccinated.
