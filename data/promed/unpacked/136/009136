State agriculture officials said they will remove from the farm of a
local veterinarian a horse that may be infected with the potentially
dangerous equine infectious anemia [EIA].

The Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources last month
[August 2010] ordered the veterinarian to transfer Nora, a miniature
horse, to a research facility licensed by the federal Department of
Agriculture over concerns that the animal has the EIA disease.

State authorities said they would remove and euthanize the horse if
the veterinarian did not comply.

The state had issued the order to remove the animal by 26 Aug 2010
but officials extended the deadline until 5 p.m. yesterday [31 Aug
2010]. Catherine Williams, a spokesman for the Department of
Agricultural Resources, said last night that the veterinarian did not
comply by the latest deadline. She said state officials will now
seize the mare, although she added she didn't know when that action
will be taken.

Ms Williams noted that, since the deadline extension, officials have
been in contact with the veterinarian through his legal counsel.

This doctor owns a number of miniature horses on his 200-acre [81 ha]
property. He has maintained that, though the horse has been exposed
to EIA, the animal showed no signs of the disease after being tested twice.

The veterinarian said Nora may carry protective antibodies to EIA and
should be allowed to live because she is valuable to biomedical
research. He could not be reached for comment last night.

[There are a couple of key issues here: the horse has not been proven
to have the disease, as the article says "may" have the disease.
Therefore, what right does the state have to seize an animal if they
are not certain the animal has the disease? If the animal is proven
to have the disease, why can the owner not self quarantine? Most
states allow such quarantine, provided no animals leave the property.
Why is the state of Massachusetts appearing to be unreasonable here?
If some one from the state veterinarian's office would care to
respond, we would appreciate it. - Mod.TG]

A Fellsmere woman used an elaborate ruse to cover up her horse's rare
communicable disease that, left unchecked, potentially could have
spread through Florida's horse industry, a state Department of
Agriculture spokesman said Wednesday [1 Sep 2010].

The woman was arrested Tuesday [31 Aug 2010] on a charge of willfully
violating a state law that required reporting that her horse, Dolly,
had equine infectious anemia -- an incurable virus that causes fever,
anemia, and occasionally death, state spokesman Terry McElroy said.

State tests have confirmed the woman's other horse also has the
disease, which is usually spread by flies biting one infected horse
and carrying the blood to another, McElroy said. Both horses were
taken from the woman and her husband's ranch and are in a
state-approved quarantine facility in South Florida.

Eventually, the woman will have to decide whether to keep the horses
in her own quarantine or put them to death -- an alternative court
documents say she was trying to avoid by giving a false name,
addresses, and phone numbers.

The real estate agent even used a co-worker's e-mail account in Palm
Bay to disguise herself, arrest records show. That's because,
according to court documents, the owner's 5-year-old granddaughter
wanted to ride Dolly, a 28-year-old mare, in competition. [The
granddaughter never did ride the horse in competition], McElroy said.

It is the 1st known criminal case of its type in recent history in a
state that has an estimated 500 000 horses. About 140 000 Florida
horses are tested annually for the disease. Usually, at the most, one
horse has the virus, McElroy said.

State agricultural officials began tracking down the owner after she
-- using her maiden name -- had East Coast Equine veterinarian clinic
in Vero Beach take a blood sample on 24 Jun 2010 because she
suspected her horse had the virus.

On 14 Jul 2010 a state lab in Kissimmee [Florida] confirmed the illness.

Then state veterinarian John Crews found the owner's name, address,
and phone number given to East Coast Equine were wrong. Department of
Agriculture workers unsuccessfully checked property and driver's
license records and asked around the Fellsmere community.

Finally the agency assigned one of its detectives, who found an
e-mail address given to East Coast Equine belonged to one of the
owner's co-workers in Palm Bay. The detective tracked her down at her
ranch in late July [2010] and was told "she used the alias in order
to buy time for Dolly since she believed that the horse would be
euthanized," according to the detective's record in court files.

The horse's owner is out of the Indian River County Jail under a USD
7500 bail. Her next scheduled court appearance is 9 a.m. 20 Oct 2010
in Indian River Circuit Court.

[It is apparent from both of these articles how much the owners of
these animals love them. They both fear the death of their animals.
There should be other options available to these people other than euthanasia.

While state officials are charged with enforcing the law, behaviors
such as these may indicate that state regulatory authorities are not
doing a good job at educating the public regarding the disease, the
clinical effects on the animal, or options other than euthanasia.

The United States Department of Agriculture has thoughtfully provided
educational material to owners, to state authorities, and to all of
us. There is an educational brochure on EIA at the USDA Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service page at
<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/animal_diseases/eia/downloads/eia-1996.pdf>.
Information regarding additional resources may be found on
ProMED-mail posting 20100415.1226.

Equine infectious anemia (EIA) affects Equidae and is caused by an
equid-specific lentivirus in the retrovirus family, equine infectious
anemia virus (EIAV). Although the majority of persistent infections
appear to have minimal clinical consequences, EIA may be seen in
epizootic form with high morbidity and mortality. Infection can be
accurately diagnosed with laboratory tests. Because there are no
effective and safe vaccines, many countries have established control
programs based on serologic testing.

EIA is a blood borne infection; virus can be found free in the plasma
or cell-associated. Infection with EIAV appears to persist for life
and, in nature, blood-feeding insects initiate most infections by
mechanical transfer of infective blood between horses in close
proximity. Tabanids, horseflies, and deer flies appear to be the most
efficient vectors because the pain of their bite initiates host
defensive behavior that interrupts feeding and results in additional
host-seeking behavior. As EIAV has not been shown to multiply in
insects, infected equids appear to be the only reservoir of the
virus. Iatrogenic transmission has a high epizootic potential that
can be avoided by standard precautions, such as, disposal or
decontamination of needles and equipment between horses.

Exposed equids generally support viral replication for days to weeks
before antibodies to EIAV can be detected. The incubation period
ranges from 10 to 45 days or more, usually lasting 21-42 days after
natural transmission. Peak viremia often occurs during a febrile
episode before the horse becomes test-positive. These acute signs
often go unrecognized in horses on pasture and may be accompanied by
a mild reduction in platelet counts and transient inappetence. Often,
infection is noted only after routine surveillance testing for EIA or
when the horse develops recurring clinical bouts of fever accompanied
by marked platelet reductions, petechial hemorrhages, anemia,
depression, weight loss, cachexia, and dependent edema (hallmarks of
the chronic form of EIA). EIAV infection can therefore present as an
inapparent infection or as an acute or chronic disease. The clinical
manifestations are determined in part by the viral strain and dose,
and the genetic makeup and status of the immune system of the equid.
For example, strains of EIAV adapted by rapid serial passage in
horses can kill horses within 14 days of infection but may have no
clinical effect on donkeys. Likewise, strains that produce no or mild
clinical disease in adults have killed immunologically immature
fetuses or immunodeficient foals. Frequently, EIAV enters a herd and
is transmitted silently until the chronic form of the disease is
noted. By that time, a high percentage of the herd can be infected.

Clinical diagnosis should be confirmed by serology. The agar gel
immunodiffusion (AGID, Coggins) test is internationally accepted;
antigen sources include cell culture-propagated virus and recombinant
proteins. ELISA tests for detection of antibody against EIAV antigens
are accepted in many countries and aid in the practical diagnosis of
EIAV infection. The ELISA tests can be done in minutes (compared with
1-2 days for AGID test results) and used under field conditions. In
all cases, positive ELISA tests should be confirmed by AGID before
regulatory actions are taken because of the higher rate of false
positive results. When combined, ELISA and AGID testing afford the
highest level of sensitivity and specificity.

No specific treatment or vaccine is available. As EIAV-infected
equids present the only known source of infection, antibody-positive
animals should be kept at a safe distance (around 200 m) from other
equids. The only recognized exception to this rule is the progeny of
test-positive mares, which may possess maternal antibodies to EIAV.
In the majority of cases, passive antibody against EIAV wanes to
negative on AGID tests by 6-8 months of age.

The risk associated with maintaining EIAV-infected breeding stock
varies. Field studies have indicated excellent success in raising
test-negative foals from inapparent carriers of EIAV. The risks of
infection in utero increase dramatically if clinical signs of EIA are
seen in the mare prior to parturition. Unfortunately, it is not
possible to accurately determine the risk posed by any EIAV-infected
equid. As EIAV persists in each infected equid for life, most
regulatory agencies assume all EIAV-positive equids pose the same high risk.

Most states have some type of regulatory program as well as
surveillance requiring testing prior to changing ownership.
