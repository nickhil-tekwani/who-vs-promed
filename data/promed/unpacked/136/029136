Trichomoniasis is a VERY common disease in pigeons and doves, but raptors,
canaries, finches and budgerigar can also host the protozoa. Clean
lofts/aviariums, if they are companion birds, is the best solution.
Dimetridazole and like molecules will take care of the parasite.

I have also seen trichomoniasis in Great Horned Owls. It may also be
transmitted between pigeons during ritualized courtship feeding in which
the female places her beak in the male's mouth. Affected birds often
display respiratory distress and open-mouthed breathing. Trichomoniasis is
treatable with several drugs such as Emtryl.

Trichomoniasis is a common finding not only in pigeons and doves, but also
in the birds of prey that may feed upon them. From anecdotal reports, it
is interesting to note that the parasite appears more pathogenic in the
western portion of the country than in the east, especially in birds of
prey. This may be due to strain variations in the parasite or in evolved
resistance in host defenses. Hanson (1969) pointed out that pigeons (and
_Trichomonas_) were introduced to the eastern part of the continent roughly
2 centuries before their introduction to the west coast, and speculated
that this parasite may have contributed significantly to the extinction of
the passenger pigeon.

A few interesting references are appended.
