The global amphibian trade spread the lethal chytrid fungus, which is
decimating frogs around the planet, and it now looks like it may have
created the disease in the 1st place.

The team behind this finding are calling for an amphibian quarantine
to help slow the disease's spread.

Rhys Farrer of Imperial College London and colleagues sequenced the
genomes of 20 samples of the offending fungus, _Batrachochytrium
dendrobatidis_ (_Bd_), collected in Europe, Africa, North and South
America, and Australia.

They found that 16 of the 20 samples were genetically identical,
belonging to a single strain called BdGPL that had spread to all 5
continents. Tests on tadpoles also revealed that the strain was
extremely virulent.

BdGPL's genome showed that it had formed when 2 strains mated, some
time in the past 100 years. The best and simplest explanation is that
20th-century trade, which shipped amphibians all over the world,
enabled the mating, says Farrer's supervisor Matthew Fisher.

"We have got to restrict trade, or at least make sure that amphibians
are not contaminated," says Fisher. One approach would be for
countries to quarantine all imported amphibians and only allow them to
stay if they are uninfected.

When it emerged that trade was spreading chytrid, the World
Organisation for Animal Health made the disease notifiable, meaning
that countries must report whether they have it or not. But that
doesn't stop it spreading.

The 2 places in most urgent need of protection are Madagascar and
south-east Asia, says Fisher: "They're the last redoubts of uninfected
amphibian species." Both are hotspots of amphibian diversity, and are
clear of BdGPL. Madagascar remains uninfected despite rampant BdGPL in
Africa, and a recent survey shows that Asian chytrid strains are not
very virulent (PLoS One, DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0023179).

If BdGPL reaches these places, it could quickly devastate their frogs.
Within months of it reaching Montserrat, in the West Indies, in early
2009, conservationists had to fly giant ditch frogs -- also known as
mountain chickens -- out of the country to save them from extinction.

Countries that already have BdGPL should also institute quarantine,
says Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance in New York. "This
research shows that recombination can occur and give rise to new
virulent strains," he says. "Blocking introduction of new strains will
cut down on this."

Daszak adds: "It will be hard to stop the spread of new lineages of
Bd, but if we look at the devastation that this pathogen has already
caused, we desperately need to try."

[Chytrid fungus has had a devastating effect on frogs for more than a
decade. It is both sad and somewhat ironic that the very groups who
are so passionate about these creatures as to trade them from their
natural habitat may have been the perpetrators of the situation.

If this is true, then it is a huge warning. Hopefully those in the
amphibian trade and other regulatory agencies will take action. -
