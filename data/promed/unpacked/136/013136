New Jersey issues cautions against tick paralysis
-------------------------------------------------
2 cases of tick paralysis in South Jersey have prompted state health
officials to warn residents to take precautions to avoid tick bites. Tick
paralysis is rare in this part of the country, health commissioner Clifton
Lacy said, but the illness can be life-threatening unless the tick is
removed. Tick paralysis is characterized by weakness and malaise. Symptoms
usually show up about 5 days after a tick bite.
A 5 year old girl in Burlington County suffered slurred speech and leg
muscle weakness after a tick bite in May 2003. A 7 year old girl in Camden
County had a hoarse voice and weak legs last week. Both children recovered
18 to 36 hours after ticks were removed, said state epidemiologist Eddy
Bresnitz.
"These 2 cases highlight the importance of regular tick checks and prompt
removal of attached ticks," Bresnitz said. "By taking proper preventive
measures, people can reduce their risk of all tickborne diseases." Lacy
urged residents to wear long clothes when in wooded areas, use insect
repellent, and examine clothing, skin, and scalp for ticks after exposure
to tick habitats.

[Tick paralysis presents primarily with gait instability, progressing to an
ascending flaccid paralysis, which can lead to respiratory muscle paralysis
and death. Cerebellar ataxia may also be a prominent feature. It is a
toxicosis due to a toxin elaborated by the continued and prolonged feeding
of a gravid female tick. The disease can affect both humans and animals.
The differential diagnosis includes Guillain-Barre syndrome, botulism, and
myaesthenia gravis.
It is especially well described in Australia, where the tick involved is
_Ixodes holocyclous_ and the Rocky Mountain and western areas of the USA
and Canada, where the tick involved is the wood tick, _Dermacentor
andersoni_. Relevent to this posting, it has also been described in several
USA south eastern states including Virginia and Georgia, where the vector
is usually _D. variabilis_ (the dog tick) or _Amblyomma americanum_ (the
lone star tick). Accurate statistics in the USA are difficult to obtain
since the disease is not reportable. Although no cases have been known to
have occurred in New Jersey, tick paralysis has been reported in a 2 year
old child in Poughkeepsie, New York (1) and may well occur rarely in almost
every state. Because of its rarity in most of the USA, this alert should
help in reminding clinicians of disease.
The treatment is removal of the tick, after which the neurological signs
resolve within hours (2). This seems to be the case with New World cases
related to _Dermacentor_ species but in Australia, the ascending paralysis
may be slower in onset and may not peak until 48 hours following tick
removal. Recovery is likewise slower and a number of weeks may go by before
complete recovery occurs (3).
