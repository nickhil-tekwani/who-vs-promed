LEPTOSPIROSIS, DOGS - USA (NEW YORK)
************************************
A ProMED-mail post
Date: Wed. Nov. 12, 1997
From: Peter Cowen <Peter_Cowen@ncsu.edu>

Reports from veterinarians in New York investigating an unusually high
number of canine renal/hepatic syndrome cases indicate an increased
frequency of _L. grippotyphosa_, a not uncommonly found serovar in domestic
animal species. Reports from Long Island Veterinary Medical Society,
indicate approximately 200 cases over the past 15 months. During this
period there were approximately 200,000 sick visits to veterinarians
practicing on Long Island. This strain is rarely found in humans, but
zoonotic potential does exist. The Cornell University Veterinary
Diagnostic Laboratory has confirmed the diagnosis.
The current wisdom is that this is from perhaps an epidemic cycling in
wildlife that is spilling over into the dog populations in contact with the
typical leptospirosis fomites, i.e., urine-contaminated water, soils, mud,
etc.
The Long Island Veterinary Medical Society has summarized this "outbreak"
which is continuing and perhaps spreading down the eastern USA coast; no
human cases documented so far. The pertinent Departments of Health,
including the NYS DOH, have all been informed and kept up to date.

this outbreak in dogs. - Mod.PC]
