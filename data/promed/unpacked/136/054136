An outbreak of foulbrood disease has killed 40 percent of the Western Cape's bee population this year [2015], threatening SA's Rand 20-billion [about USD 1.66 billion] industry [of pollination, honey, and beeswax]. Albert Einstein is erroneously quoted as saying, "If the bee disappeared off the surface of the globe, then man would only have 4 years of life left." Although nobody knows who said it first, it does indicate the importance of the black-and-yellow insect.

Bees are a critical part of our food cycle but a disease is wiping out entire colonies and hives in key areas in South Africa. "We are somewhere between a crisis and a catastrophe," says Mike Allsopp of the Agricultural Research Council. He has been warning of a collapse of African bees for the past 2 decades and is an outspoken proponent of bees being given more attention.

"Bees are more important than any other domesticated animal because they are indispensable when it comes to our food security."

But, he says, nobody listened and followed through with action because the population had historically survived any disease that came ashore. "We have been cursed by our own success."

Because the African bee is hardier than any other bee species, local beekeepers became complacent and responses to any outbreak were left without planning, he says.

The problem is a bacterium that causes American foulbrood disease, and an outbreak has killed off 40 percent of the bees in the Western Cape this year [2015]. The bacteria are ingested by larvae in bee colonies. These grow until they kill their hosts, leaving a corpse with more than 100-million infected spores. Other bees then get infected when they come to clean the hive and spread the bacterium, which can survive for half a century and only fire kills it.

The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations says the bacterium has been around for a century and plagues bee colonies in much of the world. Without bees, farmers cannot fertilise their crops cheaply and in an environmentally friendly way. 2/3 of the world's food crops rely on bees for fertilisation, it says.

The common practice among big producers, such as the United States, is to treat infected colonies with antibiotics. This keeps the bees productive and kills off the immediate outbreak of foulbrood, the FAO says.

But this presents the South African bee industry with a dilemma. Several local beekeepers say there is a split between those who want to use antibiotics because they have to meet large orders to fertilise farms and those who are worried about the dangers of antibiotics.

Professor Theresa Wossler, a behavioural ecologist at the University of Stellenbosch, says nobody was prepared for an outbreak because the African bee is so hardy. The outbreak was a shock for the industry and it is scrambling to find a solution, she says.

The commercial use of antibiotics is being adopted, but this only temporarily solves the problem, she says. "If we do like other countries have done and use antibiotics, we will mask its clinical symptoms and create drug resistance."

The best solution is to find a colony of bees that have survived the disease and to use their resistance to save the local species. But this takes time and a great deal of luck, she says.

Other beekeepers have lost more than half their bees, making it hard for them to meet orders. David Malan, of the South African National Seed Organisation, says that although the disease is currently isolated to one province, it threatens the whole country's food production. "If we do not have bees to fertilise -- and here we are seeing a clear threat to their population -- we are facing a serious crisis."

The growing industry means there is an ever-increasing need for bees and, without this, it would be hard to produce enough to feed people, he says. "We need an urgent response otherwise we are going to have our backs against the wall."

That response should be coming from the department of agriculture, forestry and fisheries. Bees fall under its inspector services. But 2 different sources say the department does not have any inspectors overseeing beekeepers.

"We have the usual South African problem of great legislation but no implementation, and no consequences for people who ignore the legislation," says one.

The department did not respond to questions before publication. But it has released press statements about the effect of foulbrood, saying it would greatly increase the cost of pollination and consequently the price of staple foods. It was waiting for the National Beekeeper Conference in May to evaluate the extent of the problem, and would work with the industry on solutions, it said.

American foulbrood (AFB) is an infectious disease of the larval stage of the honeybee _Apis mellifera_ and other _Apis_ spp., and occurs throughout the world where such bees are kept. _Paenibacillus larvae_, the causative organism, is a Gram positive bacterium that can produce over one billion spores in each infected larva. The bacterium is a round-ended, straight and sometimes curved rod, which varies greatly in size (0.5 microns wide by 1.5 to 6 microns long), occurring singly and in chains and filaments; some strains are motile. The sporangia are often sparse in vitro, and the ellipsoidal, central to subterminal spores, which may swell the sporangia, are often found free. The spores are extremely heat stable and resistant to chemical agents. Only spores are capable of inducing the disease.

For more information, please see the OIE terrestrial manual, Chapter 2.2.2 on AFB at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.02.02_AMERICAN_FOULBROOD.pdf.

For additional information, please refer to Mod.CRD's commentary in posting 20130930.1976297.

According to South Africa's 'Animal health situation' report to the OIE (updated for 2014), 'American foulbrood of honey bees' is a notifiable disease, which was 'suspected (not confirmed)'. A confirmation or otherwise of this media reported spread of AFB in the Western Cape province and -- in case confirmed -- its official notification, are anticipated. - Mod.AS]
