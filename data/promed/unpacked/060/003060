TUBERCULOSIS IN BUFFALO - SOUTH AFRICA

Bovine tuberculosis (_Mycobacterium bovis_) has infected over half of
the buffalo herds in Kruger National Park in South Africa, concentrated in
the south part of this 2 million hectare park. The original source of the
infection may have been a 1960's outbreak on a cattle farm in the
southwest corner of the park. The Park was unfenced at that time
which allowed the buffalo access to the infected cattle through farm
fences.
The TB was detected in 1990 when a young buffalo was shot due to
illness. The autopsy showed the TB. Since then, surveys done during
the annual cull have shown very high infection rates, up to 85% in one
herd. A small number of animals of other species have also been found
infected: 3 lions, 6 kudu, 2 cheetah and a baboon troop.
A study group has been set up to develop a strategies for control. One
plan was to establish a buffalo-free zone to separate the uninfected
herds in the north from infected herds in the south of the Park. Then the
infected animals south of the zone would be slaughtered. This plan was
dropped when TB was also discovered in the north part of the Park. At
this time, Park officials are trying to contain the disease within the Park
through fencing. They are especially concerned with the infection
spreading to valuable export species such as white rhinoceros. [I hope
they are talking about zoological park use - Mod.MDM]
Park veterinarians are searching for better methods to diagnose TB in the
various species. At this time, they can only test bovids and primates
without resorting to autopsy.
Until more research is done, Park officials will have to rely on monitoring
to follow the disease. There appears to be little spread into other
species. Most of the infected buffalo appear perfectly healthy. It is
unknown whether the disease will have any adverse affect on the
buffalo populations.
[This situation reminds me of current problems with _M. bovis_ in captive
herds of deer in the United States. The animals appear healthy and the
disease is not discovered until slaughter or autopsy.

_M. bovis_ has been almost completely eradicated from US cattle herds
except for a few herds in Texas and California. Animal health officials
are very concerned about the escape of TB from the infected deer herds into
the wild deer populations - Mod.MDM]
