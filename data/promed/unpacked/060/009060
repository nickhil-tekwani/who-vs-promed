Japanese encephalitis, a viral disease, continues to affect locals in
Uttar Pradesh's Gorakhpur District. More than 700 patients have been
admitted to the city's Baba Raghav Das Medical College [Hospital]
since January [2011]. The disease has claimed 107 lives, including
children, and left many affected.

According to media reports, more than 7000 people have died of
encephalitis in the last 32 years at the Gorakhpur Medical College
Hospital. "Around 40 to 50 patients get admitted (in medical college)
daily, and out of which 4 - 5 children lose their lives everyday,"
said Balwant Kumar, a family member of another patient.

Meanwhile, the state health department has reportedly taken preventive
measures such as immunization drives, fogging and spraying of
mosquito-repellents in affected areas.

Encephalitis is caused by [virus transmitted by] mosquitoes that breed
in stagnant water. Its symptoms include headache, fever, confusion,
drowsiness, and fatigue and the inflammation of the brain.
