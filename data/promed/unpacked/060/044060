After Panchmahal, the rare Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) is keeping district health officials on their toes in Anand district too. Another 3 cases of GBS have been reported from Nishraya village of Anand's Borsad taluka. Earlier, this week, more than a dozen cases of the rare syndrome were reported from the Panchmahal district. "All the 3 patients are from Nishraya village but not from the same locality or pocket," said Anand's chief district health officer Dr Mahendra Chhari.

While 2 of these patients are admitted at Shree Krishna Hospital at Karamsad, another patient has been referred to GMERS Medical College and Hospital, Gotri at Vadodara. "The cases have surfaced in a week's time. After the cases surfaced, we carried out surveillance in the area and we have not come across any other case," he said.

In GBS, the immune system attacks the peripheral nervous system of the body. It can be triggered by acute viral or bacterial infections. The condition of 2 of the 3 patients is said to be critical. Two patients are being treated under ventilator. As happens in such cases, it takes time before the condition of such patients stabilizes as the recovery is slow," said Dr Chhari.

Another patient infected [affected, as GBS is an autoimmune disease triggered by an infection. - Mod.MPP] with Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) has come to light in Godhra. The female patient, admitted to a hospital in Anand since the past week, is a resident of the Bamroli Road area in Godhra. The total number of GBS cases reported in Godhra now stands at 13. As many as 12 cases had come to light by Wednesday [23 Feb 2022] evening. The previous cases were reported from Bhuravav.

The reason for the GBS outbreak remains a mystery despite teams from Panchmahal district as well as SSG Hospital (SSGH) and CMERS, Gotri Hospital in Vadodara visiting the affected areas.

An official said that no immediate trigger has been identified for the cases. Sources said that GBS cases can be seen in a cluster in places that have faced an outbreak of some disease earlier. However, no such outbreak has come to light so far. In GBS, the immune system attacks the peripheral nervous system of the body. It can be triggered by acute viral or bacterial infections.

[It appears as though active surveillance has been implemented in the affected districts -- apparently in a seek and ye shall find mode. So far, apparently no common infectious outbreaks have been identified in the preceding 3-4 weeks, the period usually associated with GBS occurrence. The selected references below are a sampling of types of outbreaks of infectious diseases that have had clusters of GBS cases associated -- often identified as an increase in baseline incidence of GBS in the area. Viral as well as bacterial agents have been associated with GBS clusters.

As requested in yesterday's post on this event, ProMED would greatly appreciate receiving information on results of the laboratory studies as well as the epidemiologic investigation.
