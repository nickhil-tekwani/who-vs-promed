Ring-fence vaccination would not have halted Britain's devastating 2001
epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), a new analysis suggests.
Blanket prophylactic vaccination or targeting high-risk farms first are the
best ways to avert or minimize future outbreaks of FMD, say the report's
authors, Matthew Keeling of the University of Warwick, UK, and colleagues.
Similar tactics, they reckon, could work for other animal and even human
diseases, such as influenza and smallpox.
The heat from pyres of burning carcasses has died down, but argument about
the management of Britain's worst-ever FMD outbreak has not. More than 6
million animals, mainly cows, sheep and pigs, were slaughtered before the
outbreak ended. Vaccination wasn't used because of pressure from farmers.
Under current European law, vaccinated animals cannot be bought or sold.
New tests for distinguishing vaccinated animals from infected ones, and
strategies such as those proposed in the new study, show that it's "time for
the rule book to catch up with the science", comments veterinary
immunologist Ian McConnell of the University of Cambridge, UK.
Based on data from the 2001 outbreak, Keeling and his colleagues designed a
model that predicted the infectious state of every farm in Britain each day.
They then replayed each day of the 7-month outbreak with 4 different
vaccination strategies.
Nation-wide vaccination of all animals before an outbreak offered the
greatest protection. Localized culling on and around infected farms was
still required, as there are always gaps in vaccine coverage.
Mass vaccination in response to an outbreak was the next best strategy. The
FMD vaccine takes 7 days to confer immunity, so extensive culling was again
required. In the model, this strategy knocked 4 months off the outbreak.
Ring-fence vaccination, where farms surrounding infected hotspots are
treated to contain the disease, failed because of the
vaccination-to-immunity lag and the rapid movement of animals before, and
for a time after, the outbreak was detected. Without a complete movement ban
on animals and people, says Keeling, "sparks of infection jump out of the
rings" and propagate the epidemic.
The researchers also used their model to identify a 'predictive' vaccination
strategy to be used in response to an epidemic. This tactic targets the
farms at greatest risk. In the model it shortened the outbreak almost as
much as mass vaccination.
Assuming that the necessary information about farms and animal movements is
at hand before an outbreak, the predictive approach is preferable, says
McConnell. Mass vaccination requires large amounts of vaccine and systems
for delivering it. In most parts of Europe, which suffer only occasional
outbreaks, it doesn't make economic sense. Predictive vaccination is "a
precise strategy", he says.
The poor performance of ring-fence vaccination in Keeling's study suggests
that it might fail for other diseases too. Infectivity and immunization are
different for different diseases, but "all have this transmission pattern",
says Keeling. Indeed, recent research showed that ring-fence vaccination
probably wouldn't contain smallpox.

[It is generally accepted that future outbreaks of FMD in Europe will be
treated in a different way than the traditional "stamping out without
vaccination" policy. The change has become more feasible following the
recent decision of the OIE to reduce the minimum period following emergency
vaccination before a country can reapply for full trade status from 12 to 6
months, only 3 months longer than for culling-only control measures.
Several inquiries have been carried out after the UK pandemic. One of the
involved institutions was the Royal Society, which published its extensive
report "Infectious diseases in livestock", dealing mainly with the 2001 FMD
outbreak in the UK, in July 2002:<http://reports.royalsoc.ac.uk/idl_sum.pdf>
The Report strongly recommended the use of emergency vaccination as an
important component of the control strategy for FMD. Culling of infected
premises, known dangerous contacts, and any other farms on which evidence of
disease is subsequently found will still be required, but emergency
vaccination could be far more appropriate than the alternative of extensive
culling.
The Report stated that several issues have to be solved before emergency
vaccination can be introduced. The main ones were:
1. The policy should be vaccinate-to-live. This will necessitate clear
acceptance by all concerned that meat and meat products from vaccinated
animals may enter the food chain normally.
2. Validation of the marker vaccines to be employed and the tests to
distinguish between vaccinated and vaccinated-infected animals, and clear
rules for defining the post-surveillance strategy for monitoring herds and
flocks.
3. Remaining trade implications both within and beyond the EU.
4. The precise vaccination strategy to be employed, including the threshold
criteria for its implementation when an outbreak occurs and the relative
focus upon geographical regions, high risk farms or species to be
vaccinated.
The Royal Society indicated that the precise vaccination strategy should be
chosen with the assistance of modelling, which "should play a key role
here". It seems that the model, published now by Matthew Keeling and his
colleagues, is meant to fulfill that very need. - Mod.AS]
