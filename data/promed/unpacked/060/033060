[There are] more than 50 cases and 17 deaths. This is the total that, to
date, the dreaded virus has left in our country according to a recent
epidemiological report by the Ministry of Health. The authorities, however,
although not frightened by the number, are concerned about facing a period
that seems more complex than in the past given the number of infected and dead.

According to the expert in Risk Prevention of Mutual Security [a Chilean
non-profit private institution in charge of risk prevention], Juan Carlos
Ahumada, "the increase in cases during this season is due to the beginning
of the pre-summer season during which schools and institutions schedule
outdoor trips which [provide] conditions for the appearance of long-tailed
[pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_)] in search of food.
Moreover, this has been a rainy year, with increased presence of quila [a
perennial bamboo that grows in the humid temperate forests of Chile and
Argentina] and greater availability of grain, preferred foods of these
rodents, increasing their reproduction.

Ahumada emphasizes that the groups of highest risk of infection by this
disease [virus] are residents of rural areas, agricultural and forestry
workers and then the visitors and those on excursions that, little by
little, appear seduced by the beauty and tranquility in these types of
landscapes. Regarding areas of risk, the specialist indicates that special
care [should be taken] in those areas with abundant native vegetation
[forests and brushy areas], covered with grass, and with the presence of
wild grains and fruits.

"The rodent that transmits the disease [virus] is found between Regions III
and XIII, preferentially in isolated areas. Being in places with these
characteristics, the risks of exposure to this dangerous virus increase, so
that it is necessary to be careful and apply all the preventive measures to
avoid being infected" the expert of Mutual Security stated.

The clinical picture caused by a variety of hantaviruses in Chile is called
hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome [HPS] and is similar to influenza.
Moreover, it is characterized by acute respiratory compromise, myalgias
and, in some cases, by gastrointestinal symptoms.

Despite that infected rodents have been found from the Metropolitan Region
to region XI, the cases are usually found from Region VI to Region XI.

To avoid infection by this dangerous disease [virus], the expert in Risk
Prevention of Mutual Security, Juan Carlos Ahumada, provides a battery of
important recommendations.

In the countryside:
- maintain weeds and pastures cut to ground level and cleared of debris and
rubble in a radius of 30 meters [32.8 yards] around the home;
- use gloves and masks when eliminating weeds, cutting or handling fire wood;
- protect animals that protect against rodents, such as snakes, foxes, or owls;
- air out for 30 minutes a place that has been continually closed before
entering;
- spray water or detergent with bleach before sweeping or cleaning;
- wear gloves when cleaning;
- seal with sheets of tin -- glued and nailed -- with concrete or other
strong materials, openings with a diameter of 0.5 cm [1/4 in] or larger, in
schools, warehouses, homes, and warehouses.

In houses:
- maintain the surroundings of the house free of leftover food [materials];
- eliminate rats and seal houses and storehouses;
- cut at ground level nearby shrubs and bushes;
- keep trash in strong containers and with tops, do not throw [garbage] in
the street or vacant lots;
- keep food in strong, covered containers;
- clean floors, tables, and surfaces with water with bleach or detergent.

The virus is sensitive to sunlight, detergents, and disinfectants (such as
bleach).

[Although not stated, the hantavirus responsible for HPS in the areas
mentioned above is Andes virus. Chile has had a series of HPS cases
especially January-May this year (2010). Reports of cases have been few
since then, but the season for transmission is again coming, hence the
report of total cases and warnings about risk of infections and how to
prevent them.
