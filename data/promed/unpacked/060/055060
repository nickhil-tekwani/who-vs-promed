3 girls in critical condition with symptoms of radiation sickness
----------------------------------------------------
The state of health of 3 girls who were poisoned by an unidentified
substance and were taken to the hospital on Fri 23 Apr 2004 remains
critical, a source with the Volgograd narcological rehabilitation center
told Interfax on Sat 24 Apr 2004. The girls were transferred to the center
from the village where they live early on Sat 24 Apr.
The source said all 3 sisters, aged 2 to 8, are in the intensive therapy
department, unconscious. What makes the situation even worse is that
doctors were asked for help relatively late, he said. The girls have been
preliminarily diagnosed with poisoning from heavy metal chlorides.
"However, the clinical symptoms in such cases are very similar to those
recorded in patients suffering radiation sickness. The final diagnosis will
be clear after the results of all tests become available tonight," he said.
Blood will also be taken for tests from the girls' older brother and their
mother, the source said.
When the children were first questioned, it was revealed that they had
thrown a bottle containing an unidentified substance into a fire. Experts
from the Emergency Situations Ministry determined that this occurred on 18
Apr, but the children's mother sent for a doctor only on 21 Apr 2004, after
the girls' health had seriously deteriorated and they started to lose hair.
A radiological team from the regional civil defense and emergency
situations department is working at the scene. The experts are examining
the house and the nearby area and are also taking water samples from a
nearby artesian well for tests.

3 seriously poisoned with unknown substance in Volgograd
--------------------------------------------------------
3 girls with the symptoms initially thought to be radiation disease were
admitted Fri, 23 Apr 2004 to the Volgograd regional hospital. The condition
of children (aged from 4 to 9 years) is very serious.
One of the girls has already been preliminarily diagnosed as suffering
poisoning with heavy metals, not radiation disease. The substance with
which the girls were poisoned could be arsenic or thallium, used against
rodents.
According to the girls themselves, they made a bonfire in a yard, where
they found a bottle containing fluid and threw it into the bonfire. It
started producing white smoke with a suffocating smell. The following day,
the children started to experience gastrointestinal problems, dizziness,
weakness, leg pain, and loss of appetite. In several days, the girls had
complete hair loss. At the present time, the condition of 2 of the girls is
severe, and they are in the intensive care unit.
The contents of the bottle have not yet been identified, but sanitary
epidemiological surveillance center staff are analyzing the soil and water
taken from the area of the bonfire. A preliminary hypothesis involves
poisoning with heavy metals, the symptoms of which are similar to those of
radiation disease.

Two year old dies of arsenic poisoning
--------------------------------------
A young girl died on Wednesday in the central Russian town of Volgograd
after apparently being poisoned by an unknown substance together with her 2
sisters, a source in the local hospital told MosNews.
The girl, just 2 years old, died in the local toxic substance hospital,
where she was being treated together with her sisters after symptoms of
poisoning were identified. The cause of death was reportedly arsenic
poisoning. Earlier news agencies reported that the 3 girls suffered from
poisoning Friday near the city of Volgograd after being near a bonfire
containing an unknown substance that apparently gave off dangerous fumes as
it burned. The girls were initially diagnosed with radiation sickness, but
then physicians determined that they had heavy metal poisoning. However, a
medical source told MosNews that the more likely cause was that the girls
had ingested arsenic, possibly in the form of rat poisoning. The 2 other
girls, 6 and 8, remain in critical condition.

[The youngest of the sisters died on 28 Apr 2004. Although the classical
poisoning cause of hair loss is related to thallium -- which is an
ingredient in rat poison in parts of the world -- a number of other metal
salts may cause an effluvium, including bismuth, lead, aluminum, arsenic
and mercury. - Mod.LL]
