The Health Protection Agency (HPA) has seen 7 cases of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis PT1 following consumption of a pasteurized liquid egg product which was sold through Myprotein and Nutri Centre websites and Nutri Centre stores. Testing of a sample of the product also showed a positive result for the same type of _Salmonella_. No other products are known to be affected.

The product, a Myprotein own brand "Free Range Liquid Egg Whites," was recalled on 10 Oct 2012 by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and the company are no longer selling it. The FSA are working to identify the source of the eggs used in the product.

There has been no national increase in this type of salmonellosis. In the 7 weeks from the end of August to 9 Oct 2012 (weeks 34-40) there were a total of 42 non-travel cases of _S._ Enteritidis PT 1 reported to the HPA (including the 7 cases above). This is compared to 48 and 47 cases in the same weeks in 2010 and 2011 respectively.

The 42 cases seen in 2012 have been reported from most regions and range in age from infants to 78 years of age. There are more females than males (24 vs. 18) with half of the females being under 10 years of age. The male cases are spread across most age groups.

Dr Bob Adak, the head of the gastrointestinal diseases department at the HPA said: "This egg product has been subject to a recall and so we hope that now that it is no longer in circulation that this will stop people becoming unwell. If anyone has any of this batch of product at home then they should dispose of it.

"Although there has been no increase in the number of cases of this type of salmonella over recent weeks we are still investigating whether newly identified cases might be related to this egg product. To do this we intend to interview patients using a food questionnaire. As usual we will be working with our colleagues in the Food Standards Agency (FSA)."

[The main vehicle for the transmission of _S._ Enteritidis to human is the chicken egg. In chickens, this organism colonizes internal organs as well as the tissues of the reproductive tract including the ovaries, oviduct, cloacal and vaginal tissues. From the ovaries, the organism can contaminate the yolk in some eggs, but the majority of salmonellae are deposited from the reproductive tract to the albumen (egg white) close to the yolk membrane or on the viteline membrane. The contaminating bacteria survive in the albumen as the eggshell forms and persists after eggs are laid.

Although a small cluster of cases of this serotype which was also isolated from the vehicle, it is particularly relevant that the product itself had been pasteurized.

Latimer and colleagues (1) in the USA performed a risk assessment analysis of salmonellosis in pasteurized egg products and found the egg white was likely to be the highest risk.

Abstract
"As part of the process for developing risk-based performance standards for egg product processing, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) undertook a quantitative microbial risk assessment for Salmonella spp. in pasteurized egg products. The assessment was designed to assist risk managers in evaluating egg handling and pasteurization performance standards for reducing the likelihood of Salmonella in pasteurized egg products and the subsequent risk to human health.

"The following 7 pasteurized liquid egg product formulations were included in the risk assessment model, with the value in parentheses indicating the estimated annual number of human illnesses from Salmonella from each: egg white (2636), whole egg (1763), egg yolk (708), whole egg with 10 percent salt (407), whole egg with 10 percent sugar (0), egg yolk with 10 percent salt (11), and egg yolk with 10 percent sugar (0). Increased levels of pasteurization were predicted to be highly effective mitigations for reducing the number of illnesses. For example, if all egg white products were pasteurized for a 6-log(10) reduction of Salmonella, the estimated annual number of illnesses from these products would be reduced from 2636 to 270. The risk assessment identified several data gaps and research needs, including a quantitative study of cross-contamination during egg product processing and characterization of egg storage times and temperatures (i) on farms and in homes, (ii) for eggs produced off-line, and (iii) for egg products at retail. Pasteurized egg products are a relatively safe food; however, findings from this study suggest increased pasteurization can make them safer."

Elements of the egg white can restrict the growth of the organism. As reported by Kang and others (2), a major factor that controlled growth in egg albumen is iron restriction, since egg albumen supplemented with iron allows growth, and iron acquisition mutants of the organism shows decreased survival in egg albumen. In addition, low pH of albumen, high concentrations of bacteria and low incubation temperatures of bacteria with albumen facilitates the survival of the organism.
