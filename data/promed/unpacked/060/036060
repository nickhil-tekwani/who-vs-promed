Food poisoning in Amur region affects 174 people
------------------------------------------------
The number of people taken to the hospital with food poisoning, in the town
of Tambovka, in the Far-Eastern Amur region, has risen to 174. A total of
80 graduates of a local school, their parents, and teachers were rushed to
hospitals. All of them were affected by the poisoning during a graduation
party.
Spokespeople for the Far-Eastern division of Russia's Emergency Situations
Ministry described the condition of the sick patients as satisfactory,
adding that an epidemiological inquiry into the case of group-poisoning had
been organized. Epidemics experts have organized a house-by-house
inspection in the town in a bid to identify the people who had contacts
with the patients.
Doctors at the isolation hospital of the regional capital city,
Blagoveschensk, have organized an additional 50 beds to admit new possible
patients, and 40 more beds have been put up at the hospitals of the nearby
towns of Razdolnoye and Aleksandrovka.

More victims at graduation party held in the Amur region
--------------------------------------------------------
The number of people admitted to hospital with salmonella poisoning has
risen to 207. The incident of food poisoning was reported after a school
graduation party, held in the settlement of Tambovka, in the Amur region,
last week [3rd week of June 2004]. 77 people suffering from food poisoning
were admitted to hospital at the regional center of Blagoveschensk, because
there were not enough hospital beds in the local hospital.
Eighty-four per cent of the patients have tested positive for
salmonellosis, Itar-Tass was told, at the Sanitary Surveillance Committee
of the Amur region on Tue 28 Jun 2004. The rest have been diagnosed as
infected with staphylococcus. Most of the patients admitted to hospital are
in a satisfactory condition, hospital personnel said. Sanitary preventive
measures have been taken in the settlement where the incident took place.
Experts established that the infection was in egg and squid salads served
at the party. Documents with the results of the medical examination have
been sent to the local prosecutor's office, which will open a criminal case.
The school graduates, who landed in the hospital during the period of
entrance examinations to higher educational establishments, will be given
an opportunity to take entrance examinations after they undergo the
necessary treatment, the local administration said.

[The illness attack rate here is not clear, since the denominator of how
many individuals were at the graduation party is not stated. It appears
that most of the cases are due to salmonellosis, although a small
percentage of cases, apparently, suffered from staphylococcal toxin
illness. The illnesses should be relatively easily distinguished, as
salmonellosis has an incubation period of 18 to 48 hours and is associated
with fever and diarrhea, whereas staphylococcal food poisoning has an
incubation period of less than 8 hours, is generally not associated with
fever, and causes, primarily, vomiting, not diarrhea. - Mod.LL]
