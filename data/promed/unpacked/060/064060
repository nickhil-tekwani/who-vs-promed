The NSW Department of Primary Industries (DPI) yesterday [13 Feb 2020] urged producers to vaccinate their livestock following confirmation of the 1st case of anthrax for 2020.

The detection occurred on the NSW Central Tablelands on a property with no previous record of anthrax. The affected animals were ewes having not been vaccinated for anthrax.

Biosecurity measures at the affected property, including stock movement restrictions and the vaccination of remaining livestock, were immediately imposed.

DPI Senior Veterinary Officer Dr Graham Bailey said that while there are no general public health risks or trade implications from the detection, it served as a timely reminder. Cases of anthrax in NSW tend to occur in an area which runs through the centre of the state, between Bourke and Moree in the north, to Albury and Deniliquin in the south.

"Anthrax can be prevented by annual vaccination of cattle and sheep. Producers in high risk locations are encouraged to consider vaccination," Dr Bailey said.

Central Tablelands Local Land Services District Veterinarian Amy Masters said that those wishing to vaccinate can apply to their Local Land Services District Veterinarian. "Once approved, you can order the vaccine through your local rural supplier or private veterinarian," Dr Masters said.

[This report differs little from the previous report, but clearly vaccination is now in hand and active. It will be effective. But this report is a subset of a report of excessive rains in Queensland, NSW, and the Northern Territory, see: https://www.beefcentral.com/production/rain-event-sparks-three-day-buffalo-fly-anthrax-outbreaks/ posted on 15 Feb 2020: Bovine ephemeral fever - Australia (QL, NS, NT) cattle 20200215.6993450. Read the full Beef Central article and the moderator's comments.

The local authorities comment forcefully about the significant increased numbers of biting flies following these heavy rains. And in the surge of sick cattle, animals dying of anthrax can be missed.

[From: http://www.idph.state.il.us/envhealth/pcblackflies_buffalognats.htm]:
"Black flies, also known as buffalo gnats (_Simuliidae_) because of their humpbacked appearance, are small (up to 1/8th of an inch long) dark flies that typically appear in late spring and early summer, when they swarm and bite birds and mammals, including domestic animals and people.

Males and females feed on nectar. Male black flies do not bite, but females of most species must feed on blood to produce eggs. Some prefer to bite one type of host. Some species bite people in certain locales, but do not bite in other parts of the species' range. Like horse and deer flies, black flies bite using their mouthparts like scissors to cut into skin and lap up the blood. This results in painful bites that can produce bleeding, itching, inflammation and swelling, as well as allergic reactions that can be life-threatening."

It will be interesting to see whether further investigations in NSW identity these buffalo flies as a risk in the field epidemiology of livestock anthrax. - Mod.MHJ
