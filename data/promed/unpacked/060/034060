Thousands of chickens could be put down after an outbreak of avian influenza (bird flu) in central-west New South Wales. The Langfield Pastoral Company (LPC) property which houses 400 000 layer chooks [Aussi slang for chickens. - Mod.MHJ] is infected with the H7 strain, which is not the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain that kills humans.

A neighbouring poultry farm is in quarantine and the Department of Agriculture has established control restrictions 10 kilometres [6.2 mi] around the infected farm.

Food Authorities have confirmed that the eggs are still safe to eat and there's no threat to human safety.

The NSW Farmers Association's Egg Committee chair, Bede Burke, says the farm owners would be devastated.

The outbreak of H7 avian influenza on LPC's egg farm at Bendick Murrell, on the south west slopes of NSW, has already wiped out more than 2000 birds and that number is rising fast.

Mr Burke says the family who run the farm are still coming to terms with a very grim reality. "Their free range farm, that we understand has come down with this initially before it subsequently spread to the cage farm, was of world class standard. For them to get an incursion just says to the rest of the farmers, we need to beef up our biosecurity and be vigilant."

The Langfield family which operates the farm has been recognised for its innovative work in egg production, including efforts to improve chook welfare and adopt free range farming techniques.

The H7 strain of bird flu is believed to have been spread by wild ducks.

Authorities are still conducting tests to determine just how infectious it is. The New South Wales Department of Primary Industries [DPI] has quarantined the farm. Officials went to the farm today [16 Oct 2013] to decide whether birds will need to be destroyed. Ian Roth, the DPI's chief veterinary officer, says precautions are already in place. "We've set up a little, what we call state control centre here, and we'll set up a local control centre at Young and we'll start doing that tracing and just see where it's gone to." Dr Roth says it could spread elsewhere, and may in fact have done that already. The DPI is investigating if that is the case.

A high level meeting is being held today [16 Oct 2013] with representatives from all states and territories to determine how to deal with the bird flu outbreak at the Langfield Pastoral company.

NSW DPI Chief Vet Ian Roth says it is "highly likely" that control measures will be approved today [16 Oct 2013], including the culling of all the birds and that federal funds will be released for the clean up and eradication of bird flu.

[This outbreak at Bendick Murrell, NE of Young, appears to be the same outbreak notified by OIE that started on 8 Oct 2013 (see ProMED-mail post 20131016.2005157). As the poultry farm is relatively isolated, the source of infection is still unknown. However they had free-range birds which came down before the caged egg-layers so one might presume the infection was via virus-shedding wild birds. And H7 was seen in NSW in 2012.
