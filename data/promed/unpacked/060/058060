AVIAN INFLUENZA, HUMAN - EAST ASIA (51): DEATH RATE

I belive that Dr. Altman's comment in his New York Times article that
"The bottom line is that more human avian influenza may be around
than once suspected, but fewer people who get it become gravely ill
and die than initially predicted" is not only an oversimplification
(as he himself stated) but also potentially misleading as well.
I agree with the author that the existence of undetected asymptomatic
cases may indicate that the mortality/morbidity ratio may indeed be
lower than expected on the basis of the available data.
Nonetheless, Dr. Altman's comments in the article do not appear to
take into account the full implications of the potential additive
mortality as well as morbidity associated with atypical cases
involving gastroenteritis/encephalitis symptoms in the absence of any
associated respiratory syndrome, for which there appear to be no
reliable data other that that such mortality can and has occurred in
at least one known and one suspected case (de Jong et al., 2005 Mew
England J Medicine
<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/352/7/686>).
I think that what needs to be emphasized in this context is that not
only have more people been infected with H5N1 bird flu than current
official statistics indicate (as detailed in the NY Times article),
but that the number of people who have actually died from both
typical and atypical H5N1 infections -- untested, unnoticed, or
unconfirmed -- is also undoubtedly much higher than the available
data will show.
There is therefore great need to increase both the accuracy of
laboratory confirmations for H5N1 infections in Vietnam, and to
increase the rates of testing of potential atypical cases to
determine the potential frequency and number of human deaths
associated with atypical H5N1 infections involving only gastroenteric
and/or encephalitis symptoms that may have occurred in Vietnam,
Thailand, and potentially elsewhere in Southeast Asia.

With reference to the ProMED posting by Dr. Altman, do you think it
is still prudent to continue to report the human death rates due to
avian influenza in Southeast Asia, and create a worldwide panic about
pandemic flu? Does anyone know the true denominator?

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Drs. Dudley and Prasad for their
comments, which when juxtaposed, summarize quite nicely the varying
viewpoints in how to interpret what is currently going on in East
Asia with respect to human disease related to H5N1. It is clear that
we are "overdue" for a flu pandemic if one looks back at the 20th
century and influenza patterns. It is also clear that the majority
of significant antigenic shifts in influenza viruses have occurred in
East Asia. Current thinking is that these antigenic shifts are a
result of genetic reassortment of avian influenza viruses with human
influenza viruses, resulting in former avian influenza viruses
adapting themselves to a new species (humans) where they can be
transmitted with ease, as there is virtually no pre-existing immunity
in the new species.
Current thinking is also that the pig serves as the "cauldron" or
mixing vessel for this reassortment, as it can be infected with both
avian and human influenza viruses. That being said, the current
activity with H5N1 in East Asia seems to be going in a direction
consistent with prevailing theories on influenza virus evolution:
repeated infections in the human host, looking for a good mixing
vessel for genetic reassortment to permit adding humans to its
current host range.
But (and a big one), we are still very much on the upward slope of
the learning curve with respect to H5N1 and human disease in East
Asia. As mentioned by Dr. Dudley, there are the case reports of
non-pulmonary disease associated with fatal outcome, and as mentioned
in Dr. Altman's article, there are reports of asymptomatic or mild
disease now associated with H5N1 infection. As Dr. Altman points
out, there are very few viral agents with case fatality rates as high
as currently observed with H5N1 human infection, a fact that may not
be accidental in "Mother's Nature's" bigger picture, as a virus that
is highly lethal to its host is suicidal, eliminating all potential
hosts with time.
Hence, the occurrence/identification of mild and asymptomatic
infections with H5N1 leads one to speculate along several lines. One
is that -- now that we are looking -- we are finding (this moderators
favorite expression "seek and ye shall find"). Another possible
theory is that the H5N1 is in fact starting to prepare itself for
survival in another host, thereby undergoing attenuation in terms of
expression of disease in humans. Yet another possibility is that the
very severe disease that is being observed may be host-specific, and
may be related to genetic predispositions in those severely affected.
One observation leading to the last speculation is that, with the
close proximity of humans and avians in East Asia, and the high
population density of both humans and avians in East Asia, why have
there been so few cases of H5N1 infection in humans, when there has
certainly been significant exposure to the virus?
So this moderator shall end the musings above that support both Dr.
Dudley's significant concern about a possible impending influenza
pandemic caused by H5N1, and Dr. Prasad's concern that there may be
an over-reaction and the creation of panic while the full data set is
still pending. The verdict is not in yet. - Mod.MPP
