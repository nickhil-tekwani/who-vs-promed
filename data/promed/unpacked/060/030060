You wrote: "Data on the age of the current, 2nd FSE case in Switzerland and
on the suspected petfood will be helpful."
1. The patient was an owned, female, European short-haired cat, 5 years
old, from a semi-urban area.
2. In the investigation with the cat-owner, a clear source of infection
[such as a slaughterhouse, a zoo, a rendering plant, an incinerator, or a
cattle farm - Mod.AS] could not be identified, but the owner stated clearly
that the cat was often outside and was fed by other people, in addition to
eating the commercial pet food supplied by the owner.
3. The cat showed typical symptoms; the diagnosis was confirmed by
histology and immunohistochemistry in the BSE-reference laboratory in Berne.
