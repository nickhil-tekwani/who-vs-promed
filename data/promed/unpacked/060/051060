The US Department of Agriculture on [Tue 16 Dec 2014] confirmed the presence of 2 different strains of H5 avian flu virus in wild birds in Whatcom County [Washington state], but said there was no immediate public health concern.

"Both H5N2 and [H5N8] viruses have been found in other parts of the world and have not caused any human infection to date," USDA said.

The department said HPAI H5N2 avian influenza was discovered in northern pintail ducks and HPAI H5N8 strain was found in captive gyrfalcons that were fed hunter-killed wild birds.

"Neither virus has been found in commercial poultry anywhere in the United States," USDA said.

The finding in Whatcom County was quickly reported and identified due to increased surveillance for avian influenza in light of the strain affecting commercial poultry in British Columbia, the USDA said.

The USDA, Washington state, and other federal partners are working on additional surveillance and testing of birds in the nearby area.

All bird owners are encouraged to practice good biosecurity, prevent contact between their birds and wild birds, and to report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to state/federal officials. Call your local vet or USDA's toll-free number at 866-536-7593. Additional information on biosecurity of backyard flocks can be found at http://www.healthybirds.aphis.usda.gov.

The Washington State Department of Agriculture said it will hold a town hall meeting [Thu 18 Dec 2014] to discuss the findings and steps poultry owners should take to protect their birds. The town hall will be held at 6 pm [Thu 18 Dec 2014], in the Mount Baker Rotary Building at the Northwest Washington Fairgrounds in Lynden. It is open to the public.

Detection of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Viruses H5N2 and H5N8 in the United States, Washington State
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This Bulletin provides information on the current situation regarding the recent detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) H5N2 and H5N8 in wild and captive birds in the United States. Following reports of recent outbreaks of HPAIV in poultry in British Columbia, Canada, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife together with the USGS National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC) and the US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Wildlife Services investigated a waterfowl mortality event on Wiser Lake in Whatcom County, Washington adjacent to the affected area in Canada. Mortality of a captive gyrfalcon that had recently been fed waterfowl meat from the area was also investigated. Gross examinations and microbiological culture analyses of the waterfowl carcasses indicated aspergillosis in several of the birds. In addition, virology analyses conducted in collaboration with the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratories confirmed the presence of HPAIV H5 avian influenza in 2 of the birds.

Two separate virus strains were identified: HPAIV H5N2 in a wild northern pintail duck (_Anas acuta_) and HPAIV H5N8 in a captive gyrfalcon (_Falco rusticolus_) that was fed wild waterfowl from this site. Both viruses have been determined to have an amino acid sequence at the hemagglutinin cleavage site consistent with HPAIV. Preliminary data suggest that these virus strains (H5N2 and H5N8) may be related to an HPAIV H5N8 previously known to have circulated during 2014 among wild birds and poultry (chickens and ducks) in Asia and Western Europe. Wild bird species known to be infected with HPAIV H5N8 and a timeline of major HPAIV H5N8 events during 2014 are summarized in Tables 1 and 2, respectively [available at the source URL above]. The novel H5N2 and H5N8 detections in the United States that are described in this Bulletin only involve free-ranging and captive wild birds, and further investigation and characterization of the HPAIVs is ongoing. Neither of these viruses has been found in commercial poultry anywhere in the United States.

The NWHC is continuing to monitor for HPAIV by testing sick and dead migratory birds. In an effort to maximize early detection of HPAIV and to understand the spatial extent and species involvement of H5 HPAIV in North America, wildlife managers should remain vigilant for wild bird morbidity and mortality events and continue to submit carcasses from any events that meet the criteria described below.

Submission criteria
-------------------
1. Mortality events of any size involving waterfowl (ducks, geese, and swans) or other water birds (loons, grebes, coots, shorebirds or wading birds such as egrets/herons).
2. Mortality events of any size involving North American avian scavenger species (raptors, ravens, crows, or gulls), particularly those observed near locations with on-going waterbird mortality.
3. Mortality events involving single- or multiple bird species where estimated total mortality exceeds 500 birds.
4. Other examples of events that warrant investigation include mortality events involving any wild bird species occurring in close proximity to poultry operations, or mortality events associated with captive birds that have been imported from countries where H5 or H7 HPAIVs are known to occur.

NWHC will also test for HPAIV in other species when the circumstances of disease outbreaks, including rapid mortality progression or pathologic findings, suggest that avian influenza may be a factor.

These criteria may be revised in the future as more information on pathogen distribution is obtained from enhanced HPAIV surveillance efforts. NWHC will continue submitting samples to the USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories for confirmatory testing and for mortality events exceeding 500 birds.

There has to date been no evidence of HPAIV H5N2- or H5N8-related illness in humans, but appropriate hygiene measures should be observed when handling wild birds. Recommended hygiene measures and useful links are also provided below.

Recommendations
---------------
Hunters should follow these routine precautions when handling game:
- Do not handle or eat sick game.
- Wear rubber or disposable latex gloves while handling and cleaning game.
- Wash hands and thoroughly clean knives, equipment and surfaces that come into contact with game.
- Do not eat, drink, or smoke while handling animals.
- All game should be thoroughly cooked (internal temperature of 165 deg F [74 deg C]).

Field biologists handling sick or dead birds associated with a mortality event should:
- Wear rubber, latex, or nitrile gloves that can be disinfected or discarded and protective eyewear or a face shield while handling animals.
- Wear protective clothing, including coveralls and rubber boots.
- Minimize respiratory exposure by wearing a respirator/mask (NIOSH N95 or better).
- Wash hands often and disinfect work surfaces and equipment before travelling between sites.
- Do not eat, drink, or smoke while handling animals.
- Properly dispose of potentially infectious material including carcasses. For additional information see the USGS Field Manual of Wildlife Diseases (http://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/publications/field_manual/).

[Avian influenza (AI) is caused by type A influenza virus. The signs can vary from a mild disease with little or no mortality to a highly fatal, rapidly spreading epidemic (highly pathogenic avian influenza) depending on the infecting virus strain, host factors, and environmental stressors. Signs of avian influenza are extremely variable. In some flocks the only evidence of the infection is seroconversion, that is, the birds develop a detectable antibody titer to AI. AI can also be manifest as respiratory, enteric, reproductive, or nervous system disease. Decreased food consumption and drops in egg production are among some of the earliest and most predictable signs of disease.

Signs including coughing, sneezing, ruffled feathers, swollen heads, nervous signs like depression, and diarrhea may occur together or singly. In some cases, birds die rapidly without clinical signs of disease.

Wild birds and their excreta should be considered a major source of avian influenza. Preventing direct contact with free-flying birds and protecting domestic poultry from contact with the feces of wild birds is an important way to prevent avian influenza.

Influenza viruses are very sensitive to most detergents and disinfectants. They are readily inactivated by heating and drying. However, flu viruses are well protected from inactivation by organic material and infectious virus can be recovered from manure for up to 105 days. Complete removal of all organic material is part of any effective disinfection procedure.

Contaminated houses are heated for several days to inactivate virus. Organic material is removed followed by complete cleaning and disinfection of all surfaces. Contaminated litter and manure are problematic and should be composted or buried to ensure that they do not spread infectious virus.
