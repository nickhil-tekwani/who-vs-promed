[The OIE WAHID report above references the Danish
Veterinary and Food Administration website, which
contains useful information on a previous similar
2008 outbreak of low pathogenic H7N1. A brief
summary is provided and I have copied it below:

On 28 Apr 2008 an outbreak of low pathogenic
avian influenza of the type H7N1 was found in a
holding with geese, ducks and mallards near
Stenstrup in Svendborg municipality on the island
of Funen. The holding was tested in accordance
with the Danish surveillance programme for avian
influenza in poultry. The Danish Veterinary and
Food Administration established a restricted zone
of 1 km around the holding and implemented the
control measures in accordance with Council
directive 2005/94/EC.

I encourage you to look at the website, though, for additional information.

A 2nd important detail is the fact that the birds
appear to be game bird (mallards) and that the
outbreaks in 2008 and 2006 also involved mallards
or other waterbirds, rather than commercial or
backyard chickens. The OIE WAHID immediate report
for 2008 describes the affected population as: A
poultry holding with 250 geese, 500 ducks and
2000 mallards. See Avian influenza (66): Japan,
swan, Denmark, LPAI H7, OIE 20080430.1484. Please
note that the number of birds given in the
archived OIE WAHID report is different from what
we originally published by 700 birds, a
discrepancy for which I cannot readily explain
but I do not think is important.
