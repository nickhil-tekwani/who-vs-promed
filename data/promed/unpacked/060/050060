The Euro 2020 soccer final between England and Italy in July [2021] was a "superspreader" event due to the level of COVID-19 infection found in or around London's Wembley Stadium on the day, according to official data published on Friday [20 Aug 2021].

Public Health England said 2295 people were likely to have been infectious with a further 3404 people potentially acquiring infection at the 11 Jul [2021] match.

The match, with a crowd of around 67 000 inside the stadium, was England's 1st final in an international soccer tournament since the country hosted and won the 1966 World Cup.

"Euro 2020 was a unique occasion, and it is unlikely we would see a similar impact on COVID-19 cases from future events," said Jenifer Smith, Public Health England's deputy medical director, in a statement. "However, the data does show how easily the virus can spread when there is close contact, and this should be a warning to us all as we try and return to a cautious normality once again."

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-data-shows-mass-events-can-take-place-safely-but-fans-urged-to-remain-cautious-in-crowds-and-get-vaccinated


Data from NHS [National Health Service] Test and Trace shows that mass participation events can be conducted safely, but caution must still be taken around specific aspects of event participation.

The data, drawn from a range of the 37 trial events that have formed the Events Research Programme over a 4-month period, has shown that case numbers were largely in line with or below community infection rates for the duration of the programme.

However, a cautious approach should be taken at unstructured events involving attendees being in close proximity for extended periods of time, when spectators are at high-density pinch points at venues, when travelling to and from events, and when mixing indoors before, during, and after events.

Figures published today show that 585 cases were recorded by NHS Test and Trace at the time of the British Grand Prix, which hosted the largest crowd in the UK in over 18 months with over 350 000 people in attendance across 3 days.

When broken down, the 585 cases from the Grand Prix show that 343 of those cases were likely to have already been infectious around the time of the event, while 242 cases are from people likely to have acquired an infection around the time of the event.

In England over this period, 1.36-1.57% of people were testing positive for COVID-19, which equates to between 1/75 to 1/65 people.

Data from The Wimbledon Championships, which hosted around 300 000 people over a 2-week period, recorded 881 cases through NHS Test and Trace.

This data breaks down to 299 cases that were likely to have already been infectious around the time of the event, with 582 cases likely to have acquired an infection around the time of the event. In England over this time period, 0.31-1.36% of people were testing positive for COVID-19, which equates to between 1/320 and 1/75 people.

The data from these 2 events, alongside the majority of others conducted as part of the Events Research Programme, demonstrate that mass participation events can be conducted safely, with case numbers comparable to, or lower than, community prevalence. It is, however, important to note that when observing this data, assumptions cannot be made that transmission definitely happened at the event, nor that individuals became infected at the time of their attendance at an event.

Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said, "We've shown that we can reintroduce mass sports and cultural events safely, but it is important that people remain cautious when mixing in very crowded settings.

"So that we can keep the football season, theatres, and gigs safe with full crowds this winter, I urge sport, music, and culture fans to get the vaccine, as this is the safest way we can get big events firing on all cylinders once more."

Health Minister, Lord Bethell, said, "Data is our greatest weapon in the fight against the pandemic, and these pilots inform our approach to mass events, now and in the future.

"These events and the passion of supporters brought joy to millions of people across the country. But the reports make it clear that they also reinforce the need for us to not let our guard down. We all need to comply with the advice accompanying major events to keep everyone safe and so everyone can safely enjoy these important occasions. We can all keep doing our bit by getting tested regularly and getting the vaccine."

The 2 Euro 2020 matches on 7 and 11 Jul [2021] were events of national significance in England. They took place during a period of higher underlying community prevalence and drew significant numbers of ticketless individuals to the area surrounding Wembley Stadium, likely contributing to the increased infections data around these events.

The associated Public Health England / NHS Test and Trace data for the Euro 2020 final shows that 2295 people in or around the stadium were likely to have been infectious at the time of the event, with an additional 3404 people in and around the stadium potentially acquiring infection around the time of the event.

Dr Jenifer Smith, Deputy Medical Director, Public Health England, said, "Euro 2020 was a unique occasion, and it is unlikely we would see a similar impact on COVID-19 cases from future events.

"However, the data does show how easily the virus can spread when there is close contact, and this should be a warning to us all as we try and return to a cautious normality once again. When attending large events, there are actions we can all take to help reduce the risk. These include getting both doses of the vaccine as soon as you can, wearing a face covering in enclosed spaces such as on public transport on your way, and if you are catching up with friends before an event, consider doing so outdoors to reduce the risk of the virus spreading.

"Please do not attend events if you have symptoms; you must isolate and get a test as soon as possible. If you are a contact of a confirmed case and have had both doses of the vaccine, although you don't need to isolate, you should still get a PCR test and limit socialising to keep your loved ones and the wider community safe."

The significant numbers of people seen outside Wembley Stadium at the Euro 2020 Final, and the events taking place under Step 4, are likely to make comparisons with the other ERP events misleading. As set out in the PHE research paper, while useful for informing the approach to managing risks at major sports events, these games are not considered typical of standard sporting events and should not be used as comparators.

On the days of England's latter Euro 2020 matches, data published by PHE shows there were subsequent spikes in cases across the country. The data shows that individuals tested positive reported participating in a variety of activities including visiting bars, pubs, other households, and eating out on match days. This data highlights the need for members of the public to remain cautious in all settings, whether that be at an event or in homes, pubs, or bars when coming together with family, friends, or other members of the public.

The Latitude and Tramlines festivals took place after Step 4 of the Government's roadmap out of lockdown on 21 Jul 2021, when community prevalence rates were higher. The data published from these events shows they have been associated with a higher number of cases (over 1000 per event) through NHS Test and Trace data.

[It would be safest if masks and vaccination or indication of immunity were required for entry to indoor mass participation events. However, that still would not solve the problem of protecting large numbers of people hanging out around the event. The only solution is that every effort is made to vaccinate the masses and encourage use of masks. - Mod.LK]

Abstract
---------
A subset of events within the UK Government Events Research Programme (ERP), developed to examine the risk of transmission of COVID-19 from attendance at events, was examined to explore the public health impact of holding mass sporting events. The events were part of the ERP. This additional public health analysis from routine contact tracing data was not part of the pre-registered protocols and analysed as part of daily public health analysis.

We used contact tracing data routinely collected through telephone interviews and online questionnaires, recording postcodes and location types attended in the potentially infectious (day -2 to day 0) and potentially acquired (day -3 to day -7) time periods, to describe the potential public health impact of the large sporting and cultural events on potential transmission and incidence of COVID-19.

Data from the Euro 2020 matches hosted at Wembley identified very high numbers of individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 and were traced through NHS Test and Trace. This included both individuals who were potentially infectious (3071) and those who acquired their infection during the time of the tournament (6784). This is in contrast with the All England Lawn Tennis Championships at Wimbledon (and other events), where there were similar number of spectators and venue capacity but there were lower total numbers of potentially infectious cases (299) and potentially acquired cases (582).

While the infections associated with the Euro 2020 event may be attributed to a set of circumstances (once-in-a-generation experience for many) which are unlikely to be replicated for the forthcoming sporting season, other aspects may be important to consider including mitigations for spectators to consider such as face coverings when travelling to and from events, minimising crowding in poorly ventilated indoors spaces such as bars and pubs where people may congregate to watch events. It is also important to minimise the risk of transmission from aerosol exposure related to singing and chanting in large groups by improving ventilation in enclosed spaces.

Discussion
------
Neither full vaccination nor a negative LFD [lateral flow device] test will completely eliminate the possibility of an infectious individual attending an event, but it should reduce the likelihood of someone transmitting highly infectious amounts of virus to a large number of individuals attending the event (11, 12, 13).

[2] Israel: infection rate
Date: Fri 20 Aug 2021 11:01 a.m. ET
Source: NPR Goats and Soda [edited]
https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2021/08/20/1029628471/highly-vaccinated-israel-is-seeing-a-dramatic-surge-in-new-covid-cases-heres-why


Israel was the 1st country on Earth to fully vaccinate a majority of its citizens against COVID-19. Now it has one of the world's highest daily infection rates, an average of nearly 7500 confirmed cases a day, double what it was 2 weeks ago. Nearly one in every 150 people in Israel today has the virus.

What happened, and what can be learned about the vaccine's impact on a highly vaccinated country? Here are 6 lessons learned, and one looming question for the future of the pandemic.

1. Immunity from the vaccine dips over time.
Israel had fully vaccinated slightly over half its population by 25 Mar [2021]. Infections waned, venues reopened to the vaccinated, and the prime minister told Israelis to go out and have fun. By June [2021], all restrictions, including indoor masking, were abolished.

But Israel paid a price for the early rollout. Health officials, and then Pfizer, said their data showed a dip in the vaccine's protection around 6 months after receiving the 2nd shot.

2. The delta variant broke through the vaccine's waning protection.
It was a perfect storm: The vaccine's waning protection came around the same time the more infectious delta variant arrived in Israel this summer. Delta accounts for nearly all infections in Israel today.

"The most influential event was so many people who went abroad in the summer -- vacations -- and brought the delta variant very, very quickly to Israel," said Siegal Sadetzki, a former public health director in Israel's Health Ministry.

3. If you get infected, being vaccinated helps.
The good news is that among Israel's serious infections on Thursday [19 Aug 2021] of this week, according to Health Ministry data, the rate of serious cases among unvaccinated people over age 60 (178.7 per 100 000) was 9 times more than the rate among fully vaccinated people of the same age category, and the rate of serious cases among unvaccinated people in the under-60 crowd (3.2 per 100 000) was a little more than double the rate among vaccinated people in that age bracket.

The bad news, doctors say, is that half of Israel's seriously ill patients who are currently hospitalized were fully vaccinated at least 5 months ago. Most of them are over 60 years old and have comorbidities. The seriously ill patients who are unvaccinated are mostly young, healthy people whose condition deteriorated quickly.

Israel's daily average number of infections has nearly doubled in the past 2 weeks and has increased around tenfold since mid-July [2021], approaching the numbers during Israel's peak in the winter. Deaths increased from 5 in June [2021] to at least 248 so far this month [August 2021]. Health officials say that currently 600 seriously ill patients are hospitalized, and they warn they cannot handle more than 1000 serious infections at the same time.

4. Israel's high vaccination rate isn't high enough.
The country jumped out ahead of all other countries on vaccines, and 78% of eligible Israelis over 12 years old are vaccinated.

But Israel has a young population, with many under the eligible age for vaccination, and about 1.1 million eligible Israelis, largely between the ages of 12 and 20, have declined to take even one dose of the vaccine.

That means only 58% of Israel's total citizenry is fully vaccinated. Experts say that's not nearly high enough.

"We have a very large fraction of our population who are paying the price for a small fraction of the population who did not go to get the vaccine," said Eran Segal of the Weizmann Institute of Science, who advises the Israeli government on COVID-19.

Unvaccinated people helped fuel the rapid spread of the virus while the country remained open for business in recent months with few serious restrictions.

"That will lead to mass infection, which is exactly what we are seeing now," said Segal.

5. Vaccinations are key, but they are not enough.
Israel is trying to slow the wave without resorting to a new lockdown, which Prime Minister Naftali Bennett says would take an economic toll and "destroy the future of the country." The country is placing caps on gatherings, increasing hospital staff, and pleading for unvaccinated people to get immunized.

On Israel's doorstep, the vaccination rate is much lower in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Only around 8% of Palestinians have been fully vaccinated. Palestinians are wary of certain brands of vaccine in ample supply, like AstraZeneca's, while Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine is in shorter supply for Palestinians. But the Palestinian population is not a source of transmission in Israel. Only vaccinated Palestinians are given permits to enter Israel and Israeli settlements.

As for the low rate of vaccination in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, "we don't have a shortage of vaccine. It is the hesitancy," said Randa Abu Rabe, a local World Health Organization official working in the Palestinian territories.

6. Booster shots offer more protection, if you are one of the world's lucky few to get them.
Israel is the 1st country to offer a 3rd shot of the Pfizer vaccine in a nationwide booster campaign. Preliminary research in Israel suggests booster shots significantly increase protection against the coronavirus a week after a person receives the 3rd dose.

Israeli national HMO Maccabi Healthcare Services, which conducted the preliminary study of 149 144 Israelis who received 3 Pfizer shots, said for Israelis above age 60, a Pfizer booster shot reduced the chances of infection by 86% and reduced the chances of severe infection by 92%.

The early data reflects studies by vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna and provides a glimpse at boosters' effects in a real-world setting.

After reviewing data on breakthrough infections in Israel, the US announced a booster shot campaign beginning in late September [2021] for anyone 8 months after their 2nd shot. The UK has promised boosters soon, and Turkey is offering Pfizer shots to those immunized with the Sinovac vaccine to help citizens planning to travel, since some countries will not recognize the Chinese vaccine.

Israel has lowered the minimum age for boosters to 40. "The triple dose is the solution to curbing the current infection outbreak," Anat Ekka Zohar of Maccabi said in a statement.

Boosters are not being offered in the Palestinian territories yet, and the World Health Organization has called on countries to stop giving COVID-19 booster shots in order to help poorer countries get vaccinated.

"Israel very much respects the World Health Organization but acts according to local considerations and the interests of Israeli citizens. We help the world a lot," an Israeli health official told NPR, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the issue. "If the UN didn't secure enough vaccines for Chad, Mali, Myanmar, and Guatemala, that doesn't mean that Israel shouldn't seek to prevent a pandemic from happening here."

Experts warn if countries do not vaccinate their populations, more variants will develop, threatening even vaccinated nations.

Looming question: Will we need COVID-19 vaccines every several months? We don't know.

The Cinema City movie theater complex in Jerusalem teems with young children and parents, but steps from the box office is a makeshift vaccination station where dozens of mostly older residents wait their turn to get booster shots.

More than a million Israelis have received a Pfizer booster shot in the last several weeks. They are being watched around the world, as Israel is the 1st nation to give a 3rd dose of Pfizer on a mass scale, just as it was ahead of the curve on the 1st round of shots.

"They make the test of us," said Etti Ben Yaakov, sitting in a vaccination booth with her brother as he got a booster shot. "But in the 1st [round], it was the same. So I don't feel it's something wrong. I think it's good."

She predicts the coronavirus, like the flu, will mean shots every year. "We will have to live with the corona," she said.

Ido Hadari, of HMO Maccabi, which led the preliminary booster shot study, questioned whether regular shots will become the norm.

"I don't know of any disease where we are vaccinated every 6 months, and to be honest, I don't think the public will come to get vaccinated every 6 months," Hadari said. "But you cannot predict anything with this disease.

[In the past 24 hours, 16 countries including the USA (120 698), UK (31 783), India (31 728), Brazil (28 388), Japan (24 955), Iran (24 179), Malaysia (22 262), France (22 636), Russia (21 000), Mexico (20 307), Turkey (19 351), Thailand (19 014), Indonesia (16 744), Philippines (16 251), Kazakhstan (13 842), Viet Nam (13 439), and South Africa (13 261) have reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 9139 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 19 Aug 2021 to late 20 Aug 2021). A total of 58 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 30 of the 58 countries are from the European region, 8 are from the Americas region, 7 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 4 are from the South East Asia region, 5 are from the Western Pacific region, and 4 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 2.1%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 3.6%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show an 18.3% increase in daily reported cases and 66.2 % increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 600 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 212.16 million cumulative reported cases and over 4.43 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
