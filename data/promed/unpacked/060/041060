According to media news articles on 22 Apr 2021 [see source URLs below], Hong Kong's Center for Health Protection (CHP) reported in their avian influenza update a human case of avian influenza A (H9N2). The case is a 3-year-old boy reported on 2 Apr 2021.

In most human cases of H9N2 avian influenza, the associated disease symptoms have been mild, and there has been no evidence of human-to-human transmission.

The 1st case was in a 10-year-old boy from Sanming, Fujian Province. The child had onset on 28 Jan 2020 and was reported on 16 Apr 2021. The 2nd case is a 2-year-old female from Shiyan, Hubei Province, China with illness onset on 7 Feb 2021. Both cases had mild illness and have recovered. The case from Hubei Province had exposure to backyard poultry, while no history of exposure was reported for the case from Fujian Province. So far, no family clusters have been reported.

To date, 12 cases of avian influenza A(H9N2) have been reported in the Western Pacific Region in 2021, and a total of 53 cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) have been reported in the Western Pacific Region since December 2015, primarily from China.

It's worth mentioning that influenza A(H9N2) viruses are enzootic in poultry populations in parts of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. Most human cases are exposed to the A(H9N2) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments. Human infection tends to result in mild clinical illness.

Avian H9N2 influenza A virus has caused repeated human infections in Asia since 1998. An H9N2 influenza virus infected a 5-year-old child in Hong Kong in 2003. The human H9N2 influenza virus, A/Hong Kong/2108/03, is of purely avian origin and is closely related to some viruses circulating in poultry in the markets of Hong Kong. The continued presence of H9N2 influenza viruses in poultry markets in southern China increases the likelihood of avian-to-human interspecies transmission. Since the mid-1990s, 2 lineages of H9N2 influenza A viruses have become established in domestic poultry in southern China, Duck/HK/Y280/97 (Y280-like) and Quail/HK/G1/97 (G1-like) viruses, which are predominantly found in chickens and quail, respectively (2, 3). These viruses have been sporadically introduced into humans and cause a flu-like illness (4, 5, 7, 16, 21). In the meantime, H9N2 influenza Y280-like viruses were also isolated from domestic pigs in Hong Kong in 1998 (20). These findings indicate that the interspecies transmission of H9N2 influenza virus from avian to mammalian hosts continues to occur and poses a persistent threat for humans.

[The WHO weekly avian influenza update no. 788 dated 16 Apr 2021 notes: "To date, 12 cases of avian influenza A(H9N2) have been reported in the Western Pacific Region in 2021, and a total of 53 cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) have been reported in the Western Pacific Region since December 2015" (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/wpro---documents/emergency/surveillance/avian-influenza/ai-20210416.pdf?sfvrsn=30d65594_120).

"H9N2 avian influenza viruses have become globally widespread in poultry over the last 2 decades and represent a genuine threat both to the global poultry industry but also humans through their high rates of zoonotic infection and pandemic potential. H9N2 viruses are generally hyperendemic in affected countries and have been found in poultry in many new regions in recent years."

Studies have reported how "reassortants between H9N2 viruses and human seasonal influenza viruses are able to efficiently transmit between ferrets, and there is, therefore, a real danger eventually such a reassortant could emerge in the field."

"Several H9N2 viruses have human receptor binding, pH stable HA proteins that could potentially allow efficient transmission between humans, whilst other H9N2 viruses contain internal gene cassettes that allow extremely efficient replication in humans (i.e., genotype 57). Overall, there is a clear risk of both inter-subtypic H9N2/human influenza virus reassortant emergence as well as an intra-subtyptic human binding HA/efficient mammalian polymerase reassortant emergence, either of which could potentially pose a high zoonotic and pandemic threat" (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6669617/). - Mod.UBA
