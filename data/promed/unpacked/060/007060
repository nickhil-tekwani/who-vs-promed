DENGUE/DHF UPDATE 2004 (35): China

I agree with [the moderator's comment in the previous update -- see most
recent reference below]: the rapid control of the Cixi epidemic is
remarkable. Besides the explanations already mentioned, the climatic
conditions also should be taken into account.
I do not know how far north Zhejiang province is, but if it has a
semi-temperate climate, it could be that the decreasing temperatures in
October helped a lot in controlling dengue fever. Below a certain
temperature, the reduced activity of the vector(s?), and even more the
extension of the extrinsic incubation make virus transmission much more
difficult.
We had this type of situation here in New Caledonia (French territory,
South Pacific, Latitude 22 deg south) in 2002 when, following several
imported cases of dengue type 1 from Polynesia, an outbreak of locally
acquired dengue was stopped after only 60 or so cases in May (beginning of
the "cool" season in the southern hemisphere). Noumea, the main city where
most of these cases occurred, has a population of about 80 000 people.

[Zhejiang is a coastal province with a monsoon climate; Cixi is a boom town
situated across an estuary south of Shanghai. A Google search shows the
minimum average temperature in October to be 58F:

So temperature could well be the explanation. - Mod.JW]
[After years of absence dengue was recorded in China in 1978; since then
epidemics have occurred in Guangxi and Guangdong provinces and on Hainan
island [and this year in Fujian province]. Both _Aedes aegypti_ and
_Aedes albopictus_ are known vectors of dengue in China, with the former
species being regarded as the more efficient. However, _Ae. aegypti_ is
mainly restricted to coastal areas south of a latitude of about 22
degrees, while _Ae. albopictus_ has a more widespread distribution and
appears to be the main vector in inland localities. But in some areas both
species can be vectors, such as on Hainan island.
Although there is no information on the vector in the city of Cixi,
Zhejiang, if local transmission was responsible for the recorded dengue
cases then it would appear that the vector might be _Ae.
albopictus_. However, more information is needed on any vector
identification made by the authorities in Cixi, and what anti-mosquito
control operations, if any, were employed. - Mod.MS]
