Philippines
- Pangasinan. 21 May 2020. The Provincial Health Office (PHO) recorded 935 dengue cases from [1 Jan-18 May 2020] with 9 mortalities. Although the total number of cases is lower than the 1133 recorded last year [2019] in the same period, the number of deaths is higher than last year with only 2," PHO chief, Dr Anna Ma Teresa de Guzman said in a radio interview on Thursday [21 May 2020]. She said the mortalities may be attributed to the community quarantine when the mobility of people is limited and access to transportation is restricted.
De Guzman said Pangasinan now has a limited supply of blood bags in different blood banks in the province as there are few donors, while organizing bloodletting activities is a challenge in this time of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic when mass gatherings are not allowed.
De Guzman reiterated the need to keep the surroundings clean to prevent breeding grounds for mosquitoes, especially with the onset of the rainy season. Among the areas closely monitored by PHO for the high number of dengue cases are San Carlos City, Bugallon, Sta Barbara, Mangaldan, and Binmaley.

Pacific
- Fiji and Marshall Islands. 19 May 2020. As the Pacific Islands battle to keep COVID-19 out and continues to reel from the aftermath of the Tropical Cyclone Harold, they are fighting another battle; dengue fever. More than 3000 cases of dengue fever have been reported in both Fiji and the Marshall Islands, but several more islands are at risk.
There are now 700 confirmed cases of dengue fever in areas of Fiji that were most affected by Tropical Cyclone Harold. The majority of new cases are children under the age of 18.
As of [6 May 2020], the Marshall Islands has reported more than 1360 cases of dengue-like illness, of which more than 1560 have been laboratory confirmed.
This situation is coupled with a shortage of safe water, which increases the health risks to displaced people, not only from dengue fever but also from other waterborne and mosquito-spread diseases. If COVID-19 entered these evacuation centres, it could also create an increased risk of spread, as lack of hygiene also facilitates the transmission of COVID-19.
Following the 1st confirmed COVID-19 case in Fiji, the Government responded immediately by isolating the person and carrying out thorough contact tracing, as well as tightening its national and international travel. The Marshall Islands dengue fever outbreak began in July 2019 and is considered the worst outbreak in the country's history.
