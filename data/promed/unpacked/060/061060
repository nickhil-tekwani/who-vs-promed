AFLATOXIN - SOMALIA: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

November 1997- January 1998 we had major floods in Somalia, underground
grain stores were all under water for weeks. Now the crop is failing and
people have started eating what remains out of the partially/fully spoiled
sorghum, visible fungus growth according to field information.
Simultaneously reports about the increasing number of kwashiorkor
[protein-calorie malnutrition] cases are coming from the field. Is it
possible that we are dealing with aflatoxin induced kwashiorkor?
What could be done, except telling people not to eat spoilt grain? Not a
very practical solution, when you do not have much choice. We can only
provide for a small number of clearly malnourished children.
Does anyone have any practical answers to how to best to deal with spoiled
grain (sorghum mainly)?
Does any form of practical field treatment substantially reduce the levels
of aflatoxin and other mycotoxins?
Could members who know of food toxicologists/mycologists who might be able
to offer an opinion please pass this message on so that we can get some
authoritative response. Clearly this is urgent and the correct advice
needs to be transmitted to the field in order to prevent many cases of
mycotoxicosis on the one hand or starvation on the other.
This dilemma of whether or not to eat visibly fungus infested food is so
common in much of the world that we would all like to know what to do when
there is no alternative but to eat the food!
