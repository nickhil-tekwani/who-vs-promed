Bird flu crisis not over, warn UN agencies
------------------------------------------
United Nations agencies warned Asian countries on Fri, 19 Mar 2004 to
be cautious about declaring victory over the deadly outbreak of avian
flu across the continent, saying it was still not under control.
"The crisis is still not over," warned the Food and Agriculture
Organisation (FAO) and World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) in
a joint statement.
Viet Nam, where 15 people have died from the disease, says it has
"basically" brought the epidemic under control and will officially
declare that it has been eradicated on 30 Mar 2004.
The agencies said the situation had "improved" in Viet Nam, as well
as in China and Thailand, where 8 people have died. And they said
further outbreaks could still flare up in countries like Indonesia,
Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand.
"The virus could spread again within and between countries. As long
as the H5N1 virus is not fully under control, the potential threat to
human health remains."
According to OIE international standards, countries can claim to be
free from avian influenza under certain conditions and, in any case 6
months after the occurrence of the last outbreak. The organisations
called for further investigation into how the epidemic started. "To
avoid future outbreaks, we need a clear understanding of how the
disease began."
To date, at least 100 million birds have died or have been culled to
control the disease.

Japan, South Korean bird flu virus almost identical
-----------------------------------------------------
Research by a Japanese institute shows that the gene sequence of the
bird flu virus found in Japan and that found in South Korea are
virtually the same, the Agriculture Ministry said on Friday.
Japan's National Institute of Animal Health studied the viruses found
in one outbreak in South Korea in early December 2003 and 4 in Japan,
a ministry official said.
Japan confirmed its 1st case of bird flu in nearly 80 years in
January 2004 in the southwestern tip of the country's main island of
Honshu.
The ministry said in a statement that the study showed that the gene
sequences of the viruses, determined as the H5N1 strain, matched by
more than 99 percent.
Many international experts believe that the virus, which has spread
through many parts of Asia, was carried by migratory birds or wild
fowl, but the ministry official said it was not possible to point to
the origin of the Japanese virus, based on the study.
"It is not possible to conclude from these results alone that the
origin of the virus found in our country is South Korea," the
ministry said in a news release. He said the ministry planned to set
up a panel of experts to try to trace the root of the outbreak in
Japan.
An earlier study by the same institute showed that the gene sequence
of the virus found in Japan was not the same as that of the virus
found in Viet Nam, which has been blamed for the deaths of at least
15 humans there since avian influenza struck in January 2004.
The gene sequence does not match that of the bird flu virus that
caused human deaths in Hong Kong in 1997, the earlier study also
showed.
Bird flu has killed 8 people in Thailand.

China's migrating fowl complicate efforts to control bird flu
---------------------------------------------------
From atop a centuries-old dike, high above the mud flats of China's
biggest lake, the view is one of utter tranquility. A heron drifts
by. Warblers dart through bushes. White-fronted geese splash and dive
in ponds.
This wetland, hanging like a pouch from the Yangtze River's middle
reaches, is one of Asia's most important habitats for migrating
birds. But it is also lined with water buffalo pasture, duck farms,
and waist-deep ponds and canals where people fish with nets.
This cheek-by-jowl life around the 4000-square-kilometer
(1600-square-mile) lake illustrates how difficult it can be to keep
wild birds, people, and domestic poultry from mixing and spreading
infectious diseases like bird flu.
The role wildfowl have played in the current outbreak of bird flu
remains a mystery. Some experts believe migratory birds may be the
source of the deadly strain of avian flu that has jumped to humans in
2004, killing 23 people in Thailand and Viet Nam and the
precautionary slaughter of millions of fowl in 10 Asian countries.
Others contend the few wild birds known to have gotten the virus were
likely victims of diseased domestic poultry.
"There are certainly other causes for spreading the disease, such as
the trade and sales of live birds, day-old chicks, and eggs," said
Jeff Gilbert, a zoologist with the World Health Organization in
Beijing. "Do not assume in every case that it's wild birds."
Still, with experts warning that flu outbreaks could spark a global
pandemic, officials in the region are adopting a safe-not-sorry
approach and trying to prevent further outbreaks.
"We're keeping a close watch on waterfowl in southern China, since
the climate is wet and warm there and the virus can spread easily,"
said Wei Rong, an official at the government headquarters for
preventing bird flu.
Teams of researchers from the government-run Chinese Academy of
Sciences are in the field hunting for the source of 2004's outbreak
and for ways to limit the future risk from migratory birds.
In Japan, experts began investigating after several crows were found
infected with bird flu. They fear the birds -- aggressive,
garbage-devouring pests in urban and rural areas -- could somehow
pass the virus to humans.
"This is a major problem," said Hiroyuki Higuchi, a professor at
Tokyo University.
Japan has also sent researchers to South Korea to discuss concerns
over migratory birds.
"All over the world, they're loaded with viruses," said Graeme Laver,
an Australian flu expert who has found influenza in many bird
species, even on isolated islands of the Great Barrier Reef. "The
only thing we can do is to recommend keeping poultry away from wild
birds. But that's very difficult."
Keeping wild and domestic birds apart is a daunting prospect in
China, where the watery southern landscape is ideally suited for
raising flocks of ducks and geese.
Traveling along migration corridors stretching from Siberia to New
Zealand, wild birds sometimes contract mild cases of bird flu and
carry the virus long distances.
Their droppings spread the germs into waterways used by domestic
fowl, or dry up and drift through the air breathed by the
free-ranging chickens that account for 2/3 of all poultry in China.
In February, authorities banned bird watching and photography in
Poyang's nature reserves. But those restrictions apply only to the
lake's formally designated conservation reserves.
So far, no cases of bird flu have been reported among wild birds
around the lake, although some were confirmed on farms near the
provincial capital of Nanchang, just an hour's drive south.
Dry weather may have helped. The lake is at its lowest in 2 decades,
so many migrating fowl have stayed far from farms -- well within the
vast mud flats that rim the lake, filling only during the flood
season. High dikes protect lowland farms from flooding.
In rural China, farmers often live in close quarters with pigs and
poultry, an arrangement experts say is ideal for nurturing infectious
diseases, particularly the flu. 2003's outbreak of SARS, severe acute
respiratory syndrome, has also been linked to wild animals.
Bird flu was first identified in Italy about 130 years ago. The first
known cases of it jumping directly to humans were in 1997 in Hong
Kong, when a strain similar to that found in the current outbreak
killed 6 people. The territory ended that outbreak by slaughtering
all its poultry.
Most avian flu outbreaks are short-lived and sporadic, and few of the
viruses seem to have mutated into forms deadly to humans. In recent
years, though, the number of cases has soared as poultry flocks have
expanded and trade in grown birds, chicks, and eggs has boomed.
Allowed to spread among domestic poultry, mild bird flu strains have
mutated into killer varieties that can wipe out entire commercial
flocks -- and even wildfowl.
During 2004's outbreak, bird flu has already killed black swans in
southern China. In Hong Kong, a falcon was discovered to have died of
the disease. Thai officials say some migratory birds found dead in
the country carried the avian virus.
"This virus is especially vicious. It's killing wild birds that
normally wouldn't get sick," said Laver.
Martin Williams, a writer and bird watcher based in Hong Kong,
contends the spread of avian flu this winter does not match migration
patterns -- another factor that implicates poultry farming.
While wild birds may harbor the flu, they can also provide clues to
its prevention. In a discovery Laver calls "sheer luck," his research
identified a "neuraminidase," or viral protein, in influenza germs
taken from a noddy tern caught on the Great Barrier Reef.
Crystals sent into space and cultivated from that protein were used
to develop the antiinfluenza drug Tamiflu, one of humankind's few
defenses against the virus.

WHO warns Viet Nam about bird flu
--------------------------------
A World Health Organisation (WHO) epidemic disease expert Fri (19 Mar
2004) urged Vietnam to maintain its vigilance against bird flu.
"The main risk is that as long as there continues to be avian
influenza in the region, there is still the potential for outbreaks,"
said epidemiologist Dr Richard Brown, head of a special outbreak
response team set up jointly by the WHO and the Asian Development
Bank (ADB).
"For this reason, countries need to strengthen surveillance, maintain
vigilance, and have robust contingency plans ready." Brown, who is
helping the Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City examine the issues
arising from the disease, said there was a danger of more outbreaks
if chicken farms are repopulated too soon.
"As long as there are sick animals, there is the possibility of human
cases or a new form of the virus," he said in a statement. Brown is
one of a team of 4 WHO health experts funded by the ADB and based at
WHO's Western Pacific Regional Office in Manila . Outbreaks of the
highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of avian influenza have been detected
in 57 out of Viet Nam's 64 provinces and cities since the beginning
of the year, resulting in the deaths or culling of more than 38
million birds.
15 people have died from the disease, making it in human terms the
worst-affected of the 8 Asian countries where H5N1 has been detected.
8 people have died in Thailand. The Vietnamese government says it has
"basically" brought the epidemic under control and will officially
declare that it has been eradicated on 30 Mar 2004.
However, the Food and Agriculture Organisation has also warned that
Viet Nam is not yet clear of bird flu and should not rush to
replenish its poultry stocks. Anton Rychener, head of the UN agency's
operations in the communist nation, said last week he was worried
that Hanoi may be sweeping the disease under the carpet.
"Information sharing between the international community and the
Vietnamese government has been less than satisfactory over the past
month," he said. Besides Vietnam and Thailand , H5N1 infections have
also broken out in Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, and South
Korea.
