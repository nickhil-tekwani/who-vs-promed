A total of 188 cases of measles were confirmed in England with onset in May 2013, making a total of 1168 cases since the start of the year [2013]. This is the lowest monthly total recorded since November 2012 and follows a prolonged period with monthly figures around the highest recorded levels since enhanced surveillance commenced in 1994. The North East and North West regions continue to report the highest number of cases, followed by London. The age group most affected in May 2013 was 10-14 year olds (52/188, 28 percent), consistent with a shift towards this age group when compared to the previous 4 years.

Amongst cases this year [2013], 231 (20 percent) were associated with secondary school outbreaks. Small outbreaks have also been reported from "hard-to-reach" populations with known low coverage such as the travelling community and the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in north London. Overall, 230 (20 percent) of all cases in 2013 were admitted to hospital, of which 35 reported complications including pneumonia, meningitis and gastroenteritis.

Most of the cases in May 2013 that have been genotyped have been shown to be MVs/Taunton.GBR/27.12/[D8], which has been circulating in England since July 2012.

As previously reported, the shift towards secondary school age groups in 2013 is likely to be explained by the fall in coverage of MMR that occurred between 1999 and 2005. To reduce the risk of larger outbreaks of measles in the next academic year, Public Health England, the Department of Health and NHS England announced an MMR catch-up programme in late April 2013. The campaign has targeted children aged between 10 and 16 years who have a record of none or incomplete MMR vaccination. Returns from the NHS Areas Teams confirm that almost 5000 practices have already signed up to participate in the programme. The service involves sending letters from general practices inviting under-vaccinated children to attend the surgery for vaccination. The primary target population was the estimated 8 percent of that age group (around 300 000 individuals) who had received no vaccine. Secondary targets included a similar number of children in that age group who had received one dose of MMR and a similar number of under-vaccinated individuals in other age groups.

Around 200 000 extra doses have been ordered, and preliminary data from 1276 practices (around 16 percent of the total for England) suggests that the percentage of children in this age group with no record of having received MMR has declined by around 1.3 percent. This is consistent with a national reduction in the total of unvaccinated 10-16 years olds of around 56 000, although data from a larger number of practices is awaited. If this increase was to be replicated nationally, this would represent about half the estimated number of vaccinations required to reach the campaign objective of ensuring that at least 95 percent of 10-16 year olds had received at least one dose of MMR. In addition, the number of children recorded as partially vaccinated has fallen by a similar proportion. Although most vaccination has been conducted in primary care, school campaigns have been conducted in response to local outbreaks and are being planned for the next school year in many areas to ensure as many children as possible are vaccinated.

The rate that measles is spreading across the North East has started to decline, according to the latest figures.

Monthly data show 43 cases of the preventable, infectious disease were reported in May 2013 compared to 112 in April 2013, which suggests the rate of increase may be declining. However, the latest data takes the North East total for 2013 at the end of May 2013 to 368, which compares to only 2 confirmed cases reported during the same period last year [2012]. Middlesbrough remains the worst affected area with 19 of the 43 new cases being people from the town.

The report estimates that there are thousands of young people aged between 10 and 16 who remain unvaccinated, and measures will remain in place to target the "priority group." Dr Roberta Marshall, director of the North East Public Health England Centre, said: "Thanks to the hard work of local health teams, we are making good progress towards the 95 per cent target, but there still remains a large number of 10-16 year olds, together with many younger children and young adults, who are under-vaccinated.

Cases of measles in the borough have finally been brought down to national average levels after months of concern.

There were only 7 new cases confirmed in June 2013 in the borough, bringing it in line with the expected number of cases for the time of year. At its peak in March and April 2013, there were around 10 cases being diagnosed every week in the borough, but thanks to extra vaccinations being introduced across the borough, health chiefs say the virus is now under control.

Health bosses put on extra MMR immunisation sessions provided by the School Health Service at 6 high schools that had the highest number of children not immunised with the triple jab vaccine. Dr Paul Turner, Wigan Council consultant in Public Health, said: "The observed reduction in confirmed cases of measles is most welcome and is a testament to the hard work by the local School Health Service and General Practices during the last 2 months.

"It is likely that the number of cases of measles will continue to fall as we enter the school holiday period. However, this is no reason to be complacent as the measles virus has not gone away, and when children return to school after the holiday period, the number of cases may increase again, particularly in unimmunised and partially immunised children. I urge parents of school age children that have never had the MMR vaccine or have had only one dose, to take advantage of the holiday period to arrange with their general practice to get them fully immunised with 2 doses of MMR vaccine. "Not immunising your children leaves them with a lifelong risk of developing measles.

"I also urge people who work with children to be sure that they are protected against measles. Not only will this mean you do not catch measles, but you will also be protecting the children with whom you work. This is particularly important if you are a child minder or work in a nursery where there are children under the age of 12 months that will not have received their 1st scheduled dose of MMR vaccine."

Watchdog Health Protection Scotland confirmed that Tayside and Fife are at the centre of a 19-strong "cluster" of confirmed measles cases. NHS Tayside has also reported 7 additional cases of the "sometimes fatal" disease in the local area. These numbers account for more than half of the confirmed 48 measles cases in Scotland since January [2013]. The board's health protection team has been sending out letters to people who have had contact with confirmed sufferers warning them to check their vaccination history and to be on the lookout for symptoms. The number of measles cases across the country is on the rise, with 3 times as many suspected cases reported this year [2013] as there were over the same period in 2012. The "ongoing" outbreak, which so far has infected at least 19 people, is within a Travelling [Roma] group that has been moving around Tayside and Fife.

A Health Protection Scotland report, which analysed all confirmed and suspected measles cases in the 1st 6 months of 2013, said: "There were 3 clusters of cases. One cluster -- 19 laboratory confirmed and one probable case -- occurred in the traveller community in Fife and Tayside and is ongoing." The locations of the 2 other Scottish clusters, the 1st consisting of 6 confirmed cases and the 2nd of 2 confirmed cases, was not identified. However, the outbreaks were revealed to have been in a healthcare setting and a school.

In a notification letter, NHS Tayside's Dr Daniel Chandler said people can develop symptoms as long as 21 days after the initial exposure period. The consultant in public health medicine said: "Measles is a viral infection that can spread very easily from person to person. People are infectious for 5 days before the rash appears, and so people can pass on the infection before they realise they have measles." Uptake of the MMR vaccine in Tayside is slightly higher than the Scottish average, with some 95.4 percent of 2 year olds having had the inoculation.

116 new cases of measles have been reported in the last 24 hours, bringing the total to 21 710 in the province [Punjab]. According to Health Department officials, at least 185 deaths have been reported so far, mostly in Lahore, Gujranwala, Rajanpur, Rahim Yar Khan, Silakot, Faisalabad and Kasur. 17 of the new cases were reported in Lahore's hospitals.

Meanwhile, anti-measles drive focal person Dr Younas stated that the people have responded very positively to the government's anti-measles teams. Many parents contacted the camps themselves to get their children vaccinated. He said that measles vaccination was readily available at all hospitals in the city, and patients were being treated for free. He hoped that the measles epidemic would start receding soon.

Dr. Bob Nosal, Halton's Medical Officer of Health, says another case of measles has been identified, bringing the region's recent total to 5. He said the latest case is in Oakville, and it's believed the patient came in contact with the disease at a health-care location. Nosal said the 1st 3 cases involved Burlington children from the same family, while the 2 latest cases are adults.

He said since the disease is more commonly passed among children, he had hoped it would have been the end of the outbreak. His concern now is that the latest patient may have exposed a number of people to the disease during a shopping trip to the Target store at Burlington Mall on 6 Jul 2013 between noon and 3 p.m. "We wouldn't be issuing a news release if we knew we could get the information out there to everyone who may have come in contact with it," Nosal said. Nosal said the patient also visited the Freshco store at 2501 3rd Line in Oakville on the morning of 6 Jul 2013 and then attended mass at St. Paul the Apostle Roman Catholic Church in Burlington on Sun 7 Jul 2013 at 8 p.m.

Children and adults who have been properly vaccinated for measles should have no concern, Nosal added. "In this day and age, we shouldn't be seeing measles," Nosal explained. "When we do see it, we act very aggressively. It's a very communicable disease." The Halton health department is asking anyone who fears they may have measles to call in advance to a doctor's office, walk-in clinic or emergency department in an effort to limit any exposure to staff and other patients.

A measles outbreak in 2 more British Columbia communities could be a sign of more cases to come, says a medical health officer who is urging parents to get their children vaccinated.

Dr. Paul Martiquet of the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority said on Fri 12 Jul 2013 that he's concerned that 8 cases of the highly contagious disease have been confirmed in the province since mid-June 2013. "It's been 3 years since we have seen measles (in B.C.)," he said. Martiquet said one in every 3000 Canadians with measles dies of the infection.

He said the 4 cases identified this week in Whistler and Pemberton are not linked to the 4 cases diagnosed in Bowen Island and the North Shore last month [June 2013], raising questions about the outbreak's origins. "It is possible that it's been brought in internationally, or it's possible that it's just been circulating in the community without us knowing," he said, adding it may be more likely that an overseas visitor to a tourism destination such as Whistler had the disease.

"This a wake-up call," Martiquet said. "Measles is a killer. It can be prevented by a safe and effective vaccine, and we are requesting parents -- especially with their newborns and infants -- to avail themselves to the childhood vaccine series for measles that starts at 12 months, and a 2nd dose at 18 months."

Officials recommend vaccinations for adults and for children over a year old if they not have received the 2 necessary doses. Anyone who has already had the infection is immune, and officials say adults born before 1970 are likely to be immune.

The last outbreak of measles in British Columbia was in 2010, when 70 cases were diagnosed following the Winter Olympics.
