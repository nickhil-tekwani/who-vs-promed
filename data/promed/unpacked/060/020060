Possible cases of the tick-borne illness Rocky Mountain spotted fever [RMSF] are being reported in St Louis County [Missouri]. KMOX Radio reports the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services has confirmed the 2 cases are being investigated. Details about the victims have not been released.

Rocky Mountain spotted fever can cause fever, headache, abdominal pain, vomiting, and muscle pain. It can be fatal in rare cases. The tick season is off to an early start because of unseasonably warm weather. It runs through September.

[These suspected cases are particularly noteworthy as it is quite early in the season to start seeing RMSF, which reflects the very mild winter and recent warmth facilitating better survival of overwintering ticks and earlier activity.

It is vital to diagnose this rickettsial infection promptly to minimize morbidity and mortality. This is particularly true in areas such as the midwestern USA, where the disease is uncommon. When the female tick harboring the organism attaches to a passing human, she usually starts low on the body after transferring from grassy vegetation or even directly or indirectly from a dog. After crawling around on clothes seeking an appropriate cutaneous site (wearing white clothes makes a wandering tick easier to spot), she attaches and begins to feed.

After attaching, it generally takes as many as 24 hours to activate and transmit the rickettsial organism. For this reason, daily or twice daily tick checks with removal will minimize disease transmission. Ticks that attach in hairy areas such as the scalp or beard may be more difficult to find.

Regarding the difficulty in removing a tick, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (http://www.cdc.gov/ticks/removing_a_tick.html) suggests:

"If you find a tick attached to your skin, there's no need to panic. There are several tick removal devices on the market, but a plain set of fine-tipped tweezers will remove a tick quite effectively.

"Use fine-tipped tweezers to grasp the tick as close to the skin's surface as possible. Pull upward with steady, even pressure. Don't twist or jerk the tick; this can cause the mouth-parts to break off and remain in the skin. If this happens, remove the mouth-parts with tweezers. If you are unable to remove the mouth easily with clean tweezers, leave it alone and let the skin heal.

"After removing the tick, thoroughly clean the bite area and your hands with rubbing alcohol, an iodine scrub, or soap and water."

The incubation period of the disease is about a week after the tick exposure, long after the tick has detached. The presenting illness is generally nonspecific, fever, muscle pains, headache (but the headache is usually described as quite severe). The rash begins in day 3 of illness, initially maculopapular at the wrists and ankles before becoming petechial and purpuric involving the palms and soles as well as spreading proximally to the truck. Purpura usually are not seen before the 6th day of illness. The mortality is indeed quite low if treatment (usually a tetracycline) is begun during the 1st 2 days of the rash or before.

Empiric treatment for this infection should always be begun in people with compatible symptoms inhabiting endemic areas during the spring and summer, even if no tick bite is known.

The female _Dermacentor variabilis_ (the American dog tick), a common vector for this infection, can be seen at http://bugguide.net/images/cache/3K9RLQWRIQTQU0L0P0K020H0P0Z020CQFKCRMQL0XQH0IQZ0U0R0W0Z0U0Q0IQTRIQOR7QYRP0JRXQS0G0OQX0VR.jpg.
