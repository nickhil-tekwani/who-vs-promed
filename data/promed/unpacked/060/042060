Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - update 26 Jun 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health (MOH) in Saudi Arabia has announced 7 additional laboratory-confirmed cases and a death in a previously confirmed case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

A total of 4 cases have been detected among contacts of confirmed cases in Riyadh and the Eastern Region. They range in age from 7 to 15 years, and all were asymptomatic. Also, 2 further asymptomatic cases have been recorded among female healthcare workers in the Eastern Region and Al-Ahsa. A 7th case has been detected in a 50-year-old female in the Eastern Region. She is currently hospitalized with pulmonary disease and her condition is considered stable.

In addition, the MoH has announced the death of a previously reported confirmed case from the Eastern Region (the 32-year-old male 1st reported on [23 Jun 2013]).

Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 77 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 40 deaths.

WHO has received reports of laboratory-confirmed cases originating in the following countries in the Middle East to date: Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). France, Germany, Italy, Tunisia and the United Kingdom also reported laboratory-confirmed cases; they were either transferred there for care of the disease or returned from the Middle East and subsequently became ill. In France, Italy, Tunisia and the United Kingdom, there has been limited local transmission among patients who had not been to the Middle East but had been in close contact with the laboratory-confirmed or probable cases.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. Specimens from patients' lower respiratory tracts should be obtained for diagnosis where possible. Clinicians are reminded that MERS-CoV infection should be considered even with atypical signs and symptoms, such as diarrhoea, in patients who are immunocompromised.

Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers and visitors.

All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

WHO continues to closely monitor the situation.

[This report includes the cases reported on the Saudi MOH website and included in the prior ProMED-mail post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (34): Saudi Arabia, WHO 20130624.1788112. As of 26 Jun 2013 there have been 77 laboratory confirmed infections with MERS-CoV including 40 deaths. Of note, this tally includes confirmation of infection in 6 asymptomatic contacts of confirmed clinically ill cases, of which 2 were health care workers.

In the prior ProMED-mail post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (31): Jordan, retro. case ID, WHO, RFI 20130617.1777989, there was a newswire announcing an additional 8 MERS-CoV infections out of 124 contacts of the 2 previously announced and confirmed cases involved in the April 2012 ICU associated cluster (see Novel coronavirus - Eastern Mediterranean: WHO, Jordan, conf., RFI 20121130.1432498 and Novel coronavirus - Saudi Arabia (04): RFI, Jordan, April 2012 20120925.1308001 for details on the Jordan April 2012 outbreak). The newswire announcement included a statement from a Jordanian MOH official of a serologic study done in collaboration with the US CDC. Of note, of the 8 serologically confirmed cases, 6 reportedly had clinical symptoms at the time of the outbreak and 2 were asymptomatic. As of today (26 Jun 2013), these 8 additional cases have not been added to the WHO global case tally. This moderator wonders if this relates to the testing procedure used (serologic testing).

[2] MERS-CoV meeting: WHO/EMRO (Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office)

Health officials meet to discuss urgent measures for control of novel coronavirus infection (MERS-CoV).

Meeting on MERS-CoV concludes with urgent call to improve surveillance and strengthen global health preparedness
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Over 100 health officials from the countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region as well as from France, Germany and the United Kingdom met in the WHO Regional Office in Cairo from [20 to 22 Jun 2013] and discussed a collective response plan to counter the threats of novel coronavirus infection to global health.

Dr Ala Alwan, WHO Regional Director for WHO Eastern Mediterranean, and Dr Keiji Fukuda, Assistant Director-General for Health Security and Environment, inaugurated this meeting, which was also attended by WHO staff from the Regional Offices for the Eastern Mediterranean and for Europe and WHO headquarters, as well as representatives of WHO collaborating centres and other key technical partners and networks that have been involved in the global response to MERS-CoV. The meeting discussed the public health threats related to the emergence of this virus, reviewed the current level of preparedness and response measures in the region as well as provided recommendations that can collectively improve and strengthen global public health preparedness against MERS-CoV.

The meeting recognized that 3 main epidemiological patterns of this novel virus have been observed so far.
- Sporadic cases in communities: At present, the source of the virus infection or how these people became infected remains unknown;
- Clusters of infections in families: In most of these clusters, there appears to be person-to-person transmission, but it seems that this transmission was limited to people who were in close contact with a sick family member;
- Clusters of infections in health care facilities: In these clusters, the sequence seems to be that an infected person was admitted to hospital where that person then transmitted the virus to other people in the health care facility.

The meeting acknowledged that despite no current evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, MERS-CoV may evolve to spread quickly among humans and affect wider geographical areas. While major knowledge gaps remain in understanding the emergence of this virus, clinical manifestations as well as the transmission risk, recent scientific research is enhancing the global knowledge on the disease. This new knowledge now needs to be translated into a set of concrete public health actions in order to improve global and regional public health preparedness.

The meeting also recognized that as much as collecting and sharing of full epidemiological, clinical, immunologic and virologic information related to MERS-CoV infections is essential for better understanding and characterization of the disease that will contribute to global preparedness against this novel infection, coordinated and inter-sectoral actions are also important to increase global, regional and inter-regional collaboration among countries, with WHO and other international health partners in responding to the outbreak caused by this novel virus.

The countries were also encouraged to improve surveillance for detection of any sign that signals sustained human-to-human transmission as well as participate in further development of diagnostic assays through international networking with technical agencies, sharing of materials and resources, and participation in laboratory studies.

The meeting identified a set of concrete public health action points that can collectively improve and strengthen global public health preparedness, surveillance and response to MERS-CoV.
