Over 100 tourists were hospitalized in Viet Nam with food poisoning
on Mon 19 Jun 2006, after eating seafood at a restaurant in the
central resort town of Nha Trang. Most had dizziness, headache,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and numbness of the limbs, with 20
suffering from cardiac arrest. They were part of a 600-strong
Vietnamese tour group organized by a company in Ho Chi Minh City. An
hour before they took ill, the group had soups and shrimp for dinner
at Trong Com restaurant.
Earlier this month [June 2006], 2 similar food poisoning cases
occurred in the city, with 68 tourists hospitalized, many of whom
said they had seafood at the same restaurant. A preliminary
investigation confirmed seafood to be the cause.

The food at a restaurant in Viet Nam that sent over 100 people to
hospital with food poisoning has been found to be lethal. The
bio-chemistry department at the central resort city of Nha Trang's
Oceanography Institute concluded that 2 of 5 food samples obtained
from a meal eaten by the victims on Mon 19 Jun 2006 could kill if
consumed in sufficient quantity.
Dao Viet Ha, the department's acting head said Wed 21 Jun 2006 that
samples of crab soup and prawns from the city's Trong Com restaurant
tested positive for Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP). 500 grams of
the soup (equaling 3 bowls) or 100 grams of the prawns (3 prawns)
could kill a healthy person.
The institute has asked the local police and health agencies to find
out the source of the crustaceans used in the 2 dishes. Local
authorities have closed the restaurant temporarily.
The victims -- 165 of them -- had to be hospitalized an hour after
having the crab soup and prawns at the restaurant.
Earlier this month [June 2006], 2 similar cases occurred in the

[There are a number of different types of shellfish poisoning.
Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), Neurologic shellfish poisoning
(NSP), Diarrheal shellfish poisoning (DSP), and Amnestic shellfish
poisoning (ASP). Often, these are all grouped collectively as
paralytic shellfish poisoning. And perhaps there is a basis for this
grouping in that the 4 syndromes are primarily associated with
mollusks, (mussels, clams, oysters).
Clearly then, the syndrome is not associated with crabs and prawns,
as reported here.
Since the toxins responsible for these are water-soluble, heat and
acid-stable, and are not inactivated by ordinary cooking methods, it
would cause one to wonder whether the soup stocks were made from mollusks.
PSP has been known to have a death rate of 1-12 percent. The latency
period between ingestion and clinical signs is generally about half
an hour. This article indicates that the victims consumed the soup
approximately an hour prior to the signs of illness.
The clinical signs of PSP include paresthesias of the lips, tongue,
and gums, rapidly progressing to involve the distal extremities.
Headaches, ataxia, muscle weakness, paralysis, and cranial nerve
dysfunction have also been reported. Gastrointestinal signs such as
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhea are less common.
Generally, fatalities occur within the 1st 12 hours of clinical
signs, and death is usually from respiratory failure. PSP usually
lasts 3 days, but muscle weakness may persist for weeks.
Cardiac arrest is not generally associated with PSP. However, the
article does not tell us the age or possibly other underlying health
conditions of these people. It may be that the stress and worry of
this illness could exacerbate any current cardiac issues.
Bradycardia is not a common sign is seen with NSP. Since PSP and NSP
are not associated with prawns and crabs, it leaves one suspicious of
what else was in the soup or the soup stock. - Mod.TG]
