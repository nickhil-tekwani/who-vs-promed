A tuna dish was today [5 Dec 2008] identified as the source of an illness
which led to 12 business delegates being rushed to hospital. Six men and 6
women fell ill after eating the dish at the Aberdeen Exhibition and
Conference Centre yesterday [4 Dec 2008].

Ten of the patients were allowed to leave Aberdeen Royal Infirmary on the
day of the incident, and the remaining 2 were discharged today [5 Dec
2008]. The incident occurred in the Gallery Restaurant, which is only open
to business people and not the wider public. It was investigated by NHS
Grampian's public health department, along with the city council's
environmental health department, and Health Protection Scotland.

A spokesman for NHS Grampian said: "The common link between the 12 patients
affected yesterday [4 Dec 2008] is the tuna dish consumed for lunch.
Samples have been sent for laboratory testing, but high levels of a
naturally occurring compound known as histamine can cause the symptoms
displayed by the patients.

"The city's environmental health department are continuing to investigate,
but there is no evidence of any food handling fault in the UK. It is
extremely unlikely any of this batch of tuna remains in circulation."

[How many individuals ate the tuna is not stated so the attack rate of this
entity is not clear.

Scombroid fish poisoning occurs after eating fish with high levels of
accumulated histamine or other biogenic amines. Histamine is produced and
can accumulate when bacterial enzymes metabolize naturally occurring
histidine in fish. This most often occurs when fish is held at ambient or
high temperatures (such as 70 to 90 deg F / 21.1 to 32.2 deg C) for several
hours, but can occur at more moderate temperatures (over 45 deg F or over
7.2 deg C). Rapid chilling of fish immediately after catch is the most
effective measure to prevent scombroid fish poisoning. Fish from the family
_Scombridae_ (such as tuna and mackerel) contain high levels of free
histidine in muscle tissue and are the commonest sources of scombroid fish
poisoning, but other fish (such as mahi mahi, amberjack, bluefish, abalone,
and sardines) also have been implicated.

It should be noted that those taking isoniazid (INH) might have more
significant reactions because of the drug's histaminase inhibition in the
GI tract. (See: Miki M, Ishiwara T, Okayamai H. An outbreak of histamine
poisoning after ingestion of the ground saury paste in 8 patients taking
isoniazid in tuberculous ward. Internal Medicine 2005; 44: 1133-6
