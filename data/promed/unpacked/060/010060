HFMD kills more than 9 infants in China's province
--------------------------------------------------
More than 9 infants have died of the contagious hand-foot-mouth
disease (HFMD) since the beginning of the year [2009] in eastern
China's Shandong province, as health officials Friday [3 Apr 2009]
ordered emergency medical teams to inspect hundreds of villages in
the region, reports say.

The latest victims died Wednesday [1 Apr 2009] in Heze city, where no
fatalities from the disease were reported last year [2008]. The
emergency inspections will cover 600 villages under Heze's
jurisdiction, the city's health bureau said in a statement.

Out of the 7632 children infected by the disease in the province,
Heze registered 7 deaths from the disease and Jining City 2. Heze has
launched a major disinfection campaign, particularly in rural areas,
by supplying more medical equipment for 2 key hospitals and the
training of medical staff in disease-control. Meanwhile, the
provincial health administration ordered Wednesday [1 Apr 2009] that
kindergartens must be closed for more than 2 weeks if 2 or more
pupils were diagnosed to be infected with HFMD.

Chinese state media reported last year [2008] that the virus infected
27 000 persons and killed dozens nationwide -- with central Anhui
province being the worst hit, with 26 deaths -- in the 1st few months
of last year [2008] before reports of outbreaks subsided in May [2008].

HFMD is a common childhood illness that mainly affects children under
the age of 10. Symptoms include fever, sores in the mouth, and a rash
with blisters. It can sometimes be fatal if complications occur. It
is not related to hoof-and-mouth disease, which infects cattle,
sheep, and pigs. The disease, which is more common in summer and
autumn is not included in the routine reporting list of infectious
diseases in China.
