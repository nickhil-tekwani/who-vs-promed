The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 5 Oct 2018:
- A total of 172 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, including 140 confirmed and 32 probable.
- Of the 140 confirmed, 76 died, and 49 are cured.
- 10 suspected cases are under investigation.
- 5 new confirmed cases in Beni.
- 1 new person healed in Beni.
- 2 new confirmed cases, including 1 Beni and 1 in Butembo.

News of the response
Port of entry monitoring
------------------------
- To date, 7 438 574 travelers have been checked at the various entry points set up.

Medical care
------------
- A transient isolation unit was opened in Bunia to accommodate potential suspect and confirmed cases detected in the city.
- To date, 56 patients were treated with mAb 114, Remdesivir, ZMapp, or Regeneron. Of these 56 patients, 27 were cured and were discharged, 14 died, and 15 are still hospitalized.

Vaccination
-----------
- Since the beginning of the vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 14 619 people were vaccinated, including 4937 in Beni [North Kivu], 4269 in Mabalako [North Kivu], 1653 in Mandima [Ituri], 1337 in Katwa [North Kivu], 1060 in Butembo [North Kivu], 377 in Bunia [Ituri], 355 in Tchomia [Ituri], 270 in Masereka [North Kivu], 240 in Komanda [Ituri], and 121 in Oicha [North Kivu].

[2] Knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) in the eastern DRC Ebola outbreak

---------------------------
We rapidly mobilised research teams to survey Ebola-related KAP in purposively sampled groups living in Mangina (epicentre of the epidemic), Beni (30 km [18.6 mi] from the epicentre), Butembo (80 km [49.7 mi] from the epicentre), and the IDP [Internal Displaced Persons] camp of Komanda. We developed a 52-item questionnaire based on past KAP questionnaires used in Guinea and focused on several key constructs: Ebola-specific knowledge and misconceptions, effective response, prevention practices, health-seeking and burial intentions, and attitudes toward the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine. Between 4-22 Aug 2018, we surveyed 582 participants.

Knowledge of transmission via infected corpses was high (518 [89%] of 581 participants) in our study and in KAP surveys in west Africa. Despite this knowledge, 44 (8%) of 580 participants (compared with 3% in Guinea) would wash or touch the body if a family member died of suspected Ebola virus disease, suggesting that an important minority of Congolese people might also engage in high-risk burial practices.

The survey results revealed some worrying attitudes: unwillingness to send a family member suspected of being infected with Ebola virus to an Ebola treatment unit (ETU; 101 [17%] of 580 participants in our survey vs less than 516 [under 9%] of 5733 participants in Guinea) and intention to hide family members from health authorities (101 [17%] of 581 participants in our survey vs 221 [4%] of 5520 participants in Guinea). These attitudes suggest that social resistance to control efforts can also be expected in eastern DR Congo.

The complex humanitarian crisis in eastern DR Congo is further characterised by large numbers of IDPs, displaced from their native lands by violent conflict. Our survey included 97 residents of the IDP camp of Komanda. IDPs were distinct from other survey participants, with a lower education level than non-IPDs: 37 (38%) of 97 with no formal education versus 51 (11%) of 484 non-IDPs (p under 0.0001). Additionally, IDPs had a lower level of Ebola virus disease knowledge than non-IPDs: 1 (1%) IPDs with comprehensive knowledge versus 125 (26%) non-IDPs (p under 0.0001). These findings suggest that IDPs are susceptible to Ebola virus infection and other infectious diseases.

Vaccine acceptance was high in our survey (82% willingness to accept vaccines for family members). Participants in the focus group discussions reported that the public were clamouring for the vaccine.

In summary, these data suggest that burial practices, social resistance, and violent conflict can be barriers to Ebola virus control efforts in eastern DR Congo, but acceptance of the new vaccine is high. Our late-breaking findings, rapidly collected during an unfolding epidemic in a remote and dangerous setting, have already been communicated to local health authorities and incorporated into the public health strategy. We conclude with a sobering perspective from a community health worker in one of our focus group discussions, who compared the Ebola virus outbreak with the chronic internecine conflict in eastern DR Congo: "We think it would be good that as much effort be put into mobilising teams to end the insecurity. Ebola kills, but the rebels kill more."

[This is a valuable rapid study of KAP in the current DRC North Kivu outbreak, made even more useful because the responses can be directly compared to those obtained with a similar survey in Guinea during the 2014-2016 West African outbreak. This short article is worth reading in its entirety, including the summary figure of key KAP responses. - Mod.LXL
