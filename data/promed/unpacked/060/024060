The following chronology of nosocomial [non-tuberculous] mycobacteriosis outbreaks in the United States is abstracted from Gideon http://www.GideonOnline.com and the Gideon e-book series (1,2). Primary references are available on request.

1987 - An outbreak (17 cases) of _Mycobacterium chelonae_ otitis media was caused by contaminated water used by an ENT practice in Louisiana.

1995 to 1996 - An outbreak (87 cases) of postinjection abscesses due to _Mycobacterium abscessus_ in several states was ascribed to an adrenal cortex extract.
1998 - An outbreak (6 cases) of _Mycobacterium mucogenicum_ bacteremia among bone marrow transplant and oncology patients in Minnesota was related to contaminated water.
1999 - An outbreak (10 cases) of intra- and periarticular _M. abscessus_ infection in Texas was caused by contaminated benzalkonium chloride used for injection.
2000 to 2001 - An outbreak (110 cases) of skin infections due to _M. fortuitum_ was caused by contaminated footbaths in California nail salons.
2001 - An outbreak of _M. chelonae_ keratitis in California was associated with laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK).
2001 to 2002 - An outbreak of _Mycobacterium simiae_ in a Texas hospital was related to contaminated tap water.
2002 - An outbreak (14 confirmed and 11 suspected cases) of soft tissue infections due to _M. abscessus_ followed injections of cosmetic substances administered by unlicensed practitioners in New York City.
2002 - An outbreak (115 cases or more) of cutaneous infection by _M. fortuitum_ was associated with a contaminated footbath in a nail salon in California.
2002 (publication year) - An outbreak (34 cases) of _M. chelonae_ soft tissue infection in California was associated with liposuction.
2002 to 2003 - An outbreak (4 cases) of _M. chelonae_ infection among patients undergoing rhytidectomies [facelift cosmetic surgery] in New Jersey was caused by a contaminated methylene blue solution.
2003 - An outbreak (3 cases) of _Mycobacterium goodii_ infection was associated with surgical implants in a Colorado hospital.
2004 - An outbreak (12 cases) among Americans of soft tissue infections caused by _M. abscessus_ following cosmetic surgery performed at various clinics in the Dominican Republic.
2004 - An outbreak (143 cases) of mycobacterial skin and soft tissue infection (presumed _M. fortuitum_) was reported among persons attending nail salons in California.
2008 - An outbreak (4 cases) of _M. mucogenicum_ bloodstream infections was reported among patients with sickle cell disease, in North Carolina.
2009 (publication year) - An outbreak (6 cases) of _M. chelonae_ infection was associated with a tattoo establishment.
2009 - An outbreak (2 cases, 1 confirmed) of _Mycobacterium haemophilum_ skin infection was associated with a tattoo parlor in Washington State.
2011 (publication year) - An outbreak (3 cases) of _Mycobacterium bolletii_/_M. massiliense_ furunculosis was associated with a nail salon in North Carolina.
2011 (publication year) - An outbreak of _M. abscessus_ infection was associated with outpatient rhytidectomies [face lifts].
2011 - An outbreak (2 cases) of _M. haemophilum_ infection was reported among people receiving tattoos in the Seattle, Washington region. [ProMED-mail post Mycobacterium haemophilum - USA: (WA) tattoo 20110812.2444]
2011 (publication year) - An outbreak (11 cases) of _Mycobacterium porcinum_ infection in a Texas hospital was related to contamination of drinking water.

2011 to 2012 - An outbreak (15 cases) of infection by rapidly-growing mycobacteria was reported among pediatric hematopoietic cell transplant in a Minnesota hospital.
2013 - An outbreak (2 cases) of non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection was associated with fractionated CO2 laser resurfacing procedures performed at a clinic in North Carolina.
2013 to 2014 - An outbreak (19 cases) wound infection was reported among Americans who had traveled to the Dominican Republic for cosmetic surgery - including 12 due to _M. abscessus_ and 2 _M. fortuitum_.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Berger for his continuing contributions.

Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are acid-fast bacilli that are part of a grouping separate from the _M. tuberculosis_ complex (http://www.cdc.gov/hai/organisms/mycobacterium.html). Non-pigmented, rapidly growing NTM species (RGM) include the _M. fortuitum_ complex and the _M. chelonae-abscessus_ group. _M. immunogenum_ is a member of the _M. chelonae-abscessus_ group. A subset _M. abscessus_ group has been recognized and includes _M. abscessus_ sensu stricto, _M. massiliense_ and _M. bolletii_. Pigmented, intermediately growing NTM include _M. marinum_ and _M. gordonae_. Slowly growing NTM include _M. kansasii_ and the _M. avium/intracellulare_ complex. Other slow growers include _M. ulcerans_, _M. haemophilum_, and _M. simiae_. - Mod.ML
