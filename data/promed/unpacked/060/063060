First Case Of WNV In Dogs Found In Georgia
-------------------------------------------
The focus to date on West Nile Virus has been on birds, horses and
humans, but now dogs are added to the list. A local veterinarian, Dr.
David Bryan of Bryan and Hight Veterinary Clinic, received results
this week that a blood sample of a dog he treated earlier in the month
had come back positive for the mosquito-borne West Nile Virus. The
virus is spread by migrating birds, which are in turn bitten by
mosquitoes, and those in turn transmit the virus to horses, humans,
and [other animals such as] dogs.
Several cases of WNV in horses have been diagnosed in the North
Florida/South Georgia area since the virus ´headed south´ earlier this
year, and a dead osprey collected in the Lake Douglas area tested
positive. But this is the first case of WNV in a dog.
Dr. Bryan said he had just attended a seminar on WNV in Tifton where
the Serology Department at the UGA diagnostic lab in Tifton presented
a list of 8 clinical signs of WNV in horses. The dog he treated showed
6 of the 8. Dr. Bryan said the dog was an otherwise-healthy two and
one-half-year-old male Labrador whose owners live just across Lake
Seminole near Sneads, Fla. When he was brought in, the dog was
drooling, appeared to feel bad, had facial tics in the muzzle-area
muscles, and his left ear was drawn up toward the top of his head. His
vision appeared to be impaired, his appetite was poor and his
temperature was up. All in all, Bryan said, he showed signs of a
central nervous system problem.
In-house lab work was reasonably unremarkable, so blood samples were
sent to Tifton for screening, including Eastern and Western equine
encephalitis and West Nile virus. The encephalitis screenings were
negative, but the WNV was positive. Dr. Bryan said veterinarians had
thought that dogs would not be affected by WNV.
Bryan had begun treating the dog with chloramphenicol, an old
broad-spectrum antibiotic which the doctor says he has used for years.
He explained that this medicine will cross the blood-brain barrier and
might have some anti-viral properties as well. The human version,
chloromycetin, had been off the market for some time. The great news
is that the dog was well enough to go home in 3 or 4 days and reached
full recovery about 5 days after that.
Dr. Bryan said while there are WNV vaccines for horses, there are none
yet for dogs, and he has contacted a pharmaceutical company which
produces horse vaccine to see if a dog vaccine is forthcoming.

[Pet owners should not panic. As ProMED posted in 1999:
>Pets: No [clinical] cases of encephalitis linked to WNV have been
documented in pets in this [1999] outbreak, nor does it appear from
other WNV outbreaks overseas that this will be likely. However, CDC
has found 3 positive sera from healthy dogs in a preliminary screen of
84 dog serum samples from New York City. Pets will probably be similar
to most species of mammals and birds in that they are susceptible to a
transient WNV infection if bitten by an infected mosquito, but are
unlikely to become clinically ill. Ref: West Nile-like virus - USA
(New York): UPDATE 19991023.1908. There were no reports of clinically
WNV-positive dogs in 2000. - Mod.JW]

West Nile Virus Found in Camden County Crows
The State Public Health Laboratory today reported that 2 crows found
in Camden County are positive for West Nile virus. This represents the
second finding of West Nile virus in the state this year.
The first evidence of West Nile virus was a blue jay found in Cabarrus
County, announced earlier this month.
When the Cabarrus County blue jay was confirmed to have West Nile
virus
on 17 Sep 2001, acting State Health Director Leah Devlin issued a
Public Health Warning advising residents to be diligent in protecting
themselves against mosquito bites. This warning remains in effect.
In addition to protecting themselves from mosquito bites, North
Carolina residents can help reduce the health risk from West Nile
virus by reporting dead or dying birds to Public Health Pest
Management officials. The 3 kinds of birds that are of particular
concern are crows, blue jays, and hawks, but residents should report
any bird behaving strangely.
Call 1-877-790-1747 or e-mail NCWNV@NCmail.net to report birds. More
information on reporting birds and an online form for reporting dead
birds is also available at
www.deh.enr.state.nc.us/phpm/deadbirdform/index.html.
West Nile Virus was first detected in North Carolina last year [2000]
in a dead crow found at Jordan Lake State Park in Chatham. It is
important to remember that the virus is transmitted to humans when a
mosquito bites an infected bird and then bites a human. It is not
known to pass directly from birds to humans or from human to human.

Second West Nile Virus-positive Horse Confirmed In Virginia
-----------------------------------------------------------
The USDA National Veterinary Services laboratory in Ames, Iowa has
confirmed that a sample from a horse submitted for testing by the
Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) is
positive for West Nile virus (WNV). This is the second occurrence of
West Nile virus in a horse in Virginia. The first was reported earlier
in September 2001.
The horse was from Madison County near Brightwood, Virginia. Clinical
symptoms included ataxia (wobbly gait), a head tilt, and [once down
an inability to get back up. The horse was euthanized. Roughly 40% of
the horses with West Nile virus die or are euthanized. Those that
outlive the 2- to 3-week illness generally recover with no long-term
effects.
Transmission between horses [or from horses to humans is extremely
unlikely [because horses don´t have enough virus in their blood to
infect mosquitoes - Mod.JW. Currently, no drugs exist to treat
infected horses or humans. A vaccine for horses recently received
conditional approval, but the supply is still limited.
