Two bald eagles have died recently on Lake Ouachita, one from
the mysterious disease that has killed 60 eagles in Arkansas since
1994, officials said Wednesday.
Both adult males were found near the shore -- one 7 Dec 1999
near Buckville on the north side and the other 29 Dec 1999 near
Crystal Springs on the south. They were found "pretty much straight
across" from each other on the 48 300-acre lake, Joe Mosby, a
spokesman for the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, said.
Dr. Kimberli Miller of the National Wildlife Health Center at
Madison, Wis., said the eagle found 7 Dec 1999 died of avian
vacuolar myelinopathy (AVM). The disease was formerly known as
coot and eagle brain lesion syndrome, which caused the earlier
eagle deaths in Arkansas.
The second carcass is being tested. While the bird had no visible
wounds, Mosby said, "It'll be a few days before we get the lab
results from Wisconsin. Thus far the only known eagle deaths this
winter have occurred at Lake Ouachita, but they have found some
coots at DeGray Lake with AVM."
Coots are a small duck-like member of the rail family and a favorite
food of wintering bald eagles in Arkansas. The birds generally
migrate to Arkansas from Canada and the upper Midwest during
the fall and return north in the spring.
The first eagle to die in Arkansas of the mysterious disease, which
affects the bird's brain and neurological system, was found
Thanksgiving Day of 1994 at DeGray Lake about 25 miles from
Lake Ouachita. Dozens more died that winter on DeGray Lake in
what became the largest bald eagle die-off in U.S. history.
One eagle was found dead at Lake Ouachita in the winter of 1995-
96, but avian vacuolar myelinopathy could not be confirmed as the
cause. In a second outbreak during the winter of 1996-97, eagles
were found dead at DeGray, Ouachita and nearby Lake Hamilton.
A few died in 1997-98.
Intensive investigations and research began after the 1994-95
deaths, but scientists have failed to determine how the birds
contract the disease. Mosby said a number of eagles and coots
and one mallard have been found dead from the disease in
Georgia, North & South Carolina.
Scientists again are gathering information and observing bird
activity at DeGray Lake, where hundreds of coots and several
eagles have been trapped, banded and released during the past
two winters.

[The disease affects the brain and spinal cord by damaging the
myelin sheath insulating the nerve fibers. It is diagnosed by
microscopic examination of very fresh brain and spinal cord tissue.
Dr. Nancy Thomas, the USGS (United State Geological Survey)
pathologist, first described the lesion. In affected birds the disease
appears as open spaces in the white matter of the brain.
When the coating surrounding the myelin is damaged,
communication in the nervous system is impaired, causing a bird to
become uncoordinated or paralyzed. Lesions have been
confirmed in a North Carolina mallard and ring-necked duck, and a
Strom Thurmond Lake bald eagle.
Afflicted birds typically fly erratically or are unable to fly; they may
crash land, swim tipped to one side with one or both legs or wings
extended, or be in the water on their backs with their feet in the air.
On land birds appear intoxicated -- they stagger and have difficulty
walking and may fall over and be unable to right themselves.
Affected birds, however, are usually alert and may still bite when
handled.

AVM, formerly known as Coot and Eagle Brain Lesion Syndrome
(CEBLS), is an avian disease believed to be caused by a
neurotoxin of unknown origin. It causes lesions (open spaces) in
the white matter of the brain and in the spinal cord of affected birds.
Dead AVM birds appear to be in good body condition and have no
visible external or internal changes with the exception of
microscopic neural lesions. Microscopy is used to confirm the
disease in new species and at new locations. A naturally occurring
or man-made toxin is the most probable cause of the lesions.
Tests for a wide range of known toxins such as pesticides and
heavy metals have resulted in no significant findings.
Chemicals known to create a similar lesion include triethyl tin,
bromethylene and extracts from toxic plants that grow in Africa and
Australia, but tests for these compounds have been negative.
There has also been no evidence of infectious disease caused by
viruses, bacteria or prions (mad cow-type disease).
Despite extensive testing the cause of the disease and the route of
exposure is still unknown. USGS pathologists have tested the
tissues of dead birds for bacteria, viruses, and parasites and none
have been found. In humans and other mammals, similar lesions
have been associated with genetic disorders, certain types of
chemicals or toxic plants. Tests for these chemicals in the affected
birds have been negative or inconclusive. - Mod.TG
