Concerning the rabies outbreak afflicting the endangered Ethiopian
wolves at Bale Mountains National Park, it is an excellent idea for
the World Wildlife Fund to expand the Ethiopian Wolf Conservation
Program (EWCP) vaccination campaign, as Alex Kirby of the BBC
reported is being done.
However, Kirby apparently took his information entirely from the
EWCP, whose claims about the origins, duration, and spread of the
current rabies outbreak in Bale Mountains National Park are
contradicted by the Homeless Animals Protection Society (HAPS) of
Ethiopia.
Animal People extensively explored the competing claims in the
article "Conservation group experts urged dog shooting in Ethiopia"
(November 2003 issue, page 1).
Though the EWCP has claimed that there are no indigenous homeless
dogs at Bale Mountains National Park, only wanderers from elsewhere,
since they vaccinated and sterilized 80 percent of the local dogs, a
different situation is reflected in the essay "The dogs of Bale,"
published in our May 2001 edition. HAPS cofounder Efrem Legesse has
produced documented evidence that there was in fact a substantial
local homeless dog population in and around the villages just outside
Bale Mountains National Park.
Supporting materials sent by Legesse included [documented evidence]
showing where the homeless dog packs lived. He urged then that the
vaccination and sterilization work begun by the EWCP should be
extended to the homeless dog population, to prevent just the sort of
outbreak that has occurred.
The current rabies outbreak actually started in mid-August 2003.
[Though] Hana Kifle, another HAPS cofounder, documented and recorded
an Ethiopian wolf with an apparent bite wound to the back of the
head, which wandering in a dazed way about 25 km from the nearest
known wolf habitat, the report [reproduced by Animal People] was
dismissed.
Efrem Legesse and another HAPS member have documented evidence that
shooting homeless dogs by officials caused them to flee into the
interior of Bale Mountains National Park, toward the endangered
wolves. There could be no stronger conservation argument for
vaccinating and sterilizing the homeless dogs, as HAPS has been
urging, and for halting the shooting, which has only increased the
risk of the dogs encountering the wolves.
[The current vaccination and sterilisation campaigns are
insufficient]. EWCP annual report for 2000-01 documents 390
sterilizations, estimating 47 percent coverage of the owned dog
population. No figure appears to be given for number of vaccinations.
The annual 2002-03 report documents 372 sterilizations plus 1475
vaccinations. After going to press, we learned that the sterilization
and vaccination projects for local working and pet dogs were
discontinued in June.
[It has been reported that] a local man died from rabies because
there was no post-exposure vaccine to be had anywhere near Bale
Mountains National Park, and there were no vehicles available to
transport the man to Addis Ababa.

[The clear disagreement between HAPS and EWCP reflects a well-known
and difficult dilemma in rabies areas, where public-health and
veterinary authorities -- responsible for the protection of humans,
pets, and livestock from exposure to rabies -- have to deal with the
homeless or stray dog population while trying to protect endangered
wildlife. Obviously, expanding the oral vaccination program to cover
adjacent regions should be encouraged. - Mod.AS]
