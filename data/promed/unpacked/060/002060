Pakistan: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever death in Rawalpindi
-----------------------------------------------
Confirming a recent death from Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus
(CCHFV) infection, the Ministry of Health on Saturday [25 Sep 2004] issued
precautionary instructions to the Punjab Health Department on how to deal
with a possible outbreak. A patient died of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever
early this week [final week of September 2004] in Rawalpindi General
Hospital. The doctor who 1st attended to the patient also developed
symptoms of the virus. The doctor was placed in isolation to avoid further
[transmission of infection].
"The National Institute of Health (NIH) has produced national guidelines on
"Case Definitions, Management and Prevention of Infectious Diseases", said
an official press statement from the Health Ministry. The guidelines
recommend proper interventions by provincial health departments, hospitals,
and executive district officers for health who are responsible for
purchasing medicines and taking other precautionary measures. The statement
said that, under the NIH guidelines on CCHFV, a task force, consisting of
health personnel and officials from the agriculture and livestock
department, was formed to prevent further outbreaks.
The affected area has been surveyed, and the agriculture and livestock
department has developed a plan to spray cattle sheds to kill infected
ticks. The statement said a campaign has been started to raise public
awareness about Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. It added that blood
samples of the relatives of the deceased, and of those who handled the
patient, had been sent to the NIH for investigation.
Ribazole [generic name - Ribavirin], a drug used to treat suspected cases
of CCHFV, is available on the market. The NIH has strongly recommended its
use for suspected cases of the virus. The provinces were asked to ensure
that a sufficient stock of Ribazole is available at district headquarters
hospitals.

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is transmitted to humans by ticks and can
be acquired also by direct contact with blood and secretions of infected
patients. Nosocomial transmission of infection in hospitals in Rawalpindi
has been recorded previously. In 2002, a female doctor contracted CCHFV
infection from a patient and died. 2 doctors involved in her treatment also
contracted infection; both survived. Previously, in 1974, a physician died
in Rawalpindi General Hospital as a result of CCHFV infection contracted
from patients. - Mod.CP]
