Our lab is currently sequencing the mitochondrial genomes of several
kinetoplasids. We have primers for several genes. You are welcome to the
primer sequences.
Ramos et al., 1996 has a hybridization to PCR amplified mini exon assay for
leishmainas. In Experimental Parasitology, 83(3) 242-50.

We are currently using PCR for Leishmania braziliensis complex and it works
well. The samples are tissue biopsies and now we are tyring aspirate from
the ulcerating lesions. Also, we would like to recover DNA from smears and
try PCR. The primers we are using are those described by Lopez, M. et al.
(Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 49(3), 1993. pp. 348-356.).
