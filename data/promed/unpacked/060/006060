Japan finds fresh case of bird flu
----------------------------------
A fresh case of bird flu has been confirmed on a chicken farm
neighboring earlier outbreaks discovered in eastern Japan late last
month [June 2005], a local government official said on Monday [11 Jul
2005].
An official with Ibaraki prefecture said tests had confirmed an
outbreak of bird flu, which was likely to be the same weak strain of
the disease that was 1st found a few weeks earlier. "It's unlikely to
be the more virulent strain," the official said. He said the latest
case shares many similarities with the earlier outbreaks, which saw
no drastic rise in fowl deaths that would have indicated the presence
of a virulent disease.
The local government has ordered all 8500 chickens at the farm in the
latest case culled. The less virulent H5N2 strain of bird flu was 1st
found at a chicken farm in Ibaraki prefecture, near Tokyo, on 26 Jun
2005. It was the 1st case of the H5N2 strain discovered in Japan.
The government restricted the movement of chickens in a 5 km radius
around the farm to prevent the disease from spreading. It is located
about 1.25 km from the 1st outbreak.
The H5N2 strain is weaker than the H5N1 strain found in previous
avian flu outbreaks in Japan early last year [2004].
The H5N1 strain, which 1st surfaced in poultry in Hong Kong and China
8 years ago, has been blamed for the deaths of more than 50 people in
countries such as Viet Nam, Thailand and Cambodia.
