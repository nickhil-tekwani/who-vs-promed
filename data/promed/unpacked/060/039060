re: MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (66): Oman (SH), animal res, camel conf, OIE 20140523.2493556
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The 5 MERS-CoV positive camels reported on 23 May 2014 by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, Oman, are the same animals from which we investigated in detail MERS-CoV phylogenetics and viral load, and which was published on 24 Apr 2014 in Eurosurveillance: Nowotny and Kolodziejek, Eurosurveillance 2014 Apr 24; 19(16). pii: 20781 (full text link: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20781) and posted by a moderator on 26 Apr 2014 on ProMED-mail [MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (41): Oman, animal reservoir, camel 20140426.2432011].

I am very glad to see that finally the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries of Oman reported the epidemiological data of these camels. I congratulate the Ministry to this change of policy.

I wish to add that the total number of investigated camels was 76 -- that is, 6.6 per cent proved MERS-CoV nucleic acid positive.

In a previous study -- actually the 1st study which demonstrated MERS-CoV specific neutralizing antibodies in dromedary camels -- 50 out of 50 (100 per cent) camels from Oman exhibited antibodies against MERS-CoV: Reusken et al., Lancet Infect Dis. 2013 Oct;13(10):859-66 (full text link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309913701646).

Other publications followed and showed similarly high MERS-CoV antibody prevalences in camels all over the Arabian Peninsula and also in Africa.

Consequently, MERS-CoV infection in dromedary camels seems to be widespread in the Arabian Peninsula and beyond, and thus acute infections, particularly of young camels, with or without symptoms, but with virus shedding mainly through the respiratory route for some days, is probably not uncommon. In order to get better insight into MERS-CoV epidemiology in camels, a considerably higher number of camels must be investigated.

In a recent reply letter of the author to Eurosurveillance we summarized some aspects of our current knowledge on MERS-CoV infection in camels: Nowotny and Kolodziejek, Eurosurveillance 2014;19(20):pii=20811 (full text link: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20811).
