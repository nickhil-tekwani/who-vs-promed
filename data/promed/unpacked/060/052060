The Florida Department of Health [FDOH] confirmed a positive human case of West Nile virus in Martin County on Monday [30 Nov 2020] -- the 1st in 2 decades, FDOH data shows.

It is unknown when the last time a Martin County resident would have tested positive for the illness, as readily available information only dated back to 2000. St Lucie and Indian River counties also haven't seen a human case since at least 2003.

"It's unusual in that aspect," Martin County health department spokesperson Renay Rouse said of the positive human case. "However, it does happen, and pretty strange things have happened in 2020."

It is most commonly spread to people by the bite of an infected mosquito, according to the Centers for Disease Control. There are no vaccines to prevent it [in humans but there is a vaccine for horses. - Mod.TY] or medications to treat it in people. Most people infected do not feel sick and it is rarely fatal.

Martin County issued a mosquito-borne illness advisory on 19 Aug [2020], after sentinel chickens tested positive, which remains in effect as increased disease activity persists, according to a news release issued Monday [30 Nov 2020].

All 3 counties [Martin, Indian River, and St Lucie counties] found the virus among their respective sentinel chicken programs this year [2020], which are used to detect the presence of West Nile and other mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever or Zika virus.

A positive test result from the chickens means the risk of transmission to humans has increased.

Human cases of West Nile aren't a rarity in Florida, though. As of 19 Oct 2020, there had been 59 statewide in Bay, Broward, Palm Beach, and Miami-Dade counties.

Infections typically rise in the hot, damp summer months, but transmission can occur any month of the year. It isn't uncommon to see mosquito-borne illness advisories extend into November, Rouse said.

West Nile can cause fever, head, and body aches, vomiting, diarrhea, and rash in among one out of 5 people infected; but a majority of those who contract the virus show no symptoms.

Residents should take preventative measures including:
- cover skin with clothing or repellent;
- drain standing water to stop mosquitoes from multiplying;
- cover doors and windows with screens to keep mosquitoes out of your house

[This report is a good example of why the absence of cases caused by a pathogen such as West Nile virus for a long period of time does not mean that pathogen is gone permanently. Fortunately, the Martin County Health Department had sentinel chicken surveillance in place that detected the presence of the virus and issued a timely warning to the public. West Nile virus is present in all 48 continuous USA states so occurrence of human or equine cases should not be surprising. Incidence of WNV infection can vary from year to year and from place to place. Human and animal health authorities need to be prepared to detect and respond when cases occur. - Mod.TY
