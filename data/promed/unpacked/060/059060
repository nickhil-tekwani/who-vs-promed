Data from Mick Erickson of Chase Lake

Pelican shells were normal. The chicks did hatch but died without the
adults to care for them. Some eggs were unfertilized. The station is 20
miles from Chase Lake, and only visited 6 times per year, but a non-staff
researcher is camped there.
4 birds were radio-tagged, and 2 went to Waubay in SD. One bird went to
Northwest ND and one to near the North Dakota/South Dakota state line.
Birds seen in other states-basic reports look good.
More testing is being done at the US Geological Survey Station in Madison WI.
