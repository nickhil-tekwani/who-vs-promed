From: Dennis M. Perrotta <Dennis.Perrotta@tdh.state.tx.us>

The recent post [see ref. above may have caused some confusion among
readers. We received several calls asking if this was another alert about
current exposures. It appears that it was a journal article.
The original alert occurred in 1995-96 and can be found in the two MMWR
articles:
<http://www.cdc.gov/epo.mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00043182.htm>
and
<http://www.cdc.gov/epo/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtm/00041544.htm>
The company that manufactures Crema de Balleza - Manning has reportedly
reformulated the cream without calomel (mercurous chloride). Last year, a
Texas Dept of Health staff obtained a bottle of the new formulation and
sent it to a reference lab for analysis. There was no mercury found.
This new reformulation has the exact same appearance as the former one and
so it is difficult to determine, at a quick glance, if an individual is
using the old or new formulation.
I leave it to you as editors to determine if you think this clarification
is needed, and if so, please post it. We have received a number of
inquiries from individuals who took the posting as a current alert.

[We thank Dennis & those others who e-mailed us to say this report is of an
outbreak that took place in 1995-96. Unfortunately, this was not mentioned
in the news report that came to our notice. We regret the waste of time
of CDC & the people who called there. - Mod.JW
