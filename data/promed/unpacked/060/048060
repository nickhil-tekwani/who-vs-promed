Rice blast decimates paddy fields
----------------------------------
Chhumchaur Jiulo used to hold the distinction of being the highest
place in the world where paddy was cultivated. Not anymore. Farmers
of this place in Jumla district [Mid Western region] stopped growing
paddy after their paddy fell prey to rice blast, a fungal disease.
Until 2006, rice was the main crop in Chhumchaur Jiulo, 850 metres
[2789 ft] above sea level. But, say farmers, the officials did not
take initiative to stamp out the disease.

A farmer said, "All of 440 families here used to cultivate paddy. But
over the last 2 years, the blast has completely decimated our crops."
Even before the disease hit, the money the villagers made from rice
harvests was barely enough to cover their living expenses for 6
months. "Agriculture experts had visited our fields. But they neither
returned, nor prescribed any pesticide," said another farmer.

Deputy Director of the District Agriculture Development Office
(DADO), Dor Bahadur Rayamajhi said his office didn't brush off the
farmers. He said there are only 5 technical assistants who have to
oversee some 30 communities in the district, and perhaps because of
Chhumchaur Jiulo's remoteness they did not visit the area. More
importantly, he said, none of the farmers sought counsel from DADO.

[Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Magnaporthe grisea_ (synonyms
_Pyricularia grisea_, _P. oryzae_) with potential yield losses of
more than 50 percent. The fungus can affect leaves, neck, collar, and
nodes. Spread occurs with infected plant material, by mechanical
means, water, and wind. Disease management may include fungicides and
cultural practices, but relies mainly on resistant varieties.
However, the fungus is highly variable and this favours the emergence
of new strains with increased virulence. For more information on rice
blast see links and previous posts below.

Jumla district is part of the Karnali Zone in the northwestern
mountainous region, one of the most remote and poor regions in Nepal.
The report above illustrates the difficulties in providing extension
support to these farmers, which would be vital for improving their
level of food security.
