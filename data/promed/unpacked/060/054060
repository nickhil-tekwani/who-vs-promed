E. COLI, OPEN FARM - UK (ENGLAND) (02)

I pregnancy test 1500-2000 cows weekly over the summer in Australia. I have
never developed any condition attributable to E.coli and yet become grossly
contaminated with faecal matter. Why is this so? 40 years ago we did it
without gloves!
[Great question! Any answers are welcome. If it were Salmonella, some of
Tom Humphrey's work at Exeter might suggest the bug was just bigger and
badder. Also, if your doing 1500-2000 cows weekly then I suspect you are
neither old or immature and are probably fit as a fiddle. These are two
possible reasons but I sure there are many more. Unfortunately, with farm
outbreaks like this, we often don't often find out exactly why they occur
when they do. - Mod. pc]
