Pests, diseases strike up to half of NW China wheat crop
--------------------------------------------------------
Pests and diseases have infected 30 to 50 per cent of the wheat crop, or
187 000 hectares [462 000 acres], in north west China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region, the regional agriculture department revealed. The
acreage affected by pests, mainly aphids, and diseases like powdery mildew
accounted for 87.5 per cent of the wheat cultivation area, said Lai Weili,
director of Crop Farming Bureau of the regional Agriculture Department.

If not effectively controlled, the summer [2009] harvest would be harmed,
said Lai. Lai said aphids had been found on 30 per cent of plants, and
powdery mildew disease, one of the most dangerous wheat diseases, had
already affected more than 92 000 hectares [227 400 acres], where the
average diseased plant rate has reached 46.5 per cent. "This year's [2009]
pest and disease outbreak is the most serious in recent years," said Lai.

According to the China Meteorological Administration, the average
temperatures in Ningxia in March and April [2009] were 5 to 6 degrees
higher than average for the time of year. "The southern part of Ningxia was
forecast to have some rain in June. However, the hot and humid weather
close to the harvest season has helped the spread of stripe rust disease,
as well as powdery mildew," said Lai.

The regional government on Monday [25 May 2009] issued an emergency order
to local authorities to monitor the problem closely and inform farmers of
the development of the control measures. The government has also stepped up
checks to ensure fake agrochemicals are not used.

[2] Multiple fungi, wheat and barley - Ireland

Crop diseases on the rise as heavy rain takes it toll
-----------------------------------------------------
Bad weather is causing havoc with crucial spraying operations on cereals,
Teagasc [Irish Agriculture and Food Development Authority] has warned. The
broken weather will have serious implications for yield, with the authority
already predicting these to be "modest" at best.

Its latest crop report says that wet weather diseases are predominating.
"Spring cereals are suffering quite badly," said tillage expert Jim
O'Mahony. "Disease levels have increased with rhyncho [scald], net blotch,
and mildew evident in most [barley] crops," Mr O'Mahony warned. He says a
priority must also be given to septoria control in winter wheat, which has
showed a marked increase.

"Give priority to spraying the flag leaf fungicide on winter wheat because
this is where most of the problems will occur," he said. Mildew rates have
not increased in winter wheat in the past 2 weeks and remain at a low
level. Rhyncho is the dominant disease in winter barley but it is being
held off by sprays. Again, mildew levels have not increased.

[Powdery mildew of wheat is caused by _Blumeria graminis_ f. sp. _tritici_
and affects all aerial parts of the host. Stripe rust (or yellow rust) of
cereal crops is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ var.
_striiformis_ and can result in total yield loss. Cereal diseases of the
septoria complex are caused by the fungi _Mycosphaerella graminicola_
(previously _Septoria tritici_) and _Phaeosphaeria nodorum_; these
pathogens cause blotches on both leaves and glumes.

Net blotch of barley is caused by the fungus _Pyrenophora teres_ and
affects only domestic and wild barleys (_Hordeum_ spp.). Scald caused by
_Rhynchosporium secalis_ is one of the most destructive diseases of barley.
Powdery mildew of barley is caused by _Blumeria graminis_ f. sp. _hordei_,
and the less important downy mildew is caused by _Sclerophthora_ species.

Management strategies for these pathogens generally include cultural
practices to reduce inoculum, fungicides, use of clean seed, and resistant
cultivars. For more information see links below.

In China, outbreaks of stripe rust on wheat have been reported earlier this
year (2009) as well as in 2008, and emerging new strains are suspected. The
additional powdery mildew problems in the north reported in item 1 above
could be compounded by the presence of large numbers of aphids, which may
assist in spreading the spores. Most of the diseases mentioned in item 2
above have also been reported to be active in the UK and Germany at present
(see previous ProMED-mail posts listed below).
