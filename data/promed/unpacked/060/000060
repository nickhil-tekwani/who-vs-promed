Anthrax has killed 6 people and affected 32 in a tribal-dominated
Orissa district in the past fortnight, say officials. All the deaths
took place in Koraput district. The victims contracted the disease
after eating rotten buffalo meat, officials said.
Two people from the Paraja and Sirimunda village, some 500 km from
here, died of the disease on 20-21 May 2007, while 4 more succumbed
later, chief district medical officer K. Haribandhu Reddy said. He
said other people infected with the disease were now out of danger,
as a team of doctors was camping in these 2 villages.
Anthrax usually affects cattle but passes on to humans if they eat
contaminated meat. The disease, if not diagnosed early, can be fatal.

[An earlier report issued on 1 Jun 2007 had 2 dying from eating
"cattle meat." It is not unlikely, in the confusion of the situation,
that the species of the index animal case has been obscured by later
livestock deaths. See:
<http://newspostindia.com/report-1928>.
One must presume that the team of doctors was doing more than just
camping near the affected villages. - Mod.MHJ]

Six persons have reportedly died, and 50 have been affected by
anthrax in the past one week [sic.: See above for 1st deaths on 20-21
May 2007. This problem is now well into its 2nd week, if not 3rd. -
Mod.MHJ] in Semiliguda and Laxmipur blocks of Koraput district.
According to reports, a week back, 2 tribals died, and 10 were
affected in Subai village in Semiliguda block. On Wednesday [30 May
2007], 4 persons died, and 20 were affected in Parja village under
the same block. The condition of 10 persons is stated to be critical.
Similarly, 30 persons have been affected in the neighboring villages
of Jhalaguda, Raudipadar and Daliamb under Laxmipur block. Sources
said those affected took ill after consuming raw meat.
Every year, at least 10 persons die of anthrax in these 2 blocks due
to consumption of raw meat.
Koraput Chief District Medical Officer H K Reddy reported that
medical teams are camping in the villages and measures are being
taken to prevent further spread of the disease.

Communicated by:
ProMED-mail Rapporteur Joseph P. Dudley
[Notably absent from both these reports is any comment on the
presence of a veterinary team to vaccinate local livestock and
oversee the proper disposal of any (remaining) carcasses. If, as this
report describes, some 10 human deaths from anthrax occur in these 2
blocks each year, it would be logical and cost effective to implement
a proactive annual livestock vaccination program as well as active
surveillance for unexpected animal deaths in these and the adjoining
blocks. This should be demanded by the Koraput Public Health office.
As I have said before and will keep repeating, if there are any human
cases of anthrax, with or without deaths, it is because of faults by
the responsible veterinary service and nobody else. The medics can
only do their best to tidy up the human problem. Anthrax is primarily
a livestock disease, and human cases will not occur if the disease is
properly controlled in animals. In a September 2003 ProMED report
(20030914.2328) of anthrax in Orissa, it was stated that "The
district health department has reported more than 80 cases of anthrax
since January 2003." Action would appear to be long overdue in this
region. - Mod.MHJ]
