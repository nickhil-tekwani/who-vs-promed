The Institute of Tropical Medicine confirmed 76 suspected cases of brucellosis in recent days while the fully confirmed cases remain at 21. They are mostly students and teachers of Veterinary UNA.

Miguel Cardozo, of the Institute of Tropical Medicine, explained that in the last days there were 76 cases that are under suspicion of brucellosis, after the clinical consultations of people who manifested some symptoms. Of the total, 4 people are in treatment for high suspicion of being carriers of the disease [see below - Mod.LL]. Cardozo indicated that brucellosis is a slow-growing bacterial disease that can appear 2 to 3 months after having been in contact with infected animals, so he urged people who were exposed to clinical examinations.

Those affected are mostly students and professors of the Faculty of Veterinary Sciences of the National University of Asuncion (UNA). Several months ago, an outbreak of brucellosis was detected in the institution where students, teachers and officials of the house of studies were exposed. The fact cost him the international academic accreditation he had. Finally, the case that occurred due to apparent negligence ended with the resignation of the dean of the Faculty of Veterinary Sciences of UNA. Cabrera was also charged for the crime of marketing harmful food, since it is presumed that the institution sold the milk of the infected animals.

[The organism involved has been previously reported to be _B. melitensis_. Symptoms and signs of brucellosis may develop from days to months after the initial exposure to the organism. While some individuals may develop mild symptoms, others may go on to develop long-term chronic symptoms. It is not clear if the 4 individuals noted as "carriers" have been diagnosed as chronic brucellosis and if so what organs are involved. Additionally, a previous ProMED report noted a fatality which is not mentioned in this posting.

The signs and symptoms of brucellosis are extensive and they can be similar to many other febrile illnesses, so recognition of potential exposure -- from ingestion of unpasteurized milk or cheese, employment as a veterinarian or veterinary student, in a slaughter house or meat processing plant, or working in a microbiology lab -- is vital.

The following is a recent review of caprine brucellosis:

Abstract
--------
"Caprine brucellosis is a chronic infectious disease caused by the gram-negative cocci-bacillus _Brucella melitensis_. Middle- to late-term abortion, stillbirths, and the delivery of weak offspring are the characteristic clinical signs of the disease that is associated with an extensive negative impact in a flock's productivity. _B. melitensis_ is also the most virulent _Brucella_ species for humans, responsible for a severely debilitating and disabling illness that results in high morbidity with intermittent fever, chills, sweats, weakness, myalgia, abortion, osteoarticular complications, endocarditis, depression, anorexia, and low mortality. Historical observations indicate that goats have been the hosts of _B. melitensis_ for centuries; but around 1905, the Greek physician Themistokles Zammit was able to build the epidemiological link between "Malta fever" and the consumption of goat milk. While the disease has been successfully managed in most industrialized countries, it remains a significant burden on goat and human health in the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, Central and Southeast Asia (including India and China), sub-Saharan Africa, and certain areas in Latin America, where approximately 3.5 billion people live at risk. In this review, we describe a historical evolution of the disease, highlight the current worldwide distribution, and estimate (by simple formula) the approximate costs of brucellosis outbreaks to meat- and milk-producing farms and the economic losses associated with the disease in humans. Successful control leading to eradication of caprine brucellosis in the developing world will require a coordinated Global One Health approach involving active involvement of human and animal health efforts to enhance public health and improve livestock productivity."

The City of Asuncion, Ciudad de Asuncion (https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asunci%C3%B3n), is an autonomous capital district, not a part of any department. The metropolitan area, called Gran Asuncion, includes the cities of San Lorenzo, Fernando de la Mora, Lambare, Luque, Mariano Roque Alonso, Nemby, San Antonio, Limpio, Capiata, and Villa Elisa, which are part of the Central Department. The Asuncion metropolitan area has around 2 million inhabitants. - Mod.LL]
