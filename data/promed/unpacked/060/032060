There is much speculation about the smallpox incident in 1971.

Anyone who is familiar with the disease reporting and surveillance in the
Soviet Union at that time will take any comments with a large grain of
salt. The reporting from the Central Asian Republics before the breakup of
the USSR was particularly poor. The Republics were given norms to
meet. If the norm was zero cases of smallpox, Moscow was informed annually
that there were no cases of smallpox. To not meet the norm was to be in
jeopardy of one's position. I remember visiting a children's hospital in
Baku where services to well children were provided as well as sick
children. The director of the hospital was asked how many well children
visits the past reporting year. An immediate answer of 15 000. The next
question was how many sick child visits. After some quick scurrying the
answer was 6 376. There was a norm for well child visits, but not for sick
child visits.

[Dr. Sencer raises some very important issues in this short but sweet
reminder on interpreting disease surveillance data. No cases of smallpox
reported can mean just that -- that no cases were reported, and not that
there were no cases. - Mod.MPP]

In this thread some of the discussion or arguments play on the fear that
the Soviets were successful in the endeavor to "weaponize" smallpox or make
it more virulent. Since no other Soviet fatalities are known, we have no
data about Soviet success in making smallpox more virulent. While
obtaining data from the is desirable and necessary, but whether it will be
forthcoming is questionable. The fact that all the survivors had been
vaccinated points to some form of protection afforded by vaccination, even
when it occurred, years before.

Working in New York City, I fail to understand the position to recommend
against mass vaccination. Many in our population have been waiting to be
vaccinated. If the death rate due to vaccination is on the order of 1 per
one million doses, and if we suppose the risk of even one terrorist event
involving smallpox is on the order of one in a million in the next 5 years
wouldn't that argue in favor of mass vaccination? While mandatory
vaccination may be unpopular, asking for volunteers willing to be
vaccinated would perhaps confer a herd immunity. Furthermore, if 70
percent of the population were vaccinated prior to an attack, there would
be less of a crisis and less hysteria in the event of an
outbreak. Avoiding mass hysteria would seem to be a good thing. When
these events happen close to home, the emotional aspects are heightened.

[It should be pointed out here that the estimates of serious reactions and
deaths associated with smallpox vaccine come from 20 or more years ago,
when the numbers of immunosuppressed individuals who were mainstream in
society were markedly less than in today's era. Readers are referred to
the ProMED-mail posting: Smallpox vaccine, ACIP recommendations - USA (02)
20020621.4560 for a more detailed discussion of this issue. Another issue
to be raised is who will be held responsible for the serious vaccine
reactions. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Board does not cover
smallpox vaccinations. Given that, the likelihood is that the vaccine
manufacturers and the health care providers of the vaccine will be the
subject of liability litigations. These litigations are not without
significant cost and have contributed to many vaccine manufacturers
stopping vaccine production. If this were to happen, the national
stockpile for the event of an emergency outbreak of smallpox might very
well be depleted as a result of voluntary vaccination on the part of the
general public. - Mod.MPP]
