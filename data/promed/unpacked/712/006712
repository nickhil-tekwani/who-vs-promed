4 workers have died as a result of chemical poisoning in the Tula region.
On the afternoon of 12 Dec 2005, 9 workers from the Butikovo settlement
working for the Renstroy company were admitted to hospital in the central
hospital of the Zaoksk district of the Tula region with symptoms of
poisoning. 4 of them were unconscious when taken to the hospital, where
they later died.
Physicians established that the cause of the workers' poisoning was sodium
nitrate put into food.
Sodium nitrate, a poisonous substance similar to salt with the same
saltiness as sodium chloride (common table salt), is used to prevent
liquids from freezing.

[Tula region is located in the central part of the Eastern European plain,
bordering the Lipetsk region to the south and south east, the Orel region
to the southwest, Kaluga in the West and northwest, Moscow region in the
north and north east, and the Ryazan region in the east. Its total area is
25 700 square kilometers. - ProMED-mail Russian correspondent
Sodium nitrate has on a number of occasions been mistaken for table salt.
Clinical signs of ingestion may include gastroenteritis, abdominal pains,
dizziness, bloody diarrhea, convulsions, and collapse. Purging and diuresis
is expected. If the victim receives small, repeated doses there may be
headache and mental impairment. Generally in the case of mistaking sodium
nitrate for sodium chloride, the dose may be larger for large meals typical
of celebrations. Rare cases of nitrates being converted to the more toxic
nitrites have been reported.
Sodium nitrate has been used in curing meat for centuries. Bacterial action
converts the nitrate to nitrite, which kills the organism responsible for
botulism poisoning. Generally sodium nitrite has replaced sodium nitrate,
except in slow-cured hams. - Mod.TG]
