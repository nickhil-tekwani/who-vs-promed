Dear Friends,

The reports earlier this year of dengue fever in Key West, Florida,
were alarming, but many of us saw them as consistent with dengue's
steady spread over countries and continents during the last 20 years.
The news also underscored the central role that disease surveillance
has in the effective medical response to outbreaks and pandemics.
ProMED-mail subscribers know that role very well.

Thanks to individual contributions that make up more than a quarter of
our operating budget, ProMED-mail is delivered in 5 languages to more
than 50 000 subscribers in more than 180 countries around the world. I
am writing to ask for your support once again by making a gift to our
year-end Internet-a-thon appeal. Our goal for this year-end appeal is
USD 145 000. We currently have raised USD 7285.00.

With no effective specific therapy for dengue currently available,
prevention strategies offer the best prospects of reversing its
rapidly growing infection rates. There has been significant progress
in vaccine development in recent years. Promising news, but efficient
implementation of a vaccination program requires a well-established
surveillance network. This is the discipline in which ProMED-mail has
changed the playing field.

In a joint report titled State of the world's vaccines and
immunizations, (<http://www.who.int/immunization/sowvi/en/>) the WHO
and UNICEF stressed that "surveillance and monitoring are the
cornerstones of immunization programs." ProMED-mail reports --
gathered and evaluated by respected scientists and public health
experts on the ground and unfiltered by political considerations --
provide the data that can guide decision-making and priority-setting
in immunization programs.

ProMED-mail's foundation grants are directed to specific programs, not
its basic operating costs. This year-end appeal is our most important
fund-raising effort. Its success has a direct affect on our capability
to maintain the vigilance that so many people in public health
leadership rely upon.

We realize these continue to be challenging financial times. But
ProMED provides a vitally needed service that protects us all -- and
that can only be preserved with your help. So please show your support
by donating online now or printing out our online form and mailing in
your donation.

To make a donation, go to <http://www.isid.org/netathon2010F.shtml>

In the U.S., your gift is tax deductible. In addition, as a small
token of our appreciation, each donor of USD 250 will be entered into
a drawing to win a new iPad (a gift of USD 500 gets 2 entries into the
drawing, USD 1000 gets 4 entries, etc.). Donors of USD 100 receive a
ProMED water bottle, and donations of USD 50 are eligible to receive
an environmentally friendly ProMED shopping bag.

Our goal this year is to raise USD 145 000 through the year-end
Internet-a-thon. Please go to the Internet-a-thon donation web-page
now -- and please give generously.

Sincerely,
Larry Madoff, Editor

that benefit from the service we provide. To learn more about
