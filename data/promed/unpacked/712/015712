Virginia: 1st Human Death Associated with Raccoon Rabies
--------------------------------------------------
Rabies is an acute, progressive, incurable viral encephalitis, caused by
the bite of an infected animal. In March 2003, a previously healthy man
aged 25 years from northern Virginia died from a diagnosed illness of
meningoencephalitis of unknown etiology after a 3-week illness.
Histopathologic review of central nervous system tissues at CDC revealed
viral inclusions suggestive of Negri bodies, and subsequent tests confirmed
a diagnosis of rabies. Genetic sequencing identified a rabies virus variant
associated with raccoons, but how the patient became infected remains
unknown. This report summarizes the investigation of the first documented
case of human rabies associated with a raccoon rabies virus variant in the
United States and highlights the importance of continued education in the
prevention and diagnosis of rabies.
In February 2003, the patient visited his physician with head and body
aches, nausea, abdominal pain, chills, fever of 99 to 100 degrees F (37.2
to 37.7 degrees C), dry cough, and listlessness. Upon retrospective
questioning, his wife reported that he had showed mild personality changes
during the previous days. 6 days later, the patient awoke disoriented with
unsteady gait and slurred speech. He was evaluated in a local emergency
department and admitted to the hospital. Physical examination revealed mild
ataxia and confusion. Laboratory values were substantial for decreased
sodium. A lumbar puncture revealed a white blood cell count of 24/microL
(normal: 0 to 5 cells/microL), a red blood cell count of 10/microL (normal:
0 to 5 cells/microL), a glucose concentration of 58 mg/dL (normal: 40 to 70
mg/dL), and a protein concentration of 81 mg/dL (normal: 15 to 45 mg/dL).
An electroencephalogram demonstrated generalized slowing. Magnetic
resonance imaging of the brain was interpreted with a high T2 signal in the
hypothalamus and bilateral mesial temporal lobes.
The patient remained febrile and hyponatremic (range: 119 to 125 mmol/L)
with declining mental status. On the 5th day of hospitalization, the
patient was intubated, and twitching on his right side was noted. On day 6,
he was unresponsive and had near-constant myoclonic activity. On the 11th
day, a computerized tomography scan of the head showed sulcal effacement
and diffuse cerebral edema. The patient remained comatose and
intermittently febrile. Despite aggressive critical care management, the
patient died on the 14th hospital day.
At autopsy, histopathologic evaluation showed severe meningoencephalitis
involving the cortex and white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, deep
gray nuclei, cerebellum, and spinal cord. Brain tissue submitted to a
research laboratory was positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for
_Naegleria_.
The possibility of rabies was discussed briefly during hospitalization but
was discarded from further consideration on the basis of a review of the
history and clinical signs and symptoms. A brain biopsy was planned but was
canceled because of hemodynamic instability. Initial microscopic
examination of brain tissue did not detect any inclusions suggestive of
viral infection.
Tissues were forwarded to CDC for pathologic evaluation for _Naegleria_.
Immunohistochemical (IHC) assays for various amoebae, including _Naegleria
fowleri_, were negative. However, abundant intracytoplasmic inclusions of
neurons in several areas of the brain suggested a diagnosis of rabies. The
diagnosis was confirmed by IHC stains for rabies virus. Further testing,
including both indirect and direct fluorescent antibody tests and reverse
transcriptase-PCR of fixed brain tissue, supported the diagnosis of rabies.
Nucleotide sequence analysis and antigenic typing with monoclonal
antibodies on frozen brain tissue indicated that the specific etiologic
agent was a southeastern raccoon rabies virus variant. Genetic sequence
analysis indicated 100 percent homology with a raccoon rabies virus variant
from Virginia.
Approximately 125 family members and friends and 173 health-care workers
were questioned retrospectively about direct unprotected exposures to the
patient's secretions and tissues. After detailed investigation, 5 family
members and 3 hospital employees received post-exposure prophylaxis for
potential exposure to patient secretions.
The patient was an office worker who for the previous 6 years had lived,
worked, and recreated in areas in which raccoon rabies was endemic.
However, extensive interviews with family, friends, and co-workers revealed
that he had no specific exposure to terrestrial animals likely to be
infected with the raccoon rabies virus variant. The patient did not spend
much time outdoors, but the potential existed for encountering a rabid
mammal while camping or in a trash can, wood pile, or other outdoor
environment.
MMWR Editorial Note
-------------------
Approximately 7000 to 9000 cases of animal rabies are diagnosed annually in
the United States (1). This report describes the 1st documented case of
human rabies associated with a raccoon rabies virus variant. Of the 37
human rabies cases reported in the United States since 1990, no history of
suspicious animal bite exposure was documented for 28 of the 30 cases
presumed to be acquired in the United States. With the isolation of raccoon
rabies virus from this patient, human cases have been associated with all
of the major reservoirs and vectors of the disease in the United States,
including dogs, cats, bats, foxes, skunks, coyotes, and bobcats. Human
rabies cases without a definitive history of animal exposure are associated
commonly with bat rabies viruses (2). Challenges to implicating an animal
source readily can include failure to seek medical care for perceived minor
lesions, non-recognition of the actual exposure event, communication (i.e.,
language) barriers, and recall bias from memory loss or impaired speech in
encephalitic patients. Incubation periods range typically from 1 to 3
months after exposure but in rare cases can exceed 1 year in duration,
further complicating collection of an adequate history.
During the late 1970s, rabid raccoons were identified in Virginia and West
Virginia after probable translocation of infected animals from the
southeastern United States. Raccoon rabies spread throughout the region,
with approximately 50 000 rabid raccoons diagnosed to date. During 2003,
Tennessee became the 20th affected state, and the enzootic area now
stretches from eastern Canada to Florida (3).
Rabies should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any acute,
rapidly progressive encephalitis, regardless of documented history of
animal bite. Prompt ante- or postmortem diagnosis is necessary for accurate
reporting of human rabies to public health officials and implementation of
appropriate infection-control measures, including prompt administration of
prophylaxis to exposed persons.
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices publishes guidelines for
human rabies prevention (4), and recommendations have been published for
the management of suspected cases (5). Human rabies post-exposure
prophylaxis is effective when administered promptly and properly.
Human-to-human transmission is a concern, but no cases among health-care
workers exposed to a rabies patient have been reported (6,7). In the case
described in this report, careful risk assessment based on identifiable
contact with the patient's secretions limited the number of persons
receiving prophylaxis.
Emergency medicine physicians, infectious-disease consultants, and state
and national public health officials can provide advice on rabies
prophylaxis for complicated or unusual exposure scenarios to prevent this
fatal disease and aid in its diagnosis.
