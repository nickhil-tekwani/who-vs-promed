Emergency management warning 107: exotic Newcastle disease in the United States
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exotic Newcastle disease (END) was confirmed on 1 Oct 2002, in the state of
California and is now in the final phase of total eradication. No new
positive premises have been detected since 31 May 2003, and no new positive
commercial premises have been detected since 26 Mar. APHIS has also
recently taken the following significant regulatory actions:
1. A prohibition on the interstate and international movement of animals
for fighting, which directly addressed gamefowl movements for fighting, was
published in the Federal Register on 12 May 2003.
2. With the complete eradication of END in the states of Nevada and
Arizona, effective 14 May 2003, APHIS lifted federal quarantines on the 5
counties affected in Nevada and Arizona. Additionally, all Federal/State
emergency response incident command posts in the 2 states have been closed.
3. With the successful eradication of END in the single index premises in
Texas, the Federal/State incident command post in Socorro, TX, has also
been closed and the quarantine lifted on the 5 counties affected in Texas
and New Mexico.
APHIS is currently conducting END strategy meetings planning for final
eradication and surveillance activities. Although all indicators show that
END is nearing total eradication in the US, APHIS is still conducting an
enhanced national END surveillance program throughout the US.

Operational update
------------------
The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has declared an extraordinary
emergency for the states of Arizona, California, Nevada, Texas, and New
Mexico. These declarations allow USDA to apply federal authority within
Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, and Texas.
Effective 15 May 2003, operational activities at the Arizona Incident
Command were officially complete and the command was closed. Dr Dee Harris,
area veterinarian in charge will handle any remaining inquiries.
Effective 5 Jun 2003, APHIS removed Dona Ana, Luna, and Otero Counties, NM,
Hudspeth County, TX, and portions of El Paso County, TX, from the list of
quarantined areas. This action removes restrictions on the movement of
birds, poultry, and certain other articles from those areas.
The Incident Command Post in Texas has been closed. Operational activities
have been completed. Intra-county movement restrictions are to be removed
in El Paso County.
The Central California Incident Command Post closed 20 Jun 2003.
Outreach activities
-------------------
Currently, task force personnel field about 150 to 200 calls per week from
the public through the phone bank; the number tends to fluctuate with the
amount of interest generated in those communities undergoing surveillance
activities. California's END website:

[Essentially it appears that Newcastle disease in the US has been
eradicated. This is good news for the US and for its trading partners.
Understandably this will highlight any weak areas in how things were
handled. So identifying the "lessons learned" will continue for some time.
