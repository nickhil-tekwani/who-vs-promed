Four people have been admitted to an Indonesian hospital with bird flu
symptoms in an area of West Java [the village of Cikelet] that has seen a
series of confirmed and suspected cases in humans, officials said on Thu 31
Aug 2006.
At least 2 people in Cikelet, about 90 km (55 miles) south of the
provincial capital of West Java, Bandung, have been confirmed to have died
from the H5N1 virus in recent weeks.
"Three people with symptoms including breathlessness have been hospitalised
since last night at Dr Slamet hospital," said Hendi Budiman, head of
administration at the Garut Health Office, the district where Cikelet is
located. "They come from Cikelet. Two are neighbours, but they are not
related." Yogi Prayogi, a spokesman at Dr Slamet hospital, said blood
samples had been sent to Jakarta for testing.
"Three people showing symptoms will be allowed to return [home?] today. But
they will be monitored," he said, adding that the 3 lived around chickens
and dead fowl had been seen. He said an 8 year old boy with bird flu
symptoms had also been admitted to the hospital.
Indonesia has so far recorded 60 bird flu cases, 46 of them fatal. The
country's death toll is the highest in the world.
Separately, a local health ministry official said 3 out of 5 people
admitted to hospital on Indonesia's Sulawesi island this week with bird-flu
like symptoms were related. "Three are related, they are cousins," said Ida
Bagus Yadnya Putra, head of communicable disease control at the Health
Ministry in Central Sulawesi province. The official said that dead chickens
had been found around their homes. "They came to hospital to get medicine
but refused to stay for treatment. They didn't come to the hospital at the
same time. Now, they are getting better." Blood samples from the 5 had also
been sent to Jakarta for testing.
Fears that the virus had mutated into a form that could pass easily between
humans heightened in May 2006 when 7 people from an extended family died of
the disease in Indonesia's North Sumatra. Scientists worry that the H5N1
virus that has killed around 140 people and millions of birds since 2003 as
it spread from Asia to Europe and Africa could mutate into a strain that
could spark a human pandemic.
Indonesia has seen a steady increase in human bird flu deaths in 2006 and
the virus is endemic in poultry in nearly all of the provinces of the
sprawling archipelago. The country, which has been criticised for not doing
enough to stamp out H5N1, has shied away from mass culling of poultry so
far citing the expense and the logistical difficulties because of the
millions of backyard fowl.

[The apparent cluster of human cases at Cikelet, West Java, does not rival
the 7-case cluster of cases among extended family members in North Sumatra.
The number of confirmed human cases in Cikelet remains at 3 (see:
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2006_08_21/en/index.html>) and at least 3
previously suspected human cases appear to have been released from hospital.
According to WHO, a team of experts is presently in the Cikelet
sub-district investigating the outbreak and monitoring for further cases.
The Cikelet sub-district consists of around 20 isolated hamlets, each with
a population of 200 to 400 people, many living in large extended families.
The hamlets sit in a basin surrounded by steep mountains with rocky winding
paths best accessed by foot or horseback. Three hamlets are the focus of
investigation.
In this area, mortality from endemic diseases, especially malaria, is
common, access to health care is poor, and medical records of deaths are
scanty or non-existent. Prior to late June 2006, no mass die-offs of
poultry are known to have occurred in the area. As the population had no
experience with this disease, after June 2006 high-risk behaviours commonly
occurred during the disposal of carcasses or the preparation of sick or
dead birds for consumption. These exposures are considered at present to be
the source of infection for most confirmed or suspected cases. - Mod.CP]
