Suffolk bird flu outbreak: cull now complete
-------------------------------------------
Last night [5 Feb 2007] the culling operation at the Suffolk farm
where the avian flu outbreak occurred was completed. Defra's Deputy
Chief Veterinary Officer Fred Landeg said: "I am thankful for the
efforts of all involved in the culling operation and the swiftness
with which this large process was carried out."
Earlier in the day, Environment Secretary David Miliband made a
statement to Parliament about the Government's response to the
outbreak of avian flu at the Suffolk poultry farm. The State
Veterinary Service was contacted by a private veterinarian who
suspected an avian notifiable disease. Poultry found dead on the farm
was found to contain the highly pathogenic Asian strain of the H5N1
avian flu virus. Mr. Miliband reported on the legal restrictions in
place in the area around the farm, and on the humane slaughter of the
remaining birds on the farm. He referred to Defra's contingency
plans, which are updated regularly and available on Defra's website.
"Thus far they have proven their worth," he said. "Our goals are
clear: to stamp out the disease, to protect public health, to protect
animal heath and welfare, and to regain disease free status in the
UK. "I would like to record my thanks to all those who have worked so
hard since Thursday evening [1 Feb 2007] from across government
departments, delivery partners and the poultry industry at the local,
regional, and national level, to help achieve these goals as soon as possible."
A Protection Zone of a 3-km radius and a Surveillance Zone of 10 km
have been established around the premises: movement restrictions are
imposed and poultry must be isolated from wild birds. A wider
Restricted Zone has also been imposed, covering east Suffolk and
South East Norfolk bounded to the west and the north by the A140 and
A47 respectively, an area of approximately 2090 sq km. It requires
the isolation of poultry from wild birds, and requires movements to
be licensed. As further information becomes available the
restrictions in place may be adjusted.
Some movements restricted under the current rules may now be allowed
(subject to specific conditions) -- see the link to "General Movement
Licences"
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/notifiable/disease/ai/latest-situation/licence.htm>.
For all other moves, application should be made to the local Animal
Health Office. All bird gatherings -- including shows, markets and
fairs, and pigeon races -- have been banned nationwide (throughout
England, Scotland, and Wales) until further notice (this will be kept
under review as the disease situation develops).

EU says banning UK poultry export is unjustified
-------------------------------------------------
Any move to ban British poultry exports after an outbreak of the
highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu strain would be unjustified, the
European Commission said on Tuesday [6 Feb 2007]. "Any global ban on
the UK is totally disproportionate," a spokesman for the EU executive
told a regular briefing, adding it was satisfied with British
measures to contain the outbreak.
A number of countries have announced a ban on imports of British
poultry with others reportedly mulling over such a move. Earlier on
Tuesday [6 Feb 2007], South Korea and Hong Kong said they were
joining Russia and Japan in banning imports from Britain, while the
Financial Times reported that South Africa and Indonesia had followed
suit. EU member Ireland banned the import of poultry from Britain for
"gatherings and shows" as a precautionary measure. The ban does not
extend to British-ruled Northern Ireland.
The Commission said no further measures were planned at EU-level
following a meeting of the bloc's veterinary experts on Tuesday [6
Feb 2007]. "We are completely satisfied with the way the British
authorities reacted. They acted quickly once it was detected," the
spokesman said. "There is no need for a general ban ... trade should
continue within the internal market."
The spokesman said British officials had told an EU meeting in
Brussels it was unlikely the infection had come from Hungary, and
said that Britain had no plans for a widespread vaccination campaign.

EU vets review bird flu defences
-------------------------------
EU veterinary experts were reviewing Europe's defences against deadly
bird flu amid fears that the virus could spread across the 27-nation
bloc after an outbreak in Britain. British officials briefed their EU
counterparts about actions they have taken at a routine meeting in
Brussels of food safety and veterinarian experts. But a European
Commission spokesman said Tuesday [6 Feb 2007] "no new measures are planned".
The outbreak of the virulent H5N1 strain of bird flu on a British
turkey farm came just weeks after the deadly virus was discovered on
a goose farm in southeastern Hungary, the 1st detection of the
disease in the European Union since last August [2006]. "The
commission is satisfied with the speed and efficiency of the UK
response to the outbreak as soon as a significant number of deaths
started appearing," spokesman Michael Mann told journalists. "The
authorities started reacting promptly."
Britain completed on Monday [5 Feb 2007] the slaughter of about 160
000 turkeys to keep the virus from spreading and authorities are
investigating how it was transferred to the birds.
The European Union adopted in February 2006 procedures to be taken in
the event the virus is detected after 14 member states were hit with
bird flu, causing a sharp drop in poultry consumption. Under those
rules, authorities are supposed to set up a 3-km (1.8-mile)
protection zone and a 10-km surveillance zone around the site of an outbreak.
Meanwhile, infected birds are supposed to be culled, other farmers
are supposed to keep poultry indoors and strict movement controls are
supposed to be put in place.
Despite the British measures to contain the virus, Britain was
slapped with poultry import bans by Japan, Russia, and Ukraine while
France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden have stepped up
precautions to prevent the spread of the virus. The commission
spokesman stressed that "global bans" from non-EU countries on
British poultry were "not justified" and said EU measures were
sufficient. "We will do everything we can to help to make sure that
these bans, or to try and help the UK makes sure that these bans last
as short a period as possible, because they are not justified," Mann said.
EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou stressed on Monday [5 Feb
2007] that although other outbreaks among birds were likely in the
EU, a human pandemic was not about to sweep across the continent. "We
should remind ourselves that the virus is around so we will probably
have more outbreaks in the European Union in the future," he told
journalists. "We should look at it as an animal disease and should
not bring into the debate, even when there's an occasion, the issue
of a pandemic," Kyprianou said. "The possibility for a pandemic is a
totally separate issue."

As turkey cull ends ministers and farmers hope virus has not spread
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The government, farmers, and supermarkets were crossing their fingers
last night [Mon 5 Feb 2007] that the H5N1 outbreak on Bernard
Matthews's turkey farm in Suffolk was an isolated case and the lethal
disease had not spread further.
As the 200 cullers gassed the last of 159 000 turkeys at the farm and
no new suspicious deaths or illnesses were reported, the environment
secretary, David Miliband, told the Commons that the government had
reacted swiftly and efficiently, but still did not know how the
infection had arrived. He ruled out claims that it could have been
caused by chicks imported from Hungary. "In respect of the chicks,
they all came from within this country, so there is no Hungarian
connection. The fact is the factory involved in the Hungarian
outbreak is not a Bernard Matthews factory. "We have not dismissed
any suggestions. We are pursuing all possible avenues of inquiry. It
remains the case that the most likely reason or route of this problem
does lie in a link with the wild bird population, but that does not
mean we should not pursue any other avenues in a serious way with
full speed, and that is what we are doing."
EU health officials and MEPs said yesterday [Mon 5 Feb 2007] the
similarities of the outbreak with recent cases in Hungary indicated a
link. One official who has been in close contact with the UK
authorities confirmed that the H5N1 strain found in East Anglia was
"virtually identical" to 2 separate recent outbreaks among geese in
Hungary. He said that in both Hungarian outbreaks this year [2007]
there had been no evidence suggesting that the farmed birds were
infected by wild birds.
A spokesman for Bernard Matthews last night [Mon 5 Feb 2007] said
there was no link between the company's operations in Hungary and
Britain. Asked if all the eggs at his hatchery were British, the
spokesman said: "All the birds were British and no eggs have been
transported from Hungary."
Caroline Lucas, the Green party MEP, called for government research
into the links between large poultry companies and the spread of
avian flu around the world. "The government is ignoring a massive
amount of evidence that its spread is linked to farming practices,
not wild birds," she said. "These chicken houses are themselves viral
factory farms -- they are creating the virus there."
The RSPB [Royal Society for the Protection of Birds] also strongly
denied reports that H5N1 was now endemic in British wild birds, and
questioned government statements that wild birds were responsible for
the outbreak. "They are one of the options, but this outbreak does
not fit with the international movements of birds at this time.
Thousands of live birds have been tested in the last year as part of
government research into avian flu, but none have been found to have
the disease."
Adriano Guedes, consultant for the GMB Migrant Worker's Project in
Suffolk, said the 60 Portuguese workers employed to catch the turkeys
since the outbreak were being paid BPS18 an hour and were working
12-hour shifts. "Some are concerned about illness, but they've been
told the danger is minimal. On Saturday [3 Feb 2007] they were
offered 200 percent pay -- 300 percent at the weekend - and some
extra days off to help catch the birds. They're provided with
protective clothing and given a pill to take each day."
Heather Peck, regional operations director leading the state
veterinary service's investigation, said it could be days before her
officers arrive at a "most likely" explanation of how the virus
penetrated the steel sheds. "It's a forensic examination. We're
following up every possible movement. We already know the birds
arrived before the disease, because of the incubation period. So the
flock caught the disease on the farm. They were brought on to the
farm as one-day-old chicks. Those birds are now 4 weeks old."
Russia, Macedonia, Japan, South Korea, South Africa, Hong Kong, and
Jersey have banned British poultry imports, and other countries have
imposed restrictions on their flocks to try to minimise the risk of
the H5N1 infection spreading. The Netherlands and Norway ordered all
poultry to be taken indoors or to be secured. Ireland banned some
imports and France ordered an investigation of the risks.
UK supermarkets reported only a slight dip in poultry sales after the
outbreak. Tesco said it had seen a "single digit" percentage drop
across its fresh and frozen poultry products. "There hasn't been a
huge effect, but yes, there is an inevitable dip," a spokeswoman
said. But Waitrose and Marks & Spencer said news of the disease had
had no impact on sales. "To date there has been no impact on poultry
sales. Our customers understand this is not a food safety issue,"
said a Waitrose spokesman.
