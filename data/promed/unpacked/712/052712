SARS-CoV-2, Russia
------------------
Information received on [and dated] Tue 26 May 2020 from Dr. Nikolay Vlasov, Deputy Head, Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance , Ministry of Agriculture, Moscou, Russia

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 18 May 2020
Date of confirmation of the event: 22 May 2020
Reason for notification: emerging disease
Morbidity: 1 (scale 0 to 5)
Mortality: 0 (scale 0 to 5)
Zoonotic impact: No
Causal agent: SARS-CoV-2

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Moskva, Moskovskaya Oblast [Moskva]
Date of start of the outbreak: 18 May 2020
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: other
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cats / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cats / 100 / 0 / 0 / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive.

Epidemiological comments: To perform laboratory tests biomaterial samples (throat and nasal swabs) were taken from a 5-year-old cat to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. The lab tests were performed using RT-PCR in real time. Additionally, a RT-PCR was performed with electrophoretic detection of amplification products. The obtained amplification reaction product was sequenced using selected specific primers flanking a 232 bp N gene fragment (ORF1ab) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The tests showed 100% identity of the analyzed fragment of the sequence of the N gene ORF1ab of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Currently, the animal is quarantined at the place of keeping.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; quarantine; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Federal State Budgetary Institution, Russian State Center for Animal Feed and Drug Standardization and Quality (Regional Laboratory) / Cat / Real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 22 May 2020 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Although the immediate notification did not indicate whether the cat was in close contact with a person known or suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, it most likely was.

Subscribers are encouraged to read the OIE's Questions and Answers information on COVID-19, last updated Mon 18 May 2020 https://www.oie.int/en/scientific-expertise/specific-information-and-recommendations/questions-and-answers-on-2019novel-coronavirus/. The following is sourced from that information:

"Now that SARS-CoV-2 infections are widely distributed in the human population, there is a possibility for certain animal species to become infected through close contact with infected humans. Infection of animals with SARS-CoV-2 may have implications for animal health and welfare, for wildlife conservation, and for biomedical research.

Dogs, cats (domestic and large cats), and minks have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the field setting, following close contact with humans known or suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Studies are underway to better understand the susceptibility of different animal species to SARS-CoV-2 and to assess infection dynamics in susceptible animal species. To date, preliminary findings from experimental infection studies suggest that poultry and pigs are not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Findings from laboratory studies suggest that, of the animal species investigated so far, cats are the most susceptible species for SARS-CoV-2, and cats can be affected with clinical disease. In an experimental laboratory setting cats were able to transmit infection to other cats. In the laboratory setting ferrets were susceptible to infection and able to transmit infection to other ferrets, although they appear to be less affected by clinical disease. Ferrets might serve as a useful model for future studies e.g. to evaluate vaccines or therapeutics. Golden Syrian hamsters, as well as cynomolgus and rhesus macaques can be consistently infected by SARS-CoV-2 and may show clinical signs. Dogs appear to be susceptible to infection but appear to be less affected than ferrets or cats. Egyptian fruit bats were also infected in the laboratory setting but did not show signs of disease. The infected fruit bats were able to transmit infection to other fruit bats.

The current spread of COVID-19 is a result of human to human transmission. To date, there is no evidence that animals play an epidemiologically relevant role in spreading the human disease. Therefore, there is no justification in taking measures directed at animals, particularly companion animals, which may compromise their welfare".
