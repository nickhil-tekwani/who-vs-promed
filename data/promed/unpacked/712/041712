Situation update
----------------
Between 31 Jul 2020 and 6 Aug 2020, no cases were reported by the EU Member States or the EU neighbouring countries. However, Greece notified the death of a case reported during the past weeks. It is the 1st death associated to West Nile virus (WNV) infection of the season.

Since the beginning of the 2020 transmission season and as of 6 Aug 2020, EU Member States have reported 12 human cases of WNV infection: Greece (10 cases, including one death) and Romania (2 cases). All cases were reported from areas that have been affected during previous transmission seasons. No cases have been reported from EU neighbouring countries.

During the current transmission season, one outbreak among equids has been reported by Portugal, and no outbreaks among birds have been reported through the Animal Disease Notification System of the European Commission.

Situation update
----------------
Between 7 and 13 Aug 2020, Greece reported 18 additional human cases of WNV infection, and Italy reported its 1st 2 cases. Greece also reported 5 additional deaths.

Since the beginning of the 2020 transmission season and as of 13 Aug 2020, EU Member States have reported 32 human cases of WNV infection through the European Surveillance System (TESSy): Greece (28 cases, including 6 deaths), Italy (2 cases), and Romania (2 cases). All cases were reported from areas that have been affected during previous transmission seasons. No cases have been reported from EU neighbouring countries.

In addition, the public health authorities of Andalucia, Spain, announced the occurrence of an outbreak of WNV infections with 12 laboratory-confirmed cases in the province of Seville. Additional patients with meningoencephalitis are currently being tested. Those cases were not yet reported through TESSy and are therefore not represented on the maps.

Since the beginning of the 2020 transmission season, 5 outbreaks among equids have been reported by Spain (3 outbreaks, among which one is in the province of Seville), Portugal (one outbreak), and Italy (one outbreak) through the Animal Disease Notification System (ADNS) of the European Commission. No outbreaks among birds have been reported through ADNS.

The health authority in the southern Spanish region of Andalusia on Thursday [13 Aug 2020] confirmed that 11 cases of West Nile virus have been detected in the region.

The cases of West Nile virus were confirmed by the head of the Andalusian health service, Jesus Aguirre, after tests were carried out on 19 people thought to be infected by meningoencephalitis -- a viral condition that resembles both meningitis and encephalitis -- in the towns of Puebla del Rio and Coria del Rio in Seville province.

17 of the 19 people infected have needed hospital treatment, with Spanish TV network RTVE reporting that 7 are in intensive care.

Aguirre explained that the health authority will now activate protocols to fight the _Aedes japonicus_ mosquito, which is the transmitter of this disease in the region. [This is erroneous information; see moderator comment discussion below].

Both Puebla del Rio and Coria del Rio are on the banks of the slow-moving River Guadalquivir, and the 42 000 inhabitants of both towns have been advised to do all they can to avoid contact with mosquitoes.

West Nile virus is the cause of a disease that is transmitted to people mainly by mosquito bites which can also affect birds, horses, and other mammals. According to the World Health Organization, around 80 percent of infected people do not experience symptoms, while the remaining 20 percent do manifest symptoms, which can be as serious as inflammation of the brain or surrounding tissues, with one percent of cases leading to death.

From: Ursula Hofle [in Spanish, trans. Mod.MPP, edited]


WNV has been endemic in this region of Spain for at least 2 decades. It is usually transmitted in this zone by mosquitoes of the genera _Culex_, especially _Culex pipiens_ and _Culex [perexiquus]_.

Thus, it is not as a result of an introduction by migratory birds, nor the presence of _Aedes japonicus_.

No proof exists that the vector responsible for this outbreak is the invading species mosquito _Aedes japonicus_. This mosquito has not been detected in Andalucia.

The known vectors for WNV in Andalucia are 2 species of local mosquitos from the genus Culex: _Culex perexifuus_ and _Culex pipiens_. In both species, the virus has been identified on numerous occasions in the zone, which has been monitored for years to detect this virus and other arboviruses (see bibliography at the end, refs. 1 and 2)

- In the following phrase: "...this mosquito bites migratory birds that have arrived at the referred to zone with the virus," the post gives a false notion that the outbreak was caused by migratory birds that had brought the virus directly in their migration, "looking like it" is in the zone. The vectors that transmit this virus bit the birds, migratory or non-migratory, and the virus can be carried by birds from one location to another, which favors its geographic expansion. What is certain is that the virus -- although originally arriving in this zone transported by infected birds -- arrived years ago, because it has circulated in this area from at least 2003, as proven from different scientific studies (refs. 3-10), having adapted to local birds, where the virus maintains its circulation in an enzootic cycle that involves birds and mosquitos, in both cases local.

In the same phrase, it is stated that "...the contamination between birds is through feces and air." This is another erroneous statement. The principle route of transmission of the virus is through arthropod vectors, specifically mosquitos. There is no proof of an airborne route or fecal route in the transmission of the virus.

Definitively, in order for an outbreak to occur in this zone, there is no need for either invasive mosquitos or migratory birds. We have had the virus here for years and annually have outbreaks in horses and, less frequently, in humans.

ProMED thanks Ursula Hofle and Miguel Angel Jimenez Clavero for their corrections and clarifications.

WNV is endemic in the region, and _Culex perexifuus_ and _Culex pipiens_ -- not _Aedes japonicus_ as claimed in the media article -- are its vectors.

In summary, the article incorrectly attributed the vector species. The Spanish experts have also shared references to some useful publications, providing further evidence on the subject. - Mod.UBA
