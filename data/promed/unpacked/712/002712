The 13 and 9 year old sisters [from Clovis, Fresno county] were active and healthy kids with no medical history. Their parents thought it was a terrible case of the flu. Originally their pediatrician thought it was the norovirus. But after days of worsening symptoms, they were admitted to Valley Children's Hospital [in Madera county] with _E. coli_.

The 13-year-old is finally starting to improve after 16 days in the hospital. She's had more blood transfusions than she can count along with excruciating stomach pain and she was hallucinating. The sisters were diagnosed with _E. coli_ HUS [hemolytic uremic syndrome] but the girls had "unique" cases. Dr Molly Dorfman said, "Their cases were pretty atypical. Particularly the younger sister's case was very, very severe."

This form of bacteria usually originate from contaminated food products. Pinpointing the exact source has been difficult. They haven't traveled anywhere recently. The family hadn't eaten out lately. It is likely other family members also ate what the girls did but did not become violently ill. Even more puzzling, the girls rarely eat the same things. "Which is why we can't figure out what it would have been. The sisters have very different tastes in food, there aren't a lot of foods that they like in common, so it narrows things down quite a bit more."

The younger sister's kidneys still are not working. She has been debilitated by toxins from the infection, and at one point couldn't wake up. Both sisters have had blood transfusion and dialysis.

[These organisms are currently the most common cause of acute renal function in children in the USA related to the Shiga toxin-related hemolytic uremic syndrome. In most cases, even if hemodialysis is required, the kidney injury resolves, but some cases can result in permanent kidney failure and the need for long term hemodialysis. Most of the mortality related to HUS occurs when central nervous systems intervene such as seizures, altered mental status, and ischemic events.

It appears that both sisters became ill in the same timeframe so sister-to-sister transmission cannot be used to explain to question of a common food vehicle. No information is given regarding potentially non-food related transmission such as visiting a petting zoo.

Direct contact with the animals is not required to be infected as the environment around the livestock can be the vehicle for transmission. Indeed, cases of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) illness have occurred linked to buildings a week or more after a petting zoo had been in them, with the outbreak strain still found in the environment 42 weeks after the event, underscoring the need for adequate decontamination of such sites (Varma JK, Greene KD, Reller ME, et al. An outbreak of _E. coli_ O157 following exposure to a contaminated building. JAMA 2003; 290(20): 2709-12; available at http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=197687). - Mod.LL
