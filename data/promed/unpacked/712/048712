10.1094/PD-89-0684B. Accepted for publication 16 Mar 2005.
The Asian soybean rust caused by the fungus _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ was
cited for the 1st time in Argentina during the 2002-2003 growing season
(3). During 2003-2004, the disease spread to other northern provinces and
was also observed in north-central Santa Fe, the main producing soybean
province of the country. Because the disease appeared at the end of the
crop growing season (late March to early April) it had little or no impact
on crop yields.
The objectives of this study were to characterize morphologically and
pathometrically the disease on soybean and check the presence of _P.
pachyrhizi_ on volunteer soybean plants that could eventually carry the
disease to the next growing season. The study was conducted in the San
Justo Department, Santa Fe Province (between 30 and 31 deg S latitude),
where the presence of the soybean rust was molecularly confirmed by Sistema
Nacional Vigilancia y Monitoreo (on-line publication at
<http://www.sinavimo.gov.ar>).
3 field locations were sampled and identified as M1, M2, and M3.
Transversal cuts of soybean leaves through rust lesions and
histo-pathological staining were used for micromorphologic characterization
of the developmental stages of _P. pachyrhizi_.
The disease incidence was estimated as the proportion of affected soybean
plants and leaves. Average severity, expressed as the percentage of leaf
area affected, including chlorosis, was measured on the terminal leaflet of
leaves sampled from the lower 1/3 of the canopy. 3 replicates of 10 plants,
randomly chosen, were used. The number of uredinia per square centimeter
and per lesion (symptomatic foliar area showing chlorosis and necrosis
caused by the fungus) was measured on the undersides of the sampled
leaflets at 40x magnification (1).
Typical signs and symptoms of _P. pachyrhizi_ coexisted on soybean leaves
with brown spot (_Septoria glycines_), downy mildew (_Peronospora
manshurica_), anthracnose (_Colletotrichum truncatum_), and blight and leaf
spot (_Cercospora kikuchii_) and also with bacteria (_Pseudomonas_ and
_Xanthomonas_ spp.). Uredinia and telia of the _P. pachyrhizi_ cycle were
observed. Uredinia were also observed on soybean petioles.
The average size of urediniospores (n = 60) was 23.3 x 16.6 micrometers.
Telia were located adjacent to the uredinia. These telia were dark and
crusty with 4 stacked layers of teliospores. Rust incidence in plants was
100 for the 3 fields, while the incidence in leaves was 100 percent for M1
and M2 and 60 percent for M3. Average disease severity was 50.3, 25.6, and
14.8 percent for M1, M2, and M3, respectively.
The mean number of uredinia per square centimeter was 327, 179, and 177,
for M1, M2, and M3, respectively. The number of uredinia per lesion ranged
from 1 to 6. _P. pachyrhizi_ was also found on volunteer soybean plants
that emerged shortly after harvest. On 40 leaflets, the foliar incidence
was 25 percent, showing 1-2 lesions with 1-2 uredinios per leaflet (2).
The volunteer soybean plants could constitute a potential early source of
inoculum.

[The Asian strain of soybean rust (ASR) appears to be firmly entrenched in
Santa Fe Province. ASR-Infected volunteer soybean plants are a matter of
concern as the authors point out. All commercial soybean varieties
available today are susceptible to ASR. The only management option
remaining for producers is application of approved fungicides. -Mod.DH]
