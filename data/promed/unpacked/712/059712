Another Morris County [New Jersey] horse has tested positive for the serious, but rare, neurological disease that results form infection by the eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] virus. The 3 year old gelding had not been vaccinated against EEE, and was euthanized on 23 Aug 2016.

EEE causes inflammation of the brain tissue and has a significantly higher risk of death in horses than West Nile virus infection. West Nile virus is a viral disease that affects horses' neurological system. Both diseases are transmitted by mosquito bite. The virus cycles between birds and mosquitoes, with horses and humans being incidental hosts.

The Morris County horse is the 2nd to have tested posted, and been consequently euthanized. It is currently the peak season for transmission of the virus by infected mosquitoes.

A 2 month old unvaccinated filly from Forest County is the 1st reported Wisconsin horse to have become infected with eastern equine encephalitis this year [2016]. The filly was euthanized on 23 Aug 2016.

Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection spokesperson Raechelle Belli describes the disease: "Those mosquitoes bite an animal with EEE, then they take it back to an avian (bird) host where it's concentrated, then the mosquito takes it to other animals or humans," said Belli. "The horses can suffer several signs, including depression, appetite loss, drooping of eyelids and lower lips, fever, paralysis, and in 90 per cent of cases it's fatal."

Belli says humans infected often have flu-like symptoms, and the best preventative [measure] is to have horses vaccinated and to take standard precautions to limit mosquitoes in a given area, such as getting rid of standing water.

Wisconsin last experienced a major outbreak in 2011, with more than 30 cases mostly in North Central Wisconsin. Because the disease follows mosquito populations, it normally begins in mid- to late summer and remains a threat until the 1st killing frost.

["Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is a member of the genus Alphavirus, family Togaviridae. Other medically important alphaviruses found in the Americas include western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV). EEEV has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome. The virus particles are spherical and have a diameter of 60-65 nm. Of the 4 lineages of EEEV, Group I is endemic in North America and the Caribbean and causes most human disease cases; the other 3 groups (IIA, IIB, and III) cause primarily equine illness in Central and South America." http://www.cdc.gov/EasternEquineEncephalitis/tech/virus.html

Wild birds are the reservoir hosts, and the black-tailed mosquito, _Culiseta melanura_, is the vector in swamps. Other mosquito species may act as bridge vectors, carrying the virus out of swamps into adjoining localities and transmitting the virus to humans prior to vector season in the spring. In animals at high risk or with limited immunity, more frequent vaccination or appropriately timed vaccination is recommended in order to induce protective immunity during periods of likely exposure. In areas where mosquitoes are active year-round, many veterinarians elect to vaccinate horses at 6 month intervals to ensure uniform protection throughout the year, although this practice is not specifically recommended by manufacturers of vaccines.

"Adult horses, previously unvaccinated against EEE/WEE or of unknown vaccination history: administer a primary series of 2 doses with a 3 or 4 to 6 week interval between doses. Revaccinate prior to the onset of the next vector season and annually thereafter.

"Pregnant mares, previously vaccinated against EEE/WEE: vaccinate 4 to 6 weeks before foaling.

"Pregnant mares, unvaccinated or having unknown vaccinal history: immediately begin a 2-dose primary series with a 3 or 4 week interval between doses. Booster at 4 to 6 weeks before foaling or prior to the onset of the next vector season -- whichever occurs 1st.

"Foals of mares vaccinated against EEE/WEE in the pre-partum period: administer a primary 3-dose series beginning at 4 to 6 months of age. A 3 or 4 to 6 week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses is recommended. The 3rd dose should be administered at 10 to 12 months of age, prior to the onset of the next mosquito season.

"In the south eastern US, due to earlier seasonal disease risk, vaccination may be started at 2 to 3 months of age. When initiating vaccinations in younger foals, a series of 4 primary doses should be administered, with a 3 or 4 week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses and a 4 week interval between the 2nd and 3rd doses. The 4th dose should be administered at 10 to 12 months of age, prior to the onset of the next mosquito season.

"Foals of unvaccinated mares or having unknown vaccinal history: administer a primary series of 3 doses with a 30 day interval between the 1st and 2nd doses and a 60 day [8 week] interval between the 2nd and 3rd doses. The primary series of vaccinations should be initiated at 3 to 4 months of age and, where possible, be completed prior to the onset of the high-risk insect vector season. If the primary series is initiated during the mosquito vector season, an interval of 3 to 4 weeks between the 2nd and 3rd doses is preferable to the interval of 8 weeks described above.

"Horses having been naturally infected and recovered: recovered horses likely develop lifelong immunity. Consider revaccination only if the immune status of the animal changes the risk for susceptibility to infection. Examples of these conditions would include the long-term use of corticosteroids and pituitary adenoma."
