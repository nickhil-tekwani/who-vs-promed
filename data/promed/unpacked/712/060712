Extraordinary measures had been taken in two Russian regions in connection
with a menace of the foot-and-mouth disease spreading.

The Far East (Dalnevostochniy) regional center of the Ministry on Emergency
Situation in Vladyvostok reported that an outbreak of the foot-and-mouth
disease had begun at the pig farm in Elitnoye village, Primorskiy kray
(region) on 10 April 2000. All infected animals (229 pigs) were killed
(euthanised) and cremated. At the experimental farm "Stepnoye" 965 pigs,
the total herd, were killed; and two private cattle were also killed. All
the rest of the cattle were immunized against the disease. All killed
animals were buried in the cattle-grave, keeping strictly to the sanitary
norms. The cattle-grave is protected so that carnivora cannot penetrate
into it.
According to the reports from Barnaul at the Altai Territory (kray) there
is serious danger of the foot-and-mouth disease spreading from the
neighbouring Kazakhstan territory. The regional veterinary service informed
that the flow of all kinds of animal raw materials and products was stopped
from the neighbouring Republic to Altai. At the border 8 special posts were
organized, and customs and militia officials are involved. Cattle killings
at the private farms were limited, the sanitary cordons were organized, and
mass animal vaccination had begun in order to prevent the establishment of
infectious foci.

China stops imports of pork, mutton and other meats from Russia on May 15
because of an outbreak of foot-and- mouth disease in the Russian Far
Eastern Ussuriisk and Primorye regions. The Chinese State Sanitary
Inspection said it would use penalties up to criminal proceedings against
violators of this decision.

[At this time we have no formal OIE confirmation of FMD in northern
Kazakhstan, only this indirect statement of risk from Russia. China borders
Kazakhstan in the west and Russia at various places along its northern
border. There is a severe FMD outbreak in southern Mongolia at this time. -
