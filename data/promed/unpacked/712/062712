["Virulent Newcastle disease (vND), formerly known as exotic Newcastle disease, is a contagious and fatal viral disease affecting the respiratory, nervous and digestive systems of birds and poultry. The disease is so virulent that many birds and poultry die without showing any clinical signs.

"vND is not a food safety concern. No human cases of Newcastle disease have ever occurred from eating poultry products. Properly cooked poultry products are safe to eat. In very rare instances, people working directly with sick birds can become infected with mild symptoms.

"vND has not been found in commercial poultry in the USA since 2003.

"Since [18 May 2018], USDA has confirmed 150 cases of vND in California, [with] 97 in San Bernardino County, 21 in Riverside County, 31 in Los Angeles County and 1 in Ventura County."
