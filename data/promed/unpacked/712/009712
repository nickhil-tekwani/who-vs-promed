DIPHTHERIA - REPUBLIC OF GEORGIA
================================
Date: 16 May 1996 -0400
From:<curatio@access.sanet.ge>
[The delay in posting is much regretted - Mod.JW]

We intend regular provision of information about emerging diseases since June.
[Your June report will be posted promptly - Mod.JW]
At the present the only reliable information we possess is the diphtheria
outbreak in Georgia, particularly in Ajara (the Western region at the Black Sea
adjacent to Turkey).
Despite the vaccination campaign 29 cases were reported
in February-March 1996. Of these 29 cases in Ajara, 26 (89.6%) had
received at least one booster dose of diphtheria toxoid vaccine in the mass
vaccination campaign.
