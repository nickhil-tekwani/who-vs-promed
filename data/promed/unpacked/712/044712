Update: Novel Influenza A (H1N1) Virus Infections --- Worldwide, 6 May 2009
-----------------------------------------------
Since mid-April 2009, CDC, state and local health authorities in the
United States, the World Health Organization (WHO), and health
ministries in several countries have been responding to an outbreak
of influenza caused by a novel influenza A (H1N1) virus (1). In March
and early April 2009, Mexico experienced outbreaks of respiratory
illness subsequently confirmed by CDC and Canada to be caused by the
novel virus. The influenza strain identified in U.S. patients was
genetically similar to viruses isolated from patients in Mexico (2).
Since recognition of the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus in Mexico and
the United States, as of 6 May 2009, a total of 21 additional
countries had reported cases, with a total of 1882 confirmed cases
worldwide. Several WHO member states are conducting ongoing
investigations of this worldwide outbreak, and WHO is monitoring and
compiling surveillance data and case reports. On 29 Apr 2009, WHO
raised the level of pandemic alert from phase 4 to phase 5,
indicating that human-to-human spread of the virus had occurred in at
least 2 countries in one WHO region. This report provides an update
of the initial investigations and spread of novel influenza A (H1N1)
virus worldwide.

Mexico:
Since implementing enhanced surveillance on 17 Apr 2009, the number
of suspected cases has increased rapidly, along with hospitalizations
for severe acute respiratory illness [These data are presented as a
figure in the original text.]. As of 5 May 2009, using an updated
case definition of fever plus cough or sore throat for a suspected
case and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(rRT-PCR) or viral culture for a laboratory-confirmed case, Mexico
had identified 11 932 suspected cases and 949* cases of
laboratory-confirmed novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection,
including 42 patients who died. Cases with laboratory-confirmed
infection have been identified in 27 of 31 Mexican states and the
Federal District. Confirmed cases in Mexico and in the United States
have a similar age distribution [data tabulated in the original
text]. Information is available on the clinical course of illness for
22 patients with laboratory-confirmed illness who were hospitalized,
including 7 patients who died. Five of the 15 surviving patients and
one of the 7 patients who died had underlying chronic medical
conditions. Additional details on the clinical signs and symptoms of
these and other patients are being collected. Among patients with
confirmed cases for whom information was available, 56 (98 percent)
of 57 reported fever, 49 (94 percent) of 52 reported cough, 23 (79
percent) of 29 reported dyspnea, 35 (80 percent) of 44 reported
headache, and 34 of (83 percent) 41 reported rhinorrhea. The
government of Mexico has instituted several measures to slow disease
transmission and reduce mortality, including closure of all schools
and avoidance of large public gatherings, distribution of oseltamivir
to all health-care units, publication of specific clinical
guidelines, and establishment of a call center to educate members of
the public who are seeking health-care information.

United States:
After recognition of the 1st cases of infection with the novel
influenza A (H1N1) virus, CDC and state health departments initiated
enhanced surveillance measures to identify additional cases. As of 6
May 2009, a total of 1487 confirmed and probable cases had been
reported from 43 states, including 642 confirmed cases (reported from
41 states) and 845 probable cases (reported from 42 states). Current
experience with laboratory testing results indicates that the
probability of laboratory confirmation for probable cases is greater
than 99 percent. States with the most confirmed cases are Illinois
(122 cases), New York (97), California (67), Texas (61), and Arizona
(48). Dates of illness onset for patients with confirmed or probable
illness range from 28 Mar to 4 May 2009 [data presented as a figure
in the original text], although the most recent case counts do not
account for testing and reporting delays. Among persons with
laboratory-confirmed illness, 35 hospitalized patients have been
reported from 16 states, including 2 patients from Texas who died,
both with underlying medical conditions. The age distribution of
persons with laboratory-confirmed disease ranged from 3 months to 81
years [data presented as a table in the original text]. A total of 18
patients were aged less than 2 years, and 31 were aged 2-4 years.

The age distribution of the 35 laboratory-confirmed hospitalized
patients ranged from 6 months to 53 years (median: 15 years). Among
patients with confirmed disease for whom data were available, 262 (90
percent) of 292 reported fever, 249 (84 percent) of 296 reported
cough, 176 (61 percent) of 290 reported sore throat, 65 (26 percent)
of 249 reported diarrhea, and 54 (24 percent) of 221 reported vomiting.

Other Countries:
On 26 Apr 2009, the 1st cases of novel influenza A (H1N1) virus
infection outside of the United States and Mexico were reported in
Canada. As of 6 May 2009, WHO had reported that 309 persons with
laboratory-confirmed disease had been identified in 21 countries
other than Mexico and the United States. Confirmed cases have been
reported from Asia (Hong Kong S.A.R. and Korea), the Pacific region
(New Zealand), the Middle East (Israel), Europe, and Central and
South America (El Salvador, Costa Rica, Colombia, and Guatemala)
[information presented as a map in the original text].

Of 178 patients for whom travel history was available, 145 (82
percent) reported recent travel to Mexico, and 4 (2 percent) reported
travel to the United States. Among those who had not traveled to
Mexico, 17 (52 percent) reported contact with a returning traveler
from Mexico. Canada, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom all have
reported evidence of in-country, 2nd-generation, human-to-human
transmission (e.g., a health-care worker in Germany who had cared for
a patient with a confirmed infection). No reports have been made of
sustained, community-wide transmission in affected countries.
Consistent with cases in North America, most of the cases reported
from other countries have been among young adults, with a median age
of 27.1 years (range: 2-62 years, N=45). The majority of cases in
other countries have been uncomplicated, and no deaths have been
reported; 4 patients have been hospitalized.

MMWR Editorial Note:
Early surveillance data from this outbreak suggest that the novel
influenza A (H1N1) virus has the potential for efficient, rapid
spread among countries. Although the illness associated with
infection generally seems self-limited and uncomplicated, a
substantial number of cases of severe disease and death have been
reported in previously healthy young adults and children. Several
characteristics of this outbreak appear unusual compared with a
typical influenza seasonal outbreak. 1st, the percentage of patients
requiring hospitalization appears to be higher than would be expected
during a typical influenza season (3). 2nd, the age distribution of
hospitalizations for novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection is
different than that of hospitalizations for seasonal influenza, which
typically occur among children aged less than 2 years, adults aged
greater than or equal to 65 years, and persons with chronic health
conditions (3). In Mexico and the United States, the percentage of
patients requiring hospitalization has been particularly high among
persons aged 30-44 years.

Two deaths have been reported in the United States, resulting in a
preliminary case-fatality rate of 0.2 percent among patients with
laboratory-confirmed disease. However, such case-fatality rates
should be viewed with caution. The actual case-fatality rate is
difficult to ascertain in a rapidly evolving outbreak, because an
unknown proportion of currently infected patients might die;
denominators might be uncertain because of unreported cases, and
groups at high risk for death from seasonal influenza (e.g., older
adults and patients with chronic disease) might not yet have been
exposed to the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus.

Summertime influenza outbreaks in temperate climates have been
reported in closed communities such as prisons, nursing homes, cruise
ships, and other settings with close contact (4, 5,6,7,8). Such
outbreaks typically do not result in community-wide transmission, but
they can be important indicators of viruses likely to circulate in
the upcoming influenza season (8). The novel influenza A (H1N1) virus
has been circulating in North America largely after the peak
influenza transmission season. For that reason, the epidemiology and
severity of the upcoming influenza season in the southern hemisphere
or in the northern hemisphere cannot be predicted. The imminent onset
of the season for influenza virus transmission in the southern
hemisphere, coupled with detection of confirmed cases in several
countries in the southern zone, raise concern that spread of novel
influenza A (H1N1) virus might result in large-scale outbreaks during
upcoming months. Countries in the southern hemisphere that are
entering the influenza season should anticipate outbreaks and enhance
surveillance accordingly. Influenza virus can circulate year round in
tropical regions; therefore, these countries should maintain enhanced
surveillance for novel influenza A (H1N1) virus.

Studies in countries affected by the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus
should help guide surveillance, case management, and prevention
strategies in countries not yet affected. Key concerns that should be
addressed in these studies include: Assessment of the potential
impact on public health; clinical progression of disease, including
rates and types of complications for different age and risk groups;
and information on virus transmissibility. Assessment of potential
disease severity associated with this novel virus will help inform
decisions on prevention strategies to slow the spread of infection.
Effective control measures will depend on the ability of national
governments to quickly gather and share virologic, epidemiologic, and
clinical information from multiple sources as new cases appear.

[2] Alberta swine incident
Date: Wed 6 May 2009
From: The Canadian Press [edited]


Canada's chief public health officer says the people who live on an
Alberta pig farm where pigs were found to be infected with swine flu
have tested negative for the virus.

A number of people living on the unidentified pig farm experienced
flu-like symptoms after the pigs fell ill and were tested to see
whether they too were infected. But Dr. David Butler-Jones says tests
suggest the people were not infected with the H1N1 swine virus.
Butler-Jones says, though, that there may have been "sampling
issues," and blood samples from the people will be tested for
antibodies to look for a definitive answer on whether they were
infected. He won't say how many people were tested or what he means
by sampling issues.

The pigs are thought to have been infected by a worker who had been
in Mexico and was ill on his return to work in mid-April 2009. The
unidentified carpenter also tested negative for the virus, but it is
believed that that is because he was too far along in his recovery to
be still shedding virus. A nasal swab from the man was only collected
after the pigs started falling sick, and that was more than 10 days
after his return from Mexico. Officials intend to test his blood too,
looking for antibodies to the new H1N1 swine flu virus.

The antibody test was developed at Canada's National Microbiology
Laboratory, which has played a key role in the investigation into
this new flu virus. It was the Winnipeg lab that determined that an
unusual outbreak of severe respiratory illness in Mexico was being
caused by a new swine flu virus U.S. researchers had found was
infecting people in the United States.

On Wednesday [6 May 2009], Canadian officials announced the Winnipeg
lab had completed full virus sequencing of 3 sample viruses, 2 from
Canadian swine flu cases and one from Mexico. They say the viruses
are virtually identical. The full genetic sequences of viruses
retrieved from the pigs have not yet been completed. That work is
being done at the National Centre for Foreign Animal Diseases, the
National Microbiology Laboratory's animal health counterpart. The 2
labs are co-located.

Experts will be keen to study the genetic sequences of the viruses
isolated from the pigs to determine whether there are any mutations
that arose when the virus went back into swine. Butler-Jones says the
sequences of those viruses will be posted in open access databases
once the work is done.

[It is reassuring to learn that the virus causing illness in pigs on
the Albertan farm has (probably) not been transmitted to people
living on the farm. The pigs are thought to have been infected by a
worker who had been in Mexico and who was ill upon his return to work
in mid-April 2009. This person is now virus-negative, and it is
unclear from this report whether the virus recovered from the sick
pigs is identical to the virus carried by the farm worker.
Clarification is awaited. The failure of the swine virus to transmit
back to people suggests that the novel H1N1 virus causing human
illness did not come into the human population directly from swine. - Mod.CP]
