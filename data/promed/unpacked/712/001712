While a new vaccine has all but eradicated common causes of
pneumonia, meningitis, and ear infections in children, new strains of
bacteria not covered by the vaccine have emerged, US researchers said
yesterday, 24 Apr 2007. Since the introduction of Wyeth's wildly
successful vaccine Prevnar in 2000, doctors have been waiting and
watching for the arrival of replacement bacteria that could undo its
progress. Now they may have found them.

Researchers from the American Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) have noted an increase in the rates of bacterial
infections not covered by the current pneumococcal vaccine among
native children in Alaska.

"People are on top of it. It is not unexpected, but it is important,"
Dr. Katherine Poehling of Brenner Children's Hospital at Wake Forest
University in Winston-Salem, N.C., said in a telephone interview.

The vaccine, also called heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine,
or PCV7, is marketed as Prevnar in the USA and Canada and as Prevenar
elsewhere in the world. Given initially at ages 2, 4, and 6 months,
it protects children from bacteria that often cause ear infections
and drug-resistant pneumonia.

"Because of the surveillance, we are seeing it, and we can act in a
timely manner and maintain the benefits that we've seen," said
Poehling, who wrote a commentary on the study published in the
Journal of the American Medical Association.

The CDC's Dr. Rosalyn Singleton and colleagues studied pneumococcal
infections such as pneumonia, meningitis, or blood infections known
as bacteremia that occurred from 1995 to 2006. They found that in the
3 years after the introduction of Prevnar, from 2001 through 2003,
these diseases fell by 67 percent among native Alaskan children
younger than age 2 and 61 percent in non-native children.

Between 2001-2003 and 2004-2006, these infection rates remained
stable in non-native Alaskan children younger than 2 but jumped 82
percent among Alaska native children, who are more prone to the
infections.

Since 2004, diseases caused by strains of bacteria not covered by the
vaccine have risen by 140 percent compared with the pre-vaccine
period. During the same period, diseases caused by the
vaccine-covered strains fell by 96 percent.

[The serotypes of _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ contained in the
heptavalent conjugated polysaccharide vaccine are 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C,
19F and 23F. Conjugation of the pneumococcal polysaccharide capsular
serotypes to a protein backbone, as done in this pediatric vaccine,
produces an antigen that is T cell dependent to which young children
less than 24 months of age can respond. These antigens produce
immunologic memory so that boosting is possible with serial doses.
The current adult pneumococcal vaccine, which contains 23 different
unconjugated polysaccharide serotypes, does not produce immunologic
memory, and young children do not respond to it.

This important study in a population of Native Americans (1) has
found "serotype replacement," a changing prevalence of pneumococcal
serotypes in invasive disease including 3, 6A, 7F and especially 19A.
Not all of these are even contained in the 23-valent vaccine. Why
Alaska native children have a 2-3 times higher prevalence of
pneumococcal disease as compared to other American children is not
clear.

Although the 7-valent vaccine's efficacy is still high, as pointed
out in an accompanying editorial (2), a 13-valent conjugated vaccine
which contains serotype 19A is under development to adapt the vaccine
to this "moving target." The authors suggest that continued serotype
replacement or expansion of serotypes in the vaccine may be
periodically needed.
