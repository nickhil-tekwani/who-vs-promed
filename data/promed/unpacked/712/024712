The northern Brazilian state of Amazonas recorded a further 11 cases of rhabdomyolysis, known locally as black urine disease; not to be confused with alkaptonuria, which is given the same nickname. So far, 44 cases were confirmed over a 10-day period in 5 Amazonas cities, with the municipality of Itacoatiara seeing 34 cases and the 1st death caused by the disease.

Rhabdomyolysis is a potentially life-threatening syndrome characterized by the destruction of muscle fibers. It usually occurs in healthy people, following trauma, excessive physical activity, seizures, consumption of alcohol and other drugs, infections, and the ingestion of contaminated food.

When the syndrome appears after the consumption of fish and shellfish, it is associated with Haff disease, which is still poorly understood. In the cases registered in Amazonas state, the affected patients had reportedly consumed popular local fish such as pirarucu [arapaima], tambaqui, and pirapitinga.

Among the main symptoms of rhabdomyolysis are muscle and chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, dizziness, and weakness, as well as characteristically coffee-colored urine.

Another 6 cases of the disease were recorded last month [August 2021] in Bahia. The Northeast state suffered an outbreak of the disease last year [2021], with 40 confirmed cases.

Black urine disease: what is known about a possible outbreak in the Amazon
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Related to a toxin found in fish and shellfish, Haff's disease [black urine disease] is rare, but it has caused some outbreaks in Brazil over the past 5 years.

176 kilometers [about 109 mi] from Manaus [Amazonas state], the city of Itacoatiara has caught the attention of the health authorities of Amazonas in recent days. Since 22 Aug 2021 dozens of residents have had a condition called rhabdomyolysis, marked by the destruction of the fibers making up the body's muscles.

In the same period, individuals from 5 other municipalities in Amazonas (Silves, Manaus, Parintins, Caapiranga, and Autazes) were also diagnosed with the same condition.

All 44 cases registered so far are being investigated, but the main suspicion is these individuals have been affected by Haff's disease, popularly known as "black urine disease".

Known since the 1920s, the disease is related to a toxin found in fish and shellfish. It is precisely this substance causing damage to the muscles and can even seriously damage the kidneys.

But what explains the outbreak in Amazonas? What are the forms of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment? Know what is already known and what remains to be known about this disease.

Mystery in the Baltic
---------------------
According to an article written in 2013 (1) by specialists at Hospital Sao Lucas Copacabana, in Rio de Janeiro, the name of the disease has to do with its origin.

The 1st reports of it are from 1924 and come from the coastal region Konigsberg Haff, which is close to the Baltic Sea. Currently, this site is part of the city of Kaliningrad, which belongs to Russia and borders Lithuania and Poland.

At the time, the doctors who worked at the site described a condition of sudden onset, with "muscle rigidity, often accompanied by dark urine".

After the publication of the 1st reports, new cases were registered at the site for the next 9 years. They occurred mainly between summer and autumn and had one factor in common: fish consumption.

"Due to the absence of fever and the rapid onset of symptoms after eating cooked fish, it is believed Haff's disease is caused by a toxin," write the Brazilian authors.

Since then, new outbreaks have been registered in other countries, such as the former Soviet Union, Sweden, the United States, and China.

In Brazil, the 1st cases were identified in 2008 and 2009.

The most serious moment happened in 2017 when Bahia counted 71 patients with the disease, 66 of them in the capital Salvador.

Symptoms and diagnosis
----------------------
As it is rare and poorly studied, Haff's disease does not have a closed list of manifestations.

The main annoyances are muscle pain a few hours after eating fish or shellfish.

"Usually, we see this muscle pain concentrated in the trapezius, shoulders, and neck region," says physician Luis Filipe Miranda, from the Nephrology Service of Hospital Portugues da Bahia, in Salvador.

Some patients also experience chest pain, shortness of breath, numbness, nausea, dizziness, and weakness.

Another characteristic symptom is dark urine (hence its popular name), which resembles the color of coffee.

Muscle pain, especially in the shoulder and neck region, is usually one of the main symptoms of the disease.

It is believed the cause of the disorder is some toxin found in fish species (such as salmon, pacu, eel, and several others, both in fresh and saltwater) and crustaceans (such as lobsters, crayfish, and shrimp).

To date, scientists have not identified the toxin behind the disease. "Since the 1st cases in 1924, people have tried to find out what this substance is, but so far nothing specific has been found", emphasizes Miranda.

"It is also not known how fish acquire this toxin. Changes in the ecosystem are suspected, as well as the presence of cyanobacterial toxins or heavy metals, but so far no toxic levels of these substances have been identified," completes the nephrologist.

As far as we know, all these repercussions on the body have to do with rhabdomyolysis, a progressive destruction of the fibers making up the skeletal muscles (those responsible for our contractions and movements).

Over time, the content of these muscle cells is dumped into the blood, which often leads to a 2nd complication: kidney failure.

This is because one of the components of muscle cells is myoglobin, an enzyme which is toxic to the kidneys.

According to the article by Hospital Sao Lucas Copacabana, the diagnosis of Haff's disease can be made in the office itself, with the analysis of symptoms and confirmation the patient has eaten fish in the last 24 hours.

To be 100% sure, it is possible to have blood tests determining muscle breakdown. They measure the level of enzymes such as myoglobin and creatine phosphokinase.

Treatment and prevention
------------------------
In most cases, the condition usually progresses well, but there is a risk of death, especially in people with comorbidities.

It is recommended to seek help soon after the appearance of the 1st symptoms so the diagnosis can be made as soon as possible.

When the patient needs to stay in the hospital, one of the main forms of treatment is enhanced rehydration. A good amount of fluids allows to "dissolve" and reduce the concentration of impurities in the blood, which facilitates the work of the kidneys.

"We also suspended the use of medications which further damage the muscles and kidneys, such as statins and anti-inflammatory drugs", adds Miranda.

When the kidneys are already affected, it is often necessary to resort to hemodialysis (a procedure in which a machine filters the blood for a specific period or for the rest of that person's life).

If therapeutic resources are already scarce, the prevention of Haff disease is even more uncertain. There is nothing specific to prevent the illness.

There is no way to identify the toxin: it has no smell, taste, or color and does not disappear after cooking the meat.

"In general, the guideline is to look for a hospital when symptoms appear in the 1st 24 hours after consuming the fish or shellfish and not to use medication on your own", says Miranda.

What remains to be known about the Amazon outbreak?
---------------------------------------------------
According to the last note published on the website of the Amazonas Health Surveillance Foundation (FVS-AM), as of 30 Aug 2021, 44 cases of rhabdomyolysis had been identified (2).

The most affected city is Itacoatiara, with 34 patients and 1 death. Next, appear the municipalities of Silves (4 cases), Manaus (2), Parintins (2), Caapiranga (1), and Autazes (1).

"This Monday [30 Aug 2021], 10 people are hospitalized, all from Itacoatiara. The other patients were discharged from the hospital", informs the entity.

For now, local authorities are still investigating the problem and have not officially confirmed the outbreak is actually Haff disease, although it is the main suspicion.

This is because rhabdomyolysis can have other causes, such as trauma, strenuous physical activity, seizures, use of medications and alcohol, heavy metal intake, or consumption of foods such as fish.

In another note published on the FVS-AM website (3), experts say the population does not need to stop eating fish, as they form the basis of the Amazonian diet.

"The important thing is to understand that if we compare the level of fish consumption with the number of cases [of rhabdomyolysis], we see it is a minimal relationship, but no less worrying. Any situation that puts people's health at risk should be carefully evaluated, people should be treated in the most appropriate way possible, and we must also be concerned about the economic and nutritional aspect", advises infectologist Antonio Magela from the Tropical Medicine Foundation Dr Heitor Vieira Dourado, in Manaus.

"We are still working in the field of hypotheses. It could be a bacterium, a virus, or even a toxin. People have a clinical picture suggestive of poisoning after food intake and is rapidly evolving. To date, in all situations that this has occurred, with all the analysis of samples, tissues, it has not yet been possible to confirm the real cause of these cases of rhabdomyolysis, which are associated with previous ingestion of fish," adds the infectologist.

Since 2017, other suspected or confirmed cases of Haff disease have been reported not only in Amazonas, but also in Ceara, Alagoas, Bahia, Pernambuco, and Goias.
