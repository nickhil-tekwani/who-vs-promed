Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks (1)
Outbreak location 1: Sedgemoor, Somerset, England
Started: 1 Sep 2021
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Cattle / 300 / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0 / 0
Affected population: an isolated case of classical bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) has been confirmed in a 6.5 years old indigenous cow in a dairy farm with 172 lactating cows plus replacement heifers. All animals are homebred through AI [artificial insemination], except for 20 cows purchased 5 years ago.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: an isolated, single case of classical bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) has been confirmed in a 6.5-year-old indigenous cow on a dairy farm. The cow was in calf and close to calving, and the farmer had noticed abnormal behavior, including abnormal head carriage, knuckling of fetlocks, and aggression. The animal was humanely euthanized due to suspected (but unresponsive) milk fever [a metabolic disorder due to hypocalcemia, occurring at the time of calving, often accompanied by hypothermia] on [2 Sep 2021], and the case was disclosed during routine national statutory surveillance and testing of fallen stock cattle aged over 48 months. The animal was not presented for slaughter and did not enter the food chain. There is no threat to food safety or human health. A full epidemiological investigation is being carried out. All of the cohorts and offspring of this single BSE case have been identified and placed under movement restrictions. They will be culled and screened for BSE. The precise location of the farm has not been entered on the report to protect the farmer's well-being.

Control measures applied in domestic: official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; traceability.
Control measures to be applied in domestic: selective killing and disposal.
