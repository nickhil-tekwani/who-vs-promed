In 1944, Pennsylvania logged nearly 1000 rabies cases, with the vast majority involving dogs. Rabid dogs were a health threat all over the world.

With rabies vaccine for dogs and better efforts to control stray dogs, rabies plummeted, and for decades Pennsylvania's annual case count numbered in the low single digits. That began to change around 1980, when raccoons from the south were imported to Virginia for hunting, according to David Wolfgang, Pennsylvania's state veterinarian.

Some of those raccoons had rabies and spread it into the local raccoon population, which then spread it into Pennsylvania and additional northeastern states. Pennsylvania's rabies count rose again, and now averages about 400 per year.

The strain of rabies that affects raccoons is different than the one that can be carried by dogs. For reasons including the fact they live in dens, raccoons are prone to spreading rabies to other raccoons, Wolfgang explained. Thus, raccoons account for the majority of rabies cases in Pennsylvania.

But since any mammal can get rabies, rabid raccoons often spread it to other animals. A rabid raccoon is prone to biting "any animal that comes close to it," Wolfgang said. That results in Pennsylvania cases involving feral cats, as well as animals ranging from skunks to horses to foxes.

And a raccoon likely bit and infected the beaver that attacked a man and his daughter as they kayaked recently in the Conewago Creek in Adams County, according to Wolfgang. "It's almost always a raccoon strain," he said on [Mon 13 Aug 2018], referring to the strain he expects to turn up in the beaver. The beaver already has been confirmed to have rabies.

The last human case of rabies in Pennsylvania occurred in 1984, when a 12-year-old Williamsport boy died of rabies. He had no known contact with any animal that might have had rabies, and it remains unknown how he was exposed. Annually, an average of 1 or 2 people die of rabies in the United States, usually because they didn't know they were exposed and [don't] quickly get medical attention, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dan Wherley, the Adams County man who used his hands to fend off and eventually kill the attacking beaver, said on Facebook he's receiving a series of shots to ensure he doesn't get the disease.

Rabies require an animal host, meaning it must be spread from animal to animal, rather than an animal picking it up from a virus or bacteria in the environment.

Pennsylvania's annual counts tend to be uneven, and the regions that see the most cases tend to vary. That's because rabies tend to spread through a region's animal population, eventually denting the population and resulting in a downturn in cases, Wolfgang said.

Wolfgang noted there's a bat strain of rabies and that is cause for great concern, given how often bats enter homes and create a risk for a human to be bitten.

Another concern, he said, involves feeding of feral cats. The food attracts other animals, including raccoons, increasing the risk a cat or other animal will be bitten. Last year, 62 cats tested positive for rabies in Pennsylvania -- 18 percent of the total, and more than any animal accept raccoons.

Worldwide, about 50 000 people per year die of rabies, Wolfgang said.

In Pennsylvania, there has been discussion of using baits to vaccinate wild animals against rabies. "There is lots of discussion of how we might be able to push the epidemic back," Wolfgang said.

[Cases of rabies in unusual species, like this, originate most likely from a bite from the reservoir wildlife in the area. In eastern North America, raccoons are the reservoir species of terrestrial rabies. Raccoon rabies is caused by an antigenically distinct rabies virus variant. - Mod.PMB
