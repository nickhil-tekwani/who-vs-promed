Mongolian officials said tests have detected an H5N1 avian influenza virus in
several wild birds, confirming earlier indications that the virus had reached
the central Asian country.
One bar-headed goose and 3 whooper swans from Erhel Lake tested positive for
H5N1, a Mongolian official said in an 27 Aug 2005 report to the World
Organization for Animal Health (OIE). Hokkaido University in Japan ran the
tests, and Dooloojin Orgil, director of Mongolia's Department of Veterinary
Service, reported the results.
Mongolian officials told the OIE on 19 Aug 2005 that an H5 virus had been
found in 3 wild birds. About the same time, preliminary testing by the US
Department of Agriculture detected an H5N1 virus in 1 of about 100 birds found
dead at Erhel Lake.
The virus's appearance in Mongolia follows its emergence in parts of Siberian
Russia and Kazakhstan in recent weeks. Last spring the virus killed several
thousand birds in the Qinghai Lake wildlife refuge in north-central China,
which borders Mongolia on the south [see map at

[Mongolia's follow-up report No 2 of 27 Aug 2005 can be seen at

20No2.pdf>.
It relates to samples from Lake Erhel (Huvsgel [Hovsgol] province in northern
Mongolia) [see map at <http://media.maps.com/magellan/Images/MONGOL-W1.gif> --
near north central border with Russia. - Mod.JW] which were sent by the
Mongolian authorities on 15 Aug 2005 to the OIE Reference laboratory in the
Hokkaido University, Japan. Final results on 4 of them (samples No 1,3,4 and
6), one Bar-headed goose (_Anser indicus_) and 3 whooper swans (_Cygnus
cygnus_), were received on 24 Aug 2005 from Dr. H. Kida and Dr. Y. Sakoda at
the Japanese laboratory. The virus was identified as H5N1; the laboratory is
expected to further study the isolate, particularly comparing it with previous
isolates from the region.
This finding is in line with a report obtained on 19 Aug 2005 from the
Wildlife Conservation Society, notifying the identification of H5N1 in one
dead whooper swan collected at the same site and tested in USDA's Poultry
Research Laboratory in Athens, Georgia (see 20050819.2443). The WCS posting
also provided other important results from the same lab: 30 live whooper swans
living at the same site and also a nearby lake were negative for the virus.
Samples collected from other live birds at the 2 sites, including 60 ruddy
shelducks, 24 bar-headed geese, and 25 black-headed gulls, were found to be
negative for the virus. It has been argued that these (as well as previous
observations in China's Qinghai Lake wildlife refuge) may indicate that the
waterfowl species typically identified in recent outbreaks appear to be
victims rather than effective carriers of the disease. Further research is
urgently in need.
This event reflects an exemplary proactive, transparent attitude of the
Mongolian authorities and a commendable cooperative effort of international
experts and laboratories. Lake Erhel is just 350 km southwest of Lake Baikal
in Siberia, the largest freshwater lake in Eurasia; it will be interesting to
note if surveillance in wild birds has been undertaken there as well. - Mod.AS]
