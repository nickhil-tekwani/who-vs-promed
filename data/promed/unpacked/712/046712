Abstract
--------
Background: Long-COVID refers to a variety of symptoms affecting different organs reported by people following Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. To date, there have been no robust estimates of the incidence and co-occurrence of long-COVID features, their relationship to age, sex, or severity of infection, and the extent to which they are specific to COVID-19. The aim of this study is to address these issues.

Methods and findings: We conducted a retrospective cohort study based on linked electronic health records (EHRs) data from 81 million patients including 273 618 COVID-19 survivors. The incidence and co-occurrence within 6 months and in the 3-6 months after COVID-19 diagnosis were calculated for 9 core features of long-COVID (breathing difficulties/breathlessness, fatigue/malaise, chest/throat pain, headache, abdominal symptoms, myalgia, other pain, cognitive symptoms, and anxiety/depression). Their co-occurrence network was also analyzed. Comparison with a propensity score-matched cohort of patients diagnosed with influenza during the same time period was achieved using Kaplan-Meier analysis and the Cox proportional hazard model. The incidence of atopic dermatitis was used as a negative control.

Among COVID-19 survivors (mean [SD] age: 46.3 [19.8], 55.6% female), 57.00% had one or more long-COVID feature recorded during the whole 6-month period (i.e., including the acute phase), and 36.55% between 3 and 6 months. The incidence of each feature was abnormal breathing (18.71% in the 1- to 180-day period; 7.94% in the 90- to180-day period), fatigue/malaise (12.82%; 5.87%), chest/throat pain (12.60%; 5.71%), headache (8.67%; 4.63%), other pain (11.60%; 7.19%), abdominal symptoms (15.58%; 8.29%), myalgia (3.24%; 1.54%), cognitive symptoms (7.88%; 3.95%), and anxiety/depression (22.82%; 15.49%). All 9 features were more frequently reported after COVID-19 than after influenza (with an overall excess incidence of 16.60% and hazard ratios between 1.44 and 2.04, all p less than 0.001), co-occurred more commonly, and formed a more interconnected network. Significant differences in incidence and co-occurrence were associated with sex, age, and illness severity. Besides the limitations inherent to EHR data, limitations of this study include that (i) the findings do not generalize to patients who have had COVID-19 but were not diagnosed, or to patients who do not seek or receive medical attention when experiencing symptoms of long-COVID; (ii) the findings say nothing about the persistence of the clinical features; and (iii) the difference between cohorts might be affected by one cohort seeking or receiving more medical attention for their symptoms.

Conclusions: Long-COVID clinical features occurred and co-occurred frequently and showed some specificity to COVID-19, though they were also observed after influenza. Different long-COVID clinical profiles were observed based on demographics and illness severity.

Author summary
--------------
What did the researchers do and find?
- The research found that over 1 in 3 patients had one or more features of long-COVID recorded between 3 and 6 months after a diagnosis of COVID-19. This was significantly higher than after influenza.
- For 2 in 5 of the patients who had long-COVID features in the 3- to -6-month period, they had no record of any such feature in the previous 3 months.
- The risk of long-COVID features was higher in patients who had more severe COVID-19 illness, and slightly higher among females and young adults. White and non-white patients were equally affected.

What do these findings mean?
----------------------------
- The fact that the risk is higher after COVID-19 than after influenza suggests that their origin might, in part, directly involve infection with SARS-CoV-2 and is not just a general consequence of viral infection. This might help in developing effective treatments against long-COVID.
- The findings in the subgroups, and the fact that the majority of patients who have features of long-COVID in the 3- to -6-month period already had symptoms in the first 3 months, may help in identifying those at greatest risk.

[2] Pfizer data
Date: Tue 28 Sep 2021
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/09/pfizer-submits-data-fda-covid-vaccine-young-kids


Pfizer and BioNTech submitted initial data from a phase 2/3 trial of their mRNA COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5-11 years to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and said an application for emergency use authorization of the vaccine in that age-group will likely follow in the coming weeks (https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-submit-initial-data-us-fda-pivotal).

On 20 Sep 2021, the company shared promising results in children in that age range of 2 doses of the mRNA vaccine, which contains 10 micrograms (mcg) of active ingredient, compared with 30 mcg contained in the currently FDA-approved vaccine. Pfizer said the company will have data on vaccines in children ages 6 months to 2 years, and 2 years to 5 years, as soon as the 4th quarter of 2021.

Children under age 5 received a lower 3-mcg dose for each injection in the phase 2/3 study, the company said.

Children 11 and younger are the only group of Americans not yet eligible for COVID-19 vaccination, and pediatric cases of the virus have increased significantly since the delta (B1617.2) variant became the dominant strain in the United States this summer [2021].

For the 5th consecutive week, more than 200 000 pediatric cases were reported across the country during the week of 16-23 Sep 2021. The latest update from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) shows that nearly 207 000 child COVID-19 cases were reported last week (https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/).

"Since the pandemic began, children represented 16.0% of total cumulated cases. For the week ending 23 Sep 2021, children were 26.7% of reported weekly COVID-19 cases (children, under age 18, make up 22.2% of the US population)," the AAP said.

More New York health workers get vaccinated
-------------------------------------------
The United States reported 185 088 new COVID-19 cases yesterday [27 Sep 2021] and 2394 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases). The 7-day average of new daily cases is 117 966, with 2052 daily deaths, according to the New York Times tracker (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html).

The Times reports that thousands of healthcare workers across New York state got inoculated against COVID-19 ahead of yesterday's deadline. The statewide vaccination rate for hospital employees rose to 92% by last night, up from 84% 5 days ago.

All eyes will be on New York in the coming days, as its mandatory vaccine requirement for hospital and healthcare employees is one of the largest and strictest in the country. A similar mandate will go into effect 30 Sep 2021 in California.

But thousands of nurses, aides, and other employees in New York chose to lose their jobs rather than get vaccinated. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul yesterday [27 Sep 2021] signed an executive order that will allow healthcare workers from other states and countries to begin practicing in New York, the Washington Post reports. The governor has also said she may use the National Guard to deliver healthcare in the state (https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/09/28/new-york-vaccine-mandate-deadline/).

Delta a factor in getting vaccinated
------------------------------------
Thirty-nine percent of adults who got vaccinated since 1 Jun 2021 cite the delta variant as a major reason for doing so, followed by reports of local hospitals filling up (38%) and knowing someone who became seriously ill or died (36%), according to the latest survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) (https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/press-release/surging-delta-variant-cases-hospitalizations-and-deaths-are-biggest-drivers-of-recent-uptick-in-u-s-covid-19-vaccination-rates/).

Among the unvaccinated, 71% said the news about booster shots is a sign the vaccines aren't working. According to the KFF, "The largest remaining gap is between political partisans, with 90% of Democrats reporting they have gotten at least one dose, compared to 58% of Republicans."

Other US developments
---------------------
- An Arizona judge ruled yesterday [27 Sep 2021] that the state's law banning public schools from issuing mask mandates is unconstitutional, NPR reports. The law was set to take effect tomorrow [29 Sep 2021] (https://www.npr.org/2021/09/27/1041044436/just-before-taking-effect-arizonas-school-mask-mandate-ban-ruled-unconstitutiona).
- The nation's business economists are expecting slower growth this year [2021] due to the delta variant, CBS News reports (https://www.cbsnews.com/news/delta-variant-covid-19-economy/).
- Pfizer yesterday [27 Sep 2021] said it has started a phase 2/3 study of an oral prophylactic against COVID that consists of a low dose of the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir given with an investigational antiviral candidate (https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-starts-global-phase-23-epic-pep-study-novel-covid-19).

["A spokesman for Moderna, Ray Jordan, confirmed that the company intends to expand its trial 'to enroll a larger safety database which increases the likelihood of detecting rarer events' and expects to seek emergency authorization late this year [2021] or early next year [2022].

"The Moderna trial began recruiting patients in March [2021] with the aim of enrolling 6795 participants younger than 12. The participants were to be split equally into 3 age brackets, including a 6- to 11-year-old group, of 2265 participants each. Mr. Jordan said the company is 'actively discussing' a proposal with the FDA to expand the trial.

"Pfizer is on a faster timetable than Moderna and may be able to meet the FDA's expectations on a bigger trial size and still file a request to expand emergency authorization of its vaccine by the end of September [2021]. [It just submitted initial data from a phase 2/3 trial. - Mod.LK] Reviewing all the safety and efficacy data will likely take regulators at least a few weeks.

"Pfizer has previously said it expects to have results for the 5- to 11-year-old group in September [2021], with results for children aged 2-5 shortly after that. Results for the youngest children -- 6 months to 2 years old -- are expected in October or November [2021]. A spokeswoman said Monday (27 Sep 2021) that the company had no updates on its timetable."

"The FDA authorized the Pfizer vaccine on an emergency basis for children ages 12-15 in April [2021]; the Moderna vaccine has been cleared only for people 18 and older. The agency attached a warning about potential heart problems to the fact sheets of the vaccines in June [2021]."

"More than 4 million American children and adolescents have tested positive for the virus since the onset of the pandemic, the American Academy of Pediatrics reported last week. Of those, at least 346 have died" (https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/26/us/politics/fda-covid-vaccine-trials-children.html). - Mod.LK]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 challenges the understanding of factors affecting disease progression and severity. The identification of prognostic biomarkers and physiological processes associated with disease symptoms is relevant for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic interventions to contribute to the control of this pandemic. To address this challenge, in this study, we used a quantitative proteomics together with multiple data analysis algorithms to characterize serum protein profiles in 5 cohorts from healthy to SARS-CoV-2-infected recovered (hospital discharge), nonsevere (hospitalized), and severe [at the intensive care unit (ICU)] cases with increasing systemic inflammation in comparison with healthy individuals sampled prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The results showed significantly dysregulated proteins and associated biological processes and disorders associated to COVID-19. These results corroborated previous findings in COVID-19 studies and highlighted how the representation of dysregulated serum proteins and associated BPs increases with COVID-19 disease symptomatology from asymptomatic to severe cases. The analysis was then focused on novel disease processes and biomarkers that were correlated with disease symptomatology. To contribute to translational medicine, results corroborated the predictive value of selected immune-related biomarkers for disease recovery [Selenoprotein P (SELENOP) and Serum paraoxonase/arylesterase 1 (PON1)], severity [Carboxypeptidase B2 (CBP2)], and symptomatology [Pregnancy zone protein (PZP)] using protein-specific ELISA tests. Our results contributed to the characterization of SARS-CoV-2-host molecular interactions with potential contributions to the monitoring and control of this pandemic by using immune-related biomarkers associated with disease symptomatology.
