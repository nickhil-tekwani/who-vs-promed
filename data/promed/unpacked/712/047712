CDC is collaborating with public health and agriculture officials in multiple states and the FDA to investigate an ongoing multistate outbreak of human _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Infantis infections. Public health investigators used DNA "fingerprints" of salmonellae obtained through diagnostic testing with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE, to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak. They used data from PulseNet, the national subtyping network made up of state and local public health laboratories and federal food regulatory laboratories that performs molecular surveillance of foodborne infections. The outbreak strain is rare, and typically 0-3 isolates are reported per month.

Multiple brands of dry pet food produced by Diamond Pet Foods at a single manufacturing facility in South Carolina have been linked to some of the human salmonellosis. People who think they might have become ill after contact with dry pet food or with an animal that has eaten dry pet food should consult their health care providers.

A total of 14 individuals infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ Infantis have been reported from 9 states. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: Alabama (1), Connecticut (1), Michigan (1), Missouri (3), North Carolina (3), New Jersey (1), Ohio (2), Pennsylvania (1), and Virginia (1). Among persons for whom information is available, illnesses began between 8 Oct 2011 and 22 Apr 2012. Ill persons range in age from less than one year old to 82 years old, and the median age is 48 years. 77 percent of patients are female. Among the 9 patients with available information, 5 (56 percent) were hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------
On 2 Apr 2012, the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development detected salmonellae in an unopened bag of Diamond Naturals Lamb Meal & Rice dry dog food, which had been collected on 14 Mar 2012, during routine retail testing of dry pet food. Public health investigators used PulseNet to identify recent cases of human illness with a PFGE pattern indistinguishable from _S._ Infantis that was isolated from the unopened bag of dry dog food produced by Diamond Pet Foods. In interviews, ill persons answered questions about contact with animals and foods consumed during the week before becoming ill. Seven of 10 (70 percent) ill persons interviewed reported contact with a dog in the week before becoming ill. Of 5 ill persons who could recall the type of dog food with which they had contact, 4 (80 percent) identified dry dog food produced by Diamond Pet Foods that may have been produced at a single facility in South Carolina.

As part of this outbreak investigation, Ohio public health and agriculture officials collected and tested dry dog food produced by Diamond Pet Foods. The outbreak strain of _S._ Infantis was isolated from an opened bag of Diamond Brand Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover's Soul Adult Light Formula dry dog food collected from the home of an ill person, and an unopened bag of the product collected from a retail store. A sample of Diamond Puppy Formula dry dog food collected by FDA during an inspection at the South Carolina production facility has also yielded _Salmonella_.

Epidemiologic, laboratory, and regulatory investigations are ongoing to identify whether other brands of dry dog food produced at this facility may be linked to human illnesses. Diamond Pet Foods is cooperating with public health and agricultural investigators in this ongoing investigation.

[The following is extracted from the CDC report of human _S._ Schwarzengrund infection linked to dry dog food with the citations renumbered to start with 1 (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5744a2.htm):

Consumers and health departments should be aware that all dry pet food, pet treats (1), and pet supplements (2) might be contaminated with pathogens such as _Salmonella_, and consumers should use precautions with all brands of dry pet food, treats, and supplements. In contrast, canned pet food is unlikely to be contaminated with such pathogens because the manufacturing process should eliminate bacterial contamination. To prevent _Salmonella_ infections, persons should wash their hands for at least 20 seconds with warm water and soap immediately after handling dry pet foods, pet treats, and pet supplements, and especially before preparing and eating food for humans. Infants should be kept away from pet feeding areas. Children aged less than 5 years should not be allowed to touch or eat dry pet food, treats, or supplements.

In addition to transmission of _Salmonella_ from contact with dry pet food, humans can acquire _Salmonella_ infection from contact with the feces of animals that acquired _Salmonella_ infection from contaminated dry pet food or other sources. Effective hand washing after handling pets and animal feces will prevent such infections. Persons who suspect that contact with dry pet food or pets has caused illness should consult their health-care providers.
