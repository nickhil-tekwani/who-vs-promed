Update on Atypical Pneumonia Cases in Singapore
------------------
One new patient with SARS was admitted since the MOH Press Release
yesterday. She is a health care worker who was in contact with a case. As
at 17 Mar 2003, we have a total of 21 patients of SARS. Other than the
initial 3 cases, the additional 18 patients were all close contacts with
patients of SARS. Ten are family members and friends, and 8 are hospital
staff. All the patients are stable, except for 2 patients who are in a
serious condition.
The doctor, his wife and his mother-in-law are being treated in the
infectious disease unit of a university hospital in Frankfurt, Germany. The
conditions of the doctor and his mother-in law are stable.
The Ministry would like to reiterate that you should seek immediate medical
attention if you have:
- Fever (greater than 38 degrees Celsius) and respiratory symptoms
including cough, shortness of breath or breathing difficulty;
AND
- have travelled to Hong Kong, Hanoi or Guangdong province in China, within
2 weeks of onset of the symptoms; or
- are a close contact of persons diagnosed with SARS. (Close contact means
having cared for, having lived with, or having had direct contact with
respiratory secretions and body fluids of a person with SARS)
As a precautionary measure, the Ministry strongly advises you to avoid
travel to Hong Kong, Hanoi and Guangdong province in China for the time
being, unless absolutely necessary.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - multi-country outbreak - Update 2
-------------------------------
WHO coordinates international effort to identify and treat SARS
17 March 2003 -- WHO has today stepped up several activities aimed at
strengthening the international response to the recent emergence of Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). SARS is an infectious disease of unknown
etiology characterized by atypical pneumonia (see WHO press release of 15
Mar 2003 and additional information at <http://www.who.int>)
The disease is spread from person to person but only through close contact
with a case. To date, almost all reported cases have occurred in health
workers involved in the direct care of reported cases or in close contacts,
such as family members. There is no evidence to date that the disease
spreads though casual contact.
The WHO Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network is coordinating an
international multicenter effort to identify the causative agent. The
project unites 11 laboratories in 10 countries. Participating laboratories
have the most experience to date in diagnosis of cases, or are known for
their high-level facilities and expertise. The collaborative effort will
also improve diagnostic precision and move work forward on the development
of a diagnostic test. WHO is also working with health authorities to
identify an effective treatment for SARS.
WHO Global Outbreak Alert and Response teams in Hanoi and Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), China, where the most new cases are presently
concentrated, are assisting health authorities in outbreak management and
in the collection of epidemiological and clinical data that can improve
understanding of SARS.
Through its regional office in Manila, Philippines, WHO is establishing
logistics bases and supply chains to ensure rapid provision of protective
equipment and medicines needed for outbreak response.
Chinese authorities have now issued a summary report on an outbreak of what
may be the same or a related disease that began in Guangdong province in
southern China in November 2002 and peaked in mid-February 2003. The
Chinese report, which includes data on the diagnosis and management of more
than 300 cases, is presently undergoing analysis and is expected to further
contribute to understanding about the syndrome and possible links among the
various outbreaks. The Chinese report, which covers the largest number of
cases to date, may also boost international efforts to establish effective
treatment guidelines, should a relationship between the outbreaks be
established.
The Ministry of Health of China has requested support from an international
team. A WHO team is now being assembled.
Health authorities around the world are now alert to the risk of SARS.
Tracking of the course of the epidemic shows that surveillance systems are
sensitive, communication channels are open, and reporting is rapid.
Information on cases compiled over the past 3 weeks is expected to shed new
light on the behaviour of this disease.
The speed of international travel creates a risk of rapid spread to
additional areas. Because the clinical course and epidemiological behaviour
of this disease are poorly understood, WHO is calling upon national health
authorities to maintain close vigilance for suspected cases. There is no
current justification for any restriction in travel or trade.

Subject: suspected SARS - Germany ex Singapore via New York
---------------------
We report on a patient admitted the day before yesterday (Sat 15 Mar 2003)
to our Isolation Unit with atypical pneumonia, together with his travel
companions. The patient is a medical doctor from Singapore who treated one
of the earliest cases of SARS there between 3 and 9 Mar 2003. On 9 Mar 2003
he himself developed fever (39.4Â°C), myalgia
and bone pain but did not have cough, dyspnoea or sore throat. Despite
this, he flew to New York City to attend a medical meeting, accompanied by
his wife who is also a doctor and by his mother-in-law. In New York he
experienced a disseminated, transient rash. Because of persistent fever he
sought medical attention in New York. A chest X-ray revealed a pneumonic
infiltrate of the lingula (left lobe), and antibiotic treatment using
levofloxacin was initiated.
Because he continued to feel unwell, he decided to return to Singapore via
Frankfurt on 14 Mar 2003. During the first leg of this flight he developed
fever again with deterioration of his general condition. In addition, his
mother-in-law had developed a sore throat the day before and became febrile
on the day of departure (14 Mar 2003). In accordance with the global alert
about cases of atypical pneumonia recently issued by WHO
(<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/releases/2003/pr22/en/>), an international
health alert was declared after consultation between the Ministry of Health
of Singapore and the German Health Authorities and the plane was met at
Frankfurt airport by health officials (see also
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_03_15/en/>). The index patient, his
mother-in-law and his pregnant wife - who felt well and had no signs or
symptoms - were admitted to the Isolation Unit at Frankfurt University
Hospital under full biosafety precautions.
At admission, the index patient was still febrile up to 39.6Â°C, with
elevated CRP [C-reactive protein - used to assess an acute phase reaction
in inflammatory and infective processes with an elevated value interpreted
as an indication of an acute phase response or active disease - Mod.MPP],
leukopenia and mild elevation of transaminases and LDH. His chest X-ray
still showed an infiltrate of the lingula. Antibiotic treatment was
broadened by adding imipenem, vancomycin, doxycyclin and oseltamivir to
levofloxacin. Nevertheless, he has now developed a cough and difficulty
breathing and today transiently requires oxygen through a mask at 4 l/min.
CRP and white blood cell count increase, other laboratory markers have not
changed significantly since admission. The pulmonary infiltrates now extend
to the left and right upper lobes.
His mother-in-law is currently afebrile, but she also developed a cough;
since admission, her CRP has increased from 6.8 mg/dl to 9.9 mg/dl (normal
range, <0.5 mg/dl), and her white blood cell count decreased slightly from
10.2/nl to 8.8/nl. Her chest X-ray shows no abnormalities. Coagulation
parameters and renal function are normal in both patients. She is on
imipenem, and levofloxacin, doxycyclin and tamiflu.
Emergency microbiological tests undertaken in Frankfurt have yielded no
evidence of Legionella infection; electron microscopy of respiratory swab
samples was negative for virus particles, and testing for influenza antigen
was negative. The results of viral cultures are pending. Further tests for
influenza viruses are being performed by the Institute for Virology in
Marburg and the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin; so far, the results of
electron microscopy and PCR are negative. Further testing (serology, PCR
etc.) is under way.
Up to Sunday [16 Mar 2003], the patient's wife has remained well without
any symptoms; she is quarantined in a side room apart from her relatives.
Over the past hours, however, she, too, has developed a fever (38.2 C at 8
PM local time, later 37.6 C spontaneously). Therefore we started treatment
of the pregnant wife with erythromycin.
After thorough cleaning and disinfection, the aircraft has in the meantime
flown back to Singapore, albeit without passengers, due to demands by the
Singaporean authorities. 83 fellow passengers resident in Germany are
currently under "domestic quarantine"; they have been told to stay at home
during the incubation period of 2 to 7 days and are being looked after by
their local health authorities.

Israel: From Haaretz Daily Tues, 18 Mar 2003 00:30 (GMT+2)
<http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=273876>
A 33-year-old man suspected of being infected by a mysterious form of
pneumonia that has sparked a World Health Organization warning was admitted
to Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv on Monday after returning from Hong Kong
and complaining of cough, fever, head and muscle pain, and general flu
symptoms.
The Health Ministry emphasized there "is still no laboratory diagnosis of
the patient's symptoms and there is no evidence of pneumonia." It was
further noted the man was hospitalized due to caution and because of his
recent return from Hong Kong.

Two probable cases of SARS have been reported in Germany. Two women in
Leipzig have been admitted to a quarantine ward. The women had been in
Singapore and Vietnam for vacation and are now probably suffering from the
new form of pneumonia. They have been transferred to the isolation ward,
says the infectious diseases specialist Bernhard Ruf of the St. Georg
Hospital in Leipzig.

A British man returning from Hong Kong has been admitted to hospital with a
suspected case - the UK's first. [from another newswire there was
additional information on this case: The suspected case is a man who
travelled from Hong Kong to Manchester via Amsterdam on Saturday. He is now
being treated in isolation at the Infectious Diseases Unit at North
Manchester General Hospital.]

In Australia two women who had recently travelled to China have been
hospitalised with symptoms, French news agency AFP reported, although
doctors stressed there was no proof they were suffering from the illness.
The Perth woman - aged in her 50s - returned from Hong Kong last week and
was admitted to Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital as a precaution on Monday, a
hospital spokeswoman said. Similarly, doctors at Ballarat Base Hospital
[Victoria] are waiting on tests on a 47-year-old Ballarat woman, who
returned from a visit to China on Saturday and was admitted on Sunday night
with a flu-like illness. [From the second newswire: 47-year-old woman was
being treated at Ballarat Base Hospital, while a 44-year-old man was in a
stable condition at Royal Melbourne Hospital, making a total of 2 suspected
cases in Victoria Australia, the woman returned from China, the man from
Hong Kong. - Mod.MPP]

A man who shared a Toronto hospital room with a patient believed have
[SARS] and an Edmonton-area woman just back from Hong Kong are the latest
people believed to have fallen ill with the disease that is puzzling health
experts around the globe. That brings to 11 the number of probable and
suspected cases in Canada, public health officials said Monday. [The
article also mentions that one of the earlier reported cases from British
Columbia has been ruled out as not being SARS - Mod.MPP]

[ProMED-mail would like to thank John Herbert <j_a_herbert@yahoo.com>,
Niman, Henry L. <HNIMAN@PARTNERS.ORG>, Muruga Vadivale
<vale@pop.jaring.my>, Gerhard Mosbach
<mosbach@web.de> for contributing information on this outbreak.
In this posting we are trying to continue the format of presenting official
reports from Ministries and Departments of Health, the WHO, and physicians
involved in the care and treatment of cases. We are selecting newswire
"shorts" of information of additional suspected cases that have been
reported to the newswires but at the time of preparation of this posting
were not found on official websites. We are very much attempting to
contribute to a rapid dissemination of update information on this unfolding
outbreak without contributing to rumor-mongering.
At present there are no official reports of evidence of widespread
community transmission of SARS. The overwhelming majority of suspected
cases identified to date continue to be in individuals having a history of
close contact (either in the health care environment or among close family
or friends) of other SARS cases. One might interject here that this is one
of the prequalifiers in the case definition: "high fever (greater than 38
C) AND one or more respiratory symptoms including cough, shortness of
breath, difficulty breathing AND one or more of the following: "close
contact* with a person who has been diagnosed with SARS." But the other
qualifier is "recent history of travel to areas reporting cases of SARS"
(<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_03_15/en/>) which includes those
countries where cases have been now been confirmed (see [3] Worldwide - WHO
update above).
An etiologic agent has not been identified as yet.
We look forward to learning more about the outbreak in Guangdong China. If
the outbreak in Guangdong is identified as consistent with SARS, may well
have been the "origin" of this syndrome as that outbreak is now described
as having begun in November 2002, several months before the cases were
identified elsewhere.
For those who are more "visually" inclined, the article in the BBC newswire
report at: <http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2858439.stm> has a nice
map of the world showing the current geographic distribution of where cases
have been reported from. - Mod.MPP]
