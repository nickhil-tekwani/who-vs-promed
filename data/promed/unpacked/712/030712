I would like to point out that, contrary to the comment above, EHV-1
is classified as an OIE list B disease and several countries (e.g.
China) insist on evidence of lack of infection prior to trade being
allowed.
EHV-1 is listed under equine rhinopneumitis (the collective term for
infection by EHV-1 or EHV-4), which may explain why the author of the
comment did not 'find' equine herpesvirus 1 on the lists.

[I stand corrected. I couldnÂ´t find equine rhinopneumitis either --
the OIE website calls it equine rhinopneumONitis. Animal disease
nomenclature is obviously a minefield! - Mod.JW
