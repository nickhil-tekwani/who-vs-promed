After above postings Municipal Health Centres in the Netherlands were
informed last week to be at the alert for meningococcal disease related to
the Hadj and suggested to inform respective GP's and specialists. Up to
today two confirmed and one possible case were identified. The confirmed
cases (date of onset disease 5&6 Apr 2000, _N.
meningitidis_ Group W135 2a,P1.5) were grandchildren with intimate contact
with grandparents that returned from Mekka.
The possible case is a previously healthy man of 36 who collected his
mother (returning from Mekka) from the airport and who fell ill three days
later with high fever and who died several hours later (25 Mar 2000)
unattended by a physician. As is the custom in this population he was
buried within 24 hours and no specimens were taken for microbiological
confirmation. The national outbreak management team convened last Thursday
and today and discussed pro's and con's of large scale intervention with
either chemoprophylaxis or vaccination (or both). People returning from
Mekka and their families were informed through imams, newspapers and a
special phone number for questions was opened. The team advised that active
surveillance has to be continued but at present no other interventions have
to be taken other then the usual chemoprophylaxis of close contacts of cases.
It was decided that it would be beneficial to vaccinate the close contacts
as well. This has to await clearing and registration of a quadrivalent
meningococcal vaccine (what is not normally available in the Netherlands)
which will be arranged as soon as possible.
