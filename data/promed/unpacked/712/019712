[According to the FAO press release published on 21 Aug 2020, titled "Preparedness for the Introduction and spread of Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) in Viet Nam, available at http://www.fao.org/vietnam/news/detail-events/fr/c/1304431/: "Preliminary risk assessment results showed that the risk of LSD introduction and spread to Viet Nam is high with low to moderate uncertainty. Short spread can occur quickly and progressively from China through vectors. Longer spread could occur through cattle/buffalo informal trade (truck or foot) since China does not export to Viet Nam. If informal trade occurs with trucks, vectors can also be transported to Viet Nam. Cattle/buffalo products do not constitute a major risk as compared to live animal trade/vector.

"FAO Viet Nam has been working closely with Viet Nam Department of Animal Health (DAH) to increase awareness about the disease, assess the current situation and managing the risk of LSD introduction and spread:
- shared risk communication materials (in Vietnamese) on LSD recognition for farmers and veterinarians;
- reinforce control of animal movements and the trade of animal products (including semen);
- reinforce biosecurity measures at border control points (such as quarantine stations, animal surveillance)

At FAO Rome, an Incident Coordination Group (ICG) was activated in December 2019 covering India and Bangladesh and has been extended to all Asia." - Mod.CRD
