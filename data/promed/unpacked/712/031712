More than 4800 dairy cows at risk of carrying tuberculosis (TB) are
being slaughtered this week in central California, where nearly 16
000 cattle in the country's largest milk-producing region have been
quarantined, federal officials said.

Undersecretary of Agriculture Bruce Knight met privately with local
dairy operators Tuesday [8 Jul 2008] along with the state
veterinarian and other industry officials monitoring 3 new cases of
TB recently discovered in Fresno County dairies.

Federal and state agriculture officials were still tightlipped about
the identities and locations of the 3 dairies where cows tested
positive for the disease, which can be transmitted to humans and
other mammals through the air or through drinking unpasteurized milk
from an infected cow.

The discovery of the highly contagious respiratory disease already
has prompted changes in interstate shipping regulations.

Pasteurization kills the TB bacteria, but trade organizations still
worry about the possible financial impact on California's USD 7.3
billion dairy industry. "One of the concerns is with trade
agreements," says Ray Souza, a Turlock dairy operator and board
member of the Western United Dairymen, a trade group that represents
1100 dairies across the state. "Things like this can be used to re-negotiate."

The owner of one dairy has accepted a USDA (US Department of
Agriculture) buyout of up to USD 3000 a head, and his cows are headed
for the slaughterhouses. The 2 other dairies are weighing whether to
operate under strict quarantines, which can last for years.

One of the affected dairies milks more than 10 000 cows and sells
semen and embryos from high-production cows and bulls
internationally. The operation faces losing 50 years of genetic
development if the dairy operator chooses to slaughter his cattle,
said Michael March, chief executive of Western United Dairymen.

"It's tragic when you have that kind of investment and build up that
legacy and genetic bloodline," said Marsh. "He's facing a very
difficult choice."

A routine inspection of a slaughterhouse cow in January [2008] found
TB lesions on its lymph nodes, prompting the California Department of
Food and Agriculture's inspection so far of 150 000 cattle. 90
percent of infected cattle do not show symptoms, which include weight
loss, cough, and rough coats.

California had been free of the disease since 2005, 2 years after
cases detected in Kings and Tulare counties prompted the testing of
876 000 cattle. As a result, more than 8000 head in 2 infected herds
were slaughtered that year.

"Because we don't have a good test and it can be spread so easily,
unfortunately they are guilty until proven innocent," said Andrew
House, spokesman for US Rep. Devin Nunes, whose constituents include
dozens of dairy operators. "That's especially tough if you have a
dairy herd with 10 000 animals and only one confirmed case."

State officials are still trying to understand how the cows got
exposed. DNA testing shows that 2 of the cows that tested positive
this spring [2008] share a strain of the bacteria that originated in Mexico.

In June [2008], the state Department of Food and Agriculture issued a
warning against contact with cattle of Mexican origins, and the USDA
is drafting an order that restricts transport of California cattle
across state lines without testing by a veterinarian. "They're going
to have to go through additional testing so we can keep this from
spreading," said Jay Van Rein of the California Department of Food
and Agriculture.

The restrictions on transport make it more difficult for ranchers to
sell cattle out of state, transport them for out-of-state grazing
during California's dry season, and for breeders to haul livestock to shows.

[This disease is very slow, and tenacious. It is an excellent example
of why raw milk should not be sold. The testing for TB in cattle is
not very good and as the article points out, the animal may be
infected long before it is clinically recognized. It could pass in raw milk.

It is understandable that the dairy owners do not want to lose their
genetics. However, if they opt to remain under strict quarantine,
then it is likely California will lose its TB-free status. It is also
possible that there will be more cases found as the trace-ins and
trace-outs are performed. So it is possible the state will lose its
TB-free status regardless of what these diaries do.

The state of California worked very hard to restore their free state
status, which they gained in 2005. This slow insidious disease is
difficult to eradicate. The good news is this type of slaughter
surveillance proves that the system is working. - Mod.TG]
