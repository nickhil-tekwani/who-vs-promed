Table - list of positive commercial dairy goat and sheep farms
--------------------------------------------------------------
The table, updated at the beginning of this week, now includes 5 new
positive dairy goat farms that were added to the list on 16 Apr 2010.

The locations of these farms are follows:
Kamerik, province Utrecht [No 6 in the map -- see commentary];
Alphen, province Noord-Brabant [No 10];
Alteveer, province Groningen [No 1];
Doornspijk, province Gelderland [No 5];
Druten, province Gelderland [No 5].

[The above 4 provinces are scattered from south Netherlands (N.Brabant) to
the north-east (Groningen); see map at
<http://www.planetware.com/i/map/NL/kingdom-of-the-netherlands-map.jpg>.

Since 23 Mar 2010, 10 new infected farms have been added to the list, due
to their positive bulk milk test results. The list includes now a total of
88 commercial dairy farms, identified as "positive" or "infected". 86 of
them are dairy goat farms (out of the country's total of 360, namely 24 per
cent) and 2 are dairy sheep farms (out of 40, namely 5 per cent}. More than
a million people are known to live within the 5 km radius areas around
those farms. Each one of them has already received an official letter
explaining their risky situation and advice on steps to be taken in order
to minimise their infection risk.

It would be interesting to note if stock of the new "affected" farms,
incriminated due to positive PCR milk tests, which are now to be culled,
had been vaccinated and if abortions had been observed. - Mod.AS]
