[1] Congo DR: 6th case

One more Ebola virus case was confirmed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) outbreak, raising the total to 6, the World Health Organization (WHO) DRC office said in a [Sat 23 Oct 2021] Twitter post. The number of deaths remains at 3.

Few details were available about the latest case, but the WHO said all are from the same Butsili health area within the Beni health zone of North Kivu province. The 6 cases include 2 fatalities of people who died in community settings, which raise the risk of disease spread.

In an update today [Mon 25 Oct 2021], the WHO African Region said on Twitter that, of 544 contacts identified so far, 478 are being monitored.

The DRC is experiencing its 13th Ebola outbreak, which began earlier this month [October 2021] with the death of a young boy, whose fatal illness was confirmed, and the earlier suspicious deaths of 3 neighbors. Early sequencing testing suggests that the source of the current flare-up may be linked to the DRC's large outbreak of 2018--2020. Survivors have been known to harbor the virus in immune-protected parts of the body for a much longer time than the 6 months previously thought.

The new outbreak that started 8 Oct 2021 comes after the epidemic that began in 2018 when the disease killed more than 2200 people in the conflict-ridden region, and 5 months after the country declared it was free from the virus. Hopefully, this latest case was a contact of one of the prior cases in this latest outbreak. - Mod.LK]

The population of Beni in North Kivu, mainly contact cases, is resistant to vaccination against Ebola virus disease, the response team and urban authorities noted. In a statement made on [Fri 22 Oct 2021], the response team called on the inhabitants of Beni to be vaccinated with the new vaccine which is an expertise of the Congolese, in order to cut the chain of infection and protect themselves.

"Some may be reluctant to vaccination or to decontamination, therefore, all public health actions. Even at the investigation someone just refuses to be investigated, because they know that if they are validated, they will be referred to the Ebola Treatment Center, and if they do not agree with the treatments at the CTE, he may be reluctant and even turn to resistance, " lamented Dr. Michel Tosalisana, coordinator of the response in the Beni region.

According to him, the new vaccine "Ebanga" is a Congolese pride, because it is a vaccine set up by Dr. Muyembe and his research team of the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB).

"We have at our disposal two options and the choice is established by the clinician, according to the patient's condition. We already have both options, it depends on the clinician's choice to determine which option should be administered to which patient, " continued Dr. Michel Tosalisana.

[This is a difficult translation to understand, but it is clear there is resistance to vaccination. A new vaccine has been developed at INBR, "Ebanga", which perhaps may generate more acceptance since it is locally made. - Mod.LK
