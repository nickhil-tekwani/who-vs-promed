Dr Luce provides an accurate and brief description of EHV1 and EHV4
nomenclature and some preferred common names for the diseases these 2
viruses cause. The fact that both viruses cause acute and recurrent
respiratory disease that is commonly referred to as rhinopneumonitis means
that, without laboratory confirmation, terminology for the viruses may
continue to be ambiguous.
In the last sentence of his posting Dr Luce states "Importantly,
vaccination does not offer protection against neurological manifestations
of disease." It may be more correct to say that we do not know whether
vaccination may have a protective role in preventing EHV1 myeloencephalitis.
As in the case of abortion, EHV1 vaccination may not be expected to provide
100 percent protection against EHV1 myeloencephalitis. An earlier posting
(Archive Number 20031110.2785) and a published paper (1) described a major
outbreak of EHV1 myeloencephalitis in which it was shown that in a group of
10 mares, 5 mares that did not develop myeloencephalitis were EHV1
antibody-positive, while of the 5 mares that did develop myeloencephalitis,
3 that were tested were either EHV1 antibody negative or had a rising EHV1
antibody titre.
The results of this study provide the first clue that specific EHV1
antibody negativity is a major risk factor in the development of
myeloencephalitis and that -- accordingly, by analogy with a reduced
incidence of abortion -- vaccination could reduce the incidence of
myeloencephalitis in horses at risk.

2nd Horse Has Equine Herpes Virus
-------------------------------------
A second horse at Northville Downs in Michigan has tested positive for the
equine herpes virus 1 (EHV-1).
The Michigan Department of Agriculture erected a quarantine barn at
Northville Downs after a test from 8 Dec 2004 confirmed one horse had
contracted the virus.
The 1st horse to test positive was Speedy Tino, a 6-year-old gelding son of
Survivor Gold that had been claimed from Hippodrome Trois Rivieres by
American interests. The horse has since been humanely destroyed.
Animal health surveillance detected a 2nd horse that was under quarantine,
showing symptoms of the virus and tests performed on 20 Dec 2004 confirmed
the horse had contracted EHV-1.
The equine herpesvirus can cause respiratory infection, abortion or
neurological disease in horses, and can be fatal. Although humans and other
animals are not at risk of contracting the virus, it is very contagious
amongst horses.
Other indications that a horse may have contracted the virus include fever,
cough, runny nose or neurological signs, and symptoms generally appear
within 21 days of exposure.
Horse owners with questions are encouraged to contact the Michigan
Department of Agriculture state veterinarian office at (517) 373-1077 or
the Office of Racing Commissioner at (734) 462-2400.
