Latest report confirms 11 CEM-infected stallions
------------------------------------------------
A report this week to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)
by United States authorities confirms that 11 stallions have tested
positive for contagious equine metritis [CEM].

The [2 Feb 2009] report from Dr John Clifford, deputy administrator
with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service [APHIS] of the US
Department of Agriculture [USDA] said 4 stallions are on the index
premises in Kentucky, 3 are in Indiana, 3 in Wisconsin, and 1 is in Texas.

"All _Taylorella equigenitalis_-positive horses, and all exposed
horses that have been located, are currently under quarantine or hold
order," he said.

"Testing and/or treatment protocols are being put into action for all
located horses. All testing and treatment protocols are in accordance
with federal, international, and expert guidance and requirements."

The US Department of Agriculture has reported that 45 states are
involved in containment efforts, which involve quarantining and
testing horses potentially exposed to the venereal disease.
