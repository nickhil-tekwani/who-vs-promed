An outbreak of encephalitis in southwest Nepal has claimed at least 20
lives in the past week with more than 60 new cases reported at the weekend.
The government has now rushed medicines and special teams to southwest
Nepal to deal with the outbreak.
The virus is normally carried by mosquitoes, which flourish as annual
monsoon rains sweep the area in August-September.
An outbreak of the disease across the border in northern India [Uttar
Pradesh] has killed at least 99 children, with another 140 undergoing
treatment.
