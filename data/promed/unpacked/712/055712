Citrus psorosis virus Bark Scaling on Tarocco Sweet Orange.
M. Tessitori, R. La Rosa, and A. Catara, DISTEF, Plant Pathology,
University of Catania, Catania, Italy. Plant Dis. 86:560, 2002;
published on-line as D-2002-0227-01N, 2002. Accepted for publication
22 Jan 2002.
Vein flecking [and psorosis bark scaling] of citrus leaves in Italy
have been reported only on Navelina sweet orange (_Citrus sinensis_
L.), and Thompson and Washington navel oranges (1) [but not] ... on
any local sweet orange cultivars. Among these is Tarocco, a sweet
orange cultivar that originated in Sicily, is very common because of
the high fruit quality, has an attractive fruit appearance, and has
blood-red pigmented flesh.
In April 2001, classic psorosis bark scaling symptoms were observed
on the main limbs of 10-year-old Tarocco trees grafted on sour orange
rootstock, originally obtained by topworking Clementine (_C.
reticulata_ [cv.] Blanco) trees with scions collected from
19-year-old Tarocco trees with no bark scaling at that time. The
symptomatic trees first displayed one or 2 isolated circular patches
of scales with gumming on the main or secondary limbs.
The number of patches increased and coalesced to form bigger scales,
resulting in bark flaking. Approximately 15 percent of trees in the
field showed different stages of the disease. All ... affected trees
showed vein flecking of young leaves. A leaf pattern was also present
in a few plants without bark symptoms. Bark symptoms were correlated
with the presence of Citrus psorosis virus (CPsV).
[110] samples ... representing 10 percent of the total number of
trees ... in the area of Catania, Sicily were collected during the
spring flush using a W-pattern sampling method and tested by ...
(DAS-ELISA) ([MAb] PS29) (2). Of trees tested, 14 percent showed bark
scaling, and 86 percent were symptomless. All symptomatic plants were
tested and 70 percent of symptomless trees were positive based on
DAS-ELISA.
To confirm DAS-ELISA results, 10 field samples were also tested by
bioassay on indicator plants (Navelina sweet orange ISA 315 and
Pineapple sweet orange), ... [by] (TAS-ELISA), and ... [ISEM] with a
different antiserum (MAb 13C5). DAS-ELISA-positive samples produced
vein flecking on indicator plants, were positive based on TAS-ELISA,
and contained typical CPsV particles based on ISEM (R. G. Milne, IFA,
CNR, Turin).
To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of psorosis bark
scaling reaction of Tarocco sweet orange due to CPsV infection.

[According to scientists at the University of Florida, psorosis is a
complex of virus diseases that is distributed worldwide, affecting
most citrus cultivars. Citrus psorosis virus is a species in the
genus Ophiovirus. Several viruses (psorosis A, psorosis B, blind
pocket, and concave gum) are known in Florida. There is some evidence
that psorosis B strain may be identical to some strains of citrus
ringspot virus. Natural spread occurs by unknown means in Argentina,
Texas, and, in one case, in Florida. Tree decline from natural
psorosis infections is currently a major problem in Argentina and is
regarded as a potential threat in Florida and Texas. Bark scaling
usually develops several years after the appearance of leaf symptoms.
Most cultivars develop leaf symptoms, but bark scaling and tree
decline occur primarily on sweet orange, grapefruit, and some
mandarins. All strains of psorosis are transmitted by infected
budwood. No vectors are known but they are suspected in some
locations.
