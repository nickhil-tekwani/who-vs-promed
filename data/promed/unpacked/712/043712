https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/influenza/influenza-updates/2022/2022_12_26_surveillance_update_435.pdf?sfvrsn=549d2de_1&download=true


Influenza update no. 435 (based on data up to 11 Dec 2022)
-------------------------------------------------------
In this update, in addition to the influenza surveillance information, that of the SARS-CoV-2 surveillance by the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) through its associated sentinel and non-sentinel surveillance systems and reported to FluNet is included. Information on the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is included where available.

Summary
-------
- Countries are recommended to monitor the co-circulation of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. They are encouraged to enhance integrated surveillance, and in northern hemisphere countries step-up their influenza vaccination campaign to prevent severe disease and hospitalizations associated with influenza. Clinicians should consider influenza in differential diagnosis, especially for high-risk groups for influenza, and test and treat according to national guidance. Because of changes in surveillance of respiratory viruses during the COVID-19 pandemic, comparisons of current data with that from previous seasons may not always be valid and data should be interpreted with caution.
- Globally, influenza activity remained elevated due to activity in the northern hemisphere. Where subtyped, influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominated.
- In the countries of North America, some indicators of influenza activity decreased while others were stable or continued to increase. Many indicators were above levels typically observed at this time of year and some were near or above levels observed at the peak of previous epidemics. Influenza A(H3N2) was the predominant virus detected.
- In Europe, overall influenza activity continued to increase with influenza positivity from sentinel sites remaining above the epidemic threshold at the regional level. Influenza A viruses predominated with A(H3N2) viruses accounting for the majority of subtyped influenza A viruses from sentinel sites and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses predominant among non- sentinel samples in recent weeks.
- In central Asia, influenza activity increased with relatively equal proportions of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B viruses reported. Influenza B viruses predominated in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan while influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 predominated in Kyrgyzstan and
Tajikistan.
- In Northern Africa, influenza detections increased but remained low. Morocco reported mainly B/Victoria lineage virus detections. Tunisia reported increasing detections of mainly influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 as well as some influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B/Victoria lineage
virus detections.
- In Western Asia, influenza activity decreased overall with all seasonal influenza subtypes detected in similar proportions, though increased activity was reported in some countries.
- In East Asia, influenza activity of predominantly influenza A(H3N2) remained low overall among reporting countries but with some increases reported in southern China and the Republic of Korea.
- In the Caribbean and Central American countries, influenza activity of predominantly influenza A(H3N2) viruses decreased but remained elevated in Mexico.
- In the tropical countries of South America, influenza detections were low, and A(H3N2) viruses predominated.
- In tropical Africa, influenza activity remained low with detections of all seasonal influenza subtypes reported. An increased number of detections was reported from Eastern Africa.
- In Southern Asia, influenza activity continued to decrease to low levels, mainly due to decreased activity reported in Iran (Islamic Republic of). Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was the most frequently detected subtype in the subregion.
- In South East Asia, detections of predominantly influenza B increased and remained elevated.
- In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity decreased in Argentina and Chile and remained low elsewhere.

[As recommended in the above update the countries should monitor for co-circulation of Influenza and SARS-CoV2 during this season, using an integrated approach for surveillance of these respiratory pathogens, especially in at-risk population groups. The at-risk group which does not have a similar vulnerability to both pathogens are children who are more susceptible to influenza infections than COVID-19. - Mod.UBA]

The Biden administration said on [Wed 21 Dec 2022] that it will release doses of prescription flu medicine from the Strategic National Stockpile to states as flu-sickened patients continue to flock to hospitals and doctors' offices around the country.

This year's flu season has hit hard and early. Some people are even noticing bare shelves at pharmacies and grocery stores when they make a run for over-the-counter medicines as cases have spiked. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that the flu has resulted in 150 000 hospitalizations and 9300 deaths so far this season.

"Jurisdictions will be able to get the support they need to keep Americans healthy as flu cases rise this winter," Dawn O'Connell, an assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Health and Human Services Department, which oversees CDC, said in a statement. States will be able to request doses of the prescription flu medication Tamiflu (oseltamivir) kept in the Strategic National Stockpile from HHS. The administration is not releasing how many doses will be made available. Last week [w/e 18 Dec 2022], HHS also announced it would allow states to dip into statewide stockpiles for Tamiflu, making millions of treatment courses available. Tamiflu can be prescribed to treat flu in people over the age of 2 weeks old.

This flu season is coming on the heels of a nasty spike of respiratory syncytial virus cases in children and just as COVID-19 cases are climbing -- again. Spot shortages of over-the-counter pain relievers and medicines have been reported at stores around the country, particularly for children. CVS Health, for example, has placed a 2-product limit on all children's pain relief products bought through its pharmacies or online. Walgreens is limiting customers online to 6 purchases of children's over-the-counter fever-reducing products.

The Food and Drug Administration has not reported a shortage of Tamiflu. However, the federal agency says the prescription antibiotic amoxicillin is in short supply due to increased demand [although, of course, antibiotics are ineffective against viral infections. - Mod.SH].

The flu is spreading at a high rate in Washington state with deaths at higher rates than are usually seen at this point in the season, according to health officials. The Washington Department of Health said on [Tue 20 Dec 2022] that 40 people have died from the flu in Washington including 3 children, as of [10 Dec 2022].

"We urge everyone aged 6 months and older to get vaccinated as soon as possible," said Umair A Shah, secretary of health. "Getting your flu shot now helps to protect us all, especially as we plan to gather for holidays and events." The vaccines can help prevent severe illness, disease spread, and hospitalizations in an already strained healthcare system, officials said.

The commonest strain of flu seen so far this year is influenza A (H3N2), which typically causes more severe disease. The flu vaccines provide protection against that strain, officials said. The flu vaccine is available at most pharmacies, health care provider offices, and clinics, and can be received at the same time as any other vaccine, officials said.

In addition to the flu, other respiratory illnesses such as COVID-19 and RSV are also making children and adults sick and overloading hospitals in the state. Officials are also recommending that people get COVID-19 vaccines and boosters and consider wearing a mask in crowded indoor places.

https://www.thenational.scot/news/23206664.flu-cases-highest-level-scotland-five-years/


Public Health Scotland (PHS) has now raised the incidence of influenza from "high" to "extraordinary" activity level. Nick Phin, director of public health science at PHS, said: "At this point, we don't know whether we've reached the peak or if it will continue, or we'll start to see it dip down." The latest weekly figures from PHS show there were 1358 influenza cases in Scotland in the week ending [18 Dec 2022].

The hospitalisation rate for influenza has been generally increasing since the middle of the year, PHS added, with this now reaching 7.5 patients per 100 000. The rate is highest for infants aged under one, at 32.9 per 100,000. PHS added that the number of patients in the hospital who have tested positive for influenza so far this season is higher than it has been since 2017.

Phin said: "The figures that we are publishing today show that flu detections, positive tests, are at a level probably last seen in the 2017-18 season. This is the highest they've been since that particular time, it's a fairly sharp increase. The figures are the highest in the last 5 years, the number of notifications we currently usually get precedes an increase in activity in hospitals probably by a week to 10 days, so we expect to see the current activity in the hospital to continue at least for the forthcoming week or so.

"There are things that we can do - people should be offered the vaccination. The 2nd thing is we have antivirals and these are available on prescription to certain groups should they develop a flu-like illness. We know if given early these can have an impact to reduce the severity of illness some people may get." He said the upcoming school Christmas break could slow the spread of the virus, as "children tend to be fairly active spreaders of flu amongst themselves and the community".

An estimated 2 475 611 Scots have been vaccinated against flu so far this year [2022], including 1 902 233 adults - of whom 959 719 are aged 65 and over. Vaccination, together with the use of anti-virals when people have symptoms, can reduce the severity of illness, Phin said.

PHS also found there has been no increase in cases of Group A Strep infections, with the number said to have leveled off. Cases of this could now decrease next week, PHS added. While there has been an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases being detected, PHS stressed this will not necessarily lead to a rise in hospitalisations or death - with vaccines and natural immunity meaning experts do not expect the same level of people requiring hospital treatment that there was earlier in the pandemic.

More than 100 000 cases of influenza-like illness have been recorded nationwide, according to the Department of Health (DoH). The latest Disease Surveillance Report of the DoH showed that there were 114 278 flu-like cases from [1 Jan to 3 Dec 2022]. The number of cases is 45% higher than the 78 550 cases reported during the same period last year [2021].

Davao recorded the highest number of cases with 23 177, followed by Northern Mindanao with 17 283 and Central Visayas, 12 151. The regions that recorded the highest increase in cases are the National Capital Region with 589% or from 602 to 4145 cases; Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, 356% or from 540 to 2460 cases and Soccsksargen, 139% or from 2 869 to 6 844 cases.

Data from the DoH's Epidemiology Bureau showed that deaths caused by influenza-like illness reached 446 or a case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.4%. Last year [2021], 955 deaths were recorded, a CFR of 1.2%. The regions with the most deaths are Davao with 162; Central Visayas (127), and Caraga (38).

The DoH had earlier warned the public of illnesses such as influenza, which is common during the holiday season. "We have a trend of illnesses or a season of illness. We experience this whenever the weather changes in the Philippines, like dry then it becomes rainy or hot then cold like this month of December," DoH officer-in-charge Maria Rosario Vergeire said. She said cases of influenza, pneumonia, and "worsened flu" usually increase this time of the year.

Influenza-like illness is a medical diagnosis of possible influenza or other illness causing a set of common symptoms. The symptoms include fever, chills, dry cough, loss of appetite, body aches, nausea, and sneezing.

[All the above reports indicate at least 2 things with clarity; the influenza activity has surged earlier this year than expected (generally cases increase and the seasonal peak is seen in mid to end of January) and an increased number of influenza cases have been reported with Influenza A/H3N2 as the predominant subtype.

What remains to be seen is whether this surge will continue to go up, possibly compounded by the increased number of COVID-19 cases or whether there will be follow-up peaks in the coming weeks.

As recommended by WHO, it would be prudent not to compare this season's activity with the last few years, as the pandemic had a substantial effect on respiratory virus surveillance. However, it is best to move away from pathogen-specific surveillance to an integrated approach for the detection of respiratory viruses and develop public health and resource plans accordingly. - Mod.UBA
