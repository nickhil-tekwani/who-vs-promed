FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE IN IRELAND - Additional information
See also: 23 March 2001
-----------------------------
Text of a fax received on 3 Apr 2001 from Dr Michael Colm Gaynor, Chief
Veterinary Officer, Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development,
Dublin:
Report date: 1 Apr 2001.
On 22 Mar 2001, the first outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) for 60
years was reported in Ireland (see Disease Information, 14 [12, 66, dated
23 Mar 2001). Additional information on the outbreak is given below. So
far, there have been no further outbreaks of FMD.
Location of the outbreak: Broughattin, Proleek, County Louth.
Total number of animals in the outbreak:
species / susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed* / slaughtered
ovi / 447 / 8 ** / 0 / 447 / 0
bov / 113 / 0 / 0 / 113 / 0
* culling was on 20 March for the affected batch and on 22 March for
remaining animals.
** 8 ewes of a batch of 97 ewes with 98 lambs.
Diagnosis: on 20 Mar 2001, 8 ewes were found to present ulceration of the
dental pad, hard palate and the inside of the lip; 5 of these ewes were
also lame. The lesions were thought to be 3-5 days old.
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was confirmed: Institute for Animal Health,
Pirbright, United Kingdom (on 22 Mar 2001).
B. Diagnostic tests used: antigen capture ELISA(1) and tissue culture.
C. Causal agent: FMD virus type O.
Epidemiology:
Following confirmation of FMD in a sheep flock in the United
Kingdom/Northern Ireland(2), 2 km from the border with Ireland, a part of
County Louth, Ireland, was declared a control zone on 1 Mar 2001. The
suspicion of FMD in Ireland was first notified on 20 Mar, during a routine
veterinary inspection of flocks within the 10-km surveillance zone of the
outbreak in the United Kingdom / Northern Ireland. Extensive investigations
have taken place into the possible source of the outbreak in County Louth.
There had been no animal movements within the previous month. The tracing
of people and vehicles is ongoing and 2 potential human contacts are being
investigated.
- The possibility of wind-borne infection from the outbreak in the United
Kingdom / Northern Ireland, 9 km away, cannot be ruled out but is unlikely.
- Based on serological evidence, the estimated date of introduction is
between 25 February and 1 March.
Control measures:
a) Movement controls:
A nationwide ban on animal markets had been imposed on 23 Feb, after the
confirmation of FMD in the United Kingdom. A nation-wide ban on all animal
movements had been imposed on 28 Feb, with movements direct to slaughter
allowed under permit from 6 Mar.
When the outbreak of FMD was confirmed in the United Kingdom / Northern
Ireland, close to the border with Ireland, a protection and surveillance
zone was established on 1 Mar along the border with the United Kingdom /
Northern Ireland adjacent to the outbreak, in compliance with European
Union Council Directive 85/511.
The outbreak in Ireland was thus confirmed within the zone in which
movement controls were already in place on animals, animal carcasses, and
other animal products. The zone was extended southwards following the
confirmation of outbreak.
b) Cull of susceptible animals:
- The infected holding was slaughtered out, and the carcasses buried in situ.
- A preemptive cull of all susceptible species within 1 km of the infected
premises took place.
- In addition, the culling of all sheep(3) within 3 km of the infected
place took place immediately thereafter.
- Further culling of sheep(3) and wildlife in areas considered to be at
risk has also taken place and has now been extended as a precautionary
measure to the whole of the peninsular area in which the outbreak took place.
Up to 1 Apr, 26 801 sheep, 600 cattle, 123 goats, 55 pigs, and 15 deer have
been killed in the protection, surveillance, and cull zones in County Louth.
Surveillance:
Serological surveillance is being carried out in contact sheep flocks and
contiguous flocks to the confirmed infected premises, and in sheep flocks
that may have received sheep imported from other countries currently
infected with FMD. Serological surveillance is also being carried out in
cattle, deer, and other susceptible species.
To date, 101 reports of suspicion of FMD have been investigated. In 24 of
these, FMD could not be ruled out, and tissue and blood samples were sent
for testing to Pirbright Laboratory. Aside from the one case itself, none
have been positive.
(1) ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
(2) See Disease Information, 14 (10), 42, dated 9 Mar 2001.
(3) The cull has concentrated on sheep due to the experience of the
behaviour of the FMD virus strain of type O currently circulating in
Europe. This strain has a low morbidity within sheep flocks, and clinical
signs are difficult to detect.
