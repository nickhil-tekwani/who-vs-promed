Health authorities battle malaria outbreak in North Cotabato
------------------------------------------------------------
At least 43 cases of malaria have been monitored in North Cotabato
[Mindanao] since January 2010, prompting officials to adopt measures aimed
at fighting the spread of the mosquitoborne disease. In a report released
last Wednesday [21 Apr 2010], the Integrated Provincial Health Office said
cases of malaria were recorded in the towns of Tulunan, President Roxas,
Carmen, Banisilan, and in Kabacan. Tulunan town registered the most cases
with 30 individuals acquiring the potentially fatal but preventable illness.

Rogelio Gante, head of the village of Bacung, said that children and the
elderly were the most affected by malaria. He said most of the patients
have since recovered though.

Dr Sherlito Pineda, medical officer of the Father Tulio Favali Hospital in
Tulunan, said the health office has already oriented local health workers
on conduct of residual spraying to kill mosquitoes. Mosquito nets have also
been distributed to the villages. "The conduct of residual spraying and
distribution of mosquito nets in affected villages could help reduce the
prevalence of the disease," he said. But Gante admitted that more needs to
be done to minimize, if not totally put under control, the disease. He said
the cooperation of villagers was needed.

Because of this, village officials have been actively campaigning and
asking villagers to maintain good hygiene in their surroundings and in
their respective homes, Gante said.

[Malaria is endemic in Mindanao. Falciparum malaria accounts for 70 per
cent of all malaria cases in the Philippines and vivax malaria for the
remaining 30 per cent. In 2003, the country reported 47 677 confirmed
cases, giving an incidence of 0.55/1000 population. The main disease foci
are in remote rural areas of 25 endemic provinces (out of a total of 65
provinces).

In August 2002, the Philippines' New National Drug Policy was signed,
designating chloroquine plus sulfadoxinepyrimethamine combination therapy
as the 1st-line drug, artemether-lumefantrine(CoartemTM) as the 2nd-line
treatment, and quinine plus antibiotic (tetracycline, clindamycin, or
doxycycline) as the treatment regimen for severe malaria (see Review of the
malaria drug efficacy situation. WHO Western Pacific Region
<http://www.wpro.who.int/internet/resources.ashx/MVP/Review+of+the+Malaria+Drug+Efficacy.pdf>).
