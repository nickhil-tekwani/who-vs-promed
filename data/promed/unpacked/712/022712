[1] WHO guidance on masks
Date: Sun 3 May 2009
Source: World Health Organization (WHO), EPR, Guidance Documents [edited]
<http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/swineflu/masks_community/en/index.html>


This document provides interim guidance on the use of masks in
communities that have reported community-level outbreaks caused by
the new influenza A(H1N1) virus. It will be revised as more data
become available.

Background:
At present, evidence suggests that the main route of human-to-human
transmission of the new influenza A (H1N1) virus is via respiratory
droplets, which are expelled by speaking, sneezing or coughing. Any
person who is in close contact (approximately one metre) with someone
who has influenza-like symptoms (fever, sneezing, coughing, running
nose, chills, muscle ache etc.) is at risk of being exposed to
potentially infective respiratory droplets.

In health-care settings, studies evaluating measures to reduce the
spread of respiratory viruses suggest that the use of masks could
reduce the transmission of influenza (2). Advice on the use of masks
in health-care settings is accompanied by information on additional
measures that may have impact on their effectiveness, such as
training on correct use, regular supplies and proper disposal
facilities. In the community, however, the benefits of wearing masks
has not been established, especially in open areas as opposed to
enclosed spaces while in close contact with a person with
influenza-like symptoms. Nonetheless, many individuals may wish to
wear masks in the home or community setting, particularly if they are
in close contact with a person with influenza-like symptoms, for
example while providing care to family members. Furthermore, using a
mask can enable an individual with influenza-like symptoms to cover
their mouth and nose to help contain respiratory droplets, a measure
that is part of cough etiquette. Using a mask incorrectly however,
may actually increase the risk of transmission rather than reduce it.
If masks are to be used, this measure should be combined with other
general measures to help prevent the human-to-human transmission of
influenza, training on the correct use of masks and consideration of
cultural and personal values.

General advice:
It is important to remember that in the community setting, the
following general measures may be more important than wearing a mask
in preventing the spread of influenza.

For individuals who are well:
- Maintain distance of at least one metre from any individual with
influenza-like symptoms, and:
- refrain from touching mouth and nose;
- perform hand hygiene frequently by washing with soap and water or
using an alcohol based hand rub (3), especially if touching the mouth
and nose and surfaces that are potentially contaminated;
- reduce as much as possible the time spent in close contact with
people who might be ill;
- reduce as much as possible the time spent in crowded settings;
- improve airflow in your living space by opening windows as much as possible.

For individuals with influenza-like symptoms:
- stay at home if you feel unwell and follow the local public health
recommendations;
- keep distance from well individuals as much as possible (at least one metre);
- cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing with tissues or
other suitable materials to contain respiratory secretions. Dispose
of the material immediately after use or wash it. Clean hands
immediately after contact with respiratory secretions!
- improve airflow in your living space by opening windows as much as possible.

If masks are worn, proper use and disposal is essential to ensure
they are potentially effective and to avoid any increase in risk of
transmission associated with the incorrect use of masks.

The following information on correct use of masks derives from the
practices in health-care settings (4):
- place mask carefully to cover mouth and nose, and tie securely to
minimize any gaps between the face and the mask;
- while in use, avoid touching the mask;
- whenever you touch a used mask, for example when removing or
washing, clean hands by washing with soap and water or using an
alcohol-based hand rub;
- replace masks with a new clean, dry mask as soon as they become damp/humid;
- do not re-use single-use masks;
- discard single-use masks after each use, and dispose of them
immediately upon removing.

Although some alternative barriers to standard medical masks are
frequently used (e.g. cloth mask, scarf, paper masks, rags tied over
the nose and mouth), there is insufficient information available on
their effectiveness. If such alternative barriers are used, they
should only be used once or, in the case of cloth masks, should be
cleaned thoroughly between each use (i.e. wash with normal household
detergent at normal temperature). They should be removed immediately
after caring for the ill. Hands should be washed immediately after
removal of the mask.

Notes:
(1) The term "mask" is used here to include homemade or improvised
masks, dust masks and surgical masks (sometimes called medical
masks). Masks have several designs. They are often single use and
labeled as either surgical, dental, medical procedure, isolation,
dust or laser masks. Masks frequently used outside health-care
settings may also be made out of cloth or paper or similar materials.
Masks, names and standards differ among countries.

interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses: systematic
review. BMJ 2008; 336;77-80.

(3) In settings where alcohol-based hand rubs are available and the
safety concerns (such as fire hazards and accidental ingestion) are
adequately addressed, their proper use (rubbing hands for 20-30
seconds) could be promoted as a means of disinfection.

[2] Distribution of reagents and antivirals (USA)
Date: Thu 30 Apr 2009
Source: Medscape Infectious Diseases [edited]
<http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/702187>


The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is taking
ongoing steps against the influenza H1N1 virus, including deploying
the strategic national stockpile of antiviral drugs and making H1N1
testing kits available in all 50 states.

"We have completed deployment of antiviral stockpiles and other
materials for use in hospitals to 9 states," Richard Besser, MD,
acting director of the CDC, told reporters at a media briefing today
[30 Apr 2009]. "Materials are moving to the rest of the states, and
all of this should be completed by 3 May 2009," he said. "We are
deploying these supplies as a forward-leaning move in the event that
this becomes something much bigger than it already is," Dr. Besser said.

In addition, a total of 34 CDC staff have been sent out to 5
locations, including 11 people who have been sent to Mexico. A lab
has been set up in Mexico to conduct testing that will help confirm
cases of the virus.

To date, the CDC reports 109 confirmed cases of H1N1 influenza in the
United States in 11 affected states. The median age of infected
individuals is 16 years, with a range of 22 months to 81 years. A
total of 6 cases have been hospitalized, and there has been one
death, in Texas. "As we see more people infected, we will see a broad
spectrum of presentations, and I do expect that there will be more
deaths," Dr. Besser said. "We continue to be very aggressive in our
approach and will continue to do that until the situation tells us
that we no longer need to do so."

Until this week, testing for H1N1 could be done only at CDC.
Currently, New York and California have the ability to test for H1N1,
but reagent kits will go out to all states tomorrow, Dr. Besser said.

Plans to create a vaccine that will be effective against the strain
are underway. Currently, a seed strain is being grown so that it can
be distributed to manufacturers. The CDC is discussing a plan to
complete the production of next year's [2010] seasonal influenza
vaccine, and then they would switch over to manufacturing the H1N1
vaccine. "We still want to protect the country from seasonal flu and
to be able to protect from this new virus if we decide to do so," Dr.
Besser said. "Our hope is that we are able to see the transmission
now go away, with the efforts that are underway and what we know
about flu virus transmission, and be ready in the fall [2009] to
vaccinate people if we decide that is what is warranted," he added.
"That is the plan, to work towards developing a vaccine [to be ready]
in the fall."

Arnold S. Monto, MD, an influenza expert and professor of
epidemiology at the University of Michigan School of Public Health,
Ann Arbor, suggests that as with seasonal flu, all severe cases of
H1N1 influenza should be treated with antiviral drugs. "The problem
here is that we have issues of availability of the antivirals if we
have a large pandemic and/or a severe pandemic. The stockpiles will
only go so far. So all of us are going to have to pay attention to
national recommendations for antiviral use as they are developed.
More information on all of this will become available shortly.
According to Dr. Monto, antiviral drug manufacturers are increasing
production, but it may not be enough to meet excessive demand, so "we
must pay attention to which patients are experiencing the most severe
outcomes, and this may be different from seasonal flu, which mainly
affects the elderly."

[3] H1N1 in the UK
Date: Mon 4 May 2009
Source: BBC News [edited]
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8032697.stm>


A 3rd UK school has shut after a girl aged 14 was diagnosed with
swine flu. The pupil at South Hampstead High School in London is the
3rd British person to contract the virus without 1st traveling to
Mexico or the US. An 11-year-old girl from southwest London and a man
from Ayrshire have also contracted swine flu, bringing the number of
UK confirmed cases to 18.

Environment Secretary Hilary Benn said the outbreak was less severe
than 1st thought, but people should "play safe." Classrooms at South
Hampstead High School, attended by the child from Barnet who is in
year 9, have been closed until at least Thursday [7 May 2009].
Antiviral drugs have been offered to her year group, and special
arrangements were being made for upcoming exams. In a letter posted
to parents on its website, the independent school said the girl was
"at home and well." South Hampstead is the 3rd UK school to close
since the outbreak, following Downend School in South Gloucestershire
and Paignton Community and Sports College in Devon.

However, the Health Protection Agency (HPA) said the school attended
by the 11-year-old will remain open, as the child "did not attend
school while symptomatic." The Department of Health (DoH) said the
child had recently returned from the US. Several Britons are still
under quarantine in a Hong Kong hotel after a guest there became
China's 1st confirmed case of swine flu. Eddie Sweeney and his wife
Terry, from Buckinghamshire, checked into the Metropark Hotel on
Thursday [30 Apr 2009] for 2 days but were told on Friday they and
about 300 other guests would be confined to the building for a week.
Mr Sweeney told BBC News: "Effectively we're in our rooms, apart from
going to collect meals. Some of us are using the stairs as a way of
exercise. Otherwise we're confined.

Scottish Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said there was one further
probable swine flu case in Scotland, in addition to the 4 already
confirmed. It involves a person from Fife who traveled from Las Vegas
to Edinburgh via London on 30 Apr 2009. She said 8 of the 10 people
regarded as close contacts of the man from Ayrshire on flight BE7096
on 30 Apr 2009 had been traced, none of whom were showing any
symptoms. He is thought to have picked up swine flu while in Texas
and was diagnosed with the virus on Sunday [3 May 2009].

The number of cases in London stands at 6, while other cases have
been confirmed in Newcastle, Oxfordshire, Devon, Merseyside,
Worcestershire, Gloucestershire, and Central Scotland. The 6-year-old
girl in Oxfordshire has made a full recovery, doctors have told the BBC.

Health chiefs are awaiting the results of more than 700 further
tests. Mr Benn told GMTV swine flu was so far "relatively mild and
responds well to treatment here in the UK so far. but we have got to
remain vigilant."

Dr John McCauley, a virologist at the National Institute for Medical
Research, said it was still important to prepare a good vaccine.
"It's certainly not a savage variety like the bird flu is. But still,
it's still like seasonal flu, and seasonal flu does kill," he said.

Two previous cases had seen Britons falling ill without having
traveled to Mexico. A 43-year-old, from South Gloucestershire, had
been in contact with a traveler to the country. And a resident of
Falkirk was infected through contact with the 1st British people to
develop the flu.

The HPA said all those in the UK who have contracted the disease
appear to be suffering mild symptoms. Information leaflets about how
to reduce the chances of spreading infection are due to begin
arriving in people's homes from next Tuesday [5 May 2009].

[4] On cross protection
Date: Mon 4 May 2009
From: Allen Kirchner <kirchn_a@bellsouth.net>


The question has been raised as to whether vaccination against the
seasonal flu -- the vaccine for which has for many years included
H1N1 -- would provide any protection against the emerging strain of H1N1.

I am traveling at this time and do not have access to my references,
but I think it was Sandbulte in 2007 [Cross-reactive neuraminidase
antibodies afford partial protection against H5N1 in mice and are
present in unexposed humans. Sandbulte MR, Jimenez GS, Boon AC, Smith
LR, Treanor JJ, Webby RJ. PLoS Med. 2007. - Mod.CP] who wrote about
the mitigating effects of the commonality of the neuraminidase
antigen. It was proposed that the common neuraminidase antigen, in
this case N1, would shorten the duration and lessen the severity of
infection of another subtype of influenza A with a different
hemagglutinin antigen but with the same neuraminidase. This was
proposed as one of the supporting arguments for universal seasonal
flu vaccination in the face of a possible pandemic of H5N1. It was
also suggested as an explanation of the relative non-lethality of the
1968 pandemic (H3N2) as compared to the 1957 pandemic (H2N2). In my
pandemic planning and preparedness classes, I have always used these
data as a supporting argument for universal seasonal influenza
vaccination. There has been nothing presented that suggests that this
is not a reasonable strategy.

I have read some reports from various public health officials that
suggested that seasonal flu vaccine would offer no protection against
the 2009 H1N1. I think that such advice is short-sighted, and
probably erroneous.

[5] In defense of surveillance
Date: Mon 4 May 2009
From: David Thomson <david.thomson@global.net.pg>


[A response to the critical article in the New York Times of 2 May
2009 [see: Influenza A (H1N1) - worldwide (05) 20090503.1657]
-----------------------------------------------
1. I believe that it would be unwarranted to suggest that the
surveillance systems that have been developed over recent years have,
in any way, been a failure because this virus has emerged and spread
beyond rapid containment to this stage. Emergence in a developing
country where there are a host of inter-current disease issues/events
at play will inevitably greatly complicate interpretation of data
that comes from surveillance; there are probably few diseases with
greater potential for rapid spread than flu, and emergence in
developing countries may well be the more expected situation.

The surveillance has put us on almost level terms with this disease
for the 1st time in history, and it probably won't be long before it
can put us ahead of the disease, where we really need to be, as long
as we get the support to stay the course.

2. I suspect that the coming non-flu season in the Northern
hemisphere may also present a unique opportunity. In the 1st
instance, it may not be valid to assume that this flu will follow the
seasonal pattern entirely; after all, it drew attention to itself in
Mexico because it was active at the very end or just out of the normal season.

On the other hand, however, a period of "reduced" epidemiological
activity should offer a unique opportunity to possibly get ahead of
the disease; the time to do that for highly infectious/transmissible
diseases like this is to hit them with everything whilst they are
down, because when they are up, they overwhelm. It usually requires
excellent surveillance to do that effectively because they are harder
to find, and surveillance data is harder to clearly interpret when
disease activity is low.

This, I believe, will probably be the acid test of the value of the
improved surveillance systems at global, regional and national levels.

3. This brings me my next point, if this disease is likely to be
overwhelming when it is up, it places a great deal more pressure on
keeping the disease out of or under good containment control in the
southern hemisphere, where the flu season is almost starting,
especially in temperate and sub-tropical regions.

4. I, therefore, sincerely hope that interest and support for
surveillance and control activities in the northern hemisphere do not
contract as the disease seasonally slows there (if it does that) and
likewise for the Southern hemisphere so that it does not rise to
become overwhelming there under the right seasonal conditions. If we
can keep it down in the south and it naturally wanes in the north,
enabling us to dig it out, then we may have a reasonable chance of
beating it back over the course of the coming year and thereby
possibly preventing emergence of worse in the not too distant future.
In my opinion, we must not lose sight of the good potential this
virus has for further reassortment, given the prevalence and types of
other flu viruses circulating in humans and animals at this juncture,
regardless of how "severe" this particular A(H1N1) strain may prove
to be in humans.

[6] Strain displacement
Date: Mon 4 May 2009
Source: National Public Radio [edited]
<http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103711274>


Biologists say there's a good chance that the emerging flu strain
could establish itself as the dominant strain of influenza in future
flu seasons. Three times in the last century, a substantially new flu
virus has emerged and displaced the existing strains. That's quite
different from the usual pattern in which the circulating virus
mutates just enough to keep vaccine makers tweaking their annual product.

"You can think of those strains, that vary from year to year, as
though they were cousins in the same family. They are variations on a
theme," says William Schaffner at Vanderbilt's medical school. But he
says the emergence of this new virus is different. This virus, which
originated partly in pigs, could be a game-changer. "This one is
completely new," Schaffner says. "This one is a stranger in town.
We've never seen one like this before."

The new swine flu virus has continued to spread, with more than 1000
confirmed cases and 20 deaths worldwide. All but one of the
fatalities occurred in Mexico, where officials decided Monday [4 May
2009] to allow most businesses to reopen on Wednesday. In the U.S.,
the number of confirmed cases stood at 253 in 36 states early Monday.

The new swine flu virus is not merely a case of the usual gradual
evolution. The big change scientists have seen with this strain is
called a "shift" [The term shift has usually been applied to a change
in antigenic type, e.g. from H1N1 to H2N2, etc., whereas the 2009
H1N1 is still H1N1-type. - Mod.CP]. The most infamous shift was the
virus that appeared in 1917 and caused the deadly flu pandemic of
1918. That virus then became the dominant variety of flu for several
decades. Then in 1957, it was displaced by another shift virus. There
was yet another shift in 1968, says Stephen Morse at Columbia
University's Mailman School of Public Health. "There does seem to be
a rule of thumb about this, which is that every pandemic in the 20th
century essentially established the variants that would become the
circulating seasonal influenzas until the next pandemic came along to
displace them," Morse says.

Each shift led to a stronger-than-usual flu season, but each one also
calmed down after a year or 2, once the population became exposed to
the new viruses or were vaccinated. Morse says the question now is
whether the new H1N1 swine virus will keep moving from
person-to-person efficiently. "If it continues like that, we'll
expect to see this virus chugging along, and probably the next
seasonal influenza will be a descendent of this one," Morse says.

The question, then, is how nasty the virus will end up being.
Professor John Oxford at St. Bart's and the Royal London Hospital
says there's some reason for cautious optimism. "In one sense, it's
one of the mildest shifts, because most people on the planet have got
some memory, have come across H1N1 viruses since 1978," Oxford says.

Even though health officials are calling this new virus H1N1, that's
also the type of virus that's in wide circulation today. And it has
an interesting history. It was the dominant flu virus through the
1920s, '30s and '40s. Oxford says it disappeared in 1957, when it was
displaced by another flu virus. But then a strain of H1N1 suddenly
reappeared in 1977. "Now where could it have come from?" he asks. "We
reckon now, in retrospect, it was probably released accidentally from
a laboratory, probably in northern China or just across the border in
Russia, because everyone was experimenting with those viruses at the
time in the lab." It was nothing malicious, Oxford believes, just
some flu vaccine research that broke out of containment. The
descendents of this virus are still circulating. He notes that most
people who have encountered the newly emerged H1N1 virus seem to have
developed only mild disease, and he speculates that's because we have
all been exposed to a distant cousin, the H1N1 virus that emerged in
the 1970s. "That escaped virus perhaps will provide some benefit now
in the face of this pig thing," Oxford says.

This is well-informed speculation, not iron-clad assurance. And there
is another less reassuring lesson from the previous big shifts in flu
viruses. They caused mild disease when they 1st appeared in the
spring, but they all caused big flu seasons when they returned in the
fall as the new dominant virus. That's one reason that health
officials are taking the new virus very seriously.

[Byline: Richard Harris]

[It is unwise to put much weight on speculation of this sort. There
have been few consistencies in the behavior of pandemic and
non-pandemic viruses. The descendants of 2 pandemic viruses, the H1N1
and H3N2 serotypes, were not displaced and continue to circulate
currently as seasonal influenza viruses. - Mod.CP]
