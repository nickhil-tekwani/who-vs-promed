The Blood-Horse has learned that 3 barns at Churchill Downs have been put
under quarantine because of a possible outbreak of an equine respiratory
virus. Rusty Ford of the Kentucky State Veterinarian's Office confirmed
Tuesday [17 May 2005] night an "indication" of equine herpesvirus as the
reason for the quarantine and said he was awaiting test results Wednesday
morning that could confirm the presence of the virus.
Ford did not say which trainers were affected or whether any of the barns
under quarantine contained horses scheduled to ship to Pimlico racecourse
in Baltimore, Maryland for Saturday's [21 May 2005] Preakness or other
stakes run there this weekend. 3 planeloads of horses were scheduled to
leave Louisville, Kentucky on Wednesday morning.
Among those set to leave is Kentucky Derby winner Giacomo. Ford also did
not say whether the presence of equine herpesvirus in horses at barns under
quarantine would affect shipping to Maryland of horses from other barns
stabled at Churchill Downs.
According to veterinarian Nancy S. Loving, writing in the June 2005 issue
of The Horse magazine, equine herpesvirus is classified into 5 different
strains. EHV-1 and EHV-4 are the strains associated with viral respiratory
disease. EHV-1 is the most prevalent concern in horse populations, not only
because its respiratory disease is more virulent than that caused by EHV-4,
but also because it can lead to viral abortion in mares or neurologic disease.
Fever and an upper respiratory infection are the most common signs of
EHV-1. Infected horses may show signs of lethargy, poor appetite, nasal
discharge, and a cough. An infected horse can spread the virus up to 35
feet, with a cough or snort. The virus is short-lived and susceptible to
disinfectants.
Detection of EHV-1 in 3 horses at Turfway Park in March 2003, just days
before that track's major event, the Lane's End Stakes, did not disrupt the
race, though track officials took several precautionary steps to ensure the
health of the horses at the Northern Kentucky track.
The Turfway outbreak occurred within one barn, which was put under
quarantine for 21 days. Horses shipped in to the track during that period
were housed only in the receiving barn or stakes barn, and all stalls in
those barns were stripped and thoroughly sanitized.
In a separate incident that same month [March 2003], 5 horses at Penn
National racecourse in Pennsylvania also tested positive for EHV-1. That
outbreak led officials at Philadelphia Park and at racetracks in West
Virginia to impose a temporary ban on shipping horses to and from Penn
National.
2 of the 5 horses died as a result of EHV-1. In January and February of
2003, an outbreak of EHV-1 at the University of Findlay in Ohio led to the
death of 12 horses.

2 horses put down after suspected equine herpes outbreak
-----------------------------------------------
2 horses stabled at Churchill Downs have been put down after they showed
signs of equine herpes, a highly contagious virus that affects horses'
respiratory and nervous systems, state equine agriculture officials said
Wednesday [18 May 2005].
The 2 horses euthanized in the past week have not been identified, but 3
barns with about 100 horses have been quarantined, and several other horses
have shown mild symptoms of the disease, Bob Stout, Kentucky state
veterinarian told horsemen Wednesday morning at a meeting at the track.
None of the horses being shipped from Churchill to Pimlico Race Course in
Baltimore to run in Saturday's [21 May 2005] Preakness Stakes have been
affected by the disease, said Joe De Francis, president of the Maryland
Jockey Club.
4 trainers -- Ronny Werner, Steve Asmussen, Paul McGee and Bill Cesare --
stable horses at the 3 quarantined barns, the trainers and Churchill Downs
said. None of the 4 trainers have horses entered in the Preakness.
The disease is highly contagious among horses and can be spread through
sneezing and coughing up to 35 feet away, Churchill said. Equine herpes was
1st suspected about a week ago in a horse that shipped to Churchill in mid
April 2005. The horse is believed to have come from a Florida sale, said
Rusty Ford, equine programs manager in the state veterinarian's office.

[Equine Herpesvirus is also known as Rhinopneumonitis and is a viral
disease caused by a herpesvirus. It may present as a severe respiratory
infection, but it may also cause a neurological disease, or abortion in
pregnant mares. There is a vaccine for it. The immunity inferred from the
disease or the vaccine are relatively short. Horses on the show or racing
circuit are often vaccinated every 6 months.
The fact that the horses running in the Preakness Race on Saturday are
apparently already shipped is good news and will help ease fears at Pimlico
Race Course. It does not, however, lessen the severity of the disease or
the tragedy. - Mod.TG]
