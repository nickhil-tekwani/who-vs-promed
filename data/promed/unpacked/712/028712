[The following special report amplifies the information contained in the BBC
News item posted yesterday and considers some of the issues and concerns
raised by this singular achievement. The correct references for the 2 papers
published simultaneously in Nature and Science are the following: Jeffery K.
Taubenberg et al. Nature 437, 889-893, 2005; and T. M. Tumpey et al. Science

The recreation of one of the deadliest diseases known could help us to prevent
another pandemic. Or it might trigger one, say critics.
It is thought to have killed 50 million people, and yet scientists have
brought it back to life. In this issue of Nature, scientists publish an
analysis of the full genome sequence of the 1918 human influenza virus. And in
this week's Science, researchers describe how they used that sequence to
recreate the virus and study its effects in mice.
Some scientists have already hailed the work as giving unprecedented insight
into the virus. Working out how it arose and why it was so deadly could help
experts to spot the next pandemic strain and to design appropriate drugs and
vaccines in time, they say. But others have raised concerns that the dangers
of resurrecting the virus are just too great. One biosecurity expert told
Nature that the risk that the recreated strain might escape is so high, it is
almost a certainty. And the publication of the full genome sequence gives any
rogue nation or bioterrorist group all the information they need to make their
own version of the virus. Jeffery Taubenberger of the Armed Forces Institute
of Pathology in Rockville, Maryland, is the lead author of the sequencing
study. He says the work was necessary and the risks were low. The paper gives
details of the final three genes; the sequences of the rest have already been
published. [see: Characterization of the 1918 influenza virus polymerase
genes. Jeffery K. Taubenberg, Ann H. Reid, Raina M. Lourens, Ruixue Wang,

The full sequence is strong evidence that the 1918 flu virus is derived wholly
from an ancestor that originally infected birds. In contrast, the viruses that
caused the flu pandemics of 1957 and 1968 arose when human and avian flu
viruses infected the same person at the same time, allowing their genes to mix.
All 8 of the genome segments from the 1918 virus differ in important ways from
other human flu sequences, suggesting that none of the genome came from a
strain that had previously infected people. "It is the most bird-like of all
mammalian flu viruses," says Taubenberger. Pinpointing exactly which genetic
mutations allowed the virus to jump to humans will enable scientists to
recognize other bird viruses that could trigger a pandemic. Taubenberger's
team has already identified 25 changes in the protein sequences of the 1918
strain that have been present in subsequent human flu viruses. These mutations
are likely to be particularly important, he says. One such change, in the
polymerase gene PB2, was found in the virus isolated from the only human
fatality in a 2003 outbreak of H7N7 bird flu in the Netherlands.
In the paper in Science (T. M. Tumpey et al. 310, 77 80; 2005), Terrence
Tumpey at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta,
Georgia, and his co-workers have used Taubenberger's sequence to recreate the
complete 1918 virus. When they used the strain to infect mice they found it
was extremely virulent, and after 4 days had generated 39 000 times more virus
particles in the animals' lungs than a modern flu strain. "I didn't expect it
to be as lethal as it was," says Tumpey. All the mice died within 6 days of
infection with the 1918 virus and none with a contemporary virus.
The researchers compared the complete 1918 virus with strains in which some
genes had been replaced by those of contemporary strains. They found that
replacing the haemagglutinin gene, which helps the virus to enter cells, made
it unable to kill mice. Replacing all 3 of the polymerase genes, which allow
the virus to replicate, significantly reduced its virulence. The
haemagglutinin gene is essential, says Tumpey. "But no single change or gene
is the answer," adds Taubenberger. "It's a combination effect." Future
research will involve testing reconstructed viruses with and without certain
mutations, to see which are the most important for virulence.
Information from this type of study will hopefully be of use in vaccine and
drug design, but so far the work is more about obtaining a basic understanding
of the virus than any immediate health benefits.
The studies have been praised as ground-breaking. "It's a landmark," says
Eddie Holmes, a virologist at Pennsylvania State University in University
Park. "Not only is this the 1st time this has been done for any ancient
pathogen, but it deals with the agent of the most important disease pandemic
in human history." The team got permission to do the work from CDC head Julie
Gerberding and Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases, based in Bethesda, Maryland. But the studies have
sparked fears among other researchers. "There most definitely is reason for
concern," says Richard Ebright, a bacteriologist at Rutgers University in
Piscataway, New Jersey, who serves on biosecurity panels. "Tumpey et al. have
constructed, and provided procedures for others to construct, a virus that
represents perhaps the most effective bioweapons agent now known."
"This would be extremely dangerous should it escape, and there is a long
history of things escaping," says Barbara Hatch Rosenberg, a molecular
biologist and member of the Federation of American Scientists' Working Group
on Biological Weapons. "What advantage is so much greater than that risk?"
Ebright agrees that there is a significant risk, "verging on inevitability",
of accidental release of the virus into the human population, or of theft by
a "disgruntled, disturbed or extremist laboratory employee". And there is the
danger that a hostile nation might reconstruct its own version of the virus,
he says, pointing out that any of these scenarios could result in a large
number of deaths [including, however, many in the nation that released the
virus. - Mod.JW]
Ebright also believes that using an enhanced biosafety level-3 lab for the
work was inadequate. If the researchers were going to do the work at all, they
should have used level 4, the strictest biosafety condition, he says. This
requires experimenters to wear full body suits. In 2003, he points out, a SARS
virus escaped accidentally from a level-3 lab in Singapore, and in 2004, 2
further escapes occurred from such labs in Beijing. Tumpey counters that
enhanced level 3, which requires upper body suits and respirators, is safe
enough. Disgruntled employees aren't a concern either, he says, because he is
the only one who works with the virus. The few researchers with access to the
lab undergo extensive background checks, and retina and fingerprint scans are
used to prevent any unauthorized entry to the lab. He adds that even if the
virus did escape, it wouldn't have the same consequences as the 1918 pandemic.
Most people now have some immunity to the 1918 virus because subsequent human
flu viruses are in part derived from it. And, in mice, regular flu vaccines
and drugs are at least partly effective against an infection with
reconstructed viruses that contain some of the genes from 1918 flu.
The other potential threat comes from the availability of the full genome
sequence, which has been put on the GenBank database -- a condition of the
paper's publication. Anyone can order DNA to be made to a certain sequence,
points out Jonathan Tucker, a policy analyst at the Center for
Nonproliferation Studies in Washington DC. There are currently no governmental
controls on what sequences can be used, says Tucker, although some DNA
synthesis companies now screen their orders for pathogenic sequences. If
someone wants to reconstruct the virus, says Taubenberger, "the technology is
available". Philip Campbell, editor-in-chief of Nature, says that although he
did not seek advice on whether to publish the work, he has done so for
previous flu-virulence and pathogen genome papers. He says that the benefits
clearly outweigh the risks. Donald Kennedy, editor-in-chief of Science, agrees
about the merits of publication. "I think we are going to depend on this kind
of knowledge," he says.
The US National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) reached a
similar conclusion about both studies, after calling an emergency meeting last
week to consider the risks. But, concerned about public fears, it asked the
authors of both papers to add a passage to the manuscripts stating that the
work is important for public health and was conducted safely. Campbell says he
is worried that government agencies will start seeking to be involved in the
publishing process.
"We are happy to cooperate with the NSABB to consider the principles by which
dual-use results can be published responsibly," he says. "But government
bureaucracies and committees may push to avoid perceived risks, at the
potential expense of benefits to public security."
Taubenberger admits that there can be no absolute guarantee of safety. "We are
aware that all technological advances could be misused," he says. "But what we
are trying to understand is what happened in nature and how to prevent another
pandemic. In this case, nature is the bioterrorist."
