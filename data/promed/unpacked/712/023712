Medics head to Brazzaville to probe outbreak
--------------------------------------------
A disease has killed 5 people in northern Congo and medical experts will
travel to the region to investigate whether a new Ebola outbreak has struck
there, officials said on Tuesday [10 May 2005].

At least 5 people have succumbed to an as-yet unidentified illness this
week in Cuvette West, where epidemiologists are scheduled to arrive on
Wednesday to determine if the victims died from Ebola, an often deadly
haemorrhagic fever, said Damase Bozongo, one of the country's top health
officials. "Only lab results will allow us to give the genuine causes of
the deaths," Bozongo told the Associated Press.

Bozongo said the dead had shown some signs of hemorrhagic fever -- but not
the massive bleeding that is a hallmark of Ebola, which causes rapid death
through blood loss in up to 90 per cent of those infected. Last year, 120
died of Ebola in the same Cuvette region, bordering Gabon. Bozongo also
said none of the medical personnel who handled the dead had shown signs of
Ebola, raising hopes that another deadly outbreak could be averted.

Ebola spreads through bodily fluids, generally kills rapidly, and has so
far afflicted remote regions of Africa, meaning the disease has burned out
before spreading great distances.

[The above newswire mentions an outbreak of an as yet undiagnosed fatal
illness in the Cuvette West Region of the Republic of the Congo associated
with some hemorrhagic phenomena. As mentioned in the newswires, outbreaks
of Ebola hemorrhagic fever occurred in this region in 2004 and 2003 (there
were 2 outbreaks, the first identified in January/February 2003, the second
in November 2003, with outbreak activity declared over in January
2004). Villages involved in the early 2003 outbreak included Kele and
Mbou, and in the late 2003 outbreak included Mbomo, Olloba, and
Mbandza. The 2nd of the outbreaks in 2003 were preceded by a primate
die-off that was identified as having been due to Ebola hemorrhagic
fever. There were also outbreaks in the same region in 2002 and 2001.

Insufficient information on the current outbreak is given in the above
newswire to conclude with certainty that this is due to Ebola hemorrhagic
fever, although the occurrence in a region where there have been 3 prior
outbreaks in recent years, does raise a high index of suspicion. There are
many other causes of hemorrhagic-like illnesses that could be responsible
for this outbreak, including Yellow fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and
malaria.

More information on this outbreak and information of possible primate
die-offs in the region would be appreciated (perhaps our World Wildlife
Federation colleagues may have some information on this for us.) - Mod.MPP]
