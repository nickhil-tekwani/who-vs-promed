BUENOS AIRES: Argentine beef producers said cattle in some areas are
infected with foot and mouth disease (FMD), even as the government
maintains a plan to vaccinate livestock is merely a precautionary measure
and the U.S. has decided not to restrict beef imports.
"We have animals that are sick," said Dardo Chiesa, president of the Buenos
Aires and La Pampa Confederation of Rural Associations. Chiesa said beef
producers have confirmed cases of infected animals in the 2 provinces.
In northwest Buenos Aires province, ranchers have reported 3000 to 5000
head of cattle infected, said Federico Galligo, president of the Rivadavia
Foundation for Animal Health, part of the Rivadavia Rural Society.
Beef producers' statements contradict Argentina's Agriculture Secretary
Antonio Berhongaray, who has said there have been no outbreaks of the
highly contagious virus. If the virus has infected livestock, Argentina
could face trouble regaining its disease-free status and delay the opening
of new markets for exports of its famed grass-fed beef.
Argentina lost its status as free of FMD without vaccination last week when
officials said the country would start vaccinating cattle against the virus
in some high-risk areas in a move to protect its $6.9 billion beef industry.
Argentina's problem is the latest in a series of catastrophes having shaken
world beef markets. An outbreak of FMD in the U.K. has led the European
Union to ban U.K. meat imports to prevent the spread of the virus to a
continent already fighting so-called mad cow disease.
Argentina now has to reapply to the FMD commission of the Paris-based World
Organization for Animal Health, the standard-setting body on animal health
matters for the World Trade Organization (WTO), to regain a status as free
of FMD with vaccination.
Argentina is to vaccinate 11 million head of cattle starting Thursday, said
Eduardo Greco, vice president of the country's animal and food health
inspection service, known as Senasa. That's about 22 percent of the
country's cattle population.
"Unfortunately we are late with the vaccination plan," said Chiesa.
In Rivadavia, the team in charge of vaccinating the animals, headed by
Galligo, has already begun vaccinating. Rivadavia, a zone where cattle are
brought from around the country, to be fattened before sale to
slaughterhouses, is particularly susceptible to the virus.
"This is a cattle receiving zone, it's easy for the cattle to be infected
here," said Galligo. "There is a lot of movement and exchange of animals."
Producers in Rivadavia receive cattle from several areas, including the
northern provinces of Formosa and Corrientes, regions considered at
high-risk of the disease because they border Bolivia, Paraguay, and Brazil,
none of which have been declared free of FMD without vaccination.
Galligo, who also headed the local vaccination campaign begun in the early
90s as part of a nationwide effort to eradicate the disease, said producers
kept quiet when the virus first appeared about 2 months ago in the hopes
the government would implement a strategy to contain the situation. But now
the problem has spread, he said. Galligo expects the vaccination program to
bring the situation under control in the next 30 days.
Both the U.S. and Canada blocked Argentine beef imports in early August
after cattle in northern Argentina were found carrying antibodies for the
highly contagious virus, fueling fears of a new outbreak of the disease.
The U.S. reopened its market in December and Canada did the same last month
after sending health officials to the country to evaluate the country's
sanitary situation. The U.S. yesterday approved the vaccination plan and
said it would not restrict Argentine beef imports, which are limited to 20
000 metric tons a year of fresh, boneless meat.
Argentina's Agriculture Secretary Antonio Berhongaray said the U.S.
decision "confirms the sanitary situation of Argentina, of which we have
informed all of the countries buying Argentine beef, does not affect the
export of our beef."
Still, Brazil last week decided to ban the import of meat with bone from
Argentina after meeting with Senasa President Victor Machinea. Meat with
bone made up about 3 percent of Argentine meat exports to Brazil last year,
according to Marcus Pratini de Moraes, Brazil's agriculture minister.
FMD causes sores on the feet and mouth of cloven-hoofed animals and
interferes with beef production. The virus, which is carried in the bones
of infected animals, does not affect humans.
The issue of whether Argentine cattle are infected remains to be settled
and though some provincial officials have reportedly said some Argentine
cattle are infected, the federal government insists the virus is not
present here.
U.S. health officials will have a chance to verify Argentina's claim. The
U.S. accepted Senasa's invitation to send a commission to Argentina to
evaluate the vaccination program, Argentina's agriculture department said.
