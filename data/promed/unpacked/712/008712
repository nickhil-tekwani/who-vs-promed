Eleven people died of rabies last week (11-17 May 2010) in the
country, bringing the number of deaths reported since January 2010 up to 78.

Speaking at the regular review session on the influenza and rabies
epidemiological situation, the deputy health minister, Carlos Alberto
Masseca, said the cases occurred in the provinces of Kwanza Sul, (4),
Benguela (2), Kwanza Norte (2), Cunene (2) and Uige (1).

"This picture shows a large movement of rabies virus [infection] in
the country and need to continue to strengthen measures to combat the
disease," warned the leader.

Due to the high number of bites recorded (669), Carlos Alberto
Masseca asked the provincial governments to strengthen the procedures
for the collection of stray animals from streets and public awareness
about the importance of vaccination as the primary means of
prevention against this disease.

According to the official, most provinces have already established
kennels/catteries in operation or are nearing completion of works.

In this period, he said, 3585 animals were vaccinated (dogs, cats and
monkeys), a total of 160 519 since the start of the campaign.

[As yet, the government's attempts to interrupt the transmission of
rabies virus infection in Angola are showing few signs of progress.
