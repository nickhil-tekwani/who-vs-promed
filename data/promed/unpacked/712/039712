FOLLOWUP ON OUTBREAKS: REQUEST FOR INFO
**********************************************************
A ProMED-mail post
<http://www.healthnet.org/programs/promed.html>

Have you ever read a newspaper story about an interesting event, & then
never heard any more about it, and always wondered what the outcome was?
This has been the case with a number of outbreaks weÂ´ve posted over the last
4 years, with RFIs (requests for information) to which we never got a
response.
Our Viral Diseases Moderator, Charlie Calisher, has compiled a list of these
below. If anybody can give us followup or closure on any of those rumors or
reports, we would be grateful.
