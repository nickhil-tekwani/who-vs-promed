Lassa fever, recently declared to be occurring in northern and
central Liberia, has caused 5 deaths, announced a spokesman of the
Ministry of Health, Karson Kollie, on Wednesday [18 Apr 2007]. Kollie
stated that at least 13 people have been infected by this disease,
which is transmitted by the saliva of rodents, including rats [by the
excrement and urine of the multimammate mouse, _Mastomys natalensis_
- Mod.TY]. Kollie indicated that the registered cases of Lassa fever
have been concentrated in the localities of Bong, Lofa and Nimba.

[It appears that sporadic cases of Lassa fever continue in these
areas, although the numbers of cases in the earlier reports this year
[2007] are not available, and it is unclear whether there has been an increase.
