BSE cases down but CJD on increase
----------------------------------
The BSE epidemic is starting to drop off in line with scientists'
predictions, a Government report stated yesterday. But the number of
known cases of "variant" CJD, (vCJD) the human form of the disease, has
increased to 74.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) study comes a day
after the department played down fears up to 8 more cows may have
contracted BSE because of inadequate measures to eradicate it. The
progress report outlined the measures taken to protect public health in
the 6 months from December 1999. It stated BSE cases have already shown a
dramatic decline and the situation was due to improve further in the
future.
On average about 30 new cases were being found each month, compared to
1000 a month at the height of the epidemic in 1993. The number of
infected cattle in 1999 was 30.5 percent lower than the same period in
1998. Almost two-thirds of herds with breeding cattle have never had a
case of BSE.
However, 63 people had died of vCJD by the end of June 2000, with 3
provisional victims who had already died and a further 7 still alive but
believed to have the disease. On Sunday, the Government said there was no
new outbreak of BSE. There was only 1 confirmed case of BSE in July, a
spokesman said.
