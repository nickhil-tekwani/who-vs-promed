CDC marks little progress in probe of fatal toxic infection
-----------------------------------------------------------
While the toxic bacteria behind the deaths of 5 people in Hsinyi
Township in Nantou County [Taiwan province] remains unknown, possible
bacterial sources may be contained in the home of a couple who died,
the deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said
yesterday [11 Jul 2011].

Shi Wen-yi, deputy director of the CDC said at a press conference
that neurotoxin was the most likely cause leading to the deaths of 2
couples, while the 5th fatality, may have another cause.

The blood samples taken from the 5 victims were tested by the
Institute of Forensic Medicine under the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) to
determine the nature of the toxin, and other physical samples were
subjected to microbiology testing by the CDC.

Initial findings showed that such bacteria as _Clostridium
botulinum_, _Clostridium tetani_, and _Vibrio cholerae_ were excluded
from being the toxic bacteria leading to the 5 mysterious deaths in
Hsinyi Township.

Shi said that the CDC has yet to ask for assistance from the US or
Japan in finding the cause of the 5 deaths, but will not rule out the
possibility of doing so if necessary.

[So the questions are: which neurotoxin, where did it come from, and
how was it administered or how did the victims come into contact with
it?

There is not enough information regarding these deaths and the
investigation to form a hypothesis or scenario of what happened and
what agent may be responsible. More information on this cluster from
knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.TG]
