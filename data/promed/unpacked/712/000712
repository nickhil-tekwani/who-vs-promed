A 2-year-old grade gelding in Oklahoma was euthanized on [15 Jul 2019], after testing positive for equine infectious anemia (EIA), according to [an] Equine Disease Communication Center report released on [26 Jul 2019].

A recently gathered wild burro at the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) Florence, Arizona, facility tested positive for equine infectious anemia (EIA) on [25 Jul 2019]. Officials removed the jenny on [1 Aug 2019] and quarantined the facility. No animals adopted or sold before [24 Jul 2019] were exposed.

This marks the 1st EIA case at the facility, and the Arizona state veterinarian continues to investigate the case to determine the source.

The burro did not exhibit any signs of disease, but because veterinarians EIA-test all equids entering the facility, the BLM quickly identified and addressed the positive test result. The BLM contacted people who adopted or purchased animals from the facility after [24 Jul 2019], and those 13 animals have been returned to the facility for monitoring. Until officials lift the quarantine, all adoptions and sales from the facility are on hold. After state and federal animal health officials determine it's safe to resume normal operations, they will lift the quarantine (a minimum of 60 days following the donkey's removal if no further cases are confirmed).

At this time, officials have not confirmed any additional cases in the herd. "The other 19 equines that were tested that day were negative, and we are testing another 30 that came in with (the confirmed burro)," said Arizona State Veterinarian Peter Mundschenk, DVM. "We haven't got all the testing back yet, but so far we don't know how this burro came up positive. She had been running out on the desert all her life."

Equine infectious anemia is a viral disease that attacks horses' immune systems. The virus is transmitted through the exchange of body fluids from an infected to an uninfected animal, often by blood-feeding insects such as horseflies. It can also be transmitted through the use of blood-contaminated instruments or needles.

A Coggins test screens horses' blood for antibodies indicating the presence of the EIA virus. Most states require horses to have proof of a negative Coggins test to travel across state lines.

Once an animal is infected with EIA, it is infected for life and can be a reservoir for disease spread. Not all horses show signs of disease, but those that do can exhibit the following:

- Progressive condition loss
- Muscle weakness
- Poor stamina
- Fever
- Depression
- Anemia

EIA has no vaccine and no cure. A horse diagnosed with the disease dies, is euthanized, or must be placed under extremely strict quarantine conditions (at least 200 yards from unaffected equids) for the rest of his life.

The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection (DATCP) confirms the 1st case of equine infectious anemia (EIA) in the state in almost 15 years.

A horse and a mule on the same premises in Taylor County have reportedly tested positive for EIA. There is no treatment for EIA, making the only way to prevent transmitting the disease is to humanely euthanize infected animals. [How sad. Wish we had a vaccine! - Mod.TG]

Dr. Julie McGwin, DATCP equine program veterinarian, says: "Horses not euthanized must be isolated from other horses, which is not usually feasible due to their herd nature, and the lifelong quarantine creates animal welfare issues for the infected horse. Horses surviving the initial infection become carriers of the disease and are infectious for life. It's important for horse owners to work with their veterinarian to have regular testing done for this disease as an infected horse can appear healthy."

The DATCP says EIA is an infectious and potentially fatal viral infection affecting only equine species, such as horses, ponies, zebras, mules, and donkeys. Signs of EIA can vary and may include fever and uncontrollable bleeding progressing to weakness, weight loss, depression, and, sometimes, death.

The disease is often spread through blood-feeding flies, such as horseflies and deerflies. It can also be transmitted through reused needles and syringes, blood transfusions, and other contaminated equipment.

Horse owners should implement fly control measures during fly season, sterilize all needles and syringes used for injections, clean and disinfect equipment shared between animals, and isolate any animals with an unknown EIA status until test results are confirmed as negative, according to the DATCP.

Officials say there is no evidence EIA is a public health concern. State law requires all horses coming into Wisconsin or traveling to shows be tested (also known as a Coggins test) and found negative for EIA. If any horse tests positive, state law also requires the veterinarian to report this to DATCP within 10 days.

[The best way to protect your horse is to use horse (equine) approved fly and mosquito sprays. Use of face masks may also help in areas where flies and mosquitoes are heavy.

A vaccine would certainly be appropriate, but there is not one. I cannot imagine there is lack of interest in having a vaccine against this disease. Perhaps this is due to lack of funding or outcry from horse owners. The USDA reports that "only" 1% to 2% of horses are affected. The United States has, by far, the most horses in the world -- approximately 9.5 million, according to the 2006 Global Horse Population report from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (http://veterinarynews.dvm360.com/us-has-95-million-horses-most-world-report-says).

As this was a 2006 report, the current number is likely a quite a bit higher. So using 13-year-old figures, and assuming the proposed incidence of 1% to 2% is correct, then we may be euthanizing more than 200 000 horses annually, and possibly more as we are not accounting for an increase in the equine population. If this was a human disease with an available vaccine, then how many people would be vaccinating? Likely a lot of us. We know there will always be those who choose not to vaccinate, but any infectious disease with a 1-2% incidence needs a vaccine to help fight it. - Mod.TG
