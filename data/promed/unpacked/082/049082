MENINGOCOCCAL MENINGITIS: REPORT ON 1992 SEROGROUP C OUTBREAK, US
=================================================================
[From press reports]
A study by researchers at the NCID (Natl Center for Infectious
Diseases, CDC) and the University of Illinois on the 1992
outbreak of serogroup C meningococcal meningitis that killed three
university students has raised a question on the role smoking,
drinking and dense crowds may have in spreading the disease.
The study makes these points: All 3 victims were regulars at a particular
campus bar. Employees and other patrons were found to be 20 to 40 times
more likely to catch the disease or carry the bacteria, which is usually a
harmless bacteria carried in the nose and throat. The connection between
the outbreak and the social habits of the people studied was unexpected.
More research is needed to confirm the implication that the consumption of
alcohol and smoking may have the effect of causing bacteria in the nose to
colonize, perhaps invading the body more deeply, and kill within 24 hours.
However, the leader of the study (Peter Imrey) has been quoted saying that
public health officials dealing with future outbreaks of meningococcal
disease in otherwise healthy persons, young adults in particular, may want
to consider patterns of alcohol consumption and bar patronage.
