Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi- 110 012, India. Plant
Dis. 88:426, 2004; published on-line as D-2004-0124-01N, 2004. Accepted for
publication 17 Dec 2003.
In December 2002, bottlegourd (_Lagenaria siceraria_ L.) plants grown as a
commercial crop in Pune, India (western Maharashtra) showed severe mosaic,
interveinal chlorosis, and leaf deformation that resulted in fernleaf
appearance and severe fruit distortion in approximately 70 percent of the
plants. Crude sap of collected samples was used to mechanically inoculate
uninfected glasshouse-grown bottlegourd plants that reproduced symptoms
observed in the field.
Sap extracts from these glasshouse-infected bottlegourd plants were used to
mechanically inoculate selected indicator hosts. Chlorotic local lesions
were produced on _Chenopodium amaranticolor_, and systemic symptoms were
produced on _Benincasa hispida_ (Chinese squash), _Citrullus lanatus_
(watermelon), _Cucumis sativus_ (cucumber), _Cucurbita moschata_ (pumpkin),
_Luffa cylindrica_, and _Trichosanthes anguina_.
The virus was specifically identified with serological testing using direct
antigen coating enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The virus reacted
strongly to Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV) antiserum and did not react
to Papaya ring spot virus-P (PRSV-P), Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), or
Watermelon mosaic virus (WMV) antisera. Electron microscopic examination of
leafdip preparation from infected plants showed flexuous filamentous
particles (720 to 760 nm long) that are typical of potyviruses.
Natural infection of bottlegourd by ZYMV has been reported in the Hawaiian
Islands (1). To our knowledge, this is the first report of this potentially
destructive virus in bottlegourd in India.

[ZYMV is an aphid-transmitted potyvirus that causes severe diseases in
several cucurbit species. Symptoms include mosaic, yellowing,
shoestringing, stunting, and fruit and seed deformations. ZYMV is
particularly damaging to cucurbit crops in some Mediterranean countries,
Central Europe, and the USA. Typical of aphid-transmitted viruses, it is
extremely difficult to control with insecticides, reflective mulches, or
mineral oils. Disease management involves use of resistant cultivars and
control of infected weeds from which aphids can acquire the virus.
Application of chemical insecticides is usually not economical.
