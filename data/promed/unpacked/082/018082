Migrant birds have tested positive for the H7 strain of bird flu
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The H7 strain of the bird flu virus has been detected in Egypt for
the 1st time.
A total of 9 migrant birds, all of them ducks, tested positive for
the virus when 6432 samples were taken from the approximately one
million birds that annually migrate over Al-Manzalah Lake in the
Sharqiya governorate from central and eastern Europe. The recently
identified H7 strain is thought to pose little risk, certainly in
comparison with the virulent H5N1 strain of the virus.
The H7 strain samples are now being tested at both the Ministry of
Health and Population (MOHP) and Naval Medical Research Unit (NAMRU)
laboratories in order to determine the N subtype. Avian influenza has
16 H & 9 N subtypes. Only viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes comprise
the pathogenic form of the disease, though not all H5 and H7 subtypes
cause severe disease in poultry.
Abdel-Rahman Shahin, spokesman at the MOHP, explains that the H5 and
H7 viruses are usually introduced to poultry in a low pathogenic
form. It is only after several months that they mutate into highly
pathogenic strains. The appearance of the H7 strain is therefore a
cause for concern. The virus has been known to infect humans but is
less virulent than the H5N1 strain. Shahin also warned that Egypt
must remain alert for yet other strains of the virus given that it
lies on major bird migration routes.
Since the H5N1 virus was 1st detected in poultry in Egypt in February
2006, 38 cases of human infection have been reported, of which 15
resulted in fatalities. The most recent case was a 25-year-old from
Damietta governorate, 150km [93.2 miles] north of Cairo, who tested
positive for the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus in late July [2007].
The 1st human infection by the H7 virus was reported in Britain in
1996 after a woman was diagnosed who had come into direct contact
with infected ducks. A 2nd case was reported in the USA in 2002. A
year later 89 people tested positive, 83 in Holland and the remaining
6 in Germany and Belgium. Only one human fatality has been reported
following contact with poultry infected with the H7 strain [a veterinarian].
Veterinary experts, though, warn that the presence of both the H7 and
H5N1 viruses in Egypt could facilitate further genetic mutations,
which can be caused by the combination of the 2 types of avian
influenza virus which are currently present in Egypt. A combination
of the genetic patterns of both viruses, says veterinarian Sami Taha,
could result in the appearance of a human-to-human mutation. The H7
strain's poultry-to-poultry transmission patterns are very similar to
those of the deadlier H5N1 virus which means, says Taha, it could
develop similar poultry-to-human propensities. "Air temperature has
no impact on the spread of the virus... it can easily flourish in
high and low temperatures infecting massive numbers of poultry."
Shahin insists the H7 strain poses no threat as yet to Egypt's
recently recovered poultry industry, which currently produces 2
million birds daily. Poultry remains safe to eat, and he stresses
that the new strain has only been detected in migratory birds.
Meanwhile, Minister of Agriculture and Land Reclamation Amin Abaza
issued a press release saying that 38 percent of poultry in Egypt had
been vaccinated against the H5N1 bird flu virus. Abaza notes that
while the ministry has managed to contain the virus, the fact that an
estimated 5 million people continue to raise poultry at home,
especially in the rural areas, constitutes an ongoing threat.
According to Shahin, vaccines used to combat the H5N1 strain will be
used for the H7 virus until new drugs are developed.

["...vaccines used to combat the H5N1 strain will be used for the H7
virus." Can anyone confirm that this is a viable option? If poultry
vaccines can really cross-protect across hemagglutinins, why does
anyone bother to make specific vaccines? - Mod.JW]
