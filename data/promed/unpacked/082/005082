Plague Suspected In Jefferson County
Prairie Dog Die-Off Leads To Health Warning
--------------------------------------------------
The head of Environmental Health Services for the Jefferson County
[Colorado Department of Health and Environment warned about possible
bubonic plague in the county. Dr. Jim Dale announced a large-scale
prairie dog die-off was discovered by employees of Jefferson County
Open Space in late April, 2002.

The Department of Health and Environment has investigated the area,
on Jefferson County Open Space and Chatfield State Recreation Area
property, south of West Trailmark Parkway and west of South Platte
Canyon Road, and confirms that there is evidence of a prairie dog
die-off, Dale said.

Initial investigation of the area indicates that the die-off began
several weeks ago. The department cannot confirm the cause of the
die-off until testing of flea specimens is completed within the next
three weeks. However, it is suspected that bubonic plague is the
cause. The area now has plague warning signs.

"Prairie dogs are very susceptible to plague and when a colony
becomes infected with the disease, there can be a rapid die-off such
as this" said Dale. There have been no reported human cases of plague
in the area and if precautions are taken, the disease is not
considered to be a threat to humans, according to Dale.

Health officials advise visitors and citizens in the area to take
precautions People should avoid contact with any species of wild
rodents, especially sick or dead rodents. Dogs and cats should be
confined so they cannot prey on rodents and then bring the disease
home with them. Pet owners who live close to rodent populations
should dust their pets with flea powder, following the instructions
on the label. Controlling the fleas on pets will prevent the transfer
of fleas to humans. If these reasonable precautions are taken, the
probability of contracting plague is extremely low, according to Dale.

The Health Department will continue its plague surveillance of rodent
populations in the County. Citizens are requested to report any
unusual rodent die-offs to the Jefferson County Department of Health
and Environment at (303) 271-5755.

[The introduction of plague into the US via California about a
century ago led to the spread of the infection eastward across about
halfway across the country. It did not reach the east coast. The
infection continues to be endemic in rodents in the southwestern
parts of the US including Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona and
California. Die-offs of rodents such as prairie dogs or
golden-mantled ground squirrels in these areas are certainly
suggestive of an epizootic of plague in these animals. The flea
vector of Y. pestis would rather feed on its usual host but in the
absence of a warm-blooded prairie dog, it may attempt to feed on a
human. Infection in the flea causes obstruction in the
gastrointestinal tract of the flea who regurgitates the bacilli while
attempting to feed. In addition to warnings, die off areas can be
treated with insecticides to kill the fleas. - Mod.LL
