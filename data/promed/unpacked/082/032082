Cambodia: new suspected avian influenza case in Kampot province
---------------------------------------------------------------
A 20 year old Cambodian girl has been rushed to a Vietnamese hospital with
suspected avian influenza, state media said on Wed 20 Apr 2005. The
schoolgirl from Kampot province was taken across the nearby Vietnamese
border [on Tue 19 Apr 2005] suffering a high fever and respiratory
problems, symptoms of the H5N1 virus infection that has killed 51 people in
Asia, the Tuoi Tre newspaper reported.
Doctors at the Kien Giang provincial hospital took samples for tests after
isolating the girl and putting her on a respirator. The samples will be
sent to Ho Chi Minh City's Pasteur Institute, 250 km (155 miles) away.
3 Cambodians from Kampot province have already died of avian influenza,
along with 12 Thais and 36 Vietnamese. The newspaper quoted the girl's
relatives as saying chickens had died of unknown causes near her home.
Health experts fear the virus could mutate into a form which can pass
easily among humans, and millions could die in a global pandemic. Cases in
places like Cambodia, where health and monitoring systems are rudimentary,
only sharpen the fears. The virus is now endemic in several areas of
Southeast Asia, and Viet Nam, the country hardiest hit, says it does not
expect to be able to contain avian influenza until at least 2007, because
the way it is spreading still baffles experts.

Cambodia: death in Viet Nam of suspected avian influenza case from Kampot
-----------------------------------------------
The Cambodian woman suspected of having contracted avian influenza in
Kampot province has died in a hospital in southern Viet Nam, a doctor said
today [Wed 20 Apr 2005]. The 20 year old woman was admitted early yesterday
to the hospital in Kien Giang province of Viet Nam, bordering Cambodia,
with a serious lung infection. She was connected to a respirator but died
later in the day, said hospital director Pham Van Dom.
Swab samples taken from the woman are being tested, he said. Avian
influenza is confirmed to have killed 51 people so far in Viet Nam,
Thailand and Cambodia since a severe strain of the disease emerged in late
2003 to strike poultry farms across the region. Cambodia has reported 3
deaths, Thailand 12 and Viet Nam 36.
The woman's relatives said there were dead chickens in her neighborhood and
that she ate chicken 8 days before falling ill, today's [Wed 20 Apr 2005]
Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper reported. In January [2005], a 25 year old
Cambodian woman, also from Kampot province, died of avian influenza in the
same hospital. Dom said Cambodians often crossed the border to seek medical
care at the hospital, which provides better treatment than hospitals in
their country.
Health authorities in Cambodia said they had no independent information on
the case, but were investigating. "The 1st thing we're going to do is to
try and verify the rumor and get our network to find out if she does
actually test positive for avian influenza," said Megge Miller, an
epidemiologist working with the World Health Organization in Cambodia.
Experts have said the virus is now endemic in many parts of the region.
Thailand, and other countries in the region where bird flu is now under
control, must help their poorer neighbors, together with the rest of the
world, urged Robert Webster, an influenza expert from St Jude Children's
Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. "If one of these viruses does
transmit human to human, it's a global problem, so it has to be a global
effort that helps these countries, not just the local countries," said
Webster, speaking today [Wed 20 Apr 2005] on the sidelines of a meeting of
parliamentarians from the Association of South East Asian Nations in Bangkok.

[If the death of this young woman is confirmed as a case of avian influenza
infection, it will be the 4th case of human H5N1 influenza virus infection
to have been contracted in Cambodia this year [2005]. All the cases have
been contracted in Kampot province close to the Vietnamese border. The 3
confirmed cases and this suspected case have all had a fatal outcome, in
contrast to the situation in Viet Nam, where almost half of those infected
have survived. This may be due to more active surveillance in Viet Nam
together with detection and treatment of milder cases. There is no evidence
of human-to-human transmission associated with this suspected case. Contact
with and/or consumption of diseased birds is the suggested route of
infection. - Mod.CP]
