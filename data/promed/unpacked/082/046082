A student of Federal Government Girls College, FGGC, Langtang in Plateau State has been confirmed dead as a result of fresh outbreak of Lassa fever, the State Commissioner for Health, Kuden Kamshak confirmed.

He added modality has been put in place to curtail its spread as the disease is not new to the State. Also, a statement issued yesterday [Fri 7 Jul 2017] after the burial of the deceased student and signed by Nkiruka Pedro-Iyalla, for the Exco of the School's Old Girls' Association said, "the student passed away at the Jos University Teaching Hospital (JUTH) on [Sat 1 Jul 2017] after showing symptoms of Typhoid Fever."

The Association which had been in close touch with the School authority added, "There were rumours of several other students also being ill with the same symptoms who were sent home. But this turns out to be incorrect as 3 other students were confirmed to be admitted at JUTH and are being treated for different ailments. "One of them was being treated for perforated intestine and has had surgery; the other fell and injured herself while the 3rd is being managed for renal problems."

Mr Magaji, a senior member of staff at the school, personally visited the family of the deceased and the girls being treated at JUTH over the weekend." Meanwhile, the school Authority has taken steps to help forestall any major health outbreak as the resumption of students from Mid-term break has been moved by one week. Instead of 2 July 2017, the students will be expected back on 9 July 2017.

All the water sources at the school have been treated and representatives of the Plateau State Water Board have taken samples for testing and fumigation of the entire school compound is ongoing and should be concluded today [Sat 8 Jul 2017].

The SS3 girls are currently in the school on Extension and so far, none of the girls is ill. The head nurse at the clinic has also confirmed that none of the SS3 students has reported any illness in the past 2 weeks.

[The numbers of cases and deaths from Lass fever continue to slowly increase. As noted in earlier comments, Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or their excreta. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients.

Images of _Mastomys_ mice, the rodent reservoir of Lass fever virus, can be seen at https://www.ispotnature.org/communities/southern-africa/view/observation/414595/multimammate-mouse.

Once again, Dr Olutayo Olajide Babalobi is thanked for sending in the above Epidemiological Report. - Mod.TY
