Pashupati Kali and Pushpa Kali, 2 female elephants above 60, died
inside Chitwan National Park (CNP) due to tuberculosis (TB). 2 more
elephants -- Laxmi Kali and Binayak Prasad -- are being treated for
TB and 6 have already been cured for the disease in CNP in the last 5
months. In Bardiya, 2 elephants are being treated for TB and in
Shuklaphanta one elephant is undergoing treatment.

More and more domestic and wild elephants are contracting TB due to
lack of proper diet and over exertion, officials said.

Chief warden of CNP Narendra Man Babu Pradhan said, "The cause of TB
is less intake of diet in comparison to workload. It is just like in
humans. It is infectious and can easily spread from humans to the
animals and vice versa."

Pradhan said the TB detecting kits imported from the US have made it
easier to detect TB in elephants.

"One reason behind the spread of TB among elephants is also low
immunity," said Dr Sarad Paudel, a graduate of Institute of
Agriculture and Animal Science who is working in the field since 2007.

The Elephant Care International, a US-based NGO, launched Nepal
Elephant Healthcare and TB Surveillance Program in 2007 jointly with
WWF-Nepal and Nepali veterinarians.

The program has so far identified 230 domestic elephants all over
Nepal and 190 were short-listed for tests. Of these, 133 were tested
for TB and 29 of them confirmed positive. But only 22 elephants have
been treated or are being treated.

"So far 22 elephants in Chitwan, Bardiya and Shuklaphanta have been
treated for TB. We will soon launch this program in Koshi and Parsa,"
Dr Paudel said.

Paudel claimed that 19 elephants treated in Chitwan have reported
progress with considerable weight gain. "Most elephants have been
detected with latent form of TB, which is mild and is thus curable,"
Paudel said.

Of the 190 elephants tested, 160 were from Chitwan. The program also
aims to test the mahouts [those who work with, ride, and tend an
elephant] and others who come in direct contact with the elephants.

Meanwhile, the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation
(DNPWC) is organizing a 2-day meeting of all Elephant Range Countries
(ERCs) from 20-21 May 2010 to share Nepal's experience on elephant
TB. "A meeting of all parties concerned will be organized to
highlight the problem of TB among elephants in Asia and to seek joint
action in this area," Gopal Upadhyaya, the director general of DNPWC, said.

Nepal is taken as a model country in the fight against elephant TB.
The ERCs include Nepal, India, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, Burma,
Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, China, and Viet Nam.

The meeting is supported by WWF-Nepal and National Trust for Nature
Conservation.

One-fourth of the estimated 60 000 Asian elephants remaining on earth
are captive. Most of the captive elephants live in Asia where they
are used for work, ceremonies, and eco-tourism and they have not been
systematically evaluated for TB.

Due to close proximity to humans, high prevalence of TB among humans
in range countries makes TB a serious threat to this endangered
species. Since 1994, 12 percent of Asian elephants have been
diagnosed with TB in the US.

[Elephants are known to be susceptible to infection by both
_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ and _M. bovis_. The article above does
not specify the bacteria identified in the Nepali elephants. The
issue has been covered in several previous ProMED-mail postings; see
detailed commentary in posting 20090517.1844.

Alarmingly, at least one case of multidrug-resistant-TB (MDR-TB) has
occurred in an elephant in the United States. Because MDR-TB has
increased in human populations and in view of the fact that some
elephants are being inadequately treated (typically with single-drug
therapy), MDR-TB is expected to be found in captive range country
elephants. TB-infected elephants are a potential reservoir that could
infect humans and wildlife, perhaps even with more virulent and novel
forms of TB.

Regarding treatment, the same drugs that are used in humans are also
used in elephants. The main or "1st line" drugs are isoniazid (INH),
rifampin (RIF), ethambutol (ETH), and pyrazinamide (PZA). PZA is not
effective against _M. bovis_ and can only be used if the causative
agent is _M. tuberculosis_ . A precise (scale) weight is essential to
determine accurate drug doses. INH and PZA can be given orally or
rectally; RIF and ETH must be given orally. The duration of the
treatment is, generally, one year.
