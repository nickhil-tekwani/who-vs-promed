The death toll from a cholera outbreak in Angola has hit 1109 and the
disease has spread to another province, officials said today, 5 May
2006. Almost 100 delegates attended a meeting of national health
authorities in the capital Luanda to consider the latest report on
the outbreak, which said that more than 27 700 people have been
sickened by the disease in 11 of the country's 18 provinces.
The fatality rate of about 4 percent is far above the 1 percent which
the WHO considers an average for cholera. Deputy Health Minister
Jose Van Dunem said the government's emergency plans estimate up to
250 000 people will fall ill before the disease is brought under
control, due to squalid living conditions and cultural attitudes
towards cleanliness.

At least 10 people have died in the past 2 weeks in western Ethiopia
following a diarrhea outbreak suspected to be due to cholera, health
officials said Mon, 1 May 2006. Turuwork Tafesse, director of
disease surveillance, said the 10 died in the western Gambella
region, where the French charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said
286 people have been admitted in the last week alone. "We suspect
cholera, but we haven't confirmed it yet," Turuwork told AFP, adding
that samples had been taken for analysis.
"It is a concern for us," said William Robertson, MSF's
representative in Ethiopia. "We are at the very early stage of an
intervention that could last 3 or 4 months."
In 2002, when the diarrhea epidemic last erupted, the health ministry
did not confirm whether it was cholera.

[Unauthorized colonies exist in and around Delhi and other large
cities, practically taking up all open and vacant land everywhere.
These have been developed totally without any regulation either of
layout or of building construction.
Regularized (or unauthorized, regularized) colonies are those which
seem have a increasing legal status while urbanized villages are
those rural villages that have been upgraded in sophistication.
A JJ (Jhugi Jhopdi) cluster is a slum of group of small roughly built
houses or shelters usually made of mud, wood, or metal having a
thatch or tin roof. - Mod.LL]
