[Zhambyl oblast/Zhambylskaya/Jambyl region is on the southern border with Kyrgyzstan: see http://annamap.com/kazakhstan/kazakhstan-map.jpg and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=5701233,63912.

This is a typical farm for the area with a small dairy herd and flock of sheep and goats. The dairy cows will be receiving a dairy feed supplement and I suspect that this contains some contaminated bone meal. As it is still effectively winter there will be only limited grazing. If I am correct in my supposition, we should expect to see other herds in the area receiving this supplement demonstrating cases. A give-away with such outbreaks is that the genomics of the recovered _B. anthracis_ may contain a mixture of genotypes reflecting a mixed source of bones from a number of scattered outbreaks. - Mod.MHJ]
