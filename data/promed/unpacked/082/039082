El Salvador: Dengue Fever Alert
-------------------------------
After the deaths of 3 people, Salvadoran health officials announced a
dengue fever epidemic in 3 provinces and placed the rest of the
country on alert on Tue 4 Jun 2002. "We must all work together to
eradicate the mosquito because it is the only way to combat dengue,"
said Health Minister Jose Lopez. So far this year, dengue has killed
3 children under the age of 9. The ministry said about 1031 people
have been affected since January, 83 of whom by the more dangerous
hemorrhagic variety.
The epidemic covers the central departments of La Libertad and San
Salvador, and the western department of Santa Ana. The Health
Ministry and the National Emergency Committee (COEN) have beefed up
fumigation efforts in homes, and along rivers and streams to
forestall reproduction of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito which carries
the disease from one human to another. [_Aedes aegypti_ breeds in
small containers, not in rivers or streams. - Mod.JW]

El Salvador: Heavy Rainfall Associated Disease Outbreaks
--------------------------------------------------------
El Salvador's Health Ministry warned of an increase in the
[incidence] of dengue fever and respiratory disease due to incessant
rainfall in the Central American country. Authorities recommended
that Salvadorans protect themselves against diseases common to the
rainy season, according to reports reaching here from San Salvador,
the capital of El Salvador.
The Health Ministry considers the 6756 influenza cases registered
this year in El Salvador as being alarming, while the number of
dengue fever cases has grown to 890, with 3 dead. Of the dengue fever
cases, 75 were of the hemorrhagic type.
The Health Ministry's epidemiology chief Ronaldo Hernandez said the
amount of rain falling in the latest days surpassed 100 millimeters,
forcing authorities to reinforce the campaign against dengue fever.
