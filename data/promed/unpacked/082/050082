According to various press reports, Angelo's New York Style Pizza and Bistro, a Cartersville-based restaurant has come forward to address the controversy surrounding a foodborne illness outbreak that the Georgia Department of Public Health is investigating after the pizza joint catered food at an employee event last week at Toyo Tire.

Angelo's New York Style Pizza and Bistro is speaking out through its attorney, John T Mroczko, who issued a statement [on Tue 21 Nov 2017], in the light of the 2 hospitalizations and dozens of people reporting illnesses over the last few days. "Angelo and his family are heartbroken about the recent incident at Toyo Tire and offer their deepest sympathies and prayers to those who have been affected," Mroczko said. "This community is their home and their customers are like family to them. As such, the safety of their customers and the quality of their food has always been their highest priority."

While the Georgia Department of Public Health and Bartow County environmental health specialists have not identified the cause of the outbreak and all parties, the restaurant has voluntarily closed its doors to figure out the cause and "swiftly resolve the situation," Mroczkos said. The state department's Northwest Health District said that while news and other social media outlets have indicated salmonella as the cause of the illnesses, that detail has not been confirmed, as "conclusive" test results are not expected back until the week of [27 Nov 2017].

Investigators are working with Toyo Tire's human resources department to obtain more details about the outbreak from their employees. It was estimated on [Mon 20 Nov 2017] that as many as 1800 employees could have been affected by the outbreak. Cartersville Medical Center spokesperson Ginger Tyra said 2 people were hospitalized and more than 40 patients were treated in its emergency room for symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.

[The incubation period between ingestion of the alleged vehicle of transmission, whether fever occurred and how long the illness lasted for should provide clues on whether salmonellosis occurred. - Mod.LL
