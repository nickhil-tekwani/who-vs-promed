[1] Obesity and disease severity

People with extra weight may struggle to mount a robust immune response to the coronavirus -- and may respond poorly to a vaccine. In early April [2020], EMC woke up to find her hands tied to her hospital bed. She had spent the past 4 days on a ventilator in a hospital in St Louis County, Missouri, thrashing and kicking under sedation as she battled a severe case of COVID-19. "They told me, 'You were a real fighter down there,'" [she] recalled, a 68-year-old African-American retiree with a history of diabetes and heart problems. She weighed close to 300 pounds [136 kg] when she caught the coronavirus, which ravaged her lungs and kidneys. Nearly 6 months later, she feels proud to have pulled through the worst. "They said people with the conditions I have, normally, this goes the other way," she said.

As rates of obesity continue to climb in the United States [note 32% of people in the US are considered obese. - Mod.LK], its role in COVID-19 is a thorny scientific question. A flurry of recent studies has shown that people with extra weight are more susceptible than others to severe bouts of disease. And experiments in animals and human cells have demonstrated how excess fat can disrupt the immune system.

But the relationship between obesity and COVID-19 is complex, and many mysteries remain. Excess weight tends to go hand in hand with other medical conditions, like high blood pressure and diabetes, which may by themselves make it harder to fight COVID-19. Obesity also disproportionately affects people who identify as Black or Latino -- groups at much higher risk than others of contracting and dying from COVID-19, in large part because of exposure at their workplaces, limited access to medical care, and other inequities tied to systemic racism. And people with extra weight must grapple with persistent stigma about their appearance and health, even from doctors, further imperiling their prognosis.

"A new pandemic is now laying itself on top of an ongoing epidemic," said Dr Christy Richardson, an endocrinologist at SSM Health in Missouri. Regarding obesity's effects on infectious disease, she said, "We are still learning, but it's not difficult to understand how the body can become overwhelmed."

The correlations between COVID-19 and obesity are worrisome. In one report published last month [August 2020], researchers found that people with obesity who caught the coronavirus were more than twice as likely to end up in the hospital and nearly 50 percent more likely to die of COVID-19. Another study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, showed that among nearly 17 000 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the United States, more than 77 percent had excess weight or obesity.

Similar links were unmasked during the H1N1 flu pandemic of 2009 when researchers began to notice that infected people with obesity were more likely to wind up in the hospital and to die. Flu vaccines administered in subsequent years performed poorly in individuals with extra weight, who fell ill more often than their peers even after getting their shots.

"Obesity resets human physiology," said Dr Anne Dixon, a pulmonologist at the University of Vermont Medical Center who studies how excess weight can affect respiratory conditions like asthma. "People who are very obese are living on sort of a precarious position. This is not just cosmetic."

Experts said part of obesity's threat is mechanical: large amounts of fat, for instance, can compress the lower parts of the lungs, making it harder for them to expand when people breathe in. The blood of people with obesity also seems to be more prone to clotting, plugging up delicate vessels throughout the body, and starving tissues of oxygen.

Fat, or adipose tissue, can also send out hormones and other signals that make nearby cells go haywire. "Adipose tissue is very active," said Rebekah Honce, a virologist at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Tennessee and an author on a recent review describing how metabolism intersects with immunity. "It's not a dormant tissue."

One of fat's most potent effects appears to involve quelling the body's initial immune response to the virus, allowing the pathogen to spread unchecked. Eventually, the body's immune soldiers get their act together. But this delayed assault might do more harm than good: When late-arriving immune cells and molecules finally rouse themselves into action, they go berserk, driving uncontrolled bouts of inflammation throughout the body.

These aberrant early responses can have severe long-term consequences as well, said Melinda Beck, who studies how nutrition affects immunity at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The constant inflammation, she said, can wear away at the immune system's ability to generate a long-lived population of "memory" cells, which store intelligence about past encounters with pathogens.

Similar trends have been noted in the immune systems of elderly patients, who also struggle to marshal effective defenses against pathogens. When obesity enters the picture, Dr Beck said, some of the immune cells found in 30-year-old people "look like those of an 80-year-old."

These problems could have a big impact on the first coronavirus vaccines, Dr Beck said. If the immune systems of people with obesity are more prone to pathogen amnesia, then they may need different dosages of a vaccine. Some products might not work at all in people carrying extra weight.

But little attention has been paid to these risks in ongoing vaccine trials. When asked if they were testing the effects of weight on vaccine effectiveness, representatives from Novavax and AstraZeneca, 2 of the leaders among companies in the race for a coronavirus vaccine, said there were no public plans to investigate the issue. Representatives from their competitors Moderna and Pfizer did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

Johnson & Johnson, whose coronavirus vaccine candidate entered late-stage clinical trials this month [September 2020], is enrolling people with obesity, according to a company spokesman, Jake Sargent. The company "will have the opportunity to evaluate this question during development," he said.

Like many other conditions that can exacerbate COVID-19, excess weight does not have a quick fix -- especially in areas where access to healthy food and opportunities for exercise are vastly uneven among communities. "If we don't address these social underpinnings, I think we'll continue to see a recurrence of what is happening now," said Dr Jennifer Woo Baidal, a pediatric weight management specialist at Columbia University.

A few months after EMC got sick, her younger sister, EF, 62, began to experience terrible headaches. Her physical symptoms haven't been the only hardship. Ms F, who is overweight, said she had been irritated by incessant messaging in news reports blaming illnesses like hers on excess fat. "The way they were saying it is that because you're obese and didn't take care of yourself, you'll get this disease," EF said. "I feel like that was unfair." Even medical professionals show bias when caring for patients with excess weight, said Dr Benjamin Singer, a pulmonologist at the University of Michigan and an author on a recent review of obesity's influence on immunity. Studies have shown that doctors tend to be more dismissive of patients with obesity and may brush off worrisome symptoms as irrelevant side effects of their weight. Drug dosages and diagnostic machines are also often incompatible with patients carrying excess weight, making it difficult to tailor treatments. Such interactions can be a powerful disincentive to some of the people who most need care.

"These are not easy conversations," said Dr Kanakadurga Singer, a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of Michigan. (She and Dr Benjamin Singer are married.) Not everyone who weighs more than average is unwell, she said. "It's more than just the numbers, and it's not just the weight we should focus on."

In St Louis County, Ms MC and Ms F have recovered well, though both sisters still grapple with lingering symptoms. Ms MC has occasional fatigue and an intermittent cough. "I can't talk like I did before," she said. Ms F's headaches never disappeared, and her mind now feels constantly clouded by a fog.

"In the 1st metaanalysis of its kind, published on 26 Aug 2020 in Obesity Reviews, an international team of researchers pooled data from scores of peer-reviewed papers capturing 399 000 patients. They found that people with obesity who contracted SARS-CoV-2 were 113% more likely than people of healthy weight to land in the hospital, 74% more likely to be admitted to an ICU, and 48% more likely to die.

"A constellation of physiological and social factors drives those grim numbers. The biology of obesity includes impaired immunity, chronic inflammation, and blood that's prone to clot, all of which can worsen COVID-19. And because obesity is so stigmatized, people with obesity may avoid medical care.

"People with obesity are more likely than normal-weight people to have other diseases that are independent risk factors for severe COVID-19, including heart disease, lung disease, and diabetes. They are also prone to metabolic syndrome, in which blood sugar levels, fat levels, or both are unhealthy and blood pressure may be high. A recent study from Tulane University of 287 hospitalized COVID-19 patients found that metabolic syndrome itself substantially increased the risks of ICU admission, ventilation, and death."

"Summary
--------
"The linkage of individuals with obesity and COVID‐19 is controversial and lacks systematic reviews. After a systematic search of the Chinese and English language literature on COVID‐19, 75 studies were used to conduct a series of meta‐analyses on the relationship of individuals with obesity-COVID‐19 over the full spectrum from risk to mortality. A systematic review of the mechanistic pathways for COVID‐19 and individuals with obesity is presented. Pooled analysis show individuals with obesity were more at risk for COVID‐19 positive, more than 46.0% higher (OR = 1.46; 95% CI, 1.30-1.65; p less than 0.0001); for hospitalization, 113% higher (OR = 2.13; 95% CI, 1.74-2.60; p less than 0.0001); for ICU admission, 74% higher (OR = 1.74; 95% CI, 1.46-2.08); and for mortality, 48% increase in deaths (OR = 1.48; 95% CI, 1.22-1.80; p less than 0.001). Mechanistic pathways for individuals with obesity are presented in depth for factors linked with COVID‐19 risk, severity, and their potential for diminished therapeutic and prophylactic treatments among these individuals. Individuals with obesity are linked with large significant increases in morbidity and mortality from COVID‐19. There are many mechanisms that jointly explain this impact. A major concern is that vaccines will be less effective for individuals with obesity.' - Mod.LK]

There's something strange about this coronavirus pandemic. Even after months of extensive research by the global scientific community, many questions remain open. Why, for instance, was there such an enormous death toll in northern Italy, but not the rest of the country? Just 3 contiguous regions in northern Italy have 25 000 of the country's nearly 36 000 total deaths; just one region, Lombardy, has about 17 000 deaths. Almost all of these were concentrated in the 1st few months of the outbreak. What happened in Guayaquil, Ecuador, in April [2020], when so many died so quickly that bodies were abandoned in the sidewalks and streets? Why, in the spring of 2020, did so few cities account for a substantial portion of global deaths, while many others with similar density, weather, age distribution, and travel patterns were spared? What can we really learn from Sweden, hailed as a great success by some because of its low case counts and deaths as the rest of Europe experiences a 2nd wave, and as a big failure by others because it did not lock down and suffered excessive death rates earlier in the pandemic? Why did widespread predictions of catastrophe in Japan not bear out? The baffling examples go on.

I've heard many explanations for these widely differing trajectories over the past 9 months -- weather, elderly populations, vitamin D, prior immunity, herd immunity -- but none of them explains the timing or the scale of these drastic variations. But there is a potential, overlooked way of understanding this pandemic that would help answer these questions, reshuffle many of the current heated arguments, and, crucially, help us get the spread of COVID-19 under control.

By now many people have heard about R0 -- the basic reproductive number of a pathogen, a measure of its contagiousness on average. But unless you've been reading scientific journals, you're less likely to have encountered k, the measure of its dispersion. The definition of k is a mouthful, but it's simply a way of asking whether a virus spreads in a steady manner or in big bursts, whereby one person infects many, all at once. After 9 months of collecting epidemiological data, we know that this is an overdispersed pathogen, meaning that it tends to spread in clusters, but this knowledge has not yet fully entered our way of thinking about the pandemic -- or our preventive practices.

The now-famed R0 (pronounced as "r-naught") is an average measure of a pathogen's contagiousness or the mean number of susceptible people expected to become infected after being exposed to a person with the disease. If one ill person infects 3 others on average, the R0 is 3. This parameter has been widely touted as a key factor in understanding how the pandemic operates. News media have produced multiple explainers and visualizations for it. Movies praised for their scientific accuracy on pandemics are lauded for having characters explain the "all-important" R0. Dashboards track its real-time evolution, often referred to as R or Rt, in response to our interventions. (If people are masking and isolating or immunity is rising, a disease can't spread the same way anymore, hence the difference between R0 and R.)

Unfortunately, averages aren't always useful for understanding the distribution of a phenomenon, especially if it has widely varying behavior. If Amazon's CEO, Jeff Bezos, walks into a bar with 100 regular people in it, the average wealth in that bar suddenly exceeds USD 1 billion. If I also walk into that bar, not much will change. Clearly the average is not that useful a number to understand the distribution of wealth in that bar, or how to change it. Sometimes, the mean is not the message. Meanwhile, if the bar has a person infected with COVID-19, and if it is also poorly ventilated and loud, causing people to speak loudly at close range, almost everyone in the room could potentially be infected -- a pattern that's been observed many times since the pandemic began, and that is similarly not captured by R. That's where the dispersion comes in.

There are COVID-19 incidents in which a single person likely infected 80 percent or more of the people in the room in just a few hours. But, at other times, COVID-19 can be surprisingly much less contagious. Overdispersion and super-spreading of this virus are found in research across the globe. A growing number of studies estimate that a majority of infected people may not infect a single other person. A recent paper found that in Hong Kong, which had extensive testing and contact tracing, about 19 percent of cases were responsible for 80 percent of transmission, while 69 percent of cases did not infect another person. This finding is not rare: Multiple studies from the beginning have suggested that as few as 10 to 20 percent of infected people may be responsible for as much as 80 to 90 percent of transmission and that many people barely transmit it.

This highly skewed, imbalanced distribution means that an early run of bad luck with a few super-spreading events, or clusters, can produce dramatically different outcomes even for otherwise similar countries. Scientists looked globally at known early-introduction events, in which an infected person comes into a country, and found that in some places, such imported cases led to no deaths or known infections, while in others, they sparked sizable outbreaks. Using genomic analysis, researchers in New Zealand looked at more than half the confirmed cases in the country and found a staggering 277 separate introductions in the early months, but also that only 19 percent of introductions led to more than one additional case. A recent review shows that this may even be true in congregate living spaces, such as nursing homes, and that multiple introductions may be necessary before an outbreak takes off. Meanwhile, in Daegu, South Korea, just one woman, dubbed Patient 31, generated more than 5000 known cases in a megachurch cluster.

Unsurprisingly, SARS-CoV, the previous incarnation of SARS-CoV-2 that caused the 2003 SARS outbreak, was also overdispersed in this way: The majority of infected people did not transmit it, but a few super-spreading events caused most of the outbreaks. MERS, another coronavirus cousin of SARS, also appears overdispersed, but luckily, it does not -- yet -- transmit well among humans.

This kind of behavior, alternating between being super infectious and fairly noninfectious, is exactly what k captures, and what focusing solely on R hides. Samuel Scarpino, an assistant professor of epidemiology and complex systems at Northeastern, told me that this has been a huge challenge, especially for health authorities in Western societies, where the pandemic playbook was geared toward the flu -- and not without reason because pandemic flu is a genuine threat. However, influenza does not have the same level of clustering behavior.

We can think of disease patterns as leaning deterministic or stochastic: In the former, an outbreak's distribution is more linear and predictable; in the latter, randomness plays a much larger role and predictions are hard, if not impossible, to make. In deterministic trajectories, we expect what happened yesterday to give us a good sense of what to expect tomorrow. Stochastic phenomena, however, don't operate like that--the same inputs don't always produce the same outputs, and things can tip over quickly from one state to the other. As Scarpino told me, "Diseases like the flu are pretty nearly deterministic and R0 (while flawed) paints about the right picture (nearly impossible to stop until there's a vaccine)." That's not necessarily the case with super-spreading diseases.

Nature and society are replete with such imbalanced phenomena, some of which are said to work according to the Pareto principle, named after the sociologist Vilfredo Pareto. Pareto's insight is sometimes called the 80/20 principle -- 80 percent of outcomes of interest are caused by 20 percent of inputs -- though the numbers don't have to be that strict. Rather, the Pareto principle means that a small number of events or people are responsible for the majority of consequences. This will come as no surprise to anyone who has worked in the service sector, for example, where a small group of problem customers can create almost all the extra work. In cases like those, booting just those customers from the business or giving them a hefty discount may solve the problem, but if the complaints are evenly distributed, different strategies will be necessary.

Similarly, focusing on the R alone, or using a flu-pandemic playbook, won't necessarily work well for an overdispersed pandemic. Hitoshi Oshitani, a member of the National COVID-19 Cluster Taskforce at Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare and a professor at Tohoku University who told me that Japan focused on the overdispersion impact from early on, likens his country's approach to looking at a forest and trying to find the clusters, not the trees. Meanwhile, he believes, the Western world was getting distracted by the trees, and got lost among them. To fight a super-spreading disease effectively, policy makers need to figure out why super-spreading happens, and they need to understand how it affects everything, including our contact-tracing methods and our testing regimes.

There may be many different reasons a pathogen super-spreads. Much is still unknown about the super-spreading of SARS-CoV-2. It might be that some people are super-emitters of the virus, in that they spread it a lot more than other people. Like other diseases, contact patterns surely play a part: A politician on the campaign trail or a student in a college dorm is very different in how many people they could potentially expose compared with, say, an elderly person living in a small household. However, looking at 9 months of epidemiological data, we have important clues to some of the factors.

In study after study, we see that super-spreading clusters of COVID-19 almost overwhelmingly occur in poorly ventilated, indoor environments where many people congregate over time -- weddings, churches, choirs, gyms, funerals, restaurants, and such -- especially when there is loud talking or singing without masks. For super-spreading events to occur, multiple things have to be happening at the same time, and the risk is not equal in every setting and activity, Muge Cevik, a clinical lecturer in infectious diseases and medical virology at the University of St Andrews and a co-author of a recent extensive review of transmission conditions for COVID-19, told me.

Cevik identifies "prolonged contact, poor ventilation, [a] highly infectious person, [and] crowding" as the key elements for a super-spreader event. Super-spreading can also occur indoors beyond the 6-feet [2-meter] guideline, because SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen causing COVID-19, can travel through the air and accumulate, especially if ventilation is poor. Given that some people infect others before they show symptoms, or when they have very mild or even no symptoms, it's not always possible to know if we are highly infectious ourselves. We don't even know if there are more factors yet to be discovered that influence super-spreading. But we don't need to know all the sufficient factors that go into a super-spreading event to avoid what seems to be a necessary condition most of the time: many people, especially in a poorly ventilated indoor setting, and especially not wearing masks. As Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at the University of Florida, told me, given the huge numbers associated with these clusters, targeting them would be very effective in getting our transmission numbers down.

Overdispersion should also inform our contact-tracing efforts. In fact, we may need to turn them upside down. Right now, many states and nations engage in what is called forward or prospective contact tracing. Once an infected person is identified, we try to find out with whom they interacted afterward so that we can warn, test, isolate, and quarantine these potential exposures. But that's not the only way to trace contacts. And, because of overdispersion, it's not necessarily where the most bang for the buck lies. Instead, in many cases, we should try to work backwards to see who first infected the subject.

Because of overdispersion, most people will have been infected by someone who also infected other people, because only a small percentage of people infect many at a time, whereas most infect zero or maybe one person. As Adam Kucharski, an epidemiologist and the author of the book The Rules of Contagion, explained to me, if we can use retrospective contact tracing to find the person who infected our patient, and then trace the forward contacts of the infecting person, we are generally going to find a lot more cases compared with forward-tracing contacts of the infected patient, which will merely identify potential exposures, many of which will not happen anyway, because most transmission chains die out on their own.

Indeed, as Kucharski and his co-authors show mathematically, overdispersion means that "forward tracing alone can, on average, identify at most the mean number of secondary infections (that is, R)"; in contrast, "backward tracing increases this maximum number of traceable individuals by a factor of 2-3, as index cases are more likely to come from clusters than a case is to generate a cluster." Even in an overdispersed pandemic, it's not pointless to do forward tracing to be able to warn and test people, if there are extra resources and testing capacity. But it doesn't make sense to do forward tracing while not devoting enough resources to backward tracing and finding clusters, which cause so much damage.

Another significant consequence of overdispersion is that it highlights the importance of certain kinds of rapid, cheap tests. Consider the current dominant model of test and trace. In many places, health authorities try to trace and find forward contacts of an infected person: everyone they were in touch with since getting infected. They then try to test all of them with expensive, slow, but highly accurate PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests. But that's not necessarily the best way when clusters are so important in spreading the disease.

PCR tests identify RNA segments...

Meanwhile, researchers have shown that rapid tests that are very accurate for identifying people who do not have the disease, but not as good at identifying infected individuals, can help us contain this pandemic. ...

In an overdispersed regime, identifying transmission events (someone infected someone else) is more important than identifying infected individuals. Consider an infected person and their 20 forward contacts -- people they met since they got infected. Let's say we test 10 of them with a cheap, rapid test and get our results back in an hour or two. This isn't a great way to determine exactly who is sick out of that 10, because our test will miss some positives, but that's fine for our purposes. If everyone is negative, we can act as if nobody is infected, because the test is pretty good at finding negatives. However, the moment we find a few transmissions, we know we may have a super-spreader event, and we can tell all 20 people to assume they are positive and to self-isolate -- if there are one or two transmissions, there are likely more, exactly because of the clustering behavior. Depending on age and other factors, we can test those people individually using PCR tests, which can pinpoint who is infected, or ask them all to wait it out.

Scarpino told me that overdispersion also enhances the utility of other aggregate methods, such as wastewater testing, especially in congregate settings like dorms or nursing homes, allowing us to detect clusters without testing everyone. Wastewater testing also has low sensitivity; it may miss positives if too few people are infected, but that's fine for population-screening purposes. If the wastewater testing is signaling that there are likely no infections, we do not need to test everyone to find every last potential case. However, the moment we see signs of a cluster, we can rapidly isolate everyone, again while awaiting further individualized testing via PCR tests, depending on the situation.

To return to the mysteries of this pandemic, what did happen early on to cause such drastically different trajectories in otherwise similar places? There may not be an explanation beyond that the worst-hit regions, at least initially, simply had a few unlucky early super-spreading events. It wasn't just pure luck: Dense populations, older citizens, and congregate living, for example, made cities around the world more susceptible to outbreaks compared with rural, less dense places and those with younger populations, less mass transit, or healthier citizenry. But why Daegu in February [2020] and not Seoul, despite the 2 cities being in the same country, under the same government, people, weather, and more? As frustrating as it may be, sometimes, the answer is merely where Patient 31 and the megachurch she attended happened to be.

Overdispersion makes it harder for us to absorb lessons from the world because it interferes with how we ordinarily think about cause and effect.

Once we recognize super-spreading as a key lever, countries that look as if they were too relaxed in some aspects appear very different, and our usual polarized debates about the pandemic are scrambled, too.

Although overdispersion makes some usual methods of studying causal connections harder, we can study failures to understand which conditions turn bad luck into catastrophes. We can also study sustained success because bad luck will eventually hit everyone and the response matters.

Once a country has too many outbreaks, it's almost as if the pandemic switches into "flu mode," as Scarpino put it, meaning high, sustained levels of community spread even though a majority of infected people may not be transmitting onward. Scarpino explained that barring truly drastic measures, once in that widespread and elevated mode, COVID-19 can keep spreading because of the sheer number of chains already out there. Plus, the overwhelming numbers may eventually spark more clusters, further worsening the situation.

As Kucharski put it, a relatively quiet period can hide how quickly things can tip over into large outbreaks and how a few chained amplification events can rapidly turn a seemingly under-control situation into a disaster. We're often told that if Rt, the real-time measurement of the average spread, is above one, the pandemic is growing, and that below one, it's dying out. That may be true for an epidemic that is not overdispersed, and while an Rt below one is certainly good, it's misleading to take too much comfort from a low Rt when just a few events can reignite massive numbers. No country should forget South Korea's Patient 31.

That said, overdispersion is also a cause for hope, as South Korea's aggressive and successful response to that outbreak -- with a massive testing, tracing, and isolating regime -- shows. Since then, South Korea has also been practicing sustained vigilance and has demonstrated the importance of backward tracing. When a series of clusters linked to nightclubs broke out in Seoul recently, health authorities aggressively traced and tested tens of thousands of people linked to the venues, regardless of their interactions with the index case, 6 feet apart or not -- a sensible response, given that we know the pathogen is airborne.

Perhaps one of the most interesting cases has been Japan, a country with middling luck that got hit early on and followed what appeared to be an unconventional model, not deploying mass testing and never fully shutting down. By the end of March [2020], influential economists were publishing reports with dire warnings, predicting overloads in the hospital system, and huge spikes in deaths. The predicted catastrophe never came to be, however, and although the country faced some future waves, there was never a large spike in deaths despite its aging population, uninterrupted use of mass transportation, dense cities, and lack of a formal lockdown.

Oshitani told me that in Japan, they had noticed the overdispersion characteristics of COVID-19 as early as February [2020], and thus created a strategy focusing mostly on cluster-busting, which tries to prevent one cluster from igniting another. Oshitani said he believes that "the chain of transmission cannot be sustained without a chain of clusters or a mega cluster." Japan thus carried out a cluster-busting approach, including undertaking aggressive backward tracing to uncover clusters. Japan also focused on ventilation, counseling its population to avoid places where the 3 C's come together -- crowds in closed spaces in close contact, especially if there's talking or singing -- bringing together the science of overdispersion with the recognition of airborne aerosol transmission, as well as presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission.

Could we get back to a much more normal life by focusing on limiting the conditions for super-spreading events, aggressively engaging in cluster-busting, and deploying cheap, rapid mass tests -- that is, once we get our case numbers down to low enough numbers to carry out such a strategy? (Many places with low community transmission could start immediately.) Once we look for and see the forest, it becomes easier to find our way out.

[Our thanks to Roland Hübner for sharing this excellent article. It is nice when one's gut feelings are shared by others who have the analytic powers to test it. I have been uncomfortable with the heavy reliance on the R0 from early on, as the other cousins in the coronavirus family (SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV) were also observed to have super-spreading events which were responsible for the majority of cases. The article above does an excellent job of walking one through the logic of the "cluster busting" strategy, doing backward tracing of infected individuals to identify who transmitted it to them and thereby had a high likelihood of having infected many others in a super-spreading event. South Korea seems to be a model country employing this strategy with apparent success, having periodic flare-ups lasting several weeks, identifying all of the clusters, and increased case finding. Can we learn from these successes or will we remain frozen in one way of looking at the outbreaks? - Mod.MPP]

Today's report from the Eastern Mediterranean has the majority of countries not reporting any new cases in the past 24 hours. Europe is experiencing resurgences in many countries related to loosening restrictions and the summer vacation period. The Americas continue to have more countries reporting cases. Major transmission is also ongoing in South East Asia, specifically India, but other countries are following suit. - Cases are increasing in Nepal and Myanmar.

[The USA, India, and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India in the 2nd position followed by Brazil. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (83 801), followed by the USA (47 389) and Brazil (35 643) -- account for over half (54.3%) of all confirmed cases globally and 50.4% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. As the daily reports from each of the 3 countries have been dropping, other countries are reporting more newly confirmed cases. A global total of 8922 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (1-2 Oct 2020).

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (12 countries) include India, USA, Brazil, Argentina (14 001), France (13 970), Israel (10 277), Spain (9419), Russia (8945), UK (6914), Colombia (5660), the Czech Republic (5336), and Mexico (5099); 42 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours. 14 of the 42 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region and 13 were from the Americas region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase in case counts by 0.36%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 7.1%.

Impression: While the global 7-day averages appear to have plateaued, when one looks at the country-by-country figures, the 3 major countries -- the USA, India, and Brazil -- have decreased their daily newly confirmed cases, but other countries have increased transmission, especially in Europe and elsewhere in the Americas. - Mod.MPP]
