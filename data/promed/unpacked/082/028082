OIE scientists review knowledge on Schmallenberg virus
------------------------------------------------------
Following the emergence of Schmallenberg virus [SBV] in Western Europe, the OIE convened a meeting of experts to review existing knowledge of the new virus and provide information to its members and to stakeholders. The conclusions of the meeting have been submitted to the OIE Scientific Commission for Animal Diseases (SCAD) for discussion and endorsement.

The SBV is at the origin of an emerging animal disease that has been found in several Western European countries since the 2nd half of 2011. Identified hosts so far are cattle, sheep, goats, and bison.

Based on current available information, experts concluded that the risk for human health is negligible. The experts also determined that the viraemic period (the time during which the virus circulates in the bloodstream of an infected animal) of SBV is short and that virus transmission most likely occurs by vectors such as mosquitoes or biting midges, with apparent similarity to the transmission of the bluetongue virus.

The experts identified areas of priority for research and collection of scientific data, which will assist the development of appropriate prevention and control methods of the disease. The experts also assessed the risk of the possible spread of the disease through trade. They concluded that the risk of disease spread from trade in meat and milk is negligible. For semen, embryos, and live animals the experts made recommendations for safe trade.

Although information is still limited and more evidence will become available in coming months, the experts collated all up-to-date scientific knowledge of SBV in a new OIE Technical Factsheet that includes epidemiology, guidance on diagnosis, and preliminary advice on prevention and control methods, and the recommendations for safe trade. [see items 2 and 3 below].

The OIE will continue to collect available epidemiological and scientific information and regularly update guidance to its members and the public on this emerging disease.

Background
----------
Schmallenberg virus was first officially characterised in November 2011 in Germany from samples collected in summer/autumn 2011 from diseased dairy cattle. It was also initially detected in dairy cows and in newborn lambs in the Netherlands where the presence of the virus was confirmed in Dec 2011.

In February 2012, the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, the United Kingdom, and France have reported SBV outbreaks to the OIE as an emerging disease.

Schmallenberg virus: technical factsheet
----------------------------------------
[The 4-page OIE technical factsheet on SBV includes 5 chapters: Aetiology, Epidemiology, Diagnosis, Prevention & Control, References.
For subscribers' convenience we present here the chapter "Epidemiology"; subscribers are encouraged to read the other useful chapters at the URL above. - Mod.AS]

SBV epidemiology
----------------
According to the epidemiological investigations, reinforced by what is already known about the genetically related Simbu serogroup viruses, SBV affects domestic ruminants. It is unlikely to be zoonotic. The spatial and temporal distribution suggests that the disease is first transmitted by insect vectors and then vertically in utero.
1. Hosts
a. Cattle, sheep, goats
b. Bison
c. No information on the susceptibly of exotic ruminants (camelids, llamas, etc), or other wild ruminants, or on other species. It is worth noting that other viruses of the Simbu serogroup affect wild ruminants and that antibodies to Akabane virus have been found in horses, donkeys, buffalo, deer, camels, and even in pigs. Some viruses of the Simbu serogroup (Mermet, Peaton, and Oropouche viruses) have also been detected in birds.
Mice and hamsters can be infected experimentally.
d. Humans: no human disease related to SBV has been reported in the affected zone so far, and the genetically most related Orthobunyaviruses do not cause disease in humans. Thus current risk assessments conclude that the virus is unlikely to cause disease in humans even if it cannot be fully excluded at this stage. Nevertheless, close collaboration between public health and animal health services is recommended for the early detection of potential human cases, particularly in farmers and veterinarians in close contact with potentially infected animals, and especially during interventions for dystocia.

2. Transmission
The transmission of SBV needs to be confirmed but hypotheses have been developed through recent epidemiological investigations and comparison with other Orthobunyaviruses:
a. It is likely to be transmitted via insect vectors (biting midges and/or mosquitoes)
b. Vertical transmission across placenta is proven
c. Direct contamination from animal to animal or animal to human is very unlikely but needs further investigation (1st experiments have been started).

Further research is still needed to confirm these transmission routes and to determine the competent insect species.

3. Viraemia and incubation period
Experimental infection in 3 calves showed mild clinical signs of acute infection at 3 to 5 days post-inoculation and viraemia at 2 to 5 days post-inoculation. No data are available for sheep and goats up to February 2012.

4. Sources of virus
- Source of transmission: likely to be infected insect vectors.
- Material found to be positive in virus isolation (up to February 2012): virus has been isolated from blood from affected adults and infected foetus and brain from infected foetus. [see comment below]
Material found PCR positive (up to February 2012): organs and blood of infected foetuses, placenta, amniotic fluid, meconium.
All these findings have to be further investigated for their role in transmission.

5. Occurrence
Only some Orthobunyaviruses had been reported in Europe, such as, Tahyna virus from the California serogroup, but viruses from the Simbu serogroup had never been isolated in Europe before.

1st phase: SBV was first detected in November 2011 in Germany from samples collected in summer/autumn 2011 from diseased (fever, reduced milk yield) dairy cattle. Similar clinical signs (including diarrhoea) were detected in dairy cows in the Netherlands where the presence of SBV was also confirmed in December 2011.

2nd phase: in early December 2011, congenital malformations were reported in newborn lambs in the Netherlands, and SBV was detected in and isolated from the brain tissue [see comment below]. Up to February 2012, Belgium, Germany, United Kingdom, and France have reported stillbirth and congenital malformations with PCR positive results.

For more recent, detailed information on the occurrence of this disease worldwide, see the OIE World Animal Health Information Database (WAHID) interface [http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=home].

[It would be helpful to obtain further information on the apparent isolation of the virus from foeti/brain tissue during the 2nd phase of the SBV event (starting early December 2011), as apparently stated in the information from the Netherlands. Earlier reports referred to the isolation of the virus from clinically affected cattle (in Germany), prior to December 2011.

Schmallenberg virus: recommendations for safe trade
---------------------------------------------------
(as endorsed by the OIE Scientific Commission for Animal Diseases on 16 Feb 2012; will be updated when relevant)

1. Meat:
- Relevant knowledge: only clinically healthy animals are slaughtered. The viraemic period is very short. Transmission of the virus is most likely by vectors.
- Risk of transmission to humans and animals: negligible

2. Milk:
- Relevant knowledge: milk is only collected from clinically healthy animals. The viraemic period is very short. Transmission of the virus is most likely by vectors.
- Risk of transmission to humans and animals: negligible

3. Semen:
- Relevant knowledge: the viraemic period is very short. Semen is collected from clinically healthy animals. From 8 bulls experimentally infected with Akabane virus, virus was not found in semen even during the viraemic period (Parsonson IM, Della-Porta AJ, Snowdon WA, O'Halloran ML. Experimental infection of bulls with Akabane virus. Res Vet Sci. 1981; 31(2): 157-60 [abstract available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6798655]). From other vectorborne diseases like bluetongue, it is known that transmission through semen, collected from viraemic animals, is possible.
- Risk of transmission to animals: negligible for seronegative bulls. Further experiments are needed.
- Recommendation: according to the current knowledge, the risk is probably lower than the risk for bluetongue and the recommendation similar to the one for bluetongue should therefore provide sufficient assurance of safety for semen, taking into consideration a much shorter infective period of Schmallenberg virus. [OIE's recommendation for the veterinary requirements for the importation of semen of ruminants and other susceptible herbivores from BTV infected countries or zones are laid out in article 8.3.8 of the chapter at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.8.3.htm. - Mod.AS]

4. Embryos:
- Relevant knowledge: the viraemic period is very short. Embryos are collected from clinically healthy animals. Akabane virus is classified under the category 4 (diseases or pathogenic agents for which studies have been done or are in progress that indicate that either no conclusions are yet possible with regard to the level of transmission risk; or the risk of transmission via embryo transfer might not be negligible even if the embryos are properly handled between collection and transfer). Schmallenberg virus is known to have a tropism for embryos and foetuses.
- Recommendation: according to its virology, safety measures applicable to Akabane virus should be followed. With further research, the measures should be reviewed and specified.
- Risk of transmission: according to the current knowledge, the risk from seronegative donor animals is negligible. These animals should stay seronegative 21 days after the collection.
Seropositive and PCR-negative donor animals at the day of insemination should be also considered with negligible risk.

5. Live adult non pregnant animals:
- Relevant knowledge: the viraemic period is very short. Mild clinical signs might occur. Transmission is most likely by vectors.
- Recommendation: the measures taken should be similar to those for bluetongue, taking into consideration a much shorter infective period.
- Risk of transmission: negligible for the following animals according to the current knowledge related to the limited data available. All measures are aimed to allow a reasonable but high safety margin. All measures have to be carefully reviewed when more data will be available.
a. Seronegative twice in quarantine (within 28 days) or,
b. Seropositive twice with an interval of 14 days or,
c. PCR negative after 7 days in a vector-free environment or,
d. Seropositive and PCR negative.

6. Live pregnant animals:
- Relevant knowledge: the virus can persist in the foetus; this can result in the birth of virus positive calves, lambs, and kids. Some pre-colostral calves are seropositive. The vectors are unknown yet and the relevant pregnancy time to induce viraemic newborns is not exactly known.
- Risk of transmission:
a. Negligible for the offspring of seronegative animals tested twice in quarantine (within 28 days),
b. Negligible for the offspring of animals seropositive before insemination,
c. Undetermined for the offspring of all animals not covered by the previous bullets.
- Recommendation: it is urgently needed to collect more data about the relevant infection periods inducing viraemic newborn.

7. Live newborns:
- Relevant knowledge: to the available knowledge, no viraemic healthy newborn was reported, all viraemic live newborns were malformed or had health problems.
- Risk of transmission: to the available knowledge, the risk of transmission from healthy newborns is hypothetic.
- Recommendation: a study to evaluate the potential existence of viraemic healthy newborn is needed.

[Since certification for international trade, as described in the recommendations above, is partly based upon serological tests, it is appropriate to present here the passage "Laboratory diagnosis" from the chapter "diagnosis" in OIE's new technical factsheet on SBV.

"1. Samples:
a. From live animals for the detection of acute infection:
- EDTA blood;
- Serum (at least 2 ml, transported cooled).
b. From stillborns and malformed calves, lambs and kids:
- From necropsy: tissue samples of brain (cerebrum and cerebellum), additional samples: central nervous system, spleen and blood
- From live newborn: blood, (preferably pre-colostral) serum, and meconium (Samples should be transported cooled or frozen).
- Placenta and amniotic fluids.
2. Procedures:
a. Identification of the agent
- Real-time RT-PCR
- Cell culture isolation of the virus
b. Serological tests on serum samples
- Indirect immunofluorescence
- Neutralization test
- ELISA to be developed."

OIE is commendable for convening the expert ad-hoc group and the issuance of the recommendations and the technical factsheet, despite the fact that (the emerging) SBV is not included (yet?) in OIE's list of notifiable diseases. Subscribers may be reminded that Akabane virus, to which reference is made in the documents above, is also not an OIE listed disease.

Several countries have already applied restrictions on the import of animals, particularly genetic material from ruminants from the SBV affected countries or from Europe. The recommendations will, hopefully, provide assistance in their risk assessment. - Mod.AS
