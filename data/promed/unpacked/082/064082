Officials in a Cambodian province close to the capital said Wednesday
[13 Jun 2007], that 7 children had died of dengue fever in one
village in recent weeks and they were bracing for more deaths as the
rainy season set in. Meng Sothy, deputy director of Kampong Speu
[Spoe] district hospital, 40 km (25 mi) southwest of the capital,
said the 7, whose ages were not given, had all come from the remote
Borset village and had died despite being transferred to children's
hospitals in Phnom Penh. "We have 7 children dead so far, but these
are just the ones who have been reported and we have no idea how many
have contracted the disease," he said.
He said officials were mounting an education campaign to try to
educate villagers on how to contain the mosquito-borne virus, which
kills mostly the very young and the elderly, and whose symptoms
include high fever and intense muscle and joint pain. The virus often
kills by destroying blood platelets, resulting in massive
hemorrhaging.
Kampong Speu hospital director, Huot Thorn, said the disease was a
sad fact of life for rural Cambodians, especially during the monsoon
season when the mosquitoes breed prolifically.
On Wednesday [13 Jun 2007], Dr Beat Richner, a Swiss national who
runs 4 Kantha Bopha hospitals in Cambodia, which provide free health
care to children, placed a full-page advertisement in the
English-language Cambodia Daily newspaper, calling dengue fever "an
epidemic." Richner said his hospitals had treated 1254 cases of
severe dengue fever in children in the 1st week of June [2007] alone
and appealed to the Cambodian government and international donors for
aid to assist his hospitals to cope with the problem.

[3] Taiwan ex Viet Nam, Indonesia, Thailand

Of a group of 5 people who traveled to Viet Nam earlier this month
[June 2007] to broker a marriage between a Taiwanese man and a
Vietnamese woman, 4 were confirmed to have been infected with dengue
fever, the Department of Health (DOH) said on Friday [15 Jun 2007].
Last Tuesday [12 Jun 2007], health officials said that the group was
from Chiayi County and that a 50-year-old man was reported to have
been infected.
Health officials later found that a young man and his mother, both
friends of the 50-year-old, and a Taiwanese man and his Vietnamese
wife who were trying to introduce a Vietnamese woman to the young
man, had developed the symptoms for dengue fever -- a high fever,
aching bones, and headaches. Further tests found that 3 of them had
been infected, while the other was still being tested.
Nantou County also reported a case of dengue hemorrhagic fever a day
earlier. The patient, a 6-year-old girl who went with her mother to
Viet Nam between 10 May and 7 June [2007], developed a fever the day
she returned to Taiwan, although she was not diagnosed at the time.
Her high fever persisted and she also developed a rash on her face and
body, prompting a hospital to report her as being infected with
hemorrhagic dengue fever. [A rash is common with uncomplicated dengue,
and does not indicate DHF. - Mod.JW]
Lin Ting, deputy director of the DOH's Center for Disease Control,
said that there have been 36 imported dengue fever cases so far this
year [2007], 22 of which were caught in Indonesia, followed by 9
cases from Viet Nam, and 3 from Thailand.
With the continuous rain in recent days, he also urged the public to
remove any standing water from close to their homes in the hope of
reducing the breeding areas for mosquitoes and preventing an outbreak
of indigenous dengue fever.

It should be noted that Taiwan is not a dengue free country.
According to the Taiwan CDC website (<http://www.cdc.gov.tw/en/>), in
2006 there were more than 900 reported cases of indigenous dengue
reported in the country. The importance of importations is that they
may contribute to changing serotype prevalence in the country, but are
not at this point in time responsible for the bulk of cases reported
in the country. - Mod.MPP]

the more deadly dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF] can be found in
