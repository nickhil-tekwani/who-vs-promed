The total number of cases is now 33, with 31 cutaneous cases and 2 deaths
from systemic anthrax (one through self-medication and late recognition;
the second was also recognised too late). 27/33 participated in the illegal
slaughter of sick animals without veterinary supervision; 5 men had contact
with infected meat. Some 300 contact persons were investigated and were
found to be unaffected. All the infected meat that could be traced was
burnt. The animal slaughter sites were disinfected. All related stock was
checked and quarantined.

In 8 foci [outbreaks the livestock vaccination rates was found to be less
than optimum at only 50-72 percent. The vaccination had been started late
and then stretched out through June to August. Also the cold chain was
broken and in summer the ambient temperature is over 40 C. [The Kazakh
livestock vaccine like others is a live vaccine.

This series of outbreaks is a direct effect of the current economic
difficulties in the country and these impact most severely on the rural
population.
