Indonesia fears dengue epidemic in Jakarta, 5 other provinces
-----------------------------------------------
Indonesia's capital Jakarta and 5 provinces have been placed under
alert for a possible dengue epidemic, following a growing number of
fatalities and infections, officials said. Health authorities said
efforts were being stepped up to prevent a repeat of last year's
[2004] dengue fever outbreak that killed 669 people and infected 59
321 others in 24 of the country's 32 provinces.
"Jakarta has been declared on alert against an extraordinary
occurrence of dengue fever," Aida Fatmi, a doctor at Jakarta's health
office, told AFP.
Health Minister Siti Fadilah Supari was quoted by the Jakarta Post as
saying 5 other provinces, East Java, East Kalimantan, South Sulawesi,
West Nusa Tenggara and East Nusa Tenggara, were also under dengue
watch.
The mosquito-borne disease has led to 102 fatalities so far this year
[2005] in the 6 provinces, with 4700 infections, she said.
No outbreak has been reported in the tsunami-battered province of
Aceh, where more than 240 000 people have died or are missing,
despite earlier concerns by relief agencies of health threats posed
by malaria and dengue.

Dengue fever alert in Asia
-------------------------
Travelers to Asia are being warned about a possible epidemic of
potentially fatal dengue fever, following serious outbreaks in
Malaysia and Singapore.
Malaysia recorded 13 deaths from the mosquito-borne disease in
January [2005] alone, 3 times the monthly average. The number of
confirmed cases also rose alarmingly, with 1387 reported during the
past 4 weeks. The capital, Kuala Lumpur, is one of the worst-affected
places, with the number of sufferers rising from 176 2 weeks ago to
336 last week [final week of January 2005].
Meanwhile, Singapore is experiencing its most serious outbreak of the
condition for more than 10 years. Only 4450 people fell ill with
dengue fever during the whole of 2003, yet 1145 were diagnosed last
month [January 2005] alone. Both countries have launched public
awareness campaigns, and Singapore's authorities are issuing fines to
any resident who allows mosquitoes to breed on their property.

4 dengue fever cases confirmed in Makkah
---------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health has confirmed the presence of 4 cases of
dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) in Makkah. "The cases have been
recorded during the last month [January 2005], and they have received
treatment," said Dr. Khaled Merghalani, a spokesman for the Ministry
of Health.
Because of recent heavy rains, there are many stagnant pools that
provide breeding areas for the mosquitoes which spread the fever.
"The health and infection control teams have been busy spraying the
pools," said a source in Makkah.
Dr. Ghazi Shaikh, director of preventive health care and first aid at
the health affairs office in Jeddah, said that no cases of dengue
fever had been reported in Jeddah. But Dr. Merghalani said it was
possible that dengue fever cases would appear there. "It's important
to raise people's awareness about how they can reduce the spread of
the mosquitoes by spraying their homes and not leaving any pools or
water uncovered or allowing water to collect," he explained. Jeddah
is full of stagnant water pools, overflowing septic tanks, leaking
water pipes, and inadequate, if not non-existent, drainage. All of
these encourage the breeding of mosquitoes. A source at the Jeddah
Municipality said that 90 percent of the underground water table had
been reduced in some neighborhoods.

Dengue fever hits record highs in Singapore [2004]
-----------------------------------------------
Singapore last year [2004] experienced its worst outbreak of dengue
fever in a decade, with the number of cases in the final 3 months
tripling, compared with the same period in 2003.
The number of dengue cases between October and December [2004] rose
to 3340, and the problem has crossed over into 2005, with 1145 cases
reported last month [January 2005], a spokesperson from the National
Environment Agency said on Friday [4 Feb 2005].
For all of 2004, Singapore recorded 9459 cases of dengue, almost
double the number in 2003. The National Environment Agency did not
provide figures on how many people had died in Singapore from dengue.
However, the government said in December [2004] that 3 people had
died in 2004 from the virus.
Private homes were the main breeding grounds of mosquitoes,
accounting for almost 90 percent of all breedings found last month
[January 2005], said the spokesperson. Most Singaporeans live in
apartment buildings, but many families keep potted plants in which
mosquitoes can breed. The government this month launched a crackdown
in which homeowners found with mosquitoes breeding on their premises
would be fined instantly. Penalties for construction sites are much
stiffer and can include up to 6 months in jail for those responsible.
The World Health Organization says the global prevalence of dengue
has grown dramatically in recent decades, and the disease is now
endemic in more than 100 countries.

As of 1 Feb 2005, WHO has received reports of 95 cases of dengue
infection and 11 deaths (case fatality ratio, 11.6 percent). Out of
the 95 cases, 61 had clinical features compatible with dengue
hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and 34 were diagnosed as suspected dengue
fever (DF) using WHO standard case definitions.
Districts reporting DF/DHF cases are Baucau, Dili, Liquica, Maliana
and Manatuto (see previous report) with 89.9 percent of the cases
reported from Dili [the capital].
The Ministry of Health, with the assistance of WHO, is organizing a
seminar for case management of dengue and DHF for clinicians and
nurses. WHO is providing support to the Dili National Hospital in the
management of dengue and DHF and in targeting interventions in
high-risk areas. Other control activities include assistance with
vector control and health promotion.
