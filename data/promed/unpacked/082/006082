Rio has 3 more cases of suspected yellow fever (YF), according to the
Municipal Health Secretariat. They are: a 43-year-old resident of
Ipanema, who caught it in Amazonia; a 30-year-old resident of Campo
Grande, who spent New Year's Eve in Goiania [Goias state; & a 47-
year-old male resident of Para State, who came to visit his family in the
district of Meier, in the north of the city of Rio de Janeiro, & who has
been in the University Hospital of Rio since last Saturday.
Blood specimens from the patients have been sent to the Institute
Oswaldo Cruz & the results will be available on Wed 19 Jan. "If the
results are positive, we will see, along with the Ministry of Health, what
needs to be done," said Meri Baran, epidemiology coordinator of the
Secretariat, which continues to not recommend mass vaccination. "We
will immunize only those travelling to endemic areas," he explains.
The only case of YF so far confirmed in Rio was a student who became
infected during a visit to Chapada dos Veadeiros, in Goias state. The 24-
year-old girl has completely recovered. Residents of Itanhanga, where
she lives, have already been vaccinated. "Our greatest concern is to
control the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, the vector of dengue & yellow
fever. To do this, the Secretariat has contracted 350 professionals, who
will sweep through the whole city," says Meri.
**************
Already in the year 2000, Brazil has had 4 deaths from yellow fever, 7
confirmed & 5 suspect cases.

[If one case has already been confirmed, there could well be more
infected residents of Rio now returning home from vacation in the interior
of
Brazil. Brazil has enough vaccine available for mass vaccination of Rio
de Janeiro. It might be prudent to do it now before more cases are
hospitalized in the city. The University Hospital of Rio does not have
mosquito screens on the windows. - Mod.JW
