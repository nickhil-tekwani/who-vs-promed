Cow killed after it contracts rabies
-----------------------------------
A 2nd domestic animal in LaSalle County has been euthanized after
contracting a form of rabies carried by skunks. This comes about one month
after the 1st case, which was the 1st domestic animal to contract the
disease since a cow was diagnosed in 1995.
Because of the proximity of the animals, state officials are concerned
"there may be an elevated level of rabies in that part of LaSalle County
and neighboring counties," said Jeff Squibb, a spokesman for the Illinois
Department of Agriculture.
A cow in the western part of LaSalle County was killed 13 Jan 2005 because
of a confirmed case of rabies, said Jennifer Williams, a public health
department spokeswoman. Also, 7 people have received rabies preventative
treatment after being exposed to the cow.
A horse in LaSalle County was also diagnosed with rabies 10 Dec 2005, after
it contracted a type genetically unique to skunks, Squibb said. 11 people
received preventative treatment after being in contact with the horse. The
horse was the 1st confirmed case of a mammal, other than a bat, having
rabies in Illinois since a 1998 case of a skunk in Livingston County,
Squibb said.
The last confirmed case of a horse contracting rabies was in 1988, Squibb
said. "It's really unusual, so of course there is some concern connected to
this," Williams said. "We don't want to scare people. We want people to be
aware."
The public health and agriculture departments are increasing surveillance
of skunks and asking the public to be careful around wild animals, Squibb
said. Changes in behavior are not limited to animals foaming at the mouth
or becoming aggressive, Squibb said. One sign is an infected skunk, a
nocturnal animal, being out during the day.
Rabies, an infectious viral disease that affects the nervous system of
mammals, is primarily spread by bats in Illinois and is almost always
fatal, Squibb said. Livestock typically do not receive rabies vaccinations,
but farmers are advised to consult their veterinarian about that option
with valuable livestock, Squibb said.
