Dozens of children in Fayoum Governorate have contracted an unknown
viral disease [with] symptoms similar to that of the common cold.
They have been detained in [local] hospitals. The General Hospital of
Fayoum Governorate has notified the Department of Health in Fayoum
Youm7 [newspaper], quoting an official source at Fayoum's Health
Department, reported that dozens of children in Fayoum Governorate
have contracted an illness with common cold-like symptoms. They are
not responding to treatment including several days of nutritional
care in hospital.

The official source added that this new type of virus has not been
identified, and reported that hospitals in different parts of the
province have admitted 30-40 children daily who are suffering from
this so far undiagnosed disease. More than 200 children are now under
treatment.

The Directorate of Health in Fayoum is being urged to take action and
declare an emergency situation in anticipation of the increasing
number of children affected by this disease.

[The illness affecting these Egyptian children (ages not specified)
is assumed to be caused by a viral infection, but no evidence is
advanced to support this inference. The symptoms appear to be common
cold-like, but more prolonged. A particularly virulent strain of
rhinovirus (common cold virus) might be responsible, but there are
many other viruses associated with upper respiratory tract infections
in both children and adults. Recently in Egypt 2 adults have been
diagnosed with avian influenza virus infection; however this virus is
associated with more severe respiratory disease and has rarely been
transmissible from human to human. Further information is awaited.
