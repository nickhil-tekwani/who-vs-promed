Animal health and welfare aspects of avian influenza and the risk of its
introduction into the EU poultry holdings: summary

Scientific opinion of the Panel on Animal Health and Welfare (AHAW)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Following a request from the Commission, the AHAW panel was asked to
deliver a scientific opinion on the animal health and welfare aspects of
avian influenza and the risk of its introduction into the EU poultry holdings.

More in particular, the Commission asked to update, consolidate, and
summarise the main conclusions and recommendations from previous EFSA
opinions influenza (2005, 2006a, 2006b, 2007a and 2007b) in the light of
new scientific evidence available. Further, the AHAW panel was asked to
provide scientific advice and assess risk factors for the introduction and
spread of avian influenza as defined in Council Directive 2005/94/EC into
poultry holdings in the EU, to support a possible fine-tuning of current
prevention and biosecurity measures taken by the Member States.

New findings on AIV [avian influenza virus] characteristics
-----------------------------------------------------------
Phylogenetic analyses of strains from EU Member States indicated that all
H5N1 viruses detected in the EU in poultry and wild birds since 2006 were
closely related and belong to clades 2.2 and 2.3. The use of phylogeny can
advise on the source of infection, but it is not possible in all
circumstances to be definitive about the likely source of an introduction.

Pathogenesis and transmission
-----------------------------
Concerning the pathogenesis and the transmission of AIV, the main
conclusions were that although fecal-oral infection chains govern the
transmission of AIV, accumulating evidence indicates that H5N1 virus may be
excreted at higher concentrations from the respiratory tract of birds as
compared to LPAI [low pathogenic avian influenza] viruses. This has
important consequences for sampling methodologies to detect HPAI [highly
pathogenic avian influenza] H5N1. Although there is no evidence for aerosol
transmission of H5N1 virus, this transmission route cannot be excluded
within short distances.

Many, if not all, poultry species are susceptible to infection by AI
viruses of the different subtypes, but only H5 and H7 subtypes are able to
induce HPAI. H5N1 of the Asian lineage remains able to cause significant
mortality in wild bird populations, although experimental studies show that
some species can become infected without clinical manifestations, shedding
virus whilst apparently healthy. Indirect evidence also points to some mild
clinical effects of LPAIV in wild bird species.

Several domestic animals, including pigs, cats, and dogs are susceptible to
H5N1 HPAI viruses under natural and experimental conditions. H5N1 failed to
spread between mammal species, which makes the chance for virus
transmission to humans extremely low. For cats, though, it has been
suggested that spread between cats and from cats to poultry may occur. It
remains to be examined whether the viral genetic changes that are required
for adaptation of AI viruses to pigs or other mammals occur more readily in
some animal species than in others.

Diagnosis
---------
Viral isolation in embryonated eggs still remains the "gold standard" for
AI virus detection. Although it is slower, its diagnostic sensitivity is
often superior or equal to many rapid tests.

Virus genome detection by RT-PCR [reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction], which can be designed to detect all avian influenza A viruses or
specific subtypes, provides a rapid, sensitive, and convenient alternative
for virus isolation. Any of the influenza A commercial rapid tests can
detect the influenza viruses, but it should be emphasized that their
specificity and sensitivity are limited for their application.

The currently available serological tests are not all able to distinguish
between sublineages or HP and LP strains. Furthermore, positive serological
findings give no indication of current infection status. Competition tests
are polyvalent and may be of use for obtaining broad estimate of infection
levels in wild bird populations.

Epidemiology and surveillance
-----------------------------
Enhanced surveillance both in poultry and wild birds in the EU during 2006
to 2008 proved effective for the early detection of H5N1 HPAI. Passive
surveillance proved to be important for the detection of H5N1 HPAI
infections in wild birds. In contrast active surveillance proved a better
surveillance source to detect LPAI infections. Active surveillance remains
an important source of epidemiological information of H5N1, especially
around sites with active outbreaks. Due to the heterogeneity of the survey
in the EU, the mobility of wild birds, and the relatively small sample
sizes compared to the overall population of wild birds in the EU, the
surveillance results can not be used to estimate the true prevalence of AIV
subtypes or their geographical distribution within the EU.

Current knowledge on EU outbreaks does not allow prediction of a risk
season for H5N1 HPAI outbreak occurrence in the EU. Fewer H7 positive
holdings than H5 and fewer duck and geese holdings positive for H7 than for
H5 were found during the 2006-2007 survey. However due to the small sample
sizes and the design of the surveillance strategy with varying degrees of
targeting to risk factors, it is not possible to precisely estimate the
actual prevalence of avian influenza of H5 and H7 subtypes in holdings of
domestic poultry.

Intervention strategies
-----------------------
Biosecurity measures constitute important barriers to introduction of AIV
into poultry holdings. Culling and safe disposal of poultry from infected
holdings (as defined by 2005/94/EC) is one of the most effective measures
limiting spread of virus. Pre-emptive culling of healthy poultry on
holdings where AI is not thought to be present may be necessary to limit
AIV spread in order to remove susceptible birds from the immediate vicinity.

Potent subtype-restricted and safe AIV vaccines are available for use in
poultry. Quality-controlled production and licensing procedures are
essential to ensure vaccine efficacy. Vaccination induces protection
against HPAIV induced clinical signs; it raises the barrier against
infection with HPAIV field virus and reduces field virus excretion by
amplitude and duration.

The risk of "silent spread" of AIV in vaccinated poultry populations
requires stringent supervision and control of vaccination, including the
application of DIVA [Differentiating between Infected and Vaccinated
Animals] strategies campaigns. Decisions on the use of vaccination depend
on economical and structural aspects of the poultry sector and on
epidemiological factors concerning risks of virus introduction and spread.
Exit strategies from vaccination campaigns should be clearly defined before
such campaigns commence and unrestricted use of AIV vaccines in poultry may
give rise to an accelerated antigenic drift of field virus targets. In turn
constant updates of vaccine virus strains may be required.

Risk of introduction of avian influenza by wild birds
-----------------------------------------------------
Wild birds have been implicated in the geographical expansion of highly
pathogenic avian influenza virus outbreaks across Asia, the Middle East,
Europe, and Africa. This should be considered in addition to traditional
transmission by infected poultry, contaminated equipment, and people. Such
a role requires excretion of virus in the absence of debilitating disease.

Since the last EFSA opinion on the role of migratory birds for the spread
of HPAI relatively few (21) wild bird species have been the subject of
experimental infection, however, more birds than previously thought might
be involved in the spread of avian influenza through shedding either in
pre-symptomatic infection or in asymptomatic infection.

Given the number of cases of HPAI H5N1 in wild birds observed over the last
2 years, the risk of introduction and release of HPAI by wild birds appears
to be a regular, rather than a very rare or very frequent event and the
constant presence of H5N1 in the wild bird population since 2006 cannot be
excluded.

However, it is still unclear to what extent wild bird species, from which
HPAI has been isolated, act as vectors rather than serving as indicators of
transmission by becoming infected by other vector species. H5N1 virus may
be circulating at an undetectable level in wild bird populations across Europe.

There is a continuing risk of introduction of AI into poultry populations
from infected wild birds that may come into contact directly or indirectly
with domestic poultry. Pathogenic amplification of avian influenza in
domestic birds and subsequent spill-back to wild birds may complement the
synergistic mechanism existing between domestic poultry and wild bird
species responsible for the intercontinental spread of H5N1.

Risks of AI introduction by the importation of live birds and avian
products from 3rd countries
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Infected live poultry are potential agents for introduction of AI
especially when they are in their incubation period of HPAI, infected with
LPAI, or of a species that does not show overt clinical signs (such as
seems to be the case for some duck species). Day old chicks and hatching
eggs are not regarded as a big risk although HPAI infections can not be
entirely excluded.

Pigeons have previously been thought to be relatively resistant to
infection by the virus and therefore regarded as a low risk in the spread
of HPAI H5N1. However, some recent experimental studies have shown that
they are susceptible to infection. It can not be excluded that pigeons act
as mechanical carrier of virus. The sport pigeon racing over large
distances -- from country to country -- plus the procedure of gathering
them together for release represents introduction risks that are unique to
these birds.

Wild captured birds pose a risk of introduction of HPAI. Import and
quarantine provisions for captive birds have been revised and strengthened
and are now restricted to birds bred in captivity from approved breeding
establishments from a limited list of countries. Therefore only illegal
importations would pose a risk.

Importation of fresh meat has the highest risk of introducing of avian
influenza with emphasis on duck meat due to the fact that the disease might
not have been apparent before slaughter.

Eggs for consumption may be infected with avian influenza; however they do
not often come into contact with poultry again. Contaminated packaging
materials and trays pose a far greater risk. Egg or meat products are
usually subjected to a form of heat treatment, which would inactivate the
virus. Semen may be infected after viremia of the donor and a potential
source of infection for HPAI.

Veterinary checks on EU borders
-------------------------------
The check points at the EU borders have been improved over the last years
but there are still many deficiencies. The TRACES [TRAde Control and Expert
System] system is also not fully implemented and therefore does not give
the real time data of movements of live animals. Its active implementation
across the EU is a high priority.

Welfare aspects of avian influenza
----------------------------------
New developments of the welfare issues associated with avian influenza were
discussed, that is, on the killing of poultry for disease control including
the use of dry or high extension rate foams delivering gases that kill by
hypoxia. Other developments are mobile on-farm slaughter plants and whole
house gassing techniques involving different gas mixtures, and also
high-throughput electrocution techniques.

Recent studies show that, where birds are handled by people during
emergency killing, handling often causes much stress and injury. Portable
shackling lines for electrical stunning and killing, using presently
available equipment can fail in that birds are not killed but only stunned.

The gassing of birds in buildings can kill poultry humanely provided that
the building is reasonably sealed to exclude air entry, there is no
functioning ventilation system, the gas jet does not directly contact
birds, the gas is not cold enough to harm body tissue, and the gas is an
inert gas like argon or nitrogen or a gas mixture with no more than 30 per
cent carbon dioxide.

Recent work on carbon monoxide suggests that in addition to being dangerous
for humans, it may cause poor welfare in poultry.

Foams with a low gas to water extension ratio (100-140), such as high
density fire fighting foam, kill by drowning (asphyxiation and hypoxia) and
will often, or perhaps always, result in poor welfare in the birds. Foams
with a high gas to water extension ratio (300 or more) surround the mouth
of the birds with the gas so, if an inert gas such as nitrogen is used, the
birds are stunned humanely and then killed by the gas.

Ducks and geese are rendered unconscious and killed by gases such as CO2
more slowly than chickens or turkeys so that exposure to CO2 gas leads to
poor welfare for a longer time.

Impact of avian influenza on biodiversity
-----------------------------------------
HPAI H5N1 continues to have significant implications for the conservation
of several species of globally threatened waterbirds and may threaten the
survival of endangered felids.

From the little information available there is no indication about a
direct threat of HPAI of poultry genetic diversity, except for localized
genetics. There may be an indirect impact of the HPAI related measures
including restocking and sector restructuring.

[This comprehensive, commendable expert opinion addresses the animal health
aspects of the HPAI H5N1 epizootic. Obviously, it concentrates mainly in
the analysis and assessment of the developments within the European arena,
but also includes valuable opinions on the global evolvement of the
disease. The passage on risk of introduction of avian influenza by wild
birds -- an intensively discussed issue since the start of the current
panzootic -- is of particular interest; for the discussion on this
intriguing subject, subscribers are referred to page 77 of the report.
