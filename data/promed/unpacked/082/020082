Foot and mouth goes virtual
---------------------------
A huge database covering every aspect of the United Kingdom's outbreak of
foot and mouth disease (FMD) in 2001 has been compiled by government
scientists. The electronic record -- accessible on the web -- is intended
for use by researchers worldwide wanting to understand better how diseases
can spread through a nation's livestock herds. It should also inform the
emergency procedures now being established in the UK to prevent an event on
such a scale ever occurring again.
The 29 gigabyte database reveals the daily decisions and commands of
officials charged with tackling the crisis, and the information they passed
to ministers. It even details the results of the individual blood tests on
infected animals and the ear-tag numbers that show the location and
movement of all the UK's cattle at the outset of the epidemic. It can be
interrogated to show which animals were slaughtered and what was done with
their remains, and catalogues the compensation scheme to farmers and the
costs of fighting the outbreak.
"We've compiled what is the biggest database on any FMD epidemic anywhere
in the world and it's probably bigger than any other disease database apart
from our BSE one," said Jim Scudamore, the chief veterinary officer. "It's
an invaluable resource for science, for research, for economic analysis and
for the development of future control strategies." The database is a mass
of charts, tables and maps that describe the development of the outbreak
farm-by-farm, week-by-week. It is fully searchable and cross-referenced.
The Data Protection Act means the more personal details of farmers and
their holdings will only be made available to bona-fide research workers
under agreement. These scientists will have password-protected access to
the privileged data. Epidemiologists, who study patterns of disease
development, will be most keen to get their hands on the information. Two
of the 3 official inquires into the 2001 outbreak called for more research
in their field of expertise.
"The information will enable these researchers to build up extensive models
of the FMD outbreak," Howard Dalton, the chief scientific adviser, said.
"And it's important to stress that although this database relates
specifically to FMD, it could apply to other diseases."
The need for the database was first recognised 3 months into the outbreak
in May 2001. A programme was set in motion to recover and preserve the mass
of smaller databases, spreadsheets, paper records, and electronic documents
held by different government departments and agencies. The Central Science
Laboratory has spent the past 18 months pulling all the information
together and validating it.
"It's a snapshot of what happened," said Jim Scudamore. "We still have much
to learn: why did the disease spread the way it did; why did some farms
become infected while others did not. This database should help us answer
these questions."
The FMD epidemic began on a Northumberland pig farm in February 2001; the
last recorded case was reported in the following September. About 6 million
animals had to be culled because of infection or for welfare reasons. The
cost to agriculture and the food industry has been put at over 3bn BP; the
costs to the tourist and associated industries are thought to have doubled
that figure.

Foot and mouth disease - introduction
-------------------------------------
During the FMD outbreak 2001 the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food
(MAFF), and then its successor the Department for Environment Food and
Rural Affairs (DEFRA), created large volumes of data on every conceivable
element of the outbreak. Mindful of the fact from very early on in April
2001 that the outbreak was going to be of enormous consequence to the UK,
the staff of the Joint Coordination Centre in London decided to make sure
that all possible data sources were captured and protected as the outbreak
progressed. The quality of the data from the early stages of the outbreak
was less than perfect and although much time and effort has been expended
in checking and verifying data and going back to original sources we would
not claim by any means that the data set had been brought to a perfect
state. But, that fact does not deny its value as the most completely
documented major outbreak of animal disease to date. For the first time
ever for a major epidemic we have most of the salient data available in
electronic form. This data set is available to any bona-fide researcher
worldwide who is prepared to observe modest confidentiality conditions.
Some elements of the data have no data protection implications and these
are presented for public consumption. The elements show in graphical form
how the epidemic progressed and regressed and how the numbers of animals
destroyed accumulated on a county by county basis.
In the deeper archive, for the academic researcher, all the data elements
that we collected are accessible and we provide a managed service to make
access to large data sets by means of FTP or CD ROM possible. In making
this data available we meet the stated wish of both the Royal Society
Report and the Lessons Learned Inquiry. Both asked that the data be made
available so that scientists and others charged with managing animal
disease could use the information to advantage in understanding major
epidemics and all the elements that form part of disease control.

[This is a major and most commendable step by a government service. It is
also a unique act but one which will have many long term benefits by
allowing others to learn by the British experience. Obviously, such data
could not become available following the epidemic of FMD in 1967 and 1968,
though data were extracted from the MAFF files at the time and that
survived privately. Unfortunately, MAFF destroyed all their records in the
late 1980s. It seems that the DEFRA records of the 2001 epidemic will be
even more useful and valuable than the ones of the previous epidemic. -
