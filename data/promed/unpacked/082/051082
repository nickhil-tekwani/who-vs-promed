[2] Sierra Leone: quarantine escapees cause case surge
Date: 21 May 2015
Source: News24 [edited]
http://www.news24.com/Africa/News/Sierra-Leone-berates-Ebola-quarantine-escapees-as-cases-surge-20150521


The country's National Ebola Response Centre (NERC) spoke out as the World Health Organisation (WHO) revealed the West African nation and its neighbour Guinea had seen cases quadruple in a week.

Palo Conteh, head of the government-run NERC, told reporters in the capital Freetown a man who went on the run despite being under quarantine was responsible for the enforced isolation of 52 people. "Some of the 52 may be infected because of a selfish and shameful act of a small number of people," he said.

SC escaped a sealed-off section of Freetown's densely-populated Moa Wharf slum after his girlfriend died of Ebola, said the NERC chief, who is no relation. He evaded capture for a week but died in a treatment unit on Sun [17 May 2015], 2 days after being tracked down at another residence in Freetown by expert Ebola contact tracers.

Palo Conteh said health officials had removed 52 people from their building and were monitoring them at an isolation unit on the outskirts of the capital. The group includes the escapee's mother and a nurse who was said to have been massaging him and washing his clothes, despite repeated government warnings that Ebola spreads through physical contact. "You will not survive by running away from quarantine or by caring for the sick in hiding," the NERC chief said. A friend who escaped with SC was eventually rounded up around 160 km to the southeast of Freetown, he added.

The problem is not just restricted to the capital according to the NERC, which said another 5 people had escaped their quarantined home in the northern district of Kambia, near the border with Guinea... The government says 578 patients are in quarantine across the country, most in the Western Area, which includes the capital... - more

[3] Sierra Leone: last survivor of his lab team
Date: 23 May 2015
Source: WHO [edited]
http://www.who.int/features/2015/ebola-health-worker-sesay/en/


M was once part of an 8-person team of laboratory technicians trained to test for Ebola virus. But as the outbreak exploded and more and more samples arrived, his team was overwhelmed. One by one, his colleagues sickened and died. He too eventually fell ill but survived and is the only member of his team left to tell the tale [see his photo at source].

"I just can't remember how I got infected with Ebola," says M, the only survivor in a team of 8 lab technicians working at the Lassa fever laboratory at Kenema Government Hospital, Sierra Leone. M had been working in the hospital's general laboratory when the outbreak started. He volunteered to learn how to test for Ebola in the hospital's Lassa fever laboratory because the explosion of cases in the district meant there was an urgent need for more trained technicians able to test for Ebola.

The Lassa fever laboratory at the Kenema government hospital was the only facility in the country equipped to do tests to detect the Ebola virus. "Together with colleagues from the general hospital, I volunteered to be trained to work in the Lassa fever lab," says M. "Step by step, we were taught how to detect the Ebola virus in blood and swab samples."

More and more samples began arriving every day, from every part of the country, overwhelming the small team that had to work longer and longer days to keep up with the demand. "We had a lot to do and were working long hours," M recalls. Many people, including some of his colleagues, were terrified of the Ebola virus; 3 of his peers, with whom he had volunteered, resigned from the laboratory due to fear of getting infected with Ebola. For M, this felt like he had been abandoned in the middle of a desperate fight. "It felt like they retreated from the battlefield while the war was still on."

When M developed a fever, he knew it was likely to be Ebola. He had seen so many colleagues sicken and die and hoped he was wrong. He 1st tested his blood for malaria, using a rapid diagnostic test kit. But the results came back negative. "Knowing that I had Ebola symptoms, I started to isolate myself and allowed no one to come into my room," he said. However, M soon realized he needed treatment. Persuading staff at the Kenema Hospital that he had Ebola and that they needed to protect themselves was difficult. "I asked my colleagues to be fully dressed in personal protective equipment before taking my blood sample. They didn't take me seriously at 1st, but I insisted," said M, who stayed at the hospital while waiting for the results.

Several hours later, he got the news he was dreading. He had indeed tested positive for the Ebola virus disease. "A lot went through my mind at the time but all leading nowhere." M does not recall much more from this time, as his condition deteriorated rapidly. However, he does recall the crucial difference made by having spiritual support. At the peak of the outbreak, various religious groups offered prayers and psychosocial support services to patients from safe distances within the Ebola treatment centres. "The regular prayers and counselling offered by the pastors and imams played a great part in my survival. They gave me hope and made me believe I could survive. I am very grateful to them," he said.

The Lassa fever laboratory in Kenema is now one of many laboratories where suspected Ebola samples can be tested. M has returned to work as a blood collector, collecting blood samples from people with suspected infections such as Lassa fever, Ebola and other diseases [Read more stories of Ebola health workers...].
