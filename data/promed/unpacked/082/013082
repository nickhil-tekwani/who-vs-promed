FedEx no longer to transport bioterror germs in wake of anthrax lab mishaps
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shipping giant FedEx no longer is willing to transport packages containing research specimens of potential bioterror pathogens in the wake of high-profile safety mistakes by an Army lab that unknowingly shipped live anthrax for years, according to a letter the company sent to federal regulators and obtained by USA Today.

FedEx's refusal to transport these kinds of specimens is drawing concern among officials at major laboratories, who say it was the primary way they sent and received critical samples used to diagnose diseases and for the development of vaccines, treatments, tests and detection equipment. Neither UPS nor the US Postal Service will transport the specimens. "It potentially is a devastating blow," said James Le Duc, director of the Galveston National Laboratory in Texas, a major high-containment research facility that has 2 to 3 shipments a month. Le Duc said much of infectious-disease research involves pathogens found in the wild in other parts of the world, which requires the shipment of specimens. "Everybody is kind of dumbfounded that this has happened," Le Duc said [Wed 29 Jul 2015].

If there were an outbreak of disease caused by a potential bioterror pathogen, fast shipments would be critical. "If that were to happen now, most public health labs could not ship specimens overnight to CDC, and the national public health response would be disrupted and delayed," said Eric Blank, a senior director at the Association of Public Health Laboratories, whose members include state health department labs.

FedEx's director of dangerous goods administration sent a letter to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on [17 Jul 2015] saying it will no longer accept packages containing "select agents" for transport, according to a copy of the letter. In a statement Wednesday, Melissa Charbonneau, FedEx communications director, [Wed 29 Jul 2015] the action was taken in response to concerns over the military's recent anthrax shipments. The company has no plans to resume shipments of select agents, she said. "While we understand the questions about public health, our internal investigation has found no indication of risk to our employees or the public, and we remain committed to the safety of our teams and the communities we serve," Charbonneau said. She wouldn't say whether FedEx transported the Army's controversial anthrax shipments, citing customer confidentiality policies, nor would she say how many select-agent shipments FedEx handled a year.

"Select agent" is the federal government's term for 65 types of viruses, bacteria, and toxins that are highly regulated because of their potential to be used as bioweapons or that are considered to pose serious risks to public health or agriculture. They include anthrax, Ebola, and the pathogens that cause plague and botulism. In order to possess select agents for research, labs must be registered with the Federal Select Agent Program, which is jointly run by the CDC and the US Department of Agriculture. To ship or share specimens, labs must get permission from regulators.

Commercial carriers are commonly used for shipping specimens. Since 2003, there have been about 4250 transfers of select agents, according to the Federal Select Agent Program's website, with only one confirmed shipping loss.

The CDC last week [week of 20 Jul 2015] notified 310 top officials at labs registered to work with select-agent pathogens that FedEx was no longer an option for shipments. There is currently only one remaining commercial carrier that continues to accept select agents, the CDC said in a statement in response to USA Today's questions. "Another commercial carrier has indicated to CDC it is in the process of establishing a program to handle select-agent packages. Discussions between the carrier and CDC are ongoing," the agency said. It wouldn't name the carriers.

But officials at research labs said the only company currently willing to transport select agents is World Courier, described on its website as a specialty logistics company. Officials at World Courier's US regional office in New Hyde Park, New York, did not respond to interview requests.

World Courier doesn't have the same capabilities as FedEx, laboratory officials said. "World Courier accepts shipments of select agents, but it does not provide nationwide service like FedEx," Blank said. "If a public health lab is not located in a World Courier distribution center, there is currently no option for rapid shipment of a select agent." An alternative would be to ship specimens by ground transport, he said.

Research labs are worried about the impact on their science. "This is going to delay our ability to get work done," said Gregory Bowen, director of Battelle's biomedical research center near Columbus, Ohio. "We have studies that are on tight schedules to begin with, but without material we need to continue the studies, we can't do anything."

Other major carriers said they do not handle select-agent packages.

"UPS does not accept 'select agents' and never has," said UPS public relations director Susan Rosenberg. "Decisions by our competitor do not change our current processes, since we do not accept these substances into the UPS network."

The US Postal Service also won't transport select agents or infectious substances and has no plans to, said spokeswoman Sue Brennan. Officials at DHL were not immediately available for comment.

The decision by FedEx is the latest fallout over concerns about lab safety and security issues that have grown over the past year in the wake of several high-profile incidents. An ongoing USA Today Media Network investigation has revealed widespread safety lapses at government, university, and private labs nationwide -- and pervasive secrecy that obscures failings by researchers and federal regulators.

CDC: DoD anthrax errors involved 575 shipments
----------------------------------------------
The inadvertent transfer of potentially live _Bacillus anthracis_ (BA) samples by a US Army lab in Utah over the past decade involved a total of 575 separate shipments to other labs, including those that received the materials indirectly, a federal health official testified today [28 Jul 2015].

Daniel M Sosin, MD, MPH, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), reported the number of shipments in testimony prepared for a US House subcommittee hearing today [28 Jul 2015] on the recent revelation that the Army lab sent potentially live BA samples to 86 other labs over a period of 10 years. Another 106 labs received the material secondarily, according to recent reports. The bacterium causes anthrax.

In other prepared testimony, a Department of Defense (DoD) official said a total of 31 US lab workers were put on prophylactic antibiotic treatment because of possible exposure to the live samples, which is 10 more than reported by the DoD yesterday [27 Jul 2015].

The DoD official also promised that the Army would conduct an "accountability assessment" of institutions and personnel at Dugway Proving Ground, the Army lab that shipped the BA samples. ... more

[To quote a colleague: "The irony is that the DoD shipments of putatively killed anthrax spores, but actually live, were not shipments of 'select agents' since inactivated select agents are not deemed 'select agents'. And when Dugway, USAMRIID, ECBC, and NMRC resume producing and shipping inactivated anthrax spores, they still will be able to ship by FedEx (since inactive select agents still will not be deemed 'select agents').

The new restrictions resulting from these Dugway revelations have had a devastating impact on research. To quote Jim Le Duc, of Galveston National Laboratory, much of infectious-disease research involves pathogens found in the wild in other parts of the world, which requires the shipment of specimens, as well as between laboratories within the US, and as recounted to me by colleagues, even DNA between laboratories within the same building. - Mod.MHJ]
