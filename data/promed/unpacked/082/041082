Some background on Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever in Pakistan
-------------------------------------------------
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) was first reported in Pakistan in
1970, from the western region. The first case of human disease was
reported in 1976. Outbreaks were reported in Baluchistan Province during
the dry season (September to December) in 1976, 1987, and 1994. In total,
42 fatal cases were reported during the period 1976 to 2001. 3 cases (one
fatal, a surgeon) were reported in a Rawalpindi hospital in 1987. A fatal
case resulting in nosocomial transmission (9 secondary cases) was reported
in Quetta in 1994. 4 cases (2 fatal) were reported in Baluchistan Province
in 1998 - serological tests were not confirmatory.
In 2000, an outbreak of suspected CCHF was reported in Baluchistan Province
(Dukki, Murgha Kibzai, and Sunjavi) - 41 cases (12 fatal). Total cases for
2000 to 2001 are estimated at 115, with 34 to 39 deaths. 2 fatal cases
(Islamabad and Peshawar) were confirmed in 2001; 3 (fatal, in Rawalpindi)
during January to February 2002 - including one physician.
The virus has been found in ticks in the Changa-Manga forest (Lahore) and
in Hunza (Galgit Agency).
