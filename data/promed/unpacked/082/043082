Influenza update 122 -- 3 Dec 2010
-----------------------------------
Summary: Worldwide, influenza activity remained low, except in areas
of South Asia and central and western Africa, which have seen recent
surges in influenza H1N1 (2009) virus detections. As the northern
hemisphere winter approaches, with few exceptions, most countries in
the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere continued to report low
levels of ILI [influenza-like illness] and influenza virus
detections. Except for a few countries in Southeast Asia, most
countries in the tropics of the Americas and Asia have recently
reported low levels of influenza activity. Globally, there continued
to be co-circulation of influenza H1N1 (2009), A(H3N2), B viruses,
with the latter 2 being predominant.

Countries in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere
------------------------
In North America, overall influenza activity and levels of ILI
remained below baseline. Notably, however, in the southeastern part
of the United States, influenza activity has steadily increased over
the month of November 2010; in the southwestern region, as of the 3rd
week of November 2010, approximately 17 percent of respiratory
specimens tested positive for influenza, including both influenza
A(H3N2) and B viruses, with the later being predominant.

Most countries of the European region continued to report low overall
levels of ILI and low to sporadic levels of influenza virus
detections. In Bulgaria and the Russian Federation, a medium
intensity of respiratory diseases activity was reported; however, it
is not yet known if these increases were associated with circulation
of influenza viruses.

In East Asia, overall influenza activity remained low across China,
Japan, and the Republic of Korea. In northern China, the number of
respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza (primarily
influenza A(H3N2)) increased between late October and mid-November
2010; however, the increase in the detection rate was associated with
only a small rise the levels of ILI. Mongolia, during mid to late
November 2010, reported an increase in the detection rate of
influenza A(H3N2) viruses, which was associated with an increase in
the rate of ILI above the seasonal threshold, suggesting that the
local winter influenza season has begun.

Countries in the temperate zone of the Southern Hemisphere
-------------------------------
Overall, little influenza activity is being reported as the summer
months approach in countries of the temperate Southern Hemisphere.
Late season and regionally variable epidemics of influenza A(H3N2)
virus in Chile and Argentina now appear to have largely subsided. In
South Africa, influenza activity has also largely subsided after a
period of low level springtime circulation of influenza B and H1N1
(2009) viruses detected in the sentinel ILI surveillance system
during November 2010.

Countries in the tropical zone
-----------------------------
In South Asia, only Sri Lanka reported a recent surge of influenza
H1N1 (2009) virus detections during mid-October through late November
2010; however, to date there have not been reports of unusual
clinical severity of cases. In India and Bangladesh, influenza
activity observed during recent months has now largely subsided. In
Southeast Asia, several countries continued to report low to moderate
levels of influenza A(H3N2) virus detections.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, overall influenza activity remained low in
most countries, except in Cameroon and Ethiopia, which as of early to
mid- November 2010, reported a recent surge in the numbers of
specimens testing positive for H1N1 (2009) virus [18 (69 percent) of
26 specimens testing positive in Ethiopia and 18 (23 percent) of 79
specimens testing positive in Cameroon]. The extent to which these
increased detections of influenza virus have been associated with
increased ILI in the community is not yet known. Across the rest of
the region, low to moderate levels of influenza A(H3N2) virus
circulation continued to be detected in Kenya and Ghana, respectively.

In the tropical zone of the Americas, overall influenza activity
remained low to sporadic in most areas. In Costa Rica, influenza
A(H3N2) and B viruses continued to co-circulate at low levels during
November 2010. In Columbia, small numbers of influenza H1N1 (2009)
viruses were detected during November 2010. In Bolivia, sustained
active circulation of influenza A(H3N2) viruses has been observed
since mid-September 2010. In Cuba, there has been a fluctuating low
to moderate level circulation of influenza A(H3N2) viruses since
early August 2010. In southern Mexico, influenza activity has largely
subsided after a period of active influenza A(H3N2) circulation
spanning August to mid-November 2010.

Virological surveillance
----------------------
In general, influenza virus activity remained low worldwide, with
influenza A(H3N2) predominating.

FluNet reports
--------------
During weeks 45 to 46 (7 to 20 Nov 2010), National Influenza Centres
(NICs) from 52 countries reported data to FluNet. A total of 1299
specimens were reported as positive for influenza viruses, 932 (71.7
percent) were typed as influenza A, 367 (28.3 percent) as influenza
B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses reported, 29.5 percent were
influenza H1N1(2009), and 69.6 percent were influenza A(H3N2). In
addition, very few old seasonal A(H1N1) viruses were detected, and
one A(H5N1) virus infection in a human was confirmed by laboratory.

[2] H1N1 in the UK
Date: Sat 11 Dec 2010
Source: The Independent newspaper [abbreviated & edited]
<http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/doctors-shocked-by-spread-of-swine-flu-ndash-and-its-severity-2157407.html>


The swine flu virus [Influenza A(H1N1) 2009 influenza virus] that
swept the world last year [2009] causing a global health emergency
has returned to claim the lives of 10 adults in the UK in the past 6
weeks. The 10 deaths were in younger adults under 65 and associated
with H1N1 swine flu. Most had underlying conditions but "a small
proportion" were healthy before being struck down by the virus,
according to the Health Protection Agency (HPA). Seasonal flu
normally causes severe illness and death in the elderly. The H1N1
swine flu virus targets pregnant women, younger adults, and those
with chronic conditions, making it a cause of particular alarm. No
other similar reports of deaths linked with swine flu have been
received from elsewhere in Europe. Official figures show GP
consultations for flu- like illness in England were at 13.3 per 100
000 population last week, well below baseline levels.

Flu experts expressed surprise at the relatively high incidence of
deaths and severe illness in the context of the low consultation
rates. John Watson, head of respiratory diseases at the Health
Protection Agency, said: "We seem to be in the vanguard on this.
Other European countries are just beginning to see some H1N1
activity."

Around 30 per cent of those who fell ill who went to their GP and got
tested for the virus were coming up positive for H1N1, which was a
high rate.

Flu is very difficult to predict, Dr Watson added. "I am a little
surprised to see as much activity as we seem to be seeing, both in
terms of its spread in the community and its severity. I don't see it
as being extraordinary, but it is more than I would have expected."

All parts of the country are affected, with deaths reported from each
region, according to the HPA. There were 9 flu outbreaks last week, 8
in schools and one in an army barracks in Yorkshire. Pressure has
been building on intensive care in recent days with the worst
affected patients treated on Extra-Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation
(ECMO) machines which bypass the lungs to artificially oxygenate the
blood. "A good many intensive care units are seeing severely ill
cases, including some using ECMO beds," Dr Watson said.

Swine flu [influenza A/(H1N1) 2009 virus infection] arrived last year
[2009] from Mexico creating the 1st flu pandemic for 40 years. In the
UK, the 1st wave of the pandemic struck in the summer -- unusually
for flu -- followed by a 2nd smaller wave before Christmas.

Dr Watson said: "A lot of people were infected through the 2 waves of
the last pandemic. We estimate something like 2/3rds of children and
a half of adults are likely to have been infected, even though they
may have had no symptoms. "We wouldn't anticipate a big epidemic wave
of flu activity due to H1N1 this year [2010]. But there are still a
substantial number of people who remain susceptible." Many who caught
swine flu last year suffered only minor illness, but a small number
were severely ill. There were 494 deaths in the year to April 2010.

The fear among flu experts is that the virus could mutate to cause
more severe illness or target a different section of the population,
such as the elderly who are more vulnerable. But laboratory analysis
has shown that the circulating strain of the virus is "very much the
same" as last year [2009] and has not shown "any significant change,"
according to the HPA.

Five of the 10 adults who died for whom information was available had
not received the flu vaccine, the HPA said. National figures show
vaccination rates are lower than in previous years, covering 66 per
cent of the over-65s and 40 per cent of younger adults at risk
(pregnant women and those with chronic diseases such as asthma).

Professor David Salisbury, director of immunisation at the Department
of Health said: "These figures demonstrate that the effects of flu
are not to be underestimated. It is not the same as getting a cold
and can seriously affect your health. "The seasonal flu jab protects
against the dominant strains; this year [2010], it protects against 3
types of flu, including the type known as swine flu. If you are in a
risk group, then I would urge you to visit your GP surgery and get
the vaccination as soon as possible. It is not too late to get
vaccinated for your protection and that of your family."

In addition to H1N1 swine flu, which has become the dominant
influenza A virus in Britain, about 40 per cent of virus strains
isolated this winter [2010-2011] are influenza B, which is most
common in children, causes mostly mild illness, and has been
responsible for several outbreaks in schools in recent weeks. The
last year in which it caused widespread illness was 2005-6. "There is
plenty of B about," Dr Watson said.
