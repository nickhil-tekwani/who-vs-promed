Influenza (H1N1)pdm09 outbreak at Swabi, KPK Pakistan
----------------------------
I am submitting this report about a huge influenza outbreak in the Swabi district of Khyber Pukhtunkhwa, which has been gaining momentum for the last 2 weeks. A large number of patients are visiting health facilities and those at risk of severe disease are presenting with serious complications -- so far we have lost 2 patients and more than a dozen have remain hospitalized. Logistics and manpower support are dismal; personal protective equipment (PPE), antivirals and vaccines are not available (expired UTM, PPE & N95 masks, 10 each). 6 patients are reported positive from the NIH Laboratory including 1 hospital nurse, and about 10 reports are pending.

I hope we can generate a response through your site from the responsible authorities.

ProMED-mail is thankful to Dr Amjad Mahbood for this update on the increased number of influenza cases from Swabi district in KP.

According to laboratory data [personal communication) on suspected case samples received at the National Influenza Center, NIH Islamabad, out of 13 total samples received, there are 8 H1N1(pdm09) positive cases, 1 positive for influenza B and 4 samples are negative for influenza.

The epidemiological data on these cases so far do not indicate a specific regional or age based clustering of cases. Epidemiology personnel form the Provincial Disease Surveillance and Response unit (PDSRU) KP, in collaboration with the Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program Pakistan, are regularly monitoring the developing situation at Bacha Khan Hospital, Swabi.

Furthermore , a shipment of fresh viral transport medium (VTM) has been sent to Dr Amjad Mahboob , so that samples bcan be collected timely from any new suspected cases. - Mod.UBA
