Dozens of residents of Pauh subdistrict, Kota Padang of West Sumatra
have come down with chikungunya. The residents complain of painful
joints, which make it difficult for them to move.

Residents have reported these cases, but there are not yet any
prevention efforts in place. Sufferers have taken medicine from
midwives and from the closest community health centre.

Only several have recovered. The rest of them are still lying down
and weak in convalescent areas of the local community health centre.

The residents are becoming more concerned because they have seen no
signs of spraying against the mosquitoes, which cause [transmit]
chikungunya [virus].
