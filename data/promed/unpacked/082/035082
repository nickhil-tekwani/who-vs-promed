A Comment on the Transmission of Hepatitis Viruses
--------------------------------------------------
In the Yomiuri Shimbun article that is the source of the ProMED-mail
posting on new genotypes of hepatitis E virus [archived as "Hepatitis
E virus, new genotypes - Japan 20020721.4824"], it is stated that "Of
the main viral forms of [hepatitis], which inflames the liver, only
hepatitis E virus infection can be spread by animals."
This is not correct. Hepatitis A infections have been transmitted to
humans from non-human primates (1). More than 200 cases of hepatitis
A virus infection have been transmitted from non-human primates to
humans (2), primarily from chimpanzees (_Pan troglodytes_). Other
non-human primates, including woolly monkeys, siamangs, Celebes
crested apes, and gorillas have transmitted hepatitis A virus to
humans.
Needless to say, given that chimpanzees have been experimentally
infected with hepatitis B and C viruses, there is at least the
theoretical possibility that humans could acquire these infections
from infected chimpanzees, but I am unaware of any documented cases
of transmission to humans.
