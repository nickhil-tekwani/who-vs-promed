Caprine arthritis/encephalitis, Singapore
---------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 21 Jan 2019 from Dr. Him Hoo Yap, Chief Veterinary Officer, Director General, Deputy CEO, Regulatory Programmes and Operations, Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority, Singapore, Singapore

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 29 Oct 2018
Date of confirmation of the event: 20 Nov 2018
Reason for notification: recurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 1989
Manifestation of disease: sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: caprine arthritis/encephalitis virus
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks: (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Singapore, Singapore
Date of start of the outbreak: 29 Oct 2018
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Goats / 420 / 22 / 0 / 0 / 0 /
Affected population: The affected population is the only dairy goat farm in Singapore, with a standing population of approximately 420 goats with mixed age groups, sex and breeds (Alpine, Nubian, Saanens, Toggenburg). Goats are housed in elevated sheltered sheds, separated into different pens.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Goats / 5.24 / 0 / 0 / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: Caprine arthritis/encephalitis virus (CAEV) antibodies were detected in 10 goat serum samples collected from the only dairy goat farm in Singapore as part of a point survey. These 10 positive samples have also been verified positive for CAEV antibody by the Animal and Plant Health Agency, UK. Following the detection, a field visit was conducted and an additional 12 goats tested positive on ELISA or RT-PCR. Milk samples also tested positive for CAEV antibodies and RNA. The goats did not display any clinical signs of infection with CAEV. The farmer has been advised on appropriate husbandry practices to minimise the spread in his herd through ingestion of CAEV-infected colostrum or milk or prolonged contact with infected goats (e.g. use of milk replacers or pasteurized milk for kids and segregation of sero-positive and sero-negative goats).

Control measures
Measures applied: screening, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals.
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Animal health laboratory (National laboratory) / Goats / enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)/ 20 Nov 2018 / Positive
Animal health laboratory (National laboratory) / Goats / reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 28 Nov 2018 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["Caprine arthritis-encephalitis (CAE) and maedi-visna (MV) are persistent lentivirus infections of goats and sheep. They are often grouped together as the small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs). Maedi-visna is also known as ovine progressive pneumonia (OPP). Phylogenetic analyses comparing nucleotide sequences of MV virus (MVV) and CAE virus (CAEV) have demonstrated that these are closely related lentiviruses. One source of CAEV and MVV transmission is colostrum and milk. The source of horizontal transmission in the absence of lactation remains unknown; however, faeces and lung fluids are known to harbour infectious virus. Ovine lentiviruses have been identified in most of the sheep-rearing countries of the world, with the notable exceptions of Australia and New Zealand. The distribution of CAEV is highest in industrialized countries, and seems to have coincided with the international movement of European breeds of dairy goats. Clinical and subclinical MV and CAE are associated with progressive, mononuclear cell inflammatory lesions in the lungs, joints, udder and central nervous system. Indurative mastitis is common in both host species, and its economic significance may be underestimated. Laboured breathing associated with emaciation caused by progressive pneumonitis is the predominant feature in clinically affected sheep, whereas polyarthritis is the main clinical sign in goats. However, most lentivirus-infected sheep and goats are largely asymptomatic, but remain persistent carriers of virus and are capable of transmitting infection via colostrum or milk and respiratory secretions.

"The most practical and reliable approach to confirming a diagnosis of MV or CAE is a combination of serology and clinical evaluation. Although serology represents the most cost-effective method of diagnosing infection in persistently infected, clinically normal animals, it should be understood that testing errors can occur. The frequency of error depends on several factors including but not limited to: 1) the assay format, 2) the homology between the strain of virus used in the assay and the strains of virus present in the tested populations, and 3) the viral antigen used in the assay."
