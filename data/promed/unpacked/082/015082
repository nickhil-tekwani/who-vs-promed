Encephalitis deaths rise above 1140 in north India
-----------------------------------------------
The official death toll from Japanese encephalitis in the northern
Indian state of Uttar Pradesh has climbed to more than 1140.
"6 more persons died of encephalitis (overnight), taking the toll to
1142," said Dr. O P Singh, health services director general in Uttar
Pradesh. "A majority of the dead are children," he told AFP in
Lucknow, the state capital.
More than 200 people remain in state-run hospitals with the
mosquito-borne disease, and over 4800 encephalitis cases have been
reported across Uttar Pradesh since mid-July 2005. But Singh said the
worst was over for the impoverished state of 180 million people.
"With the onset of winter, the virus responsible for the spread of
encephalitis will die," he said on Wednesday [19 Oct 2005].
The outbreak was first reported from Gorakhpur, 250 km (155 miles)
southeast of Lucknow. Dr. K P Kishwaha, head of pediatrics at BRD
College in Gorakhpur, said over 900 children have died in Gorakhpur
alone. "The number of deaths could be much more, as government has no
records about children dying in private nursing homes and in villages
without medicines," he said.
Health minister Jaiveer Singh said that the government would start a
vaccination drive in November 2005 to tackle next year's expected outbreak.
Japanese encephalitis first surfaced in Uttar Pradesh in 1978,
killing 721 people, and has become endemic. Deaths hit a record 1228
in 1988. Over 4000 people have died in the state since the disease first hit.
