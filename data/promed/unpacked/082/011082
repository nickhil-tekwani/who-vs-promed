Maine health officials say a child in Cumberland County became ill
with a novel strain of swine flu after being exposed to swine at an
agricultural fair earlier this month [October 2011]. Maine Center for
Disease Control director Dr Sheila Pinette says the federal CDC
[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] has confirmed the novel
strain. Pinette says the child was not hospitalized and is recovering
from the illness.

No other human cases have turned up. The Maine CDC and Department of
Agriculture are currently investigating exposures, Pinette says. She
says the type of influenza identified in the child is similar to other
infections that people have caught from swine and contains a genetic
component of the pandemic H1N1 virus that swept through Maine in
2009.

The novel virus that sickened the child is known as the H3N2 virus and
rarely infects humans, Pinette says. She says the virus is genetically
similar to 4 previous cases found in the United States this year
[2011], 3 of them in Pennsylvania and one in Indiana. All of those
sickened in those incidents had been exposed to swine. Pinette says
the case that has turned up in Maine appears to be an isolated one,
and there is no indication of any person-to-person transmission.

[Background from "Reported human infections with swine-origin
influenza viruses (SOIV) in the United States since 2005," (CDC
website, http://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/soiv_cases.htm): As of 9
Sep 2011, 25 cases of human infection with swine origin influenza
viruses have been reported in the United States. These are viruses
that normally infect pigs. Like human influenza viruses, there are
different subtypes and strains of swine-origin influenza viruses. The
main swine influenza viruses circulating in US pigs in recent years
are swine triple reassortant (tr) H1N1 influenza virus, trH3N2 virus
and trH1N2 virus. Of the 25 human cases reported since 2005, 12 have
been trH1N1 viruses; 12 have been trH3N2 viruses and one has been a
trH1N2 virus. All 25 persons infected with swine viruses recovered
from their illnesses. 18 cases occurred in children (persons 18 or
younger), and 7 cases occurred in adults. In 21 cases, direct or
indirect exposure to swine prior to onset of illness has been
identified. Likely transmission of swine-origin influenza virus from
close contact with an infected person has been observed in
investigations of human infections with swine-origin influenza A virus
but has not resulted in sustained human-to-human transmission.

The type of influenza identified in the Maine case is similar to more
recent rare human infections with a swine-origin H3N2 reassortant
virus, which contains a genetic component of the pandemic H1N1 virus.
The Maine virus is genetically similar to 4 previous cases identified
in the United States this year (2011), 3 in Pennsylvania, and one in
Indiana (see the ProMED-mail references below), all of which had
exposure to swine. The child in Maine became ill in early October 2011
with symptoms similar to seasonal influenza including fever, cough,
headache, sore throat, and myalgia. Prior to illness, the child had
exposure to swine, including time spent in a closed setting at an
agricultural fair. Maine CDC and the Department of Agriculture are
currently investigating exposures. Presently, this is an isolated
event, and Maine CDC has not confirmed any person-to-person
transmission.
