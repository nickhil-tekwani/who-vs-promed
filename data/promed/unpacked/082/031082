Re: ProMED-mail Bluetongue - Europe (46): BTV-8, UK, Italy
(suspected, request for information) 20071020.342
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In response to your request for information:

A considerable number of bovines, imported to Italy in August 2007
from France to premises in Lombardy, Piedmont, and Emilia-Romagna
[see map at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/europe/italy_admin_06.jpg>], have
been found later to be positive for bluetongue (serology and PCR
[polymerase chain reaction], but no virus isolation). Subsequently,
sampling from local susceptible animals was carried out. This
included all (100 percent) of the animals in the recipient holdings,
and animals kept in their vicinity. All samples have been found, so
far, negative.

The sentinel system sampling has been intensified in number and
frequency; we consider, therefore, that until we do find positive
(serology, or PCR, or virus isolation) contacts and/or within 3 km (2
mi) radius contacts and/or sentinels, the virus does not circulate
and Italy is not infected by BTV-8. However, we consider that we have
imported antibody/antigen positive animals.

The animals were shipped from French districts, which -- in August
[2007] -- were considered not to be infected. It may be assumed that
the infection did exist there, but could not be detected by the then
prevailing surveillance system. Another possibility is that the
imported animals had been moved earlier from infected regions.

In any case, the difficulty of BTV to spread in the Padanian
[northern Italy] environment seems to have been demonstrated.

[We are most grateful for Prof Caporale's 1st-hand, authoritative
information, which sets the issue straight. Fortunately, Italy
remains free of BTV-8.

According to the currently available information, the southern part
of Italy is considered infected by the Mediterranean BTV serotypes
2,4,9, and 16; see EFSA's (European Food Safety Authority) map at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/BlueTongue_RestrictedZones.jpg>.

Since 2002, Italy has implemented mass vaccinations to protect local
livestock against the said serotypes. The results were promising
(excluding the modified-live BTV-16 vaccine, found unsafe and the use
of which discontinued). For details, see the reference below.

Should BTV-8 continue its spread southwards from Germany and France
and penetrate Italy, it may be assumed that the same vaccination
policy will be applied. - Mod.AS]
