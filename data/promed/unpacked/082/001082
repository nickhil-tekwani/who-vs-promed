Mycoplasma pneumonia, outbreak? - USA (Kansas): RFI 981116231050

From: Duchin, Jeff <Jeff.Duchin@METROKC.GOV>

In Seattle we are currently investigating an increase in pneumonia among
grade school aged children that appears to be due to _M. pneumoniae_.
Although we have not yet recovered the organism in culture, several cases
have had positive acute mycoplasma IgM titers and there are cases with
bullous myringitis. The clinical picture is characterized by fever, cough
(which may last weeks) and often, pharyngitis, with an incubation period of
2-3 weeks. Although affected individuals have had a clinical response to
new macrolides, the outbreak has been persistent over several months.
There are no recommended effective chemoprophylactic strategies. This may
be due to a combination of factors including the long incubation period and
the persistence of nasopharyngeal carriage after antimicrobial treatment
(at least with older agents). Epidemic mycoplasma pneumonia activity tends
to occur in 4-7 year cycles, my recollection is the last big year was 1993-4.

I am a pediatrician and critical care physician here in Maracaibo. I work
in two 100 bed private hospitals. I have seen many cases as the ones you
describe, but in children all ages. Usually [itstarts like a viral
disease, just like the flu. The patient might not even be coughing, but in
the physical exam you find all kinds of rales, as if there was a huge
pneumonia. Some of them without even slight dyspnea. I immediately treat
them with macrolides with good response. The CXR are usually interstitial
and diffuse, but some are lobar. [The WBC count is low for the CXR
findings, and some even [suggesting viral etiology. Some [patients are
referred by other pediatricians and many different treatments [have been
instituted, but they get to be fine as soon as they start the macrolide. I
am happy to know I am not alone in this.

[Two readers have corrected my indication that Whiteman AFB was in Kansas.
It is indeed in Missouri. It is noteworthy that Dr. Ferrero's contribution
is not from the USA, but I hope readers will indulge me as I attempt to
hold the titles of postings in the thread together. - Mod.ES
