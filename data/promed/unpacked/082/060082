["Several animal species have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, with infection being introduced to a population as a result of close contact with humans or animals infected with SARS-CoV-2 or in experimental infection studies performed in laboratory settings. The list of animal species for which information on natural or experimental infection is available is presented in Table 1."

"People who are suspected or confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 should restrict contact with mammalian animals, including pets, just like they would with people during their illness."
