The National Service for Animal Health (SENASA) attended 2 horses infected with Venezuelan equine encephalitis [VEE virus] in Bagaces [Guanacaste province, Costa Rica]. Although this is a small outbreak, an alert was issued because this is a viral disease that can be transmitted to people through mosquito bites.

In equine animals, it can produce depression, lack of motor coordination, blindness, irritability and aggressiveness.

Generally, [infected] people do not show symptoms. However, severe cases can present with:
- Acute headache
- Fever
- Chills
- Vomiting
- Edema of the brain
- Disorientation
- Motor uncoordination
- Convulsions
- Coma

"It is possible that an [equine] patient may have sequelae affecting the central nervous system after the [acute phase of the] infection," SENASA stated, where they await confirmation of other cases in Liberia municipality [Guanacaste province].

The Service recommends that people in this area protect themselves by using insect repellant; wearing clothing that covers exposed skin, such as long pants and long-sleeved shirts; and staying within buildings during the hours of most mosquito activity, that is, at dawn or dusk.

"In order to control mosquito populations, it is recommended that objects be eliminated that can serve as [mosquito] breeding sites, and, if necessary, carry out fumigation," SENASA stated.

In horses, this disease is preventable through vaccination.

[Sporadic cases of equine encephalitis occur sporadically throughout Central America, including Costa Rica. They usually go undiagnosed. However, there have been confirmed equine and human cases of VEE in neighboring Panama (Darien region) last month (September 2015). For these 2 Costa Rican cases, Dr. Jimenez indicated that the disease was 1st diagnosed clinically and then confirmed by IgM capture ELISA serology. He indicated that attempts are being made currently to obtain VEE virus sequences from brain tissue that could permit identification of the virus subtype responsible for the deaths of these horses. Owners of equine animals are well advised to follow the recommendation to have their animals vaccinated against VEE.

ProMED thanks Dr. Jimenez S. for providing the information.
