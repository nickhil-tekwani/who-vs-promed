ACT Health has issued a warning for people who attended the Spilt Milk festival in Canberra last weekend to be alert to the symptoms of meningococcal disease after a case was detected at Canberra Hospital.

"There is a case of meningococcal disease in an individual who attended the Spilt Milk Festival," ACT Health said on Saturday [3 Dec 2022].

Close contacts of the individual are being identified and contacted directly, but people who were at Exhibition Park in Canberra on 26 Nov [2022] should be alert to symptoms of the disease and "act immediately" if they appear, the health authority said.

Meningococcal is a serious disease that can cause infection of the membranes around the brain and spinal cord and infection of the blood, both of which are severe infections that can lead to death.

The case was detected in a festivalgoer at the Canberra date of Spilt Milk, an annual music festival held in Canberra and Ballarat and established in 2016. This year [2022], an additional date was scheduled for the Gold Coast, with headlining acts including Flume, The Wombats, Spacey Jane, and G-Flip.

ACT Chief Health Officer Dr Kerryn Coleman said meningococcal disease was uncommon but could be severe and lead to life-long complications or death.

Symptoms include sudden onset of fever, headache, neck stiffness, joint pain, a rash of red-purple spots or bruises, dislike of bright lights, and nausea and vomiting.

While the rash is among the more well-known symptoms, Coleman said it "may not be present at all, or may come very late in the illness," and not all the symptoms may appear at the same time.

Symptoms in young children include irritability, difficulty waking, high-pitched crying, and refusal to eat.

Coleman also said it was possible for people to be asymptomatic but infectious.

"People can carry meningococcal bacteria in their throats and not have symptoms, but pass it on to close contacts," she said. "If you suspect symptoms of meningococcal disease, please seek medical review immediately."

While it can have significant consequences, about 5-10% of the population carry meningococcal bacteria in their nose and throat at any given time, and few people become unwell as a result.

It is transmitted from person to person through contact with respiratory secretions, but the bacteria is not easily spread and usually requires very close prolonged contact such as deep, intimate kissing or living in the same household to be passed between people. It is not easily spread by sharing drinks, food, or cigarettes.

People between the ages of 15 and 25 are at the greatest risk of contracting the disease.

Vaccination has made meningococcal disease uncommon, but it has appeared before at a music festival. In August [2022], NSW Health urged patrons of the Splendour in the Grass festival to monitor for symptoms of meningococcal disease, after 2 revellers contracted the disease and one died.

Vaccinations are provided for free for all children at 12 months of age, adolescents, and people of all ages with certain medical conditions and remains the best way to protect people from the disease.

[On 6 Aug 2022, ProMED posted a report of the death of a man in his 40s from Sydney with the meningococcal disease (ProMED post Meningitis, meningococcal - Australia (05): (NS) fatal, RFI 20220806.8704895). We were not told of the meningococcal serogroup involved or epidemiologic linkage to other cases. A week later, ProMED posted reports that the Sydney man in his 40s had attended the Splendour in the Grass music festival about 2 weeks earlier, as did 2 other persons who developed meningococcal disease (ProMED post Meningitis, meningococcal - Australia (06): (NS) fatal, 3 cases, festival, RFI 20220813.8705018). No further information has ever been given about patient characteristics, epidemiologic linkages (other than having attended the music festival), or the meningococcal serogroup(s) involved.

Now, the news article reports another case of meningococcal meningitis in a person who attended music festival (the Spilt Milk festival in Canberra at Exhibition Park) on 26 Nov 2022. We are not given further details about the case or the meningococcal serogroup involved. We are told close contacts of the case are being identified, but so far no other case of invasive meningococcal disease among attendees of the Split Milk music festival are known. More information on this case and any further epidemiologically linked cases would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Spilt Milk is an annual music festival that is held in Canberra Exhibition Park, Australia, and Ballarat, Australia. A map showing the location of Canberra Exhibition Park can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_Park_in_Canberra#/map/0. - Mod.ML
