6 people in Woodruff are being treated after possibly being exposed to rabies by a cat that tested positive for the disease, the Department of Health and Environmental Control announced on Friday [18 Sep 2015]. DHEC said the exposures occurred on [Sunday & Monday] Sept. 13 and 14 after a family's cat, which was not current on rabies vaccinations, suffered a wound of unknown origin and was not immediately taken to a veterinarian. 5 family members and 1 other individual were "bitten or otherwise potentially exposed," a news release stated.

The cat was euthanized and tested positive for rabies on Wednesday [16 Sep 2015].

"Although wild animals contract rabies most often, domestic pets can contract the disease as well," said Sandra Craig of DHEC's Bureau of Environmental Health Services. "To reduce the risk of getting rabies, we recommend that people avoid wild animals acting tame and tame animals acting wild. About 275 South Carolinians must undergo preventive treatment for rabies every year, with most exposures coming from bites or scratches by a rabid or suspected rabid animal."

Craig advised anyone who have become exposed to the rabies virus through a bite, scratch or the saliva of a possibly infected animal, to immediately wash the affected area with plenty of soap and water, get medical attention and report the incident to DHEC.

Craig also encourages pet owners to keep their animals vaccinated against rabies.

There have been 97 confirmed rabies cases in animals statewide so far in 2015, DHEC reported. The cat was the 4th animal to test positive in 2015 from Spartanburg County.

It is clear that any and all domestic animals behind in their rabies vaccinations should be vaccinated now without delay. And this should also be considered for valued livestock. - Mod MHJ
