Abstract
--------
We describe a patient in Argentina with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Although both coronavirus disease and HPS can be fatal when not diagnosed and treated promptly, HPS is much more lethal. This case report may contribute to improved detection of co-infections in HPS-endemic regions.

[Case report]
We describe a case of SARS‐CoV‐2 and Andes virus co-infection in central Argentina. The patient, a 22-year-old woman without relevant pathologic records, sought care at a local hospital in November 2020 for fever, headache, myalgia, and gastrointestinal manifestations. A nasopharyngeal swab sample tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription PCR at the Instituto Biológico "Tomás Perón". The patient's clinical status worsened 5 days after the onset of fever, and she was admitted to the hospital. Clinical laboratory findings at admission indicated thrombocytopenia, high leukocyte count, lymphopenia, and elevated hepatic enzymes. Computed tomography revealed bilateral pleural effusion associated with interstitial infiltration, and capillary filtration with slight peripheral pulmonary ground-glass opacity.

Within a few hours after admission, the patient had onset of marked respiratory distress. She was then referred to the intensive care unit for orotracheal intubation and treated with ampicillin/sulbactam and azithromycin. The epidemiologic investigation established that the patient resided in a hantavirus-endemic area. Consequently, HPS was suspected, despite the COVID-19-positive diagnosis. According to the confirmation criteria used by the Hantavirus National Reference Laboratory, Andes virus infection was confirmed by the detection of specific IgM and IgG by ELISA and genomic viral RNA by quantitative reverse transcription PCR in blood.

The patient was extubated 3 days after the co-infection was confirmed, and progressed favorably. She was discharged from the hospital 20 days after onset of symptoms.

[Conclusion]
Because the HPS incubation period is longer than that for COVID-19, we might speculate that hantavirus infection occurred before coronavirus infection. The respiratory distress syndrome appeared 5 days after the onset of fever, which coincided with the characteristic prodromal period described for HPS. This condition, during the incubation period of HPS, could have induced a higher susceptibility to COVID-19. Because HPS can evolve rapidly to respiratory failure in most patients with severe disease, resulting in high case-fatality rates, alerting health-care workers from HPS-endemic areas is warranted to detect co-infections in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, at least 2 genotypes of Andes virus can be transmitted person-to-person, and these species are prevalent in 2 of the 3 hantavirus-endemic regions of Argentina.

In conclusion, we detected co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and Andes virus causing HPS in a patient from a hantavirus-endemic area. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of co-infection for patients originating, residing, or traveling in hantavirus-endemic areas.

This case is an interesting example of the diagnostic challenge that a dual infection with 2 different pathogens can present, especially when early symptoms of each may be similar. Apparently, the patient came from an area in Argentina where Andes hantavirus is endemic, alerting attending physicians to this virus as a possible pathogen responsible for her illness and the presence of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in the area suggesting SARS-CoV-2 virus as another. Effective laboratory support identified both of the pathogens involved in this case. - Mod.TY
