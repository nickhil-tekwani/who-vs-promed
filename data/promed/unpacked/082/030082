China's pig herd could halve by the end of 2019 from a year earlier as an epidemic of African swine fever [ASF] sweeps through the world's top pork producer, analysts at Dutch bank Rabobank forecast on [Tue 30 Jul 2019].

The bank said China's herd, by far the world's biggest, was already estimated to have shrunk by 40% from a year ago, well above official estimates which have ranged from 15% to 26%.

The forecast comes amid industry speculation that the decline has been much worse than confirmed by agriculture officials, who this month [July 2019] launched an investigation of local authorities' efforts to contain the disease.

Rabobank said China's pork production in 2019 was expected to fall by 25% from the previous year, a smaller drop than pig herd loss due to the large number of animals slaughtered in 1st half of 2019.

Output of pork, China's favorite meat, will likely drop by a further 10% to 15% in 2020, it said in a report.

Production may take more than 5 years to recover to levels prior to the deadly outbreaks as challenges including a lack of solutions to prevent the disease and a lack of capital will restrict restocking, it added.

Reuters reported earlier this month [July 2019] that as many as half of China's breeding pigs have either died from ASF or been slaughtered because of the spreading disease.

Rabobank, which late last year [2018] estimated China's pig herd at 360 million animals, said in April [2019] that up to 200 million pigs could be culled or die due to the disease, while pork output could fall by 30%.

[The Chinese media continues reporting on recurring outbreaks in locations known to be infected earlier (for example, "African swine fever cases detected in Liaoning," 28 Jul 2019, at http://www.china.org.cn/china/2019-07/28/content_75040269.htm). ASF circulation has already been officially recorded in all of China's continental provinces/administrative units (see map at https://www.pigprogress.net/Health/African-Swine-Fever/ASF-China). The significance of the additional reports is rather limited.

Factually, China has been suffering, since July 2018, probably one of the most devastating epizootics in the known history of veterinary medicine. Fortunately for us humans, not a zoonosis, but on top of the enormous economic impact, a serious animal suffering and environmental issue.

The fact that ASF is not pathogenic to humans should not lead to neglecting the prescribed elementary requirements to prevent the wide-scale and rapid dissemination of the disease. Recycling of ASF infected/suspected-as-infected material, including pork and its products, and uncontrolled movement of feed and fomites, such as shoes, clothes, vehicles, equipment, and packing material, are, due to the high resistance of ASF virus in the environment, potential sources for its spread. The advance of this devastating pig disease, against which no vaccine is available to date, throughout 3 continents is, at least partially, due to such neglect.

OIE and FAO convened the 2nd meeting of the GF-TADs [Global Framework for the Progressive Control of Transboundary Animal Diseases] Standing Group of Experts on ASF for Asia in Tokyo, Japan on 30-31 Jul 2019. The meeting aims to develop recommendations on biosecurity and border controls that can help curb the spread of ASF and its devastating consequences. - Mod.AS
