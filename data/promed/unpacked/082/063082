[Re: ProMED-mail Poliomyelitis - worldwide (16): Nigeria, global 20111122.3421]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Overlooked in this excellent update of worldwide poliomyelitis through
[16 Nov 2011] is that with only 6 weeks to go in the year, India has
had only one reported case of polio. This is an astonishing
achievement that many would have thought impossible a few years ago.
As one of the last countries in the world to have been unable to
interrupt polio transmission, India is coming very close to that
elusive goal. In fact, the article reported by ProMED describes
Nigeria as one of 4 countries in the world where polio is still a
major health risk, with 42 cases. Pakistan (145 cases) and Afghanistan
(53 cases) are 2 of the others. If the current success is sustained,
India, with one case this year, could soon be dropped from this list.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr Joffe for highlighting the
successes seen in India. As he so correctly points out, of the 4
remaining polio endemic countries, India has reported only one case of
wild poliovirus (WPV) associated paralytic poliomyelitis during 2011,
with date of onset of this case 13 Jan 2011, in West Bengal (see
http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek.aspx).

For the map of reported WPV associated paralytic polio cases during
2011 (as of 16 Nov 2011), see
