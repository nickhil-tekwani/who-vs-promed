[from El Nacional, Caracas, 3 April 1997; from an article by Alonso Zambrano]
In the region of Zulia, there have been 517 cases of cholera registered and
21 fatalities since the epidemic began in July of last year. The secretary of
the government, German Valero, reported that patients are arriving in Zulia
from the state of Merida, victims of an outbreak that is still uncontrolled
and was discovered in populations in the vicinity of Caja Seca, Sucre,
Guayabones, Cano Zancudo, and Tucanizon. The epidemic is growing apparently
due to fishermen from shores of Lake Maracaibo. In addition to town of
Rosario in the area of Barranquitas, there is cholera in the town of Santa
Rita on the east coast of Lake Maracaibo.
This Wednesday, 25 cases of cholera were confirmed among 200 vacationers who
ate contaminated fish at a farm in Maracaibo during Holy Week. [The fish was
prepared by food handlers among whom was a patient positive for the disease.]
Miriam Morales, epidemiologist of Zulia, indicated that they are waiting for
results of other analyses in order to precisely judge the impact of this
local contamination.
