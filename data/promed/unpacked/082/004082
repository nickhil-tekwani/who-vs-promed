We've had no more kangaroo deaths since last year. We were unable to find
the cause of the encephalitis. We tried virus culture on various cell
lines, PCR with both general and specific primers for various viruses,
including herpesviridae, _in situ_ hybridisation for bornavirus, and TBE
serology, but it gave nothing. We also checked for toxoplasma, neospora,
sarcosystis, and listeria, and performed general bacterial culture, again
finding nothing.
Finally we sent all the material we had left to Australia, where Peter
Hooper and his group continued looking for a virus. They think
they might have found something with IHC but have so far been
unable to culture it.
No vacuoles were found anywhere on histopathological examination
[i.e., not spongiform. - Mod.JW, only a non-purulent envephalitis that
our pathologists swear has to be viral.
So, we still don't know the cause of the kangaroo deaths, but we still
believe it's a virus. We did check, and no personnel were sick either
before, during, or after the outbreak.
