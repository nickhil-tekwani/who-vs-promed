["FMD outbreaks occurred on 5 Oct 2016 on 2 cattle farms located in Bafata, Guinea-Bissau. The Senegalese Agricultural Research Institute, Dakar (regional reference laboratory) confirmed the diagnosis on 28 Oct 2016. The laboratory examined 92 sera and a pool of 6 vesicular fluids collected from the outbreaks. Antibodies against non-structural proteins were detected in 18 sera, and their reactivity was against FMDV serotypes O and A (11 animals positive for A and O, 6 animals positive for O, and one positive for A), while SAT1 and SAT2 antigens were detected in the pool of vesicular fluids; for this reason it was not possible to identify the number of animals positive for each serotype. Source of the outbreak is unknown, and the only sanitary measure to be applied is vaccination.

"Scarce or no information is available relative to the FMDV serotypes circulating in this country. The last outbreak reported in the country was in 2014, while the presence of the disease was still suspected in 2015" (see <www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/docs/FMD_monthly_reports/2016/December_2016.pdf>).

The outbreaks that occurred in October 2016 were not reported to the OIE until December 2016. According to the final report sent to the OIE on 26 Jun 2017, the event was resolved March 2017. 1500 bovines were vaccinated against serotypes O, A, and SAT2 in the Santanto and Cadjito, Bafata region.
