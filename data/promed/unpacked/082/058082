2 cleared of bird flu in Malaysia as efforts intensify to contain outbreak
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Malaysia heaved a sigh of relief, as 2 people under observation for
possible bird flu infection have been cleared of the disease. (For
background on the patients see below. [3])

Malaysia's Health Minister, Chua Soi Lek, pledged that
round-the-clock 24-hour surveillance would continue until the
affected areas are declared free from the H5 N1 virus. Speaking after
the weekly cabinet meeting, he announced that a veterinary worker,
suspected of having bird flu, has been diagnosed as suffering from
acute gastroenteritis instead. The 45-year-old woman, who was
involved in the testing of samples for the bird flu virus, had a
fever and diarrhea.

As for the 10-year-old boy admitted for suspected bird flu, he is now
out of [danger]. The boy had a fever and cough. Mr. Chua said: "His
X-ray is normal. We don't think this is a case of avian flu; we just
want to be more cautious, that's all. Active surveillance is ongoing;
we have inspected 340 houses."

The new outbreak of bird flu, which has killed 27 people across Asia
this year [2004], was found in Belian village, near Pasir Pekan, in
Kelantan, where the 1st outbreak occurred last month [August 2004].
Although there is no case of human infection, the health authorities
are conducting door to door checks around the clock, within the 1km
radius of the affected village, to keep the deadly disease
at bay. More than 2500 people have been screened, and nearly 1400
birds, including chickens, ducks, and pet birds, have been culled.

The authorities believe that the 10 chickens and 20 quail that died
could have eaten the contaminated leftovers of birds smuggled in from
across the border with Thailand. This has prompted the government to
tighten controls at all border checkpoints and to place immediate
restrictions on the movement of birds within a 10 kilometer radius of
the affected areas.

Malaysia's Veterinary Services Department is now in discussion with
Singapore's Agri Food and Veterinary Authorities on allowing poultry
and eggs from selected farms to be imported into Singapore. Kerk Choo
Teng, Malaysian Deputy Minister, Agriculture and Agro-based Industry
Ministry, said: "Singapore requires quite a high standard of safety.
Most of the farms...comply with this high standard of requirement."

Malaysia exports nearly half its poultry, and a third of its eggs, to
Singapore and hopes the island republic will resume imports from
farms in the southern states of Johor and Malacca. A total ban by
Singapore, Japan, and Taiwan, since mid-August 2004, has threatened
the country's 6-billion ringgit [USD 1 579 000 000] poultry industry.

900 chickens, ducks, and birds culled in Kelantan
-------------------------------------------------
Almost 900 chickens, ducks, and birds have been culled, following the
detection of new avian flu cases in Kampung Belian on Sunday [5 Sep
2004]. The village is about 5km from Kampung Pasir Pekan, in
Kelantan, where the virus was 1st detected on 17 Aug 2004.

Veterinary Services Department director-general Datuk Dr. Hawari
Hussein said that the culling activities began on Monday [6 Sep 2004]
night in Kampung Belian, and within a 1km radius of the
area, after 30 chickens and quails, belonging to a villager in
Kampung Belianhad, died from Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI).

A veterinary department worker, a 10-year-old boy, and a teenage girl
from Kampung Belian have been hospitalized for observation, as they
had avian flu-like symptoms, including fever and coughing. [The first 2 have
been excluded as cases -- see above. - Mod.JW]

"As of Tuesday [7 Sep 2004] morning, a total of 888, out of 1200
chickens, ducks, and birds, have been culled. Culling activities are
ongoing for the remaining 300. We can only start the 21-day
disease-free countdown for the area once culling activities have been
completed," he said in a statement yesterday [Tue 7 Sep 2004].

The earlier quarantine, imposed on a 10km radius around Kampung Pasir
Pekan, that includes Kampung Belian, was to have ended tomorrow [Thu
9 Sep 2004]. Although there have been no further cases of HPAI, Dr.
Hawari said that frequent inspections, monitoring, and surveillance
activities would continue within the quarantine areas, and throughout
the country, as a precautionary measure. "No new signs of HPAI have
been detected, and locations outside the 10km quarantine area are
free from the disease," he said, adding that eggs, chickens, and
ducks in the market were still safe for consumption.

Dr. Hawari advised the public, especially those living near the Thai
border, to cooperate with authorities and not bring any poultry, or
related products, into the country. "Poultry and related products
from Thailand are still barred from being brought into the country,"
he added.

Malaysian boy hospitalized, over 1200 chickens destroyed
--------------------------------------------------------
A 10-year-old boy has been quarantined at a hospital, as a
precautionary measure, following the discovery of a new bird flu case
in Kampung Belian, in the east coast town of Tumpat. The new case was
confirmed as H5 bird flu infection by the Veterinary Research
Institute (VRI), in the northern town of Ipoh, last Sunday [5 Sep
2004], local media reported.

Kelantan Health Department Director Dr. Ahmad Razin Ahmad Maher said that the
boy, who lives with his family, was placed in a special ward at 7:30 last
night [6 Sep 2004] after coming down with fever.

The east coast state of Kelantan Veterinary Department, on Monday [6 Sep
2004] night, immediately launched a large-scale operation, culling over 1200
chickens and reared birds, to prevent the spread of H5 avian influenza, or
H5N1.

"So far, only the boy has the fever, but other members of the family,
and the villagers, show no signs of infection," he was quoted as
saying on Tuesday [7 Sep 2004].

Kelantan VSD Director Dr. Idris Kadir said that the operation to cull
poultry, within a 1km radius of the site of infection, began last night [6
Sep 2004] and involved 70 veterinary staff with help from 90 members of the
state health department.
