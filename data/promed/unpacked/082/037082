Tests are being carried out on a further 13 people thought to have
contracted _E. coli_ O157 at a Welsh dance camp. A 9-year-old girl
from Denbighshire and a 43-year-old woman from Essex have been
described as probable cases. Another 11 people who attended the Dance
Camp Wales event in Pembrokeshire have also reported suffering _E.
coli_-like symptoms.

Just 2 children, a 7-year-old girl from Denbighshire, who has been
treated in hospital, and an 11-year-old, who lives in the West
Midlands, have so far been confirmed with _E. coli_ O157. Tests have
revealed that both children have been infected by the same strain of
the disease.

It is thought that the farmland at the Cresselly event could have
been the source of the potentially deadly _E. coli_ O157 infection.

More than 600 people attended the dance festival which ran from 29
Jul 2009 to 9 Aug 2009. Pembrokeshire Council's public protection
department has already made more than 200 phone calls and sent almost
300 e-mail messages to people known to have attended the camp, and is
continuing to contact attendees. The organisers of Dance Camp Wales
are working closely with both the council and the National Public
Health Service (NPHS) to trace everyone who attended the festival.

The incubation period for _E. coli_ O157 can range from 1 to 14 days,
but is characteristically 3 to 4 days. The length of the illness can
vary but people with are usually ill for up to 2 weeks.
