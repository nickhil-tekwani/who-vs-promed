Texas Department of State Health Services 8 Oct 2014 10:23 A.M.
---------------------------
"The past week has been an enormous test of our health system, but for one family it has been far more personal. Today [8 Oct 2014], they lost a dear member of their family. They have our sincere condolences, and we are keeping them in our thoughts. The doctors, nurses and staff at Presbyterian provided excellent and compassionate care, but Ebola is a disease that attacks the body in many ways. We'll continue every effort to contain the spread of the virus and protect people from this threat."

[Dr. David Lakey, Commissioner, Texas Department of State Health Services]

[2] USA: Experts worry Ebola may spread more easily than assumed

Dr. C.J. Peters said he would not rule out the possibility that Ebola spreads through air. "We just don't have the data to exclude it," said Peters...

There is no proof that an infected person without symptoms could not spread the virus. "It's really unclear," said Michael Osterholm, "None of us know."

Health officials say Ebola is spread only through physical contact or bodily fluids. Yet some scientists say such assurances are premature...

[It is impossible for good scientists like Mike and CJ to guarantee what a virus will or will not do. But let's not speculate too much, because the media fuels public paranoia by adding sensational headlines to what we say. The public is quite worried enough already.

It should be obvious that this strain of ebolavirus is NOT currently airborne like the flu, otherwise, there would already be far more cases than there appear to be now.

As for spread by people without symptoms, there is no way to test that without human volunteers and no practical way to avoid that if it in fact ever occurs, other than self-quarantine/isolation. - Mod.JW]

[3] USA: Travel ban?

It seems so obvious: To keep Ebola out of the United States, simply keep anyone who has the deadly disease from getting in...

Many public health experts who oppose the travel ban argue that it's simply not practical. That includes Columbia University's Morse, who describes himself as a "fence-sitter" on the issue but doesn't support a travel ban right now because people with financial means can travel to an intermediate country before entering the United States. West Africa's many porous borders make such travel even easier, he said.

It wouldn't make sense to ban people who fly out of Senegal, where, like the United States, there has been only one case of Ebola, Morse said. But if one person with Ebola made it there [from Guinea], others could, too.

A ban could also encourage people to lie about where they have been, Morse said: "One of the real concerns is that if you outlaw [travel], it will discourage people from coming forth with the truth."

[A ban would be unenforceable. How does an immigration officer know whether a person arriving from Europe has been in an EVD country in the last 3 weeks? Do the airports in the EVD countries stamp passports on exit? In any case, West Africans have visa-free travel to neighboring countries. They could go to any of them that are EVD-free with no entry stamp in their passport and leave from them. Or they may live in Europe or elsewhere overseas and have been on extended travel.

The USA won't allow profiling people of color, although there are other countries that would have no hesitation and aggravate many African-Americans in doing that. In any case, how will you detect dual citizens who depart West Africa on their West African passports and arrive in the US on their unstamped US passports? Or African-Americans who are returning after extended travel through West Africa? It would extend passport examination time enormously, and arriving passengers would self-segregate in the waiting lines, not to mention airline passengers self-segregating in departure lounges and asking to be reseated away from passengers of color on board. The complications multiply.

I read somewhere that the temperature that triggers quarantine for a passenger is 101.5 F. If that is true, the deceased Liberian reportedly had only 101.1 F on his 1st visit to the hospital. - Mod.JW
