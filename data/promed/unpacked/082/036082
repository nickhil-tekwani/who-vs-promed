Florida officials have confirmed Asian soybean rust in 3 maturity
groups of soybeans in a sentinel plot in Martin County. This is the
first occurrence of soybean rust on soybeans planted this season
anywhere in the U.S.
Carrie Harmon of the University of Florida told
there was a 29 percent incidence of rust in
the plot, with the oldest infection being in the Group III soybeans.
She said it then spread to the Group V and then the Group VII in a
pattern similar to that seen in plots in 2005.
The samples were collected by a scout yesterday in the sentinel plot
near Jupiter, Florida, and, since this is the first time for rust in
this southeastern Florida county, the spores were confirmed by PCR
testing -- both conventional and real-time, Harmon said.
While she said this infection is not going to have a major impact on
inoculum levels in the state, given how much lower those levels are
compared to 2005 at this time -- this is the first positive rust find
in the United States since rust was found on 2 Mar 2006, in Miller
County, Georgia. That rust, on kudzu, was found to be growing again
yesterday, also.
Harmon said she was not sure how much rain Tropical Storm Alberto
dumped on Martin County, but she said there was an average of 3
inches of rain across the state during the storm. That still leaves a
moisture deficit of 6 to 8 inches for the year, she said.
"The ground is saturated now, so we're having heavy fog and dew,"
she said. "That could lead to rust development, but it takes at least
7 days" for the resulting infection to be visible. Scouts are and
will be out looking across the state.
The county, which is 3 counties north of Miami-Dade, where rust was
found on kudzu on 13 Feb 2006, is now red on the USDA rust
observation map, and an alert e-mail went out at 4:10 p.m. CDT. The
official state commentary is not yet posted on the site.

[Asian soybean rust(ASR) is a plant disease caused by the fungus
_Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ and was introduced into the USA in 2004. In
addition to the crop plant soybean (_Glycine max_), cowpeas, green
beans, and other edible legumes can be affected by the ASR pathogen,
which causes defoliation and yield reduction. Kudzu (_Pueraria
lobata_, a.k.a. Japanese arrowroot) is an important alternate host
for the pathogen in southern states of the USA.
This posting requires little comment, since it is the awaited first
report of ASR on soybean in the USA 2006 crop season. Not too
surprisingly, it is in Florida. The PCR testing noted in the previous
post in this series was used to confirm the diagnosis. It is noted
that wet storm-related weather is favorable for spread of ASR.

context for 2006 and before.
