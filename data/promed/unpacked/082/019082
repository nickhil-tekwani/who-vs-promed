Reports that a water pool was the likely source of an anthrax outbreak at a
South Wales farm could be a "red herring" according to the expert at the
centre of the investigation. Carwyn Jones, Welsh environment minister, said
the pond was a likely source of the disease which affected 2 animals. But
Dr Christianne Glossop, chief veterinary officer for Wales, was cited as
saying last night that she was not ruling out the possibility that the
contamination could have come from a source over 30 years old.
One of the main suspects is ash left from 7 cows infected with anthrax and
burnt on the farm near Cardiff in 1971. Dr Glossop stressed that although
tests are continuing on samples from the water pool at Ynysgau Farm,
Gwaelod-y-garth, where 2 cows died of anthrax last week, the search for the
source included all areas of the farm.

[In my experience and that of the Canadians, who have been intensively
checking burn sites in the Wood Bison National Park, burning carcasses is
very successful. Thanks to scavengers you can have surface contamination
around and about but it is temporary, and the Welsh 1971 cows would not
have been scavenged by butchering wolves. And by the nature of these things
any remaining contamination would have not waited 30-plus years to reveal
itself. Spores do die -- so any survivors would have been fewer each year.
We have been examining sloughs/shallow areas that collect rain/pot-holes or
"playas" in South Texas and found that in that area of sandy loam -- the
top inch or 2 is almost pure sand and very inimical for spore survival --
that these natural "saucers" not only collect the occasional shower rain
but also calcium and other salts including sodium (as in "salt") in
significant amounts and have a raised pH -- that is, around 6.1 to higher
than 6.5 in an otherwise low pH region, and organic materials. So these
spots, usually 1-2 acres in size, become randomly scattered places where
any _B. anthracis_ spores have a greater chance of survival. Also it is
noticed that sick animals will go there for the shade -- thanks to the
moisture there are trees and thick scrub, and if it has rained shallow
water to cool a fever. If they die there, the carcasses are quickly torn
apart by feral pigs and vultures, ensuring sporulation. Depending on the
month and if the trees are scattered, allowing sunlight in, there is also
excellent grazing there. All in all an ideal anthrax nidus. If the trees
are dense, there is only shade and then they fill with a wild mint, which
neither cattle nor deer will graze. But that is in Texas, not Wales.
A few years ago there was a severe outbreak in Washoe County, Nevada, when
the new owners of a ranch cleaned out the springs and ditches on a place
with a long history of random deaths and earlier anthrax; the previous
owner seldom asked for professional help and advice, and the fields were
full of bones. It was believed that the new owners might in this way have
disturbed one or more old anthrax cases and their cattle became infected by
drinking this contaminated ditch water. But this was a site with probably
very severe contamination just waiting to be stirred up.
In the South African & Namibian national parks blood-covered vultures have
been shown to spread contamination, when after feeding they bathe in small
ponds and cattle/game water troughs, which is logical.
All of which says that Christianne Glossop has a real puzzler. In order to
close off alternative hypotheses, one hopes that they are checking on any
feed or hay given these cows. - Mod.MHJ]
