Avian influenza discovered in Novosibirskaya region (Russia)
-----------------------------------------------
According to the Interfax news agency, avian influenza type H5N1 has
been discovered in migratory birds in the Novosibirskaya region. As
suggested by Alexander Shestopalov, the head of the zoonoses
laboratory in the State Scientific Center for Virology and
Biotechnology "Vector," preliminary data indicate that the virus was
brought from south-east Asia by migratory birds, such as ducks
and geese, which annually winter there.
The analysis of tests of samples obtained from the birds in the
spring and the autumn months is proceeding, with final results
expected in December 2004. Shestopalov stated that the H5N1 virus was
identified in birds sampled last year [2003].
The birds, which probably are carriers of the influenza virus, live
generally in the lowland zone of Barabinsko-Kulundinskoj (Novosibirsk
area), which is known as a crossroads for migrating birds. "It is a
rather sparsely populated area with many lakes; therefore, direct
contact of the carrier birds with people is unlikely," Shestopalov
noted.
Scientists have warned of possible mutations, and genetic
reassortment, of avian and human influenza viruses. They have warned
that conditions for such a scenario might prevail [also] on Russian
territory.

[Waterfowl are known to play a significant role in the spread of influenza A
viruses. Migratory birds were blamed for the outbreaks of bird flu in Asian
countries during the current and previous HPAI outbreaks. First hand details
of the Russian observations, and, specifically, the genetic make-up of
isolates, will be useful, as will details of similar investigations in other
countries to which waterfowl seasonally return from south-east Asia. -
