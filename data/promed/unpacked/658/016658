Anthrax detected in cows in Kerala
---------------------------------------
Anthrax has been detected among cows in the Ernakulam district of
Kerala. The bacterial disease detected among 3 cows belonging to one
owner at Koothattukulam, 50 km away from Cochin, was confirmed by the
Disease Diagnostic Center, Tiruvalla yesterday [22 Jul 2006].
Two teams of surgeons and livestock officials have been rushed to the
village. State Animal Husbandry director Vijayakumar said there was
no cause for any panic, as the department had already taken steps to
prevent the spread of the disease. He told reporters here that the
department had already started administering anthrax spore vaccine to
cattle. He said the state had adequate stocks of vaccine to immunize
the entire cattle population in the state. "We have directed the
district officials to observe the situation in their areas and take
suitable action. They have already been given guidelines on how to
deal with the situation," Vijayakumar said.
Meanwhile, Tiruvalla Disease Diagnostic Center officials said anthrax
in the cows was confirmed after a blood test. They said that the
blood samples they received from Koothattukulam had tested positive.
Ernakaulam district veterinary officials decided to conduct the test
after 2 cows died in quick succession. The blood sample was taken
from a 3rd cow, which also died subsequently.
Kerala was free from anthrax even when it was widely reported from
several places in the neighboring state of Tamil Nadu. The state had
banned movement of cattle from Tamil Nadu whenever anthrax was detected there.

Anthrax detected in Kerala cattle
-------------------------------------
Anthrax, a bacterial disease found primarily in herbivorous domestic
animals, has been detected in the Ernakulam district in Kerala.
[Despite the previous statement of freedom from anthrax in Kerala],
since 1998, isolated incidents of anthrax have been regularly
reported from certain pockets in the state, like Kodungallur and
Mullakkara in Thrissur district and some areas of Palakkad district.
In July 2005, after anthrax was detected in Theni district in
Madurai, of neighboring Tamil Nadu [see ProMED ref. below], the
Kerala government banned the movement of cattle from Tamil Nadu into
Kerala for a brief while. Close to 90 percent of the cattle that come
from Tamil Nadu into Kerala are headed towards slaughter houses in the state.

[OIE reported anthrax in cattle in the following Indian states: Andra
Pradesh, Gujarat, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil
Nadu, West Bengal and Union Territory of Pondicherry. In 1998, India
for some reason did not submit an anthrax report to Paris, nor has
Kerala turned up in the OIE yearly reports after 1999. We did have
one report in 2004. Further details were requested, but nothing
further emerged. If we should have members in Kerala, any background
information on this and other similar outbreaks in the state would be
appreciated. - Mod.MHJ]
