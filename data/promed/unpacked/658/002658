An outbreak of enterovirus infection in Vladivostok
---------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of enterovirus infection has occurred in the city of
Vladivostok. About 300 cases have been registered, 269 of whom are
children. In half of the cases the disease developed into serous (aseptic)
meningitis, which can have serious consequences. Galina Shklyar, the senior
infectious diseases specialist in Vladivostok, said that all the infections
occurred as a consequence of people swimming in the sea around the shores
of the territory.

[Enteroviral infections are common in childhood. The enteroviruses include
numerous strains of coxsackievirus, echovirus, enterovirus, and poliovirus.
Enteroviral infections are most common in communities living in conditions
of poor hygiene.

The infection begins when material contaminated with the virus is
swallowed. The virus then reproduces in the digestive tract. The body's
immune defenses stop many infections at this stage, and the result is few
or no symptoms. Colds and upper respiratory infections are common outcomes
of infection with enteroviruses. Sometimes the virus survives and spreads
into the bloodstream, resulting in fever, headache, sore throat, and, at
times, vomiting.

Serous (aseptic) meningitis affects the membranes covering the brain and
spinal cord (meninges), causing severe headache, stiff neck, and
sensitivity to light. Enteroviral infections usually resolve completely,
but infections of the heart or central nervous system are occasionally fatal.
