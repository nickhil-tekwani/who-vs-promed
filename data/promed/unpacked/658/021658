Ebola situation report - 30 Sep 2015
------------------------------------
Summary
-------
There were 4 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) reported in the week to 27 Sep 2015, all in Guinea. Case incidence has remained below 10 cases per week since the end of July this year [2015]. Over the same period, transmission of the virus has been geographically confined to several small areas in western Guinea and Sierra Leone, marking a transition to a distinct, 3rd phase of the epidemic. Improvements to case investigation and contact tracing, rapid isolation and treatment, and effective engagement with affected communities have all played a part in reducing case incidence to its current low level. A refined phase-3 response coordinated by the Interagency Collaboration on Ebola will build on these measures to drive case incidence to zero and ensure a sustained end to EVD transmission.

Enhanced capacity to rapidly identify a reintroduction (either from an area of active transmission or from an animal reservoir), or re-emergence of virus from a survivor, improved testing and counseling capacity as part of a comprehensive package to safeguard the welfare of survivors, and the increased use of innovative technologies -- from vaccines to rapid diagnostic tests -- are central to the phase-3 response framework.

All 4 confirmed cases reported from Guinea this week had symptom onset in Forecariah, and are registered contacts of a 10-year-old girl who sought treatment in Forecariah after traveling from the Ratoma area of the capital, Conakry. She subsequently died on 14 Sep 2015 in the Forecariah sub-prefecture of Kaliah. Two of the 4 new cases are traditional healers who are reported to have treated the girl. Over 450 contacts are under follow-up in Guinea, including one in the prefecture of N'Zerekore due to the movement of a contact associated with the Ratoma chain of transmission. The majority of contacts (311) are located in Forecariah, with 147 in Conakry. All contacts are associated with the Ratoma chain of transmission. From 28 Sep to 1 Oct 2015, an active case-finding operation is taking place in the Conakry districts of Dixinn and Ratoma, during which approximately 900 households will be visited.

No new confirmed cases were reported from Sierra Leone in the week to 27 Sep 2015, the 2nd consecutive week with zero cases. Over 700 contacts remain under follow-up in Bombali related to the last reported case on 13 Sep 2015. All contacts associated with the Kambia chain of transmission were scheduled to complete follow-up on 28 Sep 2015. Robust surveillance measures are essential to ensure the rapid detection of any reintroduction or re-emergence of EVD in currently unaffected areas.

Guinea
------
A total of 784 samples were tested by 8 operational laboratories in Guinea in the week to 27 Sep 2015. Analyses of the geographical distribution of samples collected indicate that 18 of 34 Guinean prefectures did not collect any samples from either live or dead suspected cases of EVD over the 1-week period.

Liberia
-------
In Liberia, 1373 samples were collected from 100 per cent (15 of 15) of counties in the week to 27 Sep 2015. Laboratory capacity in the country has increased following the opening of a laboratory in Montserrado, bringing the total number of operational laboratories in the country to 4.

Sierra Leone
------------
Over the same period, 1969 samples were collected from 100 per cent (14 of 14) of districts in Sierra Leone and tested by 9 operational laboratories.

Surveillance in the 3 countries will be enhanced in line with the phase-3 response framework.

No new health worker infections were reported in the week to 27 Sep 2015. Since the start of the outbreak, a total of 881 confirmed health worker infections have been reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone; there have been 513 reported deaths (table 5).

28 Sep 2015 Guinea: Health workers slowly struggle to win Guineans' trust to an experimental Ebola vaccine
http://www.ischoolguide.com/articles/27325/20150928/ebola-vaccine-guinea.htm
[Guinea residents are reticent in accepting the new vaccine, VSV-EBOV, assuming the vaccine will worsen the EVD and bring death to more people.]

28 Sep 2015 Liberia: President Sirleaf says Ebola exposed Liberia's weak health system
http://allafrica.com/stories/201509291604.html
[According to President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, "Ebola exposed the deficiencies and weaknesses of our health care system. Strengthening primary healthcare with focus on controlling prevalent diseases (like malaria, cholera) is a critical priority along with the training of communities as 1st responders in containing outbreaks in the future, whether it is Ebola virus disease (EVD) or other diseases unknown at present."]

http://allafrica.com/stories/201509290735.html
[The Acting Operations Manager of the Sierra Leone Social Marketing and Development Agency (SLaDA), William Freeman, disclosed that between May and September 2015 they have trained some 150 sexually active Ebola virus disease (EVD) survivors on condom negotiation skills with their partners, as well as the correct and consistent use of both male and female condoms to prevent transmission of sexually transmitted infections.]

[An interesting interview with Dr Abdul Kamara, the head of Sierra Leone's laboratory services, about an unusual occurrence: mother-baby transmission (transplacental) of the Ebola virus disease (EVD).]

28 Sep 2015 Sierra Leone: CGI commitment: new Ebola survivor services clinic
http://www.directrelief.org/2015/09/cgi-commitment-ebola-survivor-services-bombali-sierra-leone
[Direct Relief and the Medical Research Centre (MRC) -- through a commitment announced at the 2015 Clinton Global Initiative's plenary session -- will establish a new survivors' clinic in the city of Makeni. Once built, the clinic will accept and care for any Ebola survivor from Bombali and the surrounding districts. This is an excellent initiative, much needed in all 3 countries. - Mod.JW]

30 Sep 2015 Questioning the effectiveness of Ebola checkpoints
http://www.sierraexpressmedia.com/?p=75805#sthash.rC47iL23.dpuf
["When I asked the military and police officers deployed at the checkpoint why they allowed the bishop and his entourage to cross the checkpoint [without] washing their hands and going through the thermometer test, they replied that the man was a bishop and should be given concession. Supposing that bishop was carrying Ebola patients to Kenema, he would have simply succeeded in infesting that Ebola-free community with a fresh round of Ebola. If we are being selective in battling Ebola, then I have the justifiable fear that it will be very difficult for us to win the war against the killer viral epidemic."...]

Technology
----------
28 Sep 2015: Johns Hopkins, DuPont join forces to produce improved Ebola protection suit
http://hub.jhu.edu/2015/09/28/hopkins-dupont-ebola-garment-partnership
[Johns Hopkins University and DuPont have signed license and collaboration agreements allowing DuPont to commercialize a personal protective equipment (PPE) garment with innovative features from Johns Hopkins. The PPE design will have a rear zipper and a "cocoon-style" removal process requiring far fewer removal steps to reduce risk of EVD infection. The garment may include an integrated hood with a large clear visor. DuPont intends to have the 1st of these garments available in the marketplace during the 1st half of 2016.]
