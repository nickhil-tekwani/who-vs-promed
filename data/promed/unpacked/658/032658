New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1 ([Maoz Haim]): [Maoz Haim], Yizreel, Hazafon
Date of start of the outbreak: 1 Mar 2019
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 564 / 48 / 0 / 46 / 2

Affected population: The herd is a milking herd. It contained 297 milking cows, 30 dry cows, 232 heifers and 5 calves. In the slaughter house, during a routine slaughter, 3 cows from the farm have shown pathological changes including granulomas in the lungs. Samples were sent to the laboratory at Kimron Institute. Two of the cows have been found with acid resistant bacteria, and samples were sent to the reference laboratory of the Ministry of Health. All the herd has been immediately tested to tuberculin test. 36 cows and 10 heifers were found positive with the test. All the 46 animals were culled, and an autopsy has been conducted to 16 of them. No dramatic lesions have been seen, but 4 of them were found with acid resistant bacteria, which were sent for further investigation.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 8.51 / 0 / 0 / 8.51
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: This event is not connected to the event of tuberculosis reported in February 2019, where the agent was _Mycobacterium caprae_, and was found in an imported calf.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, screening, quarantine, surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone, official destruction of animal products, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, selective killing and disposal, ante and post-mortem inspections, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Kimron Veterinary Institute, Bacteriology Laboratory (national laboratory) / Cattle / bacteriological examination / 6 Mar 2019 / Inconclusive
Ministry of Health, Abu Kabbir Laboratory (National laboratory) / Cattle / Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 1 Apr 2019 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[The information included in the above immediate notification is complementary to that published in ProMED-mail posting 20190319.6374410 ("Bovine tuberculosis - Israel (02): (HZ) cattle, alert, typing pending"). The dairy operation of Kibbutz Maoz Haim (map: http://tinyurl.com/yyyn8otr) has become Israel's 1st bTB outbreak in dairy cattle for 46 years (1973, when bovine TB was declared eradicated after decades of an eradication project based upon the "Test & Slaughter" system).

Israel's dairy cattle are kept exclusively in a zero-grazing system. The last outbreak in grazing cattle was reported in 1999, on the Golan heights.

Until the end of 2014, tuberculin tests were required to be performed in each farm once in 5 years. After the many years of disease absence, it was decided that from 1 Mar 2015, the monitoring and surveillance of bovine TB on the cattle holdings, where periodic tuberculinations were performed by the Veterinarians of the State Field Veterinary Services, would be moved to the sole responsibility of the slaughterhouses. Meat inspection of mammals in Israel's slaughterhouses is, according to state legislation, carried out by official (municipal) veterinarians, not by (accredited) lay meat inspectors as the policy would be in many countries. It is within the framework of the new policy that the current cases have been detected in routinely slaughtered cattle from Maoz-Haim.

Risk analysis of the revised bTB policy is warranted.

Identification of the source of infection is crucial for the efforts to prevent further spread of the zoonotic bacterium. - Mod.AS
