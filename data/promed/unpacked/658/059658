Abstract
--------
Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) or black fever is regarded as one of the health problems in Iraq because of the limited control facilities, especially in marshland regions.

The present study was carried out during the period from September 2019 to July 2020 in southern provinces of Iraq which aimed to evaluate the role of environment effects that increase the incidence of visceral leishmaniasis.

The incidence of VL during the last 5 years was 6.61%, 18.32%, and 75.06% in Basrah, Maysan, and Thi-Qar respectively. The highest number of infections (295) was recorded in Thi-Qar province; all cases were confirmed either by dipstick rk39 test or by bone marrow examination.

The areas of marshlands are regarded as suitable environmental for the growth and reproduction of vectors; the rate distribution of sand flies was 100% in all provinces (p>0.05), while in reservoir hosts there are significant differences (p<0.05) among south provinces.

VL has dynamic epidemiology factors that can change under the influence of climate, ecology, behavior of humans, vectors, and reservoirs. The public health officials in endemic areas should use more than conventional techniques in the diagnosis of VL in children and reservoir hosts.

[Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) are both endemic in Iraq. In the 1990s, during the Gulf War (1991), case numbers of VL and CL peaked with an incidence of 45.5/100 000 population for CL in 1992. The incidence of both forms went down after 2004, but recently, leishmaniasis has again become a rapidly increasing health problem (Alvar J et al. Leishmaniasis worldwide and global estimates of its incidence. PLoS One. 2012; 7(5): e35671; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0035671. Supplement on Iraq: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0035671.s045). The paper also includes maps of CL and VL in Iraq; Basrah and Thi-Qar provinces were not regarded as high risk areas for VL 10 years ago. - Mod.EP
