A comment
--------------
Seems to me that the implications reported in the ProMED posting:
'Ljungan virus, intrauterine fetal death - Sweden, archive number
20090129.0400', should be investigated. If this virus can cause fetal
anomalies in humans, why not particularly in humans handling such
rodents, wild or colonized?

Mammalogists and others who handle rodents may or may not be trained
in taking proper precautions (gown, respirator, gloves). That more
illnesses do not occur among such people may reflect pathogen
transmission peculiarities, titer of pathogen shed, ultraviolet light
exposure/inactivation, seasonality, and many other variables.

Colonized rodents usually are shown to be free of a particular
pathogen (the one in which the investigator is interested) but not
shown to be free of scores of other potential pathogens.

How many pregnant or potentially pregnant female field and laboratory
workers are exposed to rodents? Does anyone know?

Do field and laboratory workers serve as sentinels? Are baseline
samples taken from all such workers? Are those samples then tested
only if the worker develops an illness (too late!)?

Has there ever been a case of fetal abnormality in a female who
worked with wild-caught or laboratory-reared rodents? If so, the
associated institute has a moral and scientific responsibility to
report this. Even one such case is too many.

Sounds like a job for CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention) and similar organizations worldwide.
