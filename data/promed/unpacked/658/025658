An outbreak of Rift Valley fever was confirmed in sheep in the
Mbombela district of Mpumalanga Province in May 2009. No confirmed
human cases have been linked to this outbreak. Small focal outbreaks
of Rift Valley fever have been reported in KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga,
Limpopo, and North West Provinces during 2008-2009.

A total of 17 human cases were confirmed in 2008, and only 3 cases in
2009 to date. All the confirmed cases had occupational exposure to
infected animals and included veterinarians, veterinary students,
farmers and farm workers.

[An outbreak of RVF in South Africa, starting January and proclaimed
as resolved in June 2008, affecting animals in a total of 26 locations
in Mpumalanga, Gauteng, Limpopo, and North West Provinces, was
reported to the OIE last year. Reportedly, cattle and sheep were
vaccinated with a Live RVF vaccine to prevent additional cases. See
summary of the 8 submitted OIE notifications, with map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=6780>.

A solitary outbreak in KwaZulu-Natal was reported in March 2009 -- see
ProMED ref. below.

RVF is endemic in South Africa, initially identified in 1951.
Epizootics occur once in several years, related to climatic
conditions; sporadic cases occur between epizootics. Vaccination
coverage in "peace time" is rather poor: according to the data
available on the WAHID interface, during 2008, a total of 1482 cattle
(out of a population of 11 547 078), namely 0.01 percent, were
vaccinated, as well as 53 goats (out of 5 025 607). No sheep were
vaccinated.

Africa as well as Mod.CP's commentary in ProMED-mail posting
