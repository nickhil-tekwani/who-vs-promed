Ho Chi Minh City health authorities have warned that the number of hand, foot, and mouth disease cases has sharply increased and that the disease may become an epidemic in the near future. Dr. Nguyen Huu Hung, deputy director of the HCMC Health Department's Preventive Health Center, issued the warning in a recent meeting with health centers from 24 districts of the city.

According to the center, 3373 HFMD cases were reported in the city in 2014 as of 9 May 2014, up 28.3 percent since 2013. The disease has spread to 236 out of the 332 wards, communes, and towns across the city, the center said.

At Pediatrics Hospital 2, 8688 children with HFMD were examined in April 2014. Of this number, 478 children received in-patient treatment, double the number of patients in March 2014, Dr. Trinh Huu Tung, head of the General Planning of the hospital, said. In the 1st 11 days of May 2014, the hospital examined 2904 children with HFMD, 194 of whom were hospitalized.

At Pediatrics Hospital 1, Dr. Truong Huu Khanh, head of the Infection Department, said the infirmary has received 60-70 children with HFMD per day over the past several days. Meanwhile, during the 1st 4 months of this year [2014], only a little over 2000 children with HFMD were admitted to the institution for treatment, less than 20 cases per day, said Dr. Le Bich Lien, deputy director of the hospital. In fact, the number of children with HFMD has steadily increased since February 2014 and will continue to rise, Dr. Lien said.

Nationwide, the disease has spread to 62 of the country's 63 localities, affecting more than 17 400 people and killing 2 as of 13 May 2014, the Ministry of Health announced.

In Viet Nam, the most common strain is enterovirus 71 (EV-71), which causes sores in the mouth and blisters on the hands, feet, knees, and buttocks, according to the Health Ministry's Preventive Health Department.

The ministry has requested that authorities at all levels make the following information known to the public: the disease can be transmitted through digestive tracts; there are no vaccines or specific medicines to combat the disease; children under 5 years old are most vulnerable; and the main preventive measures are following hygienic practices in eating, drinking, and living.

In Viet Nam, HFMD occurs throughout the year in most provinces in the country, but the disease is more prevalent from March to May and from September to December every year. Most of HFMD cases are mild, but in some cases, the disease can cause dangerous complications such as encephalitis, meningitis, myocarditis, and acute pulmonary edema.

[As demonstrated in the abstract of an Australian report (McMinn P, Stratov I, Nagarajan L, Davis S: Neurological manifestations of Enterovirus 71 infection in children during an outbreak of Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease in Western Australia. Clin Infect Dis. 2001;32: 236-242), enterovirus 71, 1st described in 1974, can have a variety of potentially fatal neurological complications:

"Enterovirus 71 (EV71) causes epidemics of hand, foot, and mouth disease associated with neurological complications in young children. We report an outbreak of EV71-associated neurological disease that occurred from February through September 1999 in Perth, Western Australia. 14 children with culture-proven, EV71-induced neurological disease were identified. Nine patients (64 percent) developed severe neurological disease; 4 of these patients developed long-term neurological sequelae. Neurological syndromes included aseptic meningitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, acute transverse myelitis, acute cerebellar ataxia, opso-myoclonus syndrome, benign intracranial hypertension, and a febrile convulsion. Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging data indicated that immunopathology was a major factor in the pathogenesis of neurological disease in this outbreak. This finding is in contrast to reports of previous EV71 epidemics in which virus-induced damage to gray matter was the most frequent cause of neurological disease."

Although no commercial EV71 vaccine is yet available, a recent publication suggests a vaccine may be in the offing (Li R, Liu L, Mo Z, et al: An inactivated Enterovirus 71 vaccine in healthy children. N Engl J Med 2014; 370:829-837). The abstract is shown below:

"We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial involving healthy children 6 to 71 months of age in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China. Two doses of an inactivated EV71 vaccine or placebo were administered intramuscularly, with a 4-week interval between doses, and children were monitored for up to 11 months. The primary end point was protection against hand, foot, and mouth disease caused by EV71.

A total of 12 000 children were randomly assigned to receive vaccine or placebo. Serum neutralizing antibodies were assessed in 549 children who received the vaccine. The seroconversion rate was 100 percent 4 weeks after the 2 vaccinations, with a geometric mean titer of 170.6. Over the course of 2 epidemic seasons, the vaccine efficacy was 97.4 percent (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 92.9 to 99.0) according to the intention-to-treat analysis and 97.3 percent (95 percent CI, 92.6 to 99.0) according to the per-protocol analysis. Adverse events, such as fever (which occurred in 41.6 percent of the participants who received vaccine vs. 35.2 percent of those who received placebo), were significantly more common in the week after vaccination among children who received the vaccine than among those who received placebo." - Mod.LL
