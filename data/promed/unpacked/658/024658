Authorities are warning hunters to be on the lookout for bovine tuberculosis (bovine TB) in deer. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources called it an "emerging disease," which has recently affected a large beef herd in Alcona County, Michigan. It's the 73rd cattle herd to be identified with bovine TB in the state since 1998.

Bovine TB is a bacterial disease that also has infected free-ranging whitetail deer in parts of the northeastern Lower Peninsula.

Cattle in Alcona, Alpena, Montmorency, and Oscoda counties must be tested before they are moved off the farm, which can help prevent the illness from spreading.

Assistant state veterinarian Nancy Barr says farmers in that area should do all they can to prevent deer from having contact with cattle feeding and watering areas. Hunters are urged to get their deer tested, even if it looks healthy. When field dressing a deer, here are a few warning signs of bovine TB to look out for:

- Affected animals may have yellow to tan, pea-sized nodules in the chest cavity or lungs.
- Lymph nodes of the head and neck can be swollen and necrotic.
- Lymph nodes in the animal's head usually show infection first. As the disease progresses, lesions may begin to develop on the surface of the lungs and chest cavity.
- In severely infected deer, lesions can sometimes be found throughout the animal's entire body.

[Tuberculosis is circulating in the cattle herds in Michigan. Cattle and cervids (deer, elk) often have contact with cattle. As the hunting season is upon those in many areas, this should serve as a reminder to be on the lookout for unusual things, such as large lymph nodes or necrotic areas or other abnormalities in your animal when field dressing the animal. It should also serve as a reminder to take along some disposable gloves for use during this process. These gloves are a protective measure for you.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease of both animals and humans. Bovine TB, caused by _M. bovis_, can be transmitted from livestock to humans and other animals.

The cooperative federal-state-industry effort to eradicate bovine TB from cattle in the USA has made significant progress since the program's inception in 1917. The disease has nearly been eliminated from the livestock population of the USA. Many consider this one of the great animal- and public-health achievements in the USA. However, our ultimate goal of eradication remains elusive as animal-health officials continue to detect TB sporadically in livestock herds.

Signs
-----
Q. What is bovine tuberculosis (TB)?
A. Bovine TB is a contagious, chronic bacterial disease caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_. The infection commonly involves the lungs, but it may spread to other organs. Animals often don't show signs until the infection has reached an advanced stage.

Q. What animals can it affect?
A. Bovine TB primarily affects cattle, but it can be transmitted to any warm-blooded animal, including people.

Q. What are the clinical signs of bovine TB?
A. Bovine TB is difficult to diagnose with clinical signs alone. In the early stages of TB, clinical signs are not visible. In later stages, clinical signs may include: emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade fever, and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. Lymph nodes may also be enlarged.

Q. What should I do if my animals show these clinical signs?
A. If you suspect TB in your herd, you should isolate the animal immediately and then call your veterinarian for a proper diagnosis.

Q. How does TB get into cattle herds
A: TB can be introduced into a herd by infected animals or people. In the USA, the 2 most common methods of introduction are

- the purchase of or exposure to infected cattle; or
- the exposure to infected free-ranging wildlife.

The bacterium that causes bovine TB is found in the saliva of infected animals and spreads through airborne particles from the respiratory tract. The bacteria can also spread through feed or watering sites contaminated with saliva and other bodily discharges (urine, manure) or by drinking raw, unpasteurized milk from infected animals. The risk of exposure is greatest in enclosed areas, such as in barns with poor ventilation.
