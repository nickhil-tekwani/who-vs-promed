Nearly half of the 52 people who are known to have died since mid-1995 from
variant Creutzfeld Jakob Disease (nvCJD) were in their 20s.
Junior health minister Lord Hunt of Kings Heath disclosed 23 people had
died aged 20 to 29, 14 had been in their 30s, eight had been aged 10 to 19,
four were in their 50s, and three were in their 40s. There were no recorded
fatal cases of nvCJD - the human equivalent of mad cow disease - of people
aged over 59 or under 10, the minister added.
Lord Hunt published a list showing, in each case, the month the symptoms
began, the month of death, and month nvCJD was confirmed. The list shows 3
deaths occurred in 1995, 10 in 1996, 10 in 1997, 17 in 1998, 11 last year,
and 1 so far this year.
Lord Hunt added there were no cases recorded as having arisen as a
consequence of medical or surgical intervention.
