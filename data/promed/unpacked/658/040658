A great patron of microbiology. Tribute to Jacques F Acar
---------------------------------------------------------
COVID-19 has just claimed an enormously important victim. The world has lost an infectious disease giant, struck down by this apocalyptic virus. It was on his return to France, after a final congress in the United States, that Jacques Acar was hospitalized on [Sat 20 Mar 2020] and became the victim of a rapid evolution of disease which would prevail a week later. After a life entirely dedicated to the fight against microbes, it was a virus that took him.

Jacques Fouad Acar was a great patron of microbiology and infectious diseases in France and around the world. Born in Dakar to Lebanese parents, originally from Deir el-Qamar, he came briefly to Lebanon to finish his secondary studies at the Notre-Dame de Jamhour College before going to settle permanently in France to study medicine. He took his 1st steps in microbiology research at the Institut Pasteur with Professor Yves Chabert and then at Harvard Medical School with Professor Maxwell Finland.

In 1972, he became head of the research unit on antibiotic resistance at the Broussais-Hotel-Dieu faculty of medicine at the Pierre-et-Marie-Curie University in Paris, then head of the clinical microbiology department in affiliated hospitals, notably Saint-Joseph Hospital, Broussais and Hotel-Dieu de Paris. Author of countless publications, he has contributed significantly to the training of a large number of infectious disease specialists and microbiologists around the world, including many from Lebanon. He made it a point of honor to regularly have at least one Lebanese individual in his service!

The staff of the microbiology laboratory listened to his booming voice. Whenever he sometimes commented in a baritone caliber about problems at work, I would hear the staff say in a low voice, "Ah! This is his Lebanese character!" His contributions to knowledge in clinical microbiology and antibiotic resistance alone would constitute a volume!

He insisted on a multinational, pan-European collaboration between France and the Arab and Mediterranean countries, the countries of the Far East and especially with America. He participated in the founding of the European Society of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology (ESCMID), the International Society for Infectious Diseases (ISID), the Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antibiotics (APUA) and the European Group for Antibiotic Resistance.

His obsession with fighting antibiotic resistance persisted after his retirement. He was appointed professor emeritus at Pierre-et-Marie-Curie University, but he continued to work as a consultant to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) because he was convinced of the role of abuse of antibiotics in the animal world as the main factor in the selection of resistant germs.

In addition to his genius in microbiology and infectious diseases, Jacques Acar was a man of colossal culture, able to discuss any subject relating to politics and history, theater, painting, and music. Passionate about everything and seeing his superb baritone voice, he took opera lessons and sang in a choir.

Jacques Acar is a loss for the world of microbiology and infectious diseases, a loss difficult to replace. Certainly, no one is irreplaceable. But Jacques Acar will remain in the heart of his family, of his students and of all those who knew him from far or near as a citizen of the world, a family, cultural and scientific light difficult to extinguish.

It is with a heavy heart that I learned about the passing of Professor Jacques Acar on [Thu 26 Mar 2020] following acquisition of COVID-19. Deepest condolences and sympathies are extended to his family and friends during these sad times.

Dr Acar was professor emeritus of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France. He was senior expert at the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Paris, France, and trained at the Pasteur Institute (Prof Y Chabbert) and at Harvard Medical School (Prof M Finland). Since 1972 he served as chief of the research unit on antimicrobial resistance at the Ecole de Medecine "Broussais -Hotel- Dieu" Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris.

Professor Acar was founder member and former president of the ISID (International Society of Infectious diseases) and the ESCMID (European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases).

I have known Jacques over the past decade as a colleague and a friend through our meetings and conferences. He was highly supportive and friendly all through our encounters. He enjoyed a pleasant personality and interacted in a professional and respectful way with his peers. Our social gatherings over dinners in all these events were pleasant and entertaining and, at the same time, enriching with discussions not only on microbiology and infectious diseases but also on various cultural aspects related to history, arts, music and other. I was deeply saddened by his passing but consoled by his life that he lived abundantly by spreading graciously his enriching knowledge to the world.

The ProMED family and scientific community have lost a great member and leader in Infectious Diseases and Antimicrobial Resistance. Prof Acar will be dearly missed. May his soul rest in peace in God's safe hands.

I was saddened to learn that my dear friend Jacques Acar has fallen victim to COVID-19.

Jacques was one of the founders of the ISID and he remained actively involved long after his 15 years of service on the Executive Committee. As ISID's first treasurer he was responsible for the financial well being of the infant organisation from 1983-1988. In 1988 he became the 2nd president of the ISID and further strengthened the organization by virtue of the tremendously successful congress held in Montreal in 1990.

Following his presidency he continued his service as treasurer until 1998 a period which saw the society grow and establish itself as the pre-eminent worldwide infectious disease organisation. Much of this growth was made possible by his tireless efforts in solidifying the financial base of the ISID.

Jacques continued his support of the ISID for an additional 20 years. From 1998 until at least my retirement in 2017 he was a regular contributor the ISID programs and a resource to me in trying to maintain ISID's financial stability. He visited the office regularly and was always available to ISID's program directors and staff.

I shall miss his warmth and genuine concern for all of us.

Jacques was a wonderful person who used his skills and knowledge to make the world better. I will miss his keen insight, wise counsel and warm friendship.

[I've known Jacques through the years predominantly at international meetings. He was a strong supporter of ProMED and of the IMED meetings. He was always a bright shining star, loaded with great ideas and pushing them forward into initiatives. He would always come to me with suggestions on how things could be improved and enhanced at ProMED and at the particular meeting. And would encourage networking with his extensive global network, making regular introductions.

His loss will be felt globally as well as personally.

Adding my sincerest condolences to his wife, his family, his friends and colleagues. - Mod.MPP]

I first met Jacques when I was a 4th year medical student. One of my mentors, Sherry Gorbach, reached out to Jacques to arrange an "away" rotation for me at Saint Joseph Hospital in Paris. It was a wonderful experience that I will never forget. Jacques and I reconnected when I joined ProMED in 2002. He has been a source of knowledge and wisdom and a strong supporter of ProMED, and in particular for the International Meeting on Emerging Diseases and Surveillance (IMED), which began in 2007. Jacques helped organize the original meeting and has been on the Scientific Advisory Committee ever since. He was a strong proponent of One Health and worked to engage with OIE in IMED and bring AMR to the forefront.

Jacques called me less than 2 weeks ago, while he was in Providence, RI, to urge that IMED continue despite (and because of) the current pandemic.

I want to extend my sympathy to his wife, his family, his friends and many colleagues. - Mod.LM
