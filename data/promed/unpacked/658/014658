I certainly respect Andrews and Langmuir, both of whom I knew and worked
with. However, public health and preventive medicine are dynamic fields
that continue to evolve as we continue to work on disease control and
prevention measures. If we continue to use the term eradication as Andrews
and Langmuir discussed it, we are faced with using a word that today has
two meanings.
Using it one way, all control/prevention measures can be stopped, while
with the other use these measures can be reduced but not stopped. One word
with two different meanings. Is this our current thinking? A recent
reference, CDC -MMWR- Vol.48-Supplement December 31,1999 "Global Disease
Elimination and Eradication as Public Health Strategies" gives definitions
on Page 24 that I believe have been agreed upon as the correct definitions
for these terms. Eradication is understood to mean that transmission no
longer is occurring anywhere in the world and all control/prevention
measures can be stopped while elimination means that there are areas in
which the disease is no longer being transmitted, but since transmission is
still occurring, control/prevention measures need to be continued, though
possible at a reduced rate but not totally stopped. I am sure we are all
working towards the same goal, but we need to give the same interpretation
to the terms we use.

[I thought this was old news; apparently not. If Phil Brachman and D.A.
Henderson cannot agree on these definitions, I guess we will need a
symposium to settle the matter. How about Aruba, next January? Meanwhile,
we accept the C.D.C. definition (vide supra) and cut this string. - Mod. CHC
