The Dominican Republic has registered 4089 dengue cases with 18
deaths, so the authorities announced today [1 Jul 2010] the
initiation of control actions and the elimination of the breeding
sites of the mosquito that transmits the disease [virus], which will
be carried out this weekend.

The number of [dengue] cases has increased since this past May
[2010], when there were 2600 ill people (350 with DHF) and a total of
16 deaths. A spokesperson from the Ministry of Public Health said
that 600 of the 4089 ill individuals contracted DHF, the most serious
form of the disease, which can be fatal. Health authorities are
investigating another 6 deaths to determine if they were caused by
the disease. One of the areas most affected [by dengue] in the
country is the city of Santiago (North), where 7 [dengue] deaths have
been registered so far this year [2010], 6 of whom are children, with
a total of 800 infected individuals confirmed by the local
[officials] of the Ministry of Health.

The Director of the Santiago Regional Pediatric Hospital, Rosa Morel,
said that since January up to June of this year [2010], there were
724 patients admitted to hospital, of whom 324 were considered
serious and specifically, 6 died between May and June 2010. According
to what she said, dengue cases increased in the area in comparison
with 2009, but underscored that the problem became worse in May 2010
due to the abundant rains that were recorded.

The province Public Health Director in Santiago, Ramon Martinez
Henriquez, indicated that among the actions scheduled for this
weekend are included trash collection, fumigation and community
education. The epidemiologist Aulio Collado Anico said that
fumigation of the neighborhoods of greatest incidence will not result
in anything if the underlying causes are not eliminated. Collado
Anico stated that the authorities of the Public Ministry are hiding
reality, because they are not counting the deaths that are registered
in private health centers and some hospitals of the state. The
physician stated that Santiago suffers a real dengue outbreak and
said that if serious and effective actions are not taken, the
situation could become an undesirable disaster.

The Ministry of Social Welfare reported that the dengue epidemic has
declined significantly in 18 departments [state or province
equivalents] in the country, including in La Guajira. The average
weekly reporting decreased from 5000 cases to 3000, representing a
reduction of 60 percent. Similarly, the lethality is maintained at
1.4 percent, which is lower than that expected, according to
estimates by the World Health Organization, WHO (2.5 percent). This
is due to the effectiveness in implementing the contingency plans,
the adherence to guidelines for case management, and the protocols
for action put in place by local authorities, EPS [Entidad Promotora
de Salud -- Health Promotion Organization] and IPS [health care
organizations].

It is important to note that this health situation has tested the
monitoring system of the country, capturing a greater number of
cases, with their respective confirmations, which also shows that
information systems have improved and that the figures are real.

So far, 63 percent of patients have consulted a doctor in the 1st 3
days of onset of symptoms, thus reducing the risk of complications.
That is why the Ministry of Social Protection calls on the population
residing in localities below 1800 meters [5800 feet] above sea level
so that when they have the warning signs and symptoms compatible with
dengue, such as fever, muscle aches, nausea, pain behind the eyes and
headache, or belong to any of the groups at risk, they seek immediate
medical attention at the nearest [health] assistance center.

confirmed cases remains very high, with a rate of positive samples
(of 50-60 percent) and numerous consultations for dengue [illnesses]
conducted by SOS doctors and adult and pediatric emergency services
of Fort-de-France. Most municipalities are affected.

Hospitalizations: 43 confirmed [dengue] cases have been hospitalized

The Office of Disease Prevention and Control 5 Nakorn Rachasima
Director, Dr. Somchai Tungsupachai, revealed the situation of dengue
infection in Thailand, reported by the Bureau of Epidemiology,
Ministry of Public Health. There were 26 185 dengue infection cases
nationwide and 30 fatalities between January 2010 and 26 Jun 2010.

In public health area 14, which consists of Nakhon Ratchasima, Buri
Ram, Surin, and Chaiyaphum provinces, there were 2543 cases and 2
fatalities due to dengue infection between January 2010 and 26 Jun
2010. The highest number of cases was reported from Nakhon Ratchasima
with 948 cases and one death -- an 8-year-old boy who died in March
2010 -- followed by Surin with 849 cases and no deaths reported, and
Buri Rum with 532 cases and one death -- a 19-year-old mother with a
9-month-old baby -- and Chaiyaphum with 214 cases and no deaths
reported.

Mr. Apirat Sokampang, chief of Vector Borne Infectious Diseases,
office of disease control 5, stated that the number of dengue
infection cases in 4 provinces of lower northeastern Thailand
increased by 1-2 times compared to the same period in 2009. The

whereas the highest number of cases was reported in Nakhon Ratchasima
(948 cases and one death); the majority of cases were reported in
Muang district (228 cases), Dan Khun Thot (79), and Sikhio (18).
Blood samples from the death case were sent for examination at the
Medical Science center, Nakhon Ratchasima. The laboratory results
showed the patient was infected with dengue types 2 and 3, which
caused the severe disease and eventually led to death.

For prevention strategies, the office of disease control 5 set up
SRRTs (surveillance rapid response teams) in these 4 provinces; 4
teams at provincial level (one team per province) and a total of 80
teams at district level. Mr. Apirat alerts people to destroy any
possible mosquito breeding sites around their residences, to sleep
under mosquito bed nets, to wear repellent, and to immediately see a
doctor if they become ill and suspect dengue fever.

From January to last Tuesday [29 Jun 2010], 80 dengue deaths were
recorded, an increase compared to 62 deaths in the same period last
year [2009], Health Minister Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai said. He said
that 23 626 cases were recorded so far this year [2010] compared to

"We need to give serious attention to dengue fever because the number
of fatalities is on the increase," he told reporters after visiting
the Penang Hospital here today [1 Jul 2010]. He said that public
apathy towards seeking immediate treatment was among the factors for
the hike in casualties. "I hope the public will seek medical
treatment if dengue symptoms are present, and I have also instructed
all doctors to immediately treat dengue patients," he said.

Liow reminded the public take precautionary measures such as ensuring
cleanliness in their homes.

A total of 6 people were killed by dengue fever out of 910 people
infected with the disease in Myanmar's Yangon in the 1st 5 months of
2010, a statistical report of the Yangon City Development Committee
said on Tuesday [29 Jun 2010]. Noting that the disease occurrence
rate is growing higher, as the rainy season set in in June 2010, a
disease sensitive month, 88 people have been infected with the
disease in the 1st week of the month, it said. According to an
earlier report, the number of people infected with dengue fever in
the whole of 2009 amounted to 3129 with 37 deaths registered.

Meanwhile, the health authorities have been stepping up preventive
measures against dengue fever in the Yangon municipal area, targeting
a coverage of every township starting this year [2010] by introducing
abate medicine [larvicide] with better effect.

In June last year [2009], dengue fever once broke out in 2 populated
suburban townships of Dagon Myothit (North and South) and
Hlaingtharya in Yangon division, affecting children of 5 years of age
and above. The Myanmar health department, in cooperation with U.N.
organizations and domestic non-governmental organizations, then
launched a USD 700 000 anti-dengue-fever campaign in 11 townships in
Yangon and Ayeyawaddy divisions.

Dengue fever once reached a critical stage of level-3 in 2007,
killing 100 out of 15 000 people infected with the disease [virus],
said the anti-malaria department, adding that such an occurrence
happens once a decade.

Dengue fever usually breaks out in Yangon, Bago, Sagaing, Ayeyawaddy,
Mon and Mandalay divisions and states, especially in the rainy
season, which falls in the months of June, July, August and September.

The health authorities have occasionally advised people to take
necessary measures to prevent and control the disease, including
hygienic use of drinking water, combating larvae, week-end sanitation
activities and education talks on dengue fever, which [virus] is
spread by a species of mosquito active during the day.

Following an epidemic of dengue in the Comores, the surveillance of
dengue in La Mayotte was stepped-up in March 2010. This surveillance
rested on laboratory virological tests by the CHM (Centre Hospital de
Mayotte). [There is] an active search for sick people in the
neighborhood, highlighting any probable or confirmed cases of dengue
not reported to the agents of the anti-vectorial (AVL) (Campaign) and
tracking the number of suspicious cases seen by physicians in the
sentinel surveillance network and also in the CHM emergency
department and by the monitoring of the distribution of antipyretic
drugs sold by the sentinel network of pharmacies.

Results of Virologic Surveillance
----------------------------
From 23 Jun 2010, the laboratory at the CHM had confirmed 49 cases of
dengue from a total of 666 analyses done since the beginning of March
2010. There have been 10 new cases since 9 Jun [2010]. The number of
RT-PCR analyses is about the same, (remains stable). The total of
positives is variable, passing 3.2 percent in [epidemiological] week
24 from 14.3 percent in the preceding week.

Descrtiption of the Cases
----------------------
All the confirmed cases are locally acquired, giving a total of 24
indigenous cases. In addition to the indigenous cases, [there were]
20 imported cases; 3 of these have "fallen from view," and 2 were
indigenous cases, making a total of 49 cases confirmed since March
2010. The number of probable [suspected] cases is 23, 20 indigenous
plus 3 imported. The cases are dispersed all over the island. The 1st
group of cases was at Passamainty in the suburbs and a small cluster
of 2 confirmed cases and one probable case in Mtsangamouji.

In week 24, 3 people with dengue have been hospitalised, but they
have not developed the serious or hemorrhagic form of the disease.
Since the start of the circulation of the virus on the island, no
serious form of fever has been registered. There have been no deaths.
