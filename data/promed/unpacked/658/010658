Amid propaganda against the polio vaccine and refusal by parents to inoculate their children against the virus, 4 more polio cases have been diagnosed in Pakistan. Not a single of the victims had been vaccinated against the disease during immunization campaigns. According to a notification of the National Institute of Health (NIH), Islamabad, 2 of the 4 children with polio virus hailed from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa while others 2 from Balochistan.

Polio virus was confirmed in 2.5 years-old child from Union Council Haveed of District Bannu and another one year-old girl from UC Janikhel also reported to polio virus. Two kids from Jaffarabad and Qila Abdullah districts of Balochistan were also affected from polio virus.

With the latest addition, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, including the newly merged tribal districts, shares 25 of the total 41 cases reported across the country so far this year [2019], while 2 cases from Sindh, 3 from Punjab and 8 cases reported from Baluchistan. In a sharp contrast, last year [2018] 12 cases were reported from across the country and only 8 in 2017.

[The above media report is confirmed on the End Polio Pakistan website with the total number of cases of WPV1 confirmed with date of onset since 1 Jan 2019 in Pakistan now at 41. This is the highest number of annual cases reported since 2015 when there were 50 cases reported (http://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-in-provinces. While the 2 cases reported from Balochistan are the 1st cases confirmed for this year, it is not surprising as there have been positive environmental samples reported during the course of the year (2019). See section [3] below for an example of the social impact the vaccination activities have had on the population.

Pakistan
- 5 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases have been confirmed: 2 from Torghar district, 2 from Bannu district, and 1 from North Waziristan in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The cases had an onset of paralysis on [28 May 2019], [12 Jun 2019], [10 Jun 2019] and [11 Jun 2019] respectively, bringing the total number of WPV1 cases to 32. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 remains 12.
- 18 WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week: 1 each from South Waziristan, Bannu, D.I Khan, and Mardan districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province; 1 each from Hyderabad and Kambar districts, and a sample each from S.I.T.E, Baldia Town, Saddar, and 2 from Gadap Town, Karachi district, Sindh province; 2 from Rawalpindi district and 3 from Lahore district, Punjab province; 1 each from Quetta and Pishin districts in Balochistan province. The samples were collected between [28 May 2019] to [17 Jun 2019].

Nigeria
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 has been reported in the past week. There are 9 cVDPV2 cases reported in 2019 so far. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 remains 34.
- 5 cVDPV-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week: 3 in Sokoto North, Sokoto State; 1 in Apapa, Lagos State; 1 each in Ilorin East and Ilorin West. The samples were collected between [13 Mar 2019] to [27 May 2019].
- Recent confirmation of spread of 1 of the cVDPV2 outbreaks, both within Nigeria and internationally, underscores the urgent need to fill remaining vaccination gaps in the ongoing outbreak response, and to optimize the geographic extent and operational quality of mOPV2 response.

Lake Chad Basin
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported in the past week.
- In the Lake Chad region, cVDPV2 linked to the outbreak originating in Nigeria has been detected in Niger (one case in 2019 and 10 cases in 2018), and Cameroon (one positive environmental sample, collected on [20 Apr 2019] in Extreme Nord).
- The risk of further cVDPV2 spread across the Lake Chad subregion remains high.

Central Africa
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC):
- 1 case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported this week in the DRC in Kasai province, Kamonia district, with onset of paralysis on [28 May 2019] bringing the total number of cVDPV2 cases to 6. The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported in 2018 was 20. DRC is currently affected by 6 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, in the provinces of Haut Katanga; Mongala; Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri, Sankuru and Kasai (2).

Angola:
- 1 case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported this week in Angola in Kuvango district, Huila province, on [10 May 2019] and 4 cVDPV2 isolated from healthy community contacts collected on [4 Jun 2019].
- This is the 2nd cVDPV2 outbreak in Angola this year [2019]; the earlier outbreak was detected in Lunda Norte province; for which an outbreak response is in progress (in close coordination with DRC).
- The Ministry of Health and local health authorities are undertaking a detailed investigation and the partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) are providing support as required. A full epidemiological and virological field investigation is ongoing to ascertain the source and origin of the isolated virus including; active surveillance is being strengthened; subnational population immunity levels are being analysed; and, outbreak response is being planned.
- Given cross-border population movements, subnational immunity and surveillance gaps, Lunda Norte province is considered at high-risk for further transmission of the isolated cVDPV2. It is critical that an emergency, preventive outbreak response now be fully implemented in the province. In absence of a timely and high-quality vaccination response, there is imminent risk of further transmission of this cVDPV2, potentially leading to a significant outbreak of paralytic polio. Two preventive emergency outbreak response campaigns with mOPV2 are planned in Lunda Norte province, to be synchronized with campaigns in neighbouring areas of DR Congo, to interrupt any potential cross-border circulation.

Horn of Africa
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported in the Horn of Africa.
- The current outbreak is linked to an ongoing cVDPV2 outbreak detected in the Horn of Africa in 2018, with cases reported in Somalia as well as from an environmental sample in Kenya. Separately, Somalia is also affected by a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3) outbreak.
- 3 cVDPV2 virus have been isolated from a contact case in Doolo/Warder, Somali State, Ethiopia, and were reported on [29 May 2019].
- Somalia has reported a total of 15 cVDPV cases (8 type 2, 6 type 3 and 1 coinfection of both type 2 and type 3) since the beginning of the outbreaks. The most recent cVDPV3 virus was from an AFP case from Runingod district, Middle Shabelle province with an onset date of paralysis on [7 Sep 2018]. Circulating VDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in 1 environmental sample in Kenya collected on [21 Mar 2018].
- Since detection of the cVDPVs in the Horn of Africa in 2018, Ethiopia had declared the outbreaks - together with the Ministries of Health of Kenya and Somalia - to be a regional public health emergency and has been participating in regional outbreak response.
- Given cross-border population movements across the Horn of Africa and subnational immunity and surveillance gaps, Somali province is considered at high-risk of further transmission of this isolated cVDPV2.
- The Ministry of Health and local health authorities are undertaking a detailed investigation and the partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) are providing support as required. A full epidemiological and virological field investigation is ongoing; active surveillance is being strengthened; subnational population immunity levels are being analysed; and, outbreak response is being planned.
- This event further underlines the risk of cVDPV2 across the Horn of Africa.

Papua New Guinea
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 remains 26.
- The most recent cVDPV1 virus was isolated from an environmental sample collected in the National Capital district on [6 Nov 2018].
- A GPEI Outbreak Response Assessment reviewed the impact of current outbreak response and concluded that overall strong response had been implemented. Commending national and subnational public health authorities and health workers on their efforts, the Assessment team underscored the need on now filling any residual subnational surveillance and immunity gaps.
- The team reviewed all aspects of the response, and noted significant efforts and improvements, including on service delivery, surveillance strengthening, data analysis, cold chain/reverse cold chain refurbishment, vaccine acceptance and community engagement, health worker engagement, collaboration with neighbouring Indonesia and outreach to remote areas/communities. In particular, the group noted the strong collaboration between outbreak response and strengthening of routine immunization, including through systematic collaboration with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and highlighted that this model of working should be replicated in other outbreak settings.

Mozambique
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreak has been reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 remains one.
- In addition to the confirmed case, the same virus was also isolated from 2 healthy community contacts, reported on [10 and 17 Dec 2018].
- The GPEI and partners are working with country counterparts to support the local public health authorities in conducting a field investigation (clinical, epidemiological and immunological) and thorough risk assessment to discuss planning and implementation of immunization and outbreak response.

Indonesia
- No circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) cases were reported this week.
- In total, 3 genetically-linked circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) isolates were detected from Papua province: a cVDPV1 from an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case, with onset of paralysis on [27 Nov 2018], and 2 cVDPV1 isolates from healthy community contacts, collected on [24 Jan 2019 and 13 Feb 2019]. This outbreak is not linked to the cVDPV1 currently affecting neighbouring Papua New Guinea.
- The 2nd polio immunization response round has been extended in Papua province to give the opportunity for districts to vaccinate and protect more children. Lessons learnt from the special operations being deployed in Yahukimo district, the epi-centre of the outbreak, have been shared with other high-risk districts with hard to reach populations. These districts attended a meeting in Jayapura on [21 Jun 2019] chaired by the Papua Provincial Health Office (PHO). The meeting has re-energized local health authorities who have signed a Declaration of Commitment to increase coverage and release local funds to support enhanced operations.
- To support these districts in the coming weeks, PHO, WHO, UNICEF and PAEI have developed a joint monitoring plan with senior consultants and staff identified and tasked to provide direct support to each district. A health centre analysis of Puskesmas with the largest numbers of unvaccinated children is being used to target this additional support most efficiently ensuring as well that functional cold chain equipment is in place.
- The Coordinating Ministry for Human Development and Cultural Affairs, met on [27 Jun 2019] in Jakarta with the Ministry of Health, the Home Affairs Ministry, The President's Office, military and police representatives, WHO, UNICEF, ITAGI and other stakeholders to discuss progress towards implementing Indonesia's polio outbreak response. A number of important recommendations have been agreed which will help address remaining bottlenecks and widen support for quality operations.

Iran
- In total, 3 WPV1-positive environmental samples have been reported in 2019, all from Sistan and Balochistan province. The isolated viruses have been detected in environmental samples only, and genetic sequencing confirms they are linked to WPV1 circulating in Karachi, Pakistan
- The Ministry of Health and local health authorities are undertaking a detailed investigation and the partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) are on standby to provide support as required. An immediate risk assessment suggests that this event has limited public health implications, given Iran's very high levels of routine immunization coverage and strong disease surveillance. However, this event further underlines the risk of international spread of WPV1 from Pakistan/Afghanistan.

[The weekly report shows the continued circulation of WPV1 in Pakistan and Afghanistan as evidenced by the confirmation of new cases of AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) associated with infection with the WPV and continued positive environmental samples, fairly widespread circulation in Pakistan. A similar picture is seen with respect to cVDPV (circulating vaccine derived poliovirus) with new outbreaks being identified (DR Congo and Angola) and positive environmental samples).

There are 14 countries that have had documentation of poliovirus circulation in the past 12 months either through positive AFP cases or positive environmental samples. Enough said here.

[3] Pakistan - parental differences on vaccination - media report
Date: Fri 5 Jul 2019
Source: Vaccine confidence Project, a The Times UK report [edited]
https://www.vaccineconfidence.org/pakistan-husband-divorces-wife-for-vaccinating-their-family-against-polio/


A woman who was divorced by her husband for having their children inoculated against polio has condemned the "anti-vax" campaign that is sweeping Pakistan. [The 26 year old woman], was at home with her children when a vaccination team arrived in the area, on the outskirts of Karachi 2 weeks ago. Her husband was at work but had left strict instructions that the children were not to receive the vaccine. "He had often fought with me about vaccinations. He said they were suspicious and damaged children's health," [she] said.

Rumours have spread like wildfire across Pakistan in recent weeks, fuelled by a series of lurid videos posted on social media claiming that scores of children who had taken polio drops during a recent vaccination drive had fallen ill soon afterwards and died. Health clinics were set on fire and thousands of families have refused to let their children be vaccinated as a result, frustrating a government push to declare Pakistan polio free.

[This woman] had not been swayed by the panic and, unknown to her husband, she had already had their 4-year-old son, and their 9-month-old daughter vaccinated at her parents' house against other diseases. When the polio team knocked at her door, she immediately ushered them inside.

"My main concern is the health of my children. My daughter is getting weaker and I could not skip the polio vaccination drops out of fear of my husband," she said. This time, though, she could not conceal her deception: the polio team marked the children's fingers with indelible ink. When [her husband] came home and realised what had happened he flew into a rage and divorced her on the spot, the husband said, using the "triple talaq" practice that grants a Muslim man instant divorce by saying the word "talaq" -- divorce in Arabic -- 3 times. [She] and her children were thrown out of the house.

Pakistan is 1 of only 3 countries where polio has not been wiped out, along with Afghanistan and Nigeria. Despite a vaccination drive that has reached almost 40 million children this year [2019], there have been at least 37 confirmed polio cases, almost triple the number recorded last year [2018].

Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have pulled down at least 200 videos falsely claiming that hundreds of children died after vaccinations. However, Islamist militants are still attacking vaccination teams, believing them to be a conspiracy to sterilise Muslim children or a cover for western spy agencies. The Pakistani vaccination drive was halted for several days after a health worker and 2 police officers guarding her were shot and killed in May [2019].

Now living at her mother's house, [the woman] said that [her husband] was "pleading to come back, but our relationship is over, according to Islam. I support the vaccination campaign against this crippling disease. It is vital for the children. I will not take any risks with my children's health."

[The above article is an example of what is driving the anti-vaccination movement in terms of the impact of social media and the personal toll it is taking in households in Pakistan (and one suspects elsewhere around the world where the antivaccination movement has taken hold). A very sad state of affairs. And while the impact of this movement has been demonstrated clearly this year with the rise of measles cases globally, one shouldn't ignore the impact it is having on polio transmission around the world, with an almost doubling of the number of cases of WPV1 during 2019 to date, and the increasing number of countries demonstrating cVDPV during the past 12 months. - Mod.MPP]
