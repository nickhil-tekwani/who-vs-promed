Contagious equine metritis [CEM], United States of America
----------------------------------------------------------
Information received on (and dated) 30 Dec 2008 from Dr John
Clifford, Deputy Administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Washington, United
States of America

Summary
Report type: follow-up report no. 1
Start date: 10 Dec 2008
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 15 Dec 2008
Report date: 30 Dec 2008
Date submitted to OIE: 31 Dec 2008
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 30 Dec 2006
Causal agent: _Taylorella equigenitalis_
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

Outbreaks: there are no new outbreaks in this report

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: a comprehensive epidemiological
investigation continues to be conducted by Kentucky Department of
Agriculture and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
officials. The epidemiological investigation is tracing all shipments
of semen from the affected stallions and all horses, which visited
the affected index premises since the arrival of the positive
stallions.
As of 30 Dec 2008, the summary of events is as follows:

15 Dec 2008: on routine testing for export of semen a 16-year-old
stallion Quarter Horse was confirmed culture positive for _Taylorella
equigenitalis_.

19-29 Dec 2008: 3 additional stallions on the index premises
identified as positive for _Taylorella equigenitalis_, CEM, by the
University of Kentucky's Livestock Disease Diagnostic Centre.
Laboratory samples from the 3 identified positive stallions have been
sent to NVSL [National Veterinary Services Laboratories] for
confirmation.

29-30 Dec 2008: 3 stallions epidemiologically linked to the index
premises have been confirmed culture positive by NVSL.

Numbers reported susceptible are preliminary and include all horses
which may have had contact with the CEM positive stallions or their
semen.

[This update report of new infections since the initial infection in
mid-December 2008 comes through epidemiologic and traceback work.
Kentucky and USDA-APHIS (Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service)
officials are to be appreciated for their comprehensive approach. As
indicated in the report, numbers are preliminary and should be
interpreted with caution unless one has assembled comprehensive
up-to-date information from all sources generating data, including
both field and laboratory sources. Previous reports had indicated
that there were 7 cases on the index farm, which contained 320
susceptible animals. The follow up report above indicates that there
the index stallion tested positive on 15 Dec 2008 and 3 other
stallions on the farm were determined to be positive between 19 and
29 Dec 2008. It is important to note that none of the affected horses
are thoroughbreds.

Additionally, the follow up report shown above indicates 3 horses,
which were epidemiologically linked, have tested positive. These were
identified on 29 and 30 Dec 2008. A recent posting from the Indiana
State Board of Animal Health website, dated 31 Dec 2008, states that 3
Indiana horses had tested positive -- see <http://www.in.gov/boah/>.
The USDA-APHIS website indicates that this is indeed the case, and
that the total number of exposed animals in Kentucky is 28, 6
stallions and 22 mares.

The problem, of course, is complicated greatly because outside of
Kentucky, there have been another 78 horses, 9 stallions, and 69 mares
that have been determined to be exposed. Another 250 horses are
actively being traced. All total, 27 states are involved in fighting
this disease outbreak. See
<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/newsroom/hot_issues/cem/index.shtml>.

In summary, the means of transmission for this disease is simple and
controllable but the sheer numbers and time path of treatment
protocols mean that a great deal of careful clean up work will have
to be sustained. This has been accomplished before in the 1978
outbreak although it did cost them the breeding season. We wish those
responsible good luck.

In a truly impressive commitment to transparency, the Central
Kentucky breeding farm involved is providing current up to date
information about the disease status of animals and a wealth of
general information on contagious equine metritis (CEM). Please see
<http://degraffstables.com/about-us/cem-outbreak-updates/>.

In 2008, other infected countries included Belgium, Czech Republic,
France, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

The horse industry in Kentucky alone provides a 100 000 jobs and has
an economic impact of about USD 5 billion, so this outbreak has
serious implications during already difficult economic conditions.
Let's hope that it can be contained as other previous outbreaks have
been. A factor working in favor of control is that the disease is a
venereal disease for which antibiotic treatment is possible. It can
also be transmitted by artificial insemination and fomites, such as
contaminated hands or instruments. Control of the disease is
complicated by the number of tracebacks involved and 27 states and
Canada will have to make sure their horses are clean.

A good summary of the likely economic and trade impacts of CEM can be
found at the USDA-APHIS-CEAH website at
