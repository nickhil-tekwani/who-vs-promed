ANTHRAX, HUMAN - USA 2001: LETTERS, NEW SUSPECT
***********************************************
Date: 2 Aug 2008
Subject: Bruce Ivins and the 2001 Anthrax letters
From: ProMEDmail.org


The accounts of FBI investigations of the late
Bruce Ivins are not always clear or relevant. But
in the meanwhile I would suggest that members
remain skeptical until hard criminal evidence is
presented.

Reports are lengthy and not easily precised. A selection follows:

CNN has some good information:

Bruce Ivins was the first to detect contamination
of USAMRIID research areas with anthrax from the
anthrax letters in 2002 but initially covered up
his findings:

Report: Anthrax suspect kills self before filing of criminal charges
---------------------------------------
A top U.S. biodefense researcher apparently
committed suicide just as the Justice Department
was about to file criminal charges against him in
the anthrax mailings that traumatized the nation
in the weeks following the September 11, 2001,
terrorist attacks, according to a published
report.

The scientist, Bruce E. Ivins, 62, who worked for
the past 18 years at the government's biodefense
labs at Fort Detrick, Maryland, had been told
about the impending prosecution, the Los Angeles
Times reported for Friday editions. The
laboratory has been at the center of the FBI's
investigation of the anthrax attacks, which
killed five people.

Ivins died Tuesday at Frederick (Maryland)
Memorial Hospital. The Times, quoting an
unidentified colleague, said the scientist had
taken a massive dose of a prescription Tylenol
mixed with codeine.

Tom Ivins, a brother of the scientist, told The
Associated Press that another of his brothers,
Charles, told him Bruce had committed suicide.

A woman who answered the phone at Charles Ivins'
home in Etowah, North Carolina, refused to wake
him and declined to comment on his death. "This
is a grieving time," she said.

A woman who answered the phone at Bruce Ivins'
home in Frederick declined to comment.

Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr and FBI
Assistant Director John Miller declined to
comment on the report.

Henry S. Heine, a scientist who had worked with
Ivins on inhalation anthrax research at Fort
Detrick, said he and others on their team have
testified before a federal grand jury in
Washington that has been investigating the
anthrax mailings for more than a year. VideoWatch

Heine declined to comment on Ivins' death.

Norman Covert, a retired Fort Detrick spokesman
who served with Ivins on an animal-care and
protocol committee, said Ivins was "a very intent
guy" at their meetings.

Ivins was the co-author of numerous anthrax
studies, including one on a treatment for
inhalation anthrax published in the July 7 issue
of the journal Antimicrobial Agents and
Chemotherapy.

Just last month, the government exonerated
another scientist at the Fort Detrick lab, Steven
Hatfill, who had been identified by the FBI as a
"person of interest" in the anthrax attacks. The
government paid Hatfill $5.82 million to settle a
lawsuit he filed against the Justice Department
in which he claimed the department violated his
privacy rights by speaking with reporters about
the case. VideoWatch U.S. government reach

The Times said federal investigators moved away
from Hatfill and concluded Ivins was the culprit
after FBI Director Robert Mueller changed
leadership of the investigation in 2006. The new
investigators instructed agents to re-examine
leads and reconsider potential suspects. In the
meantime, investigators made progress in
analyzing anthrax powder recovered from letters
addressed to two U.S. senators, according to the
report.

Besides the five deaths, 17 people were sickened
by anthrax that was mailed to lawmakers on
Capitol Hill and members of the news media in New
York and Florida just weeks after the September
11 terrorist attacks. The victims included postal
workers and others who came into contact with the
anthrax.

In the six months following the anthrax mailings,
Ivins conducted unauthorized testing for anthrax
spores outside containment areas at USAMRIID --
the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of
Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick -- and found
some, according to an internal report by the U.S.
Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, which
oversees the lab.

In December 2001, after conducting tests
triggered by a technician's fears that she had
been exposed, Ivins found evidence of anthrax and
decontaminated the woman's desk, computer, keypad
and monitor, but didn't notify his superiors,
according to the report.

The report says Ivins performed more unauthorized
sampling on April 15, 2002, and found anthrax
spores in his office, in a passbox used for
moving materials in and out of labs, and in a
room where male workers changed from civilian
clothing into laboratory garb.

Ivins told Army investigators he conducted
unauthorized tests because he was worried that
the powdered anthrax in letters that had been
sent to USAMRIID for analysis might not have been
adequately contained.

In January 2002, the FBI doubled the reward for
helping solve the case to $2.5 million, and by
June officials said the agency was scrutinizing
20 to 30 scientists who might have had the
knowledge and opportunity to send the anthrax
letters.

After the government's settlement with Hatfill
was announced in late June, Ivins started showing
signs of strain, the Times said. It quoted a
longtime colleague as saying Ivins was being
treated for depression and indicated to a
therapist that he was considering suicide. Family
members and local police escorted Ivins away from
the Army lab, and his access to sensitive areas
was curtailed, the colleague told the newspaper.
He said Ivins was facing a forced retirement in
September.

The colleague declined to be identified out of
concern that he would be harassed by the FBI, the
report said.

Ivins was one of the nation's leading biodefense researchers.

In 2003, Ivins and two of his colleagues at the
USAMRIID received the highest honor given to
Defense Department civilian employees for helping
solve technical problems in the manufacture of
anthrax vaccine.

In 1997, U.S. military personnel began receiving
the vaccine to protect against a possible
biological attack. Within months, a number of
vaccine lots failed a potency test required by
federal regulators, causing a shortage of vaccine
and eventually halting the immunization program.
The USAMRIID team's work led to the reapproval of
the vaccine for human use.

The Times said Ivins was the son of a
Princeton-educated pharmacist who was born and
raised in Lebanon, Ohio. He received
undergraduate and graduate degrees, including a
Ph.D. in microbiology, from the University of
Cincinnati.

He and his wife, Diane, owned a home just outside
the main gate to Fort Detrick.

[Bruce was patently a very sick and depressed man
when he committed suicide and who had been under
increasing pressure and surveillance. Time may
tell whether he was responsible for the
anthrax-filled letters in 2001. In the meanwhile
we would be wise to keep an open mind on this
highly respected anthrax scientist in this storm
of speculation. - Mod.MHJ]
