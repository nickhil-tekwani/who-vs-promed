This is a follow-up to a previous report.
According to the Iowa State Department of Public Health, there are
still 20 or so visitors to the wild Midwest Petting Zoo near Clermont,
Iowa whom they have been unable to contact. They have been
able to contact most of the visitors to the zoo from July 30 to
August 27 [1999 to advise them of possible exposure. So far,
there are between 100 and 150 visitors undergoing the post-
exposure prophylaxis, at a cost of about $1500 per person.
Prophylaxis is being recommended to those with exposure to the
bear's saliva. The Iowa Department of Public Health is awaiting
testing by the CDC to determine the strain of rabies.
Iowa is one of the leading states for reporting rabies in skunks as
well as in cats. My personal experience is that members of the
public have quite a bit of general knowledge about rabies, but
underestimate the risk of rabies exposure from animals such as
stray cats and farm cats, most of whom are not immunized. Clearly
the owner of the Petting Zoo was not knowledgeable about rabies
risks in rural Iowa. He was quoted as saying a person's risk for
contracting rabies from his bear was no higher than from petting a
goat at a large zoo. Since most large zoos are in urban areas, I
strongly disagree.
[Plus, zoo visitors don't wrestle with the animals, as was reported to
have occurred in this case - Mod.JW
Complacency about rabies risk is partially because Iowa has not
had a human case of rabies since 1951, and most people are not
aware of the number of animals confined or killed and tested, nor of
the number of people receiving post-exposure prophyllaxis [and the
cost of all this testing & vaccination - Mod.JW.
