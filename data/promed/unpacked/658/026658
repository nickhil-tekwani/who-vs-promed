The future looks bleak for Australian growers of ladyfinger bananas. While
demand for the smaller and some say sweeter fruit remains strong, Panama
disease continues to be a major problem.
Bob Campbell, from New South Wales Bananas, says delegates at the recent
national conference in Cairns were told there is no cure on the horizon.
"We've been looking for cures, chemical or biological, whatever it might be,
to try and help us in the industry down there, because our ladyfinger
production is dropping severely, because plantations are being wiped out
because of this fusarium," he said.
"So certainly ... [i]t's something that we're going to have to turn around and
try and develop our local market with the 2 varieties we have that are
resistant to it."

[Banana and plantain are the most important agricultural products in the
tropics, with annual production of over 100 [million] metric tons. Ladyfinger
bananas are a special type of banana. Of the various pathogens encountered in
the tropics, Panama disease [PD] (aka fusarium wilt), is the most
significant. PD is caused by the fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp _cubense_
[FOC]. PD was considered a major threat to banana production in the 1940s-
1950s, but planting of a PD-resistant banana known as the Gros Michel was a
breakthrough. Over time, Gros Michel was replaced by the 'Cavendish-type'
cultivar, which has remained in production to date.
Recently a new variant of FOC, tropical race 4 (TR4), has been responsible for
the Southeast Asian outbreaks. Unlike subtropical outbreaks that affect cold-
stressed Cavendish in Australia, the Canary Islands, and South Africa, TR4
affects Cavendish in the absence of predisposing factors. Although it is found
only in Southeast Asia, TR4 continues to spread in that region. The great fear
is that FOC will spread to the Americas and Africa, where it could have a
great impact on production of export bananas and plantains that normally
resist PD.
TR4 poses a serious threat to a multibillion-dollar industry and the food
stability of millions of poor farmers. In another development, phylogenetic
work on FOC has revealed that it has had at least 3 independent evolutionary
origins. Different clades of the pathogen are distantly related, and one is
more closely related to members of another forma specialis, _F. oxysporum_ f.
sp. _melonis_, than to other FOC clades.
There are 4 races of the PD pathogen: Race 1 attacks Ladyfinger, Sugar and
Ducasse bananas but not Cavendish; Race 2 attacks Bluggoe and Blue Java, but
not other banana varieties; Race 3 attacks only _Heliconia_ and is not a
problem on bananas; and Race 4 attacks nearly all varieties of bananas,
including the main commercial Cavendish variety. Effects range from reduced
yields to death of the plants. The soil remains infested indefinitely so that
only resistant varieties can be grown on that site in the future. These
effects create costs for production.
Disease management involves prompt detection and destruction of infected
plants, which cannot be cured. Strict quarantine regulations have to be
employed to prevent spread of infected material to clean areas through
movement of soil, water or plant materials. Foremost among preventive measures
is exclusion, supported by a general awareness of the characteristic external
and internal symptoms of Panama disease, so that reporting can take place.
