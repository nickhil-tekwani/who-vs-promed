PELICAN MORTALITY, UNDIAGNOSED - USA (FLORIDA): REQUEST FOR INFO

I am looking for some advice on identifying causes of impacts to brown
pelicans, gannets, cormorants, and other piscivorous birds along the
Atlantic coast of north Florida. Since late January we have bird
rehabilitators and others reporting impacts to numerous pelicans (>1,000)
from some as yet unknown agent(s). The impacts include but are not limited
to, loss of motor skills, frayed feathers, mortality (over 300 pelicans).
Birds are from emaciated to having high fat reserves, and from empty
stomachs to full of fish.
There is weak circumstantial evidence aqueous fire fighting foam (AFFF) may
be involved. However, tests on impacted birds show no correlation to AFFF.
Impacted birds have been subjected to necropsies from various veterinary
and wildlife laboratories, tested for metals (one industry official had
reported high arsenic levels in a single bird), AFFF, and are currently
being tested for bio-toxins. We have been working with the state of Florida
to identify any spills, or releases dating back to October.
So far all the data are coming back with values too low to account for
impacts.
Any Suggestions?
