A mosquito sample collected in Stanislaus County has tested positive for St. Louis encephalitis virus [SLEV], according to the area's 2 mosquito abatement districts.

Like West Nile Virus, most people who become infected with SLEV will never feel sick. Most people who do feel sick will have mild flu-like symptoms; a small number of people will have severe disease with headache, confusion, disorientation and dizziness. Seizures, paralysis, coma and sometimes death may occur. Severe disease is more likely in people who are older and those with weakened immune systems.

SLEV is related to the West Nile virus and is transmitted via the bite of _Culex_ mosquitoes, the same mosquitoes that transmit WNV.

"The discovery of positive mosquito pools is a reminder that we need to continuously prevent mosquito breeding in our community. There is no specific treatment for SLEV or WNV, so it is very important that people protect themselves and their families from mosquito bites," advises Dr. Julie Vaishampayan, Stanislaus County Public Health Officer. "We ask everyone to use mosquito repellents to protect themselves and their loved ones from mosquito-borne viruses, especially when they are outdoors."

Statewide, there have been 26 mosquito samples that have tested positive for SLEV this year [2021]. They are from 6 counties including Fresno, Imperial, Madera, Riverside, Stanislaus and Tulare. There have been no reports of SLEV in people this year. In 2020, there were 4 reports of people with SLEV in California; one of these was from Stanislaus County.

WNV detection in mosquitoes is increasing; a total of 133 mosquito samples have tested positive this year in Stanislaus County. WNV has also been confirmed in 2 dead birds.

The districts anticipate more SLEV and WNV detections in the coming months and would like to remind residents they can help by taking the following precautions:
- Dump or drain standing water. These are places mosquitoes like to lay their eggs.
- Defend yourself against mosquitoes by using repellants containing DEET, picaridin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus.
- Avoid being outdoors at dusk and dawn. These are the times when WNV [and SLEV] carrying mosquitoes are generally most active.
- Report neglected swimming pools to your local mosquito abatement district.
- Use tight-fitting door and window screens to keep mosquitoes from entering your home.

[Although there have been no reported human SLE cases this year (2021), there were 5 last year (2020) in the state (see St. Louis encephalitis virus - USA: (CA) human, mosquito, 2020 20210105.8071912). Cases of St. Louis encephalitis occur sporadically in California. The USA CDC reports that most people infected with SLE virus have no apparent illness (https://www.cdc.gov/sle/). The 1% who become ill develop fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and tiredness. Severe neuroinvasive disease (often involving encephalitis) occurs more commonly in older adults. Rarely, long-term disability or death can result. Unfortunately, there are no vaccines or medications available for human use. Avoidance of mosquito bites is the only preventive measure available. - Mod.TY
