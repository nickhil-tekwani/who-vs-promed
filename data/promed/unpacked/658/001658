[1] Indonesia: death of teenager

Indonesia: Death of teenager is 58th death
-----------------------------------------------
Indonesia has the highest human death toll from bird flu of any
nation, and on Wed 10 Jan 2007 that number grew to 58 when a boy,
from Tangerang near Jakarta, died, said the head of the Indonesian
health ministry's bird flu center, Runizar Ruesin. The boy was
admitted to hospital in the capital last week, and deaths among
poultry in his neighborhood had recently been reported, the WHO said
in a statement posted on its website <http://www.who.int/>.
Muhammad Nadirin, another official at the country's bird flu center,
said hospital staff had to take extra care washing the boy's corpse
because of concerns the virus might infect them. "He was washed using
special protection methods to prevent contagion," but added he didn't
know whether it could be transmitted from human-to-human this way.
The H5N1 virus mostly affects birds, but it has infected 263 people
in 10 countries since 2003, killing 157 of them. Scientists fear the
virus could mutate and spread rapidly between people, triggering a
pandemic that could sweep the globe in weeks and possibly kill millions.
An adviser to the White House said on Monday [8 Jan 2007] the number
of people that could die in a flu pandemic that matches the 1918-19
outbreak will be "very scary" and far higher than the 62 million
deaths forecast by a recent study by Harvard University. The 1918-19
"Spanish influenza" pandemic killed anywhere from 20 million to 100
million people.
In Viet Nam, bird flu has been confirmed in a 4th Vietnamese province
after tests on 70 ducks showed they had died from the H5N1 virus, a
government report said on Wednesday [10 Jan 2007]. The results of
tests on ducks found dead at the weekend prompted health workers to
slaughter around 1800 more ducks in 2 communes of Kien Giang province
in the southern Mekong Delta, the Animal Health Department report
said. The virus that 1st struck the delta region in late 2003
reemerged last month [December 2006]. Viet Nam has had no human H5N1
cases since November 2005.

China: Avian influenza situation - WHO update
-----------------------------------------------
As of 10 Jan 2007, the Ministry of Health in China has confirmed a
case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The case
is a 37-year-old man from Tunxi in Anhui Province. He became
symptomatic on 10 Dec 2006 and was hospitalized on 17 Dec 2006. The
patient was discharged on 6 Jan 2007 and is recovering well.
Information provided to WHO indicates that he was a farmer and may
have kept a number of birds in his backyard. No information on
possible exposure to diseased birds as the source of his infection is
presently available, but an investigation is under way. Close
contacts were placed under medical observation, but are all well and
were released on 29 Dec 2006. Of the 22 cases confirmed to date in
China, 14 have been fatal.
