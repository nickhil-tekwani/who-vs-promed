_Plasmopara australis_ newly recorded from Brazil on the new host _Luffa
cylindrica_
-------------------------------------------------
DJ Soares, DF Parreira, RW Barreto <rbarreto@ufv.br>, Departamento de
Fitopatologia, Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Vicosa, Minas Gerais,
Brazil, 36571-000. Accepted for publication 08/08/05.
_Luffa cylindrica_, known as smooth loofah, sponge gourd, dish-cloth gourd,
and vegetable sponge (local name: bucha) is a member of the _Cucurbitaceae_
that is native to tropical Asia, possibly India. It was an important crop
before the Second World War because of its use as a biological filter. In
Brazil, loofah is a subsistence crop for small farmers. A downy mildew,
caused by _Pseudoperonospora cubensis_, is one of the most important
diseases for this crop, but although this fungus is a common cucurbit
pathogen worldwide and also in Brazil, it has never been recorded on loofah
in Brazil.
In May of 2005 plants of _L. cylindrica_ were found showing moderate downy
mildew symptoms in a small spontaneous population in the locality of
Vicosa, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The lesions were amphigenous,
initiating as slight discolorations of the tissues, become yellowish to
necrotic, mostly vein-limited, with a clear water-soaked margin and a
white, lanose to felt-like mass of fungal structures abaxially. A sample
was deposited in the local herbarium (VIC 28797).
The fungus had the following morphology, as observed by light microscopy:
sporangiophores up to 460 micrometers long, aseptate, hyaline, cylindrical,
straight, with a slightly swollen base 10-18 micrometers, branches mostly
at right angles and with truncated tips, sporangia deciduous, predominately
oblong, 13-22 x 9-13 micrometers, l/w ratio (1.18-)1.36-1.90 (-2.20),
slightly papilate, sometimes with a small pedicel 1-2 micrometers long;
sexual stage not found. Morphology of this fungus places it unequivocally
in the genus _Plasmopara_. Only 2 _Plasmopara_ species are known on
_Cucurbitaceae_: _Plasmopara australis_ and _P. orientalis_.
Neither of these were ever reported on _L. cylindrica_. P. australis is
considered restricted to Argentina and North America, while P. orientalis
was recorded from far eastern Russia, China, and Japan. The combination of
characters presented by the fungus on loofah matches well within the
concept adopted by the former author for _P. australis_.
This is, therefore, the 1st record of this fungus for Brazil and the 1st
record of this fungus on _L. cylindrica_ worldwide.

[This report records the presence of _P. australis_ in Brazil for the 1st
time. Based on the information at hand, it is difficult to assess the
effect of the pathogen on the host. There is not much information about
downy mildew disease on this particular crop.
