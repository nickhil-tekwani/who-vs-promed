re: ProMED-mail Salmonellosis, st Typhimurium - Norway 20170925.5339353
----------------------------------------------------------------------
We have seen the same statement ["Outbreaks of salmonellosis in the Scandinavian countries are less common than in the USA, in part due to dietary differences"] from the moderator in postings in conjunction with salmonellosis in Scandinavia from December 2013 and November 2012, and together with my Scandinavian colleagues I have repeatedly brought to ProMED's attention how inappropriate this statement is (see our email from 2013).

[The 2013 comments are displayed below:]
"We, as representatives of the responsible authorities in Sweden, Norway, and Finland, would like to emphasise that the statement "Outbreaks of salmonellosis in the Scandinavian countries are less common than in the USA, in part due to dietary differences" is a strong simplification, and probably even wrong, as there are many complex parameters behind how the statistics on _Salmonella_ outbreaks in Scandinavia compare to the USA.

"In addition, it should be noted that there is a major difference in the way _Salmonella_ has been controlled in Scandinavia vs other parts of the world, including the US. For example, in Sweden, _Salmonella_ has been controlled in all parts of the production chain, including feed, since the 1950's. The _Salmonella_ control programmes in Sweden, Norway, and Finland have been very successful in reducing infection in both humans and animals which has been shown in official statistics (1,2) as well as publications estimating unbiased estimates of the salmonellosis incidence in both animals and humans several countries (3-13). The fact that food producing animals are a major source (including indirect contamination of for example vegetables via environmental contamination) has been shown in source attribution studies (14,15) and also by the reduction in number of human cases seen as a result of the successful pre-harvest control of _Salmonella_ in poultry recently implemented in the other EU-countries (16,17).

"In conclusion, we would argue that pre-harvest control of _Salmonella_ in food producing animals as well as control of imported food is the major reason for the low prevalence (in primary production) and incidence (in humans) in Sweden, Norway, and Finland, not dietary differences.

"Surprisingly, we sent this same text in response to a ProMED posting on 27 November 2012, at that time about an outbreak of salmonellosis, serotype Mikawashima, also in Norway. We did not receive a response from ProMED at that time. Since the same misperception appears again, one year later, we take the liberty to reiterate our statement.

ProMED-mail apologizes for having apparently missed the earlier submissions in response to a November 2012 post on _Salmonella_ in Norway, and another post in December 2013, and sincerely regret the frustrations caused by this. - Mods.LM/MPP/ML/LL
