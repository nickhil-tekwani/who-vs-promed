2000 turkeys diagnosed with bird flu near Jenin
-----------------------------------------------
A flock of 2000 turkeys has been diagnosed with the H5N1 "bird flu"
virus in the northern West Bank village of Silat Al-Harithiya near
Jenin, government officials said.

The veterinary department of the Palestinian Authority Agriculture
Ministry said it had managed to prevent an epidemic.

Director of the department in Jenin Jamil Makhamra told Ma'an that
government and private vets examined the flock on 27 Feb 2011 after
many of the birds died.

Samples were examined at the veterinary medicine center in Ramallah,
where it was confirmed that the birds had influenza A subtype of H5N1,
also known as "bird flu."

Makhamra said further samples were sent to a veterinary lab in Israel
on 2 Mar 2011, but that even before the results were received, vets
buried the dead birds, and killed and buried the rest of the flock
according to international regulations. The whole farm was sterilized,
Makhamra added.

Results from the Israeli lab confirmed that the turkeys had bird
flu.

The ministry official said all necessary procedures were carried out
according to international standards. All farms within 3 kilometers
were examined once every 48 hours, and a quarantine was imposed on a
10-kilometer [6.2-mile] radius for 3 days preventing the exit or entry
of any farm birds, he said.
