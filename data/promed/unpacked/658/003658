Ho Chi Minh City's market control bureau said illegal poultry trade
and transport had increased considerably, with 106 cases, more than
3-fold from last week [December 2006].
In the northern province of Lang Son, poultry trafficking from China
was exploding, with hundreds of tons of fowl illegally transported
into Viet Nam daily, which local authorities could not fully control.
Officials said poultry smuggling flared up because domestic fowl
prices were rising while smuggled fowl from China was much cheaper.
They added that smugglers could benefit substantially from their
business, especially in the months ahead of the Lunar New Year
holiday, when fowl demand peaks.
Tran Thi Trung Chien, Health Minister, launched Friday [29 Dec 2006]
a nationwide campaign for January [2007], urging people to sanitize
the environment, especially in poultry breeding farms, to control the
outbreak. Under the campaign, localities were guided to keep
surveillance on poultry trade and transport, especially at border check points.

[While poultry trafficking remains a patent and significant risk in
Asia thanks to ineffective controls, those of us outside Asia should
not relax our awareness of this risk. In the past, we have witnessed
the smuggling of parrots and such infected with Newcastle disease --
and if they can have that, they can have flu -- and for a country
with a weak commercial breeding program, the temptation to import
cheap replacement stock from a source which just happens to also have
HPAI can be great. If such an importing country is a neighbor, many
of us are at immediate risk. - Mod.MHJ]
