[1] Omissions in 2008 importation data
Date: Tue 14 Aug 2009
From: Kathleen Harriman <Kathleen.Harriman@cdph.ca.gov>


I would like to make some corrections to the 2008 measles importation
data reported in the ProMED-mail post archived as "Measles -
chronology of importations 20090414.1419." (Data for other years is
also incomplete).

California reported 12 cases of measles in 2008 that were related to
a traveler infected in Switzerland. However, the cases in Arizona
were not related to the California cases and were the result of a
separate importation from Switzerland. There were no additional cases
related to the infected infant who traveled from California to Hawaii.

In 2008, there were 3 other imported measles cases reported in
California; one infected in India, one in Italy, and one in Viet Nam.

In 2009, there have been 3 measles cases reported in California to
date, a case infected in England and 2 contacts of this case.

[2] Taiwan ex Viet Nam, 2009

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) announced today [Fri 10 Mar
2009] a 3rd incident of cluster measles infection caused by imported
measles. The target case was a one-year-and-one-month-old baby girl
who has not received MMR vaccination. The baby girl returned with her
mother from Viet Nam on 7 Feb 2009, and 5 days later, successive
suspected symptoms of measles such as fever and measles [rash?]
appeared. Before falling ill, the baby girl infected a baby boy in a
kindergarten (a 2-year-and-3-month-old baby boy, unvaccinated), [and]
also infected other patients under treatment in the same hospital (an
8-month-old baby boy and an 11-month-old baby girl, both
unvaccinated) as well as a visiting relative (a 31-year-old male,
vaccination history not known). These patients have all recovered,
while 558 people who have been in contact are now being monitored by
the public health units.

The CDC once more reminds the public that if there are babies who are
over one year old and have not received MMR vaccination, they should
complete vaccination as soon as possible. Before completion of
vaccination, they should refrain from going to regions rife with
measles for the time being in order to minimize infection.

International measles epidemics have become rather serious in 2009,
and measles epidemics have broken out in neighboring China and Viet
Nam, and successive epidemics have also been reported even in
advanced nations such as the UK, Switzerland and Australia. The CDC
points out that under frequent international exchange, introduction
of cases from offshore is difficult to avoid. It is necessary to
strengthen tracking of individual cases who have been in contact,
prevention of dissemination within the hospital, and actively carry
out vaccination of those unvaccinated. In addition, it is also
necessary to publicize among passengers from Southeast Asia and
mainland China and step up quarantine measures to stem further
dissemination of imported cases from offshore, and the public should
cooperate with the hospitals and medical institutions.

Measles is highly infectious but can be effectively prevented through
vaccination. CDC once more appeals for vaccination of those who have
reached the age of vaccination but have not yet been vaccinated.
Babies should be brought to the public health centers or contract
hospitals for assessment by doctors before receiving vaccination. And
infants who have not completed vaccination should not be taken to
prevalent high risk areas for the time being, such as China and
Southeast Asian nations, to safeguard health safety.

CDC also urges the various hospitals and medical institutions to
raise the alert and intensify reporting. Regarding citizens who have
returned to Taiwan for medical treatment, they should voluntarily
tell the doctor about their travel history to facilitate diagnosis
and timely prevention and treatment of the disease.

there are still omissions. Until childhood measles vaccination
becomes universal, all countries will remain at risk. - Mod.CP]
