Local media reported Wednesday [15 Jun 2011] that cases of FMD were
detected in Xai Xai, the capital of Gaza province in southern
Mozambique, saying the disease had hit the city and its suburbs.

According to health authorities, the disease was detected over the
weekend, and all movements of cattle have been suspended. FMD has
previously affected the Macia and Chicualacuala districts of Gaza.

However, the authorities had declared [the disease] under control by
late May [2011]. The authorities told the media that a livestock
vaccination campaign was launched in the affected areas on Tuesday [14
Jun 2011].

"The situation is no longer worrisome" said Jose Muamba at the
directorate of health in Xai Xai, quoted by the report.

Mr Muamba also called on people to bring their cattle to vaccination
centers. He also warned that those who violate this injunction would
be severely punished.

[OIE's interactive map showing all outbreaks since the start of the
epizootic in September 2010, restricted to Gaza and Maputo, is
available at

The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Mozambique can be seen

According to WAHID's data, FMD is currently circulating in several
countries in southern Africa. The following links provide updated
summaries including maps and the respective serotype for each of those
countries:

Botswana (serotype SAT2)

Mozambique (serotype SAT2)
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9766
South Africa (serotype SAT1)
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=10290
Zambia (serotype O)
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9970
Zimbabwe (serotype SAT2)
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9365.

The apparent circulation of 3 different serotypes deserves
confirmation from a reference FMD laboratory. - Mod.AS]
