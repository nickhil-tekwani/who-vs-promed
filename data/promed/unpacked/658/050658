After receiving numerous inquiries from concerned residents of Connecticut
who live near the border with Rhode Island, the Connecticut Department of
Public Health sent the following memo to local health directors on February
26, 1998:
Subject: Meningococcal Vaccination Policy
On February 23, 1998, the Rhode Island Department of Health found it
necessary to announce a new policy for the use of meningococcal vaccine and
recommended that all children and young adults ages 2 years to 22 years
receive meningococcal vaccine from their primary care providers over the
next 6 months, unless they have been previously immunized during the last
3 years.
This policy differs from the policy recommended by the Advisory Committee
on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC). The ACIP policy is endorsed by the Connecticut
Department of Public Health (DPH).
The ACIP recommends that "routine vaccination of civilians with the
quadrivalent meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine is not recommended
because of its relative ineffectiveness in children <2 years of age (among
whom risk for endemic disease is highest) and its relatively short duration
of protection" [MMWR 1997;46(No. RR-5).
The ACIP recommends the large-scale use of the polysaccharide meningococcal
vaccine only for controlling outbreaks of meningococcal disease. In recent
years, most of the meningococcal disease outbreaks in the United States
have been due to a specific strain of the bacteria called serogroup C. A
community-based outbreak of serogroup C meningococcal disease (SCMD) is
defined as the occurrence of three or more confirmed or probable cases
during a period of 3 months or less among persons residing in the same area
who are not close contacts of each other and who do not share a common
affiliation, with a primary attack rate of at least 10 cases per 100,000
population. Community-based outbreaks have occurred in towns, cities, and
counties.
The only time these outbreak criteria have been met in Connecticut was in
May 1993. At that time, three cases of SCMD occurred over 5 days on the
University of Connecticut campus in Storrs; subsequently, almost 12,000
students received meningococcal vaccine.
In Connecticut, the annual number of meningococcal disease cases has been
relatively stable over the past 10 years, with an average of 44 cases
reported each year and a rate of slightly more than 1 case per 100,000
population. So far in 1998, 12 cases of meningococcal disease have
occurred in Connecticut, which is about the expected number for this time
of year. Only one of these cases has occurred in a county bordering Rhode
Island.
The Connecticut DPH will continue to recommend meningococcal disease
control measures that are consistent with the national ACIP policy.
Antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis of close contacts of sporadic cases of
meningococcal disease is the primary means for prevention of meningococcal
disease in the United States.
We do not recommend the administration of meningococcal vaccine to
Connecticut children living close to the Rhode Island border or who visit
Rhode Island. An outbreak strain of meningococcal bacteria has not been
identified in Rhode Island. In addition, the threshold level of risk has
not been reached that would justify vaccinating any Connecticut children at
this time.
We hope that this information will help you answer inquiries from concerned
citizens, legislators, and members of the press.
