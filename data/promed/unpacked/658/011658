A red tide warning has been issued for the Cape West coast and False
Bay. Grant Pitcher, the marine and coastal management principal
specialist scientist, says a long stretch of the coast has been
affected. The alarm was raised following reports that at least 3
people fell ill with paralytic shellfish poisoning after eating
seafood from the coast at Lamberts Bay.
Marine and coastal management has warned the public not to eat any
shellfish collected from the coast. Marine scientists are
investigating, and samples tested have found that a toxic red tide is
widespread all along the coast to as far north as Lamberts Bay.
Pitcher says: "There is another problem that is on the West Coast, up
in the St Helena Bay region near Lamberts Bay, where there are blooms
that are visually less impressive, but they have some toxic organism
in them, and these are causing shellfish to become toxic, and now we
have some reports, 3 separate incidences, of people becoming ill
having consumed shellfish in that area."
Meanwhile, non-toxic red tide blooms persist along the False Bay
Coast. Scientists have warned that if the blooms start to decay, it
could cause a rapid decline in oxygen in the water. And that could
lead to high scale mortalities of flora and fauna.
The Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism has warned the
public not to eat any shellfish or lobster liver found on the West
Coast, following reports of 3 people becoming ill after eating
shellfish collected in Western Cape. The problem may be a result of a
toxic red tide, said the department in a statement on Friday [16 Mar
2007]. It is investigating, and samples are being tested, it said.
"Animals, such as lobsters, that feed on toxic shellfish can
accumulate the toxins in their digestive gland with no apparent
effect, but will accumulate toxins in their liver. Members of the
public are therefore advised not to eat lobster liver too."
The reported incidents appeared to display symptoms of paralytic
shellfish poisoning. Typical symptoms include tingling and numbness
of the mouth, lips and fingers, which usually occur within the 1st 30
minutes after the ingestion of toxic shellfish. Advanced symptoms
include dizziness, incoherent speech, uncoordinated limbs with slight
difficulty in breathing, and a rapid pulse. In severe cases it may
cause paralysis. Meanwhile, a non-toxic red tide persisted along
False Bay, the department said.

[Red tide is caused by several toxic algae. Depending upon the effect
the toxin has, it is also known as paralytic shellfish poisoning
(PSP), because it causes shellfish to be toxic for consumption.
PSP is a significant problem in several geographic areas, especially
on both the east and west coasts of the U.S. Produced by several
closely related species in the genus _Alexandrium_, PSP toxins are
responsible for persistent problems due to their accumulation in
filter-feeding shellfish, but they also move through the food chain,
affecting zooplankton, fish larvae, adult fish, and even birds and
marine mammals.
_Alexandrium_ blooms generally do not involve large-cell
accumulations that discolor the water and may instead be below the
water surface, where they are not visible. Low-density populations
can cause severe problems due to the high potency of the toxins
produced. Furthermore, _Alexandrium_ spp. can grow in relatively
pristine waters, and it is difficult to argue that anthropogenic
nutrient inputs are stimulating the blooms. These characteristics are
important when considering mitigation and control strategies.
Often PSP is associated with red tides or algal blooms. Red tide is
caused by an organism called _Karenia brevis_, which in high
concentration can make the water look red. The organism releases a
toxin that paralyzes the respiratory system of fish and other marine life.
Airborne toxins, water spray, and splashes in an outbreak have kept
people from beaches while leaving others with irritated eyes and
throats. Red tide irritates the skin of people exposed to it and can
cause itchy eyes, scratchy throats, and coughs.
Harvesting from affected areas for personal consumption is
discouraged. Red tide poisoning symptoms include nausea and dizziness
and may last for several days.
Previously, the organism causing red tide was known as _Gymnodinium
breve_, but it has been reclassified in the taxonomy of
dinoflagellates. Its new name is _Karenia brevis_, or _K. brevis_.
Karenia was chosen in honor of Dr. Karen Steidinger, a prominent red
tide scientist from the Florida Marine Research Institute in St.
Petersburg, Florida
