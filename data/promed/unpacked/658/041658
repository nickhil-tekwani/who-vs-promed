Mystery fever creates havoc in Chhara village
------------------------
As many as 173 cases of some mysterious fever have been detected in Chhara
village of Kodinar taluka in Junagadh district.
In last month alone, 8 children and around 25 to 30 adults died due to the
fever. A special control room has now been set up in the village to help
the affected people.
Health officials in Junagadh told TNN that 3 teams of doctors and senior
officials of the health department have rushed to the village to start
immediate treatment of the affected people. These doctors have taken blood
samples and sent them for analysis, officials said. Water samples have also
been taken.
"The deaths could be due to viral infection, blood deficiency, or even
superstition [? a rather unusual cause of death]. Only one case of malaria
has been detected so far," said a health official. The village has a
population of 6000 people.
District collector Rohit Pathak said, "The death toll is much lower than
what is claimed by villagers. Besides, people had taken treatment at a
private dispensary and had not informed government officials of the fever.
The death of children could have been made possible by lack of proper
treatment." The children who succumbed to the fever died within 3 days of
coming down with it.
Meanwhile, doctors confirmed having detected falciparum malarial fever in
some patients.
The village sarpanch [a head of local self-governmental body] told TNN that
if the medical teams had reached the village earlier, many innocent lives
could have been saved, and the disease could have been stopped from taking
epidemic proportions.

[The information given in the news article above is too sketchy to venture
a differential diagnosis of what may be causing this increase in morbidity
and mortality. The article mentions confirmation of one or more cases of
_Plasmodium falciparum_ . As Gujarat state is endemic for malaria, with the
district of Junagadh reporting an 84 percent increase in cases from 2000 to
2001
(<http://gujhealth.gov.in/health_final/malaria/districtwisemalaria.htm>),
it is possible that this outbreak is attributable to an increase in malaria.
More information on this outbreak would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
