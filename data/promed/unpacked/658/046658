Yellow Fever Continues to Claim Many Lives in Guinea
----------------------------------------------------
ABIDJAN: At least 88 people have died from yellow fever in an unusual
outbreak of the mosquito-borne disease in central Guinea. The epidemic is
centred in the area of Mamou, about 200 km east of the capital, Conakry, a
doctor with the World Health Organisation (WHO) in Conakry told the UN
Integrated Regional Information Network (IRIN) on Fri 24 Nov 2000. He said
medical workers had already vaccinated 100 000 people in Mamou and aimed to
inoculate nearly 200 000 more in the short term. The population is also
receiving information about the disease and on the use of mosquito nets.
The doctor said it was the first yellow fever outbreak of such severity in
the region and an investigation was underway. He attributed the outbreak
to large population movements and changing ecology. There have also been
yellow fever outbreaks in neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone this
year. All 3 countries are characterized by [political instability, high
numbers of internally-displaced persons or refugees, and environmental
degradation. The city of Mamou is located about 30 km north of the border
with Sierra Leone, where hundreds of thousands of refugees are camped.

Dr. J. ter Meulen (Marburg) has supplied the following supplementary
information to that contained in his report posted in Yellow fever Guinea
(Mamou) (04). He writes "Our short stretch of PCR fragment (approx. 350
nc) has exactly 93% similarity with different yellow fever virus sequences
from Genbank, including the French viscerotropic strain and a yellow fever
virus isolate from Senegal, made in 1965 (Dar 1279). This fragment is too
short for a meaningful phylogeny. To avoid any confusion, maybe we should
restate our conclusion: Namely, that preliminary sequence analysis of short
PCR fragments (envelope gene) amplified from patients from Mamou
revealed >90% identity at the nucleotide level with the different yellow
fever virus isolates from West Africa. Analysis of longer sequences for a
more detailed phylogeny is in progress." - Mod.CP
