Pakistan, India could suffer drastic fall in wheat output due to new rust
-----------------------------------------------
Wheat producing countries, including Pakistan and India, may suffer a
drastic decline in production due to a new kind of rust, which has
recently been found in an African country and which is heading
towards South Asia, an international agriculture expert told the
Daily Times on Saturday [13 May 2006].
Existing varieties of wheat are highly susceptible to the rust, found
in wheat crops in the East African countries of Tanzania and Uganda.
The rust, which is similar to that found in Uganda, has been found in
the coastal areas of Sindh. The new rust could deprive each wheat
producing country of over 50 or even 55 percent of production of food
grain in the years to come.
The expert was of the view that it would take at least 8 or 9 years
to develop a new infection-resisting variety of wheat. According to
initial assessments, the rust could greatly damage crops wherever it
goes. The rust is transmittable through air [by spores - Mod.JAD],
and it would largely depend on wind direction. If the air was
directed eastward from African countries, it would be a major
challenge for Pakistan and India, which are among the big producers
of wheat.
The new infection could damage wheat in the next season if it
penetrated northern parts of the country, especially Punjab.
Most Indian wheat is grown in Punjab. Last year [2005], the wheat
production of the country stood at around 21.6 million tons. If the
rust was found in other parts of the country, then the production
could be over 50 [percent] less than the average wheat production of
the country.
According to the expert, currently no variety of wheat is resistant
to the new infection. Rust is not new. It is an old phenomenon, but
the real problem is that the new infection is to be defeated [can
only be managed] by developing a new variety. Currently, all the
varieties are susceptible varieties and do not have the ability to
retard fungal growth.

[The cereal crop plant wheat (bread wheat, _Triticum aestivum_ and
durum wheat, _Triticum turgidum_) develops symptoms of stem rust when
infected with the fungus _Puccinia graminis f.sp. tritici_. Severe
losses due to wheat stem rust have been held at bay worldwide due to
effective resistance breeding.
A strain of stem rust, now called Ug99, was found in Uganda in 1999,
and it has since spread to Kenya and Ethiopia. It is thought to have
the potential to seriously damage wheat production there and
elsewhere. This is because it can overcome resistance in wheat
offered by the commonly deployed Sr31 gene.
Great concern has been expressed over the consequences of this strain
reaching Asia, and the current report seems to indicate that this may
have happened. This report is not sufficiently clear on the true
identity of the strain mentioned, but the information provided
suggests the newly detected stem rust infections in the coastal areas
of Sindh, Pakistan could be Ug99. If correct, this is a significant
finding and will have to be followed carefully since most articles on
this strain suggest it could cause a global food crisis.
It has not reached the main wheat production areas of Pakistan in the
Punjab, but it is worth noting that wheat accounts for 60 percent of
the calories and more than 40 percent of the protein in the average
daily diet of that country by some estimates.
About 70 percent of U.S. wheat varieties are thought to be
susceptible to Ug99. Between 70 and 75 percent of wheat grown in
India and Pakistan are also susceptible to this rust, and wheat in
Egypt and China is thought to have similar vulnerabilities.
In an earlier 2006 posting (20060406.1039), concerns were raised that
current (2006) ongoing initiatives to import wheat to India could
lead to the introduction of new pathogens such as Ug99. There is no
indication that importation has played any part in this outbreak of
stem rust in Pakistan. This report will help intensify ongoing
efforts to select or breed new wheat varieties resistant to Ug99.
Addressing the potential issues raised in this posting is the purpose
of the Global Rust Initiative (see link), which has as its mission
the systematic elimination of the world's vulnerability to the stem
rust race Ug99.
