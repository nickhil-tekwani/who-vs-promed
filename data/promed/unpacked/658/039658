Mangoes are flowering and unfortunately powdery mildew is blooming as
well. This disease is caused by a fungus, _Oidium mangiferae_, first
reported in Hawaii in 1983. There are many species of _Oidium_, but
this one only affects mangoes. It can result in severe yield
reduction if not controlled.

It commonly affects mango blossoms, giving the whole flower spike a
grayish cast, and killing the flowers. In addition to the blossoms,
the disease also affects the leaves and young fruit of mango.

Temperatures in much of the state at this time of year are favorable
to its development. Control measures will be needed for most mango
varieties.

[Powdery mildew of mango caused by the fungus _Oidium mangiferae_ is
one of the most serious diseases of the crop affecting almost all
varieties to varying degrees. The disease is reported to cause yield
losses of up to 80 percent on individual trees.

The pathogen parasitises young tissues and affected flowers and
fruits drop prematurely, or fruit set may be prevented. Disease
development is favoured by moderate temperatures and low rainfall.
Spores are dispersed by wind, water, or mechanical means. Between
seasons, the fungus survives on infected plant parts and in debris
such as fallen leaves. Disease management includes fungicides and
cultural practices.

Powdery mildews are a group of fungi causing a white 'powdery' growth
on their hosts and can lead to serious losses in many important
crops. Generally, each species of fungus is specific to a small
number of host species.
