Authorities battle to control foot and mouth in Limpopo
-------------------------------------------------------
The national department of agriculture is still battling to bring the
spread of foot and mouth disease [FMD] under control in the Giyani area of
Limpopo province.
Lucas Mampane, head of veterinary services in Limpopo, says 25 cases have
been reported at Taulome village in the Greater Letaba Municipality. The
disease was 1st reported at Seloane village in June this year [2004].
Mampane says the spread may have originated in stock that was not
vaccinated in the area. He says the campaign to curb the disease will last
longer than expected.

[South Africa's 1st FMD outbreak during 2004 is reported in the monthly
report to the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) for June 2004; it
was caused by FMD virus serotype SAT2. The 3 later reports available,
namely the monthly reports for July, August, and September 2004, do not
mention additional outbreaks. But a follow-up report (No. 4) was sent to
the OIE on 22 Oct 2004 and is available at
