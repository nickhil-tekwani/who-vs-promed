Mississippi reports 1st soybean rust in kudzu, soybeans
-------------------------------------------------------
Soybean rust has been found for the 1st time this year [2006] in
Mississippi, in soybeans and on kudzu in Jefferson County on the Louisiana
border.
This becomes the 28th US county positive for rust in 2006 and expands the
affected states to 6: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi,
and Texas.
The Mississippi state commentary posted tonight on the USDA PIPE website
said "rust was heavy on kudzu in an area about 30 feet in diameter.
However, rust was difficult to find in soybeans."
Scouting continues in production fields, sentinel plots and alternative
hosts, the commentary said. Mississippi sentinel plot growth stages range
from R3 to R7.
Mississippi is recommending that some growers consider a fungicide application.
Specifically, the commentary said tonight, "Producers in the SW portion of
the state that have soybeans that are in reproductive growth stage R5.5 or
a younger reproductive stage need to consider application of a fungicide,
particularly a triazole or a mix. Soybeans in our major growing areas in
North Mississippi and the Delta have nothing to be concerned about at this
time.
"It's been hot and extremely dry in those areas, unfavorable for rust
development. Scouting will continue, and these management suggestions will
be modified based on the scouting results and weather conditions."
The USDA national commentary recaps that: "Currently, rust has been found
on this year's [2006] soybeans in 8 different counties in 5 states (AL, FL,
GA, LA, MS); the rest of the finds have been on kudzu. A total of 28
counties have reported rust this year: 5 in Alabama, 13 in Florida, 5 in
Georgia, 3 in Louisiana, one in Mississippi and one in Texas."
Mississippi was one of the 1st states to identify an Asian soybean rust
infection when the fungus 1st arrived in the continental United States in
Nov 2004. Rust was found on soybeans in Adams County -- the next county
south of Jefferson County -- on 16 Nov 2004.
In 2005, the 1st soybean rust in Mississippi was located on a single leaf
pulled on 13 Jul 2005 from a soybean sentinel plot in George County in
south east Mississippi. The state's only other infected county last year
[2005] was Pearl River County (about 2 counties south of Jefferson County)
about this time last year on 5 Aug 2005.

Florida reports more soybean rust
---------------------------------
Another outbreak of Asian soybean rust was confirmed in a soybean sentinel
plot in north Florida, USDA reported on its soybean rust website.
The outbreak represents the 13th Florida county and the 27th US county to
report an outbreak in 2006.
A soybean sentinel plot in Jefferson County in northern Florida was
confirmed positive for soybean rust on stage 7 leaves collected 27 Jul
2006. Two stage 7 leaves were found to have 2 per cent disease severity;
another stage 5 leaf from the same plot was also visually identified to
have one pustule of rust, the report said.
This is a 1st for the county in 2006; it was also positive in 2005. A kudzu
sample in Alachua County, Florida, also collected 27 Jul 2006, was positive
for soybean rust. The site is about 12 miles north of an active infection
site on kudzu in Marion County.
Soybean sentinel plots in Gadsden County were positive from a 21 Jul 2006
sample. These are within 3 miles of a known positive kudzu site.
All positive plots are actively sporulating. It appears recent rains have
begun to spread the disease. No other sentinel plots in the panhandle are
known to be positive at this time, Florida researchers said in comments on
the USDA website.
"We have returned to a more normal rainfall pattern, with most days having
rain somewhere in the region, although often it is very local. Still, in
the panhandle, we are about 50 per cent below normal rainfall for the year."
Humidity is high and dew is present, so infections and sporulation are
ongoing in infected plots.
"As most counties are still negative, risk of rust to soybean growers in
Florida is still minimal at this time. However, growers should reevaluate
the situation frequently," the researchers said.

1st soybean rust found on soybeans in Louisiana
-----------------------------------------------
The 1st Asian soybean rust on soybeans in Louisiana this year [2006] was
confirmed in Rapides Parish today [26 Jul 2006], and growers are being told
to spray soybeans in R1 through R5 growth stages.
The infected soybeans are Group Vs and are at R7 growth stage, according to
the Louisiana state commentary. This is the farthest west in the United
States that soybean rust is active at the moment, and the northern-most
point in Louisiana with rust.
In that commentary and in an email to fellow soybean specialists, Louisiana
State University plant pathologist Clayton Hollier said growers should
consider spraying their soybeans as follows:
"The recommendation is for soybeans in the R1 through R5 growth stages that
have a good yield potential to be treated with a rust fungicide. The
fungicides for rust control have a triazole alone or in combination with a
strobilurin. These products are listed in the 2006 Plant Disease Management
Guide and are on the LSU AgCenter Rust website."
Currently, rust has been found on this year's [2006] soybeans in 6 counties
in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Louisiana. The rest of the finds have
been on kudzu.
Don Hershman, University of Kentucky plant pathologist, told his listserv
today that "considering that the incidence of soybean rust in the (LA) plot
was 75 per cent, this is a significant find. It suggests to me that we
could soon see an upturn in soybean rust findings in the lower Midsouth in
areas that have had disease-favorable weather recently."
Hershman said to note that "conditions have been very dry in much of
Mississippi and Arkansas and portions of Louisiana. Thus, not all sections
of the lower Midsouth have been favorable for soybean rust. The risk of
soybean rust in KY is still very low at this time."
A total of 26 counties have reported rust this year [2006] and include 5 in
Alabama, 12 in Florida, 5 in Georgia, 3 in Louisiana, and one in Texas.

Soybean rust found in 3 Gadsden County, FL sentinel plots
---------------------------------------------------------
Florida officials say soybean rust was found on 3 sentinel soybean plots in
Gadsden County in north central Florida. These sites were located within 3
miles of an infected kudzu site.
Currently, rust has only been found on this year's [2006] soybeans in 5
different counties in 3 states (Alabama, Florida and Georgia); the rest of
the finds have been on kudzu. A total of 25 counties have reported rust
this year and include 5 in Alabama, 12 in Florida, 5 in Georgia, 2 in
Louisiana, and one in Texas.
This is the full report of the new Florida finds from the state commentary:
In samples taken the week of 17 Jul 2006, the 3 sentinel plots in Gadsden
County were positive from a 21 Jul 2006 sample. These are all located
within 3 miles of a known positive kudzu site. All positive plots are
actively sporulating.
The county has had infected kudzu, and it appears that recent rains have
begun to spread the disease. Each of the plots was planted to MGIII, MGV,
and MGVII beans and is now at growth stages R6, R5, and R3, respectively.
In 2 of the plots, one sporulating rust pustule was observed in a 100-leaf
sample from the MGIII variety; in the 3rd plot 2 leaves from the MGVII
variety were heavily infected.
Most of the Florida panhandle has had one or more rain events since these
samples were taken, and it looks like rain again today. No other sentinel
plots in the panhandle are known to be positive at this time.
These are the 1st positive soybean sentinel plots in north Florida. With
the recent rains, the positive kudzu sites around the state are beginning
to develop disease rapidly with abundant sporulation; however no new
positive kudzu sites have been found recently.
North central Florida has returned to a more normal rainfall pattern, with
most days having rain somewhere in the region, although often it is very
local. Still, in the panhandle, areas are about 50 per cent below normal
rainfall for the year. Humidity is high and dew is present, so infections
and sporulation are ongoing in infected plots.
As most counties are still negative, risk of rust to soybean growers in
Florida is still minimal at this time. However growers should reevaluate
the situation frequently.
A Florida rust "hotline" has been established. A nation-wide toll free
number -- (866) 361-9942 -- can be used to access it.

Soybean rust found on soybean in Brooks County, GA
--------------------------------------------------
Georgia officials reported today [24 Jul 2006] a soybean rust find on
soybeans in Brooks County. The 2 previous finds in this county have been on
kudzu.
According to the state commentary, "The soybean sample was collected from a
soybean field grown for an industry product trial, and rust was confirmed
with a microscope. 10 or so leaves were examined, and all 10 leaves were
infected with sporulating soybean rust pustules.
"South Georgia has been getting some rainfall over the last couple of
weeks, and we are starting to detect more soybean rust, perhaps due to
recent rainfall. Soybean rust had already been confirmed in the same county
on kudzu at 2 different locations, so this find was not a surprise."
Currently, rust has only been found on this year's [2006] soybeans in 4
different counties in 3 states (AL, FL, GA); the rest of the finds have
been on kudzu. A total of 25 counties have reported rust this year and
include 5 in Alabama, 12 in Florida, 5 in Georgia, 2 in Louisiana, and one
in Texas.

[Asian soybean rust(ASR) is a plant disease caused by the fungus
_Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ and was introduced into the USA in 2004. In
addition to the crop plant soybean (_Glycine max_), cowpeas, green beans,
and other edible legumes could be affected by the ASR pathogen, which
causes defoliation and yield reduction. Kudzu (_Pueraria lobata_, also
known as Japanese arrowroot) is an important alternate host for the
pathogen in southern states of the USA.
In this update, 1st reports in 2006 are provided for ASR on soybean in
Louisiana and Mississippi and for specific counties in Georgia and Florida.
Most reports are for locations where ASR on kudzu has been reported
previously. Dry weather, which is non-conducive for the spread of ASR, is
also mentioned in several reports. Recommendations to spray crops as a
preventive measure have been issued based on some of these observations.
This update records new findings of ASR since the report of 10 Jul 2006 of
ASR in soybeans in Decatur County, Georgia. The USDA national commentary
recaps at the beginning of August 2006 that: "Currently, rust has been
found on this year's soybeans in 8 different counties in 5 states (AL, FL,
GA, LA, MS); the rest of the finds have been on kudzu. A total of 28
counties have reported rust this year: 5 in Alabama, 13 in Florida, 5 in
Georgia, 3 in Louisiana, one in Mississippi and one in Texas." The majority
of detections in soybean have been in sentinel plots, and a major outbreak
of ASR on commercial soybean crops has yet to be reported in 2006.
