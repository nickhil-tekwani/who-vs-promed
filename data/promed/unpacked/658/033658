The Ministry of Agriculture announced today [14 Jan 2022] that control has been gained over the outbreak of the bird flu that has hit hard the crane population in the Agamon Hahula area and led to the culling of poultry in farms of northern Israel. This week (16-21 Jan 2022) professionals are expected to concentrate their efforts on cleaning, disinfecting and monitoring the flu.

Most of the crane carcasses have already been disposed of. In the coming weeks, monitoring operations will be conducted at the site to make sure there are none left. If conditions allow, the site will be reopened to visitors within a few weeks.

The 1st case of the disease in the current outbreak was discovered in a pelican in the north of the country that was apparently infected from contact with migratory birds. The disease then spread to cranes and from there to chicken coops in other areas. About one million chickens had to be killed.

During an online meeting of experts held this week at the initiative of the Steinhardt Museum of Nature at Tel Aviv University [see further in the commentary], the director of the Veterinary Services, Dr. Tamir Goshen, indicated that there is a problem with the biosafety level of layer coops in Israel and that they are far from meeting the requirements accepted in developed countries.

One of the examples Goshen provided was the ease with which visitors can enter coops in the country, creating risk of infection. Another problem presented was the deficient monitoring activity in wild birds, including systematic collection of wild birds to be tested.

The Director of the Science Division at the Nature and Parks Authority, Dr. Yehoshua Shakedi said that the authority has a plan to deal with the issue, but it has not yet been funded.

The Ministry of Agriculture has announced that it will formulate a recovery plan and preparations for the next migratory season of wild birds.

The ministry noted that avian flu is introduced every year into Israel but its spread during the current season was exceptional and that the virus strain found this year [2022] -- H5N1 -- is regarded hazardous to humans.

An expert committee has been assigned by Israel's National Emergency Management Authority (NEMA) to formulate recommendations concerning the preparations for possible future bird flu outbreaks, to include also re-examination of the management of the Agamon Hahula site.

This site has become one of Israel's leading attractions as far as number of visitors is concerned. Every year, flocks counting tens of thousands birds arrive at this site. Nature conservation bodies will be required to examine the cranes' feeding policy as applied on the site in order to prevent them from flying to nearby agricultural fields, damaging crops. This policy has led to an increase in the number of migrating birds who remain in the country and do not migrate further to Africa.

[The mentioned online (zoom) webinar was held by the Tel Aviv University's Museum of Natural History on 11 Jan 2022. It was titled, "How can we prepare for the next wave?"

An introductory presentation, based on information from the National Veterinary Services (poultry health division) and, for wild birds, from the Nature and Parks Authority, included the following Outstanding Loss:
1. Poultry: More than 1.1 million birds culled in more than 20 poultry farms.
2. Wild birds:
a. Common cranes (_Grus grus_, over-wintering) - about 8000 dead birds at the Agamon Hula; all 28 tested birds were H5N1 positive.
b. Great white pelican (_Pelecanus onocrotalus_, over-wintering) - tens of dead birds observed, all 7 tested birds were H5N1 positive.
c. Eurasian kestrel (_Falco tinnunculus_, mostly resident) - some dead birds observed, all 4 tested birds were H5N1 positive.
d. Common buzzard (_Buteo buteo_, over-wintering) - some dead birds observed, 3 or 4 tested birds were H5N1 positive.
e. Marbled teal (_Marmaronetta angustirostris_, resident) - one dead bird collected, tested positive for H5N1.

Ran Nathan, of the Movement Ecology Lab, Hebrew University, presented the continuous follow-up of tagged cranes from Russia from 1 Dec 2021 to 10 Jan 2022. In 4 of the 10 tagged cranes, measurements indicative of affected health were recorded, eventually terminating in death.

The points in time, for each of the 4 adult animals (3-4 years old; 3 males and one female) were presented: a. Beginning of disease according to ODBA (Overall Dynamic Body Acceleration, reflecting energetic expenditure); b. Beginning of disease according to movements; c. bird death. In addition, the date of the beginning of diversionary feeding (obviously, similar for all 4 birds) was included.

ODBA seems to be the earliest predictor of disease; the earliest case started 13 December 2021. Notably, the 1st outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 on poultry farms were recorded in mid-November 2021 (in central and southern Israel), thus a month before the start of the crane epizootic in the north.

The webinar included also presentations of invited guest speakers: David Swayne, USDA, ARS, USA; Susan Shriner, USDA, National Wildlife Research Center, USA and Thijs Kuiken, Dep Virology, Erasmus Medical Centre, The Netherlands.

In case a recording of the webinar's presentations becomes available online, ProMED will publish the link.
