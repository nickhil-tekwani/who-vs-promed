It would be very interesting to verify the calicivirus -- viral
rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) -- hypothesis. In fact, we should
consider that, until now, only the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus
cuniculus_), wild or domestic, has been shown to be fully susceptible
to the RHD virus, and all attempts to reproduce the disease in other
lagomorph species (_Lepus_ spp. and _Sylvilagus_ spp.) have failed.
To our knowledge the known pathogenic caliciviruses of the
_Lagovirus_ genus (RHDV [Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus] and EBHSV
[European brown hare syndrome virus]) are strictly species-specific.
For this reason, we would be very pleased to examine the sample [from
_Brachylagus idahoensis_] and, in case of positive results for RHDV,
to perform a full antigenic and genomic characterization of the strain.

Between 6 Feb and 14 Mar 2007, 10 of 20 pygmy rabbits housed at
Northwest Trek Wildlife Park have died. There does not appear to be
an age or sex predilection. The only antemortem clinical sign noted
has been soft stools within 12 hours of death in about half of the
deceased rabbits.
The rabbits are part of a captive breeding program designed to
produce animals in order to re-establish this endangered species in
the wild in the state of Washington.
Acute erosive ileotyphlitis [inflammation of the ileum and caecum]
and colitis are the most significant pathologic findings in 4 of the
5 rabbits for which histology has been completed.
From the pathology reports: "The changes in the alimentary tract are
acute and likely to be the cause of death. These changes most closely
resemble bacterial infection, as might occur with colibacillosis or
clostridial enterotoxemia, but _Lawsonia_, coronavirus, or rotavirus
may also be contributing." Bacterial cultures and electron microscopy
for viruses are pending.
Infection control measures, including isolating rabbits in individual
crates, have been implemented. All surviving rabbits are receiving
supportive care and empirical treatment as needed.
Rabbits at the other 2 captive breeding facilities -- Washington
State University (WSU) in Pullman, WA, and the Oregon Zoo in
Portland, OR -- are currently unaffected; 20 captive-bred pygmy
rabbits from these 2 institutions were released into a former pygmy
rabbit range yesterday [13 Mar 2007], marking the 1st time in 5 years
that they have occurred in the wild in Washington [state].
Approximately 100 pygmy rabbits remain in captivity at WSU and the Oregon Zoo.

[The information presented by Lorenzo Capucci and Antonio Lavazza of
OIE (World Animal Health Organization) is most interesting, but from
the initial pathology results, it appears that RHD can be ruled out.
We are thankful to Lorenzo Capucci, Antonio Lavazza, and Dr.
Mansfield for the informative update. - Mod.TG]
