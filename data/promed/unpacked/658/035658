South Korea: outbreak of suspected viral conjunctivitis
-------------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization on Thu 11 Sep 2003 downplayed the risks from
a highly infectious eye disease that has hit at least 66 000 South Koreans,
saying it is probably conjunctivitis and not deadly.
Hitoshi Oshitani, the WHO Western Pacific region's SARS outbreak team head
and communicable disease expert, said the organization is not issuing a
travel advisory notice. He said WHO is still verifying information about
the "pinkeye" disease's spread in South Korea. Several different viruses
can cause conjunctivitis, and it could be an airborne one. He said a
worldwide outbreak of conjunctivitis occurred in the 1970s, so a large
outbreak is possible.
The disease has hit South Korea ahead of a long holiday that began on
Wednesday, and health officials feared it would spread further as millions
of people jam buses, trains, and planes. A total of 19 746 new patients
were reported on Tue [9 Sep 2003], bringing the total to 66 700, South
Korea's Yonhap news agency said. It said the capital Seoul was the worst
affected, with 12 190 cases, followed by Gangwon and Gyeonggi provinces,
which reported 8012 and 7003, respectively.
The disease is characterized by bloodshot, itchy eyes and is sometimes
accompanied by muscular pain and headaches. Most of the infections were
reportedly acquired from contact with large groups. Health officials have
told school authorities to teach students to keep their hands clean and use
paper dispensers instead of towels. They also urged the public to increase
personal hygiene to prevent the spread of infections during the Chuseok
holiday. Millions of Koreans visit hometowns for traditional family
reunions during Korea's biggest festival.

[The identity of the infectious agent is unclear from this report. Further
information would be welcomed. Conjunctivitis may have many causes, and a
viral etiology cannot be assumed. Adenovirus type 11, coxsackievirus type
A24, and enterovirus type 70 are regularly associated with acute
conjunctivitis, and adenoviruses types 8, 19, and 37 with epidemic
keratoconjunctivitis. Since the conjunctiva and tear ducts are a major
portal of entry for respiratory viruses, other viruses may be implicated,
though less frequently. Recently a similar large scale outbreak of
conjunctivitis occurred in Algeria in the aftermath of a serious
earthquake, suggesting that other factors such as mechanical abrasion and
allergic reactions should also be taken into consideration. - Mod.CP]
