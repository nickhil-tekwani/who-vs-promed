Mumps continues to be a problem in the Bloomington-Normal area. The McLean County Health Department is reporting that Bloomington High School now has at least 3 cases of mumps, which qualifies as an outbreak at the school.

All of those in the county infected with the mumps are between the ages of 15 and 54. Increased mumps activity has also been reported at Normal West, University High School, Illinois State University and Heartland Community College.
