The number of wild animals testing positive for rabies in Erie County -- and several recent incidents of rabid animals biting residents -- led public health authorities on Friday [13 Jun 2014] to issue an alert about the problem.

To date in 2014, 13 animals -- 5 raccoons, 5 bats, and a cat, skunk and fox -- have tested positive for rabies in the county.

On Wednesday [11 Jun 2014], a rabid bat bit a 15-month-old West Seneca girl on the face in her bedroom. On Thursday [12 Jun 2014], a rabid raccoon bit a man in Alden when he attempted to stop the animal from attacking his dog. Also on Thursday, a Buffalo resident found a rabid bat in his home.

Rabies is caused by a virus that people and other mammals can get through exposure to the saliva or nervous tissue of a rabid animal, and if untreated, is almost always fatal, according to public health officials. The virus is preventable in pets by vaccinating them to protect against the disease.

"To stay safe, never handle a bat or any other wild animal," said Dr. Gale R. Burstein, Erie County health commissioner. "In addition, it is extremely important that all household pets receive rabies vaccinations."

Officials recommended that residents contact the county's Division of Environmental Health at 961-6800 if they come into contact with an animal that may have rabies.

[In the USA, there exist several wildlife variants of Lyssavirus that circulate in bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes and coyotes. It is very important to make sure to keep the vaccination schemes of all dogs and cats in the area up to date.
