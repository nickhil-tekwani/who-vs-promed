An outbreak of Lassa fever has killed 4 persons, just as 11 others are affected by the disease in Jos-North, Jos-South, and Bassa Local Government Areas of Plateau State. The state epidemiologist, Dr Raymond Juryit, who confirmed this to Daily Trust, said there was an outbreak of viral hemorrhagic Lassa fever in 3 local government areas and that so far, the state Ministry of Health has recorded 15 cases.

He decried challenges being faced in controlling the disease, saying, "Ribavirin is the only drug for the treatment of Lassa fever, but we don't have it right now. We usually receive them from Federal Ministry of Health every year, but we have not received any for this year [2014] yet. Doctors now resort to symptomatic treatment rather than curative treatment." He urged residents of the affected areas to maintain high personal hygiene and environmental sanitation, saying Lassa fever spreads rapidly in dirty environments. When contacted, the state commissioner for health, Dr Fom Dakwak, confirmed the outbreak, adding that some affected persons are at Bingham Teaching Hospital in Jos, and in dire need of the drugs.

He said: "It is true that there are no drugs in the state at the moment. We receive them from the Federal Ministry of Health and the state ministry has made several efforts to get the drugs to the patients. For the past 3 months, we have been trying to get the drugs from the ministry, but we have not been able to get them. Also, we cannot get the drugs in the market; they are produced by manufacturers based on orders by the Federal Ministry of Health. However, we are considering an alternative in order to arrest the situation."

[As noted in the 22 May 2014 post on Lassa fever in Nigeria (ProMED-mail archive no 20140522.2489540), Lassa fever virus is endemic in Nigeria and is now a serious problem in 23 of the 36 states of that country. As Mod.CP pointed out in his comment in archived report 20130131.1524034: "In the countries of Africa, such as Nigeria, where Lassa fever is endemic, the disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. While Lassa fever infection is normally mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 per cent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 per cent have a severe, multi-system disease. Exceptionally, Lassa fever is associated with epidemics, during which the case-fatality rate can reach 50 per cent. There is no preventative vaccine and treatment. The antiviral drug ribavirin has been used with success in Lassa fever patients."

The virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and causes acute hemorrhagic fever. It is transmitted to humans from contacts with food or household items contaminated with excreta of multimammate rats (_Mastomys_ spp.). Virus transmission can occur in houses or in hospital environments or laboratories in the absence of adequate infection control measures.

Images of _Mastomys_ mice can be seen at http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877.
