A case of bird flu or the H5N1 [avian influenza] virus has been found in the Nepali capital Kathmandu on Tue [27 Nov 2012]. The bird flu was found less than 6 months after the government of Nepal declared Nepal a bird flu free zone.

The virus was located in a squatters' area in Jadibuti at Kathmandu.

More than 500 ducks and chickens have been destroyed after the news of the disease. The locals informed the District Livestock Service Office after all the chickens in a house died at once.

Talking to Xinhua [News Agency], chief of District Livestock Service Office Bhaktapur Shiva Bahadur KC said, "The dead chickens were taken for a laboratory test where it was proven that they had died of bird flu."

This is the 1st instance of bird flu found in the capital city although it was previously found in other places of Nepal.

[The most recent officially reported HPAI H5 outbreak in Nepal dates back to 2 Nov 2012. The epidemiological comment was: "Reduced egg production with irregular shape and sized eggs was noticed in a commercial layer farm. High mortality was recorded in the affected farm. All remaining birds, poultry products, and poultry production materials were destroyed and the infected premises was cleaned and disinfected. Post-operative surveillance activities are continuing throughout the country. No further outbreaks have been recorded." The report, with map, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=12529.

The detection of an infected poultry backyard within the Capital (Kathmandu) illustrates the complexity of AI control; the immediate stamping out characterizes the policy applied in Nepal, with vaccination prohibited.
