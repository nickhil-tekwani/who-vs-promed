A farm in southern Cyprus has been cordoned off as sheep are tested
for foot-and-mouth disease [FMD], the government said Friday [26 Oct 2007].

Agriculture Minister Fotis Fotiou told The Associated Press that test
samples had been sent to the EU laboratory in Weybridge, England.
Results of the tests are expected Wednesday [31 Oct 2007. This
probably relates to final results; preliminary results should be
expected much earlier. - Mod.AS]

A 3-km (2-mile) cordon was placed around the farm at Dromolaxia,
outside the southern port city of Larnaca.

"There is no need for panic," Fotiou said. "We have taken the
necessary precautions." He said 15 000 farm animals were inside the
temporary control zone, which was set up Friday [26 Oct 2007].

[Results are anticipated earlier than Wednesday; in case FMD is --
hopefully -- excluded, bluetongue should be one of the diseases to be
considered in differential diagnosis.- Mod.AS
