China: 13 cases of H7N9 detected in central province
----------------------------------------------------
Beijing, Jan 20 (Prensa Latina) The number of people infected with H7N9 avian influenza in humans in central China''s Hunan province [has risen] to 13 this year as two new cases were detected, according to local authorities. According to the Hunan provincial disease control and prevention center, five people [have] died from the disease.

The last two patients, diagnosed on Thursday, are a 57 year old man from the Xinhua district and a 75 year old man from Chenzhou City.

The younger one, in a critical condition, had contact with poultry before becoming ill, while the other died on Wednesday, and is included in the five deaths for this cause that the province has recorded.

Other cases of human H7N9 infections have been reported in the Chinese provinces of Guangdong, Guizhou, Hubei, Henan, Jiangxi and Shandong, as well as in the Shanghai Municipality and in the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macao.

H7N9, a subtype of the bird flu virus, was first detected in humans in this country in March 2013 and health authorities link their spread to the winter and spring seasons.

Of the 5 reported fatalities in Hunan Province, 3 were elderly people over the age of 70, all had underlying conditions; a 59 year old victim had cerebrovascular disease; a 47 year old victim was somewhat obese. [Note that the underlying condition of the three who were over 70 appears to be their age. The previous paragraph says age over 60 is a risk factor for serious illness after infection by H7N9. - DS]
