Afghanistan's Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) on [Mon 3 Sep 2018] said that at least 34 people across the country have died after being diagnosed with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) - commonly known as Congo Fever.

"At least 34 people diagnosed with the virus have died in the past 5 months and another 250 people have received medical treatment," said the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH).

"Since the start of the month of Hamal [21 Mar 2018] until today [Mon 3 Sep 2018], 169 patients (have been treated)," said Assadullah Esmat, chairman of the Infectious Diseases Hospital in Kabul.

Meanwhile, members of the public have called on the ministry of public health to undertake a public awareness campaign to help people take necessary measures to avoid contracting the tick-borne virus. "People have contracted the virus through working with animals such as sheep and cows," said one patient being treated in Kabul. "I was diagnosed with the virus several days ago, I was feeling pain in my head and then my body," another patient said.

Key facts
---------
- CCHF virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks.
- CCHF outbreaks have a case fatality rate of up to 40 percent.
- The virus is primarily transmitted to people from ticks and livestock animals. Human-to-human transmission can occur resulting from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons.
- CCHF is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and Asia.
- There is no vaccine available for either people or animals.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), CCHF is a widespread disease caused by a tick-borne virus (Nairovirus) of the _Bunyaviridae_ family. The CCHF virus causes severe viral haemorrhagic fever outbreak and has a 10 to 40 percent fatality rate.

Signs and symptoms
------------------
The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually one to 3 days, with a maximum of 9 days. The incubation period following contact with infected blood or tissues is usually 5 to 6 days, with a documented maximum of 13 days.

Onset of symptoms is sudden, with fever, muscle ache, dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and sensitivity to light. There may be nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and sore throat early on.

In the absence of a vaccine, the only way to reduce infection in people is by raising awareness of the risk factors and educating people about the measures they can take to reduce exposure to the virus.

Public health advice should focus on several aspects
----------------------------------------------------
1.- Reducing the risk of tick-to-human transmission:
- wear protective clothing (long sleeves, long trousers);
- wear light coloured clothing to allow easy detection of ticks on the clothes;
- use approved acaricides (chemicals intended to kill ticks) on clothing;
- use approved repellent on the skin and clothing;
- regularly examine clothing and skin for ticks; if found, remove them safely;
- seek to eliminate or control tick infestations on animals or in stables and barns; and
- avoid areas where ticks are abundant and seasons when they are most active.

2.- Reducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission:
- wear gloves and other protective clothing while handling animals or their tissues in endemic areas, notably during slaughtering, butchering and culling procedures in slaughterhouses or at home;
- quarantine animals before they enter slaughterhouses or routinely treat animals with pesticides 2 weeks prior to slaughter.

3.- Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmission in the community:
- avoid close physical contact with CCHF-infected people.

[CCHF is a disease endemic to Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran as well as central Asian states. In addition to occupational exposures, cattle and personnel movement between the 1st 3 countries has led to the movement and spread of vectors (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25959153).

As animals with CCHF viremia do not exhibit clinical disease or morbidity, the control measures would principally include vector mapping by geographical regions and measures for vector control and increasing awareness among the high risk groups. The use of cross-border surveillance strategy can help map the spread of the virus, vector and their presence in asymptomatic cattle, which can facilitate appropriate control strategies. - Mod.UBA
