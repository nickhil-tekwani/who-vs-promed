Some Ontario swine flu victims kept in hospital for 3 months
------------------------------------------------------------
Some of the 1541 seriously ill patients have spent more than 3 months
in hospitals, the [Canadian] Ministry of Health reported in a weekly
bulletin. Ontario also says the case volume for swine flu [pandemic
(H1N1) 2009 virus infection} in the 2nd wave was up to 6 times higher
than the case load reached in the worst of the past 5 influenza
seasons going back all the way to 2004. The highest confirmed cases of
influenza in the past 5 flu seasons peaked at 500 cases in
mid-February of 2005 for the 2004-2005 seasonal flu outbreak. The peak
of the 2nd wave of swine flu reached some 2150 confirmed cases during
week 43.

Of the 1158 admitted to hospital between 1 Sep and 25 Nov 2009 -- the
2nd wave -- 222 remained hospitalized when the report was compiled;
and patients had a mean stay of 4 days but the range was between 0 to
94 days in hospital. 70 people died during the 2nd wave which is not
over yet and 25 died during the 1st wave which started in April
[2009], the report said.

A total of 8 of those hospitalized in the 1st wave remain in hospital.
"Admission to ICU [intensive care unit] and/or use of a ventilator was
reported for 21 percent (80) of wave one cases and 16 percent (186) of
wave 2 cases. Overall, 17 percent (266) of hospitalizations have been
admitted to ICU and/or placed on a ventilator. Fever, cough, shortness
of breath, vomiting, malaise, myalgia and sore throat/difficulty
swallowing have been the most commonly reported symptoms among
hospitalized cases," said the government report for the period ending
21 Nov 2009, but updated to 25 Nov 2009.

"16 new deaths were reported from 18 Nov 2009 to 25 Nov 2009 compared
to 18 new deaths reported from 12 Nov 2009 to 18 Nov 2009," said the
report.

- 101 of those hospitalized in Ontario were babies under one year old.
One infant died.

- 217 of those who were hospitalized were children aged 1 to 4 years.
There were no deaths in this group.

- 302 children between the ages of 5 to 14 were hospitalized. 5 died.

- 168 children and youths aged 15 to 24 were hospitalized. 7 died.

- 269 adults ranging in age from 25 to 44 were hospitalized with 16
deaths in this group.

- 343 people aged 45 to 64 were hospitalized, with 41 deaths in the age group.

- 141 people aged over 65 were hospitalized and they suffered the
highest death rate with 25 dead.

The figures suggest a higher hospitalization rate for younger children
but a higher fatality rate for older people.

[2] China: blood donation

City calls for blood in swine-flu war
-------------------------------------
Shanghai health authorities yesterday launched their latest drive in
the fight against swine flu [influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus
infection], calling on people who have been vaccinated against the
virus to donate blood for emergency-treatment storage. First in the
queue will be 34 inoculated medical staff at the Shanghai Public
Health Clinical Center, who are expected to donate blood today.

According to experts, a person starts to produce antibodies 3 weeks
after catching swine flu [influenza] or 2 weeks after vaccination.
Blood from these people can then be used to treat patients seriously
affected by the pandemic (H1N1) virus. "Using serum from vaccinated
staff to treat serious cases is mentioned in a treatment guide issued
by the Ministry of Health," said Dr Lu Hongzhou, a member of city's
expert panel on swine-flu treatment -- and one of the 34 expected
donors.

"The technology is safe and we have used it on our patients with good
results," Lu said. Since carrying out vaccinations on the most at-risk
groups of the population, such as medical staff, public servants and
students and teachers at primary and middle schools, Shanghai has
inoculated more than 800 000 people. A total of 2.1 million people
will be included in the vaccination plan, which has been expanded to
[include] university students and people aged 60 and over with local
residency.

By Monday, Shanghai had reported 2074 incidents of swine flu,
including 26 serious cases, since the 1st one was detected in May
[2009]. 2 young girls were still in critical condition in the city
yesterday with swine flu, while a Shanghai boy, aged 6, was off the
critical list and on the mend, officials from the Children's Hospital
of Fudan University said. A migrant girl, aged 3, from eastern China's
Anhui Province and a Shanghai girl, aged 6, were still on respirators,
the hospital said. The Anhui girl was showing stronger recovery signs,
said Wang Yi, the hospital's vice president. Since receiving the 1st
child seriously sickened by swine flu on 19 Nov 2009, the hospital has
treated 9 patients and 3 of them have recovered.

"We haven't used vaccinated people's serum in treating our child
patients as yet," Wang said.

[Use of donated blood from vaccinated individuals for treatment of
pandemic influenza patients could be a hazardous procedure requiring
rigorous monitoring to prevent the transmission of blood-borne
infections. This form of treatment does not seem to have been used
extensively so far to establish its potential efficacy and safety.
Further information on the application of this drastic approach would
be welcomed. - Mod.CP]

Request for information
-----------------------
I notice that an important piece of information is generally lacking
in the analysis of pandemic A(H1N1) infection cases: Have the people
who present with severe or lethal forms of the disease been previously
vaccinated with the seasonal vaccine, this year or before? As
different hypotheses have been evoked, from partial protection to
facilitation, I would welcome such information.

[4] WHO statement

WHO: It's too early to say pandemic has peaked
----------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization's (WHO's) top influenza expert said
today it's too soon to judge whether the H1N1 influenza pandemic has
passed its peak, though he acknowledged that cases are dropping in the
United States and Canada. "It's too early to say whether activity is
peaking in the Northern Hemisphere, and it's not possible to predict
what will happen in the spring," said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, special
adviser to the WHO director-general on pandemic flu.

In response to questions, Fukuda said it's premature for the WHO to
start formal discussions on whether the pandemic has crested. "In some
countries there are still increasing infections, even though there are
some countries, such as the United States and Canada, where infections
are going down," he said. Formal discussions on whether the pandemic
is waning won't come until "sometime in 2010," he said.

Recent reports indicate that that the 2nd wave of the pandemic is
ebbing in the United States and Canada. The latest report from the US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), covering the 3rd
week in November [2009], said physician visits for flu-like illness
dropped for the 4th straight week. And the Public Health Agency of
Canada said on 27 Nov 2009 that all provinces and territories had
reached "a possible epidemic peak."

The evidence from Europe is less clear. Today's update from the
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said
[pandemic] H1N1 deaths increased by 6 percent last week, signaling a
slower rise in mortality, as the toll had been nearly doubling every 2
weeks over the preceding 6 weeks. [The map presents the Qualitative
indicators of influenza activity (intensity, trend, geographical
spread and impact) and the dominant virus as assessed by each of the
countries can be viewed by accessing the maps at
<http://www.euroflu.org/cgi-files/bulletin_v2.cgi>. - Mod.CP]

In other comments today [3 Dec 2009], Fukuda said WHO has not
calculated a case-fatality rate (CFR) for the pandemic, after a
reporter noted that the CDC recently estimated the US CFR to be .018
percent. Fukuda said CFR estimates depend today, as in past pandemics,
mainly on gathering data on all deaths and then using modeling
techniques to estimate how many were flu-related. "People don't count
flu deaths on a one-to-one basis," he said.

"It's much too soon to have the kind of vital record health data
that's typically used to model estimates of overall [flu] deaths," he
added. "I think it'll take another 1 to 2 years after the pandemic to
collect this kind of data and come up with estimates. The WHO
estimates that 150 million doses of H1N1 vaccine have been distributed
in about 40 countries so far," Fukuda said. Meanwhile, the WHO
released a statement today to allay concerns it said have been voiced
in the news media that experts on some of the agency's advisory
committees have pharmaceutical industry ties that influence policy
decisions related to the pandemic. The statement says the WHO has
historically collaborated with the pharmaceutical industry because
efforts to improve health depend on access to effective and affordable
medicines, vaccines, and diagnostics. The agency said it has many
safeguards to identify and deal with potential conflicts of interest.

The statement also says public perceptions of the H1N1 pandemic have
been strongly influenced by the 5-year history of worry about the
deadly H5N1 avian influenza virus. "Adjusting public perceptions to
suit a far less lethal virus has been problematic," the Agency said.
"Given the discrepancy between what was expected and what has
happened, a search for ulterior motives on the part of the WHO and its
scientific advisers is understandable, though without justification."

In the briefing, Fukuda emphasized the necessity of the WHO's
collaboration with many partners, including private companies, though
he didn't mention media criticisms. "It's the private sector that
makes vaccine," he said. "Most vaccine is not made by governments but
by companies in the private sector, both in developed and developing
countries. It's this group which has unique knowledge of vaccines
because they manufacture them. It's essential for public health to
access this knowledge."

[Perhaps the most revealing statement is Dr. Fukuda's comment that:

virus. Adjusting public perceptions to suit a far less lethal virus
has been problematic." - Mod.CP]
