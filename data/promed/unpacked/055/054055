Bluetongue disease returns to Sardinia
--------------------------------------
151 new foci of bluetongue have been detected in the Cagliari region. A
clinical case,initially recorded in Carbonia on 25 Aug 2003, was finally
confirmed on 15 Sep 2003. There is fear that the disease may take
catastrophic dimensions as it did during 2000 and 2001, when half a million
sheep died in Sardinia [see comment]. The health authorities have declared
today that the situation is "under control". The regional farmers
associations have urged the authorities to maintain high alertness, to
continue all prophylactic measures and the implementation of the previous
policy -- indemnifying farmers affected by the disease. It has been
suggested that the prevailing warm weather has contributed to the severity
of the disease.
Maurizio Onorato, the leader of Associazione Agricola, the regional farmers
association, has stated that all efforts are being undertaken to prevent
the spread of the disease from the recently detected foci.
The isolated virus is of serotype 4 rather than serotype 2, which was
responsible for the epidemic of 2000. Serotype 4 seems to be less virulent
than serotype 2 and seems to be controllable. Animal movement restrictions
have been applied within the affected area. Notifications have been
distributed to all municipalities and to the farmers. The Ministry of
[Animal? - Mod.JW] Health has been requested to urgently approve
vaccinations. In 2001, all susceptible animals (sheep, goats, and cattle)
were vaccinated, and they were revaccinated in 2003.
41 of the 151 infected flocks are situated in Sanluri, 108 in Carbonia, and
2 in Cagliari. 114 sheep have died so far -- 49 in Sanluri, 64 in Carbonia,
and one in Cagliari. Several of the diseased animals have recovered.
Bluetongue virus of serotype 2 has been previously recorded in Calabria
(Sicily), and in earlier years in Greece, Turkey, and Israel. It has never
been recorded in North Africa. Efforts are invested in detecting the origin
of the virus and its route of introduction into Sardinia. The emergence of
new disease foci has caused the Sardinian farmers great anxiety.

[According to information received by the Office International des
Epizooties (OIE) on 10 Feb 2003 from Dr Paolo Calistri and Professor
Vicenzo Caporale, Instituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del
Molise "G. Caporale", Teramo, Italy (OIE Collaborating Centre for
Epidemiology and Organisation of Veterinary Services in Developing
Countries), bluetongue has caused the following total losses since its
first detection in Italy in 2000 and during the following 3 seasons (in
brackets -- figures related to Sardinia):
Number of affected flocks: 14 094 (12 364)
Diseased animals: 517 088 (486 114)
Dead: 124 281 (119 950)
Killed: 401 373 (373 686)
(See: Bluetongue in Italy: a brief description of the epidemiological
situation and the control measures applied. OIE Bulletin 2003; 2: 15-7).
Clearly, bluetongue has been causing tremendous losses in Italy; 94 per
cent of the clinical cases and more than 96 per cent of the mortalities
occurred in Sardinia. It seems that the Sardinian sheep breed exhibits
significant susceptibility to the bluetongue virus. Interestingly, this has
already been recorded in the past, namely in A Komarov's paper, which
described the first identification of bluetongue in Israel in
September/October 1950 (Refuah Veterinarith 1951; 8(3): 100). The author
stated: "As for sheep, the disease occurred both in local sheep of the
Awassi breed and in Sardinian sheep which had been imported in October,
1949. In certain flocks only the latter showed clinical symptoms and in
general it may be said that the disease appeared in its most severe form in
Sardinian sheep, which seemed to be rather susceptible". - Mod.AS]
