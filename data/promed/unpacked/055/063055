15 Illnesses Linked to Central Florida Festivals
---------------------------------------------
State health officials said Fri, 25 Mar 2005, that at least 15
people, 11 of them children, who visited Central Florida festivals,
have since tested positive for a dangerous strain of _E. coli_ or a
potentially fatal kidney disease caused by the bacterium.
While local health officials have said the cases appeared to be
linked to petting zoos at the festivals, state Health Secretary John
Agwunobi cautioned that the apparent outbreak has not been
definitively linked to touching animals. The bacterium also could
have been contracted from eating tainted food or from some other
activity, Agwunobi said.
The 15 people being monitored by the state Health Department all
visited either the Central Florida Fair in Orlando or the Florida
Strawberry Festival in Plant City. All have had diarrhea and have
either tested positive for the particular _E. coli_ strain or
developed the kidney disease known as hemolytic uremic syndrome, or
HUS.

[As expected, those individuals affected did have diarrhea and at
least some at this point have been found to be culture-positive for
_E. coli_ O157:H7. - Mod.LL]
