[The previously undiagnosed deaths in the town of Etoumbi in the
Cuvette-Ouest region of the Republic of Congo have now been attributed to
infection with Ebola haemorrhagic fever virus, consequently a change in the
heading for this thread is necessitated: The heading "Undiagnosed deaths,
etc." now becomes "Ebola hemorrhagic fever, etc". - Mod.CP]

Congo Republic: Ebola-hit Town Quarantined
------------------------------------------
A town at the centre of an outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever in the
Republic of Congo has been cordoned off but the number of cases of the
deadly disease had not changed, a World Health Organisation (WHO) official
said on Thursday [19 May 2005].

"The head of the district has placed Etoumbi in quarantine. Nothing goes in
or out of the locality anymore, and the government will bring food for the
population from tomorrow," said Adamou Yada, WHO's representative in Congo.
The latest outbreak of the viral infection has already killed 9 people
since the end of April 2005 in the forested northwestern Cuvette-Ouest
region, where nearly 150 people died from Ebola haemorrhagic fever in 2003.
Neighbouring Gabon also had outbreaks in 2001 and 2002.

Yada said 2 other people infected with the [virus] appeared to be
recovering. He said the number of people being monitored for the disease
had dropped to 65 from around 80. There is no known cure for Ebola, which
is passed on by infected body fluids and kills between 50 and 90 percent of
victims, depending on the strain. Ebola damages blood vessels and can cause
bleeding, diarrhoea and shock.

The worst outbreak [of Ebola], in 1995, killed more than 250 people in the
Democratic Republic of Congo [formerly Zaire]. "I hope this epidemic will
be the shortest we have known in Cuvette-Ouest, simply because the local
people have taken precautions since the very beginning," Yada said, adding
that information campaigns appeared to be bearing fruit.

Scientists think past outbreaks in Cuvette-Ouest, near the border with
Gabon, were caused by the consumption of infected monkey meat. Bushmeat is
a staple among forest communities in West and Central Africa and a delicacy
in many cities. In the Sangha region bordering Cuvette-Ouest, local
authorities urged people to report anyone seen selling or transporting meat
from primates. People who reported infractions would get a portion of the
fine levied on the culprits.

Republic of Congo: Outbreak of Ebola Fever Attributed to Consumption of
Bushmeat
-------------------------------------------------
The town at the centre of an outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever virus in
Congo has been sealed off to stop the disease spreading, health officials
say. 9 people have died in the north-western town of Etoumbi, near forests
where there have been at least 3 Ebola outbreaks in recent years.

World Health Organization Congo director Amadou Yada said food would be
delivered to the town on Friday [20 May 2005]. "The head of the district
has placed Etoumbi in quarantine. Nothing goes in or out of the locality
anymore," Dr Yada said. He said that no more cases had been reported in
recent days. "I hope this epidemic will be the shortest we have known in
Cuvette West, simply because the local people have taken precautions since
the very beginning," he said.

The outbreak began when villagers went to the forest to hunt elephants and
came across the body of a dead chimpanzee, which they took home to eat,
before becoming sick, officials say. The BBC's Christian Tsoumou in the
Congo capital, Brazzaville, says that most people in the forest area are
hunters and bushmeat is seen as a delicacy.

He says that after previous Ebola outbreaks in the area, the authorities
have told people not to touch dead animals they find, but few people take
any notice. Ebola is highly contagious and is spread through body fluids,
such as blood and sweat. In 2003, 120 people died from Ebola in Cuvette West.
