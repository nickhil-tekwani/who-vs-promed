Regional Update -- Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Weekly Update Summary
-------------------------------------------------------------
- In North America, acute respiratory disease
activity continued to decrease and is lower than expected in some areas
- In the Caribbean, all countries reported
unchanged and decreasing trends in acute respiratory disease
- Central America reported decreasing or
unchanged trends in acute respiratory disease
- South American countries reported mostly
decreasing trends of acute respiratory disease
- A median of 99.6 percent of subtyped influenza
A viruses in North America were pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus
- Since 18 Dec 2009: 203 new confirmed deaths in
8 countries were reported; in total there have
been 6880 cumulative confirmed deaths

The information contained within this update is
obtained from data provided by Ministries of
Health of Member States and National Influenza
Centers through reports sent to Pan American
Health Organization (PAHO) or updates on their web pages.

I - Evolution of the pandemic
-----------------------------

North America
-------------
In Canada, in epidemiological week number 50 (EW
50), the national influenza-like illness (ILI)
consultation rate remained below the historical
average for the 2nd consecutive week. The overall
number of hospitalizations, ICU [intensive care
unit] admissions, and deaths associated with the
pandemic (H1N1) virus decreased approximately 50
percent as compared to the prior week (EW 49). A
total of 9 oseltamivir-resistant isolates have been detected since April 2009.

In Mexico, from EW 49 to EW 50, there was a 53
percent decrease in the number ILI and severe
acute respiratory illness (SARI) cases, and the
activity has now been decreasing for 8
consecutive weeks. The intensity of acute
respiratory disease, however, was high.

In the United States, the proportion of
outpatient consultations for ILI decreased in EW
50 but increased in EW 51, remaining above the
national baseline. In EW 50, 3 of 10 and in EW
51, 5 of 10, sub-national surveillance regions
reported the proportion of outpatient visits for
ILI to be above their region-specific baseline.
Laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalization
rates remained stable but high, especially in
children 0Â­4 years of age. The proportion of
deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza
dropped below (EW 50) but then increased above
(EW 51) the epidemic threshold. A total of 9
influenza-associated pediatric deaths were
reported in EW 50 and 4 in EW 51; 10 of these
were associated with the pandemic virus. A total
of 50 oseltamivir-resistant isolates have been detected since April 2009.

Caribbean
---------
In EW 50 and 51, these countries reported
decreasing or unchanged trends in acute
respiratory disease, low/moderate intensity of
acute respiratory disease and low or moderate
impact of acute respiratory disease on health
care services. In countries providing these data,
for the 3 consecutive weeks (EW 47 to 49), SARI
hospitalization incidence decreased.
[Participating CAREC member countries, which
include, Barbados, Bahamas, Jamaica, St Vincent
and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago, were assessed together].

Central America
---------------
In EW 50 and 51, these countries reported
decreasing or unchanged trends in acute
respiratory disease, low/moderate intensity of
acute respiratory disease and low impact of acute
respiratory disease on health care services.

Guatemala (EW 50) reported a decrease of 15
percent and 17.6 perecent of acute respiratory
disease cases and pneumonia cases, respectively, as compared to the prior week.

South America
-------------
Andean region. Most of these countries reported
widespread influenza activity in EW 50 and 51.
Acute respiratory disease trends were reported as
decreasing, except in Peru, which reported an
increasing trend in EW 50, but a decreasing trend
in EW 51. The intensity of acute respiratory
disease and the impact of acute respiratory
disease on health-care services were reported as
low or moderate for these countries. In Peru,
nationally, the peak of SARI was in EW 28, and
since EW 34 there has been a consistently decreasing trend.

Southern Cone: Influenza activity was reported as
widespread in Argentina (EW 48) and regional in
Brazil (EW 50, 51). These countries reported
continued decreasing trends of acute respiratory
disease, low/moderate intensity of acute
respiratory disease, and low or moderate impact
of acute respiratory disease on health-care
services. In EW 48, Argentina reported decreasing
ILI activity in 15 of 20 regions (information was
not available for 3 regions). The incidence of
ILI continued to be low (7 per 100 000 habitants)
and has been below the epidemic threshold since EW 40.

description of hospitalizations and deaths among
confirmed cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus
infection can be viewed via the URL at the
beginning of this report. The ratio of males to
females among hospitalized cases was
approximately one. Hospitalizations were highest
in children and young adults. Underlying
comorbidities were present in approximately 50
percent of hospitalized cases. - Mod.CP]
