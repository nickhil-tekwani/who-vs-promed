Officials in a Mexican state have issued a warning after suspicions that more than 50 people fell sick from eating meat contaminated with clenbuterol.

Health services in Morelos called on people to remain vigilant for the physical symptoms resulting from consuming meat with clenbuterol. A total of 54 people from 6 municipalities are affected, and one person is in a stable condition in hospital.

Clenbuterol has been used as a food additive in some livestock feed to promote muscle mass and meat yield in cattle, lamb, poultry, and swine. Such use is illegal in the US and Europe.

Use of the anabolic agent for cattle fattening is a criminal offence under the Federal Animal Health Law, according to the Mexican National Service for Agro-Alimentary Public Health, Safety and Quality (SENASICA). The agency operates programs that certify the work of meat producers, fatteners, storers and processors to stop use of clenbuterol in the feeding of bovine cattle for human consumption. From almost 3800 samplings at production sites in 2019, only 5 positives were confirmed.

Clenbuterol symptoms can include headaches, increased sweating, insomnia, nausea, possible muscle spasms, and increased blood pressure. They usually occur shortly after consuming contaminated food and disappear 2-6 days later.

Eduardo Sesma Medrano, from the Morelos public health agency, said if after consuming meat products, people experience issues such as tachycardia, anxiety, and trembling of hands or fingers, it is a priority to go immediately to the nearest health center.

Sesma Medrano said the symptoms are warning signs to seek medical attention, especially for people suffering from heart disease, as it can be dangerous and possibly fatal.

In the municipalities of Jantetelco, Jonacatepec, Cuautla, Ayala, Atlatlahucan, and Tepalcingo, 54 suspected cases of clenbuterol poisoning were detected. In total, 39 were treated on an outpatient basis, while 15 required hospitalization in different medical units, but 14 of these patients have already been discharged.

Asuncion Virginia Munoz Rangel, head of the Commission for the Protection against Sanitary Risks of the State of Morelos (Coprisem), said an investigation was started to find the origin of contaminated meat.

Two points of sale in the area have been visited to carry out sanitary surveillance and obtain samples to analyze and determine if there is the presence of clenbuterol in products.

As part of a thesis in 2019, Aaron Valencia Garcia of the Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Morelos analyzed samples of bovine meat products (muscle and liver) from different areas in the city of Cuernavaca, Morelos, and determined presence of clenbuterol residues.

In total, 88 samples of beef muscle (leg) and 18 samples of beef liver were collected and analyzed from municipal markets, butchers, and self-service stores. Of all 106 samples analyzed, 52 had clenbuterol residues. The amounts found also exceeded the maximum recommended limits by the Codex Alimentarius of 0.2 micrograms per kilogram for beef muscle and 0.6 micrograms per kilogram for beef liver.

[Clenbuterol is a sympathomimetic amine with a number of different activities, including smooth-muscle-relaxing properties, which means it can relax bronchioles and be effective in the treatment of asthma and asthma-like conditions. A beta-2 agonist, it is sold as a clenbuterol hydrochloride for treatment of asthma and other obstructive respiratory conditions to open airways in people and animals.

Clenbuterol also has anabolic effects, encouraging the body to make lean muscle instead of fat in both humans and animals. Body builders and athletes have used it in an attempt to gain a competitive advantage and it has been used in cattle, pigs, sheep, and goats to make the animals appear more muscled in livestock shows. It's also been fed to food-producing animals to cause them to gain more lean body mass.

The drug has a very long half-life and can be found in various locations in the body of animals or humans months after consumption. Clenbuterol residues can affect lung and heart function in persons who have eaten liver or meat of animals given the drug. In the United States, no human illnesses have been associated with clenbuterol use in food animals. But several outbreaks of reversible, short-term illnesses in Europe have been traced to ingesting clenbuterol residues in European beef liver.

Clenbuterol can be deadly when used incorrectly. Like anabolic steroids, it can affect the nervous system and the heart. The drug can cause nervousness, twitching, heart palpitations, blood pressure fluctuations, and death.

When animals are fed this product, they do produce more lean muscle, but when people consume the meat of these animals, they can become ill due to neurological and cardiac complications.

Just as athletes are forbidden to use clenbuterol in many sports, many countries have also stopped the feeding of the product to food-producing animals because of incidents involving the hearts of some consumers. - Mod.TG
