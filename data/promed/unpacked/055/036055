The FDA and state and local officials investigated a case of tetrodotoxin poisoning in Fairfax County, VA which is believed to be linked to the consumption of imported puffer fish that was not processed and prepared by specially trained and certified fish cutters as part of an agreement between the USA and Japan. The liver, gonads (ovaries and testes), intestines, and skin of some puffer fish contain the toxins tetrodotoxin and/or saxitoxin.

According to Fairfax County Health Department authorities, the individual who developed tetrodotoxin poisoning received the puffer fish in a package from relatives in South Korea rather than purchasing it from a restaurant or other retail outlet in the USA.

Symptoms resulting from ingesting tetrodotoxin and/or saxitoxin include tingling of the lips and mouth followed by dizziness, tingling in the extremities, problems with speaking, balance, muscle weakness and paralysis, vomiting, and diarrhea. These symptoms can begin anywhere from 20 minutes to 2 hours after eating the toxic fish. In extreme cases, death can result from respiratory paralysis.

Consumers should only eat puffer fish (also known as fugu, bok, blowfish, globefish, swellfish, balloonfish, or sea squab) from 2 known safe sources. The safe sources are:
- Imported puffer fish that have been processed and prepared by specially trained and certified fish cutters in the city of Shimonoseki, Japan, and
- Puffer fish caught in the mid-Atlantic coastal waters of the USA, typically between Virginia and New York. Puffer fish from all other sources potentially contain deadly toxins and, therefore, are not considered safe.

The Japanese government licenses specially trained fish cutters to process and prepare puffer fish. These fish are imported into the USA 2 to 3 times per year for special occasions by only one approved New York importer, Wako International, under an FDA/Japanese government agreement. This is the only source of imported puffer fish that is covered by such an agreement. They are sold only to restaurants, and dishes containing the fish are often very expensive, sometimes costing hundreds of dollars for a full meal. Any puffer fish not imported pursuant to the agreement between the USA and Japan is subject to FDA's Import Alert 16-20, which informs FDA field staff that they may detain the fish without physical examination.

Puffer fish caught from the mid-Atlantic coastal waters of the USA do not contain these deadly toxins and are considered safe to eat. They are less expensive than imported puffer fish and may be found in markets or restaurants. However, puffer fish caught off the east coast of Florida should not be eaten because the entire fish is potentially toxic.

Before ordering or buying puffer fish, consumers should ask where it came from to ensure that it is from a known safe source. Consumers who are unsure of the source should not eat puffer fish.

[The following was extracted from the "Bad Bug Book;" http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/chap39.html:

Fish poisoning by consumption of members of the order Tetraodontiformes is one of the most violent intoxications from marine species. The gonads, liver, intestines, and skin of pufferfish can contain levels of tetrodotoxin sufficient to produce rapid and violent death. The flesh of many pufferfish may not usually be dangerously toxic.

Tetrodotoxin has also been isolated from widely differing animal species, including the California newt, parrotfish, frogs of the genus _Atelopus_, the blue-ringed octopus, starfish, angelfish, and xanthid crabs. The metabolic source of tetrodotoxin is uncertain. No algal source has been identified, and until recently tetrodotoxin was assumed to be a metabolic product of the host. However, recent reports of the production of tetrodotoxin/anhydrotetrodotoxin by several bacterial species, including strains of the family _Vibrionaceae_, _Pseudomonas sp._, and _Photobacterium phosphoreum_, point toward a bacterial origin of this family of toxins. These are relatively common marine bacteria that are often associated with marine animals. If confirmed, these findings may have some significance in toxicoses that have been more directly related to these bacterial species.

The 1st symptom of intoxication is a slight numbness of the lips and tongue, appearing between 20 minutes to 3 hours after eating poisonous pufferfish. The next symptom is increasing paresthesia in the face and extremities, which may be followed by sensations of lightness or floating. Headache, epigastric pain, nausea, diarrhea, and/or vomiting may occur. Occasionally, some reeling or difficulty in walking may occur. The 2nd stage of the intoxication is increasing paralysis. Many victims are unable to move; even sitting may be difficult. There is increasing respiratory distress. Speech is affected, and the victim usually exhibits dyspnea [shortness of breath], cyanosis [turns blue], and hypotension [drop in blood pressure]. Paralysis increases, and convulsions, mental impairment, and cardiac arrhythmia [alterations in heartbeat] may occur.

The victim, although completely paralyzed, may be conscious and in some cases completely lucid until shortly before death. Death usually occurs within 4 to 6 hours, with a known range of about 20 minutes to 8 hours. - Mod.LL
