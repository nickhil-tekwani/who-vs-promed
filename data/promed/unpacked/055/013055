Chemical Fertilizer Use Associated with High Mosquito Larvae Densities
----------------------------------------------------------------------
PARIS: India's extensive use of chemical fertilizers on its rice fields is
fueling mosquito-borne epidemics of Japanese encephalitis, the British
weekly New Scientist reports in its latest issue.
Researchers from India's Institute of Vector Control and Zoonoses at Hosur,
near the southern city of Bangalore, tested these fertilizers on 60 square
metre plots. When the recommended dose of 100 kg of fertilizer per hectare
was applied, plots had more than double the number of mosquito larvae
compared with plots that were sprayed with bio-fertilizers or had no
fertilizer at all.
This concurs with data showing that Japanese encephalitis was virtually
unknown in India until 1970, when use of inorganic fertilizers in fields
with high-yield varieties of rice began to soar. In Tamil Nadu alone, the
article in Saturday's issue of New Scientist says, farmers used 791 000
tons of the chemicals in 1996-97 compared with 296 000 tons in 1970-71.
The problem is that when only organic fertilizers are used, yields from
these 'super-strains' of rice plummet, the scientists found. The solution
is a mixture of chemical fertilizer and an organic fertilizer of blue-green
algae which captures nitrogen naturally, they say. Plots using this
mixture had only 50 per cent more mosquito larvae than control plots, but
had better yields than before. Japanese encephalitis is a viral disease
transmitted by mosquito bites that kills about 15 000 people worldwide each
year but leaves thousands more with permanent brain damage.

[This is an interesting analysis of a relationship between agricultural
fertilizer use and density of mosquito larvae in rice fields. It is
perhaps too simplistic to advance this as the explanation for the
appearance and emergence of Japanese encephalitis in India. Japanese
encephalitis was first recognized in India in 1955 and since then major
outbreaks have been reported from different parts of the country,
predominantly rural areas. Children are mainly affected, with morbidity
rate estimated at 0.30 to 1.5 per 100 000 population. Case fatality rate
has ranged from 10% to 60%, and up to 50% of those who recover may be left
with neurological deficits. Many ecological factors have been shown to
affect the abundance of the mosquito vectors, and the interactions between
these factors are complex. Furthermore Japanese encephalitis is a zoonosis
with the primary cycle occurring in invertebrate vectors (mosquitoes) and
vertebrate animals (primarily the pig), with man being only an incidental
host. Indeed, the density of pig husbandry has been suggested as a
relevant factor in the incidence of Japanese encephalitis in some parts of
rural India. - Mod.CP]
