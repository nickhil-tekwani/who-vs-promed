Tanzania Warned About Prawns Farming Hazards
The government-owned newspaper, Daily News, reported Thursday that Tanzania
had been advised to weigh the ecological hazards that could arise from the
prawns farming project at Rufiji delta on the Indian Ocean coast, 300 km
south of Dar es Salaam. This warning was given on Wednesday in Mombasa at a
three day East African regional workshop on mangroves and shrimp farming
attended by delegates from Kenya, India, Mozambique, the United States of
America and Tanzania.
Several participants claimed that prawn farming has "always" caused misery
to the immediate population and irreparable ecological disasters to many
parts of the world.
An Indian expert, Jacob Raj, warned that the proposed Rufiji prawns
projects should be looked on from all aspects. He said that Tanzanian
authorities might have been manipulated and ill-advised by major actors in
the prawn industry. Raj has been campaigning against shrimp farming in
India for six years. Eventually the Indian Supreme Court banned the prawns
fishing in December 1996.
It was revealed at the Mombasa workshop that Asian countries which
undertook large scale commercial shrimp farming had suffered from serious
ecological problems, diseases, and water contamination. The most affected
countries were Taiwan, China, and the Philippines.
An American expert, Alfredo Quatro told the workshop that the commercial
shrimp industry causes several problems, including pollution, environmental
destruction, coastal deforestation and soil erosion.
