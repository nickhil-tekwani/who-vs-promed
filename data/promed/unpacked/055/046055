WEST NILE VIRUS: CLINICAL DETAILS (02)

A ProMED post

[ProMED asked:
... since no mention is made of rash among the symptoms (in the above
ref.), is it correct that it was a rare finding in your patients?]
Please excuse me for answering you so late to your e-mail
message of 2 Oct 1999. During 5-10 October I participated in the
first Conference of the Balkan Society for Microbiology in Plovdiv,
Bulgaria, so I missed [my e-mail] from Bucharest.
The paper you refer to from Romanian Journal of Virology is a
report on the cases hospitalised in one of the hospitals of
infectious diseases only. The cumulated data I reported in our
Seminar summarised the cases for all over the country and
published extensively in the paper by Tsai T.F., Popovici F.,
Cernescu C, Campell G, Ion-Nedelcu N. West Nile encephalitis
epidemic in South-Eastern Romania. The Lancet, 1998, 767-772.
The "rash" you are asking about was mentioned to be present in
some cases hospitalized during the outbreak of 1997, but the
percentage was not mentioned in four papers that I consulted.
