A suspected anthrax tainted dead cow is being blamed for the death of a 5-year-old child at Mategeta village in Narok South Sub-County Saturday [23 Aug 2014], according to the Kenyan news source, Standard Media. It is reported that the child and at least 2 adults became infected after consuming the dead cow meat.

The 2 adults are currently admitted at Narok County Hospital. Health officials fear more deaths are likely to occur because many more people took the tainted beef home.

The 3 cases above come after locals defied orders from public health officers who had told them not to consume the meat after 3 cows died.

Anthrax is a serious infectious disease caused by Gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria known as _Bacillus anthracis_. Anthrax can be found naturally in soil and commonly affects domestic and wild animals around the world. Although it is rare, people can get sick with anthrax if they come in contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products.

[Narok is a county in western Kenya on the border with Tanzania; see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narok_County.

Anthrax is reported sporadically in Kenya, at a fraction of its true incidence. This is nicely shown by this incident where the public health folk are advising the villagers about the meat from the 3 carcasses that should have been condemned and burnt by the veterinary service. This incident is all too common in Africa, unfortunately. - Mod.MHJ
