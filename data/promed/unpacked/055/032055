[The city of Irkutsk is near the border with Mongolia in the South Eastern
portion of Siberia. It's located 4210 kms from Moscow, 2046 kms from
Birobidzhan (see alert in Russian Far East) and 1655 km from Beijing. -MPP
Seven cases of tick-borne encephalitis [probably Russian Spring-Summer
encephalitis, caused by a flavivirus of the same name. - Mod.CC and three
cases of a tick-borne fever [etiologic agent? have been recorded here
since the beginning of this month.
The diseases have been promoted by hot weather and a massive outflow of
city folk into the country at the beginning of the month. In the period May
3-9 alone, 227 people, among them 199 children, applied to polyclinics for
medical aid, complaining of tick bites.
Doctors also have an unfavorable forecast for the end of the month and
beginning of June, anticipating hot weather.
