Cases of Buruli ulcer -- known colloquially as the 'flesh-eating bug' -- have begun appearing in the suburbs of Geelong [Victoria] as the painful disease continues to spread.

The number of cases is on the rise and cases are being reported in areas where it has never previously been seen, including Aireys Inlet, Belmont, Frankston, and Rye.

Local councils are increasing mosquito spraying programs while on the Mornington Peninsula, researchers are laying mosquito traps that attract female mozzies but prevent their eggs from hatching.

21 cases of Buruli ulcer have been recorded in Victoria this year [2021], compared to 12 in the 1st 6 weeks of 2020.

The disease causes a range of symptoms ranging from mild inflammation at the site of a mosquito bite to large, open sores or ulcers that can lead to limb amputation in severe cases.

Buruli ulcer is thought to be transmitted by mosquito and has an incubation period of 3 to 5 months.

It is most prevalent around Victoria's Bellarine and Mornington Peninsulas.

Buruli ulcer is a skin infection caused by the bacterium _Mycobacterium ulcerans_ (_M. ulcerans_), usually presenting as a slowly developing painless nodule or papule which can initially be mistaken for an insect bite. Over time the lesion can progress to develop into a destructive skin ulcer which is known as Buruli ulcer or Bairnsdale ulcer.

The highest risk is associated with the active transmission areas of Rye, Sorrento, Blairgowrie, and Tootgarook on the Mornington Peninsula. There is a moderate risk associated with areas in the Bellarine Peninsula (Ocean Grove, Barwon Heads, Point Lonsdale, Queenscliff), Frankston, and Seaford areas. There is a low risk associated with the rest of the Bellarine and Mornington Peninsula, the South Eastern Bayside suburbs, and East Gippsland. Together, all these areas are considered the endemic parts of Victoria for Buruli ulcer transmission.

Cases from Aireys Inlet on the Surf Coast and the Geelong suburb of Belmont in 2019 suggested that these are emerging areas of local transmission.

The recent detection of _M. ulcerans_ in Melbourne's inner north means this location is a new area of interest. This is the 1st non-coastal area in Victoria to be recognised as a potential area of risk, however, the risk of transmission in these areas is considered low. All the identified cases had also travelled to known risk areas for Buruli ulcer but genetic analysis of _M. ulcerans_ isolated from them strongly supports a common link. The potential source of _M. ulcerans_ in Melbourne's inner north has not been established, although the bacteria were isolated from the faeces of a local possum.

The disease is not transmissible from person to person and there is no evidence of transmission from possums directly to humans.

Evidence to date suggests that mosquitoes play a role in the transmission of _M. ulcerans_. The species of mosquito which has been implicated in other areas of Victoria is _Aedes notoscriptus_ (_Ae. notoscriptus_), which is known to breed in open containers with pooled water. Discarded car and truck tyres, open tins or cans, buckets, and untreated pools, and other still or standing water are breeding grounds for this species of mosquito.

[The 1st news report above says that the incidence of Buruli ulcer is increasing are communities surrounding the city of Melbourne in the Australian state of Victoria and being reported in areas where it has not previously been seen, including Aireys Inlet, Belmont, Frankston, and Rye. The 2nd report above mentions additional sites, including Melbourne's inner north.

The Bellarine, on the west, and Mornington, on the east, are peninsulas that surround Port Phillip Bay, on which the city of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, is located. A narrow inlet, called the Rip, 3.5 km (2.1 mi) wide, separates the 2 peninsulas (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rip). The Mornington Peninsula includes small towns on its western shorelines that are sometimes regarded as outlying suburbs of greater Melbourne (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mornington_Peninsula). Most of the Bellarine Peninsula is a part of the city of Greater Geelong (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellarine_Peninsula). Melbourne, located between the 2 peninsulas, with a population of about 4.6 million residents, is the capital and most populous city in the Australian state of Victoria and is the 2nd most populous city in Australia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne).

Belmont is a southern suburb of Geelong; Airey's Inlet is on the coast south of the Bellarine Peninsula; Rye and Frankston are on the Mornington Peninsula. A map showing the location of these towns can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Belmont+VIC+3216,+Australia.

Buruli ulcer (also known as the Bairnsdale ulcer) is a chronic debilitating skin and soft tissue infection with large ulcers usually on the legs or arms that can lead to bone infection and permanent disfigurement and disability. It initially presents as a nodule or large painless area of induration or a diffuse painless swelling of the legs, arms or face.

It is caused by _Mycobacterium ulcerans_, which needs a temperature between 29-33 C [84.2-91.4 F] and a low (2.5 per cent) oxygen concentration to grow in vitro (http://jcm.asm.org/content/36/11/3420.full). The organism produces a unique toxin -- mycolactone -- which causes tissue damage and inhibits the immune response. Local immunosuppressive properties of the mycolactone toxin enable the disease to progress with no pain and fever. The diagnosis can be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), direct microscopy, histopathology, and culture.

Although the exact mode of transmission of _M. ulcerans_ is still unknown, _M. ulcerans_ is thought to be acquired from the environment, and this organism has been found in the feces of possums in Buruli ulcer-endemic areas of Victoria (ProMED post Buruli ulcer - Australia: (VI) M. ulcerans, possum feces 20140913.2771412), where mosquitoes may be vectors (Lavender CJ, Fyfe JA, Azuolas J, et al: Risk of Buruli ulcer and detection of _Mycobacterium ulcerans_ in mosquitoes in south eastern Australia. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2011; 5(9): e1305. Epub 2011 Sep 20; https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0001305). _M. ulcerans_ is not thought to be transmitted person-to-person (ProMED post Buruli ulcer - Liberia (02): (BG) comment, RFI 20141028.2908743).

About 2000 Buruli ulcer cases per year are reported worldwide, most commonly from the tropical regions of West or Central Africa. In Australia, most cases are reported from the southeastern state of Victoria, the only non-tropical part of the world where Buruli ulcer is detected.
