RIYADH, July 24 (AFP) - Saudi Arabia has upgraded health measures
on the border with Iraq to guard the kingdom against a new outbreak of
Rift Valley Fever, the Health Minister said in remarks published
Tuesday [24 Jul 2001.
Osama Shobokshi said the World Health Organisation (WHO)
cautioned the kingdom 4 days ago to take precautionary measures
against the disease after a number of cases were reported in Iraq.
An Iraqi agriculture ministry official, however, said "Iraq had not
been affected by Rift Valley Fever ... and had taken all
preventative measures to stop the entry of this disease" into the
country. The official described the WHO caution as "completely
baseless", Al-Rafidain newspaper said.
Saudi Arabia has already banned the entry of animals from Iraq, and
border guards and customs officers are on alert, the minister said.
No new cases of the fever have been reported, he added.

[The sentence above "(WHO) cautioned the kingdom 4 days ago to
take precautionary measures against the disease after a number of cases
were reported in Iraq" is ambiguous. It suggests either that WHO
knows about cases in Iraq, or alternatively that the reports of cases
came from an unnamed source. Or it may just be bad reporting.
FAO informed ProMED-mail on 23 Jul 2001 that they had no
knowledge of any cases of RVF in Iraq (see ref. Unconfirmed (02)
above), & as can be seen here, Iraq denies having the disease.
Nevertheless, this report says that "Saudi Arabia has already banned the
entry of animals from Iraq." Draw your own conclusions. - Mod.JW
