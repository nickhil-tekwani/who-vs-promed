This is the 10th rather serious article on BSE epidemiology from Donnelly,
Anderson, et al. and by now there probably aren't too many analytical angles
that have not been taken into account. Still, the modelling is only as good
as the data set and assumptions involved; the former seems to rest on
official reported clinical cases, the latter that economic forces don't
distort reporting too badly. In other words, predictions are for future
official reported clinical cases rather than BSE per se or more to the
point, BSE titre in the food supply from subclinical animals.
The article and detailed graphics are well worth a look. They end up
favoring maternal transmission over horizontal though there remains room for
both, given statistical uncertainties.

Results of new research, to be published on 7 April in Proceedings:
Biological Sciences of the Royal Society, show that the incidence of BSE in
both Great Britain (GB) and Northern Ireland is declining rapidly and is
likely to continue to do so over the next three years.
Dr Neil Ferguson and colleagues from the University of Oxford (including
Professor Roy Anderson F.R.S., a member of the Government's Spongiform
Encephalopathy Advisory Committee), conducted the most detailed statistical
analysis of BSE in Northern Ireland yet performed. The analysis revealed
that the proportion of cattle infected with BSE in Northern Ireland is less
than one-tenth of the proportion infected in
the rest of the UK.
The authors conclude that 'the lower incidence [of BSE] in Northern Ireland,
together with detailed knowledge of the BSE history of individual herds,
allow a "BSE-free" herd certification scheme to be designed'. This could
well impact on next week's crucial vote of the European Union's Scientific
Veterinary Committee over easing the export ban on beef from Northern Ireland.

BSE in Northern Ireland: epidemiological patterns past, present and future.
N. M. Ferguson * , A. C. Ghani, C. A. Donnelly, G. O. Denny, and R. M.
Anderson

By 30 January 1998, there had been 170 259 confirmed cases of BSE in Great
Britain (GB), 1766 confirmed cases in Northern Ireland (NI) (2 January
1998), and 276 confirmed cases in the Republic of Ireland (31 January 1998).
Analysis of the epidemiological patterns in the NI epidemic reveals
significant clustering of cases in herds and counties. The observed
clustering of cases within herds results in lower per capita incidence of
BSE in previously unaffected herds, providing support for the introduction
of a certified herd scheme in NI. By fitting a back calculation model to the
case data, we can estimate the number of animals infected with the
aetiological agent of BSE and project the number of future cases. We predict
that the epidemic will decline rapidly, with approximately 99 cases (95%
confidence interval: 30, 504) occurring in the five year period 1997-2001.
.... The best fit occurs at zero horizontal transmission and 24% maternal
transmission over the last six months of the incubation period effectively
equivalent to approximately 10% maternal transmission in the last year of
the incubation period. The 95% confidence region is large, however, ...
