Canine distemper virus has caused mortality on both captive and free-ranging
large cats, but without more specific information from the Chinese regarding
these cases, all we can do is speculate, which doesn't get us very far.

Concerning the outbreak in tigers at the Shanghai zoo: without more clinical
or laboratory information it is difficult to determine what the cause was.
But if it was a virus there are several feline viruses that could do it -
feline panlekemia virus (FPV) (a parvovirus different from canine
parvovirus) and the cause of "feline distemper" - being the most probable.
But if was a "canine" virus, canine distemper virus (CDV), a morbillivirus,
has been associated with mortalities in both captive large felids in the US
and in free ranging lion populations in the Serengeti.
These are well reported events (Appel et al, J. Vet. Diagnos. Inv.,
6:277-288, 1994; Roelke-Parker et al, Nature, 379:441-445, 1996) documenting
what appears to be an increasingly permissive virus into new host ranges
(although in the case of the feline outbreaks it still appears to be CDV).
FPV and CDV have distinctive clinical and pathological characteristics and
virus or evidence of virus presence can be determined by a number of ways if
post mortem material (formalin-fixed and ideally, ultrafrozen tissues) is
available.
