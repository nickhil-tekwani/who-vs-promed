A man in Massachusetts has been infected with a mosquito-borne virus called eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), health officials confirmed [Sat 10 Aug 2019]. It's the 1st human case reported in the state since 2013.

At least 9 towns are at "critical risk" of exposure to the rare but potentially fatal virus, which can cause brain swelling, according to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.

It's the latest in a series of warnings from state officials about the virus, which has been detected in 227 samples of mosquitoes in 2019, the health department said.

Florida and Delaware issued similar advisories this summer [2018] after the virus was detected in sentinel chickens, though neither state has seen any cases reported in humans.

Any virus transmitted from an insect bite is a big deal, but what is EEE, and what risk does it pose?

The virus isn't common, but it is serious. Every year on average, 7 cases are reported but about 30% of all cases are fatal, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

EEE causes inflammation of the brain, which is often preceded by a high fever, chills, and vomiting. As the illness progresses, patients might experience seizures or a coma that can cause varying degrees of brain damage, the CDC said.

Infections are commonly reported in the summer (mosquitoes thrive in heat and humidity) in states that border the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. But one of 6cases reported to the CDC in 2018 occurred in Michigan.

Just because a state has detected EEE in mosquitoes or chickens doesn't mean the pests will transmit it to people. The virus is named for its prevalence in horses, after all.

Still, it's best to err on the side of caution. The CDC recommends residents of impacted areas go heavy on the repellant, avoid the outdoors after dark, and wear long sleeves and pants if they do venture outside.

On [Sat 10 Aug 2019], the Massachusetts Department of Public Health said lab tests had confirmed a case of EEE in a male over the age of 60 in southern Plymouth County. The case is the 1st in Massachusetts since 2013, according to the body.

A Rochester woman claimed on Facebook that her father was in a coma after being diagnosed with EEE, describing the situation as "shocking and heartbreaking."

A spokesperson for Massachusetts Department of Public Health told Newsweek: the clinical outcome of the man's infection is not a public health matter and therefore not reportable to the body. "His clinical status is now a private medical issue," she said.

Massachusetts Department of Public Health officials responded by raising the risk level for EEE to critical in 9 communities: Carver, Lakeville, Marion, Middleborough, Rochester, and Wareham in Plymouth County and Acushnet, Freetown, and New Bedford in Bristol County.

In a statement on [Sat 10 Aug 2019], Public Health Commissioner Monica Bharel commented: "Today's news is evidence of the significant risk from EEE and we are asking residents to take this risk very seriously. We will continue to monitor this situation and the impacted communities."

Officials have undertaken aerial spraying to control mosquito populations in at-risk areas.

Spread by infected mosquitoes, the condition is also known as sleeping sickness or Triple E. Between 5-10 cases of the rare condition are reported in the US annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These usually occur during the late spring to fall in subtropical areas, such as the Gulf States.

The virus can cause a rare brain infection called encephalitis. Of those who catch the virus, around 30 percent die. Those that survive can suffer mild to severe brain damage. Once infected, it can take between 4-10 days for symptoms of EEE involving encephalitis (EEEV) to emerge. The condition is characterized by headache, chills, vomiting, and a high fever. It can also make a person feel disoriented, as well as trigger seizures or a coma. An EEE infection can be diagnosed with a blood test.

[So far this year (2019), all of the EEE cases posted on ProMED-mail have been in horses. The case above in Massachusetts reminds us that human cases occur as well. As usual, the equine cases have occurred in the eastern states and a Midwestern state in the USA. There is a vaccine available for equine animals and their owners are wise to have them vaccinated. There is no commercially available vaccine for humans, so avoidance of mosquito bites is the best preventive measure.
