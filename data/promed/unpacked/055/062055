[1] National update

Brazil confirmed 545 cases and 164 deaths in the period [Sat 1 Jul 2017 - Tue 20 Feb 2018]. During the same period of last year [2016 - 2017] there were 557 confirmed cases and 178 deaths.

This [Wed 21 Feb 2018] they updated the information sent in by the state secretariats of health concerning the yellow fever situation in the country. In the monitoring period (Sat 1 Jul 2017 - Tue 20 Feb 2018) there were 545 confirmed cases of yellow fever in the country, of which 164 were deaths. In total, there were 1773 reported suspected cases, of which 685 were discarded and 422 remain under investigation during this period. Last year, from July 2016 - 20 Feb 2017, there were 557 confirmed cases and 178 confirmed deaths. The yellow fever reports indicate, since last year, the seasonality of the disease that shows the majority of cases occur in summer. Thus, the period of analysis is considered to be 1 July to 30 June of each year.

Campaign
The Ministry of Health underscores the importance of vaccination of the populations in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo during the campaign against yellow fever. Preliminary data from the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo state that, up to this [Tue 19 Feb 2018], 5.1 million people were vaccinated, 4.7 million with fractionated doses and 422 600 with complete doses. The number corresponds to 25.2 percent of the expected intended public in the Southeast. The recommendation is that these states continue vaccinating until hitting high coverage. The state of Bahia initiated a campaign in 8 municipalities this [Tue 19 Feb 2018].

In order to help the states and municipalities carry out the campaign, the Ministry of Health allocated R54 million [USD 16 610 000] to the states. Of this total, R15.8 million [USD 4 860 000] for Sao Paulo, R30 million [USD 9 230 000] for Rio de Janeiro and R8.2 million [USD 2 520 000] for Bahia. To attend exclusively to the fractionation campaign, the Ministry of Health distributed 19.4 million doses of the yellow fever vaccine to the states of Rio de Janeiro (4.7 million doses) and Sao Paulo (10 million). Also, 15 million syringes were sent to the states, with 5.2 million to Rio de Janeiro, 500 000 to Bahia and 9.3 million to Sao Paulo.

[Interestingly, the Brazilian minister of health, Ricardo Barros, proposed on [Thu 22 Feb 2018] to vaccinate the entire country against yellow fever, after the disease emerged in new areas. The recommendation will now be discussed with international organizations, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) (http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-02/23/c_136992545.htm). It is not clear if there is enough vaccine available to cover the entire population of 207.7 millions in Brazil, even with fractionated doses.

[2] Vaccine administration
Date: Thu 22 Feb 2018
From: Stephen Seligman <sseligman@mail.rockefeller.edu> [edited]


The ProMED-mail post (<Yellow fever - Americas (15): Brazil (RJ) Archive Number: 20180222.5643503>) discusses the widespread dissemination of false information in postings on Facebook expressing questions about the safety of the yellow fever vaccine. As a scientist I am particularly saddened when I learn of individuals who react to wrong information in their decision as to whether they and their family members should take the vaccine. The ProMED posting references an article in the Washington Post that mentions a woman who was thought to have died after receiving the vaccine (https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/brazil-battles-yellow-fever--and-a-dangerous-anti-vaccination-campaign/2018/02/17/fccb9528-0d1e-11e8-998c-96deb18cca19_story.html). Reading the article reveals that the patient had succumbed to bacterial pneumonia. Unfortunately lack of this correct information may have influenced many people particularly in Sao Paulo, Brazil about the safety and advisability of receiving the vaccine.

What is the truth about the dangers of receiving the vaccine versus the risk of developing fatal infection with yellow fever? The fact is that the vaccine makes large areas, especially urban areas in Brazil and other countries in Latin America habitable. With currently used methods, _Aedes aegypti_, the mosquito responsible for the transmission of urban yellow fever, is everywhere in metropolitan areas. Without the vaccine yellow fever could spread like wild fire. It is also true that since 2001 we have become aware of rare instances in which people develop severe, frequently fatal reactions to the vaccine. How frequently? Although there is widespread variation in estimates of this reaction, the best estimates are that it is between 3 and 4 per million (Seligman, S. J. and Casanova, J. L. Yellow fever vaccine: worthy friend or stealthy foe? Expert Rev Vaccines 15, 681-691, doi:10.1080/14760584.2016.1180250 (2016)). We are investigating if these unusual reactions occur in people with genetic immune defects.

Who should receive the vaccine? Obviously if you are in an area where there is no yellow fever or no danger of the development of urban disease, you should not. Currently there are large urban areas in Brazil, particularly Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro where the disease is occurring in nearby rural areas, and you should, unless you are immuno-compromised. In addition, if you live in or are planning to travel to jungle areas where yellow fever persists and is transmitted by other mosquito species, you should either take the vaccine or change your plans. For additional information see the above article.

[Individuals planning to travel to the areas of yellow fever risk should receive the vaccine at least 10 days prior to travel. Dr. Seligman makes the very important point that the benefits of receiving the vaccine far outweigh the very small risk of an adverse vaccine reaction for individuals who live in, or will travel to, areas of risk for transmission of yellow fever virus. One only need to review the recent yellow fever outbreak in Angola to appreciate how swiftly the epidemic progressed in a highly susceptible population, with devastating results.

ProMED-mail thanks Dr Seligman for his insightful comments. - Mod.TY
