Ebola studies detail fatality rate
----------------------------------
A detailed report on a 2007 outbreak in Uganda's Bundibugyo district
involving a novel Ebola strain confirmed that the case-fatality rate
(CFR) was lower than seen with the 2 other strains that cause human
illness, researchers from the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) and Uganda reported yesterday [27 Oct 2010] in
Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID) [Case Fatality Proportion of
Deaths for Infection with Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever, Uganda A. MacNeil et al.
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/upcoming.htm>].

They noted that CFRs in outbreaks of Zaire and Sudan Ebola strains
usually range from 50 percent to 90 percent, but the 2007 outbreak
involving what is now known as the Bundibugyo strain had a 40 percent
CFR (17 of 43 cases). Like the other 2 strains that are human
threats, the Bundibugyo strain was more lethal in people who were
older. Despite the lower CFR, researchers warned that the new strain
is a serious public health concern and showed sustained
person-to-person transmission.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall

[Previous accounts of the outbreak of Ebolavirus hemorrhagic fever at
Bundibugyo in Uganda left the actual number of cases and fatalities
unresolved (see ProMED-mail archived reports below). This new report
establishes that the case-fatality ratio in the outbreak associated
with the Bundibugyo species of Ebolavirus was lower than that
observed previously in outbreaks caused by the Zaire and Sudan
species of Ebolavirus. But the number of confirmed cases in the
outbreak was less than in some previous estimates of the case number. - Mod.CP]
