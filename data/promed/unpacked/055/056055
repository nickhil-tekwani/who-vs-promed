An invasive and exotic tick species native to China, Japan, and Australia has officially been identified in Warren County.

Known as the longhorn tick, the Virginia Department of Agriculture confirmed its presence in the county on Thursday [31 May 2018] when the arachnid was found on locally owned horses. This marks the 2nd confirmed identification of the tick in the Commonwealth [of Virginia]; the 1st came weeks ago in Albemarle County, where one was found on a calf.

The Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Service's Director of Communications, Elaine Lidholm, was quoted as saying that the tick may have been in the area for a while without their knowledge. Little is known about the exotic species or the impact of its presence in the county; Lidholm said it has been associated with tick-borne diseases in Asia but that her department will know more about any potential threats it poses in 2 or 3 months.

[The report mentions that the ticks were found on locally owned horses but does not indicate how many horses or whether they were in different locations in the county. Since this is the 2nd instance of occurrence of the longhorn or bush tick (_Haemaphysalis longicornis_) in Virginia and in a different county, one wonders whether this tick has become established in the state. It was initially reported in the USA for the 1st time in New Jersey in November 2017 and is of serious concern. It is not clear how this tick arrived in New Jersey and in Virginia, or whether these 2 events are connected.

As the report above indicates, this tick is a vector of important pathogens that infect people and domestic animals. One hopes that there will be intensified surveillance in the area in Virginia to find out whether there are additional bush ticks in the area. Ticks can be extremely difficult to control once established in an area. Presumably, the domestic animals in the location where the tick was found have been treated to eliminate ticks of this or any other species.
