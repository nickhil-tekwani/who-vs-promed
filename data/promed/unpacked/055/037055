[In February 2021, Algeria reported one outbreak of peste des petits ruminants, according to the information provided in the official WOAH report: "a farm with 35 goats showing clinical signs suggesting the disease; the animals were confined, the 'zribet' was disinfected and vaccination was carried out around the outbreak. It should be noted that these were newly acquired animals that had not been vaccinated." The event was declared resolved on 1 Mar 2021. See final report no. 2 on 23 May 2022 at https://wahis.woah.org/#/report-info?reportId=54753.

In 2017, FAO and WOAH (previously, OIE) launched the PPR Global Eradication Programme (GEP), framed as a process running to 2030. Mass vaccinations were presented as a central measure to be applied, combined with others. Since the transborder nature of PPR requires actions to be harmonised in all countries in the same region, the affected countries have been grouped into 9 regions, in which the progress towards eradication of PPR was said to be assessed in regional roadmap meetings. Algeria was included, with Morocco, Tunisia and Libya, in the roadmap of the North Africa region. Effective application of the vaccination project has led to a significant reduction of PPR circulation in the said region. The countries bordering North Africa on its south are included in the West Africa Roadmap, where PPR continues its circulation. Transboundary introductions of PPR-infected animals into the North Africa region will continue as long as the situation remains unchanged in the West African region. - Mod.AS/CRD
