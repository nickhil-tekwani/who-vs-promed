Among the many overtones in the "Anthrax, Disposal of Stockpiles-Russia"
story, the survival of anthrax spores should be highlighted. The report
indicates that "Tests of soil samples from 6 of 11 vast burial pits show
that, although the anthrax was soaked in bleach at least twice, once inside
the 66-gallon containers and again after it was dumped into the sandy pits
and buried for a decade under 3-to-5 feet of sand, some of the spores are
still alive -and potentially deadly." Although details of the treatment
with bleach are missing, the finding of viable anthrax seems to relate to
the serious limitations of liquid disinfectants summarized by the US
General Accounting Office in 1990 (Federal Document GAO/RCED-90-139,
Washington, DC).
Bleach (sodium hypochlorite) has little effect on bacterial spores at
certain pH (Appl. Environm. Microbiol. 1996, 62(2): 545-551) and was the
disinfecting agent most sensitive to the presence of protein (J. AOAC Int.
1997, 80(6):1198-1207). Furthermore, bleach kills less spores when these
are deposited (even for a short period) on surfaces than when they are free
in suspension (Am. J. Infection Control 1996, 24:364-371). The problems of
sodium hypochlorite are not limited to spores, since some vegetative
bacteria are quite resistant to this chemical (Am. J. Infection Control
1997, 25:335-339). In spite of this kind of data, decontamination with
bleach seems to remain an unquestioned ritual in training manuals for
bacteriological warfare and control of bioterrorism.
Unfortunately, alternative disinfectants have their own limitations as
documented by abundant laboratory data and indirectly, suggested by the
high incidence of hospital infections. The current situation regarding
decontamination of bacteriological warfare stockpiles in particular and
infection control in general could be improved. It would be desirable to
reexamine our scientific assumptions in the light of new threats and new
data before the limitations of current decontamination practices became [an
issue in a major city. The story of Ozrozhdeniye Island about finding
anthrax still infectious after double decontamination suggests that not
only spores have been buried in the sand for a decade, but perhaps, that
our heads have been buried too.

The recent discovery of abandoned stocks of potentially viable anthrax
spores in parts of the FSU (Former Soviet Union) may offer a real world
test of some new decontamination technologies.
In today's issue of Science (June 11, 1999), an article by Joseph Alper
describes some new emulsions that may be effective against bacterial spores
("From the Bioweapons Trenches, New Tools for Battling Microbes").
"To Baker's initial surprise, the emulsions proved effective against
bacterial spores (a form of suspended animation in which the bacteria
produce a hard protective coat) which tend to resist all but the harshest
chemicals. "It appears that the oil acts as a nutrient that tricks the
spores to start producing cell membrane, a process that the emulsions
disrupt quite easily," said Baker."
Baker is at the Univ. of Michigan. His DARPA-supported research is
described at the DARPA web site <http://www.darpa.mil/DSO/rd/UPC/0011.html>.

England and Scotland experimented with anthrax during World War I. They
dumped some spores on an island north of Scotland which is still
uninhabited now, some 80 years later. Spores of anthrax survive virtually
indefinitely in soil. They do have problems in Uzbekistan. It is almost
like dealing with some nuclear waste.
