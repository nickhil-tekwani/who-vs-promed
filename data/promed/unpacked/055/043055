ref: Jones G, Lefevre S, Donguy MP, et al. Outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ O26 paediatric haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) cases associated with the consumption of soft raw cow's milk cheeses, France, March to May 2019
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Outbreak detection
------------------
From 25 Mar to 27 Apr 2019, 19 suspected Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ (STEC) [also called enterohemorrhagic _E coli or EHEC. - Mod.LL) associated pediatric haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) cases were notified by French hospital paediatric departments to Sante publique France, compared with 5-10 cases during the same period in previous years [1]. 13 cases were confirmed as serogroup O26, with whole genome sequencing (WGS) underway for strain comparison. Initial epidemiological investigations using a trawling questionnaire identified the consumption of raw cow's milk soft cheeses (Saint-Felicien and Saint-Marcellin) as the common link for 8 of these 13 cases. Trace-back investigations using supermarket loyalty cards identified a common producer (producer A) of these cheeses for 3 cases and on the basis of this information a recall was initiated by French health authorities on 27 Apr 2019 [2].

Outbreak investigations
-----------------------
As of 27 May 2019, investigations identified 16 outbreak cases including 14 pediatric HUS cases and 2 cases with uncomplicated diarrhoea (one child and one adult). Investigations are ongoing for one suspected case. The 16 outbreak cases reside in 6 administrative regions in France. All pediatric cases are under 5 years of age; the median age is 22 months (overall age range: 6 months-63 years). 8 cases are female. Date of symptom onset was between 31 Mar 2019 (week 13) and 29 Apr 2019 (week 18) (Figure 1 [for Figures, see source URL above. - Mod.LL]). All HUS cases were hospitalized. 13 cases received blood and/or platelet transfusion and 7 underwent hemodialysis. 6 cases had neurological complications, all of them received transfusions and 3 also had hemodialysis.

The families of all 16 outbreak cases and the suspected case were interviewed about their at-risk exposures during the 10 days before symptom onset. Families of 16 cases (15 outbreak cases and one suspected case) reported the consumption of Saint-Felicien or Saint-Marcellin raw cow's milk cheeses by either the case (n = 12) or household members (n = 4). One outbreak case did not report consumption of these cheeses. For the 16 cases with reported consumption of these cheeses, trace-back investigations using loyalty cards and supply data from the different shops where the caretakers reported purchasing the cheeses identified a link with producer A for 13 (all outbreak cases).

Producer A manufactured only Saint-Felicien and Saint-Marcellin cheeses. To date, no positive EHEC O26 cheese or milk samples have been identified. Investigations, including sampling of the cheeses and trace-back of the milk supply chains, are ongoing.

Four outbreak cases had not consumed the cheeses themselves but a household member had. This suggests the affected child may have been infected via cross contamination (knives, cutting board, hands, etc.). None of the household members reported symptoms of illness, indicating that the cases were unlikely to have been infected by person-to-person transmission. Investigations are ongoing in an attempt to further document the exposures of these cases (consumption of cheeses or other food items cut by the knives or on the same cutting board as the suspected cheeses). Only one in 16 outbreak cases reported a family member with self-limiting diarrhoea (no stool analysis).

Microbiological investigations
------------------------------
In France, STEC surveillance is based on surveillance of HUS in children  aged less than 15 years by a network of voluntary paediatric and pediatric nephrology departments [1]. All medical laboratories in France can send stool samples to the associated laboratory of the National Reference Centre (NRC-RD) for _E. coli_ (Microbiology department, Robert Debre Hospital, Paris) for EHEC screening, confirmation and determination of serogroup and virulence factors.

Since April 2017, isolated strains are sent to the French National Reference Centre for _E. coli_, shigella, and salmonella (NRC-ESS) at Institut Pasteur (Paris, France) for whole genome sequencing (WGS) and determination of cluster affiliation. WGS is performed as previously described [3]. Stool samples for all suspected cases were sent to the NRC-RD and isolated strains underwent WGS at the NRC-ESS.

The determination of serotype (O and H antigens) [4], virulence genes (stx, eae, ehxA, saa, aggR, and subA genes), acquired resistance genes and MLST [multilocus sequence typing] are performed using tools available at the Center for Genomic Epidemiology (https://cge.cbs.dtu.dk/services/). Phylogenetic analysis is performed by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) analysis integrated into Enterobase [5].

SNP analysis revealed that 16 human isolates of _E. coli_ serotype O26:H11 harboring stx2a and eae-beta virulence genes, but not the ehxA gene, clustered tightly together (Figure 2). Clustered isolates displayed MLST type ST21 and an identical type '75047' by hierarchical clustering of cgMLST data differing by less than 10 alleles (HC10).

Of all the human isolates received at the NRC-ESS from 2016 to April 2019, only one (201808628) belonged to the same cgMLST HC10|75047 cluster. SNP analysis revealed that this isolate was a close ancestor to the current 2019 outbreak isolates. The strain was isolated in September 2018, from case of paediatric HUS residing in the neighboring administrative department from producer A. Investigations did not identify a possible link with current outbreak cases. All studied genomes were deposited into EnteroBase and raw reads of 3 representative outbreak isolates (201902616, 201902803, and 201902835) were also deposited to the European Nt Archive (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena), under study accession number PRJEB32463.

Control measures
----------------
Based on the initial results of epidemiological and trace-back investigations (cgMLST results and microbiological analysis of the cheeses were pending), the complete production of the incriminated producer was recalled on 27 Apr 2019 [2]. The reasons for recalling at a very early stage were: (i) the high proportion of interviewed cases reporting consumption of these cheeses (8/13 EHEC O26 cases initially under investigation), (ii) the rapid identification of a common producer of the cheeses consumed by 3 cases; and (iii) the severity of the infections in the cases. All cheeses from the producer A made from 1 Feb to 27 Apr 2019 were recalled from supermarkets and retail shops. Investigations are ongoing at producer A facilities and microbiological analyses of milk and cheese samples are ongoing.

On a national level, a press release regarding the recall was issued on 27 Apr 2019 [2] to inform consumers about the list of brands under which these cheeses were sold. People who still had cheese from this producer in their home were advised to not consume it and return it to the place of purchase. On 2 May 2019, a 2nd press release was issued with an updated list of potential brands under which the suspected products were sold [6]. Recommendations about the risk of consumption of raw milk cheeses in children, especially those aged less than 5 years, were diffused in the media (press release, newspapers).

Information was relayed to international health authorities through a message on the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) Epidemic Intelligence Information System for Food- and Waterborne Diseases and Zoonoses (EPIS-FWD) published on 30 Apr 2019. Representative sequences were made available on 7 May 2019. As at 27 May 2017, none of the 13 responding countries have reported cases linked to this outbreak.

Trace-forward investigations identified the export of the recalled cheeses to countries inside and outside the European Union. The information was shared via a Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF: notification 2019.1615) message and an International Food Safety Authorities Network (Infosan) message on 30 Apr 2017 [7]. As at 27 May 2019, 33 countries had received distributions of the incriminated products.

Conclusion
----------
This outbreak of pediatric HUS in France was linked to the consumption of Saint-Marcellin and Saint-Felicien cheeses. While paediatric HUS cases are likely to be notified to public health authorities through the national surveillance system, EHEC infections presenting as non-complicated diarrhoea may not be identified (no stool analysis, samples not sent to the NRC-RD) and the number of cases linked to this outbreak may be underestimated. The outbreak is notable for the young age of cases and the severity of the illness. These factors contributed to the decision to recall the products early in the investigation, despite pending results of the cgMLST and case/product investigations. Timely notification of cases by the French pediatric HUS surveillance system enabled rapid epidemiological investigations during which crucial information to guide control measures was obtained. Investigations are ongoing and it is possible that additional cases may be notified, as information about the product recall may not have reached some consumers in France or in countries where the cheeses were imported.

In the last 10 years, 3 HUS outbreaks linked to the consumption of raw milk cheeses have occurred in France, including 2 in 2018 that were linked to the consumption of Reblochon cheese [8-10]. In the current outbreak, several families reported consumption of the suspected cheeses by family members, but not by the ill child. This suggests that the risk of cross contamination from food vehicles consumed by family members of young children should also be considered during investigations.

These outbreaks highlight the risk of consuming raw milk cheese, particularly for young children. Increasing public awareness of the risk is therefore an important preventive measure. An interdisciplinary group of public health and food safety authorities is currently working on development of communication strategies in France to improve consumer awareness regarding these risks.

[Unpasteurized dairy products remain a potential risk for a variety of pathogens, including enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC), either the prototypic serotype or one of the other serotypes; in this case, O26. In analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups of EHEC, it has been found that they belong to their own lineages and have unique profiles of virulence traits different from the prototypic O157 strain (1). The serogroups appearing to be most prominent are O26, O111, O128, and O103 (2), the O26 serotype being the implicated strain in this outbreak.

From the past reports and this follow-up, many of the cases had HUS. For so many of the reported cases to be associated with HUS is very unusual; I would suspect that more cases are known, or the particular strain is a hyperproducer of Shiga toxin, or the specific toxin is more potent.

The following was extracted from Lutwick LI. Enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ infections. In: Confronting emerging zoonoses: the One Health paradigm. Yamada A, Kahn LH, Kaplan B, et al. (editors). Tokyo, Japan: Springer; 2014:77-112:

"Risk factors for the subsequent development of HUS after EHEC include children less than 10 years of age, elevated white blood cell counts, persistent low platelet counts without reversal and the use of either antimicrobial agents or antimotility agents during the diarrhea stage before or after bloody diarrhea develops. Since fever is generally not part of the presentation but significant abdominal pain is, patients with diarrhea, significant abdominal pain and no fever should be considered to have EHEC infection, and antimicrobial or antimotility agents should be avoided. Additionally, certain strains -- for example, the so-called clade 8 and the chimeric organism _E. coli_ O104:H4 -- can be associated with a higher risk of HUS.

"HUS itself is a thrombotic illness primarily caused by the effects of the EHEC-produced Shiga toxin acting on the vascular endometrium of organs where the toxin's receptors are expressed, particularly the kidney and brain. The syndrome consists of the combination of prominent low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia), intravascular red blood cell destruction (hemolysis), and diminished kidney function that can require hemodialysis. Neurological involvement occurs mostly in those who develop renal failure and the central nervous system involvement portends much higher mortality. Indeed, most of the acute mortality relates to neurological disease. Most patients will recover, but some, perhaps 10%, remain with renal failure and require chronic hemodialysis."
