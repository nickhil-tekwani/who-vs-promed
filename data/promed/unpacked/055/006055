The Ministry of Health and Sanitation of Sierra Leone confirmed today that
the current outbreak of cholera affecting the country is caused by _Vibrio
cholerae_ O1 El Tor, which was identified and confirmed by the Pasteur
Institute in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire.
As of 16 Sep 1998, 1770 cases and 55 deaths were registered. Although
some cases of _V. cholerae_ non-O1 were also identified, tests for
isolation of _V. cholerae_ O139 were negative.
The Ministry of Health and Sanitation, with support from several agencies,
took measures to quickly identify the causative agent and formulate
strategies to control the outbreak. Surveillance activities, diarrhoea
treatment centres and health education on personal and environmental
hygiene have already contributed to a reduction in the number of deaths.
