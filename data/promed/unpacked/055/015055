Another child has died amid a deadly virus outbreak at a New Jersey rehabilitation, bringing the total number of deaths to 9, officials said [Sun 28 Oct 2018].

The state's Department of Health said the victim was a "medically fragile" child who had a confirmed case of adenovirus. The unidentified child died Saturday evening [27 Oct 2018] at the Wanaque Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation in Haskell, the department said.

There have been 25 cases associated with the outbreak. "This is a tragic situation, and our thoughts are with the families who are grieving right now," Health Commissioner Dr Shereef Elnahal said in a statement. "We are working every day to ensure all infection control protocols are continuously followed and closely monitoring the situation at the facility."

Adenoviruses are a family of viruses that account for about 5 to 10 percent of fevers in young children, but most patients recover. The infections can affect the tissue linings of the respiratory tract, eyes, intestines, urinary tract and nervous system, causing illnesses ranging from a cold to bronchitis to pneumonia to pink eye.

The children at Wanaque appear to have been more susceptible to serious infections due to their other medical conditions.

Children at the center are severely disabled, with some living in comas, and for many, it is their permanent home, the Bergen Record reports.

Many will never walk or talk, and some have spent virtually their whole lives there, according to the paper.

[Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are non-enveloped, linear double-stranded DNA viruses encapsidated within a protein shell and have been categorized into 6 species (A-F) that contain 51 immunologically distinct serotypes (Fields virology. 5th ed. Philadelphia (PA): Lippincott-Raven; 2007. p. 2395-436). HAdVs most commonly cause acute respiratory disease; however, depending on the infecting HAdV serotype and tropism resulting from differential host receptor use, the wide variety of symptoms can include pneumonia, febrile upper respiratory illness, conjunctivitis, cystitis, and gastroenteritis (Principles and practice of infectious diseases. 5th ed. Vol 2. Philadelphia (PA): Churchill Livingstone; 2005. p. 1835-41).

The severity of disease appears dependent on the immunocompetence and cardiopulmonary health of the host, and the spectrum of disease can range from subclinical to severe respiratory distress and death. Immunocompromised patients (such as bone marrow transplant recipients) are particularly susceptible to HAdV infection, resulting in severe illness and deaths, whereas illness in immunocompetent patients generally resolves without major complication.

The outbreak report above involves young children that are in a healthcare facility and immunocompromised on account of underlying co- morbid conditions. Adenovirus associated morbidity and mortality in this setting would require intensive infection control measures.

In immunocompromised patients, several drugs, such as cidofovir, ribavirin, ganciclovir, and vidarabine, have been used to treat adenovirus infections. Most of these agents are virostatic, may induce drug resistance, and have significant risks of toxicities, as well as risks to healthcare staff [e.g., aerosolized ribavirin - Mod.ML]. - Mod.UBA
