Preliminary investigations into _E. coli_ in Surrey have revealed one case of the strain has been confirmed in the county while other _E. coli_ cases in children in the area have been identified as being potentially linked. Public Health England (PHE) said it is working closely with environmental health officers and public health teams from Surrey County Council to investigate the case.

A young woman from Guildford has been left in a critical condition in hospital after she contracted a rare strain of _E. coli_. The woman and her sister both fell ill within hours of each other on Sat 16 Sep 2017. The eldest of the sisters, aged 22, recovered after a few days of having symptoms such as diarrhea and abdominal pain. However, the health of the younger sister, 19, quickly deteriorated and she suffered kidney failure, then developed a blood disease called hemolytic-uremic syndrome [HUS]. This led to several of her organs failing, including her heart. The woman has been in critical condition at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London since 27 Sep 2017.

A PHE spokesman said letters have been sent to a local primary school, warning parents if children show symptoms, then further advice should be sought from a doctor. "To date, one case of this strain has been confirmed and they are receiving treatment in hospital," they said.

"There have been are other _E. coli_ cases in children in neighboring postcode areas which have been identified as being potentially linked -- all these cases are now recovering well at home. PHE has been working to establish the source of all these cases and see if there is a connection with the confirmed case of _E. coli_ O55. Currently, no source or definite link has been confirmed, and the matter remains under investigation," the spokesman added.

_E. coli_ O55, O157 [and certain other strain] infections can cause a range of symptoms including nausea, abdominal cramps, lethargy and diarrhoea and vomiting. The PHE spokesman added: "We are also doing all we can to ensure the infection does not spread further through control and prevention measures. Letters have been sent to a local primary school to advise if any children show symptoms, such as diarrhoea, then further advice should be sought from their local GP and the Health Protection Team at PHE. GPs in the area have been advised to look out for symptoms and advise us of any concerns."

[A smoldering outbreak of _E. coli_ O55 occurred in England, geographically close to the current case or cases in 2014-2015. The discussion from the manuscript "Recurrent seasonal outbreak of an emerging serotype of Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ (STEC [or enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ - EHEC] O55:H7 Stx2a) in the south west of England" from Eurosurveillance http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=22872 is reproduced below (citations can be found at the original URL). It is not clear whether the current strain is genetically related to the 2014-2015 outbreak of 31 cases.

"In addition to being the 1st recorded outbreak of [EHEC] O55:H7 in England, striking features of the outbreak include its seasonality, the high proportion of cases developing HUS (13/31) compared with the background rate for [EHEC] O157 (5 percent) (2) and the geographical component linking all (co)primary cases to Bournemouth and Weymouth in Dorset. Evidence of human-to-human transmission of [EHEC] O55:H7 within the nursery cluster was shown by the propagated epidemic curve and WGS [whole genome sequencing] with cases in this cluster forming a largely homogenous monophyletic sub-cluster among isolates in the outbreak as a whole. Overall, isolates showed more diversity than would be expected in a [EHEC] point-source outbreak (25). The genetic similarity between isolates taken from Dorset cases and the 2013-14 Irish cases suggests infection by the same or closely related populations of [EHEC] O55:H7 and may represent a common zoonotic reservoir. Enhanced surveillance suggested infection to be less widespread than feared in the Dorset population. Contacts were tested more widely than normal (for a [EHEC] outbreak) using culture/PCR and/or serology ensuring the identification of asymptomatic household contacts. To date there have been no further cases in this WGS cluster, although other _E. coli_ O55 cases have occurred elsewhere in England. Despite the use of an iterative re-interviewing process, no common exposures linked all primary cases and food, water and environmental testing was negative for contamination by [EHEC] O55:H7. There was little evidence to support the hypotheses of contaminated food items or drinking water or a specific recreational/environmental exposure. Given this, and the geographical clustering around 2 areas of Dorset, the 3rd hypothesis of a local endemic zoonotic infection acquired in humans from infected pets and/or directly from the environment seems the most likely cause of this outbreak.

Due to the protracted nature of the outbreak, problems in recall may have hampered the effectiveness of the iterative re-interviewing approach, given the time lag between cases. It is possible that using the onset date of the associated primary case as the starting point for a 14-day exposure history-taking among asymptomatic cases missed important exposures if their infection had been acquired earlier. However, all of the asymptomatic cases were picked up through screening of contacts or nursery screening, all those identified by serology were epidemiologically linked to a WGS-confirmed case and many asymptomatic cases were adult household contacts of children, so it is likely that the majority of them were secondary cases whose infection was acquired by human-to-human transmission. Even if putative exposures had been identified, having only 10 (co)primary cases would have made hypothesis testing via an analytical study challenging.

The environmental hypothesis appears most likely although there were no positive environmental samples (including boot socks, animal feces, bird sanctuaries, or water) to confirm it. The delay between symptom onset and environmental sampling could have reduced the chance of a positive finding and sensitivity of direct culturing from feces can be poor if [EHEC] numbers are low. Similar delays may also have reduced the likelihood of finding a positive sample among pets. There is currently no evidence of [EHEC] O55:H7 in the cattle population in the UK but cattle and other ruminants are a known source of [EHEC] (26). Delays between infection and sampling, particularly among screened contacts, may also have led to cases being missed early in the outbreak. However, after the 1st few cases we tested contacts more widely than normal for a [EHEC] outbreak and detected a number of asymptomatic household contacts using serology, so we are confident that any symptomatic contacts would also have been identified microbiologically, either via culture or serology. Furthermore, it is possible that asymptomatic or mild diarrheal illness may have been underestimated as most case ascertainment of [EHEC] O55:H7 was due to presentation with HUS, with non-HUS-associated infections being missed apart from the periods of enhanced surveillance. The absence of additional cases arising from the testing of all diarrheal specimens from local and regional laboratories for [EHEC] O55:H7 over a 12-week period is evidence against this, however, this extended testing regime occurred in the autumn, when fewer or no cases were expected.

[EHEC] O55:H7 is phylogenetically closely related to [EHEC] O157:H7 (12,25) and assumed therefore to have similar exposure risks and transmission routes. The observed seasonality (July-October 2014; May-September 2015) is similar to that seen for [EHEC] O157 (April-September) in England and Wales (27). This may reflect greater time spent outdoors during warmer months of the year, increasing exposure to the environment. Migratory birds as a transmission source common to Dorset and ROI could also help explain both the seasonality and genetic similarity between Irish and Dorset cases and birds (rooks) have previously been linked to [EHEC] O157 infection in children (28). The analysis focused on bird migration between ROI and Dorset but it is also possible that [EHEC] O55:H7 was introduced by migratory bird species, with a shared winter feeding ground, that use the coast of ROI and the coast of England as destinations for summer feeding. In 5 of the 6 primary cases linked to Bournemouth, symptom onset occurred in a period of 1-9 days following flooding events, suggesting these events could have played a role. 3 of these 4 cases reported visiting the public gardens or beach in Bournemouth and their illness could plausibly be explained by exposure to land recently flooded by stream water contaminated by animal feces or to the sea into which the stream discharges. The [EHEC] O55:H7 positive fecal specimens from 2 cats provided evidence that domestic pets may act as a vector for the pathogen and may support a hypothesis of an environmental or local zoonotic reservoir. This is consistent with reports of [EHEC] O145 serotypes in sporadic HUS in children which were also isolated from their asymptomatic pet cats (29,30). There were no common factors found for foods consumed by the pets, but it was not possible from the information collected to determine the extent to which cases' pets interacted with the rural environment, wildlife or rodents. It is possible that there are several vectors responsible for the environmental spread and cases could also have acquired [EHEC] O55:H7 directly from the environment.

This outbreak provides a number of learning points. Proactive media engagement was important and helped to ensure risk communication throughout the outbreak was effective and that the timing and control of information could be maintained by PHE. The evidence from WGS of isolates forming a closely related cluster was an important driver behind the extensive investigations undertaken. As WGS is used increasingly in England for outbreak investigation and detection, it is likely to be a driver in the future for investigating small outbreaks of illness that are not clearly linked epidemiologically (31,32)."
