99/073 Survey on _Ralstonia solanacearum_ and _Clavibacter
michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ in Latvia [edited]
A survey for _Ralstonia solanacearum_ and _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp.
_sepedonicus_ (both EPPO A2 quarantine pests) in seed potatoes was conducted
in 1998 in Latvia. Sixty-two samples were collected from 540 ha and tested
by IF for _R.solanacearum_ and by ELISA and IF for _C. michiganensis_ subsp.
_sepedonicus_ (according to the Council Directives 98/57/EC and
93/85/EEC).
_R. solanacearum_ was not found in the tested samples but _C.
michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ was detected in 14 samples.
The total area infested by ring rot was 72.3 ha. Phytosanitary
measures to prevent any further spread and to eradicate the
pathogen have been taken following the requirements of Council
Directive 93/85/EEC. According to the EPPO Secretariat, this is
the first report of _C. michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ in Latvia.

[_C. michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ is listed as present in a number of
eastern European countries. A 1996 report on distribution of the pathogen
in Europe concluded that there was insufficient evidence for presence of
the disease in Latvia. The EPPO report now confirms the presence of the
pathogen, hence this report - Mod. DH]
