The state Secretariat of Health of Rio de Janeiro today [30 Apr 2008]
confirmed that there were 10 more deaths this week due to dengue,
raising the [total] number of deaths from this disease since 1 Jan
[2008] to 103. Up to the present, 121 586 [dengue] cases have been
registered, 10 879 more than in the past week. Of the deaths, 62 were
in the capital city. Although the number of registered cases is not
increasing with the same intensity as in the beginning of the
epidemic, there are 106 dengue-suspected deaths [still] under
investigation. This year [2008], Rio has registered the most deadly
dengue epidemic in its history -- in 2002 there were 92 [dengue]
deaths.

In the capital [city], 66 942 [dengue] cases were recorded. Yesterday
[29 Apr 2008], the municipal secretary of health, Jacob Kligerman,
said there is "a clear decrease of dengue in the city " and that the
municipality is already studying the actions for 2009. The State
still has not demobilized the mechanism that has been mounted to
combat the epidemic -- stations for rehydration and hiring extra
doctors, many from other states.

According to the State Secretariat of Health, although experts say
that dengue should diminish considerably in the month of May,
secretary Sergio Cortes says that he believes it to be too early for
demobilization [of the dengue control and treatment effort]. This
week, more than 1.5 million booklets have started to be distributed
in bus and rail terminals in the metropolitan region of Rio.
According to Cortes, the educational action should be continued to
prevent another epidemic next year [2009].

[Although many new cases are still appearing, one hopes that the peak
of the dengue epidemic has been reached and, along with cooler
weather, there will be a sharp decline in the number of infected
individuals in Rio state and city.

During April 2008, 2 children died of dengue fever in Sukoharjo
District, Central Java province.

In the 1st quarter of 2008, there were a total of 160 dengue fever
cases and 7 residents died of the disease in the district, Agus
Prihatmo of the Sukohardjo health service said on Thursday [1 May
2008].

Most of the victims were children and they lost their lives because
they had been admitted to hospital in very critical condition, he
said, [and added that there is a] lack of awareness in the community
on the eradication of mosquito-nesting [breeding] grounds, making the
areas prone to dengue fever caused by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito bites
[transmitting dengue virus. - Mod.TY]

[The 2008 dengue outbreak in Central Java continues (see ProMED-mail
no. 20080324.1110). Interestingly, and unfortunately, there is also a
chikungunya outbreak going on in the same general area in central
Java. Dengue and chikungunya viruses are transmitted by the same
vector mosquito species.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur A-Lan Banks also provided this report.

The Centre for Health Protection has confirmed the year's [2008] 11th
dengue fever case involving a 30-year-old man who fell sick after
visiting the Maldives.

He travelled to the Maldives 5-13 Apr [2008] and developed a fever,
sore throat, runny nose, and rash on 18 Apr [2008]. He was admitted
to Princess Margaret Hospital 4 days later and was discharged on 27
Apr [2008].

Last year [2007], 58 [dengue] cases were reported [in Hong Kong] and
all of them were classified as imported cases.

[The Maldives suffered a severe chikungunya epidemic in 2006 (see
ProMED-mail archive no. 20061224.3598). Chikungunya and dengue
viruses are transmitted by the same _Aedes_ mosquitoes. The report
above indicates that significant _Aedes_ populations are still
present in the Maldives, and are now transmitting dengue virus. It
would be of interest to know what mosquito vector control measures
are being taken to reduce _Aedes aegypti_ or _Aedes albopictus_
populations on the affected islands.
