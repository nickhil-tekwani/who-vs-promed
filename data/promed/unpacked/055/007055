'Mutant' mushrooms trigger deadly brain disease
-------------------------------------------------
A bumper crop of "angel's wing" mushrooms may be partially responsible for
the outbreak of a deadly brain disease among patients with kidney ailments,
experts have pointed out.
Extraordinarily large angel's wing mushrooms have been found across the
country, giving rise to speculation that the environment in which such
mushrooms grow has drastically changed, apparently causing them to contain
toxic components.
A man in his 50s living in northern Niigata Prefecture, who had been
undergoing artificial dialysis for more than 20 years suffered a brain
disease after drinking miso soup containing an angel's wing on the morning
of 6 Oct 2004. Fortunately, he fully recovered after receiving an
intravenous drip infusion.
"Until last year, I had eaten that type of mushroom, but it didn't cause me
any problem. Maybe I ate more this year than before," he said.
Angel's wing mushrooms, referred to scientifically as _Pleurocybella
porrigens_, grow in the stumps of pine and cedar trees.
This year, some of them had grown big enough to harvest by early September,
a week or 2 earlier than usual, according to Noriyuki Matsumoto, a
researcher at the Niigata Prefectural Government's forestry research
institute. Furthermore, this year's crop was nearly twice the amount of
last year's. Angel's wing mushrooms usually grow to 4 to 5 centimeters, but
this year many of them have grown as large as the palm of an adult's hand.
"It was hotter this summer than usual, and it rained a lot in August partly
because a typhoon directly hit the archipelago. The environment in which
the mushrooms grow was irregular," Matsumoto said.
Kanazawa University Prof. Tomihisa Ota specializing in mushrooms suspects
that numerous kidney disease patients suffered brain diseases either
because they ate excessive volumes of angel's wings or the toxic components
in the mushrooms increased.
"A patient in Ishikawa Prefecture appears to have eaten that type of
mushroom almost every day. Patients ate more angel's wing mushrooms than
usual because of the bumper crop, or toxic components in the mushrooms may
have increased. I guess either of those factors has overly affected the
patients' health," he said.
By Thursday, 46 cases of such brain illnesses had been reported in 8
prefectures from Tohoku to Hokuriku regions in eastern Honshu, and 14
patients died, according to the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry.
Most of the patients had serious kidney ailments, and an overwhelming
majority suffered the brain illness after eating such mushrooms.

[Some sources report this as the oyster mushroom, which is apparently a
popular autumn delicacy in the northern area of Japan. Mushroom specialists
report an abundance of this mushroom in the mountains. These same
specialists suspect it may be a bacterium or virus on the mushroom, or
perhaps the environment that has produced such abundance has also caused a
toxin in the soil that the fungi have concentrated.
According to an article (sent by Reiko Saito of the Division of Public
Health and Department of Infectious Disease Control and International
Medicine at Niigata University, Graduate School of Medical and Dental
Sciences in Niigata City of the Niigata Prefecture, of Japan) the Japanese
government changed the legislation on infectious diseases. All encephalitis
cases are to be reported to the local governments within 7 days of patient
hospitalization. This has been enforced since November 2003. Thus the
string of case findings of unknown encephalitis might be influenced by last
year's change in the law. - Mod.TG]
