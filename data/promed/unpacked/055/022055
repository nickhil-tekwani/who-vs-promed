[1] Democratic Republic of Congo (North Kivu): Ebola vaccination

Within days of confirming a new Ebola case in North Kivu province, medical teams in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) today [25 Aug 2022] launched an Ebola vaccination campaign in Beni, the area where the fatal case was reported. On Twitter, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it provided 200 vaccine doses and is supporting the country's ring vaccination campaign.

In a separate statement, the WHO shared more details about the new case, which officials have said has been genetically linked to the virus that circulated during the region's large outbreak in 2018-2020. It said the 46-year-old woman who died from her infection on 15 Aug 2022 had underlying health conditions and had been hospitalized for 23 days. Samples were obtained just after she died, and her body was buried before the Ebola results were known. So far, it's not known if the woman had been vaccinated against Ebola.

So far, investigators have identified 134 hospital contacts and 9 family contacts.

The WHO said the risk to the DRC is high, with the threat to the region and the world moderate and low, respectively. It added that the Beni area is affected by insecurity, with frequent protests against security measures, adding challenges to the outbreak response.

The agency also said the DRC is juggling responses to other diseases, such as cholera, measles, polio, yellow fever, and monkeypox, putting further pressure on the healthcare system and resources.

[2] Democratic Republic of Congo: multiple disease outbreaks

More than 8900 people have died following multiple disease outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) this year [2022]. These deaths do not include those from the coronavirus (COVID-19).

The European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO) provided the figures amid the DRC'S high infectious disease burden and its susceptibility to recurrent epidemics that require emergency support and create additional humanitarian needs.

On Monday [22 Aug 2022], authorities declared the resurgence of Ebolavirus disease (EVD) in Beni in North Kivu province. The patient has died. Genome sequencing has confirmed that the case represents a flareup of the previous EVD outbreak in the area in 2018-2020. In total, there have been 5 EVD cases, all which have resulted in death, in the DRC so far in 2022.

Other diseases are wreaking havoc, with figures representing fatalities from 1 Jan to August this year [2022]. The most fatal is malaria, with over 7000 deaths from more than 11.7 million cases. Measles has left 1183 people dead from 89 537 suspected cases. No fewer than 520 people have died from over 1.15 million suspected cases of typhoid fever. ECHO also reported 122 deaths from cholera, 109 fatalities from monkeypox, 15 deaths from yellow fever and 9 fatalities from bubonic plague.

DRC has recorded 1396 deaths from 92 588 COVID-19 cases since 2020.

Rebel groups terrorizing mostly the eastern parts of the country render intervention by health workers risky.

[3] Uganda (Kisoro): Ebola screening equipment requested

Health authorities in Kisoro have expressed fear of an Ebola outbreak due to lack of equipment to screen hundreds of Congolese refugees that cross into the district daily through the Bunagana border and porous points to escape insecurity back home. This comes after the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) registered a new Ebola case in the country's North Kivu province on Monday [22 Aug 2022].

Statistics from the Office of the Prime Minister indicate that about 300 Congolese refugees cross into Uganda through Bunagana and illegal points on a daily basis.

"We are living at the mercy of God because we do not have any equipment to screen the hundreds of Congolese refugees that cross into our district because the one we had got spoilt and has never been repaired. We appeal to the Ministry of Health and other partners to help us because there is a possible Ebola outbreak in our district," Ms Annet Dusabe, the assistant district health officer in charge of maternal and child health, said this week.

Ms Dusabe said although they have provided hand-washing facilities at all 7 health centres at the border, there is still a risk.

Mr Daniel Kisaamo, the commandant at the Nyakabande refugee transit camp in Kisoro, said they have always provided hand-washing facilities and isolated refugees that presented high temperatures to control the spread of COVID-19, adding that they will do the same for Ebola.

"Our staff are equipped with protective gear, besides providing hand-washing facilities for all the Congolese refugee arrivals at the transit camp. We shall continue to do the same to control possible Ebola outbreak," Mr Kisaamo said.

Dr Allan Muruta, the commissioner in charge of epidemics at the Ministry of Health, earlier said they were sensitising health workers and residents about the identification of Ebola symptoms and prevention of the disease.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) recently started a 5-day training in Kampala to increase the capacity of health workers in 5 countries, Uganda inclusive, to respond to infectious diseases such as Ebola.

In May [2022], the Minister of State for Relief, Disaster Preparedness and Refugees, Ms Esther Anyakun, issued a 7-day ultimatum to all Congolese refugees that were renting houses in the Bunagana border and other border sub-counties in the district to voluntarily relocate to Nyakabande camp or return to their country. However, the directive was reversed following fresh fighting between the M23 rebels and the Congolese government, which resulted in the rebels taking control of Bunagana Town.
