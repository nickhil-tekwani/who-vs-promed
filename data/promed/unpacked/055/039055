-------------------------------------------------------------------
The following background data on hepatitis E in France were abstracted
from the Gideon database.

Incidence
---------
- 46 cases were confirmed during 2002 to 2004 -- including 16 imported cases.
- 62 cases were confirmed in southwestern France during 2003 to 2007.
- 369 cases were reported during 2006 to 2008: 264 autochthonous, 51
imported and 54 unclassified.

During 2001 to 2002, autochthonous infection was documented in 2.72
percent of acute hepatitis patients in the Midi Pyrenees area.

A case of transfusion-related hepatitis E infection was reported in 2006

Risk factors for hepatitis E in France have included water consumption
from a personal water supply, consumption of uncooked shellfish, and
the recent acquisition of a pet pig.

Prevalence surveys
------------------
- 2.5 percent of wild boar (_Sus scrofa_) livers in southeastern
France (2009 publication)

Seroprevalence surveys
----------------------
- 2.6 percent of pregnant women
- 3.2 percent of blood donors (2007 publication)
- 16.6 percent of blood donors in southwestern France (2008 publication)
- 40 percent of piglets in southern France (2009 publication)

Notable outbreaks
-----------------
- 1983 to 1984 -- outbreaks of presumed hepatitis E infection were
reported among French soldiers in Chad.
2008 (publication year) -- an outbreak (2 cases) in Southern France
was related to ingestion of raw pig meat.
