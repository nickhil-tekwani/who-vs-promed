A 2 year old boy died of H5N1 avian flu in Indonesia last month [April 2014], WHO said in an update posted yesterday [21 May 2014].

The boy, from Central Java [Jawa Tengah province], 1st had symptoms on [10 Apr 2014], was hospitalized [13 Apr 2014], and died [20 Apr 2014], WHO said in its most recent "Influenza at the Human-Animal Interface" report, dated [5 May 2014]. "In the weeks before disease onset of the child, some backyard chickens died around the house," the report said.

The boy's death represents the 1st case of H5N1 this year [2014] in Indonesia, a country that has seen as many as 55 confirmed cases in a year (in 2006), but last year reported only 3.

In the report, WHO placed the global number of lab-confirmed H5N1 cases since 2003 at 665, 392 of which have been fatal. That number represents 15 new cases and 6 newly reported deaths since the agency last updated its case count, on [24 Jan 2014].

The 15 cases not included in WHO's [24 Jan 2014] count reflect 9 in Cambodia, 3 in Egypt, and 1 each in Canada, Vietnam, and China, according to previous news reports. In addition, Hong Kong officials on [25 Feb 2014] reported an H5 infection in a child in mainland China but did not issue a follow-up report about the specific strain.

[As mentioned above, this is the 1st reported case of human infection with influenza A, H5N1 in Indonesia this year (2014). Since 2003, Indonesia has reported 195 human cases of H5N1 infection, including 163 deaths.

In 2014, ProMED-mail has reported on human infections with H5N1 in a Canadian with a history of visiting China, Egypt and Viet Nam in January; in Viet Nam, China and Cambodia in February; in Cambodia and Egypt in March; and in Egypt in April (see prior ProMED-mail posts below).
