Anthrax vaccination program paused
-------------------------------------
The Department of Defense is currently reviewing a preliminary
injunction issued today [Sun 31 Oct 2004] by the U.S. District Court
for the District of Columbia regarding the department's anthrax
vaccination program. The injunction did not question the safety and
effectiveness of the anthrax vaccine or the immunization program in
the DoD. The injunction centered on FDA procedural issues stating
that additional public comment should have been sought before the FDA
issued its final ruling in December 2003.
The Defense Department's anthrax vaccination program is an important
force protection measure. Research conducted by several prominent
medical experts and a report by the National Academy of Sciences has
determined that the anthrax vaccine is safe and effective for all
forms of anthrax exposure.
As a result of the injunction, the Department of Defense will pause
in giving anthrax vaccinations until the legal situation is clarified.
Today's [Sun 31 Oct 2004] ruling is similar to the judge's injunction
issued in December 2003. At that time, DoD paused the vaccination
program pending clarification of the legal issues. The 2003
injunction was lifted roughly two weeks later.
DoD remains convinced that the anthrax immunization program complies
with all the legal requirements and that the anthrax vaccine is safe
and effective.

AVIP Anti-anthrax vaccination program:
<http://www.anthrax.mil/resource/qna/qaAll.asp?cID=109>
1) Executive Summary.
"A few people claim the Department of Defense (DoD) added squalene to
anthrax vaccine to stretch the vaccine supply. 4 civilian panels have
looked into these allegations since 1999 and repeatedly found them
groundless. Neither DoD nor anybody else added squalene to anthrax
vaccine for our troops. DoD does not conduct illegal experiments.
Details and links to independent sources of data appear below.

4) Does the anthrax vaccine contain squalene?
Maybe. Some lab tests come up positive for squalene.
Because of the difficulty of removing squalene-containing fingerprint
oils from laboratory glassware, it is hard to know whether the
squalene is truly present in some lots of the vaccine or is
introduced by the testing process itself. DoD, the Food & Drug
Administration (FDA), and several civilian advisory committees agree
that squalene at such low levels has no adverse health consequences.
In September 2000, DoD became aware of FDA test results finding trace
amounts of squalene in 3 out of 3 US vaccines tested: tetanus,
diphtheria, and anthrax. The level of squalene identified by the FDA
test is so minute that it is likely the result of squalene in the oil
of a fingerprint not completely cleaned from lab glassware.
It is hard to completely remove fingerprint oils from glassware.
Before they go looking for squalene, lab workers have to use a
chemical solvent such as hexane to completely remove their own
fingerprint oils from lab glassware. When lab workers intentionally
tested an extract of fingerprint oil, the squalene reading went off
the chart.
Before the FDA test results became known, Stanford Research
International (SRI), under DoD contract, looked for squalene in
anthrax vaccine. At the limit of detection of its test, 140 parts per
billion, SRI found no squalene in several lots of anthrax vaccine.
The FDA's test, which was developed later, is more sensitive. It is
able to detect as little as 10 parts per billion. The FDA found
squalene at 10 to 83 parts per billion in diphtheria toxoid, tetanus
toxoid, and anthrax vaccine. The trace level of squalene found by the
FDA in anthrax vaccine is less than the concentration naturally
present in human blood (250 parts per billion) (Miettinen, 1982;
Nikkila et al, 1992).
After the FDA reported its results, DoD asked SRI to refine its
assay. Using an improved method that could detect as little as one
part per billion, SRI found no squalene in 32 out of 33 lots of
anthrax vaccine tested (including lots in which FDA found low levels
of squalene). In one lot, they found up to 9 parts per billion.
[clip]
13) Did DoD mislead or lie to anybody about the squalene tests
conducted by SRI?
No. DoD truthfully and fully reported its findings at each step since
May 1999, when SRI 1st developed its squalene test. DoD did not know
of FDA's findings until they were publicly released.
At the initial limit of detection of its test, 140 parts per billion,
SRI found no squalene in anthrax vaccine (Spanggord et al., 2002). It
was scientifically proper to say "no squalene was found to the limit
of detection of the assay," which DoD officials sometimes
oversimplified to say "there is no squalene present."
14) Has anyone, anywhere, found squalene added as an adjuvant to any
US-licensed vaccine?
No.
15) Where did the squalene FDA found in its anthrax vaccine tests come from?
The most likely source of the trace squalene in the FDA tests is the
result of squalene in the oil of a fingerprint not cleaned from lab
glassware. Squalene is not added to anthrax vaccine or any
US-licensed vaccine. It is hard to completely remove fingerprint oils
from glassware. Lab workers have to use a chemical solvent such as
hexane to completely remove fingerprint oils from lab glassware.

17) Did the British government test its anthrax vaccine for squalene?
Yes, The United Kingdom's Ministry of Defense arranged for an
independent laboratory to test 11 lots of the British anthrax vaccine
manufactured at Porton Down, as well as other vaccines. No squalene
was detected in those lots of vaccine, with a limit of detection of
0.1 microgram/ml (100 parts per billion). See:
<http://www.mod.uk/issues/gulfwar/info/medical/squalene.htm>
[clip]
19) Have any independent panels evaluated the claims of researchers
to find anti-squalene antibodies in the blood of ill Gulf War
veterans?
Yes, 4 independent civilian panels considered the February 2000
article by Asa and colleagues and other allegations related to
squalene and anti-squalene antibodies.
When the Institute of Medicine (part of the National Academy of
Sciences) Committee on Gulf War and Health (the "Sox committee")
evaluated the 2000 Asa claims of anti-squalene antibodies in the
blood of ill Gulf War veterans, it concluded that the paper contains
shortcomings, some serious, that combine to invalidate the authors'
conclusions. The report says: "The committee does not regard this
study as providing evidence that the investigators have successfully
measured antibodies to squalene." See
<http://www.nap.edu/books/030907178X/html>,
pages 311-312.
The civilian experts on the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board (AFEB)
said in July 2000, "the research reported in this paper does not
support this claim;  it remains unclear if the assay actually
measures antibodies to squalene, as the authors assert"
<http://www.ha.osd.mil/afeb/reports/squalene.pdf>
Regarding assertions that Service Members who received anthrax
vaccination from the 5 lots cited in the FDA squalene tests
experienced more or more severe adverse events after vaccination, the
civilian physicians on the Anthrax Vaccine Expert Committee (AVEC)
evaluated adverse events by lot and geographic location. They found
no meaningful differences based on lot or on geographic location.
(Sever et al. 2002
<http://www.anthrax.mil/media/pdf/AVEC_ms.pdf>,
especially pages 198-200, and Sever et al, 2004
<http://www.anthrax.mil/media/pdf/SeverArticle.pdf>,
especially pages 13-15).
Of note, the 5 lots cited in the FDA squalene tests were shipped to
multiple DoD installations. In addition, Dover AFB received lots
other than the 5 lots mentioned above.
After the comprehensive review of anthrax vaccine safety by the
National Academy of Sciences (the "Strom Committee," March 2002,
<http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10310.html>),
which included hearing from personnel, from Dover AFB and elsewhere,
concerned that they suffered adverse events after anthrax
vaccination, the civilian physicians and scientists concluded that
"The [SRI] study report, dated 14 Aug 2001, found that one lot of
over 30 lots tested contained measurable levels of squalene. 3
samples from that lot [FAV008] contained squalene at 7, 9, and
approximately one parts per billion, respectively. Use of vaccine
from that lot has not been associated with elevated rates of adverse
events.  Because the available data ... demonstrate that the
presence of trace amounts of squalene is not associated with an
increase in the rates of adverse events following vaccination with
AVA, the committee concludes that further investigation of possible
AVA contamination is not warranted at this time."
[clip]
22) What did the competitively funded research project find regarding
squalene antibodies?
( ... )
The 3rd study from this research effort, published in 2004, adapts
the test described above, so that it could detect anti-squalene
antibodies if present in human serum. Serum from 3 groups of people
were tested: retired employees of the US Army Medical Research
Institute of Infectious Diseases (average 68 years of age, 88 percent
of whom received anthrax vaccine, mean = 26 doses per person),
civilian volunteers of similar age from Frederick, Maryland (none of
whom received anthrax vaccine), and random blood donors from Fort
Knox, Kentucky (vaccination status unknown). This next study
indicates that anti-squalene antibodies are found in 7.5 percent of
the vaccinated USAMRIID alumni, 15 percent of the unvaccinated
Frederick civilians, and in zero percent of the Fort Knox blood
donors. The antibodies described in the previous sentence were a type
of antibody called IgG. Researchers found another type of
anti-squalene antibody called IgM in all 3 groups (37 percent, 32
percent, 19 percent). The researchers found that anti-squalene
antibodies are more common with increasing age (a characteristic also
found in mice). The presence of anti-squalene antibodies was
unrelated to anthrax vaccination status. They concluded that
anti-squalene antibodies occur naturally in humans (Matyas et al.,
2004).

24) Could squalene concerns have anything to do with various reported
clusters of illnesses among people given anthrax vaccine?
A panel of civilian physicians selected by the Department of Health &
Human Services reviewed all reports of adverse events after anthrax
vaccination from 1998 to 2001 (Sever et al, 2002; Sever et al, 2004).
This panel was known as the Anthrax Vaccine Expert Committee (AVEC)
To evaluate assertions that Service Members who received anthrax
vaccination from the 5 lots cited in the FDA squalene tests
experienced more or more severe adverse events after vaccination,
these civilian physicians evaluated adverse events by lot and
geographic location. They found no meaningful differences based on
lot or on geographic location."
