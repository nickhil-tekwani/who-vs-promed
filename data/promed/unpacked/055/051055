Cow deaths blamed on rare botulism strain
-----------------------------------------------
Experts now believe a rare strain of botulism is to blame for a suspected
outbreak of the disease at a dairy farm near Murray Bridge.
Mark Schubert has had to put down 70 of his 184 cows in the past 2 weeks.
There were concerns that a vaccine which protects the animals from the more
common C and D strains had not worked. But Mr. Schubert says the latest
test results show the vaccine did work. He says vets are now focusing their
tests on type B, which has never been found in Australian cattle before.

[Botulism is a fatal toxemia caused by ingestion of the toxin of
_Clostridium botulinum_. There are 8 recognized types and subtypes of the
organisms. Botulism toxins C and D, which are the ones related to cattle,
are generally regarded as non-pathogenic to humans.
The sporulating anaerobic gram-positive bacillus _C. botulinum_ elaborates
7 types of antigenetically distinct neurotoxins, 4 of which affect humans:
type A, B, E, or rarely type F. Toxin types A and B are highly poisonous
proteins resistant to digestion by GI enzymes.
Approximately 50 percent of human foodborne outbreaks in the USA are caused
by type A toxin, followed by types B and E.
_C. botulinum_ spores are relatively heat-resistant, though high
temperatures and/or exposure to moist heat will kill the spores.
Toxins, on the other hand, are readily destroyed by heat and by cooking
food. Toxin production (especially type E) can occur at temperatures as low
as 3 degrees C (37.4 degrees F), i.e. inside a refrigerator, and does not
require strict anaerobic conditions.
In many cases, and probably in the current case, the suspicion is based
upon clinical observations of the characteristic motor paralysis and the
elimination of other causes of motor paralysis. Laboratory confirmation is
difficult and not always possible. It is based upon toxicity of stomach and
intestinal filtrates in mice, but a negative answer -- which is not
exceptional -- is unreliable.
Vaccines against _Cl. botulinum_ toxins types C and D in cattle and other
farm animals (small ruminants, horses) are available and widely applied in
countries such as Australia, South Africa, and Israel.
As this article states, although the vaccine appears to be working, what is
affecting the animals may be from another strain. - Mod.TG]
