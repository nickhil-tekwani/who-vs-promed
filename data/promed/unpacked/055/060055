Turkish Cypriot cattle suffering from LSD
-----------------------------------------
Reports from the north on Wednesday [3 Dec 2014] said vets were concerned over an increase in lumpy skin disease (LSD) among herds of cattle in Ayios Andronikos, Karpas and Ayia Triada.

According to Turkish Cypriot newspaper Kibris, farmers were anxious over the outbreak and all measures were being taken to stop the disease from spreading.

The LSD virus mainly affects cattle. It is spread by insect bites. Symptoms include fever, discharge from the eyes and nose and skin lesions among others. It is sometimes fatal. Quarantine restrictions are of limited use and vaccination is the best method of control.

In statements to Kibris, the chairman of the Turkish Cypriot association of veterinarians Umut Sagili said the disease mostly likely came from Turkey through hay shipments containing the insects.

Sagili accused the 'authorities' in the north of not taking the appropriate measures necessary for the import of hay from Turkey or other countries.

The 'director of veterinary services' Ramadan Gkioksan said that all necessary measures were being taken. He said he was in contact with authorities in the government-controlled areas, which would take its own measures, he said.

[Descriptions in the 3 Dec 2014 daily "Kibris", published in (Turkish) Northern Cyprus, underline the reliability of the news on LSD in the said territory (report, in Turkish, at http://www.kibrisgazetesi.com/?p=586681). One of the affected locations is the north-eastern village Yesilkoy (map at http://itouchmap.com/?c=cy&UF=-2738132&UN=-3800805&DG=PPL). Other locations mentioned are Sipahi, Yenierenkoy and Boltasi.

Lumpy skin disease, an OIE-listed disease, is a poxviral disease with significant morbidity in cattle. Although the mortality rate is generally low, losses occur from decreased milk production, abortion, infertility, loss of condition and damaged hides. For a technical factsheet, images, information on vaccines and more, please visit http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/DiseaseInfo/disease.php?name=lumpy-skin-disease&lang=en.

LSD has been spreading during the recent 3 years in the eastern Mediterranean countries and further north-east; the outbreaks reported to the OIE since late 2012 are presented in the global OIE interactive map at http://tinyurl.com/phlkdjj (click on the cluster, then zoom in).

Vaccination has been found to be the most if not only effective way to control LSD, a vector-borne disease, after its introduction. Two vaccines have been applied in the LSD affected countries:

1. Live attenuated RM 65 sheep pox strain (fortified) "POX-10,"
2. Live attenuated LSD vaccine "Neethling" strain.

During 2013, a comparative vaccination trial, applying both vaccines, was undertaken in Israel by the "Hachaklait" Clinical Veterinary Services in cooperation with the Koret School of Veterinary Medicine/Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The test was performed on 15 large dairy farms; 4229 animals were vaccinated with the RM65 vaccine and 4222 with the "Neethling" vaccine. As apparent from the results, presented during Israel's 26th annual dairy science conference (Ashkelon, 29-30 Oct 2014), the Neethling vaccine conferred better protection from day 15 post-vaccination and onwards. Additional details are expected to be included in the paper when published. (Thanks to "Hachaklait" for the above data.)

LSDV is currently circulating in territories bordering 3 EU Member-States. Being a vector-borne disease, this means a serious threat of spreading into them. The infected territories are Turkey's and (Turkish) North Cyprus; the countries at risk are Greece, Bulgaria and the Republic of Cyprus. In the latter case, the risk is rather immediate.

Though the media-derived information from North Cyprus convincingly describes clinical LSD, official confirmation will be helpful.- Mod.AS
