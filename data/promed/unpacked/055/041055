The Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) was notified of the presence of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2) in domestic rabbits on a Hockley County premises on 10 Apr 2020. This is the 1st confirmed case of RHDV2 in Texas.

RHDV2 is a fatal viral disease affecting both domestic and wild rabbits, including hares, jackrabbits, and cottontails. It does not affect human health or affect other animal species.

The RHDV2 strain is a rare disease in the US and was 1st identified on several islands in Washington state in July 2019. Since then, it has been confirmed in both wild and domestic rabbits in New Mexico and Arizona.

The highly contagious foreign animal disease spreads between rabbits through contact with infected rabbits or carcasses, their meat or their fur, contaminated food or water, or materials coming in contact with them. RHDV2 can persist in the environment for a very long time. These factors make disease control efforts extremely challenging once it is in the wild rabbit populations.

"Vaccines are not available or approved for use in Texas at this time," said Dr. Andy Schwartz, state veterinarian and TAHC executive director. "It is of the upmost importance that rabbit owners practice strong biosecurity in order to protect and mitigate the risk of disease in their rabbit herds.

Protecting your rabbits with biosecurity
---------------------------------------
The following procedures can reduce the chance of RHDV2 and other contagious diseases from affecting domestic rabbits.
- House rabbits indoors, if possible
- Do not allow pet, feral, or wild rabbits to come in contact with your rabbits or gain entry to the facility or home.
- Always wash your hands with warm soapy water between pens and before and after entering your rabbit area.
- Keep a closed rabbitry. Do not introduce new rabbits from unknown or untrusted sources.
- If you bring new rabbits into your facility or home, keep them separated from your existing rabbits. Use separate equipment for newly acquired or sick rabbits to avoid spreading disease.
- Control flies, rats, cats, dogs, birds, etc. that can physically move the virus around on their feet or body.
- Do not collect outdoor forage and browse to feed rabbits since it may be contaminated.
- Remove brush, grass, weeds, trash, and debris from the rabbitry to reduce rodents.
- Protect feed from contamination by flies, birds, rodents, etc.
- Remove and properly dispose of (i.e., bury or incinerate) dead rabbits promptly.
- When moving rabbits or restocking pens, disinfect all equipment and cages with 10% bleach mixed with water or other approved products. Properly dispose of bedding. Items made of wood are difficult to disinfect and best discarded.
- Breeders should review their biosecurity plans for gaps, and all rabbit owners should establish a working relationship with a veterinarian to review biosecurity practices for identification and closure of possible gaps.

Rabbit owners who have questions about RHDV2 or observe sudden death in their rabbits should contact their private veterinarian. Private veterinarians are requested to contact the USDA-APHIS or the TAHC to report any suspected cases at 1-800-550-8242. Report all unusual mass morbidity (sickness) or mortality (deaths) events to the TAHC.

"Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) will be monitoring wild rabbit populations to determine the extent of the disease," said Dr. Robert Dittmar, TPWD wildlife veterinarian. "RHDV2 has not yet been confirmed in the Texas wild rabbit population; however, we have seen an increase of reported mortalities in the Trans Pecos and Panhandle areas. TPWD has submitted samples to the National Wildlife Health Center for testing and are awaiting results. People can contact their local TPWD wildlife biologist if they notice sick or dead rabbits. We want to reassure everyone this disease does not affect people or pets. TPWD will work with TAHC to keep the public informed as we learn more about the extent and severity of the disease."

The TAHC is responding to RHDV2 alongside the United States Department of Agriculture, Veterinary Services (USDA-VS), and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.

["Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is caused by rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), a member of the genus _Lagovirus_ and family Caliciviridae. There are many strains and 3 major viral subtypes: RHDV ("classical RHDV"), the antigenic variant RHDVa, and the recently emerged virus RHDV2 (also called RHDVb). Classical RHDV and RHDVa comprise one serotype, while RHDV2 belongs to a different serotype.

"In rabbits less than 4-8 weeks of age, RHDV/RHDVa infections are usually subclinical. However, some young rabbits may have elevated temperatures, and subclinical signs of liver disease were noted in experimentally infected 4-week-old rabbit kittens. Deaths have also been reported, though rarely. In a recent study, experimentally infected 4-week-old rabbits died rapidly if they were immunosuppressed with corticosteroids.

"Peracute and acute disease are the most common syndromes in older rabbits. In peracute cases, infected rabbits develop a fever and die suddenly within 12-36 hours of its onset. The only clinical signs may be terminal squeals followed rapidly by collapse and death. Animals with the acute form survive somewhat longer, with signs of dullness/apathy, anorexia, congestion of the conjunctiva, and/or prostration. These animals may also develop neurological signs, such as incoordination, excitement, opisthotonos, and paddling. Some rabbits turn and flip quickly in their cages; this can resemble convulsions or mania. There may also be respiratory signs (e.g., dyspnea, cyanosis, and a terminal, bloodstained, frothy nasal discharge), lacrimation, ocular hemorrhages, or epistaxis. Animals that survive longer can develop a subacute form with severe jaundice, accompanied by weight loss and lethargy, and die in a few weeks. These animals may have diarrhea or constipation and abdominal dilatation just before death. A small number of adult rabbits can have milder signs, with a higher survival rate, or are infected subclinically. Rabbits with persistent viral RNA were apparently healthy. Iberian hares infected with classical RHDV were found dead but had lesions consistent with a disease caused by a lagovirus.

"RHDV2 affects young rabbits as well as older animals; clinical cases have been reported in rabbits as young as 11 days of age. The clinical signs are similar to the illness caused by RHDV/RHDVa; however, experimentally infected rabbits generally survived longer, and peracute or acute cases were less common. A captive Italian hare infected with RHDV2 had no clinical signs other than epistaxis before death. Wild Cape hares infected with this virus were found dead.

"Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is endemic in Australia, New Zealand, Cuba, parts of Asia and Africa, and most of Europe. The viral subtypes circulating in each region can differ. As of 2016, RHDV2 has been found in a number of European countries and Australia. RHDV is not thought to be established in North America, where _O. cuniculus_ does not occur in the wild. Outbreaks were reported among domesticated rabbits in the USA in 2000 (Iowa), 2001 (Utah, Illinois, New York), 2005 (Indiana), 2008 (Maryland), and 2010 (Minnesota). In some cases, only a single facility or household was affected. The origins of these viruses could not be traced; however, different viruses were involved in each outbreak, and they were thought to have come from outside North America. In 2011, a clinical case occurred in Canada in one of 3 rabbits that had been housed indoors for more than a year. The source of this virus is also unknown, although various hypotheses (i.e., reactivation of a persistent infection, emergence from a nonpathogenic calicivirus, or transmission from an unknown source on fomites or insects) have been proposed. RHDV was endemic in domesticated rabbits in Mexico from the late 1980s to 1991, but it was eventually eradicated. This disease was also reported from domesticated and wild rabbits in Uruguay in 2004; however, Uruguay ceased vaccination for this disease in 2007 and declared itself free of RHDV to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) in 2012.

"There is no indication that RHDV infects humans."
