A total of 2035 deaths due to cholera was recorded in the country as of last Friday [27 Aug 2021], the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has disclosed. According to the latest cholera epidemic report by the NCDC yesterday [30 Aug 2021], the total number of suspected cases of cholera infection in the 23 states of the federation was 58 698.

The NCDC report stated that "As of [27 Aug 2021], a total of 58 698 suspected cases including 2035 deaths (CFR 3.5 percent) have been reported from 23 states and FCT [Federal Capital Territory] in 2021.There was a 44 per cent decrease in the number of new suspected cases in week 33 (3098) [week of 15 Aug 2021] compared with week 32 [week of 8 Aug 2021] (5476)."

It stated that in the reporting week, "12 states reported 3098 suspected cases including, Bauchi (1145), Katsina (691), Zamfara (454), Yobe (216), Sokoto (196), Jigawa (187), Kano (80), Niger (79), Borno (30), FCT (11), Adamawa (6), and Kebbi (3). Of this, there were 35 RDT [rapid diagnostic test] confirmed cases from Katsina (14), Yobe (7), Adamawa (6), Zamfara (4), Borno (2), Jigawa (1), and FCT (1)."

Also, the disease control centre stated that 13 culture confirmed cases were from Yobe (6), Adamawa (6), and FCT (1). "In addition, there were 63 deaths from Katsina (19), Bauchi (16), Niger (7), Zamfara (6), Jigawa (4), Sokoto (4), Borno (4), Yobe (1), Kano (1), and Adamawa (1) states," it added.

It further stated that of the suspected cases since the beginning of the year, the age group 5-14 years was the most affected for both male and female and that of all suspected cases, 51 per cent were males and 49 per cent were females.

The NCDC further stated that 23 states and the FCT had so far reported suspected cholera cases in 2021. The states were Benue, Delta, Zamfara, Gombe, Bayelsa, Kogi, Sokoto, Bauchi, Kano, Kaduna, Plateau, Kebbi, Cross River, Nasarawa, Niger, Jigawa, Yobe, Kwara, Adamawa, Enugu, Katsina, Borno, Taraba, and FCT.

[Cholera continues to be an issue across many of the states of Nigeria.

As stated by Lutwick et al (Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Edited by Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J. New York: Nova Bioscience; 2017, pp 113-127), oral rehydration therapy can be lifesaving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it first recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al. (1) highlight the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30% to 3.6% (4) and quote sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally, glucose- or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 mL/kg followed by 100 mL/kg in the first 4 hours and 100 mL/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the first 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
