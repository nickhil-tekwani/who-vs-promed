[Death toll now 51. - Mod.JW
PREMIER EXPRESSES SINCERE APOLOGY OVER VIRAL OUTBREAK
[Excerpts
Taipei, June 25 (CNA). Premier Vincent Siew on Thursday apologized to the
public for an enterovirus outbreak as the Department of Health (DOH)
announced new measures to curb the spread of the intestinal virus.
The official death toll from the enterovirus has increased to 51 after a
15-month-old baby died in Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in suburban
Taipei Wednesday.
Siew said health and medical institutions have pulled all the stops in
fighting the disease and the rate of deaths and the number of those
infected have eased since the peak of the outbreak.
However, he warned that according to collected data, the epidemic has not
yet come under control.
The DOH, noting that the enterovirus is usually spread by physical contact,
mapped out
guidelines for nurseries and kindergartens Thursday following a decision
Wednesday by the Taipei City Government to suspend operations of public and
private kindergartens for the time being.
According to the guidelines, the number of students in each class must be
less than 30. If two students in the same class have been infected with the
enterovirus, the class must immediately be suspended and operators must
conduct a thorough cleaning and disinfecting of the premises.
The enterovirus usually attacks children under 5 years. The virus breaks
down the immune system and can leave infants susceptible to encephalitis,
meningitis and acute inflammation of the heart muscle.
Early symptoms are similar to the flu, including fever, headache and
vomiting. The rate of death from viral infection is low if victims are
offered timely and proper medical treatment. (By Lilian Wu)
