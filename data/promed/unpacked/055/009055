Cases of malaria-carrying mosquito bites in North Penajam Paser Regency, East Kalimantan [province in Borneo] are quite high, with 300 patients treated at local health service centers as of early 2022.

"The attack of the malaria mosquito is quite high, it has been recorded that so far it has reached 300 cases," said Ponco Waluyo, Malaria Program Manager at the North Penajam Paser District Health Office, in Penajam.

"Data on malaria sufferers were collected from each puskesmas [community health centers] in the North Penajam Paser area, throughout this year (2022)," he added.

Hundreds of residents who were detected positive for malaria are the results of reports on the management of puskesmas located in four sub-districts in North Penajam Paser Regency.

However, it is confirmed that malaria infection is dominated by areas outside Penajam Paser Utar Regency, that is, Bongan area, West Kutai Regency, and Paser Regency.

The people who tested positive for malaria, he continued, were mostly woodworkers or plantation company workers.

"The residents affected by malaria are those who work as wood craftsmen in the border areas of North Penajam Paser, Paser, and West Kutai regencies," he said.

"More than 85 percent of the incidents are above kilometer 42 of the Sotek-Bongan road, but if it is above kilometer 42, it is included in the Paser Regency area," he explained.

The North Penajam Paser District Health Office distributes mosquito nets with antimalarial insecticides every year to minimize illness caused by mosquito bites.

Antimalarial insecticidal nets assisted by the Ministry of Health or the Ministry of Health are specifically for residents living in zones or plantation areas.
