Successful control of insect vectors of citrus huanglongbing in the
islands of Reunion, Mauritius, and Guadeloupe
---------------------------------------------
In the 1970s, Reunion Island faced severe outbreaks of citrus
huanglongbing (EPPO A1 List), a disease which is transmitted by
insect vectors, _Trioza erytreae_ and _Diaphorina citri_ (both EPPO
A1 List). On Reunion Island, both '_Candidatus_ Liberibacter
africanus' and '_Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus' were detected,
sometimes in mixed infections. The main reasons for these severe
outbreaks were the following:

- presence of _Trioza erytreae_ (EPPO A1 List) in the absence of any
of its natural parasitoids, and of _Diaphorina citri_ (EPPO A1 List),
which was poorly controlled by a single species of parasitic wasp
(_Diaphorencyrtus aligarhensis_);
- great diversity of climates and topographies offering multiple
favourable sites for the vector populations to build up and for the
disease to develop;
- many ornamental and wild rutaceous host plants harbouring the 2
vector species;
- plantation of commercial citrus orchards in the vicinity of many
small citrus plantings and backyard trees;
- lack of diagnostic tools and limited research capacities.

Eradication of citrus huanglongbing was not considered feasible at
that time and an integrated control strategy was implemented, in
which training of extension consultants and farmers played an
important role. In this programme, commercial growers were strongly
encouraged to replant affected orchards with disease-free material
and a biological control programme was launched in 1974. Parasitic
wasps, _Tamarixia dryi_ and _Tamarixia radiata_ (Hymenoptera:
Chalcidoidea) originating from Africa and Asia respectively, were
reared and released across the island. _Tamarixia dryi_ successfully
controlled populations of _Trioza erytreae_, which were mainly
present in the cool and wet areas of higher altitudes. The control
was so successful that _Trioza erytreae_ is no longer observed in
Reunion.

Similarly, _Tamarixia radiata_ provided effective control of _D.
citri_, which was mainly occurring in the dry and hot coastal areas.
However, _D. citri_ survived on pruned hedges of _Murraya exotica_
but is now rarely seen on citrus, even on neglected trees. Today in
Reunion Island, huanglongbing is no longer causing economic problems
in citrus orchards, nevertheless it is suggested that it would be
advisable to search for the last remaining foci in order to eradicate
the disease completely. It is noted that similar results were
obtained in the neighbouring Island of Mauritius, where the same
control strategy was applied.

In Guadeloupe, citrus huanglongbing has never been detected but one
of its insect vectors, _Diaphorina citri_, was first found in January
1998 on backyard orange trees. In January 1999, the release of
_Tamarixia radiata_ was decided. The rearing and release of a few
hundred wasps did succeed in establishing and subsequently reducing
_D. citri_ populations in backyard citrus trees, in hedges of
_Murraya exotica_, and across the 360 hectares [900 acres] of
commercial citrus orchards.

2009/088 Cultivation of '_Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus', '_Ca._
L. africanus', and '_Ca._ L. americanus'
----------------------------------------
Huanglongbing (EPPO A1 List) is a citrus disease associated with
several phloem-limited bacteria, which had previously not been able
to be cultured (in particular to verify Koch's postulates). A new
growing medium (called Liber A) has been designed and used
successfully to cultivate the three species of '_Candidatus_
Liberibacter' associated with huanglongbing (that is, '_Ca._
Liberibacter asiaticus', '_Ca._ L. africanus', and '_Ca._ L.
americanus').

Two strains of '_Ca._ L. asiaticus' and one strain of '_Ca._ L.
americanus were found to be pathogenic on citrus and were re-isolated
from tissues of inoculated trees and seedlings 9 and 2 months after
inoculation (by leaf infiltration), respectively. It is considered
that Koch's postulates have not been fully completed by inoculating
mature trees and reproducing the entire disease etiology. However,
this partial fulfilment of Koch's postulates showed that both '_Ca._
L. asiaticus' and '_Ca._ L. americanus' are pathogens of citrus,
causing huanglongbing-like symptoms, and are likely to be major
components of the disease (although it cannot be excluded that the
disease might be a syndrome involving other factors).

[Huanglongbing (HLB; also called citrus greening), is one of the most
damaging diseases of citrus crops. It occurs throughout much of Asia,
sub-Saharan Africa, and parts of the Americas but has not been
reported from the Mediterranean or Australia. As causal pathogens,
_Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus, _Ca._ L. africanus, and _Ca._ L.
americanus have been reported from different regions.

The disease is restricted to _Citrus_ and close relatives because of
the narrow host range of its natural vectors. The Asian citrus
psyllid _Diaphorina citri_ is the vector for both _Ca._ L. asiaticus
and americanus. The African citrus psyllid _Trioza erytreae_ is the
vector for _Ca._ L. africanus. The pathogens can also be transmitted
by grafting, dodder (a parasitic vine), and possibly by seed from
infected plants or transovarially in the vectors. (For more
information on HLB, see links and previous posts listed below.)

HLB disease management is difficult and usually requires an
integrated approach including use of clean planting and grafting
stock, elimination of inoculum, cultural methods (such as
interplanting of guava), and vector control in orchards and non-crop
reservoirs. The report in item [1] above suggests that it may be
possible to control HLB effectively by using biological agents to
control its vectors, at least in confined areas like island
environments. This is an important finding and useful information for
HLB control programmes elsewhere.

Liberibacters are highly fastidious phloem inhabiting bacteria, which
until now could not be cultured. Therefore Koch's postulates, a set
of rules to establish causality by using pure pathogen cultures to
reproduce disease in the host, could not be tested for HLB. The
research reported in item [2] has provided an important tool for
future work on these pathogens by providing a method for their in
vitro culture.
