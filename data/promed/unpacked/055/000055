The Las Higueras de Talcahuano Hospital confirmed the death of the
latest hantavirus [infection] patient in the Bio-Bio region. The
report on Tue 5 Apr [2011] by the Public Health Institute confirmed a
34-year-old man, resident of the Santa Teresa sector in the Yumbel
community, as the 5th case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in the area.

The patient died in the Las Higueras Hospital where he was in serious
condition in the intensive care unit of the facility. The risk factor
was his collection, 3 weeks ago, of rose hips, which presented ideal
conditions for the presence of the rodent [host of Andes virus].

The Health SEREMI [Regional Ministerial Secretariat] reiterated
prevention measures, such as keeping the surroundings of houses free
of weeds and trash, exterminating rodents and sealing sheds and
storehouses, and ventilating for about 30 minutes before entering
places that have remained closed for a long time.

Nationally, 24 confirmed hantavirus [infections] have been registered
[this year, 2011] and this is the 3rd with a fatal outcome in the
region.

[This is the suspected case reported on 31 Mar 2011 (ProMED-mail
archive number 20110331.0998) that has now been confirmed as a
fatality. The hantavirus involved in this case is most likely Andes
virus.

Saguache County Public Health Director Della Vieira on Thursday [7
Apr 2011] confirmed that a death has been associated with [a]
hantavirus [infection]. The laboratory at the Colorado Department of
Public Health and Environment has confirmed the deceased was exposed
to the virus. To protect confidentiality, Saguache County Public
Health is unable to disclose the identity of the deceased Saguache
County resident.

In the San Luis Valley, [Sin Nombre] hantavirus is carried by deer
mice [_Peromyscus maniculatus_]. Other rodents have been found to be
infected, but these do not occur in this area. Testing has shown that
typically 10-15 percent of deer mice are infected [field studies of
Sin Nombre virus prevalence has shown considerable year-to-year
variability in _P. maniculatus_ in areas endemic for this virus. -
Mod.TY] Household pets (including rodents) do not get sick from the
virus. The virus is not spread by insects or from person to person.

Hantavirus can be found in the urine, saliva, and droppings of
infected mice. People are infected by breathing in the virus when
stirring up dust from mouse nests or mouse droppings in areas with
poor ventilation, or when handling mice. People are at risk for
hantavirus when cleaning barns, outbuildings, sheds, and clearing wood
piles that might contain mouse droppings. People who go into crawl
spaces below homes, attics, or other closed spaces with rodent
droppings also are at risk.

To clean up rodent infested areas open doors and windows and allow a
room to air out for 30 minutes before going inside. Wear rubber
gloves, and spray droppings, nests and carcasses with bleach and water
solution (1.5 cups bleach per 1 gallon water, or 1 part bleach to 9
parts water, mixed that day). Let soak for 5-10 minutes before
cleaning up with a mop, sponge, or wet-vacuum. Do not sweep or
dry-vacuum mouse droppings. Consider using a respirator mask (N-100
rating) that seals tightly to the face. After disinfecting, place
mouse carcasses, nests, and cleaning materials into a plastic bag. Tie
the bag shut and put it in an outdoor trashcan. Wash hands and
clothing after clean up.

[Sin Nombre] hantavirus is a very real threat in the San Luis Valley.
People may see rodents in their houses, vehicles, tool sheds, barns,
etc. Take care when opening outbuildings, or when you find mouse
droppings and mice around the house.

[As is often the case, these types of reports suggest that there is
just one species of hantavirus, when, in fact, there are many, several
capable of causing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. The virus involved
in this fatal case is most likely Sin Nombre virus.
