[According to the OIE WAHID database, H5N1 avian influenza has never been
reported before in Bhutan. However, there have been outbreaks in areas
surrounding Bhutan including Bangladesh, West Bengal, and Sikkim in India
and Nepal -- last year (2009). So it is not entirely surprising to see H5N1
avian influenza show up for the 1st time. Animal health authorities in the
country should be very careful at this point to make sure it doesn't spread
because containing this disease upon entry into the country has proved to
be a great challenge, especially if it is in commercial poultry. - Mod.PC

report. The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Bhutan is available at
