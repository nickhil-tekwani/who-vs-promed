Black gill continues to wreak havoc on the shrimp population and stakeholders in this issue are springing into action.

This is caused by a parasite that essentially makes it impossible for the shrimp to breathe and the number of afflicted shrimp is rising. This condition has been seen in previous years, but typically appears closer to August.

A meeting to discuss research efforts and effects of this epidemic will be held from 1 to 4 p.m. on Wed 22 Jun [2016] at the UGA aquarium in Savannah. Shrimpers, fish house owners, wholesalers, and anyone interested in these research efforts are invited to attend.

[Black gill syndrome is a disease of shrimp and prawns (Family Panaeidae). It causes a disruption of the gill processes, leading to secondary infections. In the Atlantic coast of North America, the disease 1st appeared in 1999. A protozoan is implicated, but the syndrome is predominantly multicausal, with environmental factors playing a key role.
