Seasonal Canine Illness; what are we doing to beat it?
------------------------------------------------------
In September 2010 the Estate Manager at Her Majesty the Queen's Sandringham Estate, Norfolk, alerted the Animal Health Trust (AHT) to an emerging syndrome that had been reported over the previous couple of years in dogs being walked on the estate. The AHT also became aware around this time of reports of a similar syndrome occurring in dogs walked in other woodland areas, particularly in several sites in Nottinghamshire. Due to its apparent autumnal occurrence but unknown cause the condition became known as 'Seasonal Canine Illness' or SCI. The AHT initially started investigating in 4 study areas; Sandringham Estate and Thetford Forest (Norfolk), and Sherwood Forest and Clumber Park (Nottinghamshire). An extra study area, Rendlesham Forest (Suffolk) was included in 2011.

The Animal Health Trust created a questionnaire which we asked dog owners who had walked their dogs in any of the study areas to complete. We asked for information from people whose dogs had been taken ill and those whose dogs hadn't been taken ill. Information from owners of dogs which have not been taken ill after walking at the study sites is incredibly valuable to our investigation as it helps us to rule things out.

We had a great response to our plea for information; total number of questionnaires returned to date - 602. Of these, 157 (26 percent) were from dogs that were taken ill. Out of all the dogs that have become ill, only 15 have died.

Site visits:

In September 2011, shortly after the first cases of 2011 were reported, we visited one of our study sites with British field botanist, Dr Mark Spencer of the Natural History Museum. The aim of this visit was to investigate the possibility that a naturally occurring toxin, from a poisonous plant or fungi, could be causing these clinical signs in dogs.

During a visit to the Sandringham Estate, where a number of cases of SCI have occurred, Dr. Spencer stated that there was no obvious evidence of any plants which would cause the clinical signs of SCI in dogs through contact alone.

The botanist was confident that there was nothing unusual in the woodlands and that all plants would probably have been growing there for more than 50 years.

The expert opinion also enabled suggested theories of possible causes to be considered much less likely by the investigation. These theories include toxic effects from:

- blue-green algae
- non-native plants
- bracken spores
- fungi

As with any investigation, this is a process of elimination. Whilst we cannot rule plants and these other toxic causes out completely, we have begun to focus our efforts on looking at other natural sources. Further site visits are planned for 2012.

Recent updates:

In the last few days, we have been made aware of a cluster of possible SCI cases near Thetford with dogs becoming ill with clinical signs matching those seen with SCI cases. At the moment we are awaiting confirmation as to whether these dogs had recently been exposed to woodland shortly before becoming ill, consistent with our current definition of SCI.

We have been made aware of another possible case in Nottinghamshire from a veterinary practice that has previously treated cases in the past few years.Thanks to funding from the Kennel Club Charitable Trust we have been able to appoint a full-time Seasonal Canine Illness Research Co-ordinator for 2012.

Given the evidence from previous years, we strongly expect cases of SCI to reoccur in autumn 2012 (usually in late August / early September). Our investigation continues to involve a number of AHT scientists and vets, as well as experts at other institutions.

There is still much to be done before a definitive cause can be pin-pointed but we are confident that the search area is narrowing.
