Southern Region Water Board [SRWB] is now testing Shire River water at Liwonde to find if it was contaminated with [_Bacilus anthracis_] which has killed 28 hippopotamuses so far. SRWB spokesperson Rita Makwangwala has confirmed that the board is testing the water at Liwonde in order to find out the extent of the contamination. "But our consumers should be assured that the water is safe. We are ensuring that the water is safe for drinking as we are doing the tests." she said.

An official at Balaka District Hospital Katanga Kaunda said the [possible] anthrax contamination of the water at Liwonde was a health risk. "There is need to get the water tested for [_B. anthracis_] in an independent laboratory," said Kaunda. This follows tests conducted at the Central Veterinary Laboratory, instituted by the Ministry of Health (MOH), results of which indicated that there was _Bacillus anthracis_, a [bacterium] that causes anthrax, in the hippo's system.

The hippos have been dying in the upper side of the Shire River all the way to Liwonde Barrage. They started dying mid-September [2018] but the 1st carcasses were seen floating on [10 Oct 2018].

[It is logical to test the river water both for epidemiological investigative reasons and to reassure the villagers living along the river that the water is safe. Empirically as there have been no human cases to date, any water contamination is below the necessary minimal infective dose and the vegetative cells of _B. anthracis_ do not survive passage through the acid contents of one's stomach. But throats might get infected.

I am informed by a colleague in Lilongwe that the veterinary service is staking the hippo carcasses on the river banks for the crocodiles to deal with, a novel approach. In the rainy season this part of the park is flooded so we can presume that any soil contamination will be washed downstream come that time. Faced with burning or burying 28 hippo carcasses I can see why this choice was made. Good luck! - Mod.MHJ
