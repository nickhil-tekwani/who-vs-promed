Suspected encephalitis has killed more than 100 children in the
northern Indian state of Bihar since June [2011], reported local media
Saturday [1 Oct 20110]. At least 51 children in Bihar's Gaya district
died of the epidemic in the last 7 weeks, in the wake of the death of
55 children in a similar outbreak of the brain disease in another
district of the state earlier, reported Indo-Asian News Service. Most
of the children belong to a caste known for its absolute poverty.

According to district health officials, all children have died at
Anugrah Narain Medical College and Hospital in Gaya, about 100 km [62
mi] from the state capital Patna. The children reported high fever,
followed by bouts of unconsciousness and convulsions. So far, more
than 220 children with suspected encephalitis were admitted for
treatment, with more than 2 dozen of them still battling for life,
according to the report.

Earlier, Indian Health and Family Welfare Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad
said clinical and epidemiological data suggested that there was an
outbreak of acute encephalitis syndrome, resulting in 150 cases and 55
deaths, mostly among children, from early June to mid-July [2011] in
the Muzaffarpur district of Bihar.

[A 19 Sep 2011 report from the Gaya district in Bihar state stated
that there were 3 fatal cases of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)
infection in the Gaya area (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20110923.2885). The report above does not explicitly state that some
of the 150 cases and 55 deaths were due to JEV infections. Instead,
they are reported as "acute encephalitis syndrome" (AES), an
undiagnosed infection that has been frequently reported across
northeastern India this year (2011). It would be helpful to know what
the etiologies of the AES cases are.

Gaya is the 2nd largest city in Bihar state and the capital of the
district. It can be located via the HealthMap Interactive map at
