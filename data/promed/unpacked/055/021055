Families are being advised to double-bag their chicken and store it away from other food in the fridge as bacteria have been found on the outside of packaging. _Campylobacter_, a bacterium commonly found in raw [or undercooked - Mod.LL] chicken, is present on the external packaging of thousands of British chickens sold in the UK, according to a Food Standards Agency (FSA) report to be published this week. It will warn that chicken, even if it is packaged, will now need to be kept away from children and in a separate bag in the fridge.

"The biggest risk is in food preparation, as this is when the bacterium is likely to spread to surfaces or hands," a spokesman told the Daily Telegraph. "But you could put raw poultry in a separate bag as well, as there is always a small risk that the bacteria are also on the packaging."

Earlier in 2014, the FSA named _Campylobacter_ as the biggest cause of foodborne illness, ahead of _Clostridium perfringens_ and the norovirus.

A preliminary study by the FSA in August 2014 found that the bacterium was on the outside of chicken packaging in 4 percent of cases.

Agency officials were so concerned about _Campylobacter_ contamination of chicken that it launched a survey of the meat on sale in supermarkets with the intention of regularly publishing a 'name and shame' list, and said: "Poultry meat was the food linked to the most cases of foodborne illness, with an estimated 244 000 cases every year."

The British Retail Consortium said it supported the FSA's objective to reduce _Campylobacter_ and added that "retailers... are investing in their supply chains working with farmers and processors to identify controls. Measures implemented include introducing leak-proof packaging on all whole birds to control the spread of any contamination and provision of on-pack labelling which advises consumers on how to handle and prepare poultry."

[This is certainly not the 1st time that enteric pathogens have been reported to be found on the outside of meat packaging. Certainly the external contamination can lead to contamination of other foods in the same bag or in the refrigerator or freezer. Keeping these packages in a separate bag during shopping and during storage is not unreasonable. It is all important to note that with the increased use of reusable grocery bags, the bag itself can be contaminated and should be appropriately washed between uses. - Mod.LL
