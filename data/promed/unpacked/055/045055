[According to OIE's Terrestrial Manual (PPR Chapter, updated 2019, at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.07.09_PPR.pdf), sheep and goats vaccinated with an attenuated strain of PPR [peste des petits ruminants] or that recover from PPR develop an active life-long immunity against the disease. It will be interesting to note if the 20 reported cases in the flock (which included 3 males, 337 females, and 150 lambs) involved only unvaccinated lambs. Reportedly, the entire flock was vaccinated in March 2020. Re-vaccinating after several months is an unusual measure, probably based upon an enhanced precautionary approach, provided the efficacy of the vaccine batch used is not in doubt.

Maon, the location of the outbreak, is an Israeli settlement within the West Bank. It is situated in the so-called "Area C," in which Israeli settlements are currently administered by the Israeli Judea and Samaria Area administration (with veterinary care provided by Israel's Veterinary Services), whereas the Palestinian population is indirectly administered by the Palestinian National Authority in Ramallah (with veterinary care provided by the PA Veterinary Services). The flock's veterinary care, including diagnostic and vaccination activities, is provided by the Beer Sheva District Veterinary Office. A distribution map of the 6 district veterinary offices in Israel is available at https://moag.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=5b2be55bd3a3415cbf37480902d392cb.

Maon is situated less than 9 km [5.6 mi] from the Israeli settlement of Susya, the site of Israel's previous PPR outbreak (July 2019: 20190725.6587801), which affected goats. Both settlements are adjacent to Palestinian villages and Bedouin encampments, which are served by the Palestinian Veterinary Services (Hebron district office).

It may be assumed that PPR is circulating within the small ruminant populations of both Israel and the PA.
