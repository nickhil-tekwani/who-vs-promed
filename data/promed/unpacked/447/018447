Anthrax, human, livestock, further developments - Russia: Buryatia
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The investigation conducted by Irkutsk Antiplague Institute has
confirmed that anthrax was a cause of death of sheep in Barguzinsky
region of Buryatia.

Emercom reports that, since 3 Jul 2008, 5 sheep in district Toksoho
and one horse in the village of Bayangol died. Meanwhile it was
informed earlier that more than 40 sheep had died.

Initially the veterinary service diagnosed the illness as "bradsot"
(a clostridial infection of animals which is not normally transferred
to human). However tests in Irkutsk have yielded anthrax-positive results.

[For "bradsot" check out: Bradsot or Braxy d.t. Cl. septicum:
<http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1680202>

Disease Definition:
Malignant edema is an acute, generally fatal toxemia of cattle,
horses, sheep, goats, and pigs usually caused by Clostridium
septicum, often accompanied by other clostridial species. Other
clostridia implicated in wound infections include C chauvoei, C
perfringens, C novyi, and C sordellii. The disease occurs worldwide.
A similar infection in humans is not uncommon.
<http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/50706.htm&word=braxy>

In our experience there will be about 10 livestock outbreaks
involving clostridial causes for every one anthrax outbreak, so the
confusion is not unexpected. The problem comes in the diagnosis as
clostridia are anaerobes and once set on that route it can take time
to reset the diagnostic compass to check for aerobic pathogens. And
confusion is compounded in that veterinary help is usually not sought
promptly with a dead sheep problem until the numbers start mounting,
in this case until over 40 had died. - Mod.MHJ]

Epidemiological situation in Buryatia
-------------------------------------
In Buryatia, by 9 Jul 2008, 8 people remain in the Barguzinsky
regional hospital: 7 patients with anthrax, and one with suspected
anthrax. Three people were hospitalized earlier with suspected
anthrax and have been discharged from the hospital in satisfactory condition.

Medical observation of contact people is being done, but to date
there are no new cases of disease among the population. A complex of
preventive, antiepidemic and veterinary measures and laboratory
investigations is being carried out.

[According to a decree of the Main Sanitary Physician of Russia # 41
from 27 Jun 2008 in the Russian Federation, the epidemiological
situation with anthrax remains unstable. Over the 5 last years in
Russia, 43 human cases were registered (6 cases in 2003, 16 cases in
2004, 12 in 2005, 6 in 2006 and 3 cases in 2007), including 3 cases
with a lethal outcome (2 in 2006 and 1 in 2007). Over this period
there was disease and deaths in animals in 50 territories of Russia;
71 anthrax cases were registered. There are about 35 000
anthrax-unfavourable areas with 7940 animal burial sites. See:
