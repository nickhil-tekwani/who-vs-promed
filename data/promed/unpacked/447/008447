Crimean-Congo fever suspect admitted to Benazir Bhutto Hospital
---------------------------------------------------------------
Benazir Bhutto Hospital (BBH) received a male patient, aged 27, with
severe bleeding disorder on Saturday night [15 Nov 2008]. Senior
doctors at the hospital on Sunday evening [16 Nov 2008] suspected him
to be a case of deadly Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF).

The patient, who belongs to Hazro, Attock, reached the BBH with
continued, uncontrolled, nasal and throat bleeding. On Saturday night
[15 Nov 2008], his platelets count was recorded as 2000 [whereas]
that for a normal person ranges from 150 000 to 400 000. He was
brought to the BBH from his native town [as] a suspected case of
dengue hemorrhagic fever.

"His condition is becoming more and more critical with the passage of
time while his bleeding disorder has got more intense convincing us
to suspect CCHF," said the head of the medical unit at the BBH,
Professor Dr Shoaib Shafi, who is supervising the patient's
treatment. While talking to 'The News' on Sunday evening [16 Nov
2008], Dr Shoaib said, the patient's bleeding disorder is so much
more intense that he starts bleeding when touched by a doctor. I
believe that his blood vessels have been blocked, however we have
started a treatment protocol for CCHF." He added that they are going
to give the patient high dosage of the antiviral drug, oral ribavirin.

He said the hospital is going to send a blood sample to the National
Institute of Health, Islamabad, for [CCHF] serology. "I have informed
the principal-in-charge allied hospitals Dr Mohammad Mussadiq Khan
about the status of the patient," he said adding that the patient has
already been shifted to an isolation unit.

It is important [to remember] that nearly 5 years back, Dr Farzana
Altaf of Holy Family Hospital died after developing CCHF while
treating a CCHF patient.

"Immediate (close) family members, attendants, and medical staff
involved in treatment of a CCHF patient might be at risk if proper
preventive measures are not taken and for that purpose, we have
notified all attendants of the patient of his status," said Dr
Shoaib. He said that doctors who had contact with the patient have
started taking medicines [ribavirin?] as a preventive measure, and
medication for attendants has also been started.

Viral hemorrhagic fever such as CCHF and Ebola are zoonotic diseases
that animals [transmit] to humans. The mortality rate of hemorrhagic
fevers ranges from 50 to 90 percent. Dr Shoaib said that the patient
has a history of animal contact, as some of his family members are
butchers by profession. CCHF is caused by a nairovirus of the family
_Bunyaviridae_, which is transmitted to humans by the bite of
Hyalomma species ticks or by direct contact with blood from an
infected animal or human. CCHF [virus] was first described in Crimea
in 1944 and identified in 1956 in Congo.

According to World Health Organization (WHO) data, nearly 300
confirmed cases of CCHF have so far been reported in Pakistan from
1976 to 2003. The disease was first reported in Pakistan in 1976 but
the number of cases has shown a dramatic rise since 2000 with 50 to
60 patients being reported annually.

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is prevalent throughout rural
regions of Pakistan, although the majority of reports reaching
ProMED-mail have originated from Baluchistan.

The signs and symptoms of the patient's illness are consistent with
the suspected diagnosis of CCHF, as is his background of possible
exposure to contaminated animal blood.

Laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis is awaited. According to the
US CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) laboratory tests
that can be used to diagnose CCHF include antigen-capture
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), real time polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR), virus isolation attempts, and detection of
antibody by ELISA (IgG and IgM). Laboratory diagnosis of a patient
with a clinical history compatible with CCHF can be made during the
acute phase of the disease by using the combination of detection of
the viral antigen (ELISA antigen capture), and viral RNA sequence
(RT-PCR) in the blood.

Attock district and city are located on the northern border of Punjab
province of Pakistan and can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail
