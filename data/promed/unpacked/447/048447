Another disease outbreak confirmed
----------------------------------
A 2nd [see comment in item 2] case of foot and mouth [disease] [FMD] has
been confirmed at another Surrey farm, near the site of the first outbreak.
On Tuesday [7 Aug 2007], a DEFRA [Department of the Environment, Food, and
Rural Affairs] spokesman said laboratory results had confirmed an outbreak
at the 2nd site.
Environment secretary Hilary Benn said vets had spotted the signs on
Monday, and a swift decision was taken to cull the animals. He urged
farmers to continue to examine their stock. DEFRA said 102 cattle had been
culled at the site, inside the 3 km [1.8 mile] protection zone around the
farm where the virus was confirmed on Friday [3 Aug 2007]. Inspectors are
due to confirm the source of that outbreak later.
Meanwhile restrictions on movement have been relaxed in Scotland. Animals
will be able to be transported to slaughterhouses under strictly controlled
conditions.
A 3 km (1.8 mile) protection zone and a surveillance zone with a minimum
radius of 10 km (6.2 miles) is in place around the first site.
Farmer Laurence Matthews, who owns the land where the 2nd outbreak struck,
said the farmer whose cattle were culled, and his family, were "absolutely
devastated. We were starting to think that maybe this virus had been
contained... now with this 2nd outbreak this has set us back again," he
told the BBC. "Most farmers... are very, very scared and all activity on
farms has almost come to a standstill."
The government says no decision has been taken on whether to vaccinate
livestock, but 300 000 doses have been ordered from Merial -- to ensure it
is ready if needed.
The National Farmers' Union, which has opposed the use of vaccination in
the past, said the government should have the capability to use it "as an
option," depending on the circumstances. NFU head of communications Anthony
Gibson praised the response so far, saying: "I think that everything that
could have been done, has been done. I think the lessons, so far, have been
learned from what went wrong in the 2001 outbreak."
The government had banned the movement of all livestock across Britain --
although some restrictions have now been relaxed in Scotland.
The European Commission has formalised a ban on British exports of meat,
milk products and live animals. Northern Ireland, which has imposed a ban
on all cattle, sheep and pigs from Britain, has been excluded.
Sir Donald Curry, who headed an inquiry into the future of farming after
the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak, said it was too early to lift the
restrictions but it would soon be clear whether the "very virulent" disease
had spread. He added: "Provided the disease hasn't spread then within a few
more days, government can consider relaxing other parts of the United
Kingdom from the restrictions but we do have to be very certain." He said
that if livestock restrictions remained in place for weeks, "for many
farming businesses this could be crippling".
There has been some criticism from some farmers, the Lib Dems and the
Conservatives that footpaths inside the 3 km [1.8 mile] protection zone
have not been closed. [see item 2]. The government has said footpaths are
closed on the infected premises, but others inside the zone remained open
as veterinary risk assessments had shown the risk was negligible. Defra
said the countryside "remains open" to visitors.
The NFU has estimated the outbreak could cost "tens of millions of pounds,"
affecting not just farmers but related industries, such as abattoirs and
meat packaging plants.

[We are grateful to Joe Dudley for the following comment: "DEFRA continues
to refer to the first 2 reported infected herds as a single 'outbreak,'
despite the fact that there were 2 different herds, on 2 different farm
properties involved; although both properties [in Normandy and in Elstead]
were owned by the same individual".
The new outbreak confirmed today (7 Aug 2007), which is in fact the 3rd
outbreak, is on a property owned by another individual. It lies between the
index farm and the Pirbright labs property.
A total of 199 heads of cattle have been culled as of 7 Aug 2007: 97 cattle
were culled from the first 2 outbreaks (64 from the infected premises, 33
from neighbouring premises); 102 were culled in the 3rd outbreak.
The production of vaccine by the Merial laboratory will, probably (details
will be apperciated), not involve handling of live virus but the dilution
and bottling of an inactivated, highly concentrated antigen which has been
produced in the past and kept frozen in a "vaccine bank." - Mod.AS]

[2] Local precautionary measures
Date: Tue 7 Aug 2007

<http://www.woking.co.uk/news/woking/2013/2013553/restrictions_announced>

Woking Borough Council has announced restrictions on public access to sites
in the DEFRA protection zone where there are cattle grazing. It means that
Smart's Heath and Prey Heath in Mayford and Sheet's Heath in Brookwood will
be closed to the public for the forseeable future.
The move follows the confirmation of a 2nd [see comment above] case of FMD
at a farm close to the site of the 1st outbreak in Normandy. Defra said 102
cattle were culled last night [6 Aug 2007]. Normandy is in the neighbouring
borough of Guildford.
A spokesman for Woking council said the restrictions are being imposed
following discussions with Surrey County Council and The Heathland Project.
"This is a precautionary measure only and is not in response to an official
order by Defra," said the spokesman.
Advisory notices are being placed at entrances to the sites asking the
public not to enter, to keep dogs on leads and not to approach cattle.
Pedestrian gates are also being secured with cable ties and disinfected
straw mats are being provided at key points as an additional measure. The
scene outside the farm in Normandy where the 2nd outbreak of FMD has been
confirmed and the cattle culled.
Last week [30 Jul - 3 Aug 2007] the News and Mail reported how the cattle
had been moved on to the sites for the summer to help maintain the
heathland. They have been loaned to the council by a Guildford farmer and
are due to be returned next month.
In terms of refuse collections, Woking Borough Council says it is still
planning a normal service from all properties in the borough. "There are a
limited number of farms due for collection later in the week and the
council will continue to get up-to-date advice on whether to proceed with
collections from these sites," said the spokesman.

[The above information from a local daily newspaper illustrates the
hardships, complications, and technical problems the rural population has
to endure these days in the affected area. Voluntary closure of footpaths
reflects the strong demand of farmers to impose restrictions upon the
movement of passengers and visitors in and near the premises where
susceptible livestock is maintained. Farmers are familiar with the extreme
infectivity of the FMD virus, which can be carried on footwear, clothing
etc. - Mod.AS]

[3] Interim report of expert investigation at Pirbright

Outbreak source 'linked to labs'
--------------------------------
The Health and Safety Executive's interim report confirmed the strain [of
foot and mouth disease] found on Woolford farm, near Guildford in Surrey on
Friday [3 Aug 2007], was the same as that being worked on at the nearby
Pirbright site. There is a "strong probability" the FMD outbreak began at a
research site, inspectors have said.
Either the private company Merial, or the state-run Institute for Animal
Health, both based at the Pirbright site, could be the source, they said. A
Health and Safety Executive report found no evidence of airborne
transmission but said it could have been the result of human movement.
"Accidental or deliberate transfer" is being investigated as a possibility.
The National Farmers' Union has said there is "incredulity and shock" that
a research facility that works to protect against disease, could have been
the source of the outbreak. Vaccine manufacturer Merial was involved in
"large scale production" of the strain -- about 10 000 litres [2641.7
gallons] -- while the Institute was carrying out "small scale" experiments,
it said.
The report said there was no evidence that working practices, or any spills
or leaks from equipment were to blame. There was a "negligible" risk that
it was carried on the wind or through water, caused by flooding. But there
were "various potential routes for accidental or deliberate transfer of
material from the site" and various lines of inquiry were being pursued.
"Release by human movement must also be considered a real possibility," the
report said. "Further investigation of the above issues is required and is
being urgently pursued."
Prime minister Gordon Brown said he was "hopeful" a second report would be
published on Wednesday [8 Aug 2007]. "We will continue these investigations
so we get an isolation of the disease itself, and an isolation of the cause
of the disease," he said.

[At this stage it is not known which of the 2 facilities was the emitter of
the virus. One fact is clear: the amount of the virus on the vaccine
production facility was significantly bigger than in the
research/diagnostic laboratory. However, if human interference was
involved, the quantity is of less significance. We'll have to wait
patiently, hoping for a clear-cut outcome -- which is not guaranteed. - Mod.AS]
