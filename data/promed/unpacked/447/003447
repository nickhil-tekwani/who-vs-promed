Nebraska officials investigate apparent poisoning of 250 cattle on ranch
---------------------------------
The carcasses of 250 cattle were found dead of apparent poisoning on
a ranch in northeast Nebraska, authorities said.
The state patrol was investigating the deaths north of Richland with
the Colfax County Sheriff's office, the State Department of
Agriculture, and the University of Nebraska.
"We don't really know whether it's accidental or intentional yet,"
said Terri Teuber, a spokeswoman for the state patrol.
The cattle were yearlings owned by Jack Barta of Fremont, who said he
received word of the deaths Sunday morning.
Organophosphate may have poisoned the cattle, because about 30 that
survived were responding to a drug [probably atropine - Mod.TG] used
to combat nerve gas in soldiers, Barta said. The chemical [the
organophosphate] is commonly used as an insecticide.
The chemical could have come in a sack of mislabeled minerals or
someone may have intentionally put it in the cattle's feed, Barta
said.
