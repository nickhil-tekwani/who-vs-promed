Arua district has had the highest number of anthrax in humans, with a total number of 102 reported between 2015 to date [Mon 12 Nov 2018]. Over 200 people have been infected with anthrax in 4 districts in West Nile and South Western Uganda. According to the Ministry of Health officials, many people were at risk of contracting the disease which is common in animals. The 236 cases have been recorded in the districts of Arua, Kiruhura, Isingiro and Kween from 2017 up to today [Mon 12 Nov 2018].

Speaking during the 4th National Field Epidemiology Conference on [Fri 9 Nov 2018] at Imperial Royale hotel, Dr Alex Ario, the acting director, Uganda National Institute of Public Health Ministry of Health called on the public to ensure animal health if the country is to control anthrax.

Arua district has had the highest number of anthrax in humans with a total number of 102 reported between 2015 to date [Mon 12 Nov 2018]. Isingiro district came 2nd with 60 cases reported last year [2017], 52 cases in Kween district and 22 in Kiruhura were registered this year [2018]. [...]

Ario said if government does not address the problem of anthrax from animal side, it will continue to spread and affect more people. He however noted with concern that some farmers cannot afford the cost to vaccinate their animals against anthrax. He urged the government to come up with a policy on vaccination of animals. "In some cultures however, instead of getting rid of animals which have died from anthrax, these animals are eaten by people," he noted. It is against this background that Ario called for a need to put in place a policy to burn the animal once it is found to have died of anthrax.

Dr Willy Nguma, the Arua district veterinary officer said at the moment at least 150 000 animals including cows, sheep, goats and pigs are at risk of anthrax. He said the outbreak from 2017 to 2018 left over 1000 [animals] dead. Nguma said sudden death is one of the signs of anthrax in animals. He said that Arua needs only sh 3m [USD 810] to vaccinate animals that are at risk of getting the disease. "The disease can only be controlled if we can vaccinate all animals which are likely to get the disease," he said.

[With thanks to Kunihiko for forwarding this report from Uganda, which is matched almost word for word for another out of Kampala. It is a significant problem. The Ugandan government needs to come up with an effective control programme and not to depend on the livestock owners finding money they don't have to cover the vaccination costs. When vaccination and control are done properly, it results not just in the reduced incidence but in the eradication of this disease. The spores are not immortal and if soil recontamination is prevented by effective carcass burning and site management, one will see long term benefits within 5-8 years.

This is why livestock anthrax has disappeared from a number of countries which were once chronically afflicted, starting with Cyprus in 1969, but now the Czech Republic, Finland, Latvia & Estonia, Denmark, Belgium, Austria, Ireland and the UK, Netherlands, Switzerland, to select but a few successful European countries. Though in the middle of a region favorable for spore survival; North & South Dakota have eradication on their horizon, as does Argentina, thanks to pursuing proactive livestock vaccination, plus control & surveillance.
