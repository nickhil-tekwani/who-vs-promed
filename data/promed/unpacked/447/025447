Thailand: additional suspected human case of avian influenza in the north
--------------------------------------------------
There were 24 suspected bird flu cases in Thailand in the 2nd half of 2004,
according to the government Avian Influenza Operations Centre. 11 of these
cases were in the south, 7 in the north, 4 in the north east, and 2 in the
central region.
All patients were under medical supervision, while the results of
laboratory tests were pending. Since the country was hit by a 2nd outbreak
of avian influenza in mid 2004, Thailand has recorded 5 confirmed cases of
avian influenza. 4 of them died, while the last patient recovered,
according to the centre.
There is another suspected [human?] bird-flu case in the country's northern
province of Kamphaeng Phet.
More than 1200 locations in 57 provinces have been identified as suspected
epidemic areas, where fowls have been culled. The government has drafted a
strategy to eliminate all human cases of bird-flu patients within the next
3 years.

[The figures published by the Avian Influenza Operations Centre in Thailand
differ from those given by the World Health Organization. The Avian
Influenza Operations Centre states that a total of 24 + 1 suspected cases
of avian influenza have occurred in Thailand during the 2nd half of 2004,
whereas the cumulative number of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus confirmed
in Thailand since 28 Jan 2004 is still given as 17 by WHO
(<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2004_10_25/en/>).
Further clarification of the status of the suspected cases would be
welcomed. - Mod.CP]
