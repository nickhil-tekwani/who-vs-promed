I was musing zoonoses and interspecies transmisiion of infectious agents, it
occured to me to wonder if anyone has examined beef and pork insulin for
evidence of transmissible agents like BSE ?

I'm slow to get back to you -- too many things going on.
On the one hand, pancreas is probably not in the same league as pituitary in
terms of intrinisic starting TSE titre. Also, insulin is a small soluble
peptide that they are hopefully crystallizing to get to pharmaceutical grade.
On the other hand, it has always been a mystery to me how they could purify
gonadotrophin and growth hormone to some reasonable state and still have
enough insoluble CJD titre to infect someone through ordinary injection.
Pooled products are evidently very much dangerous than, say, a unit from a
single individual. With pigs and cattle, there is an opportunity for the
double whammy of pre-amplification and then pooling. I wouldn't be surprised
if every batch of 10,000 included a pituitary from someone with incipient
CJD. It doesn't particularly help to screen out people or animals with
symptoms if they are just the tip of the iceberg. I don't see a solution
until there is a very sensitive assay.

Subject: growth hormone: a test for quantitating cjd transmission?
I came across a couple of interesting items reading the thoughtful review of
Ridley and Baker, Dec 96 J.Gen Virology 77 2895-2904 (no online presence):
pg 2896: 75 cases of CJD so far from intra-muscular injection to short
children of cadaver-derived pooled human pituitaries. 2.5% of recipients in
France [34 infected, 974 received contaminated batch], mean incubation of 8
years; 1% British, mean incubation 12 years; 0.2% Americans, mean incubation
18 years [6284 recipients, 7 infected from 700 before 1970]. [I have spliced
in some data from abstracts.]
"This suggests that incubation periods are related to dose of infectivity.
The difference in incubation period between countries would be compatible
with ech manufacturing method producing a different but uniiform degeee of
contamination throughout the growth hormone product." [based on P. Brown J
Neural Transm Suppl 47: 219-229 (1996) --- not online, abstract meager]
Now it seems to me that we are caught between a rock and a hard place by
these data:
Suppose that 1 pituitary in a batch of 10,000 had CJD [assume one per
million per year incidence, allow for older age of cadavers, and infectious
but asymptomatic cases].
Suppose further that a 1000 fold purification of growth hormone relative to
infectious prion is obtained. I would actually expect better than this with
the methods of the 1960's [Sephadex columns, SDS, ultra-centrafuges, etc]
given the disparity in chemical properties of the two proteins [polarity,
molecular weight, hydrophobicity: run the HGH sequence yourself, given
below, at SwissTools http://expasy.hcuge.ch/cgi-bin/protscale.pl].
While there is a major tradeoff between final purity and yield, it's hard to
believe some crude homogenate would be injected given all the other hormones
in pituitaries. Just a centrifuge step would give a huge purification. We're
not talking here about 1000 fold relative to all initial protein, but
relative to a particular one with seemingly highly unfavorable properties
for copurification.
The pre-1970 US patients had 41 months of injections -- I don't know how
many pituitary-equivalents this works out to. The French codon 129
heterozygotes have not been affected at this point in time.
This brings us to a 10,000,000 to 1 dilution injected intra-muscularly with
rather rapid onset in what may turn out to be a rather high percentage of
participants. Somehow it was still a whopping dose. Transfer by surgical
instrument is undiluted and delivered cerebrally -- yet how many picograms
of rogue prion are left after cleaning? I don't represent the HGH
calculation to be more than a back of the envelope estimate and I could have
overlooked some factors or made an error.
But I am left thinking that either we are way off on the incidence of CJD,
or way off on how many rogue prion molecules it takes to constitute a lethal
inoculum, or way off on the susceptibility of young people, or some mix of
these. I don't find the implictions for blood transfusion very reassuring
either, especially pooled products.
If some portion of these batches are still around, it might be very valuable
to assay their titre with modern methods, see how contaminated they really
were and what sort of cumulative dose was delivered. Anybody know?

Subject: Re: growth hormone: a test for quantitating cjd transmission?
With respect to the children and the pituitary hormone injections:
[Pardon all the numbered points: I know it seems pedantic, but it helps me
organize my thoughts.]
1. The situation is somewhat similar to hemophiliacs and blood transfusions.
The pituitary extracts are pooled across hosts, with a possibly large number
of hosts involved (100+). This greatly multiplies the chances of an
infectious agent by a similar factor. Couple this to 40+ months of
injections (how many times per month?) with each injection coming from
possibly a different batch of hormone, and the combined exposure factor
reaches 4,000+ times more.
2. People seem to be making the presumption the dose is cumulative. This may
not be true. It may be a simple situation of "Russian roulette". The more
exposures, the greater chance of the right combination of circumstances
resulting in infection.
3. The differences between countries may relate simply to the size of dose,
the number of doses or the degree of pooling in different countries.
4. Your centrifugation argument could be taken as support for an infectious
agent other than a prion protein.
5. Don't forget surgical instruments are heavily sterilized. Consequently
any agent present would be at least partially deactivated.
6. Pituitaries of older people may be more infectious than is first
apparent. The aging process (time) would amplify any infectious agent beyond
initial exposure. Even though asymptomatic, tissues of elderly people may be
much more dangerous.
I agree with Tom that the pattern of data is starting to indicate a
reservoir in the population which is much larger than would seem apparent
from the number of actual cases, and the agent is extremely virulent.
What do we know for sure?
1. The disease occurs widely at 0.5-1.5 / 1,000,000 population PER YEAR.
These natural cases are diagnosed in people 50+, so the rate per LIFETIME
would be increased by the 50 -> 75 yr period to 12.5-37.5/1,000,000
population PER LIFETIME.
2. ALL forms of CJD are EXTREMELY infectious (very low dose, with very high
certainty). Otherwise there would be no iatrogenic cases from surgical
instruments.
3. The infectious agent is EXTREMELY difficult to deactivate, judging again
by the sterilization of surgical instruments and the BSE-rendering experience.
4. The disease has an apparently long incubation period, 50+ yrs in the
sporadic CJD, 8-12 years in the pituitary injections, 6+ yrs in cattle, etc.
Suppose the following simple model:
1. The disease starts immediately with the initial infectious dose.
2. The progression of the disease is proportional to the amount of
infectious agent present, initially minute. [This is a strong argument for
the prion hypothesis vs. the virino hypothesis.]
3. The conversion of tissue to the infected form would most simply take a
first-order rate process form of
dI / dt = + k I I = amount of infected material
4. This would result in a curve of the form
I = Io exp { + k t } Io = initial infectious dose
5. Consequently the amount of infection would be proportional to initial
dose and exponential with time. The reported "incubation periods" would be
simply the time to I > Threshold to symptomatic conditions. Therefore the
"incubation period" should be considered more like a "half-life".
6. This simple model presupposes the body has no defense against the
infection. If it does, then the rate equation could be modified to
dI / dt = + k1 I - J where J = body disinfection rate
This would primarily have the effect of increasing the half-life and,
depending on the model for "J", shallowing the initial growth.
If a model of this type is valid, then:
1. A significant part of the human or animal population could be infected,
although asymptomatic as yet.
2. The sporadic rate may indicate the spontaneous generation of an
infectious agent over time (e.g., prion agent through defective aging, like
cancer generation).
3. ALL older animals should be considered more dangerous than young animals.
All things considered,
1. I believe hemophiliacs may have a slight problem with CJD and blood
transfusions. However, older people (50+) are probably not the largest
blood-donors. And what else can a hemophiliac do? And if a person is
asymptomatic, how do you screen the blood supply, absent a sensitive
biochemical test?
2. There may very well be a larger "carrier" reservoir out there amongst the
human and animal populations. However the risks associated with this seem to
be limited at present to certain rare and promiscuous populations (hormone
injections, hemophiliacs). It certainly bears watching.
3. We REALLY need a sensitive test for the infectious agents of TSEs before
we can do anything more productive.
4. Does anyone have any information about the infection rate in morticians
and medical-examiners? Since they both remove brains (with saws), they may
have an enhanced rate. Particularly morticians who are not infrequently
splattered with blood and other body tissues.

Subject: pituitary gonadotrophin CJD epidemic in Australia
There is an active CJD Support Group Network in Australia that deals with
their very tragic and gratuitous epidemic. HPG from pituitaries was used to
treat infertility in women in addition to HGH on short children. In some
ways, they are at a point right now that England might be in in a few years.
I have reprinted portions of their Web site below -- it is well worth an
extended visit for a glimpse of the human side of this disease and the issue
of accountability.
Tom
-----------------------------
http://www.hyper.net.au/cjdsupport/
This is the home page of the Australian CJD Support Group Network Inc (CJDSGNI).
Two thousand one hundred Australians were treated with human pituitary
hormones under the Australian Human Pituitary Hormone Program (AHPHP) which
ran in Australia from 1967 until 1985.
Unlike similar programs undertaken in a number of overseas countries at
around the same time, the AHPHP concentrated on the treatment of infertile
women with human pituitary gonadotrophin (hPG) with around six hundred
children treated with human growth hormone (hGH) for stunted growth.
Five Australians so far have developed and died from iatrogenic
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) as a result of receiving pituitary hormone
products. The program was suspended in 1985 following hGH related CJD deaths
in the United States. All those treated under the program are at risk of
developing CJD, because the manufacturing protocols allowed cross-infection
of production batches.
The AHPHP was run under the auspices of the Commonwealth Department of
Health. The hormones were manufactured by the then government owned
Commonwealth Serum Laboratory in Melbourne. The AHPHP was conceived and
operated by the Human Pituitary Advisory
Committee (HPAC) until its activities ceased in 1985. The committee was
finally disbanded.
Intense media and politically pressure followed as the families of the
victims called for an explanation. There was growing evidence of a cover up.
The then Minister for Health, Senator Graham Richardson, ordered an
Independent Inquiry into the use of human pituitary hormones and CJD.
Professor Margaret Allars conducted the Inquiry for over 12 months reporting
in June 1994. The Inquiry made a number of recommendations concerning the
care of recipients, future medical ethical behaviour and the establishment
of a ministerial advisory council.
The Inquiry also found that HPAC had seriously breached both Federal and
State laws, it breached its own guidelines and engaged in human
experimentation. The report was damning. Commentators described the program
as the worst case of medical negligence in Australia's history. It was not
in the Inquiry's terms of reference to draw conclusions regarding issues of
professional or criminal misconduct and unlawful negligence.
The recipients and their families caught up in this disaster meanwhile have
to live with the stress and anxiety of living the rest of their lives with
the threat of contracting a disease which can lay dormant for decades and
for which there is no recognised diagnostic test, no treatment and certainly
no cure.
