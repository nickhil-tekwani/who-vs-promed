Another child suspected to be suffering from Japanese encephalitis (JE) died in Lucknow on Friday night [11 Sep 2015], bringing the toll to over 50 from Pilibhit district.

All these patients were suspected to be suffering from JE, say medical sources here. According to sources, a critically ill girl, aged 6 from Udaipur village in Amariya, was referred to Lucknow by district hospital doctors on 21 Aug [2015] because she was suspected to be suffering from JE. She received treatment in Lucknow for more than 2 weeks but could not be saved.

Numerous children suspected to be suffering from JE across Bareilly division are reported to have died over the past 2 months, but there are no facilities to either diagnose or treat the disease in Bareilly and its neighbouring districts.

All suspected patients of JE are referred to Lucknow, which is far away [270 km (170 miles)], and precious time is wasted in taking patients to the city. Delay in treatment can prove fatal, say doctors here.

Dr Om Chauhan, chief medical officer, told TOI: "The increasing number of suspected JE deaths is a real worry for us at the moment. We have organized camps in rural areas where more numbers of cases are reported. We have also alerted all hospitals in the district to report all the suspected cases with their medical history. Dr Prashant, district malaria officer, is coordinating in case of all such cases."

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), around 500-600 people die every year in UP because of JE. However, the actual mortality rate in Bareilly division is yet to be confirmed, as no diagnostic lab is available in these districts.

More than 50 people, mostly children, have died over the past 2 months in Pilibhit district. However, no official death is yet registered because all the suspected patients died in private hospitals or outside the district, said medical sources.

[It is curious that no mention is made in the above report of whether there has been a recent vaccination campaign in this district against JE virus, nor specifically whether any of the 50 fatal cases had been vaccinated.

Although Uttar Preddsh is endemic for JE virus, not all encephalitis cases are due to infection by this virus. Other etiologies have been proposed (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150909.3633134). It is unfortunate that the nearest diagnostic laboratory is so far away from the district. Until there are reliable diagnostic laboratory services close at hand, and until the etiology of the non-JE cases is determined, these cases will continue to occur each year.
