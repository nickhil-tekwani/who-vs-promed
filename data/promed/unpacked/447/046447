There are now 67 confirmed cases of measles in an outbreak centered in California, health officials said.

The California Department of Public Health said there are now 59 cases in the state, 42 that have been directly linked to being at Disneyland Park or Disney California Adventure Park in December [2014]. Some people visited Disneyland Park or Disney California Adventure Park while infectious in January [2015].

The 59 patients in California range in age from 7 months to 70 years. The vaccination status is known for 34 of the patients. Of those, 28 were unvaccinated, one had received partial vaccination and 5 were fully vaccinated. Nine counties in California have confirmed measles cases: Alameda, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Mateo, Santa Clara, and Ventura. Cases connected to visiting Disneyland have also been confirmed in Utah (3), Washington state (2), Oregon (1), Colorado (1) and Mexico (1).

Healthcare officials said it is safe to go to Disneyland and other venues with large crowds if you are immunized for measles. "I think it is absolutely safe for you to go to Disneyland if you're vaccinated," said Dr. Gil Chavez, the state epidemiologist. But he cautioned that people who are too young to be immunized -- such as infants less than 6 months of age -- should avoid large crowds where international travelers are concentrated, like theme parks and airports.

[2] USA (California - Disneyland cases)

Several Disneyland workers have been diagnosed with measles. Two of those employees had been vaccinated, according to the Orange County [OC] Health Care Agency. Health officials are still investigating whether the other workers have documentation of measles immunization.

In the measles battle, O.C. barred 24 students lacking proof of shots. Disneyland officials said 5 employees have been diagnosed with measles since Thursday [22 Jan 2015], and all employees who could've been in contact with those 5 have been asked to provide vaccination records or do a blood test that shows they've built immunity to the disease.

Any of those employees who had not been vaccinated or could not confirm their immunity status have been asked to go on paid leave until their status could be confirmed, Disneyland officials said.

Three of the 5 employees have been treated and medically cleared. Park officials have been working closely with health officials and putting their employees on alert.

"As soon as the OC Health Care Agency notified us on 7 Jan 2015, we immediately began to communicate to our cast to raise awareness," Dr. Pamela Hymel, Chief Medical Officer, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, said in a statement. "In an abundance of caution, we also offered vaccinations and immunity tests." Orange County health officials confirmed 2 more measles cases Tuesday [20 Jan 2015], bringing the total number in the county to 18.

Places where measles patients have been: A measles outbreak was traced to people at the theme park who visited between [17 and 20 Dec 2014]. Since then, the highly contagious disease has spread across California, 3 other states and Mexico. The virus has begun infecting people beyond those who visited the theme park and is now in the broader community, officials say. Orange County health officials directed about 2 dozen Huntington Beach High School students who had no proof of measles vaccination to be barred from classes until 29 Jan 2015 after an infected student came to class this month [January 2015]. Students can remain in school by showing a record of vaccination or through a blood test that shows they have immunity to the disease, according to the county Department of Education.

The rapid spread of measles is what experts have feared. Health officials generally hope a measles outbreak can be contained within a manageable group of people and eventually be extinguished by keeping the ill at home or in a hospital room until they recover, with the outbreak eventually being stopped by the broader community of vaccinated people. But with vaccination rates falling off over the last several years, the virus appears to be spreading.

Officials warned the public that a Disneyland visitor may be linked to at least 7 confirmed cases of the measles throughout California and 2 in Utah. Six of the 7 California patients were not vaccinated for measles. Doctors suspected the 1st infected person visited the park sometime between 15-20 Dec 2014.

8 Jan 2015 -- A Utah Department of Health spokeswoman said both cases in their state were not vaccinated. Five Disneyland employees contracted measles.

9 Jan 2015 -- The Orange County Healthcare Agency reported 5 more people who visited Disneyland parks were diagnosed with measles. The number of cases in the state goes up to a dozen.

10 Jan 2015 -- Colorado health officials confirmed one patient was diagnosed with measles at a Colorado Springs hospital after visiting a California theme park. 19 people from 3 states (16 in California, 2 in Utah, and one in Colorado) contracted measles, health officials said.

12 Jan 2015 -- The Long Beach Health Department confirmed one measles case in the city. The California Department of Public Health said 26 people in 4 states have been linked to the Disneyland outbreak.

13 Jan 2015 -- The state health department warned residents of 3 new cases, 2 in San Bernardino County and one in Long Beach. At least 22 cases have been linked to the Disneyland visitor in December 2014.

23 Jan 2015 -- The Ventura County Star, citing bank officials, reports that an employee at a Citibank branch in Camarillo contracted the virus, possibly
infecting others who visited the bank.

16 Jan 2015 -- 7 new cases in San Diego were linked to the Disneyland outbreak. Two of 6 infected siblings had visited the park.

17 Jan 2015 -- Health officials reported at least 51 measles cases have been diagnosed since the December 2014 outbreak. All but 9 were connected to Disney theme parks. 45 of those cases have been in California.

19 Jan 2015 -- Sharp Rees-Stealy Rancho Bernardo Urgent Care is closed as a result of a suspected case of measles.

20 Jan 2015 -- After the Department of Health confirmed a student with measles was at Huntington Beach High School sometime between 6-8 Jan 2015, administrators told 23 unvaccinated students to stay home for 21 days, the incubation period for measles.

21 Jan 2015 -- Orange County confirmed 2 new cases of measles, raising its total to 20. Disney said it will consider refund requests on a "case-by-case" basis. San Diego County has 3 new cases, a total of 13.

California health officials say California has now 59 cases of measles this year [2015], 42 of which are related to an initial exposure at Disneyland. Five Disneyland employees are diagnosed with measles. The Orange County Healthcare Agency said there is still "ongoing measles transmission at Disneyland."

The Maricopa County Department of Public Health has confirmed that a woman has tested positive for measles after visiting the Disneyland theme park in California last month [December 2014].

She has recovered from the virus, and officials say she had little exposure to Maricopa County residents.

"Mitigating factors allowed this person to go unreported for a few weeks. Luckily, we were able to quickly identify the small group of individuals that may have been exposed," said Dr. Bob England, director of Maricopa County Department of Public Health.

"However, we are not out of the woods yet," added England. "California is only a state away, and there may be more secondary cases in Maricopa County. This is why we need residents and our healthcare community to be vigilant in identifying measles' signs and symptoms."

Per the department's news release, "Measles is a vaccine-preventable viral illness that is the most contagious disease on earth. It can easily spread through the air by coughing and sneezing. In fact, the measles virus can survive in the air for hours and may be transmitted even after an infected individual is no longer in the room/area."

Symptoms:

Typically appear 7-12 days after exposure to measles but may take up to 21 days

Begin with fever (101 F [38 C] or higher), red, watery eyes, cough and runny nose

Followed by a rash that is red, raised, and blotchy. The rash begins on the face at the hairline and moves down the body. The rash may last for 5-6 days and may turn brownish.

What to do if you think you have measles:

If you have a healthcare provider, contact him/her by phone and let them know that you may have been exposed to measles. They will let you know when to visit their office so as not to expose others in the waiting area.

If you do not have a health care provider, you may need to be seen at your local hospital emergency room/urgent care center. Please call before going to let them know you may have measles.

An individual who recently spent time in Omaha and Blair has been diagnosed with a confirmed case of measles. The individual was at 4 public locations in the past week, and health officials say people who are not immune to measles through either vaccination or history of illness could become infected if they were exposed.

The locations included:
- Country Bible Church near Blair on Sun 11 Jan 2015 from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.
- Costco at 12 300 West Dodge Road on Mon 12 Jan 2015 from 6:30-9:30 p.m.
- Omaha Children's Museum on Thu 15 Jan 2015 from 12 noon-5:30 p.m.
- Blair Dance Center on Thu 15 Jan 2015 from 4:00-7:00 p.m.

If a person was at any of the locations listed above during the dates and times indicated and develops symptoms of measles, they should call their healthcare provider right away.

Symptoms of measles generally begin within 7-14 days after exposure and last about 10 days. A typical case begins with fever, cough, runny nose, red watery eyes and a sore throat. The window of time given by health officials includes 2 hours that the virus is airborne; after that, the virus is no longer contagious, according to health officials.

"We're in the worst period of outbreak in 30 years; we had over 600 cases in the United States last year [2014], which was the worst it's been," said Dr. Angela Sukstorf with Fremont Health. Dr. Sukstorf attributes the spread to travel.

A student at Valley High School was confirmed to have measles this week, Clark County School District officials said today [23 Jan 2015]. It's the 1st confirmed case in Southern Nevada since 2011, according to the Southern Nevada Health District.

The Clark County School District said it had identified 36 students at Valley High who had not received the latest immunizations for measles. They were removed from class on Thu 22 Jan 2015 and won't be back in school until 3 Feb 2015, officials said.

The student with the disease is back in school and is past the period during which the disease is infectious, said Lynn Row, the School District's director of health services. Letters and fact sheets about the measles were sent home with students, but school officials are expecting to field a lot of phone calls from concerned parents, Row said. "At this point, we just want to get them the facts," she said.

Ohio is dealing with a massive measles outbreak as cases around the country have also skyrocketed.

According to the Centers for Disease Control, there were 644 measles cases reported in 2014 in more than half of all U.S. states, including right here in Ohio. That's the largest number of cases since the CDC started collecting measles elimination data in 2000.

The CDC reports the majority of people who contracted measles were not vaccinated. The Center said commonly, travelers bring the disease to the states. According to the Ohio Department of Health's website, it's now investigating an outbreak of cases here in Ohio. The department reports the total number of cases at 382 with 9 hospitalizations. The cases range from those who are younger than 6 months to some who are 53 years old.

Knox County is reporting the most cases in Ohio with 195 people infected. To prevent the spread, the Ohio Department of Health and local health departments are encouraging people to get the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. It says in almost all cases, people who received the MMR vaccine are protected.

First case of measles in Lane County since 2007 tied to Disneyland Cluster
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lane County Public Health officials today confirmed a case of measles in Lane County that's believed to be linked epidemiologically to the so-called ­Disneyland Cluster in Southern ­California. It's the 1st reported case of measles in Lane County since 2007. The local case involves a man in his 40s who lives and works in Eugene, county public health spokesman Jason Davis said. His workplace has been alerted, Davis said.

The man visited Disneyland with his wife and family in December [2014], which is when the outbreak is believed to have originated, Davis said. The man still is checking health records to learn whether he was ever vaccinated for ­measles, Davis said. "Measles is a huge deal," Davis said. "In terms of communicability, how readily a disease is transferred, on a scale of 1 to 10, this would be a 11." Davis said that, on average, one case of influenza results in 2 new cases. Measles, by contrast, typically produces 16 to 18 new cases for each confirmed case.

The measles outbreak linked to Disneyland has nearly doubled in size since last week, with 45 reported cases in California and 7 more illnesses confirmed in at least 3 other states and Mexico, health officials told NBC News on Monday [19 Jan 2015]. The Lane County case now makes Oregon at least the 4th state outside of California believed to have at least one case of measles linked to the Disneyland Cluster -- following previous reports in Utah, Colorado and Washington.

The initial "outbreak exposure period" has been pegged from [17 to 20 Dec 2014] at Disneyland, California health officials have said. Among the confirmed cases to date, at least 36 people have been linked epidemiologically to spending all or parts of those same days at the Anaheim resort, records show. Mexican officials have confirmed one measles case in a 22-month-old, unvaccinated girl who visited the theme park [16-18 Dec 2014]. In Utah, there are 3 cases. Washington has 2 cases, and Colorado has one. Those numbers are expected to rise.

Nationally, 539 cases of measles have been confirmed thus far in the 2014-15 season, compared with about 40 to 100 cases in a typical year, Davis said. Locally, Davis noted that immunization rates in Oregon and California are falling. "As that happens, we'll see more of these cases," he said. Among rates of parents who seek exemptions to vaccination, "Oregon's is the worst in the nation," Davis said. "That's something we're concerned about and are trying to do some outreach about."

A Tarrant County resident has tested positive for measles after returning home from a trip to India, the county said Tuesday [20 Jan 2015].

Officials with Tarrant County Public Health confirmed that the resident arrived at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport on 6 Jan 2015. They did not provide details about the patient or say where in the county the person lives. While the county health department will investigate who else might have been exposed in Tarrant County, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will determine whether any other passengers on the international flight were infected. The investigation has turned up nothing so far. The patient's infectious period ended on 7 Jan 2015.

Measles is an airborne disease spread by coughing and sneezing. It causes a reddish rash, high fever, cough, runny nose and watery eyes. Adults who have received the vaccination are considered immune. Last year [2014], the number of confirmed cases of measles in the U.S. hit a 20-year high. Officials blamed unvaccinated Americans and foreign visitors and travelers carrying the disease back from abroad.

An outbreak of measles associated with an international dog show in Slovenia, November 2014. By M Grgic-Vitek, T Frelih1, V Ucakar, M Fafangel, O Jordan Markocic4, K Prosenc, A Kraigher.

Abstract
------
In Slovenia, where measles virus had not been circulating for many years, an outbreak of measles among visitors to an international dog show occurred in November 2014. We identified 23 measles cases plus 21 presumable secondary and tertiary cases. 39 cases were adults, 27 to 56 years old, 12 of them vaccinated with 2 doses. Five were unvaccinated children. Thanks to high vaccination coverage (95.3 percent in birth cohort 2011), wider transmission is not expected in Slovenia.

Discussion
-----
Thanks to early introduction of measles vaccination into the Slovenian vaccination program in 1968 (live measles vaccine prepared from a further-attenuated Edmonston-Zagreb strain was used, replaced by a combined vaccine against measles and mumps in 1979, and from 1990 by trivalent vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella), and to high vaccination coverage in past decades (from 93.9 percent to 96.1 percent for birth cohorts 2003 to 2012), Slovenia has been measles-free for many years. No cases were reported from 2000 to 2009.

In 2010, a cluster of measles was described in a hospital setting. In 2011, 22 cases of measles were reported, 6 of whom were imported (from France, Germany, Italy and Romania), with a few single secondary cases, except in one situation that led to 9 secondary cases. In 2012, 2 imported cases (from Cuba and Germany) were reported, whereas in 2013 only one imported case (from London) was reported, with no secondary cases. Before November 2014, 2 cases imported from Bosnia and Herzegovina were reported in April and July [2014?].

This measles outbreak originating in a mass gathering event was the largest in Slovenia after the major outbreak that started in 1994 and peaked in 1995, with a total of 405 cases notified. In contrast to most outbreaks in other European countries, where the majority of cases are seen in unvaccinated children, most cases in the reported outbreak were adults 34 to 51 years of age (birth cohorts 1963 to 1979). These birth cohorts were also the most affected among the cases reported in Slovenia in 2011 (among 22 notified cases, 18 were 31 to 48 years-old, i.e. in birth cohorts 1963 to 1980). In addition, the serosurveys conducted in Slovenia in the years 1998 and 2000 showed that the same birth cohorts had the highest proportion of measles-seronegative individuals.

Nearly half of the cases (n=21) had been vaccinated with one (n=9) or 2 (n=12) doses of measles-containing vaccine, most of them more than 30 years ago. In an outbreak situation, a substantial proportion of vaccinated cases can usually be expected in a population with very high vaccine coverage.

Five cases fulfilled the clinical criteria, had epidemiological links to the dog show, and measles IgG antibodies higher than 5000 mIU/ml, but negative IgM results and a negative PCR. In these patients, the course of disease was mild. In our experience, such high IgG values are never observed more than 3 years after vaccination (3 of the 5 cases were vaccinated with 2 doses more than 30 years ago), so we considered this too high to be attributed to former immunisation. Presumably, IgG antibodies higher than 5000 mIU/ml indicate a strong secondary immune response, where the presence of IgM antibodies in the serum and the presence of virus in a throat swab or urine are very short and difficult to detect. The ability to detect IgM and viral RNA in vaccinated cases depends on the individual immune response and the timing of the serum sample collection [9].

As pointed out by some authors, with improved measles control over time (high coverage) and in the absence of circulating virus, boosting by exposure to wild type virus becomes rare, and the rate of non-classical infection (mild measles) is likely to increase.

Conclusion
-------
Although 2 incubation periods have not yet passed since the last case, further widespread transmission is not expected due to high vaccination coverage in Slovenia. As the majority of measles cases occurred in birth cohorts 1963 to 1979, and a 3rd of them were fully vaccinated, it remains necessary to closely follow any measles breakthrough cases and conduct a sero-epidemiological study to assess the proportion of susceptibles in these cohorts. This would inform a discussion on the need for an additional (3rd) dose of measles vaccine in these birth cohorts in Slovenia.
