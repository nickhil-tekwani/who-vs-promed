1. The Philippines:
Since the Department of Agriculture (DA) confirmed the 1st ASF outbreak started in July 2019, ASF have been confirmed on Luzon and Mindanao Islands. On Luzon Island, according to the government news agency quoting the Samahan ng Industriya at Agrikultura (SINAG) chairman Rosendo So, some 380 000 heads of pigs have been lost monthly due to the ASF. On Mindanao Island, in addition to Davao area where ASF outbreaks were previously confirmed, the disease was also confirmed in villages in North Cotabato province. According to the DA, the Provincial Veterinary Office of North Cotabato received reports on 29 Jun 2020 of swine mortalities in backyard farms in Barangay Ilian. A disease investigation was conducted on 1 Jul [2020]; the samples tested positive for ASF viral DNA by the DA Regional Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory 12 (RADDL) [https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1108886].

2. Indonesia:
Since the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) confirmed an ASF outbreak in Indonesia [start of event 4 Sep 2019, lab confirmation 27 Nov 2019, OIE notification 17 Dec 2019], as of 6 Mar 2020 the number of ASF-infected areas in North Sumatra province reached 21 districts / cities. Media quoted that the director of Animal Health Services said the COVID-19 pandemic did not preclude the MoA's efforts on ASF; during the pandemic, the MoA was monitoring and coordinating the implementation of ASF control through online meetings. According to a media report referring to iSIKHNAS (animal disease database) data, 16 060 and 2060 swine deaths were reported in May and June [2020], respectively, on Nias Island, North Sumatra province [https://tinyurl.com/y2lgo2a5].

ASF outbreaks have also been suspected in South Sumatra province, according to a media report; a total of 878 pigs died within 2 months in Palembang, and a sample was sent to Lampung Veterinary Center for testing. The Lampung Veterinary Research Center detected ASF virus in one out of 7 samples of pork sold in a number of markets in Palembang, South Sumatra province [https://tinyurl.com/y4zqkgk8]. In East Nusa Tenggara (NTT) province, according to media report, the Animal Husbandry Agency acting head reported that from the beginning of January to June [2020], at least 24 822 pigs had died from the virus across 11 of the province's 21 regencies. The disease has already spread in multiple islands in NTT, including Belu regency (6919), South Central Timor regency (3030), Kupang regency (3338), North Central Timor regency (1496), Malaka regency (731), and Kupang city (249) on Timor Island; Rote Ndao regency (2327) on Rote Island; Sabu Raijua regency (489); West Sumba regency (2679), Southwest Sumba regency (2046), and East Sumba regency (around 2000) on Sumba Island; Alor regency (1186); Sikka regency (332) and Ende regency (469) on Flores Island. The pigs in Sikka tested positive for ASF by the Denpasar Veterinary Center laboratory. On Bali Island, media reported that the Pig Farmers Association has reported similar sudden deaths in pigs across the island on 2 Jul [2020]. This has hit Bali's pig farmers hard as market prices plummet nearly 50% [https://go.kompas.com/read/2020/07/04/002500174/sudden-death-of-over-800-pigs-in-indonesia-sparks-concern?page=all].
