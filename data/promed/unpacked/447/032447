The Mississippi State Department of Health confirmed Monday [31 Mar
2008] that the 1st human case of West Nile virus [infection with
disease] in the state this year [2008] has been reported in Lincoln County.

Details about the patient and other aspects of the case were not
disclosed. Also, the Lincoln County case is only the 2nd human case
reported in the nation for 2008.

"This just means we've got West Nile in that area, and likely it's in
other areas of the state, too," said State Epidemiologist Dr Mary Currier.

Although a March case of West Nile virus is atypical, as the season
for the virus extends from mid-summer through fall, Currier said
cases have been reported as early as January and as late as December.
"It can happen at any time of the year," she said. "Mosquitoes can be
around at any time of the year, and we all need to take precautions."

In 2007, 4 people died as a result of the virus, with 136 total
reported infections. Currier said the number of infections reported
last year [2007], and possibly this year, may be more, since only 20
percent of the people who are infected with West Nile virus actually
display the symptoms. "For every case we have reported, there are at
least 4 others that go unreported," she said.

Those who have battled the virus before need not worry, as having a
West Nile [virus] infection once develops immunity. For everyone
else, Currier stressed taking precautions such as protective
clothing, mosquito repellent and, most importantly, eliminating
mosquito breeding places by removing sources of standing water.

"It's the little puddles more than the big ponds," she said. "We
don't have an increase in West Nile cases around the reservoir every
year -- it doesn't breed mosquitoes."

Currier said mosquitoes breed mostly in smaller sources of still
water, like small ponds and ditches and any overturned container or
crevice that catches water.

"Get rid of those containers," she said. "Places where mosquitoes
breed are usually small puddles that don't move and have a lot of
organic material in them, like old vegetation. It's the little puddle
in the tire swing, in the bird feeder -- that standing water in the ditch."

Currier recommended declaring biological warfare on mosquito breeding
pools with a product called mosquito dunks, which can be purchased at
feed stores.

Mosquito dunks, while in the water, slowly release a biological
mosquito larvaecide composed of the bacteria _Bacillus thuringiensis_
subspecies _israelenses_ (BTI). BTI remains active in the water for
30 days, killing mosquito and black fly larvae before they hatch.

It is recommended to use one mosquito dunk per 100 square feet (9.3
sq m) of water.

"It's an ecologically sound bacterium -- it doesn't hurt frogs, fish,
or other bugs," Currier said. "You just throw them in the water and
they dissipate on their own. You can even throw them down the storm
drain and into sewers."

Currier said mosquito dunks were more effective than using
insecticide to kill adult mosquitoes. "Spraying is not the most
important piece," she said. "Mosquito dunks decrease the mosquito
population before it matures."

Dr Jerome Goddard, the state entomologist, said such larvaecide
programs were the most effective means of combating mosquitoes on a
municipal level. "Cities and counties may elect to start a mosquito
control program," he said. "What we would emphasize here at the
health department is larvaeciding -- killing mosquitoes when they're
still in an immature form, all concentrated in one small place."

Goddard also recommended that municipalities tackle the mosquito
problem with education. "Educational materials can be put out through
various avenues," he said. "You can put them in the water bill and
mail them out so it doesn't cost extra postage. We've seen towns do
that occasionally."

Clean-up days are another important method of combating mosquitoes.
Disposing of artificial mosquito breeding pits like cans and tires is
an important part of limiting mosquito populations and preventing the
spread of West Nile virus.

"Most small towns have a clean-up day every now and then," Goddard
said. "Emphasize the junk along the highway -- artificial containers
like bottles and potato chip bags. Mosquitoes breed in that stuff."

[The recommendation to attack WN virus mosquito vectors where they
breed is sound advice that should be heeded across North America
where _Culex_ mosquitoes breed in those kinds of situations. This is
also good advice for attacking _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes, the vector
of chikungunya, dengue, and urban yellow fever viruses. Public
education and cooperation are essential for success.
