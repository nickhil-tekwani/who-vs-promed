In New Zealand, the causal agent of rust on blueberries was determined by molecular and morphological analyses as _Pucciniastrum minimum_ (_Thekopsora minima_ - EPPO A2 List) rather than _Naohidemyces vacciniorum_ as 1st reported in 2004.

[Blueberry (leaf) rust can be caused by the fungus _Thekopsora minima_ or _Naohidemyces vaccinii_, depending on the region; a 3rd species _N. fujisanensis_ is restricted to Japan. The disease affects a range of plants in the _Ericaceae_ family, including _Vaccinium_ species with crops like blueberry, bilberry and cranberry, as well as ornamentals such as rhododendrons and heathers. Symptoms may include yellow leaf spots on the upper surfaces of young leaves, followed by orange pustules developing on leaf undersides that release the spores. In severe cases or on highly susceptible cultivars, leaves turn brown and drop prematurely, resulting in serious defoliation and potentially death of the plant.

Rust spores are spread by wind over long distances and by splashing rain and mechanical means locally. Infected plant material, including fruit and budwood, poses a high risk of spreading the disease. The rusts can overwinter on evergreen blueberry leaves or alternative hosts in milder climates. Commercial highbush varieties are most susceptible. Disease management for rusts is extremely difficult and relies mainly on timely fungicide applications, choice of crop cultivars, phytosanitation and control of pathogen reservoirs. Crop monitoring for early discovery of infection is important so action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogens as well as build-up of inoculum.

_T. minima_ is also the cause of blueberry rust in Australia (ProMED-mail posts 20150105.3072963 & 20160817.4421210). Movement of fungal spores across the Tasman Sea between NZ and Australia is known to occur, but the incursions in both countries may also be due to separate introductions from outside the region.
