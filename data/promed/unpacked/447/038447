Sanitary Zone IV reported this week trichinosis in pork slaughtered domestically in this city [Bariloche, Rio Negro province] and recommended that people avoid buying pork from informal shops and markets where [the meat may not have been inspected].

Bariloche hospital authorities indicated that to date no human cases have been reported but warned that people who have consumed pork bought in the last 10 days from unauthorized sellers [and probably not inspected for trichinella] and present with symptoms which include swelling of eyelids, intense muscle aches, fever, and occasionally digestive disorders, seek prompt medical attention as treatment during the initial phase of the disease (digestive) is simpler than during the 2nd phase (muscular).


The infected pig, identified by a private veterinarian, was raised in the city and an adult animal, so it is assumed that the disease may have been transmitted to other animals. As part of the Environmental Health department preventive work, buyers of this meet sold informally are being traced.

[Trichinellosis is frequently reported from Argentina. The problem is backyard production of pigs which are sold by private individuals without veterinary inspection. - Mod.EP
