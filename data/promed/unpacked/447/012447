While monsoon season is normally associated with peak disease activity in the state, the recent spell of heavy rains have helped tame the outbreak of Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) or monkey fever in the state, which has claimed 11 lives so far in Wayanad.

With the monsoon season marking the transformation of the disease transmitting _Haemaphysalis spinigera_ nymphs to adult ticks, health authorities say there has been a decrease in the number of new KFD cases being reported over the past 2 weeks.

According to experts, spread of KFD coincides with high nymphal activity of _Haemaphysalis spongiera_ ticks, the main vector of the disease, during the dry season. The disease-causing virus is transmitted to humans by the bites of the _H. spinigera_ nymphs. While the nymphs are highly anthropophilic (preferring humans to other animals), the adult ticks commonly feed on large wild or domesticated animals.

"We have observed a marked decrease in new KFD cases with the onset of monsoon in the district. While there used to be 10-15 new cases reported every week, last week it came down to just 2, which can be attributed to the transformation of _H. spinigera_ nymps to adult ticks, coinciding with the monsoon season. The ticks show a marked proclivity to bite humans during their nymphal stage," said Dr P V Sasidharan, Wayanad district medical officer.

He said that through the seasonal transformation of nymphs into adult ticks has given a respite in the spread of the disease, KFD could resurface again in the next seasonal cycle when the nymphal activity peaks during the months from January to May in the tick life cycle.

The number of people who have so far tested positive for the disease stood at 102 along with 213 suspected cases on Sunday [28 Jun 2015].

"We have prepared an action plan to focus on completing 2 rounds of vaccination for the people identified under the high risk category by December [2015]. Already, 3461 people in the high risk category have received the 1st round of vaccination, and 1300 have been provided the 2nd round of vaccination. Also, we will be conducting controlled burning of bushes along the forest fringes during the months of September and October [2015] to prevent the ticks from coming near the human habitations," the DMO said.

[Transmission of KFD virus to humans and monkeys continues in the Wayanad district of Kerala state. On 11 Mar 2015, 6 human cases were reported in the district, increasing to 9 on 23 Apr 2015 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150312.3225579) and now to 11. Mortality among bonnet macaques has been substantial this year (2015).

Kerala state is endemic for KFD virus, which is being actively transmitted this season [2015]. An 18 Feb 2015 report indicated that human cases there had reached 40 suspected and 18 confirmed infections in just 3 weeks. The disease occurs in humans and monkeys.

Vaccination and avoidance of tick bites are practical preventive measures but require educating local residents of the area about the risk of acquiring the infection and the severity of the disease. Although the virus has been isolated from 16 species of ticks, _Haemaphysalis spinigera_ is the major vector. Most human cases occur during the dry season. KFD virus is a member of the _Flaviviridae_ family. Apparently, a vaccine is available for KFD but needs to be requested from NIB (National Institute of Biologicals) in Pune.
