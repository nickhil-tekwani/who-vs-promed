The Oklahoma salmonellosis outbreak has risen to 15 identified cases
in 3 counties. The state Health Department's investigation also
determined the outbreak may extend into 2 other states. The department
is monitoring the outbreak of a similar strain of _Salmonella_
identified in Iowa and Nebraska, said Laurence Burnsed, the Oklahoma
Health Department's communicable disease division director. Those
states are reporting just a couple of cases, so far.

An additional 2 cases were identified Fri 1 Oct 2010, among
elementary-age children in the Mustang School District in Canadian
County, for a total of 12 cases there. Also previously confirmed were
2 adult cases in Oklahoma County, including one person hospitalized.
Carter County also has a young adult with a confirmed case of
salmonellosis. So far, they have not been able to identify sources or
possible sources of the bacterial disease.

It appears that not all the Oklahoma cases are tied to the school
system. The source could be food that is widely distributed to several
areas of the state, he said, but there's not enough information yet to
suggest a food that people should avoid.

Health Department staffers spent Fri 1 Oct 2010 interviewing ill
adults, parents of ill children, as well as 45 area people who are
well. Comparing activities and foods eaten by both groups helps the
department to piece together a pattern of the illness. But staffers
need to interview more people and evaluate more data. Burnsed said
it's difficult to say how long that will take.
