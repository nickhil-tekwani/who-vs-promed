Yellow fever alert: the outbreak may expand to more provinces
-------------------------------------------------------------
The yellow fever outbreak, which has already caused the death of 2
men in Misiones [province], could expand to [the forested areas in
Salta, Corrientes, Chaco, and Jujuy provinces], according to the
nation's Ministry of Health. "[Laboratory] analysis of samples from
monkeys that died in Corrientes are being done, but there is still no
confirmation that they had yellow fever [virus]," said Hugo
Fernandez, national director of Disease Prevention and Risk of the
national Ministry of Health. "It would not be absurd if the outbreak
turns up in other provinces."

Yesterday [3 Jan 2009], the director of Corrientes Health Zone V,
Marcelo Gimenez, acknowledged the discovery of dead monkeys in his
province, and said that they are carrying out laboratory tests to
confirm the initial diagnosis. The animals were discovered in a farm
next to the urban area of Colonia Liebig, a settlement, which is at
the boundary with Misiones [province].

In order to stop the yellow fever outbreak, health authorities, both
provincial and national, are urging the vaccination of the
population. According to Fernandez, "More than 90 percent of the
people have been vaccinated in Misiones, Corrientes, and Formosa, but
we need to add more to that total. Especially those who travel." The
Misiones minister of health, Jose Guccione, yesterday [3 Jan 2009]
was considering if obligatory yellow fever vaccination should be
implemented there.

Up to the present, there has only been a recommendation for
vaccination for those living in high risk areas: Misiones and the
departments of Formosa, Chaco, Corrientes, Salta, and Jujuy
provinces, which are located at the boundaries with Bolivia,
Paraguay, and Brazil. Also, they are advising vaccination for
travelers within these high-risk areas in Argentina and those
traveling to the Brazilian states of Acre, Amapa, Amazonas, the
Distrito Federal [Federal District], Goias, Maranhao, Mato Grosso,
Mato Grosso do Sul,
Minas Gerais, Para, Rondonia, Roraima, and Tocantins. Included in the
advisory are specific areas of other states, such as Bahia, Espirito
Santo, Parana, Piaui, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, and Sao Paulo.

The 1st fatal case of this new [YF] outbreak was recorded in March
2008; the yellow fever took the life of a 39-year-old man who worked
in tobacco fields. The 2nd case occurred this past Monday [29 Dec
2008]. The dead person was a youth of 19 years, also a rural worker.
The 2 dead individuals in Misiones had not been vaccinated against
this disease.

[The sylvan (jungle) cycle of YF virus transmission is continuing in
northern Argentina. Although the species of the dead monkeys is not
indicated in this article, they may be black howlers (_Alouatta]
caraya_), which have been dying recently in the area of Misiones
province (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20081220.4014). Nor is there
any mention of control of _Aedes aegypti_, the YF virus mosquito
vector, in the populated area adjacent to the farm where the dead
monkeys were found.

There is always concern about possible spill-over of the sylvan
(jungle) cycle of YF virus transmission into the urban cycle
involving _Ae. aegypti_, as occurred last year (2008) in neighboring Paraguay.
