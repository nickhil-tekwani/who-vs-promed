Gastro outbreak prompts Nagambie fishing warning
--------------------------- ------------------------
The Victorian Health Department is warning people not to eat fish caught in
the Lake Nagambie area north of Melbourne.
6 people have suffered a gastrointestinal illness after eating red fin
caught in the lake or its tributaries in recent weeks. 1 person was
treated in a hospital but all have since recovered.
Health Department spokesman Bram Alexander says the only factor common to
all the patients was eating the fish. "They all had a bout of
gastrointestinal illness but it wasn't your usual bout of gastro," he
said. "One of the other symptoms or some of the other symptoms they had
were dizziness, disorientation [and] numbness in the fingers and feet."
The department says there is no problem with the area's drinking water and
signs warning people not to eat the fish have been put up at 40 locations.

[Based on the presence of neurological signs along with the
gastroenteritis, it is possible that the illness is ciguatera. Ciguatera
is, however, usually linked to warm-water, bottom-dwelling shore reef
fish. The fish are usually large (greater than 4 pounds), having acquired
the ciguatoxin (produced by dinoflagellates) through the food chain.
Other neurotoxin diseases transmitted by shellfish and initially produced
by dinoflagellates or algae include neurotoxic (brevitoxin), paralytic
(saxitoxin), and amnestic shellfish (a glutamine analog) poisonings. - Mod.LL]
