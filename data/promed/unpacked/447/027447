A worker in a German meat factory has come down with the potentially fatal
disease anthrax, but authorities said on Thursday [11 Dec 2008] that it had
not come from the plant's meat.

The man, a French national who commutes across the border to work in the
German city of Saarbruecken, had been infected on a farm in the French
region of Lorraine, health officials said. He was under treatment.

The Saarland state health ministry and the meat company added that they had
checked the hygienic clothing he wore while handling meat and found no
spores of anthrax. Disease experts said it was highly unlikely he had
passed anthrax to the meat. "He wore gloves, disposable plastic cuffs
reaching from his wrists to his elbows and a long-armed smock while he was
working," said state health minister Gerhard Vigener.

The worker and 2 other Frenchmen living near Metz came down with anthrax at
the end of November 2008. Anthrax was diagnosed on 4 Dec 2008. Anthrax is
caused by _Bacillus anthracis_ and is now very rare in Europe.

[One can hope that the laboratory confirmation cultures were genotyped to
check whether they were the same in the 3 affected individuals. I wish that
anthrax was "very rare" in western Europe. It has essentially disappeared
from the northern European countries but is still sporadic in France and
not infrequent in Spain and southern Italy. Spain still has far too many
human cases. Further information on these cases originating in Alsace
Lorraine has been requested.
