Dr. Wahidin Sudirohusodo Hospital in the South Sulawesi capital of
Makassar is treating 4 people from Pinrang and Soppeng regencies for
displaying symptoms of avian flu virus [avian A/(H5N1) influenza
virus] infection. The patients, 3 of them children, were admitted to
the hospital on Tuesday night [28 Sep 2010] after complaining about
high fever, suffocation and coughs. They were immediately taken to the
infection center in accordance with the standard operating procedure
for avian flu treatment, the hospital's director, Kalsum Patonangi,
said Wednesday [29 Sep 2010]. "We are waiting for the laboratory
examination to confirm the status of the patients," Kalsum said.

Head of the Pinrang health agency for disease control, Dyah Puspita
Dewi, said the agency had monitored 30 people who suffered from fever.
She added 3 of them were admitted to the hospital as their health
condition worsened. "We suspect the 3 people were infected with the
bird flu virus as their fever reaches 38 C and [they] complain of
suffocation, sore throats and coughs, which are symptoms of the
disease," she said. She added the 3 patients caught a fever after
dozens of chickens near their homes suddenly died.

The regional agriculture and husbandry agency data recorded that 6300
chickens in 7 districts across Pinrang regency had died in the past
week [as a result of] avian flu virus [infection].

[Confirmation of these suspected cases is awaited. There are regular
reports in the local Indonesia Press of suspected human cases of avian
A/(H5N1) influenza virus infection, usually in association with the
deaths of large numbers of domestic poultry. Such reports are rarely
confirmed. Indeed, there have only been 6 confirmed cases of avian
A/(H5N1) influenza virus infection in Indonesia during the course of
2010, the last reported on 2 Jul 2010. See the WHO Timeline at:
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/2010_08_31_h5n1_avian_influenza_timeline_updates.pdf>, which has been updated now to 31 Aug
2010.

[One wonders whether the government is still pursuing a policy of not
confirming human cases because it perceives confirmation as giving the
country a negative image abroad. - Mod.JW]
