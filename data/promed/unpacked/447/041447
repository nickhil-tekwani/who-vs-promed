[The diagnosis of the neuraminidase component of the causative agent
in a Thai laboratory (probably NIAH, the Thai National Institute of
Animal Health in Bangkok) is a reflection of the enhanced regional
cooperation (see also item 2).

The isolate is expected to be forwarded to an official OIE reference
laboratory for final analysis, including genotyping, as suggested in

Thai and Lao authorities have stepped up cooperation in response to
the possible spread of avian influenza, particularly along the Mekong
River, which serves as much of the border between the 2 countries.

Thailand's Deputy Agriculture and Cooperatives Minister Adisorn
Piengkes met with Lao officials earlier this week to reinforce
cooperation between the health authorities of the 2 neighbouring
countries to jointly combat the spread of bird flu.

Speaking to journalists upon his returning to Bangkok Friday, Mr.
Adisorn said he attended a briefing on the deadly disease in Laos and
conferred with the Lao Minister of Agriculture and Forestry and
agreed to disclose the real situation of the disease to each other on
a regular basis in future.

Such disclosures regarding the disease would benefit both countries
as officials concerned with the potential spread of bird flu would be
more able to efficiently curtail and control the disease, he said.

Mr. Adisorn said he had also proposed a meeting of the Ayeyawady-Chao
Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy grouping (ACMECS) to be
held in Thailand to allow member countries to exchange ideas and ways
to control the avian influenza.

ACMECS membership is comprised of the 3 Indochina countries --
Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam -- as well as Myanmar and Thailand.

[3] Thailand, unauthorised vaccination

With the illegal use of bird flu vaccines in the kingdom confirmed,
Thailand's Agriculture and Cooperatives Ministry has appealed to
farmers nationwide to observe the law, explaining that vaccination
could reduce the effectiveness of practices to control the spread of
the deadly virus.

Vice Minister for Agriculture and Cooperatives Charal Trinvuthipong
affirmed on Wednesday [9 Aug 2006] the ministry has been informed
about the illegal use of bird flu vaccine in poultry, mostly in
egg-producing hens and free-range ducks, but it is quite impossible
to conduct blood tests to prove which fowl has been vaccinated.

He appealed to farmers not to smuggle the bird flu vaccine or
clandestinely use it in poultry since it can't be officially proven
that the vaccine is efficient and effective.

Dr. Charal explained that the current vaccine cannot be fully
effective in preventing the H5N1 virus and the chemical substance
remaining in vaccinated poultry can be released to the environment
[Probably this refers to the possibility that an uncertified vaccine
might be live-attenuated or insufficiently inactivated. - Mod.AS].

Even worse, he indicated, vaccination can lead to carelessness of
farmers who might have contacted with dead poultry in the belief that
their vaccinated dead fowls did not die from bird flu.

"Vaccination cannot kill the H5N1 virus; so the virus can continue
spreading without being detected since the vaccinated fowls will not
show any symptoms of bird flu," Dr. Charal added.

The ministry has ordered suppression to be stepped up against the
vaccine and offenders will face harsh punishments, he said.

Meanwhile, the vice minister reiterated that there was no indication
of any H5N1 virus mutations that could lead to an influenza pandemic
among people in Thailand.

[The Thai government has persistently adhered to an HPAI control
policy based upon stamping out without vaccination. This was mainly
guided by the wish to regain, and then maintain, Thailand's status as
an HPAI-free (exporting) country without vaccination. While
non-vaccination, combined with stringent biosecurity measures, is
feasible in commercial, intensive, contained poultry plants, its
application in small holdings and in free-range husbandry systems is
far more complex, if not impossible. In the face of the widely
distributed presence of the virus in Thailand's countryside, farmers
are compelled to seek protection of their livelihood by the use of
unauthorised, probably smuggled vaccines. Similar situations have
already led various countries to allow restricted, controlled HPAI
vaccination in certain sectors.

Cambodia's Agriculture Ministry has confirmed a new outbreak of bird
flu in poultry in the country's southeast, a ministry official said Saturday.

Kao Phal, director of the ministry's animal health department, said
the outbreak was the virulent H5N1 type of the virus.

It was detected Friday in Prey Veng province, which borders Vietnam, he said.

The H5N1 virus, which re-emerged in Asia in late 2003, has killed at
least 138 people worldwide, including 6 in Cambodia.

The announcement came after the government ordered health officials
to be on alert for possible human cases of bird flu.

The alert followed recent outbreaks of the virus in poultry in
neighboring countries and 2 recent human deaths from the disease in
Thailand, a bird flu bulletin compiled by United Nations agencies said.

It said the Cambodian Ministry of Health has "called all provincial
rapid response teams to put them on alert and ask them to follow up
with hospitals and health centers" on suspected human cases of bird flu.

On Friday [11 Aug 2006], Vietnam reported its 1st cases of bird flu
in poultry since December, sparking fears of a resurgence of the
virus in the country, which had been hailed for controlling its spread.

The U.N. bulletin said that since early this month, a Cambodian bird
flu telephone "hot line" had received more than 150 calls from people
in the countryside informing officials about dead poultry or asking
for information about symptoms of the disease.

It also said a daily one-hour radio call-in program about bird flu
was launched early this month on a local station.

The bulletin is published jointly by the World Health Organization
[WHO], the Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO] and UNICEF.

The government has also enlisted Buddhist monks to help spread
information on the virus. Workshops will be held this month for monks
and other citizens at 2538 pagodas in 11 provinces, the U.N. said Wednesday.

Agriculture Minister Anton Apriantono said the government had culled
some 5.9 million fowls in various affected regions since the outbreak
of bird flu in Indonesia in 2004.

"Besides that, the government has also provided free vaccines for 262
million birds," the minister said after a coordinating meeting on
bird flu control at the office of the Coordinating Minister for
People's Welfare here on Wednesday [9 Aug 2006].

He said that the government has been conducting routine surveillance
over fowls in endemic places and cooperating with local universities
to find 'hotspots' where the bird flu virus would most likely spread.

The minister said that at present there were about 30 million
households which raised fowls so that it was quite difficult for the
government to control all of them.

Indonesia has reported 2 deaths from avian influenza this week,
bringing the country's death toll from the disease to 44.

The island nation now has the dubious honor of being the worst bird
flu-hit country in the world.

The World Health Organization confirmed that a 17-year-old girl from
Jakarta province and a 6-year-old boy from West Java province had
succumbed to the potentially fatal disease, which has killed at least
138 people since it was initially reported to be affecting humans in 2003.

According to WHO, the boy died Monday. He had been in regular contact
with sick and dying chickens -- later found to be carrying an H5
strain of avian influenza -- in his home, authorities said.

The girl died Tuesday. She kept pigeons in her home, and lived in an
area where many kept poultry. Local flocks are currently being tested
for signs of H5N1 infection.

"Animal health authorities have collected samples from birds in the
neighborhood and these will be tested as part of the continuing
investigation," the WHO said in a statement.

Viet Nam, worried about a recurrence of the H5N1 bird flu which has
already killed 42 of its people, has found more ducks and geese
infected with a strain of avian influenza, state media reported on
Friday [11 Aug 2006].

The Saigon Giai Phong (Liberation Saigon) newspaper quoted Dong Manh
Hoa, head of the Ho Chi Minh City Regional Veterinary Centre, as
saying tests of the waterfowl in Tien Giang, Long An and Ben Tre
provinces revealed the H5 subtype virus. [Viet Nam's 61 provinces are
presented in the interactive map
<http://www.angelfire.com/co/hongnam/vnmap.html>.
- Mod. AS]

A Ben Tre official told Reuters on Thursday more than 50 healthy
waterfowl had been killed in the province after tests showed they had
the H5 subtype, but there had been no outbreaks.

The H5N1 virus swept across much of Asia in late 2003 and, although
it has shown no signs of doing so yet, experts fear it could mutate
into a form that can pass easily between people.

It has not killed anyone in Vietnam this year, but recurrences in
Thailand, Laos and China have alarmed Hanoi officials worried their
country has become complacent.

In an urgent directive issued on Thursday, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan
Dung told officials "to focus strongly on instructing and deploying
forces to carry out synchronised, preventive measures".

Officials say a failure to control waterfowl, which can be silent
carriers of bird flu, made Vietnam vulnerable to new outbreaks and
wild birds believed to carry H5N1 would migrate soon from the north,
raising the risk of outbreaks [see comment].

Farmers in the Mekong Delta have been raising ducks in large numbers
despite a ban on breeding waterfowl due to remain in place until
February 2007. At this time of year, when a rice harvest is underway
in the region, ducks usually roam from field to field feeding on spilled grain.

[Laboratory findings on the full identity of the H5 virus strain,
detected in symptomless ducks and geese in Viet Nam, and its
pathogenicity for poultry, are anticipated.

H5N1 seems to have renewed its (seasonal?) activity in Southeast Asia.

The concern about the reintroduction of HPAI to Viet Nam by migrating
birds from the north, expressed in the article, are not groundless.
