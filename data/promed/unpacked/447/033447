Diarrhoea which gripped some Village Development Committees of the Dhankuta
district have spread to some other VDCs. Seven people have already died of
diarrhoea in the Marekatahare and Leguwa VDCs. Diarrhoea has recently
spread to wards No. 2,7,8 and 9 of Chanuwa VDC while more than 50 patients
suffering from this disease are undergoing treatment at the local hospital.
Assistant Health Worker of Chanuwa Ilaka Health Post Yogendra Prasad Shaha
told The Kathmandu Post that a medical team dispatched by the District
Health Office has arrived in the VDC area. Similarly, the disease has also
affected the people of Belhara, Chungmang, Sanne and Dhankuta municipality
area. At a time when the number of such patients admitted to Dhankuta
District Hospital has been increasing, patients are receiving treatment
from Assistant Health Workers.
