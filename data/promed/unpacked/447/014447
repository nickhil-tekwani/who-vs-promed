[The following response was received from an EpiCore Surveillance Project member regarding norovirus in Palermo, Sicily, Italy. - Mod.LL]

I received preliminary information about this event by media. I live in the same district of the resort where the incident occurred. It looks like the hypothesis that the Health Authorities thought more plausible was cross-transmission mediated by objects or surfaces starting from a child with diarrhoea. In the same interval of time, however, it was forbidden to drink municipal water of some areas near the resort and [samples were] submitted for repeated microbiological tests. No new cases were apparent since the opening of the resort.
