Oita Prefecture announced on [13 Oct 2021] that a woman (in her 80s) in Kunisaki City developed Japanese encephalitis and died. This is the 1st time that deaths due to Japanese encephalitis have been confirmed in the prefecture since 2006 when statistics began.

According to the prefecture, the woman was hospitalized with a fever of 39.1 deg C [102.3 deg F] on [12 Sep 2021] and died on [29 Sep 2021]. She was diagnosed on the [8 Oct 2021] by a post-mortem examination when the Eastern Health Center was contacted.

[ProMED-mail thanks Mahmoud Orabi for submitting this report.

Although Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable encephalitis in Asia and the western Pacific, human cases are rare in Japan.

This is the 1st JE report since a ProMED post concerning JE vaccine use in 2005 that mentioned multiple JE cases in Japan in 2002 (see Japanese encephalitis - Japan (02): vaccinations halted 20050603.1545). The case above indicates that JE virus was present in the prefecture in September 2021 and a vector mosquito, likely _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_, transmitted the virus to the woman.

In Asia, JE virus is maintained in ardeid wading birds, can be amplified in pigs, and is transmitted by several _Culex_ spp. mosquitoes that breed in rice fields. A vaccine for human use is available in Japan. - Mod.TY
