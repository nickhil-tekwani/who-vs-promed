The SARS-CoV-2 variant first documented in Britain could become the primary strain in the USA by March [2021], researchers found. Despite only 76 infections with the variant, B.1.1.7 or VOC 202012/01, detected in the USA through 13 Jan 2021, models predict it will crowd out other strains and become the most common cause of COVID-19 by March [2021], according to Summer Galloway, PhD, of the CDC, and colleagues, writing in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report [see reference citation below]:

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
A more highly transmissible variant of SARS-CoV-2, B.1.1.7, has been detected in 10 US states.

What is added by this report?
Modeling data indicate that B.1.1.7 has the potential to increase the US pandemic trajectory in the coming months. CDC's system for genomic surveillance and the effort to expand sequencing will increase the availability of timely US genomic surveillance data.

What are the implications for public health practice?
The increased transmissibility of the B.1.1.7 variant warrants universal and increased compliance with mitigation strategies, including distancing and masking. Higher vaccination coverage might need to be achieved to protect the public. Genomic sequence analysis through the National SARS-CoV-2 Strain Surveillance program will enable a targeted approach to identifying variants of concern in the USA.

On 14 Dec 2020, the United Kingdom reported a SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC), lineage B.1.1.7, also referred to as VOC 202012/01 or 20I/501Y.V1. The B.1.1.7 variant is estimated to have emerged in September 2020 and has quickly become the dominant circulating SARS-CoV-2 variant in England (1). B.1.1.7 has been detected in over 30 countries, including the USA. As of 13 Jan 2021, approximately 76 cases of B.1.1.7 have been detected in 10 US states. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that B.1.1.7 is more efficiently transmitted than are other SARS-CoV-2 variants (1-3). The modeled trajectory of this variant in the USA exhibits rapid growth in early 2021, becoming the predominant variant in March [2021]. Increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission might threaten strained healthcare resources, require extended and more rigorous implementation of public health strategies (4), and increase the percentage of population immunity required for pandemic control. Taking measures to reduce transmission now can lessen the potential impact of B.1.1.7 and allow critical time to increase vaccination coverage. Collectively, enhanced genomic surveillance combined with continued compliance with effective public health measures, including vaccination, physical distancing, use of masks, hand hygiene, and isolation and quarantine, will be essential to limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Strategic testing of persons without symptoms but at higher risk of infection, such as those exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or who have frequent unavoidable contact with the public, provides another opportunity to limit ongoing spread.

Global genomic surveillance and rapid open-source sharing of viral genome sequences have facilitated near real-time detection, comparison, and tracking of evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants that can inform public health efforts to control the pandemic. Whereas some mutations in the viral genome emerge and then recede, others might confer a selective advantage to the variant, including enhanced transmissibility, so that such a variant can rapidly dominate other circulating variants. Early in the pandemic, variants of SARS-CoV-2 containing the D614G mutation in the spike (S) protein that increases receptor binding avidity rapidly became dominant in many geographic regions (5,6).

In late fall 2020, multiple countries reported detecting SARS-CoV-2 variants that spread more efficiently. In addition to the B.1.1.7 variant, notable variants include the B.1.351 lineage first detected in South Africa and the recently identified B.1.1.28 subclade (renamed "P.1") detected in 4 travelers from Brazil during routine screening at the Haneda (Tokyo) airport. These variants carry a constellation of genetic mutations, including in the S protein receptor-binding domain, which is essential for binding to the host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor to facilitate virus entry. Evidence suggests that other mutations found in these variants might confer not only increased transmissibility but might also affect the performance of some diagnostic real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays and reduce susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies (2,3,5-10). A recent case report documented the 1st case of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in Brazil with a SARS-CoV-2 variant that contained the E484K mutation, which has been shown to reduce neutralization by convalescent sera and monoclonal antibodies (9,10).

This report focuses on the emergence of the B.1.1.7 variant in the USA. As of 12 Jan 2021, neither the B.1.351 nor the P.1 variants have been detected in the USA. For information about emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, CDC maintains a webpage dedicated to providing information on emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/science-and-research/scientific-brief-emerging-variants.html).

B.1.1.7 lineage (20I/501Y.V1)
The B.1.1.7 variant carries a mutation in the S protein (N501Y) that affects the conformation of receptor-binding domain. This variant has 13 other B.1.1.7 lineage-defining mutations (Table), several of which are in the S protein, including a deletion at positions 69 and 70 (del69-70) that evolved spontaneously in other SARS-CoV-2 variants and is hypothesized to increase transmissibility (2,7). The deletion at positions 69 and 70 causes S-gene target failure (SGTF) in at least one RT-PCR-based diagnostic assay (i.e., with the ThermoFisher TaqPath COVID-19 assay, the B.1.1.7 variant and other variants with the del69-70 produce a negative result for S-gene target and a positive result for the other 2 targets); SGTF has served as a proxy in the United Kingdom for identifying B.1.1.7 cases (1).

Multiple lines of evidence indicate that B.1.1.7 is more efficiently transmitted compared with other SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in the United Kingdom. UK regions with a higher proportion of B.1.1.7 sequences had faster epidemic growth than did other areas, diagnoses with SGTF increased faster than did non-SGTF diagnoses in the same areas, and a higher proportion of contacts were infected by index patients with B.1.1.7 infections than by index patients infected with other variants (1,3).

Variant B.1.1.7 has the potential to increase the US pandemic trajectory in the coming months. To illustrate this effect, a simple, 2-variant compartmental model was developed. The current US prevalence of B.1.1.7 among all circulating viruses is unknown but is thought to be less than 0.5% based on the limited number of cases detected and SGTF data (8). For the model, initial assumptions included a B.1.1.7 prevalence of 0.5% among all infections, SARS-CoV-2 immunity from previous infection of 10%-30%, a time-varying reproductive number (Rt) of 1.1 (mitigated but increasing transmission) or 0.9 (decreasing transmission) for current variants, and a reported incidence of 60 cases per 100 000 persons per day on 1 Jan 2021. These assumptions do not precisely represent any single US location but rather indicate a generalization of conditions common across the country. The change in Rt over time resulting from acquired immunity and increasing prevalence of B.1.1.7, was modeled, with the B.1.1.7 Rt assumed to be a constant 1.5 times the Rt of current variants, based on initial estimates from the United Kingdom (1,3).

Next, the potential impact of vaccination was modeled assuming that one million vaccine doses were administered per day beginning 1 Jan 2021, and that 95% immunity was achieved 14 days after receipt of 2 doses. Specifically, immunity against infection with either current variants or the B.1.1.7 variant was assumed, although the effectiveness and duration of protection against infection remains uncertain because these were not the primary endpoint of clinical trials for initial vaccines.

In this model, B.1.1.7 prevalence is initially low, yet because it is more transmissible than are current variants, it exhibits rapid growth in early 2021, becoming the predominant variant in March [2021] (Figure 1). Whether transmission of current variants is increasing (initial Rt = 1.1) or slowly decreasing (initial Rt = 0.9) in January [2021], B.1.1.7 drives a substantial change in the transmission trajectory and a new phase of exponential growth. With vaccination that protects against infection, the early epidemic trajectories do not change and B.1.1.7 spread still occurs (Figure 2). However, after B.1.1.7 becomes the dominant variant, its transmission was substantially reduced. The effect of vaccination on reducing transmission in the near term was greatest in the scenario in which transmission was already decreasing (initial Rt = 0.9) (Figure 2). Early efforts that can limit the spread of the B.1.1.7 variant, such as universal and increased compliance with public health mitigation strategies, will allow more time for ongoing vaccination to achieve higher population-level immunity.

Discussion
The findings in this report are subject to at least 3 limitations. First, the magnitude of the increase in transmissibility in the USA compared with that observed in the United Kingdom remains unclear. Second, the prevalence of B.1.1.7 in the USA is also unknown at this time, but detection of variants and estimation of prevalence will improve with enhanced US surveillance efforts. Finally [third], local mitigation measures are also highly variable, leading to variation in Rt. The specific outcomes presented here are based on simulations and assumed no change in mitigations beyond 1 Jan 2021.

The increased transmissibility of the B.1.1.7 variant warrants rigorous implementation of public health strategies to reduce transmission and lessen the potential impact of B.1.1.7, buying critical time to increase vaccination coverage. CDC's modeling data show that universal use of and increased compliance with mitigation measures and vaccination are crucial to reduce the number of new cases and deaths substantially in the coming months. Further, strategic testing of persons without symptoms of COVID-19, but who are at increased risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2, provides another opportunity to limit ongoing spread. Collectively, enhanced genomic surveillance combined with increased compliance with public health mitigation strategies, including vaccination, physical distancing, use of masks, hand hygiene, and isolation and quarantine, will be essential to limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and protecting public health.

[Increased transmissibility will lead to an increase in cases and likely increased opportunity for the virus to mutate further possibly towards greater virulence, which the current mutations have not changed. It is critical that the vaccine rollout occurs as quickly as possible and that individuals wear masks, wash hands frequently, and maintain physical distance from each other to dampen virus spread. Public health labs are advised to sequence the virus to determine prevalence of the variants, and to be on the alert for inability to detect viral RNA in suspect cases, suggesting the primers/probe need to be redesigned. - Mod.LK]

Global situation summary
Since the 1st confirmed cases of COVID-19 until 15 Jan 2021, a cumulative total of 91 492 398 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, including 1 979 507 deaths, representing a total of 23 326 521 additional confirmed cases and 422 122 additional deaths since the last PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Update on COVID-193 published on 11 Dec 2020. As of 15 Jan 2021, of the global total, WHO Region of the Americas and the WHO European Region represent 77% of the total confirmed cases and 80% of the total deaths. The Region of the Americas represents 44% (40 548 449) of the total confirmed cases and 48% (940 455) of the total deaths, and the European Region represents 33% (29 748 909) of the total cases and 33% (649 106) of the total deaths (Figure 1 [see source URL for all figures, tables, and references]).

The increase in cases in all the Americas is also reflected in the intensity of transmission; until 14 Jan 2021, community transmission was observed in 35 of the 56 countries and territories. Of the total confirmed cases in 2020, 43% occurred between November and December, with December being the month with the highest number of reported cases. Regarding deaths [in 2020], 35% occurred between October and December and 25% between July and August, with August being the month with the highest number of deaths. When the period of observation of the trend decreases to the last 7 days, 16 of the 56 countries and territories of the Americas show increases of 50.0% or greater in the number of confirmed cases, with a range between 50% and 3200%, while 11 of them show an increase between 68% and 500% in confirmed deaths (Table 1).

Epidemiological highlights
I. SARS-CoV-2 variants
As PAHO/WHO communicated in the "Occurrence of variants of SARS-CoV-2 in the Americas. Preliminary information" publication of 11 Jan 2021 [available at https://www.paho.org/en/documents/occurrence-variants-sars-cov-2-americas-preliminary-information], the appearance of mutations is a natural and expected event within the evolutionary process of viruses. Since the initial genomic characterization of SARS-CoV-2, this virus has been divided into different genetic groups or clades. In fact, some specific mutations define the viral genetic groups (also called lineages) that are currently circulating globally. Due to several microevolution processes and selection pressures, some additional mutations may appear, generating differences within each genetic group (called variants).... With the information available to date, most of the changes in SARS-CoV-2 have had little or no impact on how it is transmitted or on the severity of the disease it causes.

In recent months, 2 different variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported to WHO as unusual public health events: in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, named VOC 202012/01, belonging to the B.1.1.7 lineage, and in South Africa, named 501Y.V2, belonging to the B.1.351 lineage. Findings and preliminary data, epidemiological, modeling, phylogenetic as well as clinical, suggest that SARS-CoV-2 VOC 202012/01 has higher transmissibility. However, to date, the preliminary analysis does not indicate that there are changes in the severity of the disease (measured by the duration of hospitalization and the 28-day case fatality rate), or the occurrence of reinfection among cases positive for this variant compared to cases infected by other SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating in the United Kingdom (UK). The increase in transmissibility is of concern; because even though positive cases by other SARS-CoV-2 lineages do not seem to show a higher severity of disease, the increased transmissibility is associated with an important public health impact, due to the increase in cases in a limited period.

As of 12 Jan 2021, outside the UK, 50 countries and territories in 5 of the 6 WHO regions have reported VOC 202012/01 cases.

In relation to the 501Y.V2 variant, outside of South Africa, 20 countries and territories, in the 6 WHO regions, have reported cases of this variant.

In South Africa, the new variant of SARS-CoV-2 has been observed to be spreading rapidly in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and KwaZulu-Natal provinces and has largely replaced other circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses in those provinces. While genomic data highlighted that the 501.V2 variant rapidly displaced other circulating lineages in South Africa, and preliminary studies suggest that the variant is associated with a higher viral load, which may suggest a potential for increased transmissibility, this, as well as other factors that influence transmissibility, are subject to further investigation. Also, at this stage, there is no clear evidence that the new variant is associated with higher severity of disease or worse outcomes. More research is needed to understand the impact on transmission, clinical severity of infection, laboratory diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines, or preventive public health measures. While this new variant does not appear to cause more severe illness, the observed rapid increases in case numbers has placed health systems under additional pressure.

On 9 Jan 2021, Japan notified WHO of a new SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.28 (initially reported as B.1.1.248) detected in 4 travelers arriving from Brazil. This variant has 12 mutations to the spike protein, including 3 mutations of concern in common with 501Y.V2, ie, K417N/T, E484K and N501Y, which may impact transmissibility and host immune response. Researchers in Brazil have additionally reported the emergence of a similar variant also with a E484K mutation, which has likely evolved independently of the variant detected among the travelers. The extent and public health significance of these new variants require further epidemiological and laboratory investigation.

Regarding the situation in the Americas, as of 14 Jan 2021, 8 countries have reported the detection of the VOC 202012/01 variant, one country the detection of the 501Y.V2 variant, and one country the detection of mutations of potential interest for public health (Table 2).

II. COVID-19 among older adults (60 years of age and older)
The increased risk of loss of functional reserve is exacerbated by the higher prevalence of coexisting diseases, conditions that increase as age advances, leading to a greater acquisition of infections, leaving older adults as one of the groups most vulnerable to losing their lives due to COVID-19. This explains the trend, observed in most countries, of people aged over 60 years old presenting age-specific mortality rates much higher than those of 59 years old and below. It is expected that, by prioritizing this age-group for receipt of the COVID-19 vaccines, the corresponding mortality rate will decline.

One way to measure the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people aged 60 and over (older adults) is through age-specific mortality rates. Data are presented below for countries for which information was available (Table 3).

- The proportion of deaths from COVID-19 in older adults is greater than 50% (range 57% to 80%)
- Specific death rates for people over 60 years old exceed specific death rates for people under 60 years of age by a range of 11 to 28 times.

III. COVID-19 during pregnancy
Since the 1st reported cases of COVID-19 in the Americas until 14 Jan 2021, there were 139 016 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases among pregnant women reported, including 802 deaths (1%), in 19 countries/territories for which information was available (Table 4). Compared to the data in the 11 Dec 2020 PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Update, this represents an increase of 18 065 new cases and 105 new deaths. During the same period, the highest relative increases in confirmed cases and deaths were observed in Venezuela.

IV. COVID-19 among indigenous populations
In a report on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Pan-Amazon, published by the Panamazonic Ecclesiastical Network (REPAM), information regarding the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the Amazon Ecclesiastical Jurisdictions of each of the countries of the region is presented (Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, French Guiana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela). The report covers the period between March [2020] and October 2020. According to the report, the Amazon population is 33.6 million people and the number of COVID-19 cases among them is 1 377 609, including 34 054 deaths. Of the total number of cases, 5.3% are among the indigenous populations, as well as 6.3% of the deaths.

With respect to the geographical distribution of the cases, in Bolivia 48% of the total number of cases in the country are in the Amazon region; the Bolivian Amazon constitutes 65% of the national territory. In comparison with the other countries analyzed, the Amazon region of Peru represents 60.6% of the territory while 22% of their cases were reported there; in Brazil the Amazon region represents 56% of its territory and 19% of their cases were reported there; in Ecuador the Amazon region represents 45.7% of its territory and 8% of their cases were reported there; in Colombia, the Amazon is represents 42% of its territory and 4.99% of their cases were reported there; and in contrast, Venezuela reported 11.13% of its cases in the Amazon region though it comprises only 5.56% of its national territory (Figure 2).

Since the 1st confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Region of the Americas and as of 14 Jan 2021, there have been 303 734 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 4406 deaths, reported among indigenous populations in 14 countries in the Region of the Americas for which information was available (Table 5). Compared to the data in the 11 Dec 2020 PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Update on COVID-193, this represents an increase of 66 371 confirmed cases including 458 additional deaths. The largest relative increase in cases and deaths occurred in Canada.

V. Multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) in children and adolescents temporally related to COVID-19
On 15 May 2020, WHO issued a Scientific Brief on multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and adolescents temporally related to COVID-19 (MIS-C) in response to reports initially received from Europe and North America regarding clusters of children and adolescents requiring admission to intensive care units with a multisystem inflammatory condition with some features similar to those of Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome. MIS-C has been characterized as an acute illness accompanied by a hyperinflammatory syndrome, leading to multiorgan failure and shock. While the scientific knowledge base regarding MIS-C continues to evolve, MIS-C has been observed temporally in relation to COVID-19.

As of 14 Jan 2021, a total of 2737 cumulative MIS confirmed cases that temporally coincide with COVID-19, including 78 deaths, have been reported by 17 countries/territories of the Region of the Americas that have officially notified PAHO/WHO or have published information through an official website (Table 6). This represents a relative increase of 17% in cases (462 additional cases) and 8% in deaths (6 additional deaths) since the 11 Dec 2020 PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Update on COVID-19.

As of 14 Jan 2021, 25 countries/territories have officially reported to PAHO/WHO that they have not detected cases of MIS.

The following is a brief description of the MIS epidemiological situation in the Americas. Of the total number of reported cases, for which data on age are available (n = 2648), 66% were between 0 and 9 years of age at the time of illness and only 10% were in the age-group between 15 and 19 years. Regarding the outcome of these cases, the highest proportion of deaths is observed among the 15- to 19-year age-group (Figure 3). Regarding the distribution by sex, for which data are available (n = 2627), 56% of the cases are male.

VI. COVID-19 among healthcare workers
While the global proportion of healthcare workers in most countries corresponds to less than 3% of the overall population, the proportion is almost 5 times higher, or more, if the proportion of healthcare workers among total COVID-19 cases is observed.

The following aspects are highlighted as important to consider in the analysis of the available data on the epidemiological situation of COVID-19 among healthcare workers:

- Information on the place where infection was acquired (eg, whether in the community or in a healthcare setting) has not been provided for most cases reported among healthcare workers.
- Differences exist by sex: females account for the majority of cases, whereas males account for the majority of deaths among healthcare workers.

Since the confirmation of the 1st COVID-19 cases in the Region of the Americas until 14 Jan 2021, 30 countries/territories in the Americas have reported cases and deaths among healthcare workers.

According to the information available on confirmed cases and deaths, the information provided by 14 countries of the Americas indicates that as of 14 Jan 2021, 1 208 370 cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported, including 5780 deaths in healthcare workers (Table 7).

[3] CoronaVac: Killed vaccine efficacy
Date: Fri 15 Jan 2021
Source: Nature [abridged, edited]
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00094-z


Long-awaited results about the effectiveness of a leading Chinese COVID-19 vaccine were tinged with disappointment and confusion this week. But researchers say the vaccine could help reduce deaths from the disease. Researchers in Brazil reported that CoronaVac, developed by Beijing-based Sinovac, was 50.4% effective at preventing severe and mild COVID-19 in late-stage trials. That's significantly lower than the 90% efficacies of several leading vaccines.

The CoronaVac figures were much lower than those from early trials of the same vaccine in Turkey and Indonesia, and below the efficacy first reported by the Brazil trial team last week. Researchers from the Butantan Institute in Sao Paulo had announced on 7 Jan 2021 that the vaccine's efficacy was 78% at preventing the disease -- but revealed this week that the figure was based on the narrow criteria of people needing medical attention.

Still, if the latest results check out -- they have not been peer reviewed -- the 2-dose vaccine could be immediately beneficial in countries with raging outbreaks, such as Brazil, say researchers. "When you've got communities that are absolutely desperate, and have no other choice, then this is a really great thing to have," says Hilda Bastian, who studies evidence-based medicine at Bond University in the Gold Coast, Australia.

The Brazil trial recorded 252 cases of COVID-19 -- 167 in people who received the placebo and 85 who were vaccinated -- in some 9200 healthcare workers. None of the participants who received the vaccine had to be hospitalized with severe COVID-19. If the data are confirmed, the vaccine could have a role in preventing disease in every country, says Paul Offit, a vaccine scientist at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania.

Flow-on effects
Brazil's data are important for Turkey, which yesterday [14 Jan 2021] began its plan to roll out millions of CoronaVac doses under an emergency-use authorization announced on 13 Jan 2021, says Murat Akova, a clinical infectious-diseases researcher at Hacettepe University School of Medicine in Ankara, who is a coordinator of a late-stage CoronaVac trial in Turkey.

Delays in Brazil's reporting of trial results meant that Turkey relied on early data from its own efficacy trial when it agreed to distribute CoronaVac, says Akova. In late December [2020], the Turkey trial reported that CoronaVac was 91.25% effective at preventing symptomatic disease on the basis of 29 COVID-19 cases among 1322 volunteers.

Brazil's results are disappointing when compared with the 2 RNA-based frontrunners, developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which were found to be more than 90% effective in trials, says Akova. But CoronaVac is still valuable to Turkey because it will prevent most severe cases.

Indonesia has also authorized CoronaVac for emergency use and started its national vaccination programme on 13 Jan 2021. Results from an efficacy trial of about 1600 people in that country found the vaccine was 65.3% effective at preventing symptomatic disease on the basis of 25 COVID-19 cases, says Jarir At Thobari, a vaccinologist at Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Given Indonesia's large population, a lot of people could benefit from the vaccine even at 65% effectiveness, he says.

Scientists say mixed results are not surprising for a vaccine with lower efficacy that has been tested in relatively small numbers of people. Mixed results have also been reported from trials of the COVID-19 vaccine developed by the University of Oxford, UK, and drug firm AstraZeneca. "If you've got a vaccine with really high efficacy, you don't need a whole lot of numbers to get a clear picture. But when it's complicated, then you really need bigger numbers to get a better handle on what's going on," says Bastian.

Researchers involved with the Brazil trial say the lower efficacy compared with other vaccines could be because the 2 shots were administered only 2 weeks apart, which did not leave sufficient time for participants to reach peak immunity. They also say that the trial, which recruited only health professionals, who are more likely to be exposed to the virus, report symptoms and get tested, probably identified more mild infections than did trials in Indonesia and Turkey, which included the public. The Brazilian health regulator, Anvisa, will decide whether to approve CoronaVac and AstraZeneca's vaccine for emergency use on 17 Jan 2021. Some 7 million doses of CoronaVac have already been distributed across China.

Other benefits
The roll out of CoronaVac, which uses an inactivated version of SARS-CoV-2 to induce an immune response (1 [see source URL for reference]), could see more widespread use in other nations, says Adrian Esterman, a biostatistician at University of South Australia in Adelaide. Compared with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which must be stored at -70 deg C [-94 deg F], CoronaVac is stable at fridge temperatures and easier to distribute.

On the basis of the data reported so far, the vaccine seems safe, with only a few people experiencing mild symptoms such as headache.

A World Health Organization (WHO) team in China is reviewing manufacturing practices for Sinovac's vaccine, and those produced by Chinese state-owned Sinopharm. If the WHO lists the vaccines for emergency use, that will accelerate their global distribution, says Bastian.

[It is curious that a 2-week interval between doses was chosen for the study, as other killed virus vaccines (such as IPV [inactivated poliovirus vaccine] and hepatitis A vaccine) have a minimum interval of 4 weeks between doses to allow for the full robust immune response to the vaccine. One wonders if another trial might be conducted using a 4-week interval to see if the efficacy improves with a longer interval between doses.

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (254 019), Brazil (68 138), UK (55 761), and Spain (40 197) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 15 447 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 14 Jan to late 15 Jan 2021).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (15 countries) include the USA, Brazil, UK, Spain, Russia (24 715), Mexico (21 366), France (21 271), Colombia (21 078), Germany (19 817), Italy (16 144), India (15 151), South Africa (14 880), Indonesia (12 818), Argentina (12 332), and Portugal (10 663). A total of 55 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 28 of the 55 countries that reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 12 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 4 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased negligibly by 0.81%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 9.5%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 10.5% decrease in daily reported cases and a 9.2% increase in reported deaths (the USA has now reported over 400 000 deaths due to COVID-19).

Impression: The global daily reported cases are over 750 000 newly confirmed infections daily in the past 24 hours and over 94.30 million cumulative reported cases with over 2.01 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts. Africa has been showing increases over the last few weeks with now 4 countries reporting over 1000 cases per day. China has been reporting over 100 new cases per day for 5 out of the last 6 days, and it appears as though daily case counts are decreasing in South Korea. I suspect that the marked changes in the comparative 7-day averages are a subtle sign of the beginning of weekend artifacts with reduced reporting...unless the major lockdowns in Europe are impacting transmission. As there haven't been major restrictions implemented in the USA as yet, I'd bet on weekend artifact in reporting. - Mod.MPP]
