Transmission of Human Pathogen to Coral Reefs to be Studied by UGA Researchers
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The spread of lethal diseases from animals to humans has long been an
issue of great concern to public health officials. But what about
diseases that spread in the other direction, from humans to wildlife?
A multidisciplinary team of researchers at the University of Georgia
(UGA) has just been awarded a 5-year USD 2 million Ecology of
Infectious Diseases grant from the National Science Foundation and
National Institutes of Health to study the first known case of such a
"reverse zoonosis" that involves the transmission of a human pathogen
to a marine invertebrate, elkhorn coral.

White pox disease has devastated coral reefs throughout the Caribbean
and Florida Keys, and is believed to be responsible for much of the
coral reef loss there since 1996. White pox disease is caused by a
human strain of the common intestinal bacterium _Serratia
marcescens_, which causes the hospital infection serratiosis.
Historically, many emerging human diseases, such as AIDS and Ebola,
have come from the natural world. The researchers are concerned that
the transmission of _Serratia marcescens_ from humans to elkhorn
coral may indicate the beginning of a new phenomenon of diseases
jumping from humans to wildlife.

The UGA team will investigate the mechanisms of transmission of white
pox disease and the factors that drive its emergence in marine
animals. "This bacterium has jumped from vertebrate to invertebrate,
from terrestrial to marine, and from anaerobic to aerobic
environments," said James W. Porter, associate dean of the Odum
School of Ecology and the team's leader. "Triple jumps like this are
rare." Understanding the modes of transmission will allow the
scientists to attempt to predict future impacts of the disease and to
begin to develop effective control strategies.

The scope of the team's research will extend beyond gaining an
understanding of the impact of white pox disease on elkhorn coral and
how to counter it. The most likely source of the pathogen for coral
reefs is under-treated human sewage, so the study will also explore
the intersection of public health practices and environmental health
outcomes.

"This investigation addresses not only environmental protection, but
also the socio-ecological determinants of coastal zone protection,"
said Porter. "This includes the cost of wastewater treatment
infrastructure. Given a reliance on tourism by most Caribbean
countries, this study addresses a disease system that is of great
economic importance and public health concern to developing nations."

The complexity of the problem required assembling a team of
researchers from different scientific disciplines. "The Odum School
is extremely well-positioned to lead this study," said Dean John
Gittleman. "Working effectively in collaboration with units from
across campus is one of our strengths, and aquatic ecology,
theoretical ecology and disease ecology are 3 of our areas of
particular depth that facilitate such interdisciplinary team
building."

Porter, who has spent decades studying coral reefs in the Florida
Keys and the Caribbean, said that this is the most exciting and
groundbreaking study of his career. "This is science in action to
save an endangered species and a threatened ecosystem," he said. "We
are linking good public health practices to effective environmental
protection."

Microbiologist Erin K. Lipp, associate professor of environmental
health science in the College of Public Health, will be looking at
the genetic diversity of _Serratia marcescens_ to determine which of
its different strains are pathogenic to corals, and why. She will
collect and analyze samples to determine how the different strains of
the bacterium are related, and will then conduct challenge
experiments. "We'll inoculate fragments of corals with different
strains and see which cause signs of disease," said Lipp. "If we can
identify strains that do versus those that don't cause disease, we
can then conduct genetic comparisons to isolate the genes that are
responsible."

Assistant professor Andrew W. Park, who has a joint appointment in
the School of Ecology and College of Veterinary Medicine department
of infectious diseases, will use the data gathered by Porter and Lipp
to create models to inform analysis of the spread of the disease. "My
part of the project is about making sense of the data in terms of
transmission," said Park. "We'll use the modeling to help test the
hypothesis that there is variation for resistance to the bacteria and
explore different candidate hypotheses for how the disease spreads.
The pathogen can be spread in different ways -- for instance, by
predatory snails, or through water currents. We're trying to untangle
all those competing explanations."

John Wares, assistant professor of genetics in the Franklin College
of Arts and Sciences, will be looking into the interactions of the
pathogen with the microbial environment of coral reefs in the
Caribbean. Unlike humans, corals do not have classic immune systems,
with white blood cells to take on and destroy invading bacteria.
Instead, they appear to rely primarily on external defense systems,
such as beneficial bacteria that live on their surface. Wares will
investigate this system to determine whether healthy bacterial
communities can defend corals from disease. "This is essentially
high-tech community ecology," said Wares. "I'll be looking at what
organisms are living on the coral and what role they play in
promoting coral immunity." He said he is excited about the
opportunity to use next-generation genetic sequencing, through the
Georgia Genomics Facility at UGA. "In the past, we might have been
limited to looking at a sample of a few hundred microbes from a given
sample!
of the community," he said. "For this study, we can study tens of
thousands from each sample. It will be very powerful."

Understanding the transmission process is critical, but Porter said
that the study has wider implications. "By incorporating the role of
land use practices and water quality into our environmental models of
disease prevalence and transmission, this project will have
particular significance for sustainable development activities and
coastal-zone carrying capacity studies worldwide," he said. "The
modeling element of this study connects disease transmission with
water quality, climate variability and patterns of human population
density. We expect to show that if you upgrade land-based wastewater
disposal systems you improve survival of economically important
natural resources such as coral reefs."

[This sounds like an exciting and worthwhile study. It may impact
developing nations, but it seems likely that it could focus on better
sanitation efforts in developed nations, if this does prove to be the
cause of some of the coral diseases and die-offs.

While this article does not tell us, it would seem the researcher
will need an "artificial ocean" or risk infecting areas in the ocean
which would seem counter productive to what they are wishing to
accomplish.

Hopefully the research and modeling will also provide methods of
prevention and even cures for the ailing coral reefs. - Mod.TG]

[_Serratia marcescens_ is a Gram-negative bacillus in the family
Enterobacteriaceae. Some strains produce a red-to-pink pigment that
may have been the cause of the development of bloody discoloration of
food as described as early as the 6th century BC by Pythagoras (1).
Until the middle of the 20th century, the organism was considered a
harmless commensal (reasonable definition: an organism that eats with
you, not eats you) but is now considered a potential cause of a
variety of human infections, often nosocomial (hospital acquired) in
origin.

The bacterium may be quite resistant to many antimicrobial agents.
During the time when it was considered to be a nonpathogen, it was
reported to have been used as a biologic marker for biowarfare by the
US military, having been released in the Pacific Ocean near San
Francisco and followed in the environment (2). Whether the
development of osteomyelitis and endocarditis in Bay Area intravenous
drug users due to _S. marcescens_ [mostly in the mid-1970s but
occurring as early as 1951 (3)] had anything to do with the military
studies more than 2 decades before is not known. Yu (1) states that
covert _S. marcescens_ aerosolization studies were also done in
Alabama and Key West, Florida, at the same time as the San Francisco
studies. Again, whether this release in 1951 is at all related to
the white pox of elkhorn coral is pure speculation.
