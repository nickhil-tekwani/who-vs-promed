On 2 Feb 2022, FMD virus, serotype O, was diagnosed in samples from cattle in Kefar Yehoshua. On 24 Feb 2022, the FMDV serotype O was diagnosed in samples received from cattle in another neighboring moshav, Nahalal. The FMD laboratory of the Kimron Veterinary Institute identified the causative agent as O/ME-SA/Panasia 2/ANT. Typical clinical signs have been observed in dozens of individual cattle of various age groups in both moshavs. Photos are attached [see the source URL].

Earlier, FMDV O outbreaks were reported from cattle and sheep in several parts of the Palestinian Authority (P.A.) and from the Kingdom of Jordan [see comment].

This virus strain is not identical to the strains isolated in Israel during recent years; the matching rate of applied vaccines might be lower than required. Such a situation can lead to morbidity and the appearance of clinical signs even in fully vaccinated cattle, requiring the application of more severe bio-safety and preventive measures.

[The distance between the two affected moshavs (collective villages), which are included among the leading milk producers of Israel, is 4 km (2.5 miles, map at <tinyurl.com/ykkphjyw>).

Since April 2018 and as of early 2021, all FMD isolates from Israel were genotyped ME-SA PanAsia-2, sublineage QOM-15. Detailed results of their testings, including vaccine matching test results, from the FMDWRL (World Reference Laboratory, Pirbright) are available at https://www.wrlfmd.org/western-and-central-asia/israel#panel-7782. The sublineage of the current strain was reported from Jordan and Israel (local laboratories) as ANT.

In Kefar Yehoshua, at least 5 cattle farms (beef fattening and dairy operations), and one sheep farm have been reported as infected. In Nahalal 2 cattle farms have so far been reported as infected.

According to media reports, Jordan (likely assisted by FAO's technical project TCP/JOR/3808), the P.A. and Syria (in particular, Suwaida province, bordering Jordan), have undertaken mass FMD vaccinations. Hopefully, samples have been submitted from the 3 territories to a reference laboratory, for confirmatory genotyping and vaccine matching tests; these results are urgently needed. - Mod.AS
