Int'l bird flu meeting agrees on help to affected countries
--------------------------------------------------
An international conference on the bird flu crisis that ended in Bangkok on
Saturday reached agreements on assistance to those countries that were hit
by bird flu.
At a press briefing at the end of the 3-day meeting, United Nations Food
and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Representative Samuel Jutzi said the
meeting adopted several guidelines for countries affected by bird flu.
These included a surveillance strategy, technical advice, human issues
related to avian influenza, and regional and international collaboration.
The meeting recommended actions to be taken to stamp out the outbreak,
including the launch of national campaigns to educate the public about bird
flu, categorise standards of poultry farms, and refrain from culling wild
birds.
Jutzi said FAO had provided emergency aid worth 5.5 million USD for 6
national-scale projects and 3 trans-national projects to battle the outbreak.
FAO animal health expert Joseph Domenech said the aim of the meeting was to
build a ground to persuade other countries to give a helping hand to
affected countries. He said the World Bank (WB) will make available
hundreds of millions of dollars for a number of bird flu control programmes.
According to FAO, the bird flu outbreak could cost Asia at least half a
billion USD.
Also at the press briefing, Chief of the World Organisation for Animal
Health (OIE) Bernard Vallat said it will need hundreds of millions of US
dollars for affected countries to restore their livestock herds.
[More details on the meeting's obtained recommendations and decisions
related to the control, prevention (including vaccines and vaccination
policy), and coordinated surveillance programmes are anticipated. - Mod.AS]

[2] Japan - 3rd outbreak

Japan Confirms Bird-Flu Case; Virus May Have Spread
---------------------------------------------------
Japan ordered a farm in the western prefecture of Kyoto to slaughter all of
its chickens after the country's 3rd bird flu case was confirmed. The
infection may have spread to a neighboring prefecture, media reports said.
The Asada Nosan Funai farm in Tamba had 198 000 chickens, Japan's Ministry
of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said in a statement, confirming the
3rd outbreak of avian influenza this year. Cases in Yamaguchi and Oita
prefectures were Japan's 1st bird flu outbreaks in almost 8 decades.
Chickens at a processing plant in Hyogo Prefecture may have been
contaminated with the virus after the Kyoto farm shipped 9900 chickens
there last week, the Nihon Keizai newspaper said. The shipment was made
after more than 1000 birds died at the Tamba farm on 20 Feb 2004, an
occurrence not immediately reported to local authorities, the Nikkei said.
"That report came in late," Yoshiyuki Kamei, Japan's agriculture minister,
said in an interview aired by the NHK television. "It's regrettable the
matter was handled this way."
10 live chickens at the Hyogo processing plant sent from Okayama Prefecture
and kept with those from the flu-infected farm tested positive for avian
influenza in a preliminary examination, the Nikkei said, citing unnamed
Hyogo government officials.
Some of the birds from the infected farm were processed into soup stock and
sold this week to a restaurant in Osaka, Japan's second-largest urban area,
NHK said.
The restaurant, which wasn't named, used 8.4 kilograms of chicken bones and
meat for soup that came from the Hyogo processor, NHK said. Hyogo officials
had said that products from the processing plant were stored at
distribution facilities and not put into circulation, NHK said.
Kyoto Prefecture officials ordered the Tamba farm to dispose of its
chickens at 10 a.m. local time.
Japan's agriculture ministry said there have been no cases of humans
contracting the bird-flu virus from eating the eggs or meat of infected birds.
The ministry said earlier it identified the deadly H5N1 avian flu strain in
the Yamaguchi and Oita outbreaks -- the same virus found in Thailand,
Vietnam, China, Indonesia, South Korea, Laos, and Cambodia. The ministry
said it hasn't determined the source of the infection in Japan.
Asian nations may need at least USD 500 million in the next 3 years to
eradicate the bird-flu virus and revive the poultry industry, Samuel Jutzi,
a director at the Food and Agriculture Organization's animal production
unit, said at a Bangkok meeting.
Countries in the region have destroyed 100 million chickens and other birds
to try to eliminate the virus, which has killed 22 people in Vietnam and
Thailand.
