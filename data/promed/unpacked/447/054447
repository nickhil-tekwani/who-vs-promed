Health officials are trying to determine whether a Maui resident has contracted murine typhus, a disease carried by fleas most often on rodents or mice.

Hawaii reports 5 to 6 cases of murine typhus annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]. CDC says 47 typhus cases were identified on Maui in 2002.

The Maui News reported on Wed 11 Jun 2014 that the current potential case surfaced this week. Test results could take weeks, but the paper says in the meantime the patient is being treated with antibiotics. Symptoms of murine typhus include headaches, fever and a rash.

[There are 5 classical diseases with typhus literally or figuratively in their names: epidemic typhus, Brill-Zinsser disease (recrudescent epidemic typhus), murine typhus, scrub typhus, and typhoid (so-called because it is typhus-like). The term typhus comes from the Greek, _typhein_ -- to smoke -- which may refer to the smokey or clouded mental status that patients present with.

Murine typhus, caused by _Rickettsia typhi_, is distributed widely throughout the world, especially in the warm and humid coastal environments of tropic and subtropical climes. Although clearly endemic in Hawaii, the increased number of cases this year (2014) deserves note. In the developed world, the infection is found along the eastern coasts of south Atlantic states in the USA, the Caribbean, and Pacific coasts of the southeastern and southwest USA as well as Hawaii. In Europe, it is distributed along the Mediterranean coast as well as the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts of Africa. It is a zoonosis in which rats function as the disease's asymptomatic reservoir, and the Oriental rat flea _Xenopsylla cheopis_ is the commonest vector. Although generally coastal in distribution, the disease may well spread away from the coast via major routes of transportation. Although rickettsia-infected flea feces being rubbed into a flea bite appears to be the major vehicle of transmission to humans, flea bites themselves and aerosolization of flea feces may transmit infection as well.

Murine typhus is a relatively mild disease. Among patients admitted to an acute care hospital with this disease, only 10 per cent require an intensive care unit setting, and only 1-4 per cent die.

Tetracyclines appear to remain the drug of choice in treatment. - Mod.LL
