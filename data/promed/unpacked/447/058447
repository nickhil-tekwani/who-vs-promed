African swine fever, Grodno, Belarus
------------------------------------
Belarus has confirmed African swine fever. The State Veterinary Service of Belarus has recorded African swine fever (ASF) in the Grodno region, close to the Polish border. The information is given in a statement dated 21 Jun 2013 on the website of the Russian Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance, Rosselkhoznadzor (http://www.fsvps.ru/fsvps/news/6853.html). Russia has introduced temporary restrictions on imports of live pigs, boar semen, pork and raw pork meat, pork products, and animal feed.

Rosselkhoznadzor is ready to provide veterinary services and necessary assistance to Belarus.

Ukraine has banned the import of pigs and pork from Belarus starting from 22 Jun 2013 after African swine fever (ASF) was reported in this country.

Ukraine introduced the ban having received an official report by the Veterinary Services of Belarus about an outbreak of African swine fever in the Grodno region of the country, the State Veterinary and Biosecurity Service of Ukraine reported on Saturday [22 Jun 2013].

The embargo also applies to fodder for pigs and genetic material.

[In February 2012, ASF was suspected in a Belarusian village in Neznanova village, Novogrudok district, Grodno, when mass destruction of pigs was performed. However, no official confirmation was obtained (see ProMED-mail archive no 20120305.1061612). At that time, the Ukrainian Veterinary Services banned imports from Belarus, stating that "Belarus is a member of the Customs Union, which implies the absence of customs and veterinary controls when passing the Russian border, where a difficult situation with ASF has been seen for the past 5 years, and taking into consideration the large number of ASF outbreaks in the central federal area of Russia (near the border with Belarus), there is a chance that the case in Neznanova is linked to an outbreak of ASF in Belarus."

Later, media reports from Belarus included conflicting pieces of information; one report reported diagnosed PRRS (porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome/blue ear disease) on farms in the Brest district (south of Grodno, similarly bordering Poland). The Department of Veterinary and Food Control of the Belarusian Ministry of Agriculture refuted the information published in a series of media reports about the dissemination of dangerous infectious diseases in one of the pig complexes near Baranovichi (Brest area).

ASF has been spreading in the European parts of the Russian Federation since 2009. Recently, the Russians reported 17 new outbreaks, including an infected wild boar in the Smolensk oblast, bordering Belarus (ProMED-mail posting 20130618.1779904).

An official notification to the OIE may be expected early next week. - Mod.AS
