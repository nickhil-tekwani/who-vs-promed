"The 1st line of defense against avian influenza is the early detection of disease outbreaks followed by a rapid response. This is strongly linked to a high level of awareness among veterinarians and animal owners, and high quality Veterinary Services. Putting in place accurate warning systems as well as prevention measures is essential as part of an effective strategy to prevent and control avian influenza. This needs to be coupled with similar efforts placed on preparing for a potential outbreak." (http://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/web-portal-on-avian-influenza/early-detection-warning-diagnostic-confirmation/)
