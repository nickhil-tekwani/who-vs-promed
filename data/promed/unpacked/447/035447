UN refugee agency warns of potential polio cases in Ethiopian camps
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The United Nations refugee agency [UNHCR] today [24 Jan 2012] voiced its concern over reports of 2 suspected polio cases this week among Somali refugees living in camps in Ethiopia and 3 cases in the surrounding community.

"The immediate priority is to confirm the outbreak, and samples have been collected and sent to Addis Ababa for laboratory confirmation," said spokesperson for the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Melissa Fleming at a press briefing in Geneva.

Ms Fleming said UNHCR is working closely with the Ethiopian ministry of health, the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), and other health partners to coordinate the response in the 5 refugee camps in Dollo Ado, where the cases were reported. The immediate priority is to confirm the outbreak, and samples have been collected and sent to Addis Ababa for laboratory confirmation.

"Once the strain of virus is identified, the appropriate vaccine will be dispatched to Dollo Ado for a mass vaccination campaign in the camps and surrounding communities," she said.

In addition, a nationwide anti-polio campaign is scheduled to start on [27 Jan 2012] and will be expanded to include all refugee camps.

A highly infectious disease caused by a virus, polio invades the nervous system and leads to irreversible paralysis in one out of 200 cases. Only 3 countries -- Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan -- remain polio-endemic today, and the number of cases has declined drastically in the past 25 years.

Ms Fleming stressed that UNHCR and other agencies have strengthened its surveillance to identify other potential polio cases. "At community level, mobilization and sensitization efforts have been stepped up to increase awareness of the signs and symptoms of polio and ways to prevent transmission.

"As the polio virus is transmitted through contaminated food and water, our partners providing water and sanitation are being engaged to ensure delivery of adequate services," she added.

According to UNHCR, some 143 000 Somalis are currently sheltered in 5 Ethiopian camps in Dollo Ado, which is now the 2nd largest refugee settlement in the Horn of Africa. Almost one million Somalis live as refugees in the region while another 1.36 million are internally displaced.

[The suspected cases of polio mentioned above, if confirmed, are the 1st identified polio cases reported in 2012. Of note, during 2011, there were no cases of polio associated with wild poliovirus (WPV) infection reported from either Somalia or Ethiopia (see summary table of 2011 cases available from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative webiste at http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek.aspx).

If confirmed, it will be important to see the results of genetic testing to determine the most likely origin of the WPV(s) involved. The only confirmed case of WPV associated paralysis in the Horn of Africa during 2011 was a single case with date of onset 30 Jul 2011, in Kenya. As the WPV involved in that case in Kenya was closely related to a virus that had been circulating in Uganda's Bugiri District in 2010 (see prior ProMED-mail post Poliomyelitis - worldwide (13): Kenya, China, Pakistan 20110920.2860), concern re: silent transmission in the region was raised. Of note is the location of Dolo Ado (?alternative spelling from that in the newswire above)-- in the south of Ethiopia just by the border with Kenya. It can be seen on a map of Ethiopia showing the location of refugee camps, at http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/page?page=49e483986.

While the newswire above does not include India as an endemic country for polio, the official information available on the Polio Eradication Initiative website states: "India has not had a case of wild poliovirus nor detected the virus in sewage sampling since [13 Jan 2011]. When all pending samples have cleared laboratory testing, India will be considered to have interrupted transmission of indigenous wild poliovirus."

More information on results of further investigations into the suspected cases of polio would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP
