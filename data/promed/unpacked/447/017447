Ralstonia associated with Vapotherm oxygen delivery device - USA, 2005
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In Aug 2005, a health care facility in Pennsylvania reported the
occurrence of _Ralstonia spp._ in 6 patients aged 21 days to 8 years
to the Philadelphia Department of Health and CDC.
Preliminary laboratory and epidemiologic investigation identified the
Vapotherm 2000i oxygen delivery device (Vapotherm Inc., Stevensville,
MD, USA) as an associated risk factor for recovery of the organism
from blood and respiratory tract samples. Although the source of
_Ralstonia_ has not yet been identified, Vapotherm has created new
infection-control procedures to reduce the risk for infectious
disease transmission among patients using their machines. This report
summarizes the initial results of this ongoing investigation and
provides recommendations to prevent further spread of _Ralstonia_
species in hospitals.
The Vapotherm device is capable of delivering high concentrations of
medical gases, such as oxygen, via nasal cannula. Breathing gas is
distributed alongside a discrete water chamber, where it is warmed
and humidified and then delivered to the patient. The machine employs
a reusable 0.01 micron cartridge filter, which should prevent passage
of bacterial microorganisms from the water chamber to the air
compartment. Approximately 4 500 Vapotherm units are in service in the USA.
_Ralstonia_ species are Gram negative bacilli that grow well in moist
environments and are an infrequent cause of colonization and
infection in humans. Although ubiquitous in the environment, the
organism is rarely found in hospitals. _Ralstonia spp._ have
traditionally exhibited low virulence in humans but have been
implicated in several nosocomial outbreaks involving contaminated
solutions (1-3).
Surveillance performed through pediatric and neonatology electronic
mail listserv groups identified 10 hospitals in 7 states that have
recovered_Ralstonia_ species from clinical specimens and/or Vapotherm
devices. During Jan-Sep 2005, a total of 18 pediatric patients with
positive _Ralstonia_ respiratory or blood cultures were reported from
5 hospitals in 5 states. Investigations to determine which cases
represent infections (as opposed to colonization) are ongoing. 17 of
these patients were exposed to a Vapotherm system before culture
specimens were obtained. 4 of the 10 hospitals cultured the organism
from Vapotherm systems and reusable filter cartridges after they had
been disinfected according to the manufacturer's previously
recommended reprocessing protocol. Whether the remaining 6 hospitals
followed Vapotherm's recommended reprocessing protocol is unclear.
Failure to reprocess the system properly might have allowed
development of a biofilm, which the previous reprocessing protocol
did not address.
In response to this investigation, Vapotherm has developed new
infection-control guidelines. Vapotherm continues to recommend that
machines be reprocessed after each patient use or every 30 days if a
single patient uses the device. Furthermore, the company now advises
that each filter cartridge either be used for a single patient or be
subjected to the new high-level disinfection reprocessing protocol.
Moreover, the suggested maximum service life of the filter cartridge
now is 60 cumulative days. Finally, Vapotherm now recommends use of
sterile water in the delivery circuit, instead of following previous
guidelines, which allowed use of tap water.
CDC recommends that users of the Vapotherm device follow the
manufacturer's recommendations. More information on the new
reprocessing protocol is available at
<http://www.vtherm.com/customers/infectioncontrol.asp>. CDC also
encourages health-care facilities to adhere to strict
infection-control practices while administering respiratory therapy
to prevent transmission of organisms such as _Ralstonia spp._ that
thrive in warm,moist environments. Information on appropriate
infection-control procedures is available at

[Whether disease was caused by the _Ralstonia_ bacteria in these
individuals is not stated which suggests that the organism was only
colonizing the respiratory tract of those involved.
The genus includes some organisms that had previously part of
_Pseudomonas_, _Alcaligenes_ and _Cupriavidus_. The genus is also
one, like _Burkholderia_, that contains organisms that may cause
human disease and others that are related to diseases in plants.
_R. pickettii_ has been associated with nosocomial outbreaks caused
by cotaminated aqueous solutions as well as "pseudoepidemics" related
to cotaminated solutions in a diagnostic laboratory. Other
_Ralstonia_ species such as _mannitolilytica_ and _insidiosa_ have
also been linked to human infection (1, 2).
_R. solanacearum_ is a cause of common bacterial wilt in geraniums
and affects a number of solanaceneous plants such as tomatoes,
eggplant and peppers. It is also a problem in the potato industry
and can be harbored by a number of plants without causing disease.
_R. solanacearum_ is not known to cause disease in man.
The nightshades (Family Solanaceae) are a family of dicots, many of
which are edible, while others are considered poisonous. The name of
the family comes from the Latin solanum "nightshade," but the further
etymology of that word is unclear; it has been suggested it
originates from the Latin verb "solari," meaning "soothing." This
would presumably refer to alleged soothing pharmacological properties
of some of the psychoactive species found in the family. It is more
likely, however, that the name comes from the perceived resemblance
that some of the flowers bear to the sun and its rays. The term is
also sometimes informally referred to as the potato family. The
family includes the Datura or Jimson weed, eggplant, mandrake, deadly
nightshade or belladonna, capsicum (paprika, chile pepper), potato,
tobacco, tomato, and petunia. The Solanaceae family is
characteristically ethnobotanical, that is, extensively utilized by
humans. It is an important source of food, spice, and medicine.
However, Solanaceae species are often rich in alkaloidal glucosides
that can range in their toxicity to humans and animals from mildly
irritating to fatal in small quantities.
