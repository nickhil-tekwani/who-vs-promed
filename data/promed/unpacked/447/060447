Dengue fever in Dhaka - update
-------------------------------
As of July 27, dengue has claimed 12 lives in Dhaka, Bangladesh and two
more elsewhere in the country. However, the Health Department maintains
that so far the dengue death toll is only 7. The government has shut down
all educational institutions for 3 days to stop the spread of the disease.
The widely circulated Daily Janakantha reports that the disease has now
spread to other cities including Chittagong, Rajshahi, Mymensingh, Faridpur
and Narail. Quoting several experts, the leading daily Ittefaq reports that
on Thursday (July 27) alone 50% of more than 100 patients who came to
various hospitals in the city had symptoms of dengue. The Dhaka City
Corporation has undertaken an intensive programme to control the _Aedes_
mosquitoes. The DCC authority is considering aerial spraying to control the
_Aedes_ populations quickly. The Mayor of the City is personally
supervising the mosquito control operation. Due to the City Corporation's
timely media campaign and vigorous public awareness initiatives, it seems
that the general public has taken the _Aedes_ mosquito control activities
more seriously. A number of schools and colleges have already started
anti-mosquito campaigns. The City Corporation has undertaken a programme to
enlist the service of Boy Scouts. The Health Department has already started
a programme to train 100 doctors about the management of dengue patients.
The semantic wrangling over the meaning of words like 'epidemic',
'outbreak', etc. is still going on in full swing between journalists and
officials.
Meanwhile, there is not much up to date information available about the
population density of _Aedes spp. _in the city. To estimate the _Aedes_
population density in the city, Dr. M. Ismail Hossain, Department of
Zoology, University of Dhaka and Dr. Manjur A. Chowdhury, Safeway Pest
Control have undertaken a city-wide survey. Two teams of entomology
students are now surveying homes in Dhaka to estimate the density of
_Aedes_ mosquitoes. The survey will continue for about 6 more days covering
most parts of the city. Despite the assurances from high officials and
community leaders, the entire city is still in the grip of a grim fear of a
disease they knew very little about only 3 weeks ago.
