Nearly 400 inmates have been quarantined after a mumps outbreak at Men's Central Jail, LA [Los Angeles] County sheriff's officials said.

The outbreak has infected 18 people in the jail since 22 Oct 2019, when at least one inmate unaware he was infected with the virus was housed at the jail, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which runs the lockup. The inmate showed flu-like symptoms and had swollen glands around his neck.

Authorities are still investigating the source of the outbreak, which originated on the 3rd floor of the jail in downtown Los Angeles. Inmates on that floor and the 2nd floor are being quarantined. Inmates who are infected with the virus are being housed in the medical ward on the 7th floor.

The inmates will be quarantined until at least 21 Nov [2019], a date that may be extended if new cases are diagnosed.

"We're taking it day by day," said Capt. Jason Wolak, who oversees operations at the jail.

Since the outbreak, about 350 of the quarantined inmates and 200 jail staff members have been vaccinated for measles, mumps, and rubella [MMR]. 3 staff members are under medical observation, though it's unclear if any are infected.

Through mid-October [2019], there were 2618 reported mumps infections nationwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The virus can be transmitted through physical contact, sharing drinks and utensils, or touching surfaces that have also been touched by someone infected.

Although quarantined inmates can't attend court proceedings, they still can have contact with their attorneys, the Sheriff's Department said.

[It is difficult to control mumps in prisons because of crowded conditions, which brings inmates in close contact with each other. Furthermore, "in the jail inmate population, medical histories are considered poor and inmate contact tracking is complicated. Thus, the infectious period, used to identify contacts of cases for quarantine, was defined as 5 days prior to symptom onset and 9 days following.

The General Recommendations for the prison in the situation of an outbreak are:
- Inmates or staff with visible or reported symptoms should be immediately referred to health services.
- An inmate with symptoms of mumps should be isolated for at least 9 days after the onset of symptoms or until infection is ruled out;
- Staff with symptoms of mumps should be excluded from the workplace for at least 9 days from onset of symptoms or until infection is ruled out;
- Exposed inmates should be quarantined until 25 days have passed after the last date of exposure;
- Any staff member who had close contact with an individual diagnosed with mumps during the 7 days prior to symptom onset should not work with unexposed staff or inmates for a full 25 days.
- Who should be vaccinated with one dose of MMR vaccine: inmates quarantined due to exposure; any staff who will work with quarantined or isolated inmates; any trustees or staff who visited a quarantined area during the probable exposure or communicable period.
- As few personnel as possible should be assigned to cover quarantined areas.
- If the transfer of a quarantined inmate is necessary, the inmate should be transferred alone and should immediately enter quarantine upon arrival at the new facility.
- Exposed inmates can be released to the community but household immunizations are recommended."

Three unrelated people at 3 different high school campuses in the county recently tested positive for mumps and may have exposed others to the contagious virus, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today [29 Oct 2019].

[See source URL above for locations and dates of potential exposures to mumps]

Students, teachers, and staff who attended these schools on these dates are encouraged to be on the lookout for symptoms of mumps, which could begin to show as early as 12 days after exposure through 25 days after exposure.

"We are working closely with school officials to inform the school communities about the symptoms of mumps and vaccine recommendations," said Wilma Wooten, MD, MPH, County public health officer. "Because there is no prevention after exposure for mumps, people should be watching for symptoms and make sure they have all the recommended doses of measles, mumps and rubella immunizations."

Mumps cases increase
--------------------
To date, a total of 47 mumps cases have been reported in San Diego County in 2019, the highest number in the past 25 years.

In the United States, the 2701 [2618; see https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/outbreaks.html] mumps cases reported so far in 2019 are already greater than the 2612 cases recorded in 2018, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Over 6000 cases were reported nationally in 2016 and in 2017.

In California, 157 mumps cases have been reported this year [2019], 52 more cases than at the same time in 2018. Furthermore, according to the Mexican Ministry of Health, Baja California is also experiencing an increased number of mumps cases. Through 12 Oct 2019, a total of 654 mumps cases had been reported in the Mexican state, 292 more than the 362 mumps cases reported in 2018.

What is mumps?
--------------
Mumps is a highly contagious viral disease. It is spread by coughing, sneezing, or close contact with an infected person. Mumps causes a fever, headache, earache, and inflammation of the salivary glands which results in swelling and tenderness at the angle of the jaw. Anyone who thinks that they have mumps should contact their provider before going for care so proper precautions can be taken to prevent exposure to others.

Severe complications are rare but can include meningitis, decreased fertility, permanent hearing loss, and, in extreme cases, fetal loss during 1st trimester of pregnancy. There is no treatment for mumps. Most people recover without problems.

Mumps, a viral infection for which there is no treatment, has been reported at the York County Prison within the last several weeks.

The prison's medical provider works with the Pennsylvania Department of Health in treating and managing illnesses, such as mumps, chickenpox, and other infections, said Mark Walters, a spokesman for the County of York.

A state Department of Health investigation started in the beginning of September [2018], according to Brittany Lauffer, a spokeswoman for the agency.

The last case that was investigated was in early October [2019], she said in an email. No additional cases have been reported since then. The prison vaccinated exposed contacts at the beginning of October, she said.

The assistance from the state should end in about 2 weeks, Walters said.

Students from the UCLouvain [Catholic University of Leuven] have received an email warning of increased cases of mumps on the campus of Sint-Lambrechts-Woluwe and in the colleges in the municipality [of Brussels-Capital Region].

This information -- widely reported in Belgium -- was confirmed by the spokesperson for the University Isabelle Decoster to Belga.

The total number of infected is currently not known as students can go to doctors across the city. Sick students are asked to stay at home.
