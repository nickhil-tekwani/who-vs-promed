Philippines: dengue fever alert
-------------------------------
The Department of Health on Mon 9 Jun 2003 warned Filipinos about the
increasing incidence of dengue fever in the country with the onset of the
rainy season. At a press briefing on Monday, health secretary Manuel Dayrit
said that Filipinos must guard against the disease, especially since at
least 4026 cases have been reported since 2 Jun 2002. This figure, he said,
is 61 per cent higher than the number in the same period last year. The
government also confirmed 54 dengue-related deaths. Last year, the health
department recorded 12 670 dengue cases nationwide, including 153 deaths.
The victims' ages range from one month to 87. Forty-eight per cent of the
cases were aged 1 to 9 years. A case fatality ratio of one per cent was
noted among age groups less than one year and 1 to 9 years.
The regions with the most cases were Metro Manila (875), Central Visayas
(752), and Northern Mindanao (634), although no hot spots or outbreaks have
yet been observed. Clustering of cases, however, was noted in Pinagbuhatan,
Pasig.
