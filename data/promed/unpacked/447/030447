An investigation is currently under way to explain an outbreak of
foodborne botulism in Scotland. Three children in the same family were
confirmed as having botulism following consumption of a meal made with
a jar of korma sauce. Residual sauce from the jar, the jar lid, and a
remnant of the meal all tested positive for _Clostridium botulinum_
type A toxin. The children are recovering, although 2 remain
ventilated and in intensive care unit.

Case description
----------------
In early November 2011, on consecutive days, 2 siblings were admitted
to hospital in Scotland with botulism diagnosed on the basis of
clinical symptoms. Both children had initial symptoms of blurred
vision followed by difficulty in swallowing and a descending
paralysis. Both children were ventilated and trivalent botulinum
antitoxin was administered, after which their condition remained
stable. 6 days after the first child was admitted to hospital, a 3rd
younger sibling became unwell and deteriorated over the course of the
next day. A day later, the child began to choke while trying to
swallow liquids. This sibling was also hospitalised with a suspected
diagnosis of botulism. Trivalent antitoxin was administered, and the
child was discharged from hospital 6 days after admission.

Epidemiological investigation
-----------------------------
The local public health team, supported by the local authority, Food
Standards Agency, Health Protection Scotland, and the Health
Protection Agency (HPA) carried out an intensive investigation
including a comprehensive food history for the 3 days prior to symptom
onset (with particular emphasis on the previous 36 hours). Korma
sauce, a mild curry sauce with a blend of cream, coconut and almonds,
was one of the many foods reported in the food history. The korma
sauce that had been served during a family meal 2 days before the 1st
sibling was admitted to hospital, had been eaten by the 2 elder
siblings, and tasted by the 3rd sibling and the father (but not the
mother). The sauce in question was a commercially prepared food
product distributed in the UK and Ireland.

Microbiological and toxicological investigation
-----------------------------------------------
Clinical specimens (serum, rectal washouts, and gastric aspirates) and
environmental samples taken from the children’s home were examined
for _Clostridium botulinum_ and botulinum neurotoxin by the Foodborne
Pathogens Reference Unit, HPA. Environmental samples from the
family’s rubbish bins and recycling boxes were taken. These included
the remains of food items, used jars, and containers with remnants of
a number of foods, suspected on the basis of previous incidents and
biological plausibility.

Botulinum neurotoxin was detected in the two older siblings’ sera by
a neutralization mouse bioassay (MBA) [1] 4 days after the first
sibling was hospitalized. _C. botulinum_ type A was detected and
subsequently isolated from their rectal washouts confirming a
diagnosis of botulism. A day later, _C. botulinum_ type A toxin was
detected by MBA in residual sauce present in the empty used glass jar
from a recycling box, its lid from a rubbish bin, and remnant of a
chicken and korma sauce meal (which had been spat out by 1 of the 2
siblings and wrapped in tissue). 7 days after the third younger
sibling was admitted to hospital, _C. botulinum_ type A was detected
in the latter’s stool specimen by MBA and subsequently isolated,
confirming a diagnosis of botulism.

All other items from the rubbish bin and recycling box that were
tested were negative for botulinum neurotoxin.

Control measures
----------------
The implicated batch of korma sauce which had been distributed across
the UK and Ireland was withdrawn from sale [2]. Consumers were warned
not to eat sauce from this batch. Warnings were also issued to the
public and to medical professionals about the signs and symptoms of
botulism [3]. Similar warnings were issued throughout the rest of the
UK and Europe, via the Early Warning Response System (EWRS) and the
Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF). Emergency procedures
were put in place to ensure that clinicians could obtain botulinum
antitoxin if required.

Exhaustive investigations of production and distribution of the korma
sauce are continuing, but at present there is no indication of how the
jar became contaminated, nor any evidence that any other jars of korma
sauce from the same batch were contaminated. This product was not
available on retail sale outside the UK and Ireland.

Conclusions
-----------
Foodborne botulism caused by _C. botulinum_ is very rare in the UK.
Since 1922 there have only been 17 recorded incidents in the UK, the
largest of which was a general outbreak in 1989 affecting 27 people,
caused by a contaminated batch of commercially produced hazelnut
yoghurt [4]. Between 1998 and 2006, 7 incidents of foodborne botulism,
(one household cluster of 2 cases, and 6 apparently sporadic cases)
were reported in the UK, with home-preserved food sourced outside the
UK responsible for most (4/7 incidents) (Kathie Grant, personal
communication, November 2011) [4].

In early November 2011, 3 cases of botulism occurred in a household,
due to the consumption of korma sauce. The outbreak was investigated
and managed by a multidisciplinary team, which through an
epidemiological link and subsequent microbiological confirmation
successfully identified the korma sauce as the vehicle of
intoxication. Only family members who had tasted or eaten the sauce
became ill. The father, who had only tasted the sauce, and the mother
who had neither eaten nor tasted it remained well. No other cases have
been reported elsewhere to date. Investigations are continuing into
the source and cause of the contamination.

[It remains interesting that only a single jar of the curry sauce has
been implicated in being a vehicle for botulism. This observation
might lead one to consider that the storage of the container was
suboptimal and this may have led to enough growth of the botulinum
bacillus to lead to toxin production. - Mod.LL]
