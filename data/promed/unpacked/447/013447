Stakes high in fight against the cattle fever tick; pest could spread
coast-to-coast
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Livestock health officials say it could cost upwards of USD 13
million and take as long as 2 years to stop an incursion of fever
ticks into the formerly fever tick-free areas of 5 counties along the
Texas-Mexico border. The fever tick, less than a 1/8-inch (3 mm)
long, is capable of carrying and transmitting 'babesia,' a blood
parasite deadly to cattle.
"For most of the country, the fever tick has been pushed out of
sight, out of mind, since the 1940s. This tick, however, is capable
of transmitting a foreign animal disease and it's sitting in our
backyard," said Dr. Bob Hillman, Texas' state veterinarian and
executive director of the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC), the
state's livestock and poultry health regulatory agency.
"If we do not stop it, the fever tick could spread from coast to
coast, except the arid lands of New Mexico and Arizona, and as far
north as Washington D.C.," stressed Dr. Hillman. "As the tick spreads
so will the need for personnel and resources. Win the battle along
the Rio Grande in Texas, and other states won't have to fight the war."
The TAHC has placed temporary fever tick quarantines on 1116.3 square
miles (2891.2 sq km) in 5 Texas border counties, including parts of
Starr and Zapata counties, and a contiguous area encompassing parts
of Maverick, Dimmit, and Webb Counties. In addition, an 852-square
mile (2207 sq km) permanent quarantine zone butts up against the Rio
Grande from Del Rio to Brownsville and is under the management of the
US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) 60-person Fever Tick Force.
The USDA, which is adding up to 30 temporary tick inspectors, and the
TAHC, which has detailed inspectors to south Texas on a rotating
basis, are working with ranchers to locate, 'corral,' and eradicate
the tick. In this area about the size of Delaware, all cattle,
horses, penned deer, llamas, camels, and any other species that can
host the tick are being manually inspected -- or "scratched" -- by
TAHC or USDA inspectors.
If animals in these quarantined areas are moved from their premises,
they'll undergo another "scratch" inspection, then be dipped or
sprayed, and permitted for movement. Because horses can give ticks a
lift, these animals are put under 14-day inspections and treatment,
if they're moved routinely from their home base.
When fever tick-infested livestock are detected, the premises are
quarantined for 6 to 9 months. As of early October [2007], this
included at least 25 premises in the temporary quarantine areas and
about 56 premises in the permanent quarantine zone.
Cattle remaining on tick-infested premises must be inspected and
dipped every 14 days or treated with doramectin every 28 days.
Alternatively, the animals may be moved to a new site, but only after
undergoing 2 consecutive tick-free inspections and dippings. A
movement permit then is issued, and the cattle must be transported immediately.
"The USDA has made USD 340 000 available for immediate fever tick
needs in south Texas, and the state legislature granted the TAHC an
extra USD 150 000 to purchase additional Co-Ral, the acaricide used
for dipping vats and in spray rigs," Dr. Hillman said. He reported
that a USDA assessment concluded that to eliminate fever ticks from
the temporary preventive quarantine areas, at least USD 13 million
was needed to hire additional personnel, repair or replace worn out
portable tick dipping equipment, purchase new spray rigs and
supplies, and procure other essential equipment.
"To get a handle on potential fever tick spread, the TAHC field staff
also is tracing the movement of cattle from infested premises in the
temporary quarantine area within the past year," Dr. Hillman noted.
So far, this has involved nearly 800 animals, of which about 459 have
been located, inspected, and found to be fever tick-free. Some were
found in Kansas or Texas Panhandle feed yards, and others were
scattered across the state and to 2 other states.
"Many of these animals had been moved as calves without any
identification, except the livestock market back tag, or clearly
defined destination," he said. "This slows down our work, but we
don't give up until all avenues are exhausted."
"The fever tick, by itself, will not cause disease. However, cattle
tick fever is imminent if the fever tick is carrying babesia, and
transmits it to cattle that are 'naive,' meaning they have no
resistance to the organism that quickly breaks down red blood cells,"
said Dr. Hillman. "There are 2 potential scenarios with fever ticks
that keep the TAHC, the Tick Force, and border ranchers awake at night."
The 1st scenario, explained Dr. Hillman, involves Mexico, where fever
ticks and babesia have not been eradicated. Young calves there may be
exposed to the babesia, survive the disease and develop immunity, but
continue to carry the organism.
"Even if Mexican feeder cattle carry babesia, they will not cause a
disease problem unless there is fever tick involvement," said Dr.
Hillman, setting the scene for the scenario. "Mexican-origin feeder
cattle enter the US under strict USDA fever tick inspection and
dipping requirements. To keep them away from fever ticks, the TAHC
requires Mexican-imported cattle to have an "M" branded on their hip
and prohibits these animals from being maintained in the permanent
quarantine zone."
"If fever ticks are moved to sites where Mexican feeder cattle are
pastured, the pests may pick up babesia. The babesia infected female
tick transmits the disease to the next generation of fever ticks.
Only one element then would be missing from the dangerous disease
equation: US cattle with no immunity to the babesia," noted Dr.
Hillman. "If native US cattle, which are susceptible to babesiosis or
'cattle tick fever,' are infested with babesia-infected fever ticks,
then disease transmission to the native cattle will occur. Most
likely, this will cause significant death loss of native cattle. It's
crucial to keep the fever tick pushed beyond the border, and support
and fund surveillance activities in the permanent fever tick quarantine zone."
Dr. Hillman said the 2nd scenario involves wildlife as effective
alternative hosts and sources for movement of ticks into Texas from
Mexico and from the permanent quarantine zone to the free area of
Texas. For once, noted Dr. Hillman, the beleaguered feral (wild) hog
is not implicated. Fever ticks have not acclimated to swine, goats,
sheep, or dogs. On the other hand, elk, white-tailed deer, nilgai,
and red deer, serve as effective hosts for fever ticks, but are not
affected by babesia.
"Free-ranging cervids do not respect national borders, shallow
rivers, low fences, quarantines, or permits for movement," he said.
"Wildlife hosts may crisscross the Rio Grande, hauling in fever
ticks. Right now, wildlife presents the greatest risk for fever tick movement."
In spring 2007, more than 30 nilgai were depopulated in the Lower Rio
Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge, due to fever tick
infestation. Of the 42 free-ranging white-tailed deer that were
trapped and examined this year [2007], 28 also were "ticky."
"Treating wildlife is a tricky proposition, because current methods
are limited to feeding cervids ivormectin-treated corn or drawing
them to '4-poster' stations where they rub against pyrethrin-treated
posts, which transfers the chemical," he said. "Ivormectin use
requires a 60-day withholding period prior to slaughter or harvest,
so wildlife feeding treatments will be delayed until hunting season ends."
In the meantime, the USDA or TAHC must inspect, treat, and permit the
movement of hides from deer or exotic hoof stock harvested on
tick-infested or exposed premises. (Meat may be moved without
inspection.) To avoid the possibility of transporting fever ticks,
ranchers and hunters are urged to practice good sanitary measures
when leaving a ranch. Brush off clothing to dislodge any ticks that
may be on the fabric. Clean off boots and shake out jackets or items
that have been on the ground.
"The fever tick is not a human health threat," said Dr. Hillman. "But
be careful. Don't transport ticks to new sites. Getting and keeping
the fever tick out of Texas and the US is critical for disease
control and our continued ability to move livestock without restrictions."
"If we are ultimately to be successful in our battle against the
fever tick and 'cattle tick fever,' we must eliminate the current
fever tick incursions in the free areas of Texas, then push the pest
back into Mexico. To accomplish this, we must acquire resources
necessary to fulfill the long-range fever tick eradication plan, fund
research, and develop additional treatment products and methods. We
also must aid our Mexican neighbors in their fight against the fever
tick and 'cattle tick fever,'" concluded Dr. Hillman.

[The fact that the quarantine zone has expanded with ticks being
found is significant. In the early 1900's this represented a
significant economic impact as it was wide spread and was years
before it was under control. The possibility of this spreading again
and having economic impact is frightening; enough that USDA has
detailed help to Texas.
Bovine babesiosis is a major tick-borne disease of cattle caused by
protozoan parasites (_Babesia_ spp). The parasite is usually
transmitted by the _Boophilus_ spp. tick.
Cattle with advanced babesiosis have a low exercise tolerance and
sometimes collapse and die while being moved. Generally, older
animals are more acutely affected and animals younger than 6 months
rarely demonstrate clinical signs. Abortions may occur when pregnant
animals are severely affected. 2 organisms carried by ticks cause
similar clinical signs. However, the course of the disease differs
markedly. Clinical signs include, fever, anorexia, depression,
increased respiratory rate particularly following exertion, muscle
tremor, reluctance to move, hemoglobinuria, and occasionally
neurological signs such as head pressing, circling, and convulsions.
While these signs are seen very early in the course of _Babesia
bovis_ infections, they only develop in _Babesia bigemina_ infections
in the latter stages when there is advanced parasitemia. Anemia and
jaundice develop steadily with _B. bovis_ but they are much more
precipitous with _B. bigemina_. Animals affected with _B. bigemina_
may exhibit irritability and aggression but not the central nervous
system signs.
Findings on necropsy my be variable but could include varying degrees
of congestion, pallor or jaundice, red urine, blood that seems watery
or thin, sub-serosal hemorrhages -- especially in the heart and
intestines --, an enlarged pulpy red spleen, and an enlarged, brown
or yellow liver with the gall bladder filled with thick, granular bile.
Differential diagnosis should include other causes of hemolytic
anemia such as anaplasmosis, leptospirosis, and chronic copper poisoning.
The best treatment is prevention with insecticides. - Mod.TG]
