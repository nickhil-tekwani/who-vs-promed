Mosquito vectors of Japanese encephalitis virus - RFI
-----------------------------------------------------
With regards to the undiagnosed febrile illness in Uttar Pradesh [see
ProMED-mail references below], I was wondering if anyone would like to
comment on the possibility that it may be too early to rule out Japanese
encephalitis virus (JEV), based on the inability to find any _Culex
vishnui_ mosquitoes in the area, when there are other species that have
also been implicated in the transmission of JEV (see the quotations and
reference below).

I am no entomological expert (but it is an area of some interest to me), so
I cannot comment on the epidemiology or even the transmissibility of JEV in
the species mentioned below. I am curious to know whether any other readers
out there have knowledge of confirmed JEV transmission in India by other
mosquito species.

The following information is taken from "Illustrated keys to species Of
_Culex_ associated with Japanese encephalitis in southeast Asia (_Diptera_:
_Culicidae_)", R Reuben, SC Tewari, J Hiriyan, J Akiyama. Mosquito
Systematics 1994; 26:75-96 <http://wrbu.si.edu/www/ms/26/ms26n02p075.pdf>.

"A single isolation of JEV has been made in India from a third species,
_Culex epidesmus Theobald_ (Banerjee, et al. 1979), which appears to be
seasonally common in parts of the northern state, Uttar Pradesh (RS Soman,
personal communication), where JE epidemics occur. It possesses a
distinctive apical pale area on the wing, and the apical abdominal terga
are largely golden-yellow."

"2 species are common throughout the region [SE Asia], _Cx.
bitaeniorhynchus Giles_ and _Cx. infula Theobald_. There have been two
isolations of JEV in nature from the former in India (Rodrigues, 1988), and
the species feeds extensively on birds and pigs as well as on man
(Christopher and Reuben, 1971). It could, therefore, play an important role
locally."
