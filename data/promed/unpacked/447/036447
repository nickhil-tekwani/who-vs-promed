Infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) has been confirmed at a sea-based site run by Norway Royal Salmon (NRS) in the north Norwegian region of Finnmark.

The Norwegian Food Safety Authority is reporting the outbreak at Lille Kufjord, some 800 miles northeast of Oslo; it is based on the positive analysis of tests taken at the farm a few days earlier.

The authority said it has also informed its Danish counterpart. No reason for this move has been given, but presumably it is because some of the fish from the farm is sent to Denmark.

The authority adds: "In order to prevent the spread of the infection, the site is now subject to a number of restrictions, including prohibiting the movement or relocation of fish without special permission".

The Food Safety Authority has also warned that it may impose an order to empty the farm. It seems that NRS had reported its suspicions 3 weeks previously.

The statement said: "The Norwegian Food Safety Authority has confirmed the diagnosis on the basis of histopathological changes compatible with infectious salmon anaemia, as well as detection of viruses based on 2 different methods, immunohistochemistry and PCR, done at the Veterinary Institute. A new control area will be established within a short period of time to prevent, limit and fight the ISA."

This is at least the 3rd ISA report from Northern Norway in less than a month. A case was confirmed at a SalMar-operated site in Troms county at the end of November [2019], with the state broadcaster NRK saying that up to 170 000 salmon may have to be slaughtered.

An earlier outbreak was reported at a Mowi site in Rogoland district.

[Infectious salmon anemia (ISA) is a disease of Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) caused by an orthomyxovirus and affects mainly fish maintained in marine water or exposed to the sea. The disease can be systemic and lethal, characterized by severe anemia and hemorrhage in several organs.

It is a disease of great economic impact for the salmon industry. The disease is of obligatory notification to the OIE. - Mod.PMB
