New Zealand will roll out a nationwide program to test dairy farms for the cattle disease [caused by] _Mycoplasma bovis_ as the number of affected properties steadily grows, the Ministry for Primary Industries said on [Fri 5 Jan 2018]. Fourteen farms in the world's biggest dairy exporter have tested positive for the disease since it was 1st detected in South Canterbury on the country's South Island in July [2017].

_Mycoplasma bovis_ is common in many countries and can lead to conditions such as udder infection, pneumonia and arthritis in affected cattle, but does not pose a food safety risk or any risk to humans.

The Ministry said in December [2017] that the disease had spread for the 1st time to a property on the North Island. Under the stepped-up program, which will start in February [2018], 3 separate milk samples will be tested from every dairy farm in the country, the Ministry said in a statement on its website. The initial outbreak led to concerns that the disease could affect market access for New Zealand's diary products, and caused a brief dip in the New Zealand dollar.

[A logical next step as it now affects dairy herds in both North and South New Zealand.
