Regarding your commentary in ProMED post "Ebola virus disease - West Africa (177): WHO, quarantine, vaccine, Liberia, survivors 20140926.2808526, item [4] Vaccine delivery dilemma," in which you write: "Furthermore, the vaccine is a live one, and reversion and breakthroughs have been known to happen with other live vaccines." To me, it is not clear whether you mean to suggest with this statement that the VSV-EBOV vaccine that is referred to in this post might revert to a wild-type VSV [vesicular stomatitis virus] genotype and/or cause breakthrough VSV infection, or whether you are suggesting that the vaccine might actually cause EVD itself.

It is important to note that the VSV-EBOV vaccine is NOT a live attenuated Ebola virus, in which case, reversion to a virulent phenotype or breakthrough Ebola virus infection would theoretically be possible. Rather, the vaccine consists of a live recombinant VSV, in which the VSV glycoprotein gene has been exchanged against the Ebola virus glycoprotein gene (GP). In other words, the vaccine contains less than 10 percent of the genetic information of Ebola virus. Therefore, there is absolutely no conceivable possibility that reversion of this vaccine to a virulent Ebola virus genotype or a breakthrough-infection causing EVD could occur. Furthermore, exchange of the VSV glycoprotein gene against the Ebola virus glycoprotein gene has led to an attenuation of the VSV vector itself (which, even in its non-attenuated form, does not cause significant human disease to start with http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/lab-bio/res/psds-ftss/stomatit-eng.php), and, consequently, this vaccine is safe not only in healthy non-human primates but even in severely immunocompromised non-human primates http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?orig_db=pubmed&term=19043556).

Given the high reputation and the reach of ProMED in the scientific and medical community, and potentially also among volunteers getting ready for work in West Africa, such an unclear statement has the potential to cause unsubstantiated concerns with serious consequences. Therefore, it might be a good decision to clarify the point that VSV-EBOV is not a live attenuated Ebola virus and that there is absolutely no risk (also not as a consequence of reversion or breakthrough-infection) of it causing EVD.

[My comment was seriously wrong. I thank Dr Hoenen for his clarification, which I hope will be widely disseminated to dispel any misunderstanding of Dr Taylor's reported statement, quoted by ProMED, that: "It is a live, attenuated virus, so that means it has to be kept at a certain temperature throughout, or it kills the virus and it's inactive." The live part is a low pathogenic (for humans) strain of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), from a disease of horses, mules, cattle and pigs.

Once again, it is NOT made from live or attenuated ebolavirus. I regret the error. - Mod.JW]
