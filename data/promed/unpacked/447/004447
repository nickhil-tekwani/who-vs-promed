[We had had a suggestion that the Louisiana cattlemen should have put
impregnated ear tags on their cattle to prevent this condition ...
[but the cattle already have impregnated eartags to control
fly bothering and the losses attendant on attempting to round up and insert
new eartags in the summer heat ... so I passed it to my friend Dayton
Steelman in Lafayette for comment. One of the references quoted was:
Focks D A. McLaughlin R E. Nasci R S.
"Effect of permethrin treatment of cattle on Psorophora columbiae
populations: preliminary field test of a host management concept." J Am Mosq
Control Assoc 7(1):1-6 1991
Attempt to control _P. columbiae populations_ by application of
permethrin to their preferred host cattle. Authors concluded that
host abundance was more important than mosquito abundance & that the
treatments by a course spray reduced mosquito abundance by some 83%.

In my opinion the best job against mosquitoes is by far "large area
treatment" of ULV insecticides --I really mean Ultra Low Volume. Like around
1-2 fl.oz. per acre applied by an airplane or by ground equipment with the
proper equipment to break the chemicals up into around 10 micron size
droplets for the ground equipment and 50-100 microns for the airplane.
Putting the chemicals out and letting the prevailing wind drift the
insecticide across the cattle does an excellent job and can be repeated day
and night if necessary. It kills the adults on the animals, resting in
various vegetation and while flying.
The very best example of this was the VEE control program by the USDA in the
early 70s. After two applications of airplane application of malathion and
dibrom there were no measurable numbers of mosquitoes left around the cattle
or human areas. Groud application equipment can be mounted on a small
trailer or pick/up and driven on the upwind side of the animals at about 15
miles per hour even in pastures --can be placed in a boat and driven along
canals etc.
I think eartags would kill lots of mosquitoes --but they have to land on the
animal and attempt to or actually feed before the insecticide knocks them
down or kills them --some chemicals take about 6-8 hours or longer to kill
treated mosquitoes...

Been there and seen that! I got to LS and U in the summer of 1965 and heard
all about the earlier "monster" hoards of mosquitoes -- and yes they were
_Ae. sollicitans_ -- that and the next 2-3 years caused the pressure to be
placed to hire someone to conduct research to help solve this kind of
problem. Lucky for me I got the job. In 1971 at just about exactly the same
time that VEE moved from Mexico into Texas, we were in the middle of quite
similar "monster hoards" of _Ae. sollicitans_ attack. On several occasions I
went with local veterinarians to watch them post dead cattle -- and what you
describe was the same things we saw.
However, in some cases we found upon
observing the respiration system beginning in the nostrils that they were
completely blocked by adult female mosquitoes and -- we thought that as
you stated the animals were in a super-stressed or shock condition and could
not muster the strength to "snort" out the mosquitoes they were breathing
into the respiration system!
The bottom line was the VEE spray progam provided by USDA to protect horses
for the 14 days necessary for the VEE vaccine to take effect actually
convinced the human population in the state that something could be done to
protect humans and animals from mosquito attack --- due to that I helped
start Mosquito Abatement Districts in the Parishes of Calcasieu, Cameron,
Jeff Davis,within the next 2-3 years and later, East Baton Rouge, St.
Tammany, St. Charles, Iberia, Caddo, and at Monroe.
Why have the Mosquito Abatement Districts in the area not been actively
fighting the problem?

[In internal discussions on this posting, Charlie Calisher said that he had
seen the same as Dayton but in Florida. "In 1967, on a trip to Everglades
National Park with Dan Sudia, we came across an exsanguinated cow in a cane
field. The owner told us the cow had appeared in good health the previous
day but that that evening he had seen "more mosquitoes than I have ever
seen" come up out of a pond and attack the poor creature. Bled it out. No
matter how much blood a cow can have, a zillion mosquitoes can take damn
near all of it. I asked Carl Mitchell how much blood does a mosquito take in
a blood meal. He said 5-6 ul. Thus, 5 ul x 1000 mosq = 1 ml and
1,000,000 mosquitoes would take a L. Doesn't sound as though exsanguination
is the answer, although it might be. More likely, Carl says and which you
had suggested, suffocation is the answer." Or exhaustion and shock. For us
it was interesting that they demonstrated a terminal bacillary bacteraemia.
These were never _B. anthracis_. We did check one isolate out completely and
it was _B. megaterium_. Mod MHJ
[Other estimates are that a mosquito blood meal is only 2.5 ul,
requiring 2 million feeds to drain 1 liter of blood. Since Martin
calculates that a Louisiana bull has some 45 l. of blood in it, to
knock its hematocrit down fatally by 70% would require 60 million
mosquitoes to feed on it in a couple of days. Perhaps the bites
promote internal hemorrhage, although this was not mentioned in the
autopsy reports - Mod.JW
