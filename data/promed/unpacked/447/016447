The Ministry of Health has notified WHO of a total of 21 suspected
cases and 14 deaths in the Kayes region, primarily affecting
Bafoulabe district, between 7 and 27 Oct 2005 (see previous report).
After initial tests at the national reference laboratory in Mali, 14
blood specimens taken from suspected cases were sent to the WHO
Collaborating Centre for Yellow Fever, the Pasteur Institute, Dakar,
Senegal. 4 samples were positive for yellow fever.
A team from the Ministry of Health, Medecins sans Frontieres, and WHO
is currently carrying out an epidemiological assessment in the
affected area. The Ministry of Health is requesting an additional 4
million doses of yellow fever vaccine to increase vaccination
coverage in the surrounding districts.

Increased virus circulation among insufficiently immunized
populations in combination with the region's rampant urbanization set
the scene for an explosion of urban epidemics. This situation is
aggravated by spontaneous or forced migrations of unprotected people
to areas at risk.
In Africa, since 2000, 18 countries have reported yellow fever. West
Africa is the most affected region, with 13 (72 percent) countries
burdened.
In West Africa, since 2000, 13 of the 14 (93 percent) countries with
at least one case of yellow fever notified since 1950 have regularly
reported cases and faced outbreaks. The 14 countries at risk of
yellow fever transmission in West Africa are: Benin, Burkina Faso,
Cote d'Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali,
Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo.
The resurgence of the disease in West Africa mainly affects countries
whose populations have gradually lost the protection provided by the
mass preventive immunization campaigns carried out between 1933 and
1961, such as Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Senegal and
Togo.
Although the number of cases is low, this situation is of great
concern given that the number of reported cases underestimates the
real magnitude of the problem.
The reported cases are only the severe cases who seek cure in
medium-sized public health care facilities (maximum 1-2 percent of
the infected people in a non-epidemic period). Therefore the
underestimation of the number of cases depends on many factors such
as access to the health care system, sensitivity of the surveillance
system, laboratory capacity to confirm cases and the willingness of
the country to report a disease with potential negative impact on
travel and tourism.
Moreover, 4 of the West African countries at risk of yellow fever are
currently considered to be in a complex emergency situation (Cote
d'Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone). This has a 2-sided impact
on the epidemiology of yellow fever: 1st the humanitarian crisis
prevents routine immunization programmes from being carried out, and
2nd the conflict is responsible for forced migrations of thousands of
people, amplifying the potential virus circulation. In these
circumstances, the response to an epidemic calls for greater
coordination between the national health authorities and partners
(NGOs and international organizations).
Multiple outbreaks may occur at the same time in many different
places, stressing the response capacity of the country and
overwhelming the support capacity of the international community.
