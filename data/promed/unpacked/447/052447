First BSE Case Detected in Slovenia
-----------------------------------
BELGRADE: The first case of BSE disease was detected in Slovenia, the
Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported Monday. Slovenian Agricultural
Minister Franci said the Ljubljana National Veterinary Institute confirmed
the first case of the disease after conducting 3 tests on a cow from a farm
run by a company in Gornja Savinjaka valley areas, Tanjug said.
The news added much to the concerns of local farmers and beef exporters,
who worry that prices of Slovenia's beef would fall drastically on
international and domestic markets, putting more strain on the country's
gloomy agricultural forecast.

[One may wonder at how much BSE may be in Slovenia. The past troubles in
Yugoslavia will have inhibited normal surveillance for such diseases in
previous years. Speculatively it will have reached Slovenia through
imported cattle feed stuffs. If this regional pattern continues we will see
more cases throughout this corner of Europe. - Mod.MHJ
