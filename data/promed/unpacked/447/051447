Chinese medical scientists have confirmed the first case of TTV, a virus
which can cause hepatitis, in northeast China.
Japan first discovered the virus in December 1997 and named it TTV. The
virus can be spread through blood transfusions, and TTV carriers were
reportedly later found in some areas of south China.
Researchers at the infectious disease department of the No. 2 Medical
Hospital attached to Shenyang's China Medical Sciences University began
collecting serum from hepatitis patients last year and screened the serum
using gene amplification technology.
Through their research, they found cases of TTV infection in Liaoning, and
also discovered incidences of TTV infection among hepatitis patients who
did not have blood transfusions.
Experts concluded that TTV infection is closely related to blood
transfusions, and people suffering from TTV infection and hepatitis B are
likely to develop more serious or chronic hepatitis.
China has a high incidence of hepatitis, and scientists believe this
discovery will play an important role in future hepatitis research.
