Sickness linked to tsunami
--------------------------
An outbreak of disease along the Somali coastline is feared to have
been caused by illegally dumped toxic waste containers that were
broken up by the Asian tsunami.
The United Nations said yesterday that it would send inspectors to
assess the pollution, which follows the deaths of about 300 Somalians
from the initial impact of the waves.
Nick Nuttall, a UN spokesman, said: "We have reports of hazardous
waste -- including radioactive materials -- being broken up by the
tsunami. We also have reports from people in fishing villages suffering a
variety of ailments, from mouth bleeds, nasty respiratory diseases
and skin disorders to abdominal haemorrhages."
