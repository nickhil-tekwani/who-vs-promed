[Varroosis is a worldwide distributed bee disease, caused by the mite _Varroa destructor_ (formerly _Varroa jacobsoni_), a parasite of adult bees and their brood. It penetrates the intersegmental skin between the abdominal sclera of adult bees to ingest haemolymph. It can sometimes be found between the head and thorax. The number of parasites steadily increases with increasing brood activity and the growth of the bee population, especially late in the season when clinical signs of infestation can 1st be recognized. The life span of the mite depends on temperature and humidity, but, in practice, it can be said to last from some days to a few months.

Varroosis is reportable to the OIE; for its global distribution (2004), see http://www.oie.int/hs2/sit_mald_cont.asp?c_mald=134&c_cont=6.

[In the ProMED archives, this is referenced as foulbrood but more often as foul brood. As a veterinarian, it is not for me to judge the correctness or absence thereof in either term.

The causal organism of European foulbrood of honey bees (EFB) is the bacterium _Melissococcus plutonius_.

The identification of its presence by the observation of signs of disease in the field is unreliable. The most usual and obvious sign is the death of larvae shortly before they are due to be sealed in their cells, but this may be for reasons other than European foulbrood. Most infected colonies display few visible signs, which themselves often quickly abate spontaneously before the end of each active season. Infection remains enzootic within individual colonies because of mechanical contamination of the honeycombs by the durable organism. Recurrences of disease can, therefore, be expected in subsequent years.

Identification of the agent: Examination, by high-power microscopy, of suitable preparations of larval remains for the presence of numerous lanceolate cocci is adequate for most practical purposes, especially when it is done by experienced individuals.

Traditionally, the diagnosis of EFB is done by isolating and identifying the causative organism. This can be differentiated quite readily from all other bacteria associated with bees by its fastidious cultural requirements.

Additional data on EFB diagnosis are available at http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/2008/pdf/2.02.03_EUROPEAN_FOULB.pdf.

[These reports say the 2 problems, presumably in the same 10 hives, have been resolved, but the Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals removed from the susceptible population through death or destruction were not calculated because of missing information. One hopes that the bees were destroyed and the hives disinfected.

Foulbrood spores are extremely resistant to desiccation and can remain viable for more than 40 years in honey and beekeeping equipment. The microscopic identification of these 2 outbreaks was not a simple matter, but a PCR test is available, and it is hoped that future importations of bees will be similarly expertly screened.
