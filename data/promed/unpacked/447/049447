WHO concern at increased cases of dengue fever in the region
------------------------------------------------------------
MANILA: More than 46 400 dengue fever cases with nearly 190 deaths had been
reported in the Asia Pacific region [this year as of July 2001, showing a
rising trend in the region, said the Western Pacific Region Office of the
World Health Organization (WHO) in a report issued on Tue 28 Aug 2001. The
hardest-hit countries so far are Cambodia, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia,
the Philippines, and French Polynesia and Samoa in the Pacific. The
Philippines reported 7697 cases including 67 deaths.
A dengue pandemic swept through the Western Pacific region and other parts
of the world in 1998, with a total of 356 554 reported cases. An overall
decline in the annual number of cases and deaths were observed in the
following 2 years, with 64 066 cases in 1999 and 45 603 cases in 2000.
Levels seen so far in 2001 have been below those seen in 1998 but are
higher than in 1999 and 2000, which gives rise for concern.
WHO is urging all tropical countries in the region to intensify their
surveillance, including laboratory confirmation, in order to detect
potential outbreak areas quickly and to implement epidemic control measures.

the serotypes of dengue virus circulating in the region. Without such

disease outbreaks. - Mod.CP
