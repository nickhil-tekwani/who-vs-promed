Iraq: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 2
----------------------------------------------
A WHO-led team of international experts, including veterinary
expertise from FAO, is now in the Erbil and Sulaimaniyah area of
northern Iraq, where a fatal human case of H5N1 infection was
confirmed on 30 Jan 2006. Confirmed outbreaks of highly pathogenic
H5N1 in poultry were reported in the area on 2 Feb 2006. The team has
met with officials in the country's Ministries of Health and
Agriculture and is now assessing the situation in hospitals,
laboratories, and animals. A list of immediate needs for support has
been established. Government officials have expressed a need for
emergency supplies and equipment, including antiviral drugs, and
these have already begun to arrive in the country. A 24-hour
emergency operations centre has been set up in the WHO regional
office in Cairo to facilitate coordination and provide back-up
support.
The transportation of patient samples for diagnostic confirmation has
encountered difficulties. Ways to strengthen local testing capacity
are being explored together with ways to expedite the shipment of
samples to WHO reference laboratories. The team has noted a need to
upgrade biosafety standards in local and national laboratories.
Intensive culling of poultry is under way in the area; improved
diagnostic capacity for poultry is needed to focus these efforts
better. Training to enhance the diagnostic capacity of veterinary
laboratories and improve surveillance has already begun. Requests for
essential supplies, including diagnostic reagents, are being met.
The area has around 1.3 million poultry mainly raised by individual
households, who depend on these animals for income and food.
Discussions are under way to develop a compensation scheme that could
lessen the hardship on these families.
The team found a good system in place for detecting and managing
possible human cases, collecting specimens, and tracing and
monitoring contacts. Some improvements in isolation wards are
planned. Intensive training courses are being organized for hospital
staff to ensure that proper measures for personal protection and
infection control are in place.
Two patients hospitalized for observation have been discharged,
though their condition continues to be monitored by local health
teams. At present, 7 patients are being treated, in isolation, at
hospitals in the area. Most of these patients have reported a history
of direct contact with diseased poultry.
In addition to the confirmed fatal case, two patients under
investigation for possible H5N1 infection have died. Specimens from
one of these, the 39-year-old uncle of the confirmed case, have
tested positive for H5N1 infection in a local laboratory; his
infection has not yet been confirmed by a WHO reference laboratory.
A possible H5N1 case in the southern part of the country has been
officially reported to WHO by the Ministry of Health. The case, a
13-year-old boy from the Omara area, developed symptoms on 1 Feb, was
hospitalized with severe pneumonia on 5 Feb, and died the same day.
Although no poultry deaths have been reported in the area, pet birds
kept by the family are said to have died near the time of symptom
onset. Samples from the boy have been taken. The Minister of Health
and a team from the country's Centre for Disease Control will visit
the Omara area tomorrow to investigate.

[There are some minor discrepancies between this official WHO account
of the current situation in Iraq and the newswire account posted
yesterday. In particular, in the WHO update, the suspected case of
H5N1 avian influenza in southeastern Iraq is described as a
13-year-old boy from the Osmara area, whereas the Agence France
Presse report identified the suspected case as a man living in the
city of Amara [Al Amara]. In both accounts the patient had died and
the diagnosis of H5N1 virus infection was based on possession of H5N1
virus-infected pet birds or pigeons. (See
