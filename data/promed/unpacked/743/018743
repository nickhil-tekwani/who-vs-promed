2001/091 Details on the situation of _Xanthomonas arboricola_ pv. _pruni_
and _Xanthomonas vesicatoria_ in Slovenia
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The NPPO of Slovenia recently informed the EPPO Secretariat of the present
situation of _Xanthomonas arboricola_ pv. _pruni_ and _Xanthomonas
vesicatoria_ (both EPPO A2 quarantine pests) in Slovenia.
_Xanthomonas arboricola_ pv. _pruni_ (Xap)
An outbreak of Xap on plum ... [occurred on plums in the coastal
Mediterranean region of Slovenia [in 1996. Recently, a new outbreak was
[noted in peach orchards in the same region. Xap was identified by
laboratory methods (isolation on growing medium, immunofluorescence, fatty
acid profiles). Phytosanitary measures ... [were taken to eradicate the
disease and prevent any further spread. Treatments with copper fungicides
in autumn, early spring, and later during the growing season were ordered
in all infected orchards. Growers were also recommended to use certified
planting material and to plant tolerant or less susceptible cultivars. The
situation of Xav... in Slovenia can be described as follows: Present: found
only in the coastal Mediterranean region.
_Xanthomonas vesicatoria_ (Xv)
Bacterial spot of tomato and pepper occurs from time to time in Slovenia in
warmer and more humid regions. During [2000 ... samples were collected
from capsicum plants showing symptoms at 3 production sites, in different
regions. Xv was isolated from samples from 2 production sites: one near
Nova Gorica (west coastal region) and the other from Kostanjevica (southern
region). The presence of [Xv ... was confirmed by immunofluorescence and
comparison of fatty acid profiles. Phytosanitary measures were taken to
prevent any further spread. Tomato and pepper cultivation was prohibited
for the next 3 years on plots where positive samples had been taken. It was
also recommended [that ... tomato and pepper growers of the 2 regions ...
use sterilized or heat-treated seeds and resistant cultivars. The situation
of Xv in Slovenia can be described as follows: Present: sporadic (in 2000,
near Nova Gorica and Kostanjevica).

[The bacterial spot pathogen can cause serious diseases in a number of
stone fruits (almond, apricot, nectarine, peach, and plum). Infected trees
are often severely defoliated with consequent reduction in quantity and
quality. Disease management options include avoiding use of highly
susceptible cultivars, timely application of copper sprays, and use of
resistant cultivars.
A useful reference is the following:
<http://www.caf.wvu.edu/kearneysville/disease_descriptions/ombactsp.html>
Bacterial spot is a serious disease of tomato and pepper. The pathogen is
seed-borne and overwinters on decaying plant debris in soil. Contaminated
seed is a primary source of inoculum. Use of disease-free seed,
applications of copper and maneb sprays will reduce infection in the current
crop. Use of resistant cultivars is recommended. - Mod.DH
