As if the COVID-19 pandemic is not bad enough, some districts of Assam are now in the grip of Japanese encephalitis (JE) and floods.

Official sources said 82 cases of JE and acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) were reported from districts such as Cachar, Dibrugarh, Sonitpur, Kamrup, and Morigaon. So far, there have been no deaths.

"We have recorded 79 cases of AES and 3 cases of JE. Of these, 2 JE patients have been discharged from hospitals. The remaining others are under treatment and stable," Dr Lakshmanan S, who is the Mission Director of National Health Mission in Assam, told this newspaper.

He said the 3rd JE patient was "stable" but she had multiple infections.

"The challenges are innumerable but we are working hard. The reality is there will be people whom we will not be able to save because of the natural course of the disease," Lakshmanan added.

Assam has been vulnerable to JE all along. The combined number of deaths due to JE and AES last year [2019] was 600 -- 154 of them in JE. JE alone accounted for 94 deaths in 2018, 87 in 2017, 92 in 2016, 135 in 2015, and 165 in 2014.

Meanwhile, the 1st flood of the year [2020], triggered by incessant rains and the release of water from a dam, affected 2980 people in 3 villages of 2 districts such as Barpeta and Lakhimpur.

[Japanese encephalitis and acute encephalitis syndrome are again appearing this year (2020) in Assam state. The majority of the cases mentioned above are classified as AES. As mentioned in previous ProMED-mail posts, the issue of the etiology of AES has been under discussion for a long time. AES has continued to be attributed to various etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible Japanese encephalitis, enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, intoxication from lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 commonest agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue.

The report above does not indicate whether any of the AES etiologies above have been ruled out or confirmed. Until the etiology (or etiologies) of these AES cases is determined, effective and efficient prevention of these cases will not be possible. The season in which AES cases occur is just beginning, and additional cases can be expected over the coming 6-7 months.

It is difficult to know what effect the reported flooding may have on the breeding sites of JE virus vectors. Larvae and pupae may be washed away and new breeding sites created. Although mosquito control is not mentioned in the report above as a JE preventive measure, it is difficult to effectively accomplish in localities where the JE virus vectors, _Culex_ spp., are abundant and widespread. Because the _Culex_ vector mosquitoes also breed in rice paddies, which may be extensive, vector control over large areas is difficult. It is curious that no mention is made of vaccination campaigns in the affected areas. Vaccination is the most effective measure to prevent JE virus infection. - Mod.TY
