BSE COLLINGE'S TRANSGENIC MICE

[- In response to yet another question Ralph Blanchfield answered
interestingly, as ever, though not quite as I had expected and at
somewhat of a tangent. However, it is well worth sharing. My
original question is irrelevent. MHJ]

Here we go again. I think you are probably referring to what I call
"Collinge's transgenic mice" -- it sounds like the name of a music
hall act but is an extremely important piece of research.
The paper was published in Nature (Collinge et al, "Unaltered
susceptibility to BSE in transgenic mice expressing human prion
protein", Nature (1995), 378, 21/28 December) Up to the present, the
indication is that bovine distorted PrP has failed to affect normal
human PrP. John Collinge and his colleagues studied mice
genetically-engineered so that they expressed human prion protein as
well as normal mouse prion protein in their brains. They injected the
mice intracerebrally with CJD, and the mice fell victim to the
disease, demonstrating that with human protein, the human disease CJD
was transmitted. When they exposed similar mice to BSE. The mouse
prion protein succumbed to BSE but the human prion protein did not..
An encouraging first stage, but they have also carried out the
experiments with genetically-modified mice that express only human
protein and no mouse protein. The group treated with CJD succumbed to
CJD at 200 days. So far the group challenged with BSE infectivity are
still fit and well after passing the 400 days milestone. This study
may need to go on for 600 -700 days if these mice die of old age
rather than succumbing to BSE. If successful, there is a need to
repeat the studies with mice expressing human protein of genotypes
other than the one originally chosen (which was the one considered to
be most susceptible to human prion diseases).

It is a vital piece of research, and I'm metaphorically watching those
mice with bated breath. It all looks very encouraging at present, and
increasingly so if they eventually die of old age or some other cause.
Conversely, if they succumb to BSE, albeit after a much longer
incubation period, it would have to be regarded as the first bit of
scientific evidence pointing towards the possibility of transmissibility
to humans. This would spawn a host of further questions (Extrapolation
from intracerebral to oral? All humans? Some humans, and if so, which?
etc etc)
Even if the BSE-challenged mice survive, as Prof Collinge has pointed
out, safety can never be proved with certainty. But then that is true
of safety in any aspect of life.
You might also like to refer to a contribution by Collinge in
"Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in a young woman: Report of a Meeting of
Physicians and Scientists, St Thomas' Hospital, London", The Lancet,
(1996) 347, 945-948, in which he enlarges on the background of CJD and
on the possibility of establishing whether an individual case of CJD
was caused by BSE, by strain-typing.
There are of course others experimenting with transgenic mice, notably
Stanley Prusiner in California (e.g. Telling G C et al "Prion propagation
in mice expressing human and chimeric PrP transgenes implicates the
interaction of cellular PrP with another protein", Cell (1995), Vol 83,
6 October, 79-90) and Adriano Aguzzi in Zurich (e.g. Brandner et al,
Nature, Vol 379, 25 January, 339-342), but I think Collinge et al is the
relevant one for your question, Interestingly Adriano Aguzzi and his team
have been doing the histopathology on the French V-CJD victim's brain.
