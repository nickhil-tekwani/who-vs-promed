Diphtheria is caused by a bacterium which includes several species (_Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _C. ulcerans_, _C. pseudotuberculosis_), sometimes carrying a gene at the origin of the severity of the disease.

Since the beginning of 2022, several cases of diphtheria have been reported in 9 regions of metropolitan France, as well as in Mayotte and Réunion. Compared with other years, the number of cases of _C. diphtheriae_ is significantly higher than average. In metropolitan France, the majority of cases were reported in migrants and travelers. Thanks to the very high vaccination coverage for many years, the occurrence of serious cases or clustered cases within the general population appears extremely low in metropolitan France and Reunion. In Mayotte, where vaccination coverage is insufficient, the bacterium has been circulating for several years.

Public Health France is monitoring the evolution of the situation and the increase in cases of diphtheria among migrants, the vast majority of whom are not up to date with their vaccinations. A reminder of vaccination and management recommendations has been sent to associations and healthcare professionals.

As of 30 Nov 2022, 55 cases of diphtheria have been reported in France since the start of the year [2022] (figure 1 - see source URL):
- 8 cases of diphtheria due to _Corynebacterium ulcerans_ (_C. ulcerans_) in metropolitan France;
- 30 cases of diphtheria due to _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_ (_C. diphtheriae_) in metropolitan France;
- 13 cases of diphtheria caused by _C. diphtheriae_ in Mayotte and 4 cases in Reunion.

In 2022, compared with the last 5 years, the number of diphtheria cases due to _C. ulcerans_ was similar (on average 7.2 cases per year), but the number of cases of diphtheria due to _C. diphtheriae_ [in 2022] was significantly higher than the average per year then observed (metropolitan France: 3.4 cases per year over the last 5 years; Mayotte: 2.6 cases per year over the last 5 years; Reunion: 0.6 cases per year over the last 5 years).

In France, the majority of cases (24) were reported in migrants, but also in travelers (5) (Figure 2 [available at the source URL]). For these 29 cases, a link was found with one or more of the following countries: Afghanistan (21), Turkey (6), Italy (5), Serbia (5), Austria (4), Tunisia (3), Bulgaria (2), Iran (2), Hungary (2), Mali (2), Switzerland (2), Slovenia (1), Syria (1), Senegal (1), Thailand (1). When the date of their arrival in France was known (9), it was fewer than 15 days before the date of notification of the disease.

In addition, a case was probably infected on French territory during contact with a person returning from a trip to Togo.

Cases of diphtheria due to _C. diphtheriae_ were mainly men (28), aged 11 to 47 years (mean 21 year). Only 2 of them were up to date with their diphtheria vaccination. For 24 of them, the vaccination status was unknown. Among the cases that occurred among migrants, 6 lived in a shelter.

Cases have been diagnosed in 9 regions. The Normandy region was the most affected with 7 cases reported (figure 3 [available at the source URL]). A total of 25 cases were cutaneous forms, 3 were asymptomatic carriers (oropharyngeal), 1 was a slightly symptomatic respiratory form (autochthonous case) and another presented the symptoms of classic respiratory diphtheria (migrant person).

Two grouped cases were reported: one concerned 4 cases who had traveled together on a bus and the other 2 cases who had traveled together.

Genotyping of 19 isolates by the National Reference Center (CNR) for _Corynebacteria_ of the diphtheriae complex by genomic sequencing showed 5 different genetic groups: ST377a (2 cases), ST377b (1 case), ST384 (2 cases), ST574 (3 cases), ST698 (2 cases). These groups have also been identified in other European countries. The other isolates are being sequenced.

This increase in the number of cases among migrants is also observed in other European countries. As of 26 Sep 2022, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reported 92 cases of _C. diphtheriae_ diphtheria in 2022 in 7 European countries (Germany, Austria, Belgium, France, Great Britain, Norway, Switzerland).

In Mayotte, the autochthonous circulation of the bacterium has been known for several years. In 2022, of the 13 cases reported, 7 were cutaneous forms, 1 ENT form and 5 were asymptomatic (ENT) carriers of the bacterium. These last 5 infections were discovered among close contacts of 2 symptomatic cases. One death occurred in an unvaccinated 7 month old baby.

In Reunion, over the period 2021-2022, all the cases reported were imported cases. In 2022, 4 cases were declared and no notion of travel was found. These 4 cases were apparently unrelated and were cutaneous forms.

The analysis of the genomic groupings, by the CNR, showed that 12 strains (8 in Mayotte and 4 in Reunion) had the same characteristics, which strongly suggests that these cases are linked. We have no hypothesis at this stage on the nature of this link.

In mainland France and Réunion, France has a very high vaccination coverage (VC) against diphtheria: 99% for the primary vaccination and 96% for the booster at 11 months in infants in 2019. These vaccination coverages have been very high for many years, the vaccine having been made compulsory up to the age of 13 until 2018. In addition, vaccination is compulsory for infants born from 2018. The risk of occurrence of cases, in particular serious and/or cases grouped within the general French population, remains extremely low.

In Réunion, the VC is also high (97.4% for the 11-month recall in 2018). On the other hand, the increase in cases of diphtheria among migrants, the vast majority of whom are not up to date with their vaccinations, raises fears of the appearance of grouped cases of infection with _C. diphtheriae_ in places of accommodation for migrants, refugees or asylum seekers (this scenario has been described in Switzerland, Kofler et al., Eurosurveillance 2022). In order to prevent this risk, a message(1) informing of this increase in cases among migrants and recalling the recommendations for vaccination and care(2) has been sent to associations caring for migrant populations and to health professionals.

Investigations and discussions on cases occurring among migrants are carried out at European level (ECDC and WHO) in particular to identify a possible place of contamination (countries crossed on the migratory route or country of origin such as Afghanistan).

In Mayotte, studies carried out over the past few years show an insufficient VC to ensure collective immunity. In 2019, 93.2% of children aged 24 to 59 months, 45.3% of 7-11 year olds, and 27.1% of 14-16 year olds were up to date with their diphtheria vaccination. Interventions aimed at increasing vaccination coverage in these populations must be reinforced in this territory.

Humans are the only reservoir of _ Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, the cause of diphtheria. Transmission of _C. diphtheriae_ can occur through respiratory droplets, direct contact with cutaneous infections, and articles soiled with discharges from the respiratory tract or skin lesions. Travel to an endemic area is a risk factor for the acquisition of _C. diphtheriae_. _Corynebacterium ulcerans_ and _Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis_ cause zoonotic infection in humans (http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/prevguid/m0051752/m0051752.asp) and contact with a companion animal is also a risk factor for acquisition of _C. ulcerans_. All 8 _C. ulcerans_ cases in metropolitan France were acquired locally in France, probably related to zoonotic transmission from farm animals or following consumption of unpasteurized dairy products.

ProMED has recently posted several reports on diphtheria at facilities in Europe used to house recent refugees, asylum seekers, and migrants (see ProMED posts Diphtheria - Germany: toxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae, cutaneous, migrants 20221119.8706803; Diphtheria - UK (02): (England) asylum seekers 20221127.8706944; Diphtheria - UK: (England) asylum seekers 20221021.8706299; and Diphtheria - Switzerland: (Bern) asylum seekers 20220804.8704867). The above report concerns an increase in the number of cases of diphtheria in France in 2022; the majority of cases were reported in "migrants and travelers".

"Traveler" in this regard usually refers to someone who has traveled from their place of origin to an endemic region where they acquired a disease and then returned to their place of origin. However, the terms "refugee", "asylum seeker" and "migrant" are often used interchangeably, but it is important to distinguish between them as there are legal differences.

According to Amnesty International (https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/refugees-asylum-seekers-and-migrants/): "A 'refugee' is a person who has fled their own country because they are at risk of serious human rights violations and persecution there. The risks to their safety and life were so great that they felt they had no choice but to leave and seek safety outside their country because their own government cannot or will not protect them from those dangers. Refugees have a right to international protection."

"An 'asylum seeker' is a person who has left their country and is seeking protection from persecution and serious human rights violations in another country, but who hasn't yet been legally recognized as a refugee and is waiting to receive a decision on their asylum claim. Seeking asylum is a human right. This means everyone should be allowed to enter another country to seek asylum."

"There is no internationally accepted legal definition of a 'migrant'. Like most agencies and organizations, we at Amnesty International understand migrants to be people staying outside their country of origin, who are not asylum seekers or refugees. Some migrants leave their country because they want to work, study or join family, for example. Others feel they must leave because of poverty, political unrest, gang violence, natural disasters or other serious circumstances that exist there."

In Germany, there have been 42 cases of diphtheria caused by toxigenic _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_ in migrants who have arrived in Germany since May 2022. There were no cases in migrants in 2019, 7 in 2020, and 7 in 2021. Most cases in migrants were detected by medical examinations at reception centers. Countries of origin, when known, were mostly Syria (21) and Afghanistan (17), with one each from Tunisia and Yemen. Migrants were en route often for months, living under very poor hygienic condition, usually without access to healthcare services. For 23 of the 42 cases with information on transit routes to Germany, most traveled along a Balkan route -- that is, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, and Slovenia -- where they were said to have likely acquired diphtheria, based in part on genetic analysis of isolates.

Genotyping of isolates in the outbreak in migrants in Germany showed 4 types: ST-377, ST-384, ST-574, and ST-377 resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin; ST-377, ST-384, ST-574 were also seen in outbreaks in Austria and Norway; ST-377 resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin were isolated from migrants in Switzerland (https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2022.27.46.2200849). The above report says that ST groups in France are similar to ST groups identified in other European countries. - Mod.ML
