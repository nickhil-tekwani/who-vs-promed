I am a little surprised by your moderator's comments to the second posting.
The moderators comments could be construed that in his/her opinion
childhood vaccinations are a possible cause of CJD in these case. I hope
that the moderator meant that these cases may have other commonalties such
as vaccinations. There is a large and growing anti-vaccination movement in
the United States which is unfortunate because vaccinations were the #1
greatest health achievement in the 1900's (according to the CDC) and we as
health care and public health officials need to be wary unnecessarily
fanning the flames of this movement.

[Stephen and others have written regarding my comment about vaccines. I do
not mean to imply vaccines are related to the cluster of nvCJD in the UK. I
would not care to diminish the excellent vaccines now available for a
number of different disease conditions. However, there seems to be a very
narrow focus on processed meat food, such as school lunches and baby food.
My point in mentioning vaccines is there may be more commonality with these
victims than food, such as childhood vaccines. But let me hasten to add, I
am not implicating, suggesting or implying vaccines. I am only suggesting
that tunnel vision in an investigation is not appropriate either. - Mod.TG
