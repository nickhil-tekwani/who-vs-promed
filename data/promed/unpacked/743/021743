A dog entered Argentina from Bolivia last July [2008] through Jujuy,
where a human rabies case transmitted by a dog occurred also last
July (the 1st for the country in more than 20 years), developed
neurological symptoms on 10 Nov 2008, and died yesterday [16 Nov 2008].

The isolated rabies virus was identified as variant 1 and corresponds
to the 1st case in dogs in Buenos Aires since 1981.

The Institute has taken sanitary and surveillance actions and ring
immunization of dogs and cats in the area where the case occurred.

[It is sad, but not unexpected, to learn of the boy's death. Rabies
is generally fatal, with rare exceptions.

It is good to know that the institute has taken measures for
immunization of companion animals. - Mod.TG]

[Jujuy has had dog rabies cases over the past 2 years, despite an
intensive vaccination program (see ProMED archive no. 20080724.2256)
but in this instance, rabies virus was introduced into Jujuy via a
dog imported from Bolivia. Although Argentina has had cases of
rabies transmitted by vampire bats (_Demodus rotundus_) in the recent
past, the current case is a case of classical street rabies of dog
origin. Although one hopes that the intensive rabies vaccination
program carried out in July 2008 has provided complete immunization
of the dogs and cats in Jujuy, the proposed continuation of the
program in this area is prudent. - Mod.TY]
