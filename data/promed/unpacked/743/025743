The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that as of Thursday [1 Aug 2013], they have been notified of 400 cases of the parasitic infection cyclosporiasis from 17 health departments from across the country.

The newest state to report cases is Louisiana, which reported 2 cases yesterday [2 Aug 2013] in a news release. Louisiana joins Iowa, Texas, Nebraska, Florida, Wisconsin, New York City, Georgia, Illinois, Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Connecticut, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, and Ohio. The federal health agency says at least 22 people required hospitalization for their illnesses.

The Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals (DHH) reported the 2 cases, one in Bienville Parish and one in Terrebonne Parish. Louisiana health officials say one of the persons who became ill had eaten lettuce while in Texas. The other person did not report eating lettuce or salad.

The onset of symptoms in the 2 cases was in early July [2013], about the time of the peak of the national outbreak. Both cases were mild and did not require hospitalization.

"The best prevention is always to handle and prepare food in a manner that minimizes the presence of harmful germs," said Dr. Raoult Ratard, State Epidemiologist for DHH. "This includes washing fruits and vegetables before eating them. We also encourage people to wash their hands frequently throughout the day."

[The distribution of cases reflects the distribution of the products from 2 farms in Mexico, identified by the FDA as the source of infection. As the products are withdrawn, the outbreak will fade. Intestinal symptoms without any obvious cause, even in states which so far have not reported cases, should be investigated for Cyclospora. - Mod.EP
