At least 120 people in Iran have caught the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) since [21 Mar 2017], Karim Amiri, an official with the Islamic Republic's veterinary organization, said. The fever has caused the death of 8 people in Iran since the beginning of the current Iranian fiscal year[21 Mar 2017], Amiri said, Mehr news agency reported 24 Sep 2017.

No Crimean-Congo fever case has so far been reported in the capital city of Tehran, he added. The cases have been reported in 13 Iranian provinces including Sistan and Baluchestan, Fars, Kermanshah, Mazandaran, Esfaha, Hormozgan, Khorasan Razavi, Yazd, Gilan, Lorestan, Ardabil and Kerman, he said, adding that no death case is registered in Yazd, Gilan, Lorestan, Ardabil and Kerman so far. The official further advised Iranians to purchase the products from licensed centers.

Earlier the fever was reported mainly in eastern border provinces, where is livestock illegally smuggled into the country. Since 2000, about 1000 cases of Crimean-Congo fever have been reported in Iran, according to the Iranian officials.

CCHF is a widespread tick-borne viral disease that is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and Asia. The virus is a member of the _Bunyaviridae_ family of RNA viruses. It is a disease carried by several domestic and wild animals. While clinical disease is rare in infected animals, it is severe in infected humans, with a mortality rate of 10-40 percent.

[CCHF has been reported in 26 of the 31 provinces of Iran since 1999, with the greatest numbers of cases in Sistan and Baluchestan, Isfahan, Fars, Tehran, Khorasan, and Khuzestan regions [Mostafavi E, Haghdoost A, Khakifirouz S and Chinikar S. Spatial analysis of Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever in Iran. Am J Trop Med Hyg 2013; 89(6): 1135-41. doi: 10.4269/ajtmh.12-0509; available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3854891/]. Previously published data from Iran CCHF virus has been demonstrated in ticks in Iran as early as 1978, when the CCHFV was isolated for the 1st time from the _Ornithodoros_ tick _Alveonasus lahorensis_ in the north eastern region of Iran (Sureau P, Klein JM, Casals J, et al. Isolation of Thogoto, Wad medani, Wanowrie, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses from ticks of domestic animals in Iran. Ann Virol (Inst Pasteur) 1980;131E:185-200] indicating that the zoonosis is very much entrenched in the tick vectors for many decades.

The reference in the report attributing CCHF cases to illegal livestock trade in to the country is therefore not well sustained. The control of tick infestation in the endemic regions would be an important public health measure to control the emergence of new cases. - Mod.UBA
