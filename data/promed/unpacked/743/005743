An outbreak of avian influenza (AI) has been confirmed in Sunchon, South Pyongan Province [map at http://tinyurl.com/zjfnb3u]. Due to the discovery, Ungok Ranch has reportedly been placed on emergency alert for preventive measures.

Although the state-run Rodong Sinmun newspaper previously ran a story [Thu 29 Dec 2016] about the risks associated with AI and preventative countermeasures, there was no mention of an outbreak within North Korea at the time.

"In mid-December [2016], there was an outbreak of diarrhea among the chickens at a farm village near Sunchon City, South Pyongan [Pyongan-Namdo] Province. After conducting a focused investigation, the Sunchon Veterinary Medical Center declared that the illness was due to AI [known informally as bird flu or avian flu] and initiated a quarantine of the Ungok Farm to prevent the virus spreading," a source in South Pyongan Province told Daily NK [Thu 5 Jan 2017].

The Ungok Ranch occupies a vast tract of land across South Pyongan Province near Anju City and Sunchon City. The farm not only breeds chicken and ducks, but also raises various other types of poultry including pheasant and pigeons, feeding them on special high-quality grasses and weed mixtures. The source went on, "To prevent the spread of AI, the veterinary medical center of the Ministry of Agriculture, as well as the provincial veterinary units have been mobilized to cordon off the farm and are conducting frequent sanitation and sterilization inspections."

A separate source in South Pyongan Province reported that the local hygiene medical centers have been conducting bi-weekly immunity inspections of livestock, vaccinating animals with poor inspection results in order to prevent the spread of infectious diseases including AI. "The city hygiene centers are holding a meeting of the inminban (people's unit) to explain the symptoms of chickens infected with AI to the residents, ordering them to follow hygiene regulations, and encouraging them to gargle with salt water or drink garlic juice to enhance their immunity. They have also banned sales of chicken at the markets," the source said.

"Although the sale of chicken has been prohibited due to the outbreak of AI, chicken meat is still being sold in the markets. The animals that have died of AI have not been destroyed." she noted. "The market price of chicken eggs has also dropped due to the outbreak of AI. Eggs used to be sold at 800-900 KPW (0.87-0.97 USD) but they are now selling for 600 KPW (0.65 USD). Local farmers breeding chickens are in difficult times as the price of chicken meat and eggs has plummeted."

[The above information deserves to be regarded as a reported disease outbreak in poultry in North Korea, suspected to be caused by an avian influenza virus, which requires confirmation or otherwise. In case confirmed, the pathogenicity and serotyping results of the causative virus are to be officially reported.

In 2014, both North and South Korea suffered a serious epizootic of HPAI H5N8 in poultry.

During [March and April 2016], South Korea experienced a limited event (2 outbreaks) caused by HPAI virus H5N8, which was eradicated by stamping-out and declared resolved as of [Thu 7 Apr 2016] (follow-up/final report, submitted 7 Sep 2016, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=20243).

On [Mon 19 Dec 2016], CIDRAP published the following information: "For the 1st time this year, South Korea is reporting that H5N8 [has been recorded] at a chicken farm south of Seoul, according to an official report translated and posted by Avian Flu Diary (AFD), an infectious disease news blog. It's unknown how many birds are infected at this time".

Since [April 2016], only HPAI H5N6 has been reported to the OIE from S Korea.

A RFI by ProMED-mail (20161222.4716700) addressing the said suspected Dec 2016 H5N8 event in S Korea, is pending. - Mod.AS
