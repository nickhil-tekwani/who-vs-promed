18 people have been infected with anthrax at Kaliakore village in Ulapara upazila of Sirajganj in the last 24 hours, according to upazila health complex officials. All the patients are being given treatment at the hospital, while a medical team has been kept alert in the village to identify more patients, said Dr Jafrul Hasan, Ullapara upazila health and family planning officer.

MAR of the village slaughtered a diseased cow on Mon 29 May 2017 and distributed meat among the people, he said. People who came in touch with the meat fell sick, and all of them are infected with anthrax, said the doctor.

[Sirajganj is to the immediate north of Pabna; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirajganj_District.

Clearly, the anthrax season has started in Rajshahi. Considering the repetitiveness of these events, a provincial anthrax control and surveillance programme is overdue and necessary on public health, social, and agricultural priorities. The Sterne anthrax vaccine is certainly one of the cheapest vaccines in the world and very effective. The benefit cost ratio for such a progamme would be very positive and cost effective, and would have widespread rural support and in the smaller market towns; contaminated meat routinely finds its way into street markets. The only way to prevent human anthrax in such non-industrial environments is to vaccinate the livestock, and especially cattle. Once a year in the spring is all you need to do. - Mod.MHJ
