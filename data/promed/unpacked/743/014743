Summary
Report type: Immediate notification (final report)
Date of start of the event: 23 Jul 2014
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 26 Nov 2014
Date event resolved: 26 Nov 2014
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: Sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: Transmissible gastroenteritis virus
Nature of diagnosis: Laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks: 1
Summary of outbreaks Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1(Foco): Rio Cuarto, Rio Cuarto, Cordoba
Date of start of the outbreak: 23 Jul 2014
Outbreak status: Resolved (26 Nov 2014)
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Swine / 463 / 11 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: A commercial swine farm including 86 sows with a total of 423 animals, set up approximately 10 years ago. This is a production holding with a semi-intensive system within 10 ha. of land. Production system: maternity and gestation with a mixed system (free-range and indoors); weaning, fattening, growing and finishing: indoors. Reintroduction of the animals: within the holding or from other holdings. Feed: balanced feed made by the holding itself.

Outbreak statistics:
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Swine / 2.38 percent / 0 percent / 0 percent / 0 percent
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive.
Epidemiological comments: The findings occurred in the framework of the random active surveillance for classical swine fever and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome that the SENASA is carrying out annually. Further to samples and diagnostic tests carried out for these diseases, some sera are processed to detect exotic diseases. For transmissible gastroenteritis, the commercial test kit "Ingezim Corona Diferencial" from Ingenasa laboratory was used. No clinical signs were observed for this disease in the affected holding.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; movement control inside the country; screening; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); no vaccination; treatment of affected animals (supportive care)
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Direction of Laboratories and Technical Control (national laboratory) / Swine / competitive ELISA (c-ELISA) / 26 Nov 2014 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) is an enteric disease of pigs caused by TGE virus (TGEV), a member of the Coronaviridae. Since 1984, a distinct respiratory variant (porcine respiratory coronavirus or PRCV) has spread throughout many parts of the world and is now found in most countries where surveys for it have been conducted, one exception being Oceania. Occurrences of TGE have become more sporadic. The disease is still reported on an occasional basis from parts of Europe, North America and Asia. TGEV multiplies in and damages the enterocytes lining the small intestine, producing villous atrophy and enteritis. Diarrhoea and vomiting occur in pigs of all ages; mortality is highest in neonates. Extra-intestinal sites of virus multiplication include the respiratory tract and mammary tissues, but the virus is most readily isolated from the intestinal tract and from faeces.

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2014, Chapter 2.8.11, Transmissible Gastroenteritis, at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.08.11_TRANSMISSIBLE_GASTRO.pdf.

TGE has no public health implications (http://www.animalhealthaustralia.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/TGE3.1-09FINAL20Sep12.pdf).
