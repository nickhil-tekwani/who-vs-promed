USDA Confirms BSE Tests On U.S. Cows Found Identical To Atypical Cases In
France
-----------------------------------------------
A USDA official confirmed that the positive BSE tests in 2 U.S.-born cattle
were indeed an "atypical" type of the disease.
A USDA spokesman acknowledged Friday [2 Jun 2006] that positive BSE tests
from 2 domestic-born cattle were from a rare strain of the disease found in
a small number of European cases.
BSE, scientifically known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy and commonly
known as mad cow disease, is a degenerative, fatal disease affecting the
central nervous system of adult cattle.
USDA officials have declined in the past to provide such details, but
released information Friday [2 Jun 2006] after a French researcher revealed
earlier this week that the cases in Texas last year 2005 and Alabama last
spring 2006 were identical to "atypical" cases of BSE found in France.
Scientists from around the world are trying to quantify the significance of
these rare cases. They also want to know whether these cases may be sporadic.
In an e-mail, a USDA spokesman said the cases raise "many unanswered
questions about these unusual findings, and additional research is needed
to help characterize the significance -- or lack of significance -- of any
of these findings."
The USDA spokesperson said nothing in the test results of the 2 cattle
justifies any changes in surveillance, disease control or public-health
measures already being taken in the U.S.

Cattle disease might be unknown strain of BSE
-----------------------------------------------
Scientists across Europe and the United States are following the emergence
of a new Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE) in cattle that could
be a new strain of BSE.
Speaking last weekend at an international conference on prion diseases in
domestic livestock (such as BSE in cows and scrapie in sheep and goats),
scientists from France and Italy described how the disease had been
detected in a small number of cattle ranging from 5 to 15 years old.
The strain differs from BSE in that it has a longer incubation time and is
consequently being found in older cattle.
The new strain also demonstrates different characteristics from BSE in
laboratory tests and was originally detected through active surveillance of
live animals rather than during inspection of a suspect fallen animal.
Marion Simmons of the Veterinary Laboratory Agency at Weybridge urged
caution, saying there are not yet sufficient supporting data to suggest
that the disease is a new strain of BSE.

[It has long been debated whether this atypical form is sporadic or whether
the sporadic appearance was an atypical form. There does not seem to be a
good explanation, which simply highlights the need for more research and
understanding of this disease. - Mod.TG]
