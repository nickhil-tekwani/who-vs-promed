An Indonesian man who had been suffering from bird flu for days died early
on Thu 12 Oct 2006, a hospital official said, taking Indonesia's death toll
from the disease to 52.
"He died because of breathing problems which he had suffered since he was
admitted to the hospital," said Hadi Yusuf, who heads the bird flu ward at
Hasan Sadikin hospital in Bandung, West Java's provincial capital. The
government had acknowledged the 20 year old victim as a bird flu case
earlier this week.
The man's brother died with bird flu symptoms on Sunday but due to lack of
testing there has been no positive confirmation he had the disease. A 3rd
sibling, a 15 year old girl, is currently being treated at Hasan Sadikin
hospital. "She is doing allright, no fever. We are still looking into
whether she has [contracted avian influenza virus]. The 3rd testing will be
conducted today," Yusuf told Reuters by phone. Two previous tests have
found [no] trace of bird flu.
Relatives of the three siblings are also being tested. The disease spread
into the family when a member brought chickens with the virus to their house.
Indonesia has more bird flu deaths than any other country. The government
has faced criticism for not doing enough to combat the disease, endemic in
birds in almost all provinces in the archipelago of 17 000 islands. Unlike
other bird flu-affected nations such as Thailand, culling poultry is not
easy in Indonesia because of fierce opposition from farmers and the
logistical difficulties in dealing with millions of backyard fowl. Farmers
oppose culling because of low compensation. However, at times residents of
areas where someone has died of the disease demand aggressive culling by
the government.

[There is some confusion regarding the number of human avian fatalities in
Indonesia. According to WHO Update 34 (see: Avian influenza, human (157):
Indonesia 20060929.2797), as of Thu 28 Sep 2006, the Ministry of Health in
Indonesia confirmed the country's 52nd death from H5N1 avian influenza. A
20 year old man, whose infection was announced on 27 Sep 2006, died early
in the morning of 28 Sep 2006. Of the 68 cases in Indonesia confirmed at
that date in Indonesia, 52 had been fatal. Therefore the 20 year old man
described above, who died on 12 Oct, should be identified as the 53rd
fatality. Currently the WHO cumulative list (11 Oct 2006) indicates 69
cases and 52 deaths (see:
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2006_10_11/en/index.html>).
