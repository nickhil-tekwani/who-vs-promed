--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recently, there have been reports of children with a severe acute form of hepatitis in the UK, Europe, the USA, Israel, and Japan (1). Most patients present with gastrointestinal symptoms and then progress to jaundice and, in some cases, acute liver failure. So far, no common environmental exposures have been found, and an infectious agent remains the most plausible cause. Hepatitis viruses A, B, C, D, and E have not been found in these patients, but 72% of children with severe acute hepatitis in the UK who were tested for an adenovirus had an adenovirus detected, and out of 18 subtyped cases in the UK, all were identified as adenovirus 41F [subgenus F, serotype 41 - Mod.LL] (1,2). This is not an uncommon subtype, and it predominantly affects young children and immunocompromised patients. However, to our knowledge, adenovirus 41F has not previously been reported to cause severe acute hepatitis.

SARS-CoV-2 has been identified in 18% of reported cases in the UK and 11 (11%) of 97 cases in England with available data tested SARS-CoV-2 positive on admission; a further 3 cases had tested positive within the 8 weeks prior to admission (2). Ongoing serological testing is likely to yield greater numbers of children with severe acute hepatitis and previous or current SARS-CoV-2 infection. 11 of 12 of the Israeli patients were reported to have had COVID-19 in recent months (3), and most reported cases of hepatitis were in patients too young to be eligible for COVID-19 vaccinations. SARS-CoV-2 infection can result in viral reservoir formation (4). SARS-CoV-2 viral persistence in the gastrointestinal tract can lead to repeated release of viral proteins across the intestinal epithelium, giving rise to immune activation (5). Such repeated immune activation might be mediated by a superantigen motif within the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that bears resemblance to staphylococcal enterotoxin B (6), triggering broad and non-specific T-cell activation. This superantigen-mediated immune-cell activation has been proposed as a causal mechanism of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (4,7).

Acute hepatitis has been reported in children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome, but co-infection of other viruses was not investigated (8). We hypothesize that the recently reported cases of severe acute hepatitis in children could be a consequence of adenovirus infection with intestinal trophism in children previously infected by SARS-CoV-2 and carrying viral reservoirs (appendix [for the illustration in the appendix, see the source URL above - Mod.LL]). In mice, adenovirus infection sensitizes to subsequent staphylococcal enterotoxin-B-mediated toxic shock, leading to liver failure and death (9). This outcome was explained by adenovirus-induced type-1 immune skewing, which, upon subsequent staphylococcal enterotoxin B administration, led to excessive IFN-γ production and IFN-γ-mediated apoptosis of hepatocytes (9). Translated to the current situation, we suggest that children with acute hepatitis be investigated for SARS-CoV-2 persistence in stool, T-cell receptor skewing, and IFN-γ upregulation, because this could provide evidence of a SARS-CoV-2 superantigen mechanism in an adenovirus-41F-sensitized host. If evidence of superantigen-mediated immune activation is found, immunomodulatory therapies should be considered in children with severe acute hepatitis.

[This correspondence to Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology hypothesizes an adenovirus-caused sensitization to a superantigen motif in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (from a persistent SARS-CoV-2 intestinal focus) and proposes testing of cases to assess for this. As discussed in previous ProMED posts on this potentially lethal severe hepatitis in children, not all cases tested have shown evidence of adenovirus 41 but this could be that plasma rather than whole blood was used, the virus had already cleared (perhaps antibodies against adenovirus 41 would be useful) or that some cases are part of the background "noise" of cases of severe pediatric cases of undiagnosed cause. As the authors state, if this is the case, immunomodulatory therapy should be considered in these cases. - Mod.LL]

Abstract
--------
Although elevated liver enzymes are common in hospitalized children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, pediatric acute liver failure is an uncommon manifestation of COVID-19 disease. We describe the case of a 3-year-old previously healthy female who developed acute liver failure secondary to type 2 autoimmune hepatitis preceded by mild infection with SARS-CoV-2. Testing for viral hepatitis was negative, and the patient did not meet the diagnostic criteria for multisystem inflammatory disease in children (MIS-C). A liver biopsy showed acute submassive hepatocyte necrosis with brisk CD3+ T lymphocyte infiltration and no evidence of fibrosis or chronic liver disease. Treatment with high-dose methylprednisolone resulted in rapid normalization of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), international normalized ratio (INR), and ammonia levels, and liver transplantation was avoided. This case highlights a possible association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent development of autoimmune liver disease presenting with acute liver failure.

[This case report submitted in October 2021 from Cincinnati (Ohio, USA) describes what seems to be a case fitting the case definition of the severe pediatric hepatitis in which the liver pathology was consistent with autoimmune hepatitis developing 2 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection. At the time of admission, the SARS-CoV-2 PCR, as well as IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, were all positive. The adenovirus PCR was negative but it is not specifically stated if the test was done on plasma or whole blood (the latter is reported to be more likely to be positive).

High dose corticosteroid and subsequent azathioprine therapy was associated with resolution. The child did not fit the diagnostic criteria for MIS-C. - Mod.LL]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Objective
While the pediatric population has largely remained free of severe COVID-19, in some cases SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with complications like multiple inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). We mention another unique presentation subsequent to asymptomatic infection of SARS-CoV-2, a unique form of hepatitis designated by us as COVID-19 associated hepatitis in children (CAH-C). The contrasting clinical presentations, temporal association, and viral parameters of CAH-C cases, to the MIS-C cases are presented here.

Methods
As a retrospective and follow-up observational study we reviewed all children testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 during the study period. Children presenting with "sudden onset of hepatitis, elevated transaminases, non-obstructive jaundice, lacking marked inflammatory responses and without evidence of (a) other known causes of acute hepatitis or previous underlying liver disease (b) multi-system involvement" were classified as CAH-C, are described here.

Results
Among 475 children who tested positive, 47 patients presented with hepatitis, 37 patients had features of CAH-C, having symptoms of hepatitis only, with un-elevated inflammatory markers and uneventful recovery following supportive treatment. Whereas remaining 10 MIS-C hepatitis had protracted illness, multiple system involvement, required admission to critical care, and had a mortality of 30%.

Conclusion
With the emergence of newer variants of concern (VOC) including the delta variant which predominated the 2nd wave of infections in India and has now spread to more than 142 countries with changing presentations, CAH-C might be one of them. Cases of such new entities need to be identified early and differentiated from other emerging syndromes in children during the ongoing pandemic for preventing adversities by timely intervention.

[This is a non-peer reviewed preprint which is a retrospective and follow-up observational study of record review from April 2021 to July 2021 at a tertiary care public hospital in central India.

This study period in 2021 is before the earliest cases of the current outbreak of severe pediatric hepatitis (October 2021 to present). The definition for CAH-C used was children aged 14 years or less, with laboratory evidence of recent CoVID-19 presenting with sudden onset of hepatitis, elevated transaminases, non-obstructive jaundice, lacking marked inflammatory responses, and without evidence of (a) other known causes of acute hepatitis or previous underlying liver disease (b) multi-system involvement. At the time of the hepatitis diagnosis, only 2 of the 37 patients were still SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive. All of the 37 patients, as compared to those with hepatitis associated with MIS-C, did well. 3 of 17 of the CAH-C group were adenovirus PCR positive but it is not stated if the source specimen was whole blood or plasma and if those with MIS-C who were tested for adenovirus were positive. While the cases could fit the case definition of the current outbreak, the time period was before that used in the current case definition and the more benign course suggests a different entity. - Mod.LL]
