Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- Austria
------------------------------------------------------------------
On [30 Sep 2014], the National IHR Focal Point for Austria notified WHO via the European Commission's Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) of a laboratory confirmed case of Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection diagnosed in Vienna, Austria. This is the 1st MERS-CoV case in Austria.

Details of the case reported are as follows:
The case is a 29-year-old female citizen of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (SAU), who travelled on [22 Sep 2014] to Vienna, Austria on a flight from Doha, Qatar. She had originally travelled from Affif, SAU, via Riyadh, by car. The case was symptomatic with an upper respiratory infection and fever prior to arrival in Austria.

The patient sought medical treatment in Austria on [24 Sep 2014], and was transferred to a private hospital on [26 Sep 2014] and then, on [28 Sep 2014], to the reference hospital for highly infectious diseases in Vienna. The patient is currently in a stable condition. No exposure to camels or their products, no prior hospital admission, nor contact to a known MERS-CoV case, nor any sick person has been reported.

The MERS-CoV infection was laboratory confirmed on [29 Sep 2014] by RT-PCR targeting 2 distinct targets. A further target was confirmed positive on [30 Sep 2014].

Public health response
----------------------
All of the contacts identified in Austria have been informed about the disease and are being followed up by Austrian health authorities. So far 2 close contacts have presented with upper respiratory symptoms and are admitted to hospital. Laboratory results of these contacts are pending as of [30 Sep 2014].

The Austrian health authorities assume that the patient was infectious prior to, and during the international flights. Follow-up with passengers on the flight is ongoing and personal data of the crew on the flight has been communicated to Qatar.

WHO is facilitating contacts between the IHR NFPs [National Focal Points] of Austria and SAU to allow for exchange of information, and identification and follow-up of contacts of the case in SAU. Contact tracing will depend on the availability of the passenger data.

Globally, 853 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 301 related deaths have officially been reported to WHO.

WHO advice
----------
With the annual pilgrimage of Hajj underway, WHO encourages Member States to review WHO's travel advice on MERS-CoV for pilgrimages, published in June 2014.

Read the travel advice on MERS-CoV for pilgrimages [available at http://who.int/ith/updates/20140603/en/ -- a 3 Jun 2014 document].

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.

Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.

Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- Saudi Arabia
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The National IHR Focal Point of Saudi Arabia has reported additional laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) to WHO.

Between [11 Aug 2014 and 28 Sep 2014], 15 cases of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) including 4 deaths were reported to WHO.

During September 2014, Saudi Arabia reported 11 MERS-CoV cases, including 2 deaths, from Taif (5), Riyadh (3), Najran (1), Jubail (1) and Raniah (1). The median age of the 11 cases is 43 years old (ranging from 27 to 76 years old) and 10 (91 percent) are men. Six cases (55 percent) suffered 1 or more co-morbidities, 2 (18 percent) reported contact with animals (e.g. sheep or camel) or the consumption of raw camel milk, and 4 (36 percent) are reported as healthcare workers or work in healthcare settings.

In August 2014, Saudi Arabia reported 4 MERS-CoV cases, including 2 deaths, from Jubail (2) Riyadh (1), Najran (1). The median age of the 4 cases is 64 years old (ranging from 34 to 72 years old) and all (100 percent) are men. Three cases (75 percent) suffered 1 or more co-morbidities, 2 (50 percent) reported contact with animals or the consumption of raw camel milk, and 1 case (25 percent) is a healthcare worker.

The National IHR Focal Point of Saudi Arabia also notified WHO of the death of 4 MERS-CoV cases previously reported to WHO in June and July 2014. The National IHR Focal Point of Greece has also notified WHO of the death of the Greek patient who had been receiving treatment for MERS-CoV infection in Greece, and was previously reported to WHO.

The total numbers of globally reported cases and deaths have also been updated taking into consideration a review of cases by Member States. Globally, 852 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 301 related deaths have been reported to WHO.

A Saudi woman suffering from Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is assumed to have been infectious when she flew from Doha to Vienna on [22 Sep 2014], the World Health Organization said on Thursday [2 Oct 2014].

The virus, which causes coughing, fever and sometimes fatal pneumonia, has been reported in more than 800 patients, mainly in Saudi Arabia.

"The Austrian health authorities assume that the patient was infectious prior to and during the international flights. Follow-up with passengers on the flight is ongoing and personal data of the crew on the flight has been communicated to Qatar," a WHO statement said.

"All of the contacts identified in Austria have been informed about the disease and are being followed up by Austrian health authorities," it added.

Two of the Saudi patient's close contacts were hospitalized in Vienna with upper respiratory symptoms but Austria's Health Ministry said on Thursday [2 Oct 2014] they had tested negative for MERS.

A 37-year-old Hong Kong man leading a tour group on the flight from Doha had also come into close contact with the patient, but had not shown any symptoms of MERS, said the Hong Kong government.

The man and the 42 members of his group were currently in Poland and would be monitored when they returned to Hong Kong on [4 Oct 2014], the government added.

Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection was contacting Polish health authorities to follow up on the man's [investigation], it said.

The 29-year-old patient had originally traveled by car from Afif in Saudi Arabia, via Riyadh, and had an upper respiratory infection and fever before she arrived in Austria.

She sought medical treatment in Austria on [24 Sep 2014] and was transferred to a private hospital on [26 Sep 2014], then on [28 Sep 2014] to a hospital specializing in highly infectious diseases, where she is in a stable condition.

At least 301 MERS-related deaths have been reported to WHO out of 853 laboratory-confirmed cases since the disease emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012. But the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control says 352 deaths have been reported to public health authorities worldwide, out of 887 confirmed cases.

A WHO Emergency Committee said on Wednesday [1 Oct 2014] that global defenses against MERS needed to be strengthened, especially in Africa, before a likely seasonal resurgence of the disease next spring.

The disease is thought to originate in camels and, aside from travel-related cases, all MERS cases have been confined to the Arabian peninsula, Lebanon, Jordan and Iran.

[The above reports are official confirmation of laboratory-confirmed cases (including deaths) previously reported on ProMED-mail. In the report on the case in Austria, there is the suggestion that there may be secondary cases as this individual was actively ill during the travel from Saudi Arabia to Austria. While there is mention of 2 close contacts who presented with upper respiratory illnesses and have been admitted for testing and monitoring, raising concerns re: possible secondary cases, the media report in [3] states tests for MERS-CoV infection in these contacts were negative. There is also mention the case arrived in Austria with fever and respiratory symptoms, so active tracing of individuals on the same flight is currently underway (and is described in the media report in [3]). In the event there are secondary cases related to travel, these would be the 1st documented in the short history of MERS-CoV.

According to the data presented above, as of 29 Sep 2014, a global total of 853 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 301 related deaths have officially been reported to WHO. This is in contrast with the ECDC assessment published yesterday [1 Oct 2014] mentioning that as of 30 Sep 2014 a total of 887 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV have been reported to public health authorities worldwide, including 352 deaths. The challenge of reconciling information from multiple sources continues.

In the prior ProMED-mail post MERS-CoV (25): Saudi Arabia, Austria ex Saudi Arabia 20140930.2818351, I mentioned in the moderator comment that the female case reported by Austria had come from Medina, one of the holy sites visited by people making a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. That information had come from a CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota) report. A short while ago, Robert Roos, the News Editor of CIDRAP, alerted me of this error and of the corrected information in the WHO report mentioning this woman came from Affif. I am very grateful to Robert Roos for this alert, and apologize for any inconvenience caused by this error.

Affif is located in the Riyadh region/governorate approximately midway between the city of Riyadh and Mecca. The town of Affif was established originally in the early 20th century as a settlement for nomadic tribes in the region, particularly the Utaybah. It now has a population of approximately 40 000 as of the 2004 census (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afif).

For a map of Saudi Arabia, see https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=2826623,131. The location of Affif can be found on the Wikipedia map at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afif. - Mod.MPP]
