Avian influenza in Romania and Turkey: Commission takes
further action
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Commission is taking further action following the
confirmation last night of the presence of avian influenza
H5 virus in Romania and the results from the EU laboratory
this morning indicating that the avian influenza virus in
Turkey is H5N1 closely related to a virus detected in a wild
bird in central Asia a few months ago. The measures will be
discussed at an emergency meeting of the Standing Committee
on the Food Chain and Animal Health in Brussels this
afternoon.
The Commission is adopting today a decision to ban imports
of live birds, poultry meat, and other poultry products from
Romania following new tests by EU experts, which identified
the presence of avian influenza. Imports of live birds and
feathers from Turkey have been banned since Monday following
the finding of avian influenza there.
Further actions decided by EU Health and Consumer Protection
Commissioner Markos Kyprianou are:
a Commission framework decision on preventive measures and
increased biosecurity (hygiene), which will be presented at
today's Committee meeting. Member states will take
appropriate measures to reduce the risk of transmission of
avian influenza. This should include strengthening
biosecurity in poultry farms across the EU and in particular
in high risk areas.
an emergency meeting of experts on avian influenza and
migratory birds will be held tomorrow. The purpose of the
meeting is to evaluate the risk that migratory birds may
pose for the EU. The experts' group will then issue
recommendations on the potential risk for humans in contact
with such birds.
The offer of EU and member state experts to assist Romania,
Turkey, and other countries which are concerned about
suspected cases of avian influenza.
Commission and ECDC advice on precautions to be taken by
people travelling to Romania and Turkey and other countries
where avian influenza has been found.

[In retrospect, the severe precautionary measures, taken by
Turkey and Romania since the initial suspicion of an H5
presence there was raised, seem justified. - Mod.AS]
