Biosecurity Queensland is managing a new Hendra virus case after a positive test result was received late last night [22 Jan 2013] in the Mackay region.

Queensland Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Rick Symons said one horse had died on the property after becoming unwell early this week.

"Biosecurity Queensland is in the process of quarantining the property. There are other horses on the property and we will be working to determine what contact the infected horse had with other animals," Dr Symons said.

"Testing and monitoring will then be undertaken over the next month."

[It seems the Hendra virus continues to strike fear in the heart of every equine owner.

This article does not tell us if there was any exposure to humans or pets.

The vaccine Equivac(R) HeV was announced in November 2012 as ready for market. Is it not widespread in its use? Is the cost scaring some owners? Surely horse owners have heard of this groundbreaking vaccine?

We hope other horses will get vaccinated and prevent this disease.

It would be hoped that owners would pay close attention to their pastures and fence off any fruit trees to diminish the flying fox and horse interaction. The flying foxes are very messy eaters and horses grazing under those trees may surely encounter some saliva or other secretions of the bat. So it seems fencing fruit trees to prevent the horses from being under the trees would be helpful. Vaccinating the horses would provide another layer of protection.

We look forward to hearing more about the vaccine and its successful use in stopping this ongoing terrible situation.
