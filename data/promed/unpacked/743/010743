The Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) reported today [13 Feb 2020] 4 people have been referred to their healthcare providers after being potentially exposed to rabies by a stray cat testing positive for the disease.

The potential exposure occurred 10 Feb 2020 when the victims were potentially exposed by a black and white stray cat near the Celanese Road exit off Interstate 77 in Rock Hill, South Carolina. The stray cat was submitted to DHEC's laboratory for testing on 11 Feb 2020 and was confirmed to have rabies on 13 Feb 2020.

"Rabies is usually transmitted through a bite which allows saliva from an infected animal to be introduced into the body of a person or another animal; however, saliva or neural tissue contact with open wounds or areas such as the eyes, nose or mouth could also potentially transmit rabies," said David Vaughan, Director of DHEC's Onsite Wastewater, Rabies Prevention, and Enforcement Division.

It's important to keep pets up to date on their rabies vaccination, as this is one of the easiest and most effective ways to protect against the disease.

"To reduce the risk of getting rabies, always give wild and stray animals their space," Vaughan said. "If you see an animal in need, avoid touching it and contact someone trained in handling animals, such as your local animal control officer or wildlife rehabilitator."

If you believe yourself, family members or pets have come into contact with this stray cat or another animal potentially having rabies, please call DHEC's Environmental Affairs Rock Hill Office during normal business hours (8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday-Friday). Be sure to immediately wash any part of your body possibly having come into contact with saliva or neural tissue with plenty of soap and water and seek medical attention. To report a bite or exposure on holidays or times outside of normal business hours, please call the DHEC after-hours service number.

This cat is the 1st animal in York County to test positive for rabies in 2020. There have been 13 positive cases of rabid animals statewide this year [2020]. Since 2011, South Carolina has averaged approximately 130 positive cases a year. In 2019, 4 of the 148 confirmed rabies cases in South Carolina were in York County.

Contact information for local Bureau of Environmental Health Services offices is available at <www.scdhec.gov/EAoffices>. For more information on rabies, visit <www.scdhec.gov/rabies> or <www.cdc.gov/rabies>.

[2] USA (Arizona): fox, human exposure

A hiker is being treated after being bitten by a gray fox on Saturday [15 Feb 2020] at Sabino Canyon.

According to Arizona Game and Fish Department (AZGFD), the hiker was treated for rabies at Tucson Medical Center as a precaution. Wildlife officials say the fox may have been illegally fed.

Foxes are among the most common rabies carriers, AZGFD says. You can report wildlife feeding to 800-352-0700. You can remain anonymous.

The animals that reportedly bit 2 people in separate incidents last week tested positive for rabies, the Arizona Game and Fish Department (AZGFD) announced Wednesday [11 Mar 2020].

Last Friday [6 Mar 2020], AZGFD announced a fox bit a person while the individual was hiking in Sabino Canyon the day before.

Another person was bitten on Thursday [5 Mar 2020]. However, this case took place in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Bay and involved a skunk.

Officials said both individuals who were bitten received treatment for rabies at the time of their incidents. On Monday, AZGFD announced the rabies tests in both cases came back positive.

[4] Canada (Victoria Island in the Kitikmeot Region of Nunavut): dog, human exposure

https://cabinradio.ca/32570/news/yellowknife/public-alert-as-dog-at-nwt-spca-tests-positive-for-rabies/


Anyone who came into contact with a dog named Kit at Yellowknife's NWT SPCA this month [March 2020] is being urged to come forward after the dog tested positive for rabies.

Kit, a male husky cross from Cambridge Bay, was featured on Cabin Radio's Pet Project earlier in the month [March 2020]. [Cambridge Bay is a hamlet located on Victoria Island in the Kitikmeot Region of Nunavut, Canada. It is named for Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, while the traditional Inuinnaqtun name for the area is Ikaluktutiak or Iqaluktuttiaq meaning "good fishing place" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Bay. - Mod.TG] However, late last week he developed signs of rabies.

Kit was subsequently euthanized and tested positive for rabies. The dog had been held in a cage outside the main NWT SPCA building for a time and may also have had contact with airline staff while travelling from Cambridge Bay to Yellowknife.

Anyone who thinks they may have had contact with Kit is urged to call Environmental Health at (867) 767-9066, extension 49262, for a risk assessment to determine if treatment for rabies exposure is needed.

One member of Cabin Radio staff has already received treatment having filmed with Kit last week.

Rabies is almost invariably fatal in humans if allowed to develop untreated.

[Rabies is always fatal to unvaccinated animals and without treatment is fatal to humans. If you have been bitten by a rabid animal, wash the wound with copious amounts of soap and water, and seek medical attention right away. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) will likely be needed if the animal tests positive. Antibiotics may also be needed to treat any bacteria from the bite itself. Furthermore, PEP is generally recommended within a specific time post-bite.

PEP consists of a dose of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and rabies vaccine given on the day of the rabies exposure, and then a dose of vaccine given again on days 3, 7, and 14. For people who have never been vaccinated against rabies previously, PEP should always include administration of both HRIG and rabies vaccine. The combination of HRIG and vaccine is recommended for both bite and non-bite exposures, regardless of the interval between exposure and initiation of treatment.

People who have been previously vaccinated or are receiving preexposure vaccination for rabies should receive only vaccine.

Adverse reactions to rabies vaccine and immune globulin are not common. Newer vaccines in use today cause fewer adverse reactions than previously available vaccines. Mild, local reactions to the rabies vaccine, such as pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site, have been reported. Rarely, symptoms such as headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, and dizziness have been reported. Local pain and low-grade fever may follow injection of rabies immune globulin.

The vaccine should be given at recommended intervals for best results. Talk to your doctor or state or local public health officials if you will not be able to have your shots at the recommended interval. Rabies prevention is a serious matter, and changes should not be made in the schedule of doses. Patient assistance programs that provide medications to uninsured or underinsured patients are available for rabies vaccine and immune globulin.

People cannot transmit rabies to other people unless they themselves are sick with rabies. PEP will protect you from developing rabies, and therefore you cannot expose other people to rabies. You can continue to participate in your normal activities (https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/medical_care/index.html).

Only one article here mentions keeping your animals vaccinated against rabies. This is very important to build a barrier between you and this disease. If the animal biting your pet proves to have rabies and your pet is unvaccinated, it generally required for the pet to be euthanized. It is critical to your pet's life to keep them vaccinated against rabies and other preventable diseases.

If states are having trouble with wildlife rabies, especially in certain areas, I wonder if they should consider oral rabies vaccine bait for wildlife? - Mod.TG]

[Sabino Canyon is a popular recreation area located about 16 miles (25.7 km) northeast of Tucson, Arizona (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabino_Canyon).

Victoria Island is a large island in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago; the western third of the island belongs to the Inuvik Region in the Northwest Territories (NWT); the eastern remainder is part of Nunavut's Kitikmeot Region (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Island_(Canada)). Cambridge Bay, with a population of 1766 residents in 2016, is located in the Kitikmeot Region of Nunavut (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Bay). Yellowknife is the capital and largest community in the NWT (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowknife). - Mod.ML
