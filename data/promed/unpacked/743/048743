re: Equine influenza - UK (11): horse, EIV H3N8 Florida clade1, spread 20190717.6571739

We noted in the [above posting] that clarification was sought on whether there had been over 200 "cases" or "outbreaks" of equine influenza (EI) in the UK.

The original source of the information used by Horsetalk (NZ) was the Animal Health Trust (AHT) (https://www.aht.org.uk/news/statement-on-equine-influenza-outbreaks-in-vaccinated-horses); however, this information has unfortunately been misinterpreted. The term "outbreaks" was replaced with "cases" by Horsetalk. Therefore, we can confirm that there have been over 200 laboratory confirmed "outbreaks" of EI in the UK since the beginning of 2019. We report each outbreak on our EI surveillance website (http://www.equiflunet.org.uk) and via Twitter (@equiflunet). We also note that there have been reports of increased EI activity in Europe since late 2018, with the same H3N8 FC1 strain implicated in these outbreaks.

The AHT is an OIE Reference Laboratory for EI, and we carry out surveillance of EI in the UK. We report outbreaks of EI following confirmation by laboratory testing in our diagnostic laboratory, as well as from information received from other collaborating diagnostic laboratories. We define "outbreaks" as discrete foci of infection, usually a premises, which may involve one or many animals. We avoid using the term "case(s)" due to a lack of firm data on the actual number of animals affected. Where multiple animals are reported to be clinically affected, we often receive a sample from only one of the clinically affected animals for laboratory testing.

In the majority of the reported outbreaks, recent movement and mixing of horses, particularly those that have not been vaccinated, has been implicated. This includes attendance by animals that have not been vaccinated at events (here referring broadly to horse gatherings of any kind) that do not mandate EI vaccination as an entry requirement and/or police such a policy. However, in some instances no link to either horse movement or contact has been made, and airborne spread has been assumed.

The AHT has the following advice for veterinary surgeons, horse owners and event organisers that we consider are paramount to stopping the spread of EI in the UK population:

Horses attending events
-----------------------
We reiterate our major concerns regarding future scheduled events that do not require vaccination for attendance and as such our recommendations follow:

1. Ensure all horses attending events are vaccinated. We would strongly advise events accept only horses that have had a booster within the past 6 months (rather than annual) and also enforcing the minimum 5-day rule post-vaccination (interval between last vaccine dose and competition entry to have some benefit from that vaccination).

2. EI vaccination status should ideally be confirmed prior to arrival of all competitors.

3. Ensure there has been no recent history of infectious disease on competitors' home yards before they leave for the event. This could be in the form of a signed health declaration stating this and also ask owners to take and note down the horses temperature prior to travel. Encourage owners to be responsible and aware that even if their own horse appears ok, there is the potential for subclinical influenza infection from other infected horses on their yard.

4. Advise owners on biosecurity at the competition and when they get back to their home premises too. This should include the following:

- Take own equipment, including water buckets and water.
- Avoid communal troughs and do not share any equipment.
- Prevent direct and indirect contact between horses.
- Don't allow horses to graze communal areas.
- Avoid horse-to-horse contact and other people touching your horse.
- Disinfect equipment, vehicles and boots after the event.
- Continue to closely monitor horses for a few weeks after the event, including daily temperature monitoring.
- Encourage owners to contact their vet at the earliest opportunity if they have concerns with their horse.

New arriving horses and good practice at vettings
---------------------------------------------------
The veterinary profession is integral in promoting preventive measures to mitigate infectious disease transmission among all veterinary species, including equines. It is evident from our surveillance data that a very high proportion of the confirmed EI outbreaks this year are as a result of recent new arrivals bringing infection onto premises, either acquired from the exporting premises or during travel. Worryingly, some of these had been noted to be coughing at pre-purchase examination prior to their arrival at the receiving premises and some had received a 1st EI vaccination in the few days preceding the EI diagnosis, with owners perhaps not being aware that a single 1st vaccination would not impart immunity.

Some sensible basic steps are as follows:

1. Isolate animals immediately that develop clinical signs, including raised temperatures, which ideally should be being taken twice daily and systematically recorded so that changes in patterns are immediately obvious.

2. Quarantine all new arrivals, even when a horse appears outwardly healthy, ideally for 21 days, so that if they develop clinical signs they will not pose an infectious risk to the resident population.

3. Discuss the practicalities of isolation/quarantine facilities with your clients, offering advice on how to make an isolation area, even for yards where it appears impossible:

- Use a separate stable (no shared airspace) or paddock with dedicated water source or set aside a stable block or double fence an area of field -- isolate away from walkways, tape around the entrance, use clear signage, have handwashing and foot dip facilities available.
- Ensure the area is a minimum of 10 m (33 feet) from other stables or paddock borders; ideally the further the separation the better, especially for EI; however, it does have to be practical and made use of.
- Make sure that there is no shared airspace with other horses.
- Use separate labelled equipment, a separate muck heap and separate handlers.

4. Ensure new arrivals are vaccinated against EI, remembering that horses will have protection from vaccination only from 2 weeks after the 2nd vaccine dose of the primary course. Make sure owners are aware of this and recommend that owners accept new arrivals only at least 2 weeks after the 2nd vaccination.

5. Discuss further laboratory infectious disease testing of quarantined new arrivals with owners, for example, using serology to confirm a horse is not likely to be a strangles carrier. There may be merit in taking a nasopharyngeal swab from a horse within 48 hours prior to it leaving the exporting premises and testing it for EI by qPCR.

Leading by example
-------------------
Veterinary surgeons must lead by example. For those that have done, currently do or maybe haven't been in farm animal practice since when they were a vet student, you should remember the very high levels of biosecurity compliance that are now expected of a farm vet. Why should equine practice be any different? (By the way, this is a rhetorical question before you rush to tell us why not!)

1. Wherever possible, equine vets should visit suspect infectious disease cases only at the end of the day, as the last call, when not on call that evening. Encourage receptionists to take as much information down about a call and ask them to seek veterinary opinion if they have suspicions a case may be infectious, to see if it can wait until the last call and also ensure the treating vet has all the required equipment in the car, including coveralls, shoe covers, disinfectant (for example, Virkon powder sachets) and the all-important nasopharyngeal swabs and transport media.

2. Obviously all vets have ended up at that call with the horse unexpectedly presenting with overt clinical signs of suspected infectious disease. It is worth having a protocol in place for this eventuality, with appropriate equipment in your car to decontaminate afterwards.

3. Optimise your biosecurity between routine calls, using alcohol hand gel and wiping down stethoscopes as a bare minimum. Perhaps the steering wheel might benefit from a little clean too once in a while!?

4. Discuss with colleagues about biosecurity at the practice and what protocols individuals adopt; identify any loopholes and share and adopt best practices between you.

5. EI has been confirmed this year [2019] on very isolated yards where the horses have not been off site but the owner has had contact with other horses, demonstrating that fomite spread has occurred. Questions worth asking at the practice therefore include the following:

- Do those handling sick in-patients also have their owner horses at home?
- Do staff change clothes between work and seeing their own horses?

[ProMED-mail is grateful to Adam Rash for the above firsthand, comprehensive update of the EIV H3N8 Florida clade 1 (FC1) event in the UK, which started early 2019. This clarifies the media-derived data included in 20190717.6571739.

Subscribers are encouraged to access the continuously updated website of AHT at https://www.aht.org.uk/disease-surveillance/equiflunet. All outbreaks are mapped and included in tables.

According to the most recent update (19 Jul 2019), since 1 Jul 2019, 43 new outbreaks have been confirmed. Each new outbreak is described in detail, including the vaccination status of the affected animals, put on the map and tabled.

Out of the 43 July outbreaks, as of 19 Jul 2019, 35 are known to have involved unvaccinated horses. The details of the 2 most recent outbreaks, included in the update, are the following:

"208. Gwent
On 17 Jul 2019, AHT confirmed an outbreak of EI on a premises in Gwent, south Wales. The one laboratory-confirmed positive is an unvaccinated non-thoroughbred that had clinical signs of coughing and lymph node enlargement. It is reported that the one other horse on the premise has demonstrated similar clinical signs. The likely source of the infection is through direct contact with a group of horses in the next door field that had been noted coughing, but have not been investigated as to the underlying cause. The positive diagnosis was confirmed by PCR on a nasopharyngeal swab.

"209. Lancashire
On 18 Jul 2019, AHT confirmed an outbreak of EI on a premises in Lancashire. The one laboratory-confirmed positive is an unvaccinated non-thoroughbred that had clinical signs of coughing, nasal discharge and pyrexia. It is reported that 2 other horses among approximately 15 horses on the premises have had clinical signs. The likely source of the infection is not known but the majority of horses on the premises are unvaccinated and some animals are believed to have recently attended local events. The positive diagnosis was confirmed by PCR on a nasopharyngeal swab."
