A listeriosis outbreak linked to cheese has killed 1 person in California and sickened 7 in Maryland, including 3 newborns.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Friday [21 Feb 2014] that the outbreak is linked to semi-soft, Latino-style cheese called Cuajada en Terron that is sold from a chain of grocery stores in Maryland.

The cheese was made by Roos Foods of Kenton, Delaware. The Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene issued a warning Wednesday [19 Feb 2014] to avoid products made by Roos Foods, which also sells cheese under the brand names Santa Rosa de Lima, Amigo, Mexicana, Suyapa, La Chapina, and La Purisima Crema Nica.

The CDC did not name the grocery chain linked to the outbreak. The illnesses were diagnosed between [1 Aug 2013] and [27 Nov 2013]. Of the 8 cases, 7 were hospitalized; 5 of the illnesses were related to a pregnancy.

Listeriosis is an infection caused by eating food contaminated with the bacterium _Listeria monocytogenes_. Symptoms include fever and muscle aches and diarrhea. Seniors, pregnant women and newborns are particularly vulnerable to the illness.

In 2011, 33 people died after consuming cantaloupe contaminated with _Listeria_.

A total of 8 persons infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ were reported from 2 states. The number of ill persons identified in each state was as follows: California (1) and Maryland (7); 7 of 8 ill persons were hospitalized. One death was reported in California. And 5 of the illnesses (2 mother-newborn pairs and a newborn) were related to pregnancy. All patients are of Hispanic ethnicity. Investigation into the source of these illnesses is ongoing.

Initial Announcement
--------------------
CDC is collaborating with public health and regulatory officials in several states and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infections (listeriosis). Public health investigators are using data from PulseNet, the national subtyping network of state and local public health laboratories, CDC, and federal food regulatory laboratories that performs molecular surveillance of foodborne infections, to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak. The PulseNet data consists of DNA "fingerprints" of _Listeria_ obtained through testing with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE. We are supplementing PFGE data with whole-genome sequencing. The 5 isolates already sequenced are closely related.

A total of 8 persons infected with the outbreak strain of _L. monocytogenes_ have been reported from 2 states. The number of ill people identified in each state is as follows: California (1), Maryland (7).

Among persons for whom information is available, dates that illness was diagnosed range from [1 Aug 2013] to [27 Nov 2013. Seven of the 8 ill persons were hospitalized. Five of the illnesses were related to a pregnancy; 2 of these were diagnosed in 2 mother-newborn pairs, and 1 in only the newborn. The 3 other illnesses occurred among adults. One death was reported in California. All ill persons were reported to be of Hispanic ethnicity.

The outbreak can be visually described with a chart showing the number of persons who were diagnosed each day. This chart is called an epidemic curve or epi curve. Clinical specimens that were collected after [1 Feb 2014] might not be reported yet due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 3 weeks.

Investigation of the Outbreak
-----------------------------
In interviews, ill persons answered questions about foods consumed and other exposures in the month before becoming ill. All patients in Maryland reported consuming soft or semi-soft Hispanic-style cheese and all shopped at different locations of same food store chain (Chain A). Testing of cheese products collected from Chain A stores was performed in Maryland and Virginia.

Virginia's Division of Consolidated Laboratory Services (DCLS) identified the outbreak strain of _L. monocytogenes_ in a sample of Cuajada en Terron (fresh cheese curd) collected by the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) from a Chain A store. This cheese was likely produced by Roos Foods of Kenton, Delaware, and was later repackaged in the Chain A store. VDACS issued a press release on [15 Feb 2014] instructing persons who purchased this product not to consume the cheese and to discard any remaining product.

VDACS subsequently collected pre-packaged Cuajada en Terron produced by Roos Foods from Chain A that was not repackaged in the store. The Virginia DCLS identified _L. monocytogenes_ from these samples; a consumer advisory was issued on [21 Feb 2014]. DNA fingerprinting and whole-genome sequencing will be performed on these isolates. In addition, the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has tested samples of pre-packaged cheese products purchased at Chain A stores; those products produced by Roos Foods are preliminarily positive for _L. monocytogenes_. On [19 Feb 2014], the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene issued a warning to consumers to not eat any cheese products made by Roos Foods. Their warning stated that Roos Foods cheese products are sold under brand names Santa Rosa de Lima, Amigo, Mexicana, Suyapa, La Chapina, and La Purisima Crema Nica.

[The reports above say that an outbreak in the US of listeriosis linked to semi-soft, Latino-style cheese called Cuajada en Terron has involved 8 people so far including 5 (2 mother-newborn pairs and a newborn) that were related to pregnancy. There has been one fatality. The 5 isolates are closely related on DNA typing. There may be additional cases because of the long incubation period for listeriosis of up to 60 days.

Listeriosis is a worldwide zoonosis caused by _L. monocytogenes_ transmitted to humans who are not newborn infants by ingestion of contaminated food. Infection results in diarrhea and, in some patients, invasive disease that includes bacteremia without an evident focus, meningitis, abscesses in the brain and spinal cord, endocarditis, and intrauterine infection.

Listeriosis was added to the list of nationally notifiable diseases in the US in 2001. Almost all reported cases of listeriosis have invasive infection in which the bacteria spread beyond the gastrointestinal tract. _L. monocytogenes_ isolates, usually from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue from a normally sterile site, or products of conception (e.g., amniotic fluid, placental, or fetal tissue), are forwarded to state public health laboratories for pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) subtyping, the results of which are submitted to PulseNet, the National Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance, to identify clusters of possibly related cases. When PulseNet identifies a cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ patient isolates with the same molecular pattern, epidemiologists conduct a preliminary case-control analysis by comparing responses to food exposures reported on the Listeria Case Report from patients in the cluster to those from patients outside the cluster (http://www.cdc.gov/listeria/surveillance.html).

In the US, the CDC reported 1651 people were sickened by listeriosis during 2009-2011; the average annual incidence was 0.29 cases per 100 000 population, with a case-fatality rate (CFR) (deaths and fetal losses) of 21 percent (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6222a4.htm?s_cid=mm6222a4_w). At least 90 percent of people who get listeriosis are in a high risk group; pregnant women, the fetus and newborns, people 60 years of age or older, and those with compromised immune defenses (such as HIV-infected patients) are most susceptible to invasive disease. Infection during pregnancy can cause fetal loss (miscarriage or stillbirth), preterm delivery, and illness or death in newborn infants. Pregnant women are about 10 times more likely than the general population to get listeriosis and pregnant Hispanic women are about 24 times more likely than the general population to get listeriosis (http://www.cdc.gov/listeria/risk.html). Although the news report tells us newborns were infected in 3 of 5 pregnancy-related illnesses, we are not told the outcome of the pregnancies in the 2 other mothers.

Many outbreaks have been linked to soft cheese made with unpasteurized milk. However, in the period 2009-2011, 5 outbreak investigations by the CDC implicated soft cheeses made from pasteurized milk that the CDC says were likely contaminated during cheese-making (4 implicated Mexican-style cheese, and 1 implicated 2 other types of cheese); 2 outbreaks were linked to raw produce (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6222a4.htm?s_cid=mm6222a4_w). _Listeria_ grows at refrigeration temperatures, so it can thrive when soft cheeses that support its growth have been contaminated.

Cuajada, which means "curdled" in Spanish, is a cheese that is popular in Latin America, especially in El Salvador and Nicaragua. The following is extracted from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuajada and http://www.nicaliving.com/node/1092: Raw milk that is warmed or heated to about 80 degrees C is mixed with rennet, vinegar, or citrus juice and left to curdle. The precipitate is placed in cheesecloth to drain. Cuajada is usually served as dessert with honey and walnuts or sometimes sugar, and, less often, for breakfast with fruit or honey. - Mod.ML
