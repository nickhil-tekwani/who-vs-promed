California state health officials on Fri 20 Apr 2007, announced a
recall in 5 states of frozen ground beef patties after at least 3
Napa County children who ate at Little League baseball snack shacks
were sickened by _E. coli_.
The recall was issued for about 100 000 pounds (45 360 kg.) of frozen
patties produced by Merced-based Richwood Meat Co. Inc. from April to
May 2006, and distributed in California, Arizona, Idaho, Oregon, and
Washington.
The children all fell ill after eating hamburgers at the St. Helena
and Calistoga Little League fields, and have since recovered, said
Karen Smith, Napa County's public health officer. Those cases were
reported on 3-4 Apr 2007 and 2 other possible cases are being
investigated, she said.
The products being recalled are hamburger patties and ground beef
sold under the brands Fireriver, Chef's Pride, Ritz Food, Blackwood
Farms, California Pacific Associates, C&C Distributing, Golbon, and
Richwood.
"Consumers should check their freezers for these products and destroy
them or take them back to place of purchase to ensure they do not
become ill," said Dr. Mark Horton, state public health officer.

An official of the Merced company that distributed hamburger patties
consumed by 3 Napa County children who fell ill earlier in April
2007, after being infected with _E. coli_ bacteria blamed the
contamination on the slaughterhouse that first processed the meat.
About 100 000 pounds (45 360 kg.) of frozen beef were recalled by
Richwood Meat Company after children who ate hamburgers at Little
League concession stands in St. Helena and Calistoga became sick. The
recalled beef came from a batch that Richwood turned into a variety
of products on 28 Apr 2006, and distributed in California, Oregon,
Washington, Idaho, and Arizona, said Steve Wood, vice president of
Richwood.
"_E. coli_ usually comes from the stomach or fecal matter of the cow,
and that comes from the slaughterhouse level," said Wood, who said he
fielded some 300 phone calls Saturday [21 Apr 2007] from consumers
concerned about the recall. Wood, who said he did not know which
slaughterhouse provided the meat, said his company receives raw,
boneless meat from suppliers and then turns it into hamburger patties
and other products. The suppliers, he said, must provide a lab
analysis certifying that the meat is clean when it leaves the
slaughterhouse. But inspectors normally test only small samples of
each batch of meat and can miss a contaminated portion. _E. coli_ can
survive being frozen, health officials said.
Mike Bowman, spokesman for the California Department of Health
Services, said sample tests from the children and from the meat will
be completed Wed 25 Apr 2007.
According to the Napa County Health and Human Services Division, 2
other cases were being investigated. All the children have recovered
fully.
The items under recall are hamburger patties and other ground beef
products sold under the brands Fireriver, Chef's Pride, Ritz Food,
Blackwood Farms, California Pacific Associates, C&C Distributing,
Golbon, and Richwood. Consumers should look for the number "11806" on
the label, meaning it was produced on the 118th day of the year 2006.
Wood said the bacteria would have been killed had the Little League
concessionaires thoroughly cooked the meat. "We're recalling it, but
nobody has turned any in, and we've had no other complaints," he
said. "It's a year old. Most people don't keep hamburger in their
freezer for a year, and most people have the sense to cook it so it's
not rare or raw."

[The most important line in the posting relates to the need for
adequately cooking ground beef. The meat is certainly not sterile and
bacteria will persist in undercooked areas. This is especially true
for organisms like _E. coli_ O157:H7 that require only a small number
of ingested bacteria to cause disease.
Hints to prevent this illness related to ground beef can be found at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/escherichiacoli_g.htm#What%20can%20be%20done%20to%20prevent%20the%20infection>,
and include:
1. Because ground beef can turn brown before disease-causing bacteria
are killed, use a digital instant-read meat thermometer to ensure
thorough cooking. Ground beef should be cooked until a thermometer
inserted into several parts of the patty, including the thickest
part, reads at least 160 deg F (71 deg C). Persons who cook ground
beef without using a thermometer can decrease their risk of illness
by not eating ground beef patties that are still pink in the middle.
2. If you are served an undercooked hamburger or other ground beef
product in a restaurant, send it back for further cooking. You may
want to ask for a new bun and a clean plate, too.
3. Avoid spreading harmful bacteria in your kitchen. Keep raw meat
separate from ready-to-eat foods. Wash hands, counters, and utensils
with hot soapy water after they touch raw meat. Never place cooked
hamburgers or ground beef on the unwashed plate that held raw
patties. Wash meat thermometers in between tests of patties that
require further cooking.

reference also confirms that the strain involved was O157.
