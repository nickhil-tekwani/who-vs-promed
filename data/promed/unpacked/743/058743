Encephalitis deaths in northern India state mount to 950
---------------------------------------------------
With 8 more people succumbing to Japanese encephalitis in northern Indian
state Uttar Pradesh, the death toll from the brain-infecting illness in the
state mounted to 950 on Friday.
The eastern region of the state, where the disease had taken an epidemic
proportion, has witnessed 793 deaths, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
8 people died of encephalitis, and as many as 29 patients were admitted
Friday to a medical college and 7 other hospitals of the region, PTI quoted
Uttar Pradesh additional director (health), C B M Tripathi as saying.
According to Triptahi, a total of 3393 patients have been admitted to the
medical college and hospitals of adjacent districts since the outbreak of
the disease in August this year.
Meanwhile, the awareness campaign in affected areas by the government,
media and several voluntary organizations is continuing in full swing.
Health experts say a specific type of mosquito, _Culex
tritaeniorhynchus_, is responsible for transmitting the disease to humans
from pigs, which are the primary host of the encephalitis virus.
The deadly disease is not new to the state. Ever since the 1st outbreak
took place in 1978, the water-borne infection keeps hitting UP. In 2004,
about 50 people died of the disease in the state.
