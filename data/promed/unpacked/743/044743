[In February 2017, 2 FMD events were reported by South Korea. One was associated with FMD serotype O (see event summary and map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=22735) and the other to FMD serotype A (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=22778).

The current outbreak, which is the 1st detection since those 2017 reports, is located in the same area where the previous FMD serotype A outbreak was reported last year (2017).

According to the information found in the European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease monthly report "Global Foot-and-Mouth Disease Situation," March 2017 ( see, http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/docs/FMD_monthly_reports/2017/March2017.pdf): "Regarding Korea (Rep. of): Field isolates, A/SKR//2017 and O/SKR/ 1 and 2/2017, responsible for the outbreaks that occurred in cattle in Korea (Rep. of) during February 2017 and which were respectively genotyped as A/ASIA/SEA-97 and O/ME-SA/Ind2001d were subjected to VMSD tests:

- Good matching results were obtained with vaccine strains A IRN/2005 and A22 IRQ/24/64 but not for A/MAY/97, A/TUR/20/2006 and A24/Cruzeiro for A/ASIA/SEA-97.
- Good matching results were obtained with vaccine strains O 3039, O 5911, O Campos 04, O Manisa, O SKR and O/TUR/5/09 for O/ME-SA/Ind2001d."
