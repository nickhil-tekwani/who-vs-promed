[Large outbreaks of hand, foot, and mouth disease are not common in the United States. However, in some countries in Asia, outbreaks are large and occur often. Thousands of people may get infected. Some people, particularly young children, may have severe disease requiring hospitalization or even causing death. Travelers to these countries can protect themselves by practicing personal hygiene tips. Below is a typical alert, posted originally in ProMED-MBDS. - Mod.CP]

Bacolod City [capital of Negros Occidental province] in the past few weeks has reported an increasing number of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) cases in both children and adults.

Earlier this year [2015], the Department of Health reported that there was a 175.7 percent increase of HFMD cases compared to last year [2014]. The census showed that 23.7 percent of cases came from Cagayan Valley, followed by 20.1 percent from Calabarzon, then 15.5 percent from Northern Mindanao, 9.6 percent from Metro Manila, and 5.4 percent from Mimaropa.

What is HFMD? It is an infectious viral infection that is caused by enteroviruses, usually by coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) and enterovirus 71 (EV71) and other picornaviruses. Children 1-4 years old are at higher risk of getting the disease, but even older children and adults can be infected.

Symptoms begin with a high grade fever followed by non-specific symptoms of flu, such as malaise, sore throat, and decreased appetite. After one to 2 days, painful sores may start to appear in the mouth. This may be followed by the onset of a non-itchy flat red rash on the palms and soles which may lead to blister formation. These may also appear on the elbows, knees, and buttocks. In some cases, the symptoms are atypical, which makes diagnosis difficult. What is worse is that some people may be asymptomatic and yet may transmit the disease to others.

The culprit virus is found in throat and nose secretions, blister fluid of the skin rash, and even in the feces. Thus, it can easily be spread through the air by sneezing or coughing, by personal contact, contact with feces, and contact with objects that are contaminated by the virus, such as doorknobs, tables, and other surfaces.

A person is considered highly contagious during the 1st week of illness. However, others may remain contagious for days or even weeks after the symptoms are gone.

There is no vaccine against HFMD. Prevention entails healthy, clean practices such as adequate hand washing with soap and water, especially after changing diapers or using the toilet; avoiding close contact (such as hugging, kissing, or sharing utensils) with an HFMD-infected person, and cleaning and disinfecting frequently-touched surfaces, such as doorknobs, tables, chairs, and even children's toys.

As with most viral infections, HFMD has no known cure. Treatment, therefore, is aimed at alleviating symptoms. Pain killers may be given for pain relief; anesthetic mouth spray may be used to numb affected areas of the throat; ill patients should be encouraged to drink lots of water even if their throats hurt.

We must start practicing what we learned with regards to maintaining our cleanliness. After all, to quote Sam Veda, "One who maintains cleanliness keeps away diseases."

[Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is usually a mild disease, but "approximately 10-30 percent of hospitalized cases during EV71-associated HFMD epidemics in Asia have developed a spectrum of central nervous system (CNS) complications, including aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and acute flaccid paralysis.

The most severely affected children can develop fulminant cardio-respiratory failure, which is often fatal and causes a high incidence of severe neurological and possible psycho-behavioral sequelae among survivors, despite intensive care support. Fatal-case children typically experience a brief febrile illness and present with only subtle neurological signs before succumbing dramatically to acute refractory myocardial dysfunction and fulminant pulmonary oedema within hours of developing tachycardia, poor peripheral perfusion, and tachypnea" (http://www.wpro.who.int/publications/docs/GuidancefortheclinicalmanagementofHFMD.pdf).
