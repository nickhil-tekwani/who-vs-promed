Saudi Arabia: Hajj pilgrims need flu shots
-----------------------------------------------
People planning to make the Hajj pilgrimage should get flu shots
beforehand to reduce the risk of a global flu pandemic, say British
doctors. At the end of January 2007, 2 million Muslim pilgrims from
almost every country on earth will converge on Saudi Arabia to visit
Mecca, the final resting place of the Prophet Muhammad.
Although pilgrims see this as a deeply spiritual journey, Aziz
Sheikh, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh, has issued
a warning that such a gathering makes the possibility of a global flu
pandemic much more likely. Overcrowding is common during the Hajj,
and Sheikh said epidemiologists think at least one in 3 pilgrims will
develop respiratory symptoms during their stay. That ratio increases
when pilgrims come from economically developing nations.
Since Saudi authorities already require that people entering the
country for the Hajj bring proof of immunization for meningitis,
Sheikh and his colleagues thought that adding flu shots to the
regimen would not be either inconvenient or unacceptable. They also
suggested tighter surveillance to identify newly emerging flu strains
while pilgrims are in the country and international cooperation
overseen by the World Health Organization to assemble the resources
and logistics that will protect the planet's health.

Hajj and the risk of influenza; a threat that can no longer be ignored
-----------------------------------------------
At the end of next month [January 2007], Saudi Arabia will again host
the Hajj -- the largest annual gathering in the world -- which
attracts more than 2 million pilgrims from almost every country on
earth. For the individual pilgrim, this is a deeply spiritual journey
that represents the culmination of months if not years of
preparation. From a public health perspective, however, such a
gathering makes the possible rampant spread of the influenza virus
and a global pandemic -- which many experts believe is overdue -- a
potentially devastating prospect that has been inadequately prepared for.
Recent work highlighting the high rates of infection and carriage of
influenza virus in pilgrims returning from Mecca has emphasized the
need for internationally agreed to strategies to minimize the risk of
a pandemic. Such a strategy should center on ways to prevent
transmission but must also include facilities for prompt diagnosis
and treatment of infected individuals. No such comprehensive strategy
currently exists.
The Hajj and its associated rites are a once in a lifetime obligation
for people who have the means to undertake the journey. The Hajj
attracts ever increasing numbers of men, women, and children from a
diverse array of ethnic, linguistic, and social backgrounds. Because
the sacred rites are undertaken at the same time, overcrowding is
considerable throughout the 5-day Hajj period. Accommodation is, of
necessity, in tents in the desert plains of Mina and Arafat, and it
is not unusual for 50-100 people to share a tent overnight. Such
overcrowding and continuous close contact greatly increase the spread
of respiratory infections. It has been estimated that more than one
in 3 pilgrims will experience respiratory symptoms during their stay.
The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health has recommended that masks be
used to minimize droplet spread, but many Muslims consider covering
the face during the Hajj to be prohibited. In addition, masks need to
be of a high quality and changed at least every 6 hours to remain
effective, so general compliance with this advice is unlikely.
The Department of Health (for England) does not advise the use of
masks, but frequent hand washing is recommended to reduce spread of
the virus. Given the religious insistence on ritual purity before the
5 daily prayers and other acts of worship, this suggestion should be
acceptable to most pilgrims and relatively easy to implement.
Although the Saudi authorities currently recommend vaccination
against influenza for pilgrims with "high risk" chronic illnesses
such as pre-existing respiratory disorders, data from the United
Kingdom indicate that many such high risk pilgrims remain
un-immunized. The situation is probably far worse among the large
numbers of people coming from the economically developing world.
Given this fact and the risks of a pandemic originating from the
Hajj, mandatory influenza vaccination for all pilgrims should be
considered. Mandatory meningococcal vaccination was introduced after
a meningococcal epidemic among pilgrims and their contacts. As
pilgrims already need to seek medical attention to obtain a
meningococcal vaccination, this extra vaccination should not be too
inconvenient and should be readily acceptable.
Neuraminidase inhibitors can reduce the duration of the illness and
its spread to household contacts. However, 2 practical difficulties
need to be overcome before these drugs can be made available to
pilgrims. Firstly, the high prevalence of general respiratory
symptoms and the absence of state-of-the-art diagnostic testing
facilities make it difficult for infected people to be identified
quickly. Early diagnosis is important for treatment to be effective,
so near patient testing should be more readily available. The 2nd
difficulty lies in the cost of stockpiling sufficient supplies for
the numbers that may be affected and the logistical challenge of
ensuring that household contacts of returning pilgrims are treated promptly.
Virus surveillance studies to identify newly emerging strains are
needed urgently. Currently, Saudi Arabia is not among the 100 centers
around the world where such structured surveillance studies are being
undertaken. The World Health Organization is still developing its
strategy to prevent a possible influenza pandemic. WHO must work with
the Saudi authorities to minimize the risk of the influenza virus
spreading among pilgrims (and the rest of us). A coherent
international response will be needed to ensure that the resources
and logistics are in place so that these strategies can be implemented.

[Details of vaccination requirements and travel advice for pilgrims
intending to participate in the 2007 Hajj are contained in
Eurosurveillance Weekly release (Volume 11, Number 11) of 30 Nov 2006
<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2006/061130.asp#1>.
Hajj, the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, is the largest annual gathering
of its kind in the world. Each year, over 2 million Muslims from
around the world gather in Mecca. The Hajj takes place between the
8th and 13th day of the last month of the Islamic lunar calendar (355
days), and therefore falls at different dates each year. This year's
Hajj will take place between the 29 Dec 2006 and 3 Jan 2007.
The congregation of so many people from different parts of the world
in unavoidably overcrowded conditions within a confined area for a
short period of time presents many public health challenges. The
Saudi authorities take these challenges very seriously and
continually review arrangements to improve the pilgrims' environment.
This year's [2006-2007] vaccination requirements and advice have been
issued by the Saudi Ministry of Hajj for the most serious
communicable disease risks (see: Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Ministry of
Hajj. Saudi Ministry of Health Requirements.
<http://www.hajinformation.com/main/p3001.htm>).
The combination of physical exertion, overcrowding and any
pre-existing health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease,
chronic chest conditions, renal and liver disease, favor local and
possibly international spread of communicable diseases, including
meningococcal infections, influenza, tuberculosis and
gastrointestinal infections.
All Hajj pilgrims are now required to submit proof of vaccination
with the quadrivalent vaccine against meningococcal meningitis types
A, C and W135Y as part of the Hajj visa application to Saudi Arabia.
This vaccine should have been received not more than 3 years and not
less than 10 days before travel to Saudi Arabia and should be
recorded in a vaccination book showing the traveler's full name. All
travelers to Saudi Arabia are advised to ensure their polio
vaccination is up to date. Travelers whose last dose of polio was
more than 10 years ago should receive a booster using the trivalent
tetanus, diphtheria and polio vaccine. All pilgrims should consider
hepatitis B vaccine. One of the rites of Hajj is for men to have
their head shaved. Although the Saudi authorities provide licensed
barbers who use a new blade for each pilgrim, other barbers may not
conform to such standards. Shaving with a previously used blade could
carry a risk of hepatitis B and other blood-borne infections, and so
communal use of a razor or blade to shave each other should be
avoided. Pilgrims should consider taking with them a disposable razor
for this purpose. This will also help to protect against hepatitis C
virus infection. All travelers arriving from countries endemic for
yellow fever must present a valid yellow fever vaccination
certificate in accordance with the International Health Regulations
<http://www.who.int/csr/ihr/en/>. Pilgrims are advised to practice
insect bite avoidance measures, which also protect against other
vector-borne diseases. - Mod.CP]
