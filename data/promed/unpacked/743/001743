A comment re: ProMED-mail Influenza A (H1N1) - worldwide (51): 20090529.1999
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
We read with interest the recent ProMED-mail posting by Bev Paterson
and colleagues [1]. These epidemiologists estimated the reproductive
number (R) for the novel swine-origin influenza A strain (SOIV H1N1)
that caused an outbreak in the St Francis Prep School in New York as
2.7 in that particular school setting. They note that another recent
estimate of R in the community setting, based on events in Mexico in
April 2009, was lower (approximately 1.5) [2].

One potential reason for the discrepancy in estimates of R in these 2
settings relates to the possibility that, notwithstanding the novel
nature of SOIV H1N1, older individuals in the population are
partially protected against infection by prior exposure to
antigenically similar viruses. This is consistent with the young age
of cases reported in Mexico, the United States, Canada, and Japan
[3,4]. Younger age distributions of cases were also noted in the 1918
and 1968 influenza pandemics [5,6], and have been attributed to
early-life exposure to related influenza strains in older individuals
[5].

If indeed older individuals are somewhat protected against infection
with this virus, it becomes easy to reconcile the gap between the 2 R
estimates described above. The R estimated in a young population
(that is, in a school outbreak) should approximate R0 (the
reproductive number in an entirely susceptible population) whereas
the R estimated by Fraser and colleagues would simply be an
"effective R" (Re) in a partially susceptible population.

The relationship between R0 and Re in a well-mixed population is
Re = R0 x S
where S is the proportion of the population susceptible to infection.

Re/R0 in this case would be approximately 0.55, or 55 percent of the
population susceptible. It is interesting to note that approximately
55 percent of the US population, for instance, is younger than age 40
[7]. Individuals older than 40 may have prior exposure to influenza
strains in circulation prior to the 1968 or 1957 pandemics, and such
exposure might confer a degree of protection against infection with
SOIV H1N1.

Increased susceptibility to SOIV H1N1 infection in younger
individuals, relative to older adults, would have several important
epidemiological implications: it would suggest that schools,
universities, military bases, and other areas with large
concentrations of younger individuals will be major foci for SOIV
influenza outbreaks; it would mean that optimal vaccination
strategies (should a vaccine become available) will target younger
adults than are usually targeted in seasonal influenza vaccination
campaigns [6]; and it would mean that low-income countries, which
have "triangular" population distributions (younger individuals
greatly in excess of older individuals) will have attack rates higher
than seen in countries with larger proportions of older individuals.

[ProMED-mail welcomes this comment from David Fisman and colleagues
concerning the estimation of an "effective" R (Re) and its relevance
to vaccination policy should an appropriate SOIV H1N1 vaccine become
available. - Mod.CP]

[Relevant findings from a very recent CDC study were:
"...using stored serum specimens collected during previous vaccine
studies, CDC assessed the level of cross-reactive antibody to the
novel influenza A (H1N1) virus in cohorts of children and adults
before and after they had been
vaccinated with ... influenza season vaccines. The results indicated
that before vaccination, no cross-reactive antibody to the novel
influenza A (H1N1) virus existed among children. Among adults, before
vaccination, cross-reactive
antibody was detected in 6-9 percent of those aged 18-64 years and in
33 percent of those aged greater than 60 years" -- see: Influenza A
