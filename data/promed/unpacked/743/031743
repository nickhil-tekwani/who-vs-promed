The Xian Agricultural Bureau announced on 4 Jan 2007 that "Swine High
Fever Disease" has been brought under control. This disease is not
zoonotic and is not included in the national compulsory vaccination list.
"Swine High Fever Disease" is characterized by high fever, redness of
skin, and respiratory symptoms. The disease is caused by multiple
pathogens and has caused rather large economic losses to the pig
industry. In October 2006, this disease entered Xian through Gaoling
County, spreading to Lintong District, Yanliang District, Weiyang
District, Yanta District, Changan District, Hu County, Zhouzhi County
and 8 other districts and counties, 39 townships and 131 villages. [A
map of the Xian area, in the province Shaanxi, can be seen at
<http://www.chinahighlights.com/xian/map/image/xian-area-map.jpg>].
Total pig stocks in affected villages stood at 13 420 [before the
outbreak]. Disease occurred in 5866 pigs, an incidence rate of 43.7
percent. 2390 pigs died, a mortality rate of 17.8 percent.
After outbreak of the disease, the Xian Agricultural Bureau followed
the spirit of leaders' instructions, repeatedly arranging deployments
and requiring that all districts promptly launch investigations and
surveillance, grasp the situation, and report disease promptly. At
the same time, it launched treatment and implemented safe disposal of
deceased pigs.
Experts repeatedly joined with districts and counties for diagnosis,
prevention and treatment in disease zones. Invitations went to
experts from Shaanxi Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Service,
Northwest Agriculture and Forestry University, the Ministry of
Agriculture's Qingdao Institute of Animal Quarantine and other
research units to conduct dissection, sampling and analysis.
Assistance and guidance was provided to districts and counties for
prevention and control work; prevention and treatment plans were
established and promulgated.
With active adoption of measures by each county and district, this
disease was brought under control in Gaoling, Lintong, Changan, etc.
To prevent this disease from recurring and spreading, the Xian
Agricultural Bureau will take all types of proactive measures,
strengthening the disease fighting ability of pig herds, preventing
purchase and sale of diseased pigs and pork products and strictly
preventing diseased, dead pigs and their products from entering the
commercial realm.

Regarding the Question of Diseased Swine
-----------------------------------------------
Telephone inquiry:
Is there truth to the rumor that many pigs are ill in the cities of
Rongcheng, Wendeng, and Rushan? Can pork on the market be consumed
with confidence? A response is requested from the appropriate department.
The Animal Husbandry Bureau's reply:
From the latter part of October 2006, swine disease entered the
municipality from outside, causing pigs in some of our towns and
villages to fall ill. All municipal animal husbandry and veterinary
agencies viewed the situation with seriousness, undertaking cleaning,
isolation, symptomatic treatment, quarantine supervision and other
work. The disease has already been brought under effective control.
Marketed pork has undergone inspection and can be consumed with confidence.

Week 50 Shandong Pig Market Climbs Again
-----------------------------------------------
11-15 Dec 2006: "Swine High Fever Disease continues in some areas,
and a few areas also have swine influenza. Hopefully, those
associated with pig farming will carefully manage winter breeding,
carefully calculate breeding costs, and avoid losses."

Subscribers are referred to China's report, dated 14 Sep 2006, to the
OIE on "Swine High Fever Disease," included in ProMED-mail's posting
20060924.2732 with Mod.PC's comprehensive commentary.
According to the said report, the disease is related to the mixed
infection of classical swine fever [CSF], porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome [PRRS] and porcine circovirus [PCV-2]. In
addition, some samples were positive for Aujeszky's disease,
_Streptococcus suis_, pasteurellosis and porcine contagious
pleuropneumonia infection. Samples that tested positive for PRRS,
CFS, or PCV-2 accounted for 96.5 percent of the total of the samples
tested. African swine fever [ASF] was excluded.
The said report mentioned the following provinces, affected since the
start of the disease "at the end of June 2006:" Hunan, Jiangxi,
Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Hubei.
The Chinese report to the OIE mentioned also a similar swine disease,
which has been seen during the last few years in some southern
provinces of China. However, it was seasonal, restricted to hot
summers, and affected certain areas along the Yangtze River, mainly
in the provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jangxi, Anhui and Jiagsu. They
claimed that if there is any new detection of the disease, it will be
notified to the OIE immediately.
According to the current internet-derived information (for which Dan
Silver is gratefully acknowledged), "Swine High Fever Disease" has
been recently recorded also in the provinces Shandong and Shaanxi and
is thus still there. As suggested by Mod. PC (see 20060924.2732), we
will continue to refer to this disease as "undiagnosed" rather than
"high fever" disease until a more definitive diagnosis is
established, either as a syndrome resulting from mixed infections
with particular agents or when a definite single agent is identified.
We shall update subscribers if and when new epidemiological or
diagnostic developments regarding this hitherto undiagnosed disease
unfold. - Mod.AS]
