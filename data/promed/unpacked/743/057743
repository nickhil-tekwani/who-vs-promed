Outbreak of Q fever among a group of high school students in
Slovenia, March-April 2007. Euro Surveill 2007; 12(7): E070719.1]
A group of 33 veterinary students and 2 teachers contracted a
laboratory-confirmed Q fever infection during a training course on a
sheep farm in Slovenia in March 2007. The disease is caused by
_Coxiella burnetii_, an intracellular bacterium found worldwide in
various species of farm and domestic animals.
Outbreak investigation
----------------------
On 17 Apr 2007, the Communicable Disease Centre at the National
Public Health Institute was informed about a case of Q fever in an
18-year-old student of a veterinary high school. The patient had
developed high fever and a severe headache on 30 Mar 2007. Chest
x-ray showed pneumonia. The student reported that her classmates in
the same school year had been complaining about similar symptoms.
We suspected that the patient and her schoolmates might have been
exposed to a common source of Q fever when attending a training
course on a sheep farm (Farm A) located in the southwestern part of
Slovenia in March 2007 (1). An epidemiological investigation was
launched involving all 3rd grade students of the veterinary high
school.
Epidemiological and clinical data
---------------------------------
The patient's high school year has 66 students. As part of their
training, 45 of the students spent several hours between 5 and 23 Mar
2007 on Farm A, together with 3 teachers. They were trimming sheep's
feet, disinfecting wounds, and applying intramuscular vitamins and
anti-helminthic injections as a preventive measure to healthy animals
in a stable with approximately 500 sheep. Parturition time of the
sheep on Farm A was from end of January to beginning of March this
year [2007].
We interviewed all individuals who had been at Farm A, and tested
them for Q fever. In addition, 20 students who had not participated
in the training course in March 2007 were included as a control
group. One student from the control group had spent a short time on
Farm A in autumn 2006. All interviewed individuals (68 altogether)
had been in contact with different domestic animals at home and
during school training courses at several locations.
Among 48 exposed individuals, there were 34 (71 percent) with fever
(38 deg C (100.4 deg F) (or more) with or without a headache; 4
individuals (8 percent) had serious headaches only, but were not sure
about fever, and 3 individuals (6 percent) reported symptoms of a
common cold; 7 individuals (15 percent) were asymptomatic. The 1st
person to develop symptoms of fever and headache started to feel ill
on 20 Mar 2007.
Among the 20 control subjects (including the student who had spent a
short time on the sheep farm in autumn 2006), 3 students reported
having a prolonged cough, and one had symptoms of a common cold; 16
(80 percent) students were completely asymptomatic.
Laboratory investigation
------------------------
Serum samples were collected from 63 individuals (93 percent of the
68 interviewees) and sent to the Institute of Microbiology and
Immunology, Medical Faculty in Ljubljana. They were tested by
indirect immunofluorescence (FOCUS diagnostics) for the presence of
IgG and IgM antibodies to _C. burnetii_ phase I and II antigens. A
laboratory-confirmed case of acute Q fever was defined as an
individual with IgM titers higher than 1:16 and/or IgG titers higher
than 1:256.
Overall, the results confirmed acute Q fever in 36 individuals (57
percent of the 63 tested). Serum samples from 26 individuals (41
percent) were negative and the test result of a single sample was
inconclusive.
Of a total of 48 individuals who were exposed on Farm A in March
2007, 44 were tested and 35 of those (80 percent) were seropositive.
They are shown in the Figure by date of onset of symptoms. [To see
the figure, go to the original URL. - Mod.LL]
Of 44 individuals tested, 8 exposed individuals (18 percent) were not
infected, and one had an inconclusive result. In the control group,
none was seropositive, except for the student who visited the sheep
farm in autumn 2006. The serology results of exposed versus
non-exposed individuals are summarised in the Table [refer to
original URL. - Mod.LL]
Among the 36 laboratory-confirmed cases (35 exposed in March 2007 and
one exposed in autumn 2006), 4 were asymptomatic, while the other 32
(89 percent) suffered from high fever, headache, chills, muscle
aches, sweating, and nausea; 25 patients (69 percent) consulted a
physician, and 3 (8 percent) developed radiologically confirmed
pneumonia. Although 13 cases (36 percent) were given antibiotic
treatment, only 6 (16 percent) received adequate antibiotic therapy
with doxycycline, a fluoroquinolone or a macrolide drug. At the time
the treatment was initiated, the laboratory results indicating Q
fever infection were not known.
Conclusion
----------
The data analysis showed a significant statistical correlation
between a positive serological test for _C. burnetii_ and attendance
at the training course on the sheep farm in March 2007 (p value less
than 0.001). There was no significant statistical correlation between
a positive test and attendance at school training courses in other
places or contact with domestic animals at the students' homes. We
concluded that the sheep farm was the source of the Q fever outbreak.
Outbreak control measures
-------------------------
The 1st Q fever outbreak among humans in Slovenia was mentioned in
1954. In 1985, 2 outbreaks were described. The source of one was
contact with a sheep herd; the other occurred among workers at a
tannery, who were probably exposed through contact with sheep hides
(2). Further outbreaks due to contact with infected sheep were
reported in 1991 and 1992 (3,4). Between 1996 and 2005, between 0 and
5 Q fever cases were notified [annually] in Slovenia (5).
The Communicable Disease Centre at the National Public Health
Institute was collaborating with regional epidemiologists from
Ljubljana and Koper, and with the veterinary high school and faculty
of Ljubljana on the outbreak investigation. Further collaboration
with the Department for Infectious Diseases and the Health
Inspectorate at the Ministry of Health, and the Veterinary Office at
the Ministry of Agriculture resulted in a cascade of public health
and veterinary measures.
Public health measures:
-suspension of all student training courses and visits to the sheep farm;
-ban on selling dairy products from the sheep farm;
-improvement of sanitary conditions on the sheep farm;
-serological testing of farm employees;
-workplace risk reassessment (farm employees, forestry workers in the
vicinity), in process;
-serological testing of students who had been trained on the sheep
farm in 2007, final results expected;
-clinical and serological follow up of seropositive human cases, in process.
Veterinary measures (6):
-serological testing of animals at the sheep farm (to date 60 percent
seropositive animals);
-re-introduction of Q fever monitoring in small and large ruminants
proposed by the Veterinary Chamber;
-vaccination of animals considered, vaccine procurement in process.
The regions endemic for Q fever have never been determined in
Slovenia. A joint research project is planned by public health and
veterinary scientists to investigate the burden of disease in animals
and humans, to determine endemic areas of Q fever in order to develop
a sufficient basis for workplace risk assessments, and to determine
the risk for the general population.

Q fever was 1st described in Australia: it was called "Query fever"
because the causative agent was initially unknown. _Coxiella
burnetii_, the causative agent, was discovered in 1937. This organism
is an agent that can be resistant to heat and desiccation and highly
infectious by the aerosol route. A single inhaled organism may produce
clinical illness. Indeed, in [non-human] primates, the dose to kill
50 percent of the primates was found to be 1.7 organisms(1).
Cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_.
Infection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals,
including other species of livestock and in domesticated pets. _C.
burnetii_ does not usually cause clinical disease in these animals,
although abortion in goats and sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_
infection. Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of
infected animals. Most importantly, during birthing the organisms are
shed in high numbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta.
Contact with contaminated wool is known to be a mode of transmission
(2).
The organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common
disinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long
periods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is
associated with compact small cell variants of the organism that are
produced during standard replication along with the less resistant
large cell form, metabolically dormant, and spore-like (3).
Infection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms
from air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried
placental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd
animals. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very
few organisms may be required to cause infection.
Ingestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and
inspiration of the contaminated food, is a less common mode of
transmission. Other modes of transmission to humans, including tick
bites and human-to-human transmission, are rare.
Although not available in many parts of the world, a Q fever vaccine
is often used in high-risk populations such as livestock handlers,
abattoir workers, veterinarians, and laboratory workers working with
animals infected with _C. burnetii_, particularly sheep. The vaccine
(Q-Vax) contains formalin-inactivated phase I organisms and has been
shown to be very effective in preventing Q fever in high-risk
individuals (4, 5). _C. burnetii_ has 2 distinct antigenic phases.
Phase I is pathogenic and is found in infected animals or in nature;
phase II is less pathogenic and is recovered after bacteria are
passaged repeatedly in cell cultures or eggs.
