On 20 Oct 2006, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency confirmed the
presence of the Bois noir (BN) phytoplasma, a pest of quarantine
significance for Canada, in a grapevine at a vineyard in Osoyoos, BC.
The grapevine was imported to Canada in 2006 in a lot of
approximately 2000 plants of the same variety. BN is a serious
phytoplasma disease of grapevines.
Traceback activities have identified the source of the infected
grapevine as a nursery in France, and grapevines in the same imported
lot have been traced to their planting sites. The grapevines at the
facilities involved are under regulatory control and any associated
plants will be disposed of. Traceback activities continue in order to
determine if any other affected grapevines may have been planted in
Canada. The CFIA is taking necessary actions leading to eradication
of this introduced pest.
Current status of the pest in Canada - Under eradication.
Regulatory status of the pest in Canada - Quarantine pest.

A disease that is killing vineyards in Europe has been detected at an
Osoyoos, B.C., vineyard, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency has confirmed.
It's the first time bois noir has been detected in Canada and, while
the disease doesn't pose a risk to humans, it can damage or kill grapevines.
"This is a very, very, very serious thing and my members are scared
silly about it," David Bond, executive director of the Association of
B.C. Winegrowers, told CBC News.
Bois noir is spread by insects, but Bond says that so far, the bugs
known to carry the disease haven't been seen in Canada.
The CFIA has traced the infestation back to a shipment of grapevines
from a nursery in France. The agency says there is no risk of the
disease spreading in winter when plants are dormant.
"The members of my association are very concerned and would hope that
CFIA would demand that these vines be rooted out immediately and
burned - not just mulched but burned - and that the vineyard itself
be quarantined for whatever [period] CFIA thinks is necessary," Bond said.
CFIA Spokesman Chuck Lemmon said Thursday that all 2000 vines in the
shipment will be destroyed. In addition, new rules covering the
importation of vines from France and Germany are scheduled to come
into effect next year.
All imported plants from France will need to be hot-water treated to
kill any potential infection of bois noir, Lemmon said.
Bond said he fears that if the disease spreads, it could have a
disastrous impact on the south Okanagan wine industry.
Tony Murray, spokesperson for the B.C. GrapegrowersAssociation, wants
people to remember that this is an isolated incident.
"Just like in human terms, you have one person who comes down with a
disease doesn't mean to say we're into an epidemic or pandemic," he said.

[The vineyard crop plant grape, _Vitis vinifera_, develops symptoms
of the disease bois noir (BN) when infected by the phytoplasma that
causes the disease, which has also been called stolbur. BN occurs in
France and Germany, but is less serious than other phytoplasma
diseases (referred to as grapevine yellows in North America) such as
flavescence doree. Diseases similar to BN have also been reported in
Switzerland, Italy, Greece, Hungary, Israel, and are suspected to
occur in Chile and South Africa. Symptoms include growth reduction,
leaf discolouration, downward rolling of leaves, and reduced quality
and quantity of fruit. Symptoms are not uniform, and may appear on
some or all shoots of infected vines.
The vector of BN is the planthopper _Hyalesthes obsoletus_. It
prefers herbaceous weeds over grapevines. Bindweed (_Convolvulus
arvensis_) is an important reservoir of BN in Europe. Since the
vector only feeds incidentally on grape, BN is a much slower
spreading disease than flavescence doree. This insect is not known to
occur in Canada and this will be a great aid in current efforts to
eradicate this confirmed introduction of the BN pathogen which was
found in Osoyoos, British Columbia on 20 Oct 2006. This is a 1st
report for Canada.
The 2 postings include an offical announcement from The North
American Plant Protection Organization's (NAPPO) Phytosanitary Alert
System, posted on 24 Nov 2006 and a subsequent report by the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation which contains commentary from affected
growers. This 2nd report was kindly submitted to ProMED-mail by
Brent Barrett, Indianapolis, IN, USA.
