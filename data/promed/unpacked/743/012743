Nigeria: Lassa fever outbreak reported in Edo State
---------------------------------------------------
LAGOS (Mon 9 Feb 2004): An outbreak of Lassa fever, an acute viral illness
of 1 to 4 weeks duration caused by Lassa virus [a negative-strand RNA virus
with a bipartite genome belonging to the family _Arenaviridae_] has been
reported in Nigeria's midwestern state of Edo, the local press indicated on
Mon 9 Feb 2004. Reports said two patients had been confirmed dead at the
Specialist Teaching Hospital in Irrua, Edo state while several others were
suspected to have died without going to hospital for treatment.
The epidemic is said to have affected the northern part of the state,
including Ekpoma, Igarra and Ibilo. The disease, with symptoms at onset
including fever, headache, vomiting, sore throat, nausea, cough and
diarrhoea is transmitted to humans by wild rodents. In severe cases of
Lassa fever, which occurs mostly in West and Central Africa, haemorrhage,
seizures and swelling of neck and face are frequent.
Health minister Eyitayo Lambo confirmed the outbreak, but would not say if
anyone had died. "We have received preliminary reports on the epidemic and
we are responding to it by providing necessary emergency measures," the
minister was quoted as saying. The main methods of control are isolation of
cases, disinfection, surveillance of contacts and rodent control.

[Lassa virus belongs to the old world group of arenaviruses. Like all
arenaviruses these viruses cause persistent infections of rodents
(_Mastomys_ sp. in the case of Lassa virus) usually without obvious signs
of disease. Humans and other animals are infected through contact with
rodent excreta, particularly urine. Cases of Lassa fever are limited to
West Africa and have been reported most frequently from Sierra Leone, and
to a lesser extent from Nigeria, Liberia, and Guinea. In endemic areas of
rural West Africa subclinical infection is common, but occasional outbreaks
with high mortality rates have been recorded. There is also risk of
transmission of disease when unrecognized Lassa fever cases are imported
into non-endemic regions for treatment of haemorrhagic disease. - Mod.CP]
