The Teresina Municipal Health Foundation (FMS), through the Neuroinvasive Syndromes Surveillance program, confirmed the 4th case of West Nile fever in the state of Piaui [PI]. This is a female patient who suffered from acute encephalitis, inflammation of the nervous system, in April 2019.

"The FMS is investigating the possibility of a case acquired in Piaui (an indigenous case). This is because the patient was in the municipalities of Cabeceiras, PI and Lagoa Alegre, PI, in the weeks before the illness. She was admitted to the HUT [Teresina Emergency Hospital] and was discharged after treatment, leaving neurological sequelae ", explains FMS neurologist Marcelo Vieira.

West Nile fever virus is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito, usually of the _Culex_ genus. Natural hosts are some wild birds that act as virus amplifiers and can be a source of infection for mosquitoes. It can also infect humans, horses, primates, and other mammals. There is no person to person transmission.

"Disease prevention is done through measures to minimize the proliferation and contact of mosquitoes with humans. All suspected cases in Teresina are reported and laboratory investigated for West Nile fever, in partnership with the Central Public Health Laboratory of the Piaui and the Evandro Chagas Institute," concludes Marcelo Vieira.

According to Amariles Borba, FMS Health Surveillance Director, the 1st human case was registered in the municipality of Aroeiras do Itaim, PI, in 2014. "Since then, 2 other cases had been confirmed in the municipalities of Picos, PI and Piripiri, PI, both in 2017. Cases in horses have been detected in the states of Ceara, Espirito Santo, and Sao Paulo," she says.

[West Nile virus transmission in Piaui and other states in Brazil, beginning in 2014 has continued. The 2014 date is interesting considering that West Nile virus arrived in North America in 1999 and has taken only 15 years or less to reach Brazil. With cases occurring in several states in Brazil in the past 5 years, it is likely that the virus has become established there. The virus has caused cases in South America earlier than that. West Nile virus (WNV) was first reported in South America in equine animals in Colombia in 2004 and in 2006 in horses in Argentina, 5 and 7 years, respectively, after it was introduced into the Americas in New York in 1999. Owners of equine animals would be wise to vaccinate their animals and human prudent to avoid mosquito bites. - Mod.TY
