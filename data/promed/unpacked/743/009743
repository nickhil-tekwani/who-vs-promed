An outbreak of bovine anthrax has affected a herd of 110 Aberdeen Angus breeding cows, 14 of which died acutely in April 2015 with extravasations of blood from the natural openings.

The owner extracted long bones, which he submitted to 2 separate veterinary diagnostic laboratories, but with discrepant results. Because of this, he extracted a further 3 long bones [presumably from remaining fallen carcasses] and sent them to a 3rd diagnostic laboratory on 12 May 2015. One of those bones, apparently from the 1st animal to die, had a positive isolation of _Bacillus anthracis_. Of the other 2 bones, one was positive, and the other was negative.

There is no evidence that the herd had been vaccinated subject to the recent legal obligations of Resolution No. 115-14 of Law No. 6703-61 of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Province of Buenos Aires.

This estancia is in the Partido of Saladillo close to Polvareda in the Province of Buenos Aires. Saladillo partido/county has suffered sporadic anthrax outbreaks in previous years. It is part of the 30 county "Area de Evaluation de Carbunclo Rural" and comprised some 11 percent of the isolations of _B. anthracis_ during 1977-2014.

Provincial and federal animal health authorities are presently sorting out the problems presented by this outbreak.

[I apologise for the delay in posting this report, but I was at the Diseases in Nature conference in Galveston, and my return to Baton Rouge was challenged by a concert in BR by the popular singer Taylor Swift and related highway traffic.

Our thanks, as ever, to Ramon for this authoritative report. His son Santiago has just presented his parents with a grandchild Joaquin, so our best wishes are doubled.

Buenos Aires Province is working hard to eradicate this disease with compulsory annual vaccination. But like North Dakota, there are those ranchers who forget their obligations, and they become the reminders of why stock should be vaccinated. In each case, the non-vaccinators provide the alerts for the need to continue to vaccinate. Once this sporadic stream of cases stops and stays dead for a few years, one can consider slacking off the regulations. Usually at this point, vaccination is continued for a few years on the ranches with just the latest cases. Then you stop vaccinating, insist on the reporting of any unexpected death, and breath slowly.
