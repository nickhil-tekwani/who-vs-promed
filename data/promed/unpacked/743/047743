Botulism likely cause of deaths at The Lough
--------------------------------------------
A strain of botulism, caused by bacteria emitting lethal toxins, seems
the most likely explanation for the large number of deaths of swans,
ducks and fish at The Lough in Cork.

Cork City Council's chief veterinary officer, Diarmuid Dooge, said
both [wild]fowl and fish would be affected by _Clostridium botulinum_,
a form of bacteria released from spores on the silt bed of the lake.

More than 30 previously healthy swans and ducks and 5 carp are
suspected to have been killed by the toxic bacteria attaching to
vegetation that is eaten by both the birds and fish at the picturesque
wildlife sanctuary.

The sprouting of the spores, and the subsequent release of toxins that
attack the fish and birds' central nervous systems [In fact, the
peripheral nervous system is affected. - Mod.AS], may be attributed to
the recent humidity and a lowering of the water level. These
conditions will have encouraged the bacteria to "flower."

It was initially thought that a virus had been transmitted to the
resident fowl by a wild duck. But that has been ruled out following
tests at the Regional Veterinary Laboratory at Model Farm Road. Avian
influenza, more commonly known as the dreaded bird flu, was also
quickly ruled out, leaving _Clostridium botulinum_ as the likely
culprit.

Mr Dooge said it was vital that all carcasses were removed from the
water and the central island as quickly as possible to prevent the
lethal disease from attacking more wildlife. He predicted more fowl
would die before the situation was brought under control. "It is vital
we continue to remove all dead and dying birds. If maggots get onto a
carcass they will concentrate the toxins and make them easier to
spread," he said.

As there is no laboratory in Ireland equipped to confirm cases of
botulism -- commonly known as a potentially lethal strain of food
poisoning -- samples will have to be sent to Scotland and it is
expected it will take days before the results are known. "We need
confirmation of this. We need a scientific explanation," Mr Dooge said.

He has also called in the aquatic services section at University
College Cork to analyse the water quality at the 9-acre lake near
Togher. "It fits the pattern of _Clostridium botulinum_ as both ducks
and fish are susceptible to it. We want to get on top of this as soon
as possible. It is a dreadful situation," Mr Dooge said.

The chief veterinary officer has also held discussions on the problem
with the coarse angling club, which stocks the lake. The Lough is one
of the premier carp fisheries in Ireland. About 2000 carp are in the
lake and it attracts thousands of coarse anglers every year, providing
a welcome financial boost to the local economy.

[We are grateful to Dr Honhold for forwarding the above newswire,
further to our RFI of Tue 7 Jul 2009.

Botulism in waterfowl is generally caused by one of 2 toxin types.
Type E toxin is found primarily in decaying fish and causes
intoxication in those feeding on them. It may also cause intoxication
in humans.

Type C toxin, on the other hand, is not related to fish. It occurs in
carcasses of dead invertebrates, in the flesh of birds dying of
botulism, and in maggots feeding on toxic carcasses. Type C, which is
regarded as responsible for most outbreaks in waterfowl world-wide,
does not pose a risk to humans.

Laboratory identification of the causative toxin in the Cork lake
outbreak is anticipated soon.
