A tick that carries Lyme disease has been found in twice as many areas in the country as a decade ago, new figures reveal. A study from Public Health England (PHE) found that numbers of the castor bean tick _Ixodes ricinus_, the main carrier of the infection, were up thanks to warmer weather that helped the bug thrive. Their figures were based on their tick surveillance scheme, which relies on reports of tick sightings from vets and members of the public.

The study, published in the journal Ticks and Tick-borne Diseases found numbers of the _I. ricinus_ tick has risen from fewer than 200 in 2006 to more than 700 in 2016 [1]. PHE's reporting system breaks the country into 2864 grid squares measuring 6.2 mi [approx 10 km] and the _I. ricinus_ tick has been spotted in 780 squares, including 548 where it had not been seen before 2010. The majority of new sightings have been in southern England, with smaller clusters in Scotland, northwest Wales and northeast England. Greater London also has a dense population, with the _I. ricinus_ tick spotted in 80 per cent of its grid squares. PHE believes the rise in sightings may also be down to greater awareness of the bug.

Lyme disease is a bacterial infection, spread by ticks, which can cause rashes, headaches, muscle pain and inflammation of the spinal cord. Most people develop a distinctive red rash the shape of a circle with a ring around it between 3 and 30 days after they were bitten.

Benjamin Cull, emerging infections scientist at PHE and the study's lead author, said: "The number of 10 km [approx 6 mi] grid squares with a record of _I. ricinus_ and in some areas the proportion of 10 km squares has increased. The increase in awareness and reporting is likely to contribute to this, although in some areas it may indicate that ticks may be moving to new areas. "

Katherine Russell, a PHE expert on animal-borne infections, added: "Just because this study has reported increased numbers of _I. ricinus_ ticks, this does not mean that all of these ticks will carry _Borrelia burgdorferi_, which causes Lyme disease. Additionally, not all tick bites will result in an infection with Lyme disease. There are many simple ways in which people can protect themselves, for example by walking on clearly defined paths, using insect repellent and performing regular tick checks. Ticks can safely be removed with tweezers or a tick removal tool."

PHE advises anyone who feels unwell after being bitten by a tick should speak to their GP.

Abstract
--------
"Public Health England's passive Tick Surveillance Scheme (TSS) records the distribution, seasonality and host associations of ticks submitted from across the United Kingdom (UK), and helps to inform the UK government on emerging tick-borne disease risks. Here we summaries data collected through surveillance during 2010-2016, and compare with previous TSS data from 2005 to 2009, particularly in relation to the primary Lyme borreliosis vector _Ixodes ricinus_. A total of 4173 records were submitted, constituting over 14 000 ticks; 97 percent were endemic tick records (13 833 ticks of 11 species), with an additional 97 records of imported ticks (438 ticks of 17 species). Tick submissions were mainly from veterinary professionals (n equal 1954; 46.8 percent) and members of the public and amateur entomologists (n equal 1600; 38.3 percent), as well as from academic institutions (n equal 249; 6.0 percent), wildlife groups (n equal 239; 5.7 percent) and health professionals (n equal 131; 3.1 percent). The most commonly reported hosts of endemic ticks were dogs (n equal 1593; 39.1 percent of all records), humans (n equal 835; 20.5 percent) and cats (n equal 569; 14 percent). New host associations were recorded for a number of tick species. _Ixodes ricinus_ was the most frequently recorded endemic tick species (n equal 2413; 59.2 percent of all records), followed by _I. hexagonus_ (n equal 1355; 33.2 percent), _I. canisuga_ (n equal 132; 3.2 percent) and _I. frontalis_ (n equal 56; 1.4 percent), with other species each making up to less than 1 percent total records. As many as 81 percent of _I. ricinus_ recorded from humans were nymphs, whereas 93.4 percent of _I. ricinus_ from companion animals were adults. Recent TSS records of _I. ricinus_ in the UK add a considerable amount of new presence data for this species, particularly in the southern regions of England, and confirm that this species is widespread across the UK. The scheme remains a valuable method of collecting continuous national distribution data on ticks from a variety of host species."

Lyme disease is the most common human tickborne infectious disease in the northern hemisphere, occurring predominately in temperate regions of North America, Europe, and Asia. Lyme disease is caused by pathogenic genospecies of the spirochete, _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato complex, a genetically diverse group of spirochetes (http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/content/42/3/378.full.pdf). Vectors of _B. burgdorferi_ are hard-bodied _Ixodes_ ticks, and various small- and medium-sized mammals and ground-feeding bird species are reservoir-competent hosts. However, the species of tick vector, the reservoir host species, borrelial genospecies, and carriage rates of borreliae in ticks all vary according to the geographical location. The patterns of disease also differ by geographical location. For example, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans and neuroborreliosis are more common in Europe, whereas arthritis appears to be prevalent in the United States.

At least 3 species of the _B. burgdorferi_ sensu lato complex (_B. afzelii_, _B. garinii_, and _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto) are known to cause Lyme disease in humans. _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto is the most common pathogenic species to cause Lyme disease in North America. In Europe, _B. garinii_ and _B. afzelii_ are much commoner than _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto. _Ixodes scapularis_ is the vector in the eastern and north-central United States and _Ixodes ricinus_ in Europe.

Incidence of Lyme disease acquired in England and Wales remains low compared with some other European countries or the U.S. Public Health England (PHE) recorded between 950 and 1050 cases annually in England and Wales (2011 to 2013), with an incidence of 1.8 cases per 100 000 population (http://vscg.org/good-practice/published/ticks-and-lyme-disease). Incidence rates are higher in Scotland; Health Protection Scotland recorded between 228 and 308 cases annually (2007 to 2011), with an incidence of 4.3 cases per 100 000 population (http://vscg.org/good-practice/published/ticks-and-lyme-disease). However, because of under-reporting, the true incidence is estimated to be 2-3 times higher.

Areas inhabited by deer are particularly suitable habitats for _Ixodes_ ticks. Deer, although not susceptible to Lyme disease, supply the adult tick with a required blood meal.

A map of the areas in the UK where _I. ricinus_ have been found is available at the source URL. Most cases of Lyme disease in humans are associated with nymphal stage tick bites. The PHE study above found that 81 percent of _I. ricinus_ recorded from humans were nymphs. It is important to know not only the abundance of nymphs, but also the frequency of _I. ricinus_ nymphs infected with _Borrelia burgdorferi_ in particular areas in the UK (http://jcm.asm.org/content/36/5/1240.full). In the U.S., the prevalence of _B. burgdorferi_ -infected nymphal _I. scapularis_ ticks commonly ranges between 20 percent and 40 percent in areas of endemicity in the Northeastern and upper Midwestern United States; however, _I. pacificus_ ticks (the vector for Lyme disease in the western United States) have a much lower infection rate with _B. burgdorferi_ (0 percent to 14 percent) (https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/43/9/1089/422463). - Mod.ML
