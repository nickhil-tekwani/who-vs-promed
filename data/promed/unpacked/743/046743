H5N1/H1N1 VIRUS CO-INFECTION - EGYPT (02): ex SAUDI ARABIA, NOT, CORRECTION

Both the Egyptian Ministry of Health & CDC now concur that the
dual-infected patient hospitalized in Egypt did not have avian (H5N1)
together with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus (see 1st ProMED ref. below).
The co-infection was with seasonal H3N2 virus.

I introduced an error into Mod.CP's comment. The relevant sentence
should read
"It now appears that the co-infection is believed to be between 2 low
virulence viruses (pandemic H1N1 & H3N2) and *not* between a highly
virulent, poorly transmissible, virus (pandemic H5N1) and a highly
transmissible strain of low virulence (H1N1)..."

I regret adding to the confusion.
