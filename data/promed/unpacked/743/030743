Abstract
--------
In mid-July 2013, an outbreak of peste des petits ruminants (PPR) was observed in a herd of camels after they were imported from Kuwait to the Khuzestan province in southwest of Iran. The clinical signs of the affected animals included sudden death, fever, oral erosion, and ecthyma-like lesions, yellowish diarrhea, pneumonia and respiratory distress, enlargement of lymph node, severe dehydration, dermatitis, ulcerative keratitis, and conjunctivitis. Necropsy findings included keratoconjunctivitis, congestion and consolidation of the lung, paleness of the liver, and enlargement and edema of lymph nodes. Histopathological exam revealed degeneration and acute hyperemia of the lungs, fatty change and necrotic foci in the liver, tubular necrosis in the kidneys, and necrotic dermatitis. We used immunocapture enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to confirm PPR virus (PPRV) and differentiate it from rinderpest virus. Then virus genome was studied by molecular analysis for detecting of strain and substrain of the virus. Immunocapture ELISA of all specimens reacted positively against PPRV antigens. Also, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results in the lung and lymph nodes of the dead camels consolidated the cause of disease to be PPRV.

The present study is the 1st report of the PPRV outbreak in camels in Iran.

Discussion
----------
[The full article and references are available at the source URL above; subscription required.]

Clinical signs, history taking, gross lesions, and laboratory findings confirmed the etiology of the observed condition in the camels in the affected region to be PPRV. PPR was first reported in 1995 in small ruminants from a western province in Iran. The disease was later reported from most provinces (n = 28) over a period of 10 years. Latter studies revealed that the Iranian PPRV isolates belong to lineage IV and are closely related to the Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, India, Tajikistan, and Chinese isolates.

Iran is bordered to the east by Pakistan and to the west by Turkey. PPRV infection has been reported in the south eastern Turkey, near the Iranian border. Sharing border between mentioned countries is probably the most important cause of PPRV transmission and spread in Iran. In this study, according to the time of entering of the camel herd to Khuzestan province (2 weeks before the emergence of the disease), incubation period of PPR, existence of disease in small ruminant flocks of Krit camp, as well as results of RT-PCR (homology by Iranian sub-strain), it can be concluded that the imported herd has been infected in Iran.

Most of clinical signs in the present study were very similar to those of small ruminants except for oral lesions, which were very milder in camel. One of the most remarkable clinical signs that were observed in the current outbreak was ulcerative keratitis and conjunctivitis, which had previously been reported in wild small ruminants. Multifocal necrotic foci, described in goats with PPR, were also observed in the liver of camels in recent study.

Observation of leukopenia with lymphopenia in this report confirmed the hypothesis that PPRV causes marked immunosuppression.

Leukopenia is observed generally from the 4th day post-infection and may revert depending on the progression of disease. Hyperfibrinogenemia, which was found in this outbreak, may occur in any other inflammatory conditions, because fibrinogen is an acute-phase protein and is used in veterinary medicine as an inflammatory marker.

In the current outbreak, immunocapture ELISA was used for detection of PPR viral antigen and also to differentiate between rinderpest and PPR viruses. According to Abraham G and Berhan A [see reference 1 below], antigen capture ELISA is less time-consuming, more sensitive, and specific than the agar gel immunodiffusion. In addition, RT-PCR revealed amplified sequences of PPR viral genome as well identified from tissue culture isolates that were recovered from these samples.

This is the 1st report of PPR in a camel herd in Iran, which could be an important alarm for spread of the disease to other unusual hosts if animal movements, quarantine, and regular vaccinations are neglected.

A list of 'significant viral diseases of camelids' is presented on OIE's website at http://www.oie.int/our-scientific-expertise/specific-information-and-recommendations/camelidae-diseases/. They are divided into 3 groups:
Group I = "known to produce significant diseases": camelpox, contagious ecthyma, papillomatosis, rabies, RVF [Rift Valley fever];
Group II = "diseases for which camelids are potential pathogen carriers": African horse sickness, bluetongue, BVD [bovine viral diarrhea], PPR;
Group III = "minor diseases": CCHF [Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever], herpesvirus infections (EHV, IBR [Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis]), West Nile fever.

Detailed background of the said information, as compiled by OIE's ad-hoc group for camelid diseases in 2010, is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Our_scientific_expertise/docs/pdf/A_Diseases_Camelids_May10.pdf.

In view of the recent report from Iran and an earlier report from Sudan (see reference 2, below) describing a serious clinical disease caused by PPR virus in dromedary camels, the place (group) of PPR within OIE's list may deserve reconsideration. OIE is holding during the current week its 84th annual General Session in Paris.

Recently, an undiagnosed lethal disease of dromedary camels has been reported from Pakistan, Iran's eastern neighbor and a country the camel population of which ranks 6th globally. PPR has been one of the main suspects, requested information pending (see 20160521.4237105).
