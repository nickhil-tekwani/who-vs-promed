Compendium of Measures To Control _Chlamydia psittaci_ Infection Among
Humans (Psittacosis) and Pet Birds (Avian Chlamydiosis), 1998
Summary: Psittacosis --- also known as parrot disease, parrot fever, and
ornithosis --- can cause severe pneumonia and other serious health
problems among humans. Approximately 800 cases of psittacosis (infection
with _Chlamydia psittaci_) were reported to CDC from 1987 through 1996,
and most resulted from exposure to pet birds, usually parrots, macaws,
cockatiels, and parakeets. In birds, _C. psittaci_ infection is referred
to as avian chlamydiosis (AC). Infected birds shed the bacteria through
feces and nasal discharges, which can remain infectious for several
months. This compendium provides information about psittacosis and AC to
public health officials, physicians, veterinarians, members of the pet
bird industry, and others concerned about controlling these diseases and
protecting public health. The recommendations in this compendium provide
effective, standardized procedures for controlling AC in birds, a vital
step to protecting human health.
Introduction: _Chlamydia psittaci_ is a bacterium that can be transmitted
from pet birds to humans. In humans, the resulting infection is referred
to as psittacosis (also known as parrot disease, parrot fever, and
ornithosis). Psittacosis often causes influenza-like symptoms and can
lead to severe pneumonia and nonrespiratory health problems. With proper
treatment, the disease is rarely fatal. From 1987 through 1996, CDC
received reports of 831 cases of psittacosis, which is an underestimate
of the actual number of cases because psittacosis is difficult to
diagnose.
During the 1980s, approximately 70% of the psittacosis cases with a
known source of infection resulted from human exposure to caged pet
birds; of these persons, the largest group affected (43%) included bird
fanciers and owners of pet birds. Pet shop employees accounted for an
additional 10% of cases. Other persons at risk include pigeon fanciers
and persons whose occupation places them at risk for exposure (e.g.,
employees in poultry slaughtering and processing plants, veterinarians,
veterinary technicians, laboratory workers, workers in avian quarantine
stations, farmers, and zoo workers). Because human infection can result
from brief, passing exposure to infected birds or their contaminated
droppings, persons with no identified leisure-time or occupational risk
can become infected.
In this report, _C. psittaci_ infection in birds is referred to as avian
chlamydiosis (AC). The bacterium _C. psittaci_ has been isolated from
approximately 100 bird species and is most commonly identified in
psittacine birds such as parrots, macaws, cockatiels, and parakeets.
Among caged, non psittacine birds, infection with _C. psittaci_ occurs most
frequently in pigeons, doves, and mynah birds. The incidence of
infection in canaries and finches is believed to be lower than in other
psittacine birds.
The recommendations in this compendium provide effective, standardized
procedures for controlling AC in the pet bird population, an essential
step in efforts to control psittacosis among humans. This compendium is
intended to guide public health officials, physicians, veterinarians,
persons in the pet bird industry, and others concerned with the control
of _C. psittaci_ infection and the protection of public health.
