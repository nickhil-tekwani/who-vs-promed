[With just one new case, the incidence of Lassa fever cases is slowing and perhaps ending for this transmission season, although the Lassa fever virus transmission season usually lasts into June, so a few more cases might occur. The graphs of the epidemic curves continue to indicate that the peak number of cases nationally has passed. No new cases have occurred over the past week. The follow-up of thousands of contacts with so few uncontacted is remarkable. As noted in previous comments, providing adequate surveillance and timely treatment over such a large geographic area is challenging. Fortunately, there is international help participating in treatment and surveillance. No additional health care people have been confirmed as infected during this week, but a suspected case in a laboratory worker is reported below.

The maps and graphs in the report above are interesting and provide a good picture of how the outbreak has progressed over time. They can be accessed at the source URL above.
