Residents of Sirba locality in West Darfur [state, Sudan] complain about expired anti-malarial medicines being sold on the market.

"The people are worried about the high mortality rate among malaria patients these days. The most recent victims died on Tuesday [2 Dec 2014]," the coordinator of the Sirba camps for the displaced told Radio Dabanga. "They had been treated with medicines bought from a trader from Nierteti in Central Darfur."

"Apart from expired anti-malarial medicines, also fake medicines are sold on the market." The coordinator demanded the West Darfur state Ministry of Health to launch a campaign "to fight the fake and expired medicines' traders, and provide the state with officially approved medicines."

[It is a well known problem that expired medicine from industrialized countries may end up in developing countries. The lack of control of imported drugs and lack of resources to enforce national legislation is a problem.

The post also mentions falsified (also known as counterfeit) medicines, and this is also a well known problem in Africa and Southeast Asia. The problem has recently been discussed (Newton PN et al. Falsified medicines in Africa: all talk, no action. Lancet Glob Health. 2014;2:e509-10). - Mod.EP
