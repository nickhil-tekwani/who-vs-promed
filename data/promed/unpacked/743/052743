Since the last weekend (24-25 Dec 2011), the Animal Health Center of
Flanders (DGZ Vlaanderen) received several fetuses/lambs from possible
"Schmallenberg virus [MBV] suspected" ovine farms for postmortem
examinations. In some lambs, arthrogryposis, torticollis, scoliosis
and severe brain abnormalities were observed, such as hydranencephaly
or hypoplasia. The observed histologic lesions in the central nervous
system were strongly suggestive of infection with a teratogenic
virus.

Brain tissues were sent to the Belgian reference laboratory for animal
disease (CODA-CERVA). On 28 Dec 2011; brain samples from 12 lambs were
tested by the CODA-CERVA; the Schmallenberg virus was detected in
brain tissue by RT-PCR (FLI, Germany) in 7 lambs originating from 5
different farms from the province of Eastern-Flanders.

[The above update from a first hand authoritative source is gratefully
acknowledged.

Notably so far, congenital malformations have been reported in Belgium
from sheep farms. Past outbreaks of congenital malformations in
ruminants which were attributed to orthobunyavirus (e.g. Akabane and
Akabane-like syndromes) typically started with arthrogrypotic changes
in calves (born to cows infected during the last semester of their
pregnancy), followed by waves of malformed lambs born to ewes infected
during the 1st semester of pregnancy, while the final stage of the
"outbreak" would be characterised by the appearance of CNS-damaged
calves, born to cows infected during earlier stages of their
pregnancy.

It will be interesting to see what sequential pattern is demonstrated
by the unfolding German/Dutch/Belgian MBV episode. In one sense, this
event has already shown a significant difference: the reported
appearance of (mild and ephemeral) clinical signs in bovines
(August/September 2011). If cows in late pregnancy were included, if
trans-placental infection took place, and if MBV is Akabane-like, then
arthrogrypotic calves should have already appeared. Akabane and
Akabane-like virus infection is traditionally known to be subclinical
in the adult population.

EU's Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH;
Section Animal Health and Welfare) is due to hold its next meeting on
11-12 Jan 2012; MBV will certainly be one of the topics to be
presented and discussed. An initial presentation on the early German
observations and findings was discussed during the 6 Dec 2011 meeting;
