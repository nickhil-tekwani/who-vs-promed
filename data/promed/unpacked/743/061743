The Department of Primary Industries (DPI) says some stations in
western Queensland have reported more than 100 cattle deaths due to
botulism outbreaks.
Veterinarians say the extended drought and a lack of protein and
phosphorous in diets are among the reasons for the high number of
deaths, with cattle foraging for bones and carcasses where botulism
bacteria live.
The DPI's Binendra Pratap says vaccination can prevent the disease.
"In the last 6 to 9 months we have been recording very high
incidences of these deaths ... they are probably losing 5 or 6
animals per property, up to 100 animals per property ... usually
these are the larger animals which are close to market age ... all
these deaths have occurred on properties which have not been vaccinated."

[Certainly, the authorities must know which type of botulism is
affecting the stations or they would not be recommending vaccination.
It would be appreciated if the authorities would inform us of the
type of botulism is present. Generally it is type C or D in animals. - Mod.TG]
