Widespread outbreaks of hepatitis A across the United States
------------------------------------------------------------
Since March 2017, CDC's Division of Viral Hepatitis (DVH) has been assisting multiple state and local health departments with hepatitis A outbreaks, spread through person-to-person contact.

The hepatitis A vaccine is the best way to prevent HAV infection
- The following groups are at highest risk for acquiring HAV infection or developing serious complications from HAV infection in these outbreaks and should be offered the hepatitis A vaccine in order to prevent or control an outbreak: people who use drugs (injection or non-injection); people experiencing unstable housing or homelessness; men who have sex with men (MSM); people who are currently or were recently incarcerated; people with chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C.
- One dose of single-antigen hepatitis A vaccine has been shown to control outbreaks of hepatitis A and provides up to 95% seroprotection in healthy individuals for up to 11 years.
- Pre-vaccination serologic testing is not required to administer hepatitis A vaccine. Vaccinations should not be postponed if vaccination history cannot be obtained or records are unavailable.

1."Outbreak-associated" status is currently determined at the state level in accordance with each state's respective outbreak case definition.
2.Outbreak-related hepatitis A deaths are defined at the state level in accordance with each state's respective hepatitis A-related death definition. Some states are reviewing death certificates on a regular basis to actively find hepatitis A-related deaths, while other states are utilizing passive surveillance.
3.Outbreak start date is defined at the state level and may represent the earliest onset date of an outbreak case (AR, AZ, UT), the left censor date for which cases are considered part of the outbreak based on the state outbreak case definition (AL, CA, CO, FL, GA, IL, IN, KY, LA, MA, MI, MO, NC, NH, OH, SC, TN, VA), or when a state declared a hepatitis A outbreak (WV).

[CDC is now supplying a more user-friendly table of ongoing statistics of this enlarging epidemic of hepatitis A in the USA. As can be seen in the table, Kentucky, by far, leads in the total number of cases and deaths, followed by Ohio, West Virginia, Florida, Tennessee, and Indiana.

As the numbers of cases continue to rise in a number of states, and news of smaller (so far) outbreaks occur in others, the question at the end of ProMED post 20190104.6241686 by a Kentucky official, "This is a disease of developing countries. One has to ask: Why are we seeing it in the USA?" is more and more relevant. We are seeing these outbreaks because of the inability to deal with marginalized populations among their midst. The dramatic cutbacks in public health infrastructure in some of these states clearly feed the fire of these outbreaks. They must be addressed by bolstering public health resources and education and directly addressing the needs of these marginalized populations. - Mod.LL
