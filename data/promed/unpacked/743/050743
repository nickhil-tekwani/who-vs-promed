Confirmed: Dead crows had avian flu
----------------------------------
2 crows found dead at a chicken farm in Kyoto Prefecture and a nearby town
were infected with the H5 type virus of highly contagious avian influenza.
The farm ministry provided confirmation Monday.
Ministry officials are investigating the contagion route at the Asada Nosan
Funai Nojo farm in Tanba and the neighboring town of Sonobe.
It is the first time in Japan that wild birds, other than caged poultry,
have been confirmed with avian flu.
"Once a crow contracts the flu, it dies off quickly", said a ministry
official. "Its radius of movement is also limited, limiting the possibility
of spreading the virus over a wide area. It is most imperative to prevent
wild birds from entering poultry farms."
Since crows are not covered by the Domestic Animal Infectious Diseases
Control Law, the discovery will not be counted as a new bird flu outbreak.

The 2 dead crows found at the farm in Kyoto Prefecture where avian
influenza has recently broken out, and in a town nearby, have been
confirmed by the National Institute of Animal Health to be infected with
influenza virus, subtype H5.

The chairman of a poultry company in Japan that failed to report bird flu
on one of its farms has committed suicide with his wife.
The bodies of Hajimu Asada and his wife were found close to one of his
chicken farms near the city of Kyoto.
Mr Asada had been blamed for shipping live birds and eggs even after
chickens had already died from the virus.
4 outbreaks of bird flu have been detected in Japan, which has banned
chicken imports from affected areas. No one in Japan has yet been infected
by the H5N1 avian flu virus.
In their suicide note, Hajimu Asada and his wife Chisako apologised for
having caused a great deal of inconvenience to society.
Until that case, the authorities here had been successful in controlling
previous outbreaks.
Unlike much of South East Asia, Japan's rural areas are lightly populated,
and the local government well-equipped to [decontaminate] and isolate
affected farms. But thousands of live birds had already been shipped from
the Asada farm before the bird flu outbreak there was detected.
The local government has now requested help from the military to try to
prevent the virus from spreading further; of concern is the fact that 2
wild birds have also been found to be infected with the virus in the same area.

Thailand Says It's Free of Bird Flu
------------------------------------
Thailand declared itself free of bird flu Monday and announced that farmers
will resume breeding chickens next month.
No areas of Thailand have had active cases of bird flu in poultry since 25
Feb 2004, more than a month since the country's first case was reported,
said Yukol Limlamthong, director-general of the ministry's Livestock
Department of the Agriculture Ministry.
Yukol said his office had reported its findings to the World Organization
for Animal Health, better known by its French acronym OIE. He said the OIE
allows the breeding of new chicken stocks 3 weeks after no new cases have
been found, but the ministry decided to wait until April to ensure there
are no new outbreaks.
The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization and other experts had warned the
disease might not be purged from the Asian region for at least a year.
Thailand will continue close observation of previously infected areas until
17 Mar 2004 and an OIE official is expected to inspect breeding areas later
this month, Yukol said.
Thailand announced 23 Jan 2004 that bird flu had been discovered in the
country, where the disease has killed 7 people who had close contact with
poultry.
The virus has killed or forced the slaughter of more than 100 million
chickens or other fowl in Asia, where outbreaks have been reported in 10
countries and territories. Other than Thailand, the disease has jumped to
humans only in Vietnam, killing 15 people.

[According to WHO's data on avian influenza in Asia, so far there have been
10 human cases of the disease in Thailand (7 died) and 22 cases in Viet Nam
(15 died). <http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/en/>.
The OIE has published on 8 Mar 2004 an "update on avian influenza in
animals in Asia", covering the situation and causative agents in the
following countries:
H5N1 - Korea, Viet Nam, Japan, Thailand, Cambodia, Hong Kong (SARPRC),
China (PRC) and Indonesia;
H5 - Laos;
H5N2 - Taipei China;
H7 - Pakistan.
<http://www.oie.int/downld/AVIAN%20INFLUENZA/A_AI-Asia.htm>
The update includes Thailand's follow-up report No 6, dated 8 Mar 2004,
signed by Dr. Yukol Limlamthong, Director General, Department of Livestock
Development, Bangkok. According to said follow-up report, during the period
27 Feb - 5 Mar 2004, 5 postmortem investigations have been carried out,
involving 3 suspected cases in quails and 2 in native chicken. All were
found negative by the following tests: Virus Isolation, Hemagglutination,
Hemagglutination Inhibition.
According to OIE's International Animal Health Code, a country can be
declared free of HPAI 6 months after the slaughter of the last affected
animal, provided that country applied a 'stamping out' policy (with or
without vaccination against HPAI). In case no "stamping out" was applied,
the period becomes 3 years. A zone shall be considered as infected with
HPAI until at least 21 days have elapsed after the confirmation of the last
case and the completion of a stamping-out policy and disinfection procedures.
Following the 2003 Highly Pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) epizootic in
the Netherlands, farms could be declared free and restock their poultry
after fulfilling the following EC requirements: on all infected holdings
the manure was safely removed and sentinel birds were placed in the cleaned
and disinfected premises for a period of 3 weeks. The sentinel birds were
tested on all the aforementioned holdings. All tests were negative for
avian influenza. - Mod.AS]
