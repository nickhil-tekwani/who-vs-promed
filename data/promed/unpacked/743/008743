[This statement does not provide sufficient information to suggest an etiology.

Currently, influenza activity in the region remains at low levels, with limited circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2), and influenza B locally. Most influenza-like-illnesses and acute respiratory cases have been associated with respiratory viruses other than influenza viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and rhinovirus. None of these viruses are usually associated with outbreaks of lethal disease. Likewise, the viruses currently associated with outbreaks of severe acute respiratory infection elsewhere, such as the avian influenza viruses H5N1 and H7N9, or the MERS-CoV novel coronavirus, have not been recorded in South America. Nonetheless, all countries are vulnerable to travel-associated introductions of these viruses. Further information and a precise description of the illness reported in Garzon are awaited.

Garzon is a municipality located in the center of the Colombian department of Huila, about 450 km south of Bogota, 114 miles south of the provincial capital, Neiva. - Mod.CP
