Avian influenza A/(H7N2) outbreak in the United Kingdom
-------------------------------------------------------
Several cases of influenza-like-illness (ILI) and/or conjunctivitis
in humans have been linked to an outbreak of avian influenza in
poultry at a smallholding near Corwen in northern Wales, in the
United Kingdom (UK). Three of the cases were hospitalized (1). The
Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) has
identified H7N2, a low pathogenic strain of avian influenza (LPAI),
as the cause of the poultry outbreak (2). Four human cases (2 in
Wales and 2 in northwest England) have confirmed influenza A
infection and are closely linked in time and place to the discovery
of the H7N2 avian influenza virus. Since there are currently very low
levels of seasonal influenza in the UK, it is presumed that they are
infected with influenza H7N2. Antiviral medication was given to 3 of
the cases and all have now recovered. The poultry infections have
been traced back to a public market selling poultry in Chelford,
northwest England, on 7 May [2007].
In accordance with UK policy, it was decided to offer antivirals to
anyone who may have been exposed to the diseased poultry or had close
contact with cases. By 30 May [2007], 20 avian flu contacts had been
identified who have or have had symptoms of an ILI or conjunctivitis.
The National Public Health Service (NPHS) for Wales is using the
following definitions of cases and contacts:
* A case is an individual with influenza-like illness (fever above 38
deg C (100.4 deg F), aches and pains, cough/head cold, sore throat,
or conjunctivitis) who has been in contact with affected premises or
to known infected poultry (handling/within one metre (3.3 ft) or
close contact with another human case;
* A contact is defined as an individual who has been in contact with
affected premises or with known infected poultry (handling/within one
metre) or has had close contact with another person with confirmed or
presumptive avian influenza.
The NPHS of Wales identified 256 people who might have had contact
with the avian flu: in household settings, in a school, and in the
workplace setting, including patients and staff at 2 hospitals. As a
precaution because of contact with a healthcare worker who became
sick with an ILI and is a part of the outbreak, 79 patients and staff
from Ward 6 at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd have been offered antiviral
medication. Another 69 patients and staff from the Accident and
Emergency Unit, Trysfan Ward and Gogarth Ward at Ysbyty Gwynedd are
also being contacted because a patient, who is now discharged, is
being treated for the avian flu virus (3).
As of 29 May [2007], the NPHS had received microbiological test
results from 12 patients in Wales. These were from swabs taken from
the nose and throat and eyes. They were tested for the influenza A
viruses, including the H7 subtype that was isolated from the affected
poultry. One test was positive for the H7 subtype and one for
influenza A (3). Investigations are ongoing in the UK (4) and further
results and updates will become available through the websites of the
relevant authorities -- the Health Protection Agency
(<http://www.hpa.org.uk>), DEFRA (<http://www.defra.gov.uk>), the
Welsh Assembly Government (<http://www.wales.gov.uk>), and the NPHS
for Wales (<http://www.nphs.wales.nhs.uk>).

The number of people showing symptoms of bird flu in Wales rose by 4,
to 17 yesterday [31 May 2007]. And a week after Wales' 1st outbreak
of bird flu was confirmed, it emerged that officials are no closer to
finding the source. Although investigations have centred on a
Cheshire market, officials last night [31 May 2007], said this was
only one line of inquiry they are pursuing.
The 17 people, who are all connected to the outbreak, have been
identified as suffering from flu-like symptoms, and include a
healthcare worker and a schoolgirl. [On 24 May 2007,] Wales's chief
veterinary officer, Dr Christianne Glossop, announced that the H7N2
strain of bird flu had been found on T'n Llwyn farm, in Llanfihangel
Glyn Myfyr, near Corwen, which has also been linked to the market.
Owners Barbara Cowling and Tony Williams bought a 15-strong batch of
22-week-old Rhode Island Red chickens from Chelford Market 3 weeks
ago. But the birds became ill and died.
Almost 100 people, including 79 patients and staff at Ysbyty Glan
Clwyd and pupils at Ysgol Henllan, near Denbigh, have now been given
the antiviral drug Tamiflu, which can lessen the severity and
duration of flu, as a precautionary measure. In total, 256 people who
have been in contact with the infected poultry or people who have
become ill have been traced by public health officials. Assembly
government officials last night [31 May 2007], said it was "too early
to speculate" about the source of the outbreak.
Investigations had centred around the market after Animal Health
officials urged all buyers and suppliers with connections with it to
contact them if any of their animals had become ill. But some within
the North Wales farming community have questioned why the source of
the outbreak has not yet been found, as record of all transactions
are kept by the market itself. One source told the Western Mail,
"Someone must have brought those birds to Chelford for sale. Why have
they not been identified? Why have they not come forward?"
A Welsh Assembly Government spokeswomen last night [31 May 2007]
said, "A full investigation is under way to determine the source of
this outbreak and all tracings and contacts are being investigated.
We have been able to confirm that some of the infected birds were
bought at Chelford Market in Cheshire, on 7 May [2007], and links to
this market are being fully investigated.
"The link to the market is just one of the leads that animal health
is following up as part of its investigations. The investigation is
ongoing and has to be thorough. It is too early to speculate on the
origin and source of the infection."
Meanwhile, health officials confirmed that of the 256 people
identified as being at risk of developing the illness, 79 had already
come out of the incubation period -- which can stretch to as much as
a week. And they said the rise in the number of people with flu-like
symptoms was down to the identification of pre-existing cases
returning from bank holiday breaks rather than any new cases. Dr
Marion Lyons, lead consultant in communicable disease control for the
National Public Health Service for Wales, said, "The new cases have
all reported symptoms starting a few days ago. We are not seeing any
new spread of the flu in the community." She added, "We will remain
vigilant. Most people fall ill within 2 or 3 days of coming into
contact with the virus, but this period can be as long as 7 days. "It
will therefore be next week before we can be certain that the spread
has been stopped.
"As time moves on, we can start to take people off the list of people
we are monitoring. There are 79 people [with] no risk at all of
infection by this avian flu virus. This is very reassuring to them.
It is also very reassuring to us because it demonstrates that the
already low risk of spread is confirmed."
