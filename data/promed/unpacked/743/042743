The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has seen a significant increase in mumps cases related to 2 recent outbreaks.

At least 30 cases have been identified, mainly among attendees of a wedding in Northeast Nebraska Public Health Department's jurisdiction (Cedar, Dixon, Thurston and Wayne counties) and a workplace in Four Corners Health Department's jurisdiction (Butler, Polk, York and Seward counties).

DHHS is working with local health departments to investigate reported cases.

People with mumps are most contagious 3 days before and 5 days after their symptoms begin.

The New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) is investigating 6 mumps cases in Bernalillo County. The cases are in people aged 7-41 years.

"We are encouraging health care providers to be on the lookout for additional mumps cases," said Department of Health Secretary Kathy Kunkel. "If people start experiencing mumps-like symptoms, they should contact their doctor."

There were more than 300 cases of mumps across the East Midlands following an outbreak of the virus at 2 universities earlier this year [2019], it has been confirmed.

Dozens of students fell ill with mumps at Nottingham Trent University and the University of Nottingham.

A total of 40 cases had been confirmed, and 223 cases suspected, by March 2019.

Now Public Health England (PHE) has confirmed 306 cases of mumps across the East Midlands between April and June 2019.

A total of 2028 cases of mumps were confirmed across England during the same 2019 period. That is up from 795 cases confirmed in England during the previous quarter, continuing the increase seen at the start of the year. The region's cases alone account for 15% of the country's total.

Public Health England (PHE) and both universities have urged students to get vaccinated ahead of the new term.

The student, who had the MMR vaccine as a child, returned to her placement when the infection had passed. "I still felt a bit drained, but I was quite lucky the swelling only lasted the maximum period," she said.

PHE said the rise in mumps cases was mostly driven by university students and young people aged between 15 and 34. She said the figures "clearly demonstrate the need for sustained high vaccination rates." However, protection only comes if about 88% of people have been vaccinated, according to viral vaccines expert Prof Jonathan Ball, from the University of Nottingham. If a majority of people are vaccinated, those susceptible to the infection would benefit from "herd immunity," Prof Ball said.

Mumps is a contagious viral infection which causes swelling of the parotid glands. General symptoms can include headache, joint pain, feeling sick, tiredness, loss of appetite and a high temperature. It is spread in the same way as colds and flu, through infected droplets of saliva that can be inhaled or picked up from surfaces and transferred into the mouth or nose.

Mumps can lead to viral meningitis if the virus moves into the outer layer of the brain, although this is rare.

Other complications include swelling of the testicles or ovaries, which may affect a person's fertility.

A person is most contagious a few days before the symptoms develop and for a few days afterwards.

[See the following study on waning mumps immunity over years:

"Lewnard JA and Grad YH. Vaccine waning and mumps re-emergence in the United States. Sci Transl Med. 2018 Mar 21; 10(433): eaao5945. doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.aao5945

Abstract. Following decades of declining mumps incidence amid widespread vaccination, the United States and other developed countries have experienced a resurgence in mumps cases over the last decade. Outbreaks affecting vaccinated individuals and communities with high vaccine coverage have prompted concerns about the effectiveness of the live attenuated vaccine currently in use. It is unclear if immune protection wanes, or if the vaccine protects inadequately against currently circulating mumps virus lineages. Synthesizing data from 6 studies of mumps vaccine effectiveness, we estimated that vaccine-derived immune protection against mumps wanes on average 27 (95% confidence interval: 16 to 51) years post-vaccination. After accounting for this waning, we found no evidence that the emergence of heterologous virus genotypes contributed to changes in vaccine effectiveness over time. A mathematical model of mumps transmission confirmed the central role of waning immunity to the vaccine in the re-emergence of mumps cases. Outbreaks from 2006 to the present among young adults, and outbreaks in the late 1980s and early 1990s among adolescents, aligned with peaks in mumps susceptibility of these age groups predicted to be due to loss of vaccine-derived protection. In contrast, evolution of mumps virus strains escaping immune pressure would be expected to cause a higher proportion of cases among children, not adolescents and young adults as observed. Routine use of a 3rd vaccine dose at age 18 years, or booster dosing throughout adulthood, may be a strategy to prevent mumps re-emergence and should be assessed in clinical trials." - Mod.LK
