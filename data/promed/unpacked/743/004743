Australian Red Cross predicts BSE alerts will limit blood donors
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Red Cross has been warned that State and Federal Health Ministers are
likely to ban people who lived in Britain at the height of the bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) outbreak [in cattle from donating blood.
Federal Chief Medical Officer Richard Smallwood says that he has passed on
to Health Ministers an assessment of the latest evidence from a Scottish
team which found that CJD [sic can be transferred by blood. Professor
Smallwood says a final decision on deferment should be expected within 2 or
3 days. "It's not I think my position to preempt the minister's decision,"
he said. "But I think it may well be that a decision will be made to defer,
given Mr Wooldridge's publicly stated view and given the new evidence from
the Lancet article."

[The Chief Medical Officer's statement is inaccurate. The data published
in Lancet by a joint team based at the Institute of Animal Health's,
Compton Laboratory, and its Neuropathogenesis Unit in Edinburgh, concern
the experimental transmission of the BSE agent by blood transfusion in
sheep. The data are equivocal and the group has been criticized in a
Commentary in the same issue of Lancet for premature release of provisional
data. - Mod.CP
