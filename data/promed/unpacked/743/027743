G'day Jack
Hepatitis G virus (HGV) is endemic worldwide. Isolates from all over the
world have been described, including South America (mainly in abstracts at
meetings). May I draw fellow ProMEDers to three excellent reviews (!), the
latter two describing cases in Australia:
Moaven LD, Locarnini SA. Hepatitis G virus and the GB agents. International
Antiviral News 1995; 3 (10): 164-166
Moaven LD, Bowden DS, Locarnini SA. Hep G virus and the hep GB viruses.
Todays Life Sciences (Australia) 1995; 7(11): 24-28
Bowden DS, Moaven LD, Locarnini SA. New hepatitis viruses: are there enough
letters in the alphabet? Medical Journal of Australia 1996; 164: 87-89
I guess HGV belongs to that very large group of emerging viruses that have
only recently been described because of new techniques to isolate them. I
would speculate that HGV has been around along time - like one of its
closest relatives hepatitis C virus. However, I would argue, that with the
advent of widespread injecting drug use, invasive medical procedures
etcetera HGV (and HCV) are also re-emerging pathogens.
Kind regards

Formal assignment of the name hepatitis G virus (HGV) awaits the decision of
the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). Meanwhile,
the candidate names GBV-C and HGV have been given to viruses described in
Nature Medicine (1995, 1:564-9) and Science (1996, 271:505-8). The sequences
of the genomes of these viruses are in Genbank (accession numbers U36380 and
U44402) and show 95% amino acid identity (85% at the nucleotide level).
Thus, these seem to be isolates (perhaps different genotypes)of the same
virus. See also the commentary by A J Zuckerman in the current issue of the
Lancet (1996, 347:558-9).
