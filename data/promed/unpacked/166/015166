_Melon necrotic spot virus_ newly reported in China
---------------------------------------------------
During April 2007, systemic necrotic spots were observed on melon
(_Cucumis melo_) grown in plastic greenhouses in Haimen city of
Jiangsu Province, China. By mid May [2007] disease rates in different
plastic houses ranged from 19 to 100 percent with symptoms
characteristic of _Melon necrotic spot virus_ (MNSV). These symptoms
included many necrotic spots on the young leaves (Fig. 1a) followed
by coalescence of spots to form larger irregular lesions on older
leaves (Fig. 1b). Necrotic stripes appeared on stems, and the
infected leaves also became curled and wilted.

Sap extracts from diseased plants were mechanically inoculated to
melon, watermelon (_Citrullus lanatus_), and cucumber (_Cucumis
sativus_). Melon, watermelon, and cucumber all showed local necrotic
spots on cotyledons 3 to 5 days post inoculation in the greenhouse,
and 6 days post inoculation under 20 deg C (68 deg F) in a growth
chamber. Systemic necrotic spots were observed only on melon plants
and began to appear 6 to 7 days post inoculation in the greenhouse
and 9-14 days post inoculation at 20 deg C (68 deg F) in a growth
chamber (Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b).

For further confirmation of the causal agent, polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) was used to amplify a 710 basepair region of the MNSV
coat protein gene. The expected PCR product was obtained from virus
infected fresh leaves, but not from healthy plants. The alignment of
a 673 basepair region of the amplified nucleotide sequence showed 93
and 92 percent identity to MNSV isolates from Spain and the
Netherlands, respectively.

MNSV has been previously reported in Japan, the Netherlands, USA, UK,
Greece, Korea, Spain, and other countries. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the 1st report of MNSV in China.

[Melon necrotic spot virus (MNSV; genus _Carmovirus_, family
_Tombusvirus_) was first reported in Japan in 1959. It has since
spread widely resulting in worldwide economic losses in production of
melons and other cucurbits. Recently, serious outbreaks of disease
associated with new strains of MNSV have occurred at various sites in
Japan where the virus is reported to be an especially serious threat
to glasshouse crops. Symptoms may vary at different growth stages of
host plants and include chlorotic or necrotic spots on leaves,
necrotic streaks in stems, and occasionally plant death. The virus
also causes sponge-like symptoms and crevices in melon fruits that
greatly decrease their commercial value. External appearance of
affected fruits remains normal so that it is impossible to recognise
and remove them prior to sale.

MNSV is transmitted through the soil by the fungal vector _Olpidium
bornovanus_ (and/or _O. radicale_, the taxonomy of these species is
apparently still under dispute) via zoospores. Fungal resting spores
can survive in the soil for years. The virus (directly or via its
vector fungus) can also be spread by seed (for example at a rate of
10-40 percent in melon), plant-to-plant contact, and mechanical
means. Since the virus may be both seed-borne and soil-borne, it may
be readily distributed through the cucurbit seed market to become
endemic in a district, where it can then spread locally and persists
for a long period in association with its soil-borne fungal vector.
Soil fumigation by methyl bromide was used previously to sanitise the
soil between cultivations. The use of this chemical is now prohibited
in many countries for environmental reasons. Disease management
therefore relies on use of certified virus-free seed and
phytosanitary cultural practices. Melon germplasm with a single
recessive resistance gene preventing the accumulation of viral RNAs
has been identified and is used in developing cucurbit varieties
resistant to MNSV.

_O. bornovanus_ is also the vector for other cucurbit viruses in the
same family of _Tombusvirus_, for example _Cucumber leaf spot virus_
and _Cucumber necrosis virus_. A number of viruses of different crops
are spread by the related fungus _O. brassicae_.
