With respect to Daniel Shapiro, M.D.'s question: "Does anyone know of other
publications with evidence of infection by an exotic pathogen following
xenotransplantation? "
Yes indeed. Thomas Starzl, who transplanted baboon livers into humans in
1992 and 1993 wrote about the transmission of Simian Foamy Virus and other
baboon viruses to human xenograft patients in a paper which was titled,
"Baboon-to-Human Liver Transplantation," Lancet, Vol. 341 (January 1993):
65-71.
In 1992 and 1993 two patients who received whole baboon livers were found
to have baboon white blood cells in every tissue of their bodies, including
the heart, lung, kidneys, and lymph nodes. The grafted organs began
producing baboon products, such as baboon blood-clotting factors, baboon
transferrin, etc.. Starzl called this process "baboonization" and claimed
that chimerism in xenograft recipients is essential if xenografts are to
succeed. (Both of Starzl's xenograft recipients died after suffering
terrible side-effects). Dr. Jonathan Allan has also written extensively
about baboon viruses being transmitted to humans. See for example his piece
in Molecular Diagnosis (1995).
It should also be emphasized that most xenotransplantation research has, so
far, focused on overcoming humans' hyperacute rejection of animal organs.
But very little attention has been paid to the question of whether animal
organs are functionally able to sustain human life - anatomically,
biochemically, physiologically, metabolically, and pharmacologically. For
an excellent analysis of this topic, see "Animal Organs in Humans:
Uncalculated Risks and Unanswered Questions" by Dr. Gill Langley and Joyce
D'Silva, published by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection in
London (October 1998). Don't let the source throw you off. This is an
excellent report and fully referenced.
With respect to Peter Cyrog, DVM's question about whether pigs can be
raised to be "germ-free":
The moderator of this list offered Marie Cornu's response of (02) of this
thread: "Only gnotobiotic (or axenic) pigs, which would have grown in
perfectly sterile conditions, could be candidates for xenotransplantation.
So, the risk of pathogens inhabiting pig's tissue would be therefore very
limited, as long as it concerns microorganisms."
In a previous post, I had written that, in a 1996 report on
xenotransplantation, the U.S. Institute of Medicine acknowledged that "it
is not possible to have completely pathogen-free animals, even those
derived from Cesarean section, because some potentially infectious agents
are passed in the genome and others may be passed transplacentally."
British virologists have said that it would be a "daunting task" to
eliminate infectious retroviruses from pigs to be used for
xenotransplantation, given that porcine endogenous retroviruses are
scattered throughout the pig genome. In addition, disease states vary from
day to day. Just because a pig is raised in a "sterile" environment, does
not mean it is healthy. Most daunting are the unknown viruses that we may
not be able to detect.

[It would be interesting to see what the Risk analysts have to say on this
last point, as well as on the subject in general. Are there any RA numbers?
