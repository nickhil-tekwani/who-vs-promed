The report suggests either that experimental work was carried out in
poultry or that there were birds in close proximity to where the disease
agent was manipulated. I think this example illustrates 2 important points
related to experimentation with a zoonotic agent of trade importance.
One is that if the agent has been allowed to escape from an experimental
site, then it has posed a public health risk to animal handlers and others
in contact with the animals. This critical risk has apparently not been
managed adequately in the design and implementation of the experiments
conducted. To my knowledge no provincial university in Thailand has
facilities at the P3 biocontainment level suitable for conducting
experimental work with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus.
Secondly, the possible escape of an agent of trade significance from an
experimental situation is regarded very seriously in most countries, such
that access to these agents is restricted to facilities designed to contain
them.
The Australian Animal Health Laboratory is a case in point -- built and
maintained at considerable expense to enable safe diagnosis and research on
trade-significant disease agents exotic to Australia. While this may not
be an epidemic, it is nonetheless an outbreak that has potential to further
delay regaining disease-free status.

[Dr Gleeson, an internationally renowned avian influenza expert, raises
valid concerns. One might wonder whether the blurred picture available at
present might also be the outcome of political interference in Thailand.
Providing scientific, first-hand data on the alleged
avian-influenza-related research allegedly performed on Chiang Mai
University's campus may be useful in clarifying the issue. - Mod.AS]
