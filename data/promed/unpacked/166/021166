Gonorrhea is on the rise in New Hampshire, with a 67 percent increase of cases in 2016 compared to 2015. So far, 206 cases have been reported between 1 Jan 2016 and 31 Jul 2016, according to a medical alert sent by the Division of Public Health Services Bureau of Infection Disease Control.

Those who have been the most impacted by the sexually transmitted disease have been men under 40 years old and living in Hillsborough County. Merrimack, Rockingham, and Strafford counties have also had a rise in reported cases.

The CDC recommends that gonorrhea gets treated with a shot of ceftriaxone and azithromycin taken orally. The dual therapy has remained effective even though the Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project studies show that gonorrhea is becoming more resistant to the antimicrobial azithromycin.

"For all of your patients, take a thorough sexual history to determine patient risk and need for STD screening," the department said.
