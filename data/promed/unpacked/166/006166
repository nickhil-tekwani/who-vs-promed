The Government set up an Inter-ministerial Committee on 28 April 1999
to handle virus diseases originating from animals such as the Hendra,
Nipah and Japanese encephalitis [JE, rabies and other ailments, the
Dewan Negara [Malaysian Parliament was told today.
Health Minister Datuk Chua Jui Meng said the committee would advise on
preventive and control measures among other things and coordinate the
efforts of the various ministries and set up a zoonotic diseases unit.
He said under phase two of the operation to eradicate such diseases, the
Veterinary Services Department was collecting blood samples from pigs
outside of the disease affected areas and the operation was expected to last
three months. Local and foreign experts were also collecting blood samples
from dogs, cats, wild boars, cows, buffaloes, bats, goats, horses, rats and
birds to establish whether they were carrying the deadly viruses.
"So far dogs and cats in the affected areas have tested positive [for Nipah
virus and two horses in Ipoh also had the deadly virus," Chua said. He said
the destruction of 901 934 pigs over 35 days had reduced cases of viral
diseases [meaning encephalitis.
He said studies conducted on people affected by viral diseases [meaning
encephalitis in Negri Sembilan and Perak showed 139 were affected by the
Nipah virus, 20 by the JE [virus, 28 people had both viruses and results were
being awaited on 71 other cases.
"Of those who had died of viral diseases [?encephalitis, eight were
confirmed to have had the JE virus, 26 had been infected by both, 49 were
infected by the Nipah virus and the results on 26 others were being awaited.

[We are still in the dark as to how the various aetiologies of the fatal
human cases were established -- by virus isolation, demonstration of viral
nucleic acid by PCR, or antibody test? I do not expect Members of
Parliament would be interested in this information, but I hope the
responsible laboratory could enlighten us on this. -- Mod. CYC
