Abstract
--------
We assessed 4 lizard species in Chile for _Trypanosoma cruzi_, the causative agent of Chagas disease, and one species for its ability to transmit the protozoan to uninfected kissing bugs. All lizard species were infected, and the tested species was capable of transmitting the protozoan, highlighting their role as _T. cruzi_ reservoirs.

[The causative agent of Chagas disease, _Trypanosoma cruzi_ is a zoonotic protozoan maintained in the Americas by wild and domestic mammals and transmitted by kissing bugs. Many mammalian species are competent hosts for _T. cruzi_ and play a relevant role in its dynamics. Little is known about the role of nonmammalian vertebrates.

The researchers obtained samples from 4 species of lizards, _Microlophus atacamensis_, _Liolaemus platei_, _L. fuscus_and _Garthia gaudichaudii_, and detected _T. cruzi_ in all of them. Further, they experimentally demonstrated that infected _L. platei_ infected nearly all triatomine nymphs that fed on them.

Further studies should pursue shedding light on the role that lizards may have in the sylvatic cycle of Chagas disease. - Mod.PMB
