India: Avian Influenza Situation
--------------------------------
On 18 Feb 2006, agricultural authorities in India confirmed the
country's 1st outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in
poultry. The disease was detected at several commercial farms in the
Navapur sub-district in the western state of Maharashtra. Prior to
that date, large numbers of poultry deaths, at more than 50 farms in
the area, had been noted, but the cause was initially diagnosed as
Newcastle disease. The outbreak is now thought to have begun on 27
Jan 2006. Agricultural authorities have reported that some backyard
farms are also affected. Mass culling of birds at affected farms
continued today [21 Feb 2006].
The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has dispatched rapid
response teams to Navapur and neighboring areas. House-to-house
searches for cases of influenza-like illness are being conducted. The
government has equipped a Navapur hospital for the management, in
isolation, of possible human cases. WHO was informed today [21 Feb
2006] that 12 patients with fever and respiratory illness in Navapur
sub-district have been hospitalized for observation as a
precautionary measure. An additional 3 patients have been
hospitalized, also for observation, in the Vaira sub-district of the
adjacent Gujarat state.
Samples from these patients and their close contacts are being tested
at the country's National Institute of Virology. Results are expected
later this week [4th week Feb 2006].

2 Suspected Cases of Avian Influenza in Navapur
-----------------------------------------------
Initial reports have confirmed avian influenza in 2 people among
those who were under observation in [the city of] Navapur in [the
province of] Maharashtra. Health officials have said that samples of
some of those quarantined tested positive for bird flu. However,
these are mild infections.
Earlier in the day, the government had ordered 2 new sophisticated
testing procedures [real time RT-PCR?] to tackle the bird flu
outbreak. The new tests will shorten the time taken to detect the
virus in both human beings and birds. While previous tests took days
to confirm the presence of H5N1 virus, the new testing procedures
will produce results in a few hours.
Blood test results of 94 poultry farm workers who came in contact
with infected poultry are also being sent to the Union Health
Ministry. Health authorities say they visited 42 000 houses in a
surveillance operation to prevent the spread of bird flu to humans.
At least 12 people showing flu symptoms are under observation in
Navapur.
The World Health Organization has supplied about 200 bottles of the
anti-flu drug Tamiflu in syrup form. The government is also inviting
bids from Cipla, Hetero and Ranbaxy for supply of anti-viral drugs.

India Confirms Bird Flu in Humans
---------------------------------
Tests have confirmed the presence of the deadly H5N1 strain of avian
influenza virus in 2 blood samples taken from humans in India's
Maharashtra state, NDTV television network reported on Wednesday [22
Feb 2006].
Samples from 12 people suffering from mild respiratory disorders in
Nandurabr district in Maharashtra had been sent for testing, along
with samples from 90 people who had come into direct contact with
chickens in the infected zone. The 1st cases of H5N1 in chickens were
reported from poultry farms in Nandurbar, about 450 km north of the
Maharashtrian capital Mumbai, on Saturday [18 Feb 2006].
Initial test results indicated that 2 people were suffering from a
"mild version" of bird flu, that is, they were not showing all
typical symptoms of the full-blown version of the disease, NDTV
reported, citing sources in India's Health Ministry. The news channel
said an official announcement would be made later Wednesday [22 Feb
2006] or on Thursday morning. The tests are being conducted at the
National Institute of Virology in the Maharashtrian town of Pune and
the National Institute of Communicable Diseases in New Delhi. "The
possibility of the virus traveling to humans [transmitting from
person-to-person?] is a distinct possibility and cannot be ruled
out," Federal Health Secretary PK Hota said. He said the situation
should be taken seriously.
There have been no deaths from the virus yet in India. The 12 people
under observation at the district hospital in Navapur, the main town
in Nandurbar, are being kept in isolation, a Health Ministry release
said. The patients showed mild upper respiratory tract infection, and
their chest X-rays were normal, the release added.
Health authorities were continuing their house-to-house surveillance
in the infected zone to identify suspected cases among those exposed
to the infected poultry. The health of workers and officials involved
in the culling of chickens in the infected zone was also being
monitored, the Health Ministry said.
The federal Health Ministry said it had 50 000 courses of the
anti-flu drug Tamiflu in stock. Another 20 000 courses had been
ordered and were expected by Thursday [23 Feb 2006].

[4] Malaysia - suspected cases test negative

Malaysia: 5 suspected Patients Test Negative
--------------------------------------------
Bird flu tests showed negative for 5 of the 7 people Malaysia
admitted to hospital on Wednesday [15 or 22 Feb 2006?] with breathing
problems, following its 1st poultry infection in over a year, the
Bernama News Agency reported. Health Minister Chua Soi Lek said tests
on 5 of the group exposed to sick chickens had turned out negative
for the deadly H5N1 virus, the state-run agency reported. Authorities
are still waiting for test results on the remaining 2, both children.
No human cases have so far been reported in Malaysia, which last
reported the H5N1 virus in a chicken in the northern state of
Kelantan in 2004.
Earlier, Chua said 2 adults and 5 children staying within 300 meters
(1000 feet) of the outbreak site were in hospital. "I will not say
that they were suspected," Chua told a news conference when asked
whether the 7 might have bird flu. "I would say that we are admitting
them for investigation to be on the safe side, because if they later
came out to be [confirmed cases] and they have been moving around
town, then it's not safe." Chua said the case was a "very isolated"
incident.
Chua has said the authorities had screened 916 people from 161 homes,
but only 7 people with respiratory tract infections had been admitted
to hospital.

[5] Nigeria - no human cases detected

Nigeria: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update
-----------------------------------------------
No human cases have been detected to date.

To date, 4 patients with respiratory symptoms and a history of
exposure to diseased poultry have been investigated for possible
infection. This number includes a woman who died of an acute
respiratory illness on 16 Feb 2006. The 3 remaining patients are all
in good condition. Arrangements are being made to send samples from
all 4 patients for testing at a WHO collaborating laboratory in the
United Kingdom.
The initial outbreak in Kaduna state is now known to have begun on 10
Jan 2006, raising the possibility that earlier human exposures and
cases may have occurred in that area and elsewhere. At hospitals in
Kaduna, Kano, and Katsina, near affected farms, staff from the
WHO-led teams have now examined hundreds of patient records,
searching for possible cases that may have occurred earlier. No such
cases have been identified to date.
The scale of the outbreak in birds is not yet fully understood. Most
investigations have followed poultry deaths on large commercial
farms, where outbreaks are highly visible. Little is known about the
presence of the virus in small backyard flocks, where the greatest
risk of human exposures and infections resides.
Rapid spread of the virus within Nigeria has raised concern over possible
spread to neighboring countries. Borders are porous, and restrictions
on the movement of people and poultry are difficult to enforce. WHO
staff at offices in these countries are monitoring the situation
closely in collaboration with government officials. Rumors of
possible human cases in neighboring countries are also being closely
monitored.
