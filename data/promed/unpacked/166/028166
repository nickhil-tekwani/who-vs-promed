Anglers are attracted to the Wasatch Plateau in central Utah because there
are so many waters. If fishing is slow at one spot they hit the road for a
few minutes and try another. That's great for anglers, but state wildlife
officials fear that accessibility will help whirling disease spread rapidly
across fisheries on the Manti-La Sal National Forest.
Division of Wildlife Resources (DWR) officials announced on Wednesday that
the trout malady that deforms and sometimes kills young trout was confirmed
in Electric Lake. Whirling disease was discovered in May in Huntington
Creek, which flows from the dam at Electric Lake, and fisheries biologists
had hoped the cement barrier would help prevent the spread of whirling to
the reservoir.
"We've had biologists watch people fishing in Huntington Creek and then
head to one of the reservoirs and walk right in with the same waders they
used in the creek," said Paul Birdsey, regional aquatics director for the
DWR. "If you want to move whirling disease around that's the way to do it."
Electric Lake was once used as a brood stock natural fishery for
Yellowstone cutthroat trout. The state has since changed its cutthroat
focus to native strains like Colorado River and Bonneville cutthroat, but
Electric Lake is still largely supported by natural reproduction.
Hybrid tiger trout have also been recently introduced. Electric Lake is
also a popular place for anglers to trap red-sided shiners to use for bait
and Birdsey is worried mud from those traps and other gear used at Electric
Lake will lead to other fisheries being exposed to whirling disease.
"Anglers need to be that much more careful," he said.
There is no evidence of human health issues in eating trout infected with
whirling disease. Wildlife officials have scheduled nearby reservoirs --
Huntington (also known as Mammoth), Cleveland, Boulger, and Benches -- to
be tested for whirling disease. The results will likely be released at this
time next year.
