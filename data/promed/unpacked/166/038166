Today, the US Food and Drug Administration announced that it has found
_Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 (a bacterium that can cause serious foodborne
illness) in a sample of prepackaged Nestle Toll House refrigerated cookie
dough currently under recall by the manufacturer and marketer, Nestle USA.
The contaminated sample was collected at Nestle's facility in Danville,
Virginia on 25 Jun 2009.

On 19 Jun 2009 the FDA and the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) warned consumers not to eat any varieties of prepackaged
Nestle Toll House refrigerated cookie dough due to the risk of
contamination with _E. coli_ O157:H7. The warning was based on an
epidemiological study conducted by CDC and several state and local health
departments. As of [Thu 25 Jun 2009] CDC reports that 69 persons from 29
states have been infected with the outbreak strain. 34 persons have been
hospitalized, 9 with a severe complication called hemolytic uremic
syndrome. No one has died.

Further laboratory testing is needed to conclusively link the _E. coli_
strain found in the product to the same strain that is causing the outbreak.

Nestle USA has fully cooperated with the FDA and CDC investigation and has
recalled all of its prepackaged Nestle Toll House refrigerated cookie dough
products.
