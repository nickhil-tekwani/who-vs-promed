A 6-year-old boy from southwestern Kampot province was confirmed to have contracted avian influenza H5N1, bringing the number of cases to 10; the death toll remained at 8 in 2013, a health expert said Wednesday [3 Apr 2013]. "The boy was admitted to the Kantha Bopha Hospital in Phnom Penh on 31 Mar 2013 for severe pneumonia, and he tested positive for H5N1 at the Instituts Pasteur on Tuesday [2 Apr 2013]," Dr. Denis Laurent, deputy director of the hospital, told Xinhua. "The boy is still alive but in severe condition."

This year [2013], the country has seen the worst outbreak of the virus since the disease was 1st identified in 2004. To date, the country has recorded 31 human cases of the virus, with 27 deaths.

Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen repeatedly appealed to television and radio stations to broadly inform people about the outbreaks of avian influenza H5N1 virus, which has killed 8 people so far this year [2013].

"I'd like to appeal to television and radio stations to jointly broadcast educational spots about bird flu prevention as much as possible in order to reach people in remote areas," he said late last month [March 2013] at a graduation ceremony in Phnom Penh. "Television and radio hosts should also spread their educational messages to inform people about the virus. Health officials alone cannot prevent the virus from spreading, but participation from everyone is very important to prevent and eliminate it," he said.

The noticeable signs of bird flu include fever with temperature higher than 38 C (over 100.4 F), and difficulty in breathing. Before having fever, the patient will have touched or eaten poultry.

[It is unusual that almost all (27) of the 31 confirmed human cases of avian influenza A/(H5N1) virus infection in Cambodia have had a fatal outcome, whereas globally, only 371 of the 623 confirmed cases have died. The H5N1 avian influenza virus has affected humans in 15 different countries, whereas the H7N9 avian influenza so far has been confined to China.
