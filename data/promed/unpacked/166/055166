The 1st Brazilian to be cured from rabies was discharged from a
hospital in Recife, in northeastern Pernambuco state, on Friday [18
Sep 2009]. Bitten by a bat while sleeping, the patient, a 16-year-old
boy, caught rabies in September 2008. He spent more than 100 days in
the intensive care unit since being hospitalized in October [2008].

According to the Oswaldo Cruz Hospital, because of the disease the
patient had difficulty in walking and speaking. He will continue
receiving treatment for this and hip surgery in 3 weeks.

The boy underwent experimental treatment, the so-called Milwaukee
protocol, which was developed in the United States [based on the
earlier Wisconsin protocol] in 2004. The treatment involves putting
the patient in a chemically-induced coma and using anti-viral
medicine, sedatives and anesthetics. So far, the Milwaukee protocol
has been used on [16] patients worldwide -- Silva was among the only 3
successful cases. The other 2 are U.S. girls aged 16 and 10.

Rabies is a highly deadly disease. One contracts rabies by being
bitten by animals such as dogs, cats, bats, foxes or cattle. The
disease affects the nervous system, causing symptoms like paralysis,
anxiety and hallucinations.

as well as the discussion it engendered concerning the efficacy of the
Wisconsin protocol -- on which the Milwaukee protocol is based -- in
survival of rabies patients, can be found in the ProMED archives
