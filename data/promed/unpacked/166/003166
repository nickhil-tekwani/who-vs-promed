Because _Vibrio cholerae_ is capable of surviving the very inhospitable
conditions of ballast water the probability is high that _V. vulnificus_
can also survive and be transported to international ports by commercial
vessels. However, far more testing of ballast water is essential to
determine the numbers and species of foreign pathogens that are being
distributed by this means.
