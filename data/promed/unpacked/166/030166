The Ministry of Health today [26 Aug 2014] confirmed the 2nd death due to [a] hantavirus [infection] so far this year. According to official data, the case is a male school teacher in Parque Lefevre [Panama province, Panama]. However, it was stated that the educator contracted the disease in Los Santos [province], where he was accustomed to pass the weekends.

The Ministry of Education carried out a cleanup day this past 6 Jul [2014], thinking in the beginning that the death had been due to dengue.

[Los Santos province is the locality where most cases of hantavirus infection, with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), occur in Panama. This case makes the 46th in the province so far this year (2014). Although the hantavirus involved in this case is not specified, the one most likely responsible for these cases of HPS is Choclo virus, which is endemic in Los Santos Province. As mentioned in ProMED-mail archive no. 20130204.1527935, of the 3 hantaviruses known to occur in Panama, only Choclo is a known human pathogen, causing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, and can have a high case fatality rate, especially when victims come to the hospital late in the course of their disease. No specific ecological details are provided concerning the environment where these 2 patients may have acquired their infections, but the mention of extensive agricultural crops as a contributory factor in the appearance of cases is due to the relationship of these crops to the presence of rodent hosts of Choclo virus.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg.
