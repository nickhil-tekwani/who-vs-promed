A public health emergency has been declared in Marshall Islands. This
has happened following an outbreak of drug-resistant tuberculosis
(TB). The government is thinking of calling upon special powers of quarantine.

In less than 2 months the number of people with the drug-resistant
disease has risen from 6 to 10 in the western Pacific nation.
Everyone now fears that the situation would escalate and will reach
to 500. Majuro Hospital chief of staff Marie Lanwi-Paul, said, "We
are in the process of doubling the bed capacity" in the TB isolation unit."

Rachel Powel who is working with the World Health Organisation said,
"Drug resistance poses a serious threat to our ability to treat and
control TB." Marshall Islands Health Minister Amenta Matthew said she
was in the process of forming legislation that would give power to
the director of health to quarantine people who were not complying
with TB prevention requirements. Matthew felt that the drug-resistant
TB evolved because of people not following advice of taking medicines
despite physicians counseling them. It was reported that one patient
was taken to the court by health authorities for failing to take
treatment and remain in isolation.

[It is stated in the news release that the outbreak of drug resistant
TB in the Marshall Islands is secondary to improper management of the
TB cases, i.e., the TB drugs were not taken by patients as
recommended by the physicians. However, the exact drugs to which the
_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ isolates are resistant and the extent of
the drug resistance is not specified in the above news release. Also
it is not specified if there is any epidemiological linkage among the
patients, if the isolates have similar drug resistance patterns, or
if they have been genotyped. Detailed discussions of drug-resistant
TB can be found in prior ProMED posts below.

The Marshall Islands is an island nation with a population of about
62 000 in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, just west of the
International Date Line and just north of the Equator
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_nation>). From 1946 to 1958,
the USA tested 67 nuclear weapons in the Marshall Islands.
Independence was completed in 1990, when the UN officially ended its
Trusteeship status. In 1986, the Compact of Free Association with the
USA provides for aid and USA defense of the islands in exchange for
continued USA military use of a missile testing range
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_nation>). The location of the
Marshall Islands in relation to other countries in the South Pacific
can be found on a map at
