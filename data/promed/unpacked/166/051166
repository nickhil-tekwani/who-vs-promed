Dogs spreading sheep measles in Marlborough
------------------------------------------------------
Awatere Valley sheep farmer Hayley Pitt says public awareness of sheep measles will help stop the disease spreading.

Marlborough residents exercising their dogs near vineyards where sheep are grazing are increasing the chance of sheep measles spreading in the region, an animal welfare group says.

Awatere Valley sheep farmer Jeremy Pitt lost 160 lambs, or 3 per cent, to sheep measles [so far] this year [2105]. The lambs were among 5500 grazing on a vineyard near Renwick over the winter.

Pitt said he had grazed lambs in the area for the past 10 years and this was the worst season for infected stock. The vineyard was bordered by a public road and river stopbanks [a river embankment built to prevent flooding], both popular with people walking their dogs, he said.

"The problem is not going away, it's an annual issue and it is getting worse. I'm not anti-dogs, or against someone wanting to take their dog for a walk or a run. But people need to be aware that if they don't have their dogs regularly dosed, sheep measles will continue to be a problem for farmers."

Pitt said sheep measles were absent from his Mount Gladstone property, in the Awatere Valley, because he dosed his farm dogs every month.

Sheep measles are spread when tapeworm eggs from dried dog faeces are blown onto pasture and eaten by sheep. Cysts in the meat contaminate the carcass of the animal, leaving it unsuitable for sale.

Ovis Management is a non-profit organisation, funded by the Meat Industry Association, fighting to control the disease.

Ovis Management project manager Dan Lynch said a number of Marlborough sheep farmers who grazed sheep on vineyards during the winter had stock infected with sheep measles. Ovis recorded 31 Marlborough farmers with infected stock in 2013, Lynch said.

Pet owners needed to be aware of the importance of dosing their dogs for tapeworm to control the disease, he said.

There was potential risk the infected meat could be exported by mistake, he said.

Marlborough was among the worst affected regions for sheep measles because of its high number of vineyards used for grazing sheep. The grassed areas around vineyards are accessible to people wanting to exercise dogs, he said. Anyone who exercised their dogs near sheep, or brought their dog onto a farm, needed to make sure their dog was dosed, Lynch said.

People should not feed their dogs fresh meat, he said. The meat should be frozen for at least 10 days and thawed, or cooked, he said.

[Sheep measles is the common name given to lesions in sheep and goats caused by an "intermediate stage" of a tapeworm parasite. This parasite stage is also known as _Cysticercus ovis_. The "primary stage" of the parasite is a tapeworm (_Taenia ovis_), which infects the intestine of dogs.

The tapeworm stage (_Taenia ovis_) occurs in the small intestine of the dog, with the tapeworm itself being up to 2 metres long. The adults produce eggs that pass out in tapeworm segments in the dog's faeces. If these are on pasture, they can be eaten by sheep, in which larvae develop and migrate to the heart and diaphragm and some other muscles.

In the muscles they form cysts up to 10 mm long. Over time, the cysts calcify, becoming hard. The cycle continues when dogs eat sheep carcasses that contain viable cysts that develop into tapeworms in the dog's small intestine.

No treatment for cysts in sheep is available; control is based on breaking the life cycle. Specifically, this means preventing dogs from eating sheep carcasses, meat or organs. Freezing or cooking of meat and viscera may not reliably kill all cysts.

Dogs in sheep areas should continue to be regularly treated for tapeworm. Recent research by Dr David Jenkins, Charles Sturt University, has shown that control of worms in farm dogs and widespread use of dry dog food has largely removed dogs as a definitive host. Foxes, however, have been shown to be active in maintaining the population of sheep measles.

This parasite has 2 names because the cyst stage was described and named before it was known to be a stage of the life cycle of _Taenia ovis_.

Other tapeworms in dogs: _Taenia pisiformis_, _T. serialis_ and _Dipylidium caninum_ are common tapeworms of dogs, foxes and dingoes and should be differentiated from _T. ovis_ and _T. hydatigena_ (bladder worm). The intermediate hosts of _T. pisiformis_ and _T. serialis_ are the rabbit and hare. The flea and possibly the biting louse are the intermediate hosts for _D. caninum_.

The hydatid tapeworm, _Echinococcus granulosus_, also occurs in dogs, with the intermediate stage affecting sheep and sometimes humans.
