Cases of cholera may have declined in Yemen, but the ongoing war and blockade are now creating a new threat to public health, as a suspected diphtheria outbreak takes hold.

By [4 Dec 2017], 318 suspected cases of diphtheria and 28 deaths had been reported in 15 of Yemen's 20 governorates. Half the suspected cases are children between the ages of 5 and 14, and nearly 95 percent of deaths are children under 15. Nearly 70 percent of all suspected cases are in Ibb governorate.

Diphtheria is a contagious and potentially fatal bacterial infection characterized mainly by a thick grey membrane at the back of the throat or nose, sore throat, and fever. It can be prevented through vaccination.

Marc Poncin, MSF's emergency coordinator in Ibb, said: "Globally, diphtheria has been eradicated from most countries after systematic childhood vaccination campaigns, and it's become something of a neglected and forgotten disease. Even in Yemen, the last diphtheria case was recorded in 1992, and the last outbreak in 1982. The ongoing war and blockade are sending the Yemen health system decades back in time."

Poncin adds: "After 2.5 years of violence and a blockade on supplies including medicines and vaccines, the healthcare infrastructure is in tatters. The blockade on fuel has meant that patients cannot afford to travel to the very few health centers still operating across the country. This is crucial, because if people infected are unable to access treatment regularly, diphtheria can spread in the body and be fatal in up to 40 percent of the cases."

Humanitarian actors are also struggling to start diphtheria treatment and prevention activities due to the ongoing logistical difficulties bringing specialized staff and needed supplies into Yemen and to areas where they're most needed.
"This is undeniably another human-made disease inflicted on a country that has barely recovered from a massive cholera outbreak -- which is not even over yet," says Poncin.

"Globally, the decline of diphtheria in recent years was accompanied by a concrete loss of knowledge regarding its treatment. This is making it much more difficult for health workers to quickly and correctly identify, isolate, and treat cases," adds Poncin. "To treat diphtheria, patients need to be isolated and receive antibiotics and anti-toxins. But the global supply of the anti-toxin, which is the single most important aspect of treatment, is very limited, and no anti-toxins were available in Yemen prior to a few weeks ago."

To tackle the outbreak, MSF, together with WHO, is acquiring most of the antitoxin that is still available worldwide, and ordering more antibiotics. MSF has also put together a rapid response team to survey and identify suspected cases in communities, and provide prophylaxis to those in contact with a diphtheria patient.

On [11 Dec 2017, MSF opened a Diphtheria Treatment Unit in Nasser Hospital in Ibb city, and is in the process of supporting 2 others in Yarim and Jiblah hospitals -- the later with Intensive Care Unit capacities. An ambulance referral system will also be set up to transport suspected cases to hospital. MSF will additionally, support transport of samples to a laboratory to better confirm cases, and carry out health promotion activities to alert communities to diphtheria. Meanwhile MSF is also setting up an intensive care unit in Sadaqa hospital, Aden, where 14 cases were recorded, resulting in 4 deaths.

"We have been visiting houses where 6 or more displaced people are living in very cramped conditions. In such settings there are no ways to properly isolate cases, and it creates the perfect conditions for diphtheria to spread. Isolating and treating patients, offering preventative care for affected communities and raising public awareness are therefore crucial to halt the spread of diphtheria," says Poncin. "Yemen's healthcare system cannot afford another outbreak."

[Diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable disease. Diphtheria toxoid vaccine is not manufactured as a monovalent vaccine; it is available combined with tetanus toxoid, both in full-strength doses (denoted by upper case letters "DT") in pediatric formulations and in reduced-strength dose combined with full-strength dose of tetanus toxoid (denoted by upper case T and lower case d, "Td") in adult formulations. These are combined with acellular or whole-cell pertussis antigens in full strength in pediatric formulations (DTaP, DTwP) or in reduced strength in the adolescent/adult-formulations (Tdap).

In the United States, a total of 5 DTaP doses are recommended to be given to children, one dose each at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, with booster doses at ages 15-18 months, and 4-6 years (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/child/0-18yrs-child-combined-schedule.pdf). The fully immunized person who is exposed can become a carrier of the bacterium but may only develop a mild case, or may not get sick at all. But if not fully vaccinated, the risk of getting severely ill is 30 times higher (http://www.vaccinews.net/diseases_vaccines.php).

Many of the complications of diphtheria, such as myocarditis and polyneuropathy, are due to toxin production. Respiratory difficulties can result from paralysis of the diaphragm and obstruction of the airways due the membrane that forms on the pharynx, tonsils, and soft palate that may extend to the larynx and trachea. Without treatment, as many as 1 out of 2 patients can die from the disease. Survival requires access to antibiotics, anti-toxin, and intensive medical care, which may not be available in war-torn regions. - Mod.ML
