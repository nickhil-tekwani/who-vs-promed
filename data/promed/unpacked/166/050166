[This reports that _Mesocyclops_ species (crustanceans) are being used as a
predator of larvae of mosquitoes that can transmit dengue viruses.
Apparently, volunteers working with school children are being used to seed
water containers with these crustanceans and are having considerable
success. A doctor from the National Institute of Epidemiology in Hanoi
said that in 1995 they identified _Mesocyclops_ sp. in a lake in central
Hanoi and found they had a ferocious appetite for _Aedes aegypti_ larvae.
This mosquito can transmit dengue viruses. The report went on to say that
"The introduction of the Mesocyclops into the water reservoirs in the test
communes has yielded results beyond our expectations. One hundred percent
of these mosquitoes were eliminated in one commune, and 94% in five
others". The program is being financed by Australia and Great Britain.
The crustacean is laboratory-reared and sent to distance villages in moss
sponges, in which they can live for up to a month. - Mod.CHC]

[This is certainly not the first time that _Mesocyclops_ sp. have been used
for mosquito control. There are some drawbacks, however. First,
_Mesocyclops_ sp. usually can manage to devour only first instar larvae,
i.e., small larvae. Second, _Mesocyclops_ sp. are known intermediary hosts
for _Dracunculus medinensis_, the guinea worm, the etiologic agent of
dracunculiasis, _Vibrio cholerae_, the etiologic agent of cholera, and
other microorganisms. Therefore (third), control of mosquito larvae in
anything but confined containers is unlikely and potentially dangerous.
Nonetheless, when dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever are as great a
problem as they are in Vietnam, something needs to be tried. - Mod.CHC]
