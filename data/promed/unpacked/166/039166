New World screwworm (_Cochliomyia hominivorax_) in Panama - emergency report
---------------------------------------------------------
Translation of information received on 11 Apr 2003 (report dated 4 Apr
2003) from Dr Manuel Gonzalez Cano, national manager, Animal Health
Division, Ministry of Agricultural Development, Panama:
The animal health incident (laboratory diagnosed) was reported 27 Jan 2003
and the estimated date of first infection was 20 Jan 2003.
Outbreaks:
Location / No. of outbreaks
Colon / 27
Comarca / 9
Darien / 266
Panama / 131
Total number of animals in the outbreaks:
species / susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
bov (cattle) / 310 182 / 295 / ... / ... / ...
sui (pigs) / 99 518 / 79 / ... / ... / ...
equ (horses) / 40 580 / 40 / ... / ... / ...
can (dogs) / ... / 16 / ... / ... / ...
avi (birds) / 8 583 691 / 2 / ... / ... / ...
other / ... / 1 / ... / ... / ...
The diagnosis was made at the laboratory of vesicular disease diagnosis
(LADIVES), using species identification test.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: dispersal of fertile flies from
the sterile fly production plant, located in the state of Chiapas, Mexico.
B. Mode of spread: aerial.
C. Other epidemiological details: the process of eradicating New World
screwworm in Panama involves 2 well-defined areas -- the epidemiological
surveillance strip (FVE), which is an area extending from the western bank
of the Panama Canal to the border with Costa Rica, and the permanent
prevention barrier (BPP), which extends from the eastern bank of the Canal
to the border with Colombia. The FVE is the area free from New World
screwworm, in which no sterile flies have been dispersed since late 2001.
Due to a malfunction in the sterilization systems of the production plant
of the sterile fly production plant, fertile flies were inadvertently
released into the BPP, the area that was in the process of eradication.
Control measures:
- protection of the free area (FVE) and health education.
- in the infected zone (BPP):
a) control and eradication of outbreaks.
b) epidemiological surveillance.
c) health education.
d) dispersal of sterile flies (42 million per week).
e) control of animal movements.
