We have just learned about the 1st reported case of a horse with Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in the Upper Peninsula. The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development released the following statement on Friday [2 Oct 2020]:

Today, the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) is confirming the discovery of Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in a horse from Baraga County. Not only is this the 1st case of EEE being found in Michigan's Upper Peninsula for 2020, but it is also the 1st report of EEE ever being found in Baraga County. This case indicates the mosquitoes carrying EEE continue to be active, and all Michigan residents still need to take precautions to protect their animals as well as themselves.

EEE is a dangerous, zoonotic mosquito-borne disease typically seen in the state from late summer to early fall. Last year [2019], Michigan experienced 50 cases of EEE in animals and a record of 10 human cases. So far this year [2020], 2 human cases of EEE and 36 animal cases have been confirmed across 15 Michigan counties. The human cases of EEE have been confirmed in residents of Barry and Montcalm counties, and the Montcalm County resident has died.

"Our sympathies to the family and friends of this Michigan resident," said Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, chief medical executive and chief deputy for health at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS). "EEE is one of the most dangerous mosquito-borne diseases in the United States, which is why we made the decision to conduct aerial treatment last month [September 2020]. We continue to urge Michiganders to take precautions against mosquitoes."

The latest reports of the disease involve horses found in Livingston and Baraga counties. To see the presence of EEE so far northward in the Upper Peninsula is not uncommon. Last year [2019], 2 cases of the disease were reported in animals from Houghton and Ontonagon counties. Also, while the Baraga County case is the 1st case of the disease in the Upper Peninsula this year [2020], Wisconsin has had a number of EEE cases within their northern counties, including Forest County, which borders the Upper Peninsula.

"Given the trends of EEE and other mosquito-borne diseases over the last 2 years, owners of horses and other animals across the entire state need to make vaccines and mosquito mitigation practices routine," said State Veterinarian Nora Wineland, DVM. "The mortality rate of EEE in horses can be as high as 90%, so it's unlikely you'll get a 2nd chance to vaccinate an animal after it becomes infected. And, even though mosquito season is coming to a close as the weather gets colder, it is important for owners to work with their veterinarian to ensure proper timing of vaccination."

While the state of Michigan has been experiencing some cooler temperatures this week, the mosquitoes carrying EEE will remain alive and active until there has been at least 1 hard freeze where the temperatures fall below 28 deg F [-2 C] for several hours. Therefore, it is still necessary to eliminate standing water on one's property, bring animals into a barn from dusk to dawn to avoid peak mosquito activity, vaccinate horses against the disease, and contact a veterinarian if an animal displays any sign of illness.

"Living in the Upper Peninsula, it's easy to feel insulated from some of the issues happening south of the Mackinac Bridge," said MDARD Director Gary McDowell, a resident of Chippewa County in the Upper Peninsula. "EEE is carried primarily between mosquitoes and bird reservoir hosts, so there are no natural geographic barriers protecting animals or people. Every Michigan resident needs to be cognizant of this and take all necessary precautions."

In humans, signs of EEE include the sudden onset of fever, chills, and body and joint aches. EEE infection can develop into severe encephalitis, resulting in headache, disorientation, tremors, seizures, and paralysis. Permanent brain damage, coma, and death may also occur in some cases.

In early September [2020], the increasing number of EEE cases being discovered in equine prompted MDHHS to initiate aerial treatments to mitigate the spread of the disease and help protect human health. This resulted in 462 000 acres [187 000 hectares] treated. MDHHS will continue to monitor the situation, and treatment zones could be added if new cases are found and aerial treatment would be effective to reducing risk of exposure.

Applying insect repellants, wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants, and following other precautions can help Michigan residents avoid mosquito bites and stay healthy.

On 25 Sep 2020, the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD) officials confirmed 2 unvaccinated horses with Eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE), bringing the state's total confirmed cases to 32 for the year.

The affected horses include a 20-year-old Arabian mare in Oakland County and an 11-year-old pony mare in Tuscola County. The pony mare is Tuscola County's 1st case in 2020.

Both equines began showing clinical signs on 12 Sep 2020 The Oakland County mare's signs consisted of recumbency (down and unable to rise), and she was humanely euthanized.

The Tuscola County mare's signs included ataxia (loss of muscle control) and tremors. She is reported as recovering.

Eastern equine encephalomyelitis is caused by the Eastern equine encephalitis virus, for which wild birds are a natural reservoir. Mosquitoes that feed on EEE-infected birds can transmit the virus to humans, horses, and other birds. Horses do not develop high enough levels of these viruses in their blood to be contagious to other animals or humans. Because of the high mortality rate in horses and humans, EEE is regarded as one of the most serious mosquito-borne diseases in the USA.

Tips for preventing mosquito-borne diseases include:
- Avoid mosquito bites: Use insect repellent when outdoors, especially from dusk to dawn.
- Look for EPA-labeled products containing active ingredients such as DEET, picaridin (KBR3023), or oil of lemon eucalyptus (p-menthane 3,8-diol).
- Apply more repellent, according to label instructions, if mosquitoes start to bite.
- Mosquito-proof homes: Fix or install window and door screens, and cover or eliminate empty containers with standing water where mosquitoes can lay eggs.
- Protect your horses: Veterinarians recommend commercially available licensed vaccines against EEE for all horses in the USA. Horses should be vaccinated at least annually (recommendations vary in high-risk areas). It's not too late this year [2020] to vaccinate your horses.
- Use approved insect repellents to protect horses.
- If possible, put horses in stables, stalls, or barns during the prime mosquito exposure hours of dusk and dawn.
- Eliminate standing water, drain water troughs, and empty buckets at least weekly.
- Stock water tanks with fish for consuming mosquito larvae (contact your local mosquito control for assistance), or use mosquito "dunks" (solid "donuts" of _Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis_ [BTi], which are nontoxic to horses) available at hardware stores.

The Lincoln County Health Department reports a horse in Lincoln County has tested positive for Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE). The report comes after 2 human cases of disease this year [2020] in Eau Claire and Chippewa counties. There have also been reports of several other EEE cases in horses in northern and western regions of Wisconsin.

EEE virus is spread to humans, horses, and other animals through the bite of an infected mosquito, which pick up the disease by feeding on infected birds. The virus is not spread person to person or directly between animals or between animals and humans. Presence of an EEE-positive horse confirms there are mosquitoes in the area infected with the EEE virus that can spread the virus to people and other animals. [The paragraph above states 2 human cases this year; wouldn't those cases indicate the disease was circulating in mosquitoes? - Mod.TG]

Even though temperatures have cooled off, as long as mosquitoes are active, the risk of EEE and other illnesses spread by mosquitoes can continue through much of the fall. Since EEE virus is known to be circulating in Lincoln County, the health department urges people to be vigilant in preventing mosquito bites.

Many people infected with EEE virus do not get sick, but it can cause serious illness in some cases. Those who do become ill may develop fever, headache, chills, and vomiting. The illness may become severe, resulting in encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), disorientation, seizures, coma, or death. There is no specific vaccine or treatment for EEE illness available for people.

Signs of EEE infection in horses include depression, loss of appetite, drooping eyelids and lower lip, blindness, paralysis, and death. Horse owners can vaccinate their horses against EEE virus to protect them from becoming ill.

According to information from the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC), 3 horses in Lambton County, Ontario, were confirmed as having contracted Eastern equine encephalitis.

The EDCC, by way of the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, reported the 3 horses -- 2 Quarter Horse geldings, 20 and 11 years old; and a yearling filly -- began to display the signs of the disease on 22 Sep 2020 and were confirmed as positive for encephalitis on 9 Oct 2020. All 3 horses succumbed to the illness.

The EDCC reported both geldings were from the same farm and the filly was located on a farm 5 miles away. No quarantine is in place.

Eastern equine encephalitis is a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes and other biting insects. Horses affected with the disease are not contagious and do not pose a risk to other horses or humans. While a rare disease, it is extremely severe, with only 5% to 25% of horses infected surviving.

For more information on Eastern equine encephalitis, please refer to this fact sheet from the American Association of Equine Practitioners: https://aaep.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Outside%20Linked%20Documents/DiseaseFactsheet_EEE%20Cobranded.pdf.

[Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is preventable in horses. The vaccine for EEE is usually combined with some other mosquito-borne diseases, such as West Nile virus (WNV) and Western equine encephalitis (WEE). These vaccines usually have tetanus included, hence a lot of protection for the dollars spent. The vaccine is a series of 2-3 vaccines given 3-4 weeks apart.

There is a vaccine for horses but not for humans. Yet so many horse owners are negligent and do not vaccinate. This can be a fatal error for your horse. Please vaccinate, even though you may think the mosquito season is nearly over. A single storm can relocate mosquitoes and bring EEE back to your area.

EEE protection wanes the fastest, and in areas where the prevalence of the disease is high, horse owners are encouraged to revaccinate approximately every 3-4 months for best protection. If you have not already vaccinated your horse, please take immediate steps to get the animal(s) vaccinated. It may well save their life. - Mod.TG
