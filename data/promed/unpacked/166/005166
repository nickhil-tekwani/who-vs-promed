confirmed positive by splenic aspirate. The
patients have been admitted to Wajir District
Hospital in the neighbouring North Eastern
Province. Other suspect cases have also been

More than 30 children have been admitted to
hospital in the northeastern Kenyan town of Wajir
with symptoms of kala-azar, a deadly parasitic
disease characterised by anemia and inflammation
of the liver and spleen, health officials
said. Almost all the cases in the Wajir District
Hospital had come from Merti administrative
division of the neighbouring Isiolo district,
according to Ahmeddin Omar, the doctor in charge of the hospital.
"We have received 22 patients this [Thursday]
morning in addition to the 10 last week," said
Omar, adding that those affected were mainly
children between the ages of one and 13 years.
Most were younger than 5, he added.
Omar said the hospital was using a drug known as
Pentostam, which he described as the "1st-line"
kala-azar treatment. "We are expecting more
patients and we require support in terms of
drugs," he added. More supplies of the drug were
on the way to Wajir from Isiolo and Garissa, the
administrative headquarters of the northeastern
province. "We are not even sure the hospital will
be able to cope if patients continue coming," he added.
No deaths had so far been reported in Wajir
District Hospital, according to Omar. Medical
teams had been sent to the affected villages in
Isiolo to investigate the outbreak, he added.
Kala-azar, also known as visceral leishmaniasis,
is caused by parasitic protozoa transmitted to
humans by the bite of infected female sandflies,
according to the United Nations World Health
Organization. The disease [affects] the immune
system, causes persistent fever, anemia, liver
and spleen enlargement, and is fatal if untreated.

[A study of visceral leishmaniasis, VL, in Kenya
diagnosed 904 patients from an area which spanned
the Wajir and Mandera districts of northeastern
Kenya, southern Somalia, and southeastern
Ethiopia. These areas were either previously
non-endemic for VL or had only sporadic cases
prior to the epidemic. The study describes the
features of the outbreak and reviews the history
of VL in the region. Unusual rainfall patterns,
malnutrition, and migration of a
Leishmania-infected population seeking food and
security may have contributed to this outbreak.
(Marlet MV et al., Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg. 2003;97:515-8).
Another study from 2000 of VL in refugees from
Somalia entering northeastern Kenya (Boussery G
et al., Emerg Infect Dis. 2001;7(3 Suppl):603-4)
speculates that the deteriorating nutitrional
status of the refugees played a role in the increased incidence of VL.
The present increase in cases is most probably
part of a larger outbreak of the entire region
including eastern Ethiopia, Somalia, and
northeastern Kenya. Leishmaniasis is a
HIV-related infection, and it is important to
know the proportion of patients with VL who are
also HIV-positive -- see 1997 ref. below. - Mod.EP]
