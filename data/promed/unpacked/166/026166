Chronic wasting disease in new region of Wyoming
------------------------------------------------
For the first time, a fatal brain malady of elk and deer has been discovered
in north-central Wyoming. A white-tailed buck and a mule deer taken in the
Kaycee area last month [October 2004] were both found to have chronic
wasting disease (CWD), Wyoming Game and Fish officials announced on Friday
[19 Nov 2004].
"Although CWD has been found in southeastern Wyoming for a number of
years, this is the first time we have found CWD in the east slope Big
Horn Mountains," said Warren Mischke, spokesman for the agency's
Sheridan Region.
The white-tailed deer was killed by a hunter on 22 Oct 2004 and taken
to a local processing plant. Department personnel noticed the animal
was very thin and decided to collect the lymph nodes for analysis.
The Game and Fish lab in Laramie reported the result on 12 Nov 2004.
The same day, results revealed chronic wasting disease in the mule
deer, which had been killed on 24 Oct 2004.
So far, the laboratory has tested 120 animals from Hunt Areas 30 and
33, where the diseased deer had been taken. "We may need to collect
more deer to learn additional information about the distribution of
CWD in and around this new area," said Dan Thiele, a Game and Fish
wildlife biologist based in Buffalo. "Current research indicated
infested animals tend to be found in localized groups, or clusters.
Taking 25 to 30 deer out of the immediate area will allow us to see
how well established CWD may be in the area, and, potentially limit
the spread."
Officials are hoping to obtain more hunter-harvested samples from the
area. Hunters can contribute to surveillance efforts by having deer
or elk tested, Thiele said. A total of 3269 hunter-harvested deer and
elk in Wyoming have been tested this fall, with 70 testing positive
for the disease. Besides Kaycee, 2 other new areas were found to have
the illness present: southwest of Laramie and near Elk Mountain.
Chronic wasting disease attacks the brains of infected animals,
causing them to display abnormal behavior and eventually become
emaciated and die. There is no evidence the disease can spread to
people.
Once thought to exist only in the wild in northeastern Colorado and
southeastern Wyoming, the ailment has also been found in deer and elk
in Wisconsin, Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska, Montana, New Mexico,
Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah, and in 2 Canadian provinces

[Portions of Wyoming and Colorado have had this disease present for a number
of years. Depending upon the range of the herd, available nutrition,
population pressures, available feeding grounds, and possibly other
influences, the animals may have ranged through normal movement into this
new area. Continued surveillance may provide information as to how the
disease entered. - Mod.TG]
