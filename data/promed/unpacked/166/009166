Antimicrobial resistance to clinically relevant antibiotics for _Neisseria meningitidis_ was rare among isolates collected from 2012 through 2016 for a study in the United States. "Reduced susceptibility of _Neisseria meningitidis_ to clinically relevant antibiotics has historically been uncommon in the United States," Henju Marjuki, PhD, a researcher in the CDC's Division of Bacterial Diseases, told Healio.

"More recently, however, detection of a beta-lactamase-positive, penicillin-resistant meningococcal strain in the U.S. has led to guidance that health care providers should ascertain susceptibility of meningococcal isolates to penicillin before using penicillin or ampicillin for treatment," Marjuki said [https://www.healio.com/news/pediatrics/20200619/antibioticresistant-n-meningitidis-emerges-in-us].

Marjuki explained that the CDC previously published a study of _N. meningitidis_ antimicrobial resistance in samples collected in 2004, 2008, 2010 and 2011. Results of that study showed that resistance to antimicrobials used for empirical treatment of meningitis in the U.S. was not detected during those years [https://www.healio.com/news/infectious-disease/20150902/n-meningitidis-remains-susceptible-to-antibiotics].

"The present study assessed the antimicrobial susceptibility of _N. meningitidis_ isolates collected from 2012 to 2016 to determine if changes in susceptibility were observed during this time period compared to historical trends," Marjuki said.

Marjuki and colleagues collected 695 meningococcal isolates through population-based surveillance from 2012 through 2016 and national surveillance from 2015 through 2016 and assessed them for antimicrobial susceptibility.

They found that all the isolates were susceptible to azithromycin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, meropenem, minocycline and rifampin, and that around 25% of isolates showed intermediate susceptibility to penicillin and ampicillin. Less than 1% of isolates were penicillin, ampicillin, ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin resistant.

Marjuki said that resistance to ciprofloxacin -- used for meningococcal prophylaxis -- has also been detected and that clinicians and public health staff should consider conducting antimicrobial susceptibility testing on meningococcal isolates to "inform prophylaxis decisions if their state has reported a case of meningococcal disease caused by ciprofloxacin-resistant strains within the past 2 years."

"Abstract
--------
"Background
Historically, antimicrobial resistance has been rare in US invasive meningococcal disease cases.

"Methods
Meningococcal isolates (n = 695) were collected through population-based surveillance, 2012-2016, and national surveillance, 2015-2016. Antimicrobial susceptibility was assessed by broth microdilution. Resistance mechanisms were characterized using whole genome sequencing.

"Results
All isolates were susceptible to 6 antibiotics (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, meropenem, rifampin, minocycline, and azithromycin). Approximately 25% were penicillin- or ampicillin-intermediate; among these, 79% contained mosaic penA gene mutations. Less than 1% of isolates were penicillin-, ampicillin-, ciprofloxacin-, or levofloxacin-resistant.

"Conclusion
Penicillin- and ampicillin-intermediate isolates were common, but resistance to clinically relevant antibiotics remained rare."

_Neisseria meningitidis_ is a strictly human Gram-negative pathogen that causes life-threatening invasive meningococcal disease (IMD), including meningitis and blood stream infection (meningococcemia). Meningococci are grouped by the serologic specificity of their polysaccharide capsule; 6 serogroups (A, B, C, W, X, and Y) cause most infections. In the US, most cases of IMD are caused by serogroups B, C, and Y. Several vaccines are available for prevention of IMD, such as MenB and conjugated MenACWY vaccines.

Antibiotics are used empirically to treat (the 3rd generation cephalosporins, cefotaxime, or ceftriaxone) and to prevent (ciprofloxacin, rifampin, and ceftriaxone) IMD. Once the microbial diagnosis is confirmed, targeted treatment options include cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, penicillin G or ampicillin. In addition, penicillin chemoprophylaxis for IMD is recommended for individuals while being treated with complement inhibitors, such as eculizumab or ravulizumab (https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/about/soliris-patients.html).

However, resistance or reduced susceptibility to these antibiotics have been reported. For example, resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins has been infrequently reported (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27733517/). Beta-lactamase production (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6125549/) and alterations of the penA gene, which encodes penicillin binding protein 2, the target for penicillin (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1438422115000880) have been described. Also, mutations affecting binding sites for rifampicin (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3367591/) and ciprofloxacin (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa0806414) have been described. _N. meningitidis_ serogroup Y isolates that are both penicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant have also been detected in the United States (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6924a2.htm?s_cid=mm6924a2_w).

Because initial empiric antimicrobial treatment of life-threatening IMD with a 3rd-generation cephalosporin (cefotaxime and ceftriaxone) is the widely accepted standard recommendation (https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/39/9/1267/402080), resistance of _N. meningitidis_ to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone is very worrisome, but still very rare. The US CDC recommends checking results of antibiotic susceptibility testing of the infecting strain in patients with IMD before switching from empirical treatment with a 3rd-generation cephalosporin to penicillin or ampicillin. Also, the CDC recommends knowing the frequency of ciprofloxacin-resistance of meningococci in the community to inform prophylaxis decisions; but they caution antibiotic susceptibility testing should not delay the initiation of prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin, rifampin, or ceftriaxone (https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2020/han00433.asp?deliveryName=USCDC_511-DM31059). - Mod.ML
