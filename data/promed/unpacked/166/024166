Scientists have discovered a potential treatment for a cancer that has ravaged Australia's Tasmanian devil population.

The infectious facial cancer has wiped out 80 percent of wild devils since it was first identified in 1996.

By injecting live cancer cells, researchers have used immunotherapy for the 1st time to successfully treat the disease.

The breakthrough is hoped to fast-track development of an effective vaccine, said the international research team.

The treatment successfully eradicated tumours as big as golf balls, said co-author Prof Greg Woods of the University of Tasmania.

"When we saw those tumours get smaller it was so exciting," he said. "This is almost a eureka moment for us because it's the 1st time we can say for sure that it was the immunotherapy that was making the tumour shrink."

Devil facial tumour disease (DFTD), one of just 3 known transmissible cancers, typically kills nearly every devil it infects.

Researchers injected 5 captive animals with the immunotherapy treatment, likened to "fighting cancer with cancer", over a 6-year period. 3 of them survived.

"This is an important step along the way to developing a vaccine to protect against DFTD and potentially for immunotherapy to cure devils of established DFTD," Prof Woods said.

Co-author Dr Bruce Lyons said the study offered the best hope yet for the carnivorous marsupial, which is unique to Tasmania. However, it was not yet practical for treating the whole population. "It's not feasible to track down and immunise every animal in the wild," Dr Lyons told the BBC.

The surviving devils from the study have since died of natural causes.

In the 2 decades since disease was first documented, the population of devils has dropped from 150 000 to approximately 30 000.

Essentially a single tumour that jumps between hosts, DFTD is transferred when the aggressive beasts bite each other's snouts.

Last year [2016], a genetic study uncovered signs that the animals were rapidly evolving to defend themselves against DFTD.

Tasmanian devils (_Sarcophilus harrisii_) are threatened with extinction by devil facial tumour disease (DFTD), a directly transmissible cancer in which live tumour cells are transmitted directly between hosts through intimate contact (mostly by biting). They consist of cells that are clonally derived from an original neoplastic cell in a long-dead host and are genetically distinct from their current host individual. Transmissible tumours share most of the characteristics of a typical microparasite, such as prolific replication within the host. Transmission of this cancerous cell line is possible due to low host genetic diversity, particularly in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Thus, the immune system of the devil fails to recognize foreign tumour cells as non-self, and the tumour is passed on as an allograft between susceptible and infected hosts. DFTD has been proved to be consistently fatal, with infected individuals succumbing to the disease between 6 and 12 months after the detection of clinical signs. This caused a severe decline in the Tasmanian devil population. It has been estimated that this decline reached over 80 percent of the devil population before the tumor was recognized in 1996.

The development consisted of MHC-I expression on DFTD cells as components of immunizations and immunotherapy, which resulted in anti-DFTD tumour humoral and cellular responses. This shows that developing a vaccine to counter this disease is feasible. However, further studies are needed before effective immune control of DFTD can be achieved. It is also noteworthy that once this development is completed, treating individuals in the wild will prove extremely challenging. - Mod.PMB
