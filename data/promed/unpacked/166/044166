A fresh outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) has been identified in a
village named Gokulnagar, 30 km from the capital city Dhaka.
Tissue samples were collected from infected animals (vesicular tissue of
tongue) and the virus involved was identified as FMD serotype O (Pan Asian)
by ELISA using a kit provided by the World Reference Laboratory, UK via
Animal Production and Health Section, FAO/IAEA Joint Division, Vienna.
For the last 2 years the dominant FMD virus serotype identified was O,
which was introduced during 1990. Because of massive movement and gathering
of animals throughout the country during the Eid-Ul-Azha Festival (7 Mar
2001) the disease may spread to other areas of the country. Some animals
in the market showed symptoms similar to those of FMD.
A British-style policy of stamping out FMD is not economically feasible for
Bangladesh; hence, we are using a ring vaccination policy to stop the
further spread of disease.
