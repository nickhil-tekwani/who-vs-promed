Pertussis (whooping cough) cases in Ballarat have skyrocketed in recent years, new figures show. Ballarat recorded 218 whooping cough cases in 2014, compared to 27 in 2013 and 38 in 2012, according to Department of Health figures. 9 whooping cough cases have already been recorded so far in 2015.

Grampians Medicare Local immunization coordinator Breeanne Fratin said there were several reasons for the sudden spike, including family members no longer having whooping cough immunity, current vaccine protection wearing off, and anti-vaccination protesters not immunizing their children. She said a recent whooping cough study showed parents were the source of infection in more than 50 percent of cases due to their immunity fading over time.

"You also need to make sure older children are fully immunized, with whooping cough boosters at 4 years and again in high school," Ms Fratin said. She also urged grandparents and friends to make sure their needles were up to date, with the state government announcing a return of the free pertussis vaccine program that was axed in 2012.

"Anti-vaccination protesters are also creating more opportunity for a pertussis outbreak and Grampians Medicare Local would encourage them to speak to their local provider if they have any concerns or questions," Ms Fratin said.

Statewide, there has been a 57.7 percent increase in whooping cough cases, rising from 2926 in 2013 to 4615 in 2014, with children less than one year old particularly vulnerable.

State Health Minister Jill Hennessy said the government expected more than 80 000 Victorians to now be vaccinated annually. "Whooping cough is highly contagious and, if parents aren't immunized, they could pass it on to their newborn baby," Ms Hennessy said.

[Research by both Dr Frits R Mooi from the Netherlands (Pertussis - Australia (04): newly emerging clones, discussion 20120322.1078115) and Dr Lyn Gilbert from Australia (Pertussis - Australia (03): newly emerging clones 20120321.1076103) have been previously highlighted in ProMED-mail reflecting antigenic changes in circulating clones of _Bordetella pertussis_, which may be one of a number of factors causing the increased number of pertussis cases throughout the world. These changes may result in a need for modifications of the currently used acellular pertussis vaccines. - Mod.LL
