The Central Epidemic Command Center for Rabies yesterday [Sat 17 Aug 2013] announced an additional 4 confirmed cases of rabies found in wild ferret-badgers, adding Tainan's Zuojhen District and Pingtung's Wutai Township to the list of locations where the disease has spread. As of Fri 16 Aug 2013, the Animal Health Research Institute inspected a total of 356 wild carnivores. Excluding 87 ferret-badgers, the others all tested negative for rabies.

The confirmed cases of rabies were found in wild ferret-badgers spread out across 9 counties and cities, including 42 townships and villages. The Center inspected 36 animals on Friday [16 Aug 2013] and found that 4 ferret-badgers, from Taichung's Heping District, Tainan's Zuojhen District, Pingtung's Wutai Township, and Taitung's Beinan Township, had contracted rabies. The remaining 32 all tested negative for the disease.

The Center said that the local animal disease prevention authorities in Tainan and Pingtung have stepped up their efforts to vaccinate cats and dogs in the mountainous areas. According to local reports, the government has so far received 2517 applications for rabies vaccinations against animal bites and scratches. Of the more than 2000 applications, 1755 have been approved.
