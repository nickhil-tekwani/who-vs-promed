It was supposed to be a special New Year's Eve dinner for a Washington [state] woman's 4 pugs but the woman says after eating their treat, her beloved dogs got deathly ill.

[Owner NM] loves her 4 pugs -- Tank, Tito, Tinkerbell, and Talula. Tito's still coughing after his close call on New Year's Eve [31 Dec 2016].

[NM] says she fed all 4 dog's Evanger's Hunk of Beef with Au Jus canned dog food as a treat. "I fed them one can and within 15 minutes they were acting drunk, walking around, then they couldn't walk and were falling over," [the woman] said. "I grabbed them all and I took them to the emergency vet and when I got them there they were limp. They weren't moving or anything." All 4 dogs went into intensive care.

[NM] picked up the last of the survivors, Tito, Monday morning [2 Jan 2017] but Talula died. The family put Talula's remains in a cooler for the trip to a necropsy at Oregon State University [OSU] to figure out what killed her. [The woman] suspects it was something in the dog food. "Tito, we got to bring him home today [3 Jan 2017]. He still suffers from seizures. I don't know how long, I don't know if there's any long-term on the other 2, but it's terrible."

Evangers Pet Food, the dog food maker, contributed to the full fundraising goal on Nikki's You Caring fundraising page for vet bills.

The company told KATU News it's started an investigation.

[NM] says she wants other pet owners to stop using the canned dog food for now. "I lost my dog and it shouldn't have to be this way." She says she's not sure how long it will take OSU animal experts to determine what may have killed her dog.

Meanwhile, no recall has been issued but an Evanger's representative said the company is making arrangements to get unopened cans in the same case to have them tested. The company will take back any product from customers who have concerns, no questions asked.

[The company seems to be issuing a recall of the lot number so hopefully there are flyers and public service announcements about this situation.

The 1st thing that came to mind was perhaps ethylene glycol, but the 15 minute time frame was far too quick to be ethylene glycol (antifreeze). High doses of ethanol may produce similar signs, but how it would be a contaminant is unclear.

We do not know anything about the clinical signs from the veterinarian's point of view so there may be other clues currently unavailable to us from the news article. More information on the clinical picture of the illness in the days as well as results of the necropsy would be greatly appreciated.

Hopefully we learn more as the company searches out the cause of these illnesses and death. - Mod.TG
