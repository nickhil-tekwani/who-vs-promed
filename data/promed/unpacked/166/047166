=95Japan suspects U.S. cress seeds may be linked to their E. coli
outbreaks:
The Japanese Health and Welfare Ministry has said it suspects that the
epidemic of E. coli O-157 which claimed three lives and made more than
5,700 people ill in Sakai, Osaka Prefecture last year, can be traced to
cress seeds from the United States. The Ministry failed to conclusively
determine the source of infection in that outbreak, but it suspected
cress served in school lunches was the most likely vehicle. The Ministry
now suspects that cress which was implicated in the E. coli outbreaks
last March in Gamagori, central Japan, and Yokohama, southwest of Tokyo,
were grown from seeds that were contaminated by this organism. Ministry
officials said the seeds came from the same farm in Kanagawa Prefecture,
southeast of Tokyo, which imported them from the state of Oregon. Cress
seeds suspected as the vehicle in the Sakai outbreak were also imported
from Oregon, but it is uncertain whether they came from the same place
as those found in Gamagori and Yokohama.=20
The Ministry apparently plans to ask the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo next week to
pass its inspection request to the CDC and the FDA. U.S. companies involved
in exporting cress seeds to Japan will launch a voluntary seed inspection
program, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries officials were
quoted as saying. If the seeds are water cultured, the bacillus is likely to
proliferate and to contaminate grown cress, experts said.
[Having been accused of demonstrating editorial prejudice, I will leave it
to others to comment on the probability of the above being a valid
hypothesis. Please note the word "probability". AHEAD-Mod MHJ]
