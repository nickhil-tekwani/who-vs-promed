Romania has reported an outbreak of African swine fever [ASF] at a breeding farm for pigs in the southern county of Tulcea, the national food safety authority ANSVSA said on [Mon 2 Jul 2018].

It said all pigs on the holding, or 44 580, would be culled. "Carcasses of pigs are being destroyed under official supervision, with support from the defense ministry which brought 4 mobile incinerators."

In June [2018], Romania reported an outbreak of ASF among backyard pigs in the same county.

African swine fever is a highly contagious disease that affects pigs and wild boar and has spread in Eastern Europe in recent years. It does not affect humans.

Hungary, Russia, Poland, Ukraine and Romania are among the countries affected, alarming governments and pig farmers due the pace at which it has spread.

[Since the start of the ASF event in Romania's Tulcea county, on 9 Jun 2018, the disease has affected wild boar and domestic swine in small holdings. The current outbreak has become the 1st one to affect a commercial enterprise.

The summary of the event, as of 29 Jun 2018, follows:
Total outbreaks = 140 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Swine / 1361 / 589 / 52 / 1311 / 0
Wild boar / 902 / 8 / 8 / 0 / 0
(see all reports and map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000027093_20180629_165833.pdf).

ASF in a commercial breeding pig farm is concerning news. On top of the financial losses incurred by the disease itself, the need to cull a large number of valuable stock and trade restrictions, severe measures should be applied to prevent the enterprise becoming a source of wide-scale virus spread within the pig industry.

ASF incubation period is generally regarded to be of 5 - 21 days duration; acute disease typically appears in 3 to 7 days. Hopefully, the breeding farm's professionals and the veterinary authorities have managed to discover the route of introduction and, in particular, to prevent a leakage from the enterprise, directly or otherwise.
