Pakistan
- Up to 2 new wild poliovirus 1 (WPV1) positive environmental samples were reported in the last week [week of Sun 22 Oct 2017], one from Peshawar district, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, collection [Tue 10 Oct 2017], and one from Karachi Gadap district, Sindh province, collection [Thu 12 Oct 2017].
- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week [week of Sun 22 Oct 2017]. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2017 in Pakistan remains 5.
- Sub-national immunization days (SNIDs) are currently underway in Pakistan, aiming to protect over 21 million children from polio using bivalent oral polio vaccine.
- Planning has begun for the next set of national immunization days, scheduled for later this month [November 2017].

Nigeria
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week [week of Sun 22 Oct 2017]. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016] in Monguno Local Government Area, Borno.
- Nigeria continues to implement an emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016).
- Detection of polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission. As part of the emergency response, subnational surveillance continues to be strengthened.
- The final stages of planning are underway for the next set of subnational immunization days, taking place in the coming week [week of Sun 5 Nov 2017]. Vaccinators intend to use bOPV vaccine to protect over 10 million children under the age of 5 years from polio.

Lake Chad Basin
- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno state, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto states in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin.
- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.
- These activities include efforts to vaccinate children at markets, in internally displaced persons camps, and at international borders.
- The 2nd Outbreak Response Assessment (OBRA) for the region has begun. This is taking place from [29 Oct 2017-10 Nov 2017] in the Central African Republic and in Nigeria, and from [1-15 Nov 2017] in Chad and Niger. The OBRA teams aim to construct a detailed picture of the outbreak response in each country, to help inform next steps.
- Planning is in the final stages to ensure that immunization days in early November [2017] in all Lake Chad Basin countries go ahead as planned.

Central Africa
- One new case of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) was reported this week [week of Sun 29 Oct 2017] in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). The case was reported from Ankoro district, Tanganika province, with onset of paralysis on [Thu 14 Sep 2017].
- This raises the total number of cVDPV2 cases this year [2017] to 10. This most recent case is linked to an outbreak this year in Haut Lomami province, where the onset of paralysis of the most recent case was [Thu 27 Jul 2017].
- A separate outbreak occurred in Maniema province earlier this year [2017], consisting of 2 cases with onset of paralysis on [26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017], with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May [2017].
- Outbreak response continues to take place across the DRC, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols.
- The next routine immunization activity, taking place later this month [November 2017], is a mop-up campaign of Tshopo province, and several provinces in the south of the country. Using mOPV2, vaccinators aim to protect over 800 000 children from polio.
- Surveillance and immunization activities continue to be strengthened in neighbouring countries.

Middle East
- In Syria, one new case of cVDPV2 was reported this week [week of Sun 29 Oct 2017] from Mayadeen district, Deir Ez-Zor governorate. The case concerns a child aged 15 months, who had previously received one dose of OPV, and no doses of IPV. The date of onset of the case was [Fri 18 Aug 2017].
- The most recent case (by date of onset) remains [Fri 25 Aug 2017]. All confirmed cases to date have had onset of paralysis between [3 Mar 2017 and 25 Aug 2017].
- The total number of cVDPV2 cases in Syria in 2017 is now 53.
- Following the completion of the 2nd outbreak response round for Deir Ez-Zor and Raqqa governorate, 3rd party independent monitoring results for the Raqqa round have been received. Reported coverage of targeted children is 69 percent (measured by parental recall through a house to house survey). Market surveys reported much higher coverage of 84 percent.
- Additional IPV immunization aiming to reach children aged between 2-23 months of age in high risk areas of Aleppo and Idlib has concluded. IPV activities in Hama governorate are ongoing. Total administrative coverage to date reports that 223 001 children between 2-23 months of age were vaccinated (representing 98 percent of the target).
- 16 new refrigerator trucks have been provided by UNICEF to transport vaccine and maintain the cold chain for ongoing response activities and outreach.
- WHO is supporting the upgrade of laboratory facilities to enable more sophisticated techniques to be conducted in country for the detection of poliovirus. WHO is also supporting the establishment of environmental surveillance in country by end of 2017.

[Take away messages from the above report:
- Up to 2 more WPV1 associated polio cases reported in Afghanistan in 2 different provinces (one an advanced report for next week's official reporting which will raise the total global case count of WPV1 cases this year (2017) to 14 and in Afghanistan to 9.
- 3 new WPV1 positive environmental samples reported from 2 different provinces in Afghanistan (one of which has not reported any WPV1 associated cases of polio)
- 2 new WPV1 positive environmental samples reported in Pakistan from 2 different provinces.
- Up to 1 new cVDPV2 associated case in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in a new province but related to the outbreak ongoing in Haut Lomami province
- Up to 1 new cVDPV2 associated polio case reported from Syria.

There is still ongoing circulation of WPV1 in Afghanistan and Pakistan; and ongoing circulation of cVDPV2 in Syria and the Dem. Rep. of the Congo. Based on the experience in Nigeria with an estimated 4 years of silent circulation of the WPV1 in an area of intense civil strife, one might question how many years will have to pass before one can be certain that transmission of the WPV1 has truly been interrupted in these areas of civil strife where vaccination activities have been interrupted by the civil strife.

The weekly reports are presenting information from environmental sampling in Pakistan and Afghanistan. There is no mention of environmental sampling results in Nigeria and other countries. How many countries are doing environmental sampling? Do they include countries with known ongoing civil strife?

[2] cVDPV update - MMWR
Date: Thu 2 Nov 2017
Source: MMWR 3 Nov 2017 66(43);1185-1191 [excerpted]

Update on Vaccine-Derived Polioviruses - Worldwide, January 2016-June 2017
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: Jorba J, Diop OM, Iber J, Henderson E, Sutter RW, Wassilak SGF, Burns CC.

Summary:
What is already known about this topic?
Vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs), strains that are genetically divergent from the oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) viruses, fall into 3 categories: 1) circulating VDPVs (cVDPVs) from outbreaks, 2) immunodeficiency-associated VDPVs (iVDPVs) from patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs), and 3) ambiguous VDPVs (aVDPVs), which cannot be more definitively identified. cVDPVs are biologically equivalent to wild polioviruses, emerge in settings of low population immunity, and can sustain long-term circulation. Because greater than 94 percent of cVDPVs since 2006 and 69 percent of iVDPVs since OPV introduction are type 2, the World Health Organization coordinated worldwide replacement of trivalent OPV (tOPV, types 1, 2, and 3) with bivalent OPV (bOPV, types 1 and 3) in April 2016.

What is added by this report?
During 2017, new cVDPV outbreaks were detected in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (2 emergences) and Syria (one emergence). Residual circulation of a previous cVDPV2 emergence in Nigeria was detected in 2016 and low-level detection of new emergences in Nigeria and Pakistan occurred during 2016. Up to 14 newly identified persons in 10 countries were found to excrete iVDPVs.

What are the implications for public health practice?
The goal of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative is the cessation of all poliovirus circulation. The risk for VDPV emergence will continue as long as OPV is used. The switch from tOPV to bOPV in April 2016 was the 1st step toward phasing out the use of all OPV, setting the stage for a subsequent total worldwide shift from OPV to IPV.

In 1988, the World Health Assembly launched the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) (1). Among the 3 wild poliovirus (WPV) serotypes, only type 1 (WPV1) has been detected since 2012. Since 2014, detection of WPV1 has been limited to 3 countries, with 37 cases in 2016 and 11 cases in 2017 as of September 27. The greater than 99.99 percent decline worldwide in polio cases since the launch of the GPEI is attributable to the extensive use of the live, attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in mass vaccination campaigns and comprehensive national routine immunization programs. Despite its well-established safety record, OPV use can be associated with rare emergence of genetically divergent vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) whose genetic drift from the parental OPV strains indicates prolonged replication or circulation (2). VDPVs can also emerge among persons with primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs). Immunodeficiency-associated VDPVs (iVDPVs) can replicate for years in some persons with PIDs. In addition, circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) can emerge very rarely among immunologically normal vaccine recipients and their contacts in areas with inadequate OPV coverage and can cause outbreaks of paralytic polio. This report updates previous summaries regarding VDPVs (3). During January 2016-June 2017, new cVDPV outbreaks were identified, including 2 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) (8 cases), and another in Syria (35 cases [see above report [1] updating these figures to 53 in Syria and 10 in the DR Congo]), whereas the circulation of cVDPV type 2 (cVDPV2) in Nigeria resulted in cVDPV2 detection linked to a previous emergence. The last confirmed case from the 2015-2016 cVDPV type 1 (cVDPV1) outbreak in Laos occurred in January 2016. Up to 14 newly identified persons in 10 countries were found to excrete iVDPVs, and 3 previously reported patients in the United Kingdom and Iran (3) were still excreting type 2 iVDPV (iVDPV2) during the reporting period. Ambiguous VDPVs (aVDPVs), isolates that cannot be classified definitively, were found among immunocompetent persons and environmental samples in 10 countries. Cessation of all OPV use after certification of polio eradication will eliminate the risk for new VDPV infections.

WPV type 2 (WPV2) was last detected in 1999 and global WPV2 eradication was declared in September 2015; WPV type 3 has not been detected since 2012. Since August 2014, residual endemic WPV1 transmission has been detected only in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria, mostly in inaccessible areas. In response to the emergence of multiple cVDPV2 outbreaks, the World Health Organization (WHO) coordinated the synchronized withdrawal of the type 2 component (OPV2; Sabin type 2) from trivalent OPV (tOPV; Sabin types 1, 2, and 3) (4). In April 2016, all OPV-using countries switched to bivalent OPV (bOPV; Sabin types one and 3). Since the switch, the number of isolated Sabin 2 strains from both acute flaccid paralysis and environmental surveillance systems has steadily declined (5). To monitor the disappearance of Sabin 2 strains and to ensure identification of type 2 VDPVs (VDPV2s), as of [1 Aug 2016], all poliovirus type 2 (PV2) isolates are referred for genetic sequencing.

Properties and Virologic Characterization of VDPVs
Poliovirus isolates are grouped into 3 categories: WPV, vaccine-related poliovirus (VRPV), and VDPV. VRPVs have limited divergence in the capsid protein (VP1) nucleotide sequences from the corresponding OPV strain (poliovirus type one and 3 [PV1 and PV3]: less than or equal to one percent divergent; poliovirus type 2: less than or equal to 0.6 percent divergent) (3). VDPVs are greater than one percent divergent (for PV1 and PV3) or greater than 0.6 percent divergent (for PV2) in VP1 nucleotide sequences from the corresponding OPV strain (3). VDPVs are further classified as 1) cVDPVs, when evidence of person-to-person transmission in the community exists; 2) iVDPVs, when they are isolated from persons with PIDs; and 3) aVDPVs, when they are clinical isolates from persons with no known immunodeficiency and no evidence of transmission, or they are sewage isolates that are unrelated to other known VDPVs and whose source is unknown (2). GPEI guidelines about reporting and classification of VDPVs were last updated in August 2016 (http://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Reporting-and-Classification-of-VDPVs_Aug2016_EN.pdf).

Detection of cVDPVs
During January 2016-June 2017, the number of countries with detected cVDPV circulation decreased from 7 to 5 since the previous reporting period (3) (Figure 1 [Vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) detected, by serotype and VDPV classification* -- worldwide, January 2016-June 2017 available at source URL); all except one (cVDPV1 in Laos) reported cVDPV2 circulation (Table). No additional cases have been identified from previously reported VDPV outbreaks in Guinea (cVDPV2), Madagascar (cVDPV1), Myanmar (cVDPV2), Ukraine (cVDPV1), Pakistan (cVDPV2) and Nigeria (cVDPV2). Cases continued to be identified from the previously reported distinct cVDPV2 outbreak in Nigeria (7) and the previously reported cVDPV1 outbreak in Laos (3). New outbreaks were reported in DRC (two cVDPV2 emergences; one with 6 cases and one with 2 cases), Nigeria (cVDPV2, one case), Pakistan (cVDPV2, one case), and Syria (cVDPV2, 35 cases) (Table). Detection of the new cVDPV2 outbreaks occurred after the global tOPV to bOPV switch (April 2016). During January 2016-June 2017, among 48 cVDPV cases, 45 (93%) were cVDPV2 (Table) (Figure 2 [Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) cases detected, by serotype -- worldwide, January 2000-June 2017*,† available at source URL]). Selected cVDPVs from the reporting period are [available at the source URL]

Detection of iVDPVs
During January 2016-June 2017, 17 iVDPV infections were reported from 11 countries (Table), including 14 that were newly detected iVDPV infections. During this reporting period, with the exception of 3 type 3 iVDPVs (iVDPV3), all were type 2. Since introduction of OPV, the cumulative serotype distribution shows that iVDPV2 are the most common (69 percent), followed by type 3 (14 percent) type 1 (12 percent) and heterotypic mixtures (i.e., types 1 and 2 or types 2 and 3) (5 percent). Selected iVDPVs from the reporting period are [available at the source URL]

Detection of aVDPVs
During January 2016-June 2017, aVDPVs were isolated in 11 countries (Table [Vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs) detected, by classification and other selected characteristics - worldwide, January 2016-June 2017, available at source URL). The most divergent aVDPV (2.7 percent VP1 divergence) was isolated from an AFP patient in DRC. This represented an emergence independent of cVDPV2 circulating in the country during the same period. Detection of aVDPVs in settings with less than 60 percent polio vaccination coverage might indicate a risk for cVDPV emergence and further spread as well as potential gaps in surveillance. Selected aVDPVs from the reporting period are [available at the source URL]

Discussion
The number of reported cVDPV outbreaks has decreased from 9 to 7 since the January 2015-May 2016 reporting period (3); however, the total number of reported cVDPV cases in these outbreaks has increased. Control and interruption of cVDPV2 outbreaks in areas at high risk for cVDPV emergence is partly attributable to steadily improving quality of supplementary immunization activities§ and increased access to unimmunized children. For example, the large cVDPV2 outbreaks reported in Nigeria, Chad, and Pakistan during the last 5 years were interrupted; however, residual detection of cVDPV2s at the subnational level is indicative of persistent pockets of underimmunized children in mostly inaccessible areas (7). The new cVDPV2 outbreaks in DRC and Syria highlight the importance of maintaining high levels of poliovirus immunity, as well as sensitive AFP surveillance.

Expanded environmental surveillance in countries at high risk for poliovirus (PV) importation or VDPV emergence has increased the sensitivity of poliovirus detection and has played a critical role in monitoring residual PV2 excretion after OPV2 cessation. Despite the logistical and technical challenges of detecting and sequencing polioviruses from sewage samples, environmental surveillance remains critical in not only increasing the sensitivity of both WPV and VDPV detection, but also accelerating the GPEI response (8).

During the reporting period, VDPV2s were detected both before and after the global withdrawal of OPV2 in April 2016. During the preswitch period (January 2016-April 2016), emergence of cVDPV2 in countries with low routine vaccination coverage underscored the risks of widening immunization gaps to PV2; detection of highly divergent cVDPV2s from sewage samples collected in the state capital adjacent to inaccessible areas of northeast Nigeria also indicated virus circulation that was missed by AFP surveillance. cVDPV2 outbreaks detected after the switch in both Syria and DRC highlighted the risks associated with chronically low tOPV vaccination coverage before the switch. Outbreak response to VDPV2 transmission after OPV2 cessation requires use of mOPV2; the scope and intensity of mOPV2 vaccination campaigns in outbreak areas is assessed by the mOPV2 Advisory Group, which advises the WHO Director General on release of mOPV2. Response to the cVDPV2 outbreak in Syria included 2 mOPV2 mass vaccination campaigns targeting greater than 300 000 children aged less than 5 years, followed by inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) vaccination campaigns targeting greater than 100 000 children aged 2-24 months, including populations at high risk in adjacent areas and countries.

In April 2016, all 155 OPV-using countries and territories switched from tOPV to bOPV; the number of countries reporting PV2 detection decreased 83 percent, from 42 before the switch to 7 after the switch (January-March 2017) (5). The GPEI and Global Polio Laboratory Network have continued to strengthen AFP and poliovirus surveillance. In addition, the increase in the number of environmental surveillance sites has enhanced PV detection (9). Routine immunization services also are being strengthened, and most countries incorporated at least one dose of IPV into routine childhood immunization schedules in 2016. Augmented surveillance for VDPV infections among patients with PID (10) has increased the number of known iVDPV excretors. Continued progress in development of antivirals is needed to eliminate virus shedding in persons with chronic iVDPV infections.

During the last 5 years, the number of WPV cases (greater than 400 in 2013; 12 in 2017) was lower than the estimated number (250-500) of global vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis cases.¶ The ultimate goal of the polio endgame strategic plan is the global cessation of all OPV use after the end of all WPV circulation, which started with cessation of OPV with a type 2 component. Cessation of all OPV use after certification of polio eradication will eliminate the risk for cVDPV outbreaks, and new iVDPV and aVDPV infections.

* As of [15 Sep 2017, one new cVDPV2 was isolated from an AFP case detected in Haut Lomami province with onset date [9 Aug 2017].

† As of [15 Sep 2017], 4 new cVDPV2s were isolated from 4 AFP cases detected in Deir ez-Zor (3 cases) and Homs (1 case) governorates. The total number of AFP cases is 39. The onset date of the latest AFP case was [Thu 13 Jul 2017].

§ Supplementary immunization activities are mass vaccination campaigns conducted in a short period (days to weeks) during which a dose of OPV is administered to all children aged less than 5 years, regardless of previous vaccination history. Campaigns can be conducted nationally or in portions of a country.

¶ Vaccine-associated paralytic polio is a rare (1 in 2.7 million administered doses of OPV) occurrence of paralysis that usually occurs with the 1st OPV dose; no risk for spreading to others exists.

[3] Violence against vaccinators, Pakistan (Sindh) - media report
Date: Tue 31 Oct 2017
Source: GEO news [edited]
https://www.geo.tv/latest/165321-polio-team-assaulted-in-hyderabad-over-vaccine-refusal


Unidentified people assaulted a polio vaccination team in Heerabad Qureshi area of the city on [Tue 31 Oct 2017] after a reported disagreement. The anti-polio team did not have a police escort with it. Following the incident, the vaccination campaign in the area has been suspended for now.

Police officials said the incident was caused after male members of a family began arguing with a polio team that had administered vaccination drops to eligible children. Polio officials claim they had the family's permission to administer the vaccine but were assaulted by the male members as they did not want their children to take the drops.

A total of 3 Levies personnel were injured in an improvised explosive device (IED) blast targeting a polio team in Bajaur Agency's Khar district on [Tue 31 Oct 2017], officials said. Officials in the political administration said the team was targeted while administering polio drops to children in the area. The wounded were shifted to District Headquarters Hospital for treatment, the officials added.

Fieldworkers and security forces involved in anti-polio drives in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have often been targeted by militants.

Pakistan, along with Afghanistan, is one of 2 polio-endemic countries remaining in the world. Militants 1st began targeting polio vaccination teams in Swat in 2007 and then in North and South Waziristan agencies in 2012. The attacks have left children deprived of immunisation, leaving at least 160 crippled by the disease.

[The occurrence of assaults and actual violence through the use of IEDs (improvised explosive devices) in Pakistan and leads to cessation of vaccination activities in the areas until their safety can be assured. It is a very sad state of affairs that children's health and well-being is being held hostage to civil strife in Pakistan. - Mod.MPP
