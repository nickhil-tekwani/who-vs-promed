As the flu season winds down for humans, veterinarians in the Chicago area warn of a deadly outbreak of canine influenza. More than 1000 cases of canine infectious respiratory disease have been reported in recent weeks, with at least 5 dogs dying from the infection.

"It's almost an epidemic," Dr. Jerry Klein told CBS station WBBM-TV. "I've been here for 35 years, it's probably the worst type of outbreak I've ever experienced."

Klein is the supervising veterinarian at the Chicago Veterinary Emergency Center, which has handled about 15 cases of canine flu daily.

"We have had a few fatalities, so that's why it's exceedingly serious," Klein said. "It causes pneumonia, in some cases, and some of these dogs have to be on oxygen and on ventilation."

People cannot get it from their pets, but the illness is extremely contagious between dogs that come into close contact with each other. On Friday, the Cook County Department of Animal and Rabies Control urged pet owners in the area to avoid dog parks, group dog training activities, animal boarding houses and travel.

After several dogs at PetSmart boarding facilities got sick, the company temporarily closed 3 Chicago-area locations to be disinfected. Other groomers and "doggy day care" companies were limiting operations, WBBM reported.

PetSmart spokesman Andy Izquierdo told WBBM 780's Lisa Fielding the company was reminding dog owners about the symptoms, which include a persistent cough, runny nose and fever.

"If they've been in a boarding facility, if they've been at a doggy day camp, or a dog park, that's an area where this virus can be spread," Izquierdo said. "Take a look at your dog, look for signs keep them isolated if at all possible."

Dr. Judith Schwartz, the staff veterinarian at the Humane Society of New York, called the outbreak "very" concerning.

"Especially if it's within a certain period of time," Schwartz told CBS News' Kris Van Kleave. "That's very, very... that's frightening."

Schwartz said treating dog flu can cost thousands of dollars if the animal has to be hospitalized in isolation. An annual vaccine, considered to be highly effective, costs about $100.

"It's (a) concern for me not just because of the animals I see," Schwartz said, "but we could have a dog in the waiting room saying hello to another dog in the waiting room, and they could be incubating -- and no one would know it."

Unlike with human influenza, the number of cases nationwide isn't tracked. Since the condition was 1st discovered in 2004, 40 states have experienced outbreaks. Researchers said 2011 was the worst year on record, with 17 states reporting infections.

Chicago animal control officials said the outbreak could last several more weeks.

[Canine influenza is contagious among dogs but is not transmissible to people. However, owners should be very cautious about letting their dogs be social, whether with the neighbor's dog or at the dog park or dog club or any other canine gathering.

Canine Influenza: Pet Owners' Guide
--------
Canine influenza (CI, or dog flu) in the U.S. is caused by the canine influenza virus (CIV), which is H3N8 influenza A, and was 1st discovered in 2004. Although seasonal flu in people is caused by influenza A viruses, canine influenza virus is a different virus and so far does not infect people. Unlike seasonal flu in people, canine influenza can occur year round. Dogs of any breed, age, sex or health status are at risk of infection when exposed to CIV.

CIV is highly contagious and easily spread from infected dogs to other dogs through direct contact, nasal secretions (through coughing and sneezing), contaminated objects (kennel surfaces, food and water bowls, collars and leashes), and people moving between infected and uninfected dogs. Dogs are most contagious during the 2- to 4-day incubation period for the virus, when they are infected and shedding the virus in their nasal secretions but are not showing signs of illness. Almost all dogs exposed to CIV will become infected, and the majority (80 percent) of infected dogs develop flu-like illness. The mortality (death) rate is low (less than 10 percent).

CIV infection resembles canine infectious tracheobronchitis ("kennel cough"). More common causes of kennel cough include infections are caused by _Bordetella bronchiseptica_/parainfluenza virus complex. The illness may be mild or severe, and infected dogs develop a persistent cough and may develop a thick nasal discharge and fever. Lethargy, nasal or eye discharge, and reduced appetite may also be observed. Most dogs recover within 2-3 weeks. Secondary bacterial infections can develop, and may cause more severe illness and pneumonia.

CIV can be diagnosed early in the illness (less than 4 days) by testing a nasal or throat swab. The most accurate test for CIV infection is a blood test that requires a sample taken during the 1st week of illness, followed by a 2nd sample 10-14 days later.

The spread of CIV can be reduced by isolating ill dogs as well as those who are known to have been exposed to an infected dog and those showing signs of respiratory illness. Good hygiene, such as hand washing and thorough cleaning of shared items and kennels, and good sanitation also reduce the spread of CIV. Influenza viruses do not usually survive in the environment beyond 48 hours and are inactivated or killed by commonly used disinfectants.

There is a vaccine against CIV available for use. The vaccine may not completely prevent infection, but appears to reduce the severity and duration of illness. It also reduces the period of time that an infected dog may shed the virus in its respiratory secretions, as well as the amount of virus shed -- making them less contagious to other dogs. The CIV vaccine is a "lifestyle" vaccine, recommended for dogs at risk of exposure due to their increased exposure to other dogs -- such as boarding, attending social events with dogs present, and visiting dog parks.
