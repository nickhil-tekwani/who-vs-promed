Agriculture ministry scampers to contain foot-and-mouth disease
---------------------------------------------------------------
The government said yesterday [18 Jan 2010] that it will enforce stronger
quarantine measures amidst the latest foot and mouth disease [FMD] outbreak
and take steps to streamline its compensation programs for victimized
farmers. "We are planning to re-examine the affected sites and ensure that
thorough and strengthened quarantine activities take place to remove any
possible dangers; improvements will call for overall systematic reforms,"
vice minister for food, agriculture, forestry and fisheries Ha Young-jae
told reporters.

The official underscored that reforms would be made to reflect the changes
of the times, noting that some farmers have been seeking additional
government compensation, resulting in a slowdown of the culling process.
Seoul said it would fully compensate farmers who have to cull and bury
animals, and would buy the animals from nearby farms that have been barred
from selling animals due to the FMD outbreak.

"Reforms would also call for providing compensation to dairy farmers," the
vice minister said. "We are also seeking to widen the compensation terms
for veterinarians who have been exposed to the disease, as the terms allow
for only about 2 weeks of treatment," he added.

The ministry also underscored the importance of enforcing stronger control
measures for foreigners working in farms. There are currently no
restrictions imposed on foreign workers. "The employing farmer will be
required to register their hired foreign workers to the local governments,
and failure to do so will call for some kind of penalty," Ha said.

Final results on the source of the FMD that was 1st detected on a farm in
Pocheon, Gyeonggi Province, have yet to come out, but the government is not
ruling out the possibility that a source could have been a foreign worker.
Pocheon is located 45 kilometers [28 miles] north of Seoul.

More than 3000 livestock have been destroyed so far, as authorities aim to
contain the spread of the disease. The 2 farms that reported this year the
country's 1st FMD outbreak in 8 years are within a 1 km radius.

A 2nd FMD case was confirmed last Thursday [14 Jan 2010], with the ministry
and National Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service maintaining close
watch on hundreds of farms around the country. The highly contagious animal
disease struck Korea in 2000 and 2002, with 15 and 16 cases reported in
those years, respectively.

FMD affects all hoofed animals such as cattle, hogs, [sheep] and goats. The
disease causes blisters on the feet and mouths of livestock and can cause
death. It can be spread through the air, feed and imported farm products
that have not been sterilized. Humans, though not affected by the disease,
can be carriers, experts say. Ha said it would take at least 3 months [see
comment] for beef and pork exports to see any recovery.

[Korea's timetable for the recovery of its status as "free of FMD", with
the subsequent impact upon exports, is detailed in article 8.5.8. of OIE's
Terrestrial Animal Health Code as follows:

"When an FMD outbreak or FMDV infection occurs in an FMD free country or
zone where vaccination is not practised... the following waiting period
(is) required to regain the status of FMD free country or zone where
vaccination is not practised: 3 months after the last case where a
stamping-out policy and serological surveillance are applied in accordance
with Articles 8.5.40. to 8.5.46." The full text is available at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mcode/en_chapitre_1.8.5.htm>.

The country of origin of the foreign worker, mentioned as a possible
introducer of the virus, will be interesting to note. Mechanical transfer
of the resistant FMD virus on clothing, footwear, etc, has long been known
to occur. One of the published cases was reported from Saskatchewan,
Canada, 1951-1952, where the virus type A was suspected to have reached
Canada in the clothing of an immigrant from West Germany. - Mod.AS
