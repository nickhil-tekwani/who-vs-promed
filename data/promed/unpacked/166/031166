Viet Nam culled a further 500 000 pigs over the past 2 weeks to tackle an outbreak of African swine fever, taking the total killed so far to 1.7 million, or 5 per cent of the country's herd, the agriculture ministry said on [Mon 27 May 2019]. Pork accounts for three quarters of the total meat consumption in Viet Nam, a country of 95 million people where most of its 30 million farm-raised pigs are consumed [by the] domestic [market].

The virus, first detected in the South East Asian country in February [2019], has spread to 42 of the country's 63 provinces, the agriculture ministry's Livestock Production Department said in a statement on its website. "The African swine fever outbreak is the most dangerous and costly of its kind in the husbandry industry of Viet Nam," agriculture minister Nguyen Xuan Cuong said in the statement. "Though the virus first appeared nearly 100 years ago, there has been no vaccine and no medicine for treating the disease."

China, the world's largest pork producer, which has also been hit by the virus, said on [Fri 24 May 2019] it will start work on clinical trials of a vaccine for African swine fever.

Cuong said it is difficult to contain the outbreak given that the virus remains dormant in the environment for a long time and can spread through complex and varied means. Earlier this month [May 2019], Viet Nam said it would mobilize its military and police forces to help combat the outbreak. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in March [2019] advised Viet Nam to declare the swine fever outbreak a national emergency.

[According to another media source (https://www.smh.com.au/world/asia/vietnam-culls-1-7-million-pigs-as-swine-fever-spreads-20190527-p51rmo.html), the rainy season and subsequent flooding in the south western region of the Mekong Delta has exacerbated the spread of the disease and affected the burial of culled animals. Even in areas where there have been no new cases for at least 30 days, outbreaks may recur. The government said it has received feedback on a higher compensation rate for affected farmers. The current rate of 38 000 dong (USD 1.62) per kilogram for live hogs is prompting farmers to hide or delay reports of infections. They also try to sell infected animals. In Dong Nai province, known as the "pig capital" of Viet Nam, authorities will prosecute farmers who had fought against the culling of their sickened pigs. Slaughtering infected pigs for meat is still occurring there, the government said.

FAO's recent weekly ASF/Asia update (dated 23 May 2019) provides additional information on the ASF situation in Viet Nam, including the following new actions undertaken. Viet-Nam's prime minister released a directive (no. 4291/VPCP-NN, 17 May 2019) assigning the deputy prime minister Mr Trinh Dinh Dung to lead the ASF prevention and control. The directive asked all levels of the government to review ASF response plans, and nominated chair persons of the People's Committees at different levels to monitor the plan implementation. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) assume the prime responsibility: in coordinating urgent review of legal documents; in developing conditions for animal husbandry, slaughtering, and consumption of pork products, and urging localities to restructure the livestock industry and to diversify livestock production such as, cattle, poultry, and aquatic animals in the immediate future to compensate for the shortage of pork products. MARD and the Ministry of Science and Technology are to carry out research on ASF vaccines. MARD and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) are to approach international organizations and countries to consider support for Viet Nam, and to promptly share information on the outbreak situation. The directive also nominated the Ministry of Industry and Trade to promote purchasing uninfected pigs in the ASF infected areas in order to minimize the spread, to keep stable prices, to have clean food sources to meet market demand, and to strengthen market inspection to prevent trade/transport of pigs and pig products of unknown origin. The Ministry of Finance is to coordinate the use of state budget, and the Ministry of Information and Communications to instruct media agencies to keep timely and accurate information.

On 20 May 2019, the Central Committee of the Communist Party issued the Directive no. 34-CT/TW, directing all levels to strengthen their leadership and operational instructions for effective implementation of ASF response, control, and prevention. One of the directive's priorities is setting criteria to restore pig farms after an outbreak, to strengthen the veterinary system and its capacity to carry out the tasks and to strengthen inspection. It designated the leaders of Communist Party Committees/organizations/authorities at all levels accountable.
