A 4th stallion in Wisconsin has tested positive for contagious equine
metritis, or CEM, a treatable reproductive disease of horses. One
mare has also tested positive in the state. Nationwide, 12 stallions
and 3 mares have been found to be infected.

The National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa, reported
the positive test result earlier this week. The stallion, a
26-year-old saddlebred housed in Winnebago County, has been
quarantined. Like the 3 stallions that tested positive previously,
this one was exposed to the bacterial infection at an artificial
insemination center. However, he was not exposed to the Outagamie
County stallion that was the first to test positive in Wisconsin.

"While the source of the outbreak is still not known, some have
presumed that Nanning, the 1st CEM-positive stallion we reported in
Wisconsin, was the original source. This result makes it clear that
he was not," said Wisconsin State Veterinarian Dr Robert Ehlenfeldt.
"This latest infection dates to 2006 and possibly 2005. The 1st
CEM-positive stallion we reported was infected in a different
insemination facility, and he was infected in 2007 or later, our
investigation shows."

State and federal animal health personnel have conducted the
investigation by examining the breeding records and movement history
of each infected horse to find other exposed animals. At each step,
any exposed animals are quarantined, tested, and treated. Owners of
exposed animals are contacted by state or federal animal health
officials. There is no need for them to have their animals tested if
they have not been contacted.

There is no human health risk and no risk to horses in the general population.

The outbreak began in mid-December [2008], when a quarter horse
stallion on a Kentucky farm tested positive during routine testing
for international semen shipment. Kentucky recently imposed stringent
testing requirements for Wisconsin stallions imported for breeding.
The investigation now involves at least 608 horses in 45 states,
according to the US Department of Agriculture.

CEM is a contagious bacterial infection that passes between mares and
stallions during mating. It can also be transmitted on contaminated
insemination equipment. Stallions do not suffer any symptoms, but the
infection causes inflammation in the mare's uterine lining. This may
prevent pregnancy or cause the mare to abort if she becomes pregnant.
The disease is treatable with disinfectants and antibiotics.

CEM is considered a foreign animal disease in the United States. It
was first discovered in Europe in 1977, and has appeared in the
United States only twice outside quarantine stations where stallions
are required to be tested and treated before being released into the
country. In 1979, there was an outbreak. In 2006, 3 Lipizzaner
stallions imported into Wisconsin from Eastern Europe tested positive
after their arrival, but before they had been used for breeding.
