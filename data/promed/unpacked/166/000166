At least 170 people took ill due to suspected food poisoning in Kothwan village in Munger district of Bihar late on Monday [5 Jul 2021]. Sources in the district administration said more than 250 people were invited to a home for Satyanarayan Katha late that evening. After consuming the prasad, most of the villagers complained of an upset stomach, dizziness and vomiting. As the number grew, the district administration alerted the civil surgeon, who sent a team comprising 2 doctors, 6 paramedical staff and 3 ambulances to attend to the patients at around 11pm.

Munger district magistrate Navin Kumar said most of those who took ill were fine after being given medication. Dr NK Mehta, who treated the villagers, said of the 170 people 80 are still under treatment and everyone was out of danger. Civil surgeon Dr Harendra Kumar Alok said 15 persons were admitted to the nearby community health centre (Dharhara) as a precautionary measure as they showed symptoms of dehydration. "It was only a preventive move and all of them are recovering fast. All of them will be discharged by Tuesday evening [6 Jul 2021]," he said.

Citing police and health department officials, Dr Alok said the charnamrit [prasad comprising milk] served after the Katha could have been contaminated, leading to the illness. Samples of the prasad were seized and sent to the laboratory for examination, he added.

[A non-febrile illness primarily with vomiting is suggestive of staphylococcal enterotoxin-associated illness where foods are not adequately handled and _Staphylococcus aureus_ is allowed to grow and produce toxin. A toxin dose of less than 1.0 microgram in contaminated food will produce symptoms of staphylococcal intoxication. This toxin level is reached when _S. aureus_ populations exceed 100 000 per gram.

Foods that are frequently incriminated in staphylococcal food poisoning include meat and meat products; poultry and egg products; salads such as egg, tuna, chicken, potato, and macaroni; bakery products such as cream-filled pastries, cream pies, and chocolate eclairs; sandwich fillings; and milk and dairy products. Foods that require considerable handling during preparation, and that are kept at slightly elevated temperatures after preparation, are frequently involved in staphylococcal food poisoning.

A very short incubation of a vomiting-associated illness (less than one hour) also suggests that the etiology might have been heavy metal ingestion. A number of metals can cause this type of syndrome, which is usually caused by the ingestion of a liquid that had been kept in a metallic container. These metals include antimony, copper, tin, and zinc. The illnesses are usually self-limiting and require only symptomatic care. In addition to vomiting, other clues may include the liquid being described as having a metallic taste. Identifying the specific cause requires analysis of the food or liquid vehicle. Some potential differences in the illnesses exist between causes, including a longer incubation period (several hours) for zinc; vomiting and diarrhea for tin; and blue or green vomitus for copper. Other chemical toxins can also produce this syndrome of illness.

Satyanarayan Katha is a holiday story for the worship of the Hindu god Vishnu. Prasad, or offering, (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyanarayan_Puja) also called Sapatha, Sheera or Sapaada Bhakshya), is prepared with equal parts (usually one and one-fourth parts) of sugar, semolina, and ghee (clarified butter). Popularly, it is cooked to blanch. Cardamoms, cashews, raisins, and/or bananas may be added while cooking or as garnishing. Some people avoid cooking and merely mix the ingredients together. The prasad is offered together with daily food, various fruits, and panchamrutam (an uncooked mixture of milk, yogurt, ghee, honey, and sugar).

Bihar (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar) is a state in eastern India. It is the 3rd-largest state by population and 12th-largest by territory, with an area of 94 163 sq km (36 357 sq mi). It is contiguous with Uttar Pradesh to its west, Nepal to the north, the northern part of West Bengal to the east, and with Jharkhand to the south. The Bihar plain is split by the river Ganges, which flows from west to east. Its location in the country can be found at the URL above. - Mod.LL
