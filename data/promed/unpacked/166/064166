A life threatening typhoid outbreak has been reported in Harare's Dzivaresekwa high-density suburb and surrounding areas, about 10 km from the capital city. An alert was sent out last night [4 Dec 2012] through the Harare Residents Trust issuing caution to people in the area. It is reported that school children at Nhamburiko Primary School have recorded the highest figures of affected people to date.

Harare city council authorities have been blamed for the outbreak due to council's failure to provide clean water supplies to residents. The capital is not new to the bacteria [_Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi], and earlier this year [2012], environmental scientists revealed that many water sources across the city have been affected due to sewer spillage.

One Hararian protested against the mayor: "The Mayor looks down upon the poor and the marginalised. He thinks they are lazy and do not want to develop. But give him an opportunity, [and] he is convincing in his presentations but lacks on delivery and relevance to the citizenry."

A statement by the Harare Residents Trust reads: "Alert: There has been a typhoid outbreak in Dzivarasekwa. The local clinic has transferred about 15-16 people to Beatrice Infectious [Diseases] Hospital every day since last week. The most affected are the pupils at Nhamburiko Primary School. Harare City Council's failure to provide clean water to the residents is compounding the situation!"

Presidential Health consultant Dr Timothy Stamps has provided guidance on identifying typhoid as follows:

Typhoid is especially an urban disease. The diagnosis can only be made definitely by either a blood culture (which indicates that the infectious organism has gotten into the blood system) or by rectal swab/faecal culture of the causative organism. Indirect methods such as the Widal titre (O and H antigens) are of limited value, especially as an outbreak progresses.

The classical picture of typhoid fever is a temperature which is intermittent for the 1st week or so of the illness, then becoming persistent and sometimes very high, coupled with vague symptoms such as headache, weakness, sore joints, abdominal pains (especially in the appendix area), and constipation (kufufutirwa) rather than diarrhoea (manyoka).

Most typhoid sufferers react badly to aspirin, headache pills, or powders and in a generalised outbreak should be restricted.

Rose spots, which disappear on pressure, occur on the chest and upper abdomen in the 1st week of the disease; they are not easy to detect in most Zimbabweans.

Zimbabwe's capital city remains on high alert because of the ongoing spread of typhoid, with at least 5 related deaths registered in Harare since October 2012.

These latest deaths have been recorded mainly in the Glenview suburb where a fresh outbreak was reported in October 2012, a year since the 1st outbreak in Harare in 2011. Residents in Dzivarasekwa have also been warned about an outbreak of the disease there, where the local clinic has been transferring about 15-16 people to Beatrice Infectious [Diseases] Hospital every day since last week. According to a local residents association, the main bulk of the patients have been pupils from Nhamburiko Primary School.

Harare City Health Deputy Director Dr Prosper Chonzi said other new cases have also been reported in Mabvuku, Tafara, and other suburbs that have no access to clean water. "The fight against typhoid, which began in the city last year [2011], is far from over, as we continue to record fresh outbreaks," he said.

Typhoid cases have been reported in different parts of Zimbabwe since last year [2011], with the worst affected areas being the densely populated suburbs around Harare's centre, including Kuwadzana and Mufakose. More cases have been reported throughout the year in Bindura, Mashonaland Central, and Norton and Zvimba in Mashonaland West. Chitungwiza and Kadoma have also reported serious outbreaks, with the local authorities being blamed for failing to provide clean water.

The latest outbreak in and around Harare brings the number of suspected cases registered across the country to about 5000. In February this year [2012], the Health Ministry admitted it was not on top of the situation, with a critical lack of medicine and clean water hampering treatment and prevention efforts. Many local councils too have been unable to provide proper sanitation to their residents, blaming broken down sewerage systems and water pipes for this failure.

Dr. Rutendo Bonde, the chairperson of the Zimbabwe Doctors for Human Rights, told SW Radio Africa on Friday [7 Dec 2012] that until there are lasting measures to combat water shortages, [effective] water provision, and sewage maintenance, diseases like typhoid will continue to be a threat.

Bonde, meanwhile, said that there are basic measures of prevention that can be adopted if possible, including following simple sanitation routines. She said measures like hand washing are critical to stop the disease from spreading further.

[The densely populated suburbs around Harare have continued to suffer an ongoing outbreak of typhoid fever since October 2011. As of 2 May 2012, a total of 4185 suspected cases of typhoid fever had been identified in Harare (see ProMED-mail post Typhoid fever update 2012 (11): Zimbabwe (Harare) 20120614.1168345). The latest outbreak in and around Harare brings the total number of suspected cases reported to about 5000, with at least 5 related deaths since October 2012.

An investigative team from the U.S. CDC, in collaboration with Zimbabwe government officials, attributed this outbreak to fecal contamination of drinking water in the overcrowded residential suburbs of Harare, where rural-to-urban migration has outpaced maintenance and expansion of water supply and sewerage infrastructure (CDC. MMWR. Notes from the Field: _Salmonella Typhi_ Infections Associated with Contaminated Water -- Zimbabwe, October 2011-May 2012 Weekly June 15, 2012 / 61(23);435-435. Available at: http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6123a3.htm?s_cid=mm6123a3_e).

Harare is the largest city and capital of Zimbabwe and has an estimated population of 1 606 000 (2009), with 2 800 000 in its metropolitan area (2006) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harare). Numerous suburbs surround the city. The northern and northeastern suburbs of Harare are home to the more affluent population of the city. Glenview is in the southern suburbs, and Dzivaresekwa is in the western suburbs (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harare#Suburbs).
