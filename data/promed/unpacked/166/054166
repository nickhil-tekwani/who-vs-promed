CDC is only reporting ill people that have been confirmed by PulseNet as being infected with the outbreak strain of Shiga toxin-producing, enterohemorrhagic _Escherichia coli_ O26 (EHEC O26). 45 people infected with the outbreak strain of EHEC O26 have been reported from 6 states. The majority of illnesses have been reported from Washington and Oregon. The number of ill people reported from each state is as follows: California (2), Minnesota (2), New York (1), Ohio (1), Oregon (13), and Washington (26).

Among people for whom information is available, illnesses started on dates ranging from 19 Oct 2015 to 8 Nov 2015. Ill people range in age from 2 years to 94, with a median age of 22. 58 percent of ill people are female. 16 (36 percent) people reported being hospitalized. There have been no reports of hemolytic uremic syndrome and no deaths.

CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill persons and to interview them.

Investigation Update
----------------
CDC, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and public health officials in several states are investigating an outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ O26 infections.

The epidemiologic evidence available to investigators at this time suggests that a meal item or ingredient served at Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurants in several states is a likely source of this outbreak. The investigation has not identified what specific food is linked to illness. Chipotle Mexican Grill is assisting public health officials with understanding the distribution of food items served at locations where ill people ate, and this work is ongoing.

State and local public health officials are interviewing ill people to obtain information about foods they might have eaten and other exposures in the week before their illness started. 43 (96 percent) of 45 people interviewed reported eating at a Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurant. The investigation is ongoing to identify common meal items or ingredients causing illness.

Investigators are also using whole genome sequencing, an advanced laboratory technique, to get more information about the DNA fingerprint of the EHEC O26 bacteria causing illness. To date, whole genome sequencing has been performed on EHEC O26 isolates from 9 ill people in Washington and 1 ill person in Minnesota. All 10 isolates were highly related genetically to one another. This provides additional evidence that illnesses outside the Pacific Northwest are related to the illnesses in Oregon and Washington.

Updates will be provided when more information is available.

[Prior to this update, there had only been 1 genetically identical isolate outside Washington and Oregon, which was in Minnesota, and that case had not eaten at a Chipotle restaurant. Although not genetically confirmed as yet, 5 additional cases of O26 have been diagnosed in the Pacific Northwest states of Washington and Oregon. In analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups, it has been found that they belong to their own lineages and have unique profiles of virulence traits different from O157 (1). The serogroups appearing to be most prominent are O26, O111, O128, and O103 (2), the former serotype being the implicated strain in this outbreak.

If a laboratory is using sorbitol-MacConkey (sMAC) plates to identify EHEC by virtue of O157's inability to ferment sorbitol, the non-O157 strains will be missed. In a 3-year pediatric study from the University of Washington, USA (3), 1851 stool samples were processed for sorbitol fermentation as well as toxin production by EIA (enzyme immunoassay), and 28 strains of O157 were found along with O103 (4 strains), O118 (2 strains), O111 (2 strains), and 3 other strains.

Clinically, the O157 infections had a higher frequency of bloody stools, fecal leukocytes, and abdominal pain with shorter symptom duration. Five (18 per cent) of O157 infections developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS); none of the non-O157 strains did. Since toxin assay did not identify all O157 strains found on sMAC plates, the investigators did not advocate performing toxin assay alone. Non-O157 can produce HUS, as demonstrated by a cluster of O121 cases associated with a lake in Connecticut, USA (4).

Since toxin assays are not uniformly performed in many areas, and most cases do not produce HUS, it is likely that cases due to non-O157 strains are being missed. How frequent this phenomenon will become over time is unclear.
