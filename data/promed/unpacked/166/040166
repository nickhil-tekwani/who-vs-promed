A bacterium affecting Maine seed potatoes could pose big problems. Scientists at the Maine Department of Agriculture [MDA] are consulting with European researchers who have a longer history with the bacterium known as _Dickeya dianthicola_, commonly known as blackleg.

The Maine Potato Board say the problem 1st surfaced when farmers who sell seed potatoes to out-of-state growers began hearing complaints that [there was] a blackleg problem. Some of the growers lost up to half of the crops. The seed potatoes appeared fine when they left Maine.

Ann Gibbs, MDA, is working with the state's potato industry to create new forms of testing to identify the presence of the bacteria. A new rule regulating the seed certification program is being finalized. The Maine Potato Board will have to wait until later this year [2016] to determine the effect that _Dickeya_ is having on Maine's seed potato industry.

[Blackleg of potato can be caused by several species and subspecies of bacteria in the genera _Pectobacterium_ and _Dickeya_. Symptoms may include stem rot leading to leaf yellowing, wilting and stunting of plants, as well as tuber rot, which usually starts at the stem end of the tuber.

The bacteria are spread with contaminated plant or other material (including seed tubers), by mechanical means, and water. Disease management may include seed tuber handling and cultural techniques, use of clean planting material and phytosanitation to prevent introduction of the pathogen from external sources. Low levels of seed tuber infection pose a major risk of pathogen spread, and certification schemes are a vital part of disease management for these pathogens.

_P. atrosepticum_ (previously _Erwinia carotovora_ subsp. _atroseptica_) was considered to be the main blackleg pathogen in Europe, until the emergence of the more virulent new species _Dickeya solani_ (ProMED-mail post 20091207.4162). _P. wasabiae_ and _D. dianthicola_ are also known to cause the disease in Europe. _P. carotovorum_ subsp. _brasiliensis_ (Pcb) has been reported as a causal agent from a number of countries in the Americas and other parts of the world.

_D. dianthicola_ has been known to be present in the US on ornamentals but has only recently been observed on potato. It is not clear whether this is due to a new pathogen strain with extended host range. _D. solani_, which currently causes large crop losses in Europe, has not yet been detected in the Americas. _D. dianthicola_ blackleg has been reported in several US states as well as Ontario province in Canada and is now considered an emerging disease in North America.

Population shifts of plant pathogens are being observed with increasing frequency. Climate changes and selection pressure due to intensified agriculture are thought to be among the possible reasons. For example, the main blackleg pathogen in the Netherlands shifted from a predominant _D. solani_ before 2014 to Pcb being responsible for almost 70 per cent of cases within just a few years (ProMED-mail post 20160128.3974722). It remains to be seen whether, similarly, _D. dianthicola_ will now become the predominant blackleg pathogen in North America.

_Pectobacterium_ and _Dickeya_ species or subspecies also cause bacterial soft rot of potato. The pathogens can also affect other crops, causing, for example, a foot rot disease in rice as well as stem and root rot of sweet potato.
