At least 28 children have died in the last one month in Muzaffarpur district of north Bihar, allegedly due to AES, which is locally known as Chamki bukhar (brain fever).

Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, has expressed concern over the rising deaths of children in Muzaffarpur. He said, "A team of doctors and medical experts have been sent to Muzaffarpur to monitor the situation and also speed up the awareness drive about complexities and preventive measures about AES."

"Till last night [10 Jun 2019], 28 children have lost their lives... we've started 2 separate intensive care units (ICU) along with other makeshift wards in the government hospital", Muzaffarpur civil surgeon Dr Shailendera Prasad Singh told The Hindu over phone.

Earlier on [Mon 10 Jun 2019], Principal Secretary of the Health Department Sanajy Kumar said the deaths were caused by hypoglycemia (deficiency of glucose or sugar in the blood stream), and not by the fever. He, however, added that "48 suspected AES cases have been recorded so far in the district."

On [Tue 11 Jun 2019] Union Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare Ashwani Kumar Choubey said in Patna that "since state government officials were engaged in election-related works in the recent past months they could not make the awareness drive as it should have been... we're careful and taking all measures to tackle the situation of death of children in Muzaffarpur."

Meanwhile, unofficial records said that 130 cases of suspected AES had come in at the Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) and private Kejriwal hospital in Muzaffarpur in the last 9 days. "Totally, 81 children with suspected AES are admitted in these 2 hospitals and over 3 dozen have already died... these days the ICUs, pediatrics ICU and other makeshift separate wards of SKMCH and Kejriwal hospital are crammed with children having symptoms of suspected AES...if not contained soon, the death toll may go up to 50 in the coming days", said a doctor of the SKMCH on the condition of anonymity.

Every year during summer time, especially in the season of luscious fruit litchi, AES outbreak gets reported and takes the lives of children in the district, which is India's largest litchi cultivation region. In 2014, when altogether 90 children died in the district due to suspected AES, a research carried by the Lancet Global Health established the connection between litchi consumption and encephalitis deaths.

Mr Nitish Kumar had said, "It generally hits those children who go to sleep empty stomach at night and eat litchis fallen on the ground. Earlier, 3 different teams of doctors had reached 3 different conclusions about the reason of children's deaths in summer season in Muzaffarpur... last year [2018], very few deaths were reported because an extensive awareness drive was launched."

Former Union Health Minister Dr Harshvardhan had visited the SKMCH and made several announcements, including the setting up of a virology lab at the hospital to study the nature of diseases, but nothing happened thereafter.

According to doctors, high temperatures during summer, along with humidity more than the normal, is considered to be an ideal situation for the outbreak of AES, which has symptoms of high fever, vomiting, nausea and unconsciousness. Since 2010, 398 children have died in Muzaffarpur due to suspected AES.

[The etiology of the cases is not confirmed, but the majority are reported as hypoglycemic and lychee fruit consumption is implicated. As noted previously, frequently some cases of AES are attributed to Japanese encephalitis but many are of undefined etiology. The determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. Various etiological agents have been proposed in recent years as responsible for AES cases. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 most common agents identified in acute encephalitis syndrome (AES), but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue.

It has been proposed previously that consumption of lychees is responsible for some encephalitis cases. Encephalopathy and hypoglycemia have been associated with consumption of lychee fruit containing phytotoxins, specifically alpha-(methylenecyclopropyl)glycine (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150201.3132842). However, Dr Jacob John has asserted that many of these are hypoglycemic Reye syndrome cases. He noted that in the pre-monsoon period, particularly in May and June, outbreaks of Reye-like acute hypoglycemic encephalopathy occur in the north western region of Bihar state and that is also popularly, but unfortunately, called AES. Many doctors, the media, and the public consider these encephalopathy cases as encephalitis because of the term AES. This has been now clarified and in June 2014 children were treated by 10 per cent dextrose infusion and many lives were saved. Other etiologies have been proposed by clinicians. A published article in a pediatric journal proposed that some cases are due to heat stroke.
