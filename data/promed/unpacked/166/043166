Cohort study of a campylobacteriosis outbreak associated with chicken
liver parfait, UK, June 2010

Campylobacteriosis is an acute bacterial enteric disease, caused by
infection with _Campylobacter_. Common symptoms include diarrhoea,
abdominal pain, malaise, fever, nausea, and/or vomiting (1) and may
persist for a week or even longer (2). Onset is usually between 2 and
5 days after exposure, but may be up to 10 days. The infectious dose
required to cause campylobacteriosis is estimated to be as low as 500
organisms (3). _Campylobacter_ infection continues to be the most
commonly reported cause of foodborne illness in England and Wales,
with 57 772 laboratory reports of cases received by the Health
Protection Agency (HPA) in 2009 (4).

Despite the high incidence of this disease, the HPA received only 114
reports of foodborne campylobacterosis outbreaks between 1992 and
2009, of which 25 (22 percent) were recorded as being linked to
consumption of poultry liver dishes (5). Chicken liver foods carry a
high risk of _Campylobacter_ infection as the bacteria can infect
both the external and internal tissue of chicken livers (6), and may
remain in chicken liver if insufficiently cooked (7). The association
between poultry liver dishes and outbreaks of _Campylobacter_
infection has been illustrated by 2 recently published studies from
Scotland (8,9).

On 5 Jul 2010, a suspected outbreak of campylobacteriosis was
reported to the North East Health Protection Unit (HPU) by
Environmental Health Officers from Northumberland County Council.
Reports of illness were received from guests at a wedding held at a
luxury hotel in Northumberland on 25 Jun 2010. One guest was
hospitalized with campylobacteriosis following the event. In total,
13 guests who ate at the event submitted samples that tested positive
for _Campylobacter_. The event consisted of a wedding breakfast
(afternoon meal) and an evening buffet.

At the 1st Outbreak Control Team meeting on 7 Jul 2010, the decision
was made to undertake an analytical study. Reports of illness were
only received from guests who had attended the wedding breakfast, and
accordingly the study was carried out on this group.

Method
Study design and cohort
-----------------------
A retrospective cohort study was used. The cohort was defined as
persons who had eaten the wedding breakfast at the luxury hotel on 25
Jun 2010 (n=67). Contact details for these 67 guests were obtained
from the event organizer. The evening buffet was excluded because no
cases were reported in guests attending only the evening buffet. All
reported cases attended the wedding breakfast (3 of them attended
only the wedding breakfast).

Data collection
---------------
Of the 67 guests listed by the event organizer, 65 were posted a
questionnaire with a covering letter and a stamped and addressed
return envelope. The remaining 2 guests, resident outside the United
Kingdom (UK), were sent an electronic copy of the covering letter and
questionnaire via email in order to maintain the timeliness of the
investigation. One week after the 1st posting, a follow-up letter was
sent to those guests whose questionnaires were still to be received.

Case definition
---------------
Cases were defined as persons who attended the wedding at the hotel
on 25 Jun 2010, who reported an illness with diarrhoea or vomiting,
with or without other gastrointestinal symptoms, and with an onset of
illness between 26 Jun 2010 and 5 Jul 2010. Guests with illness onset
dates less than 1 day or greater than 10 days after the event were
included as non-cases.

Response rate
-------------
Of the 67 persons on the guest list, 2 were found to be infants who
did not eat the wedding breakfast and were excluded from the study,
giving a potential cohort size of 65. Completed questionnaires were
received from 60 of 65 remaining guests (92 percent).

Questionnaire content
---------------------
The questionnaire contained questions regarding personal details,
illness information, travel history, other illness in the household,
food and drink consumed at the meal, in addition to other questions
relating to the participant's stay at the hotel. The menu for the
wedding breakfast was obtained from the hotel; details from this menu
were used to inform the content of the questionnaire.

Statistical analyses
--------------------
Data were double-entered using EpiData v3.1 (EpiData Association) and
then verified and analysed using STATA 10.1 (StataCorp). The
association between exposure variables and illness was examined using
univariate, stratified methods (using Mantel-Haenszel risk ratios and
the Woolf test for homogeneity), and multivariable methods (logistic
and binary regression).

Results
Descriptive epidemiology
------------------------
Of the 60 individuals included in the study, 24 fitted the case
definition. Of these 24, 13 received laboratory confirmation of
campylobacteriosis. Illness onset dates for cases ranged from 26 to
30 Jun 2010 (Figure 1; [for figures and tables, see the source URL
above - Mod.LL]). The incubation period ranged from 1 to 5 days
(mean=2.25 days). The symptoms experienced by cases are shown in
Table 1; duration of symptoms ranged from 1 to 18 days. A mean
duration of symptoms cannot be calculated as 13 of 24 cases were
still experiencing symptoms when answering the questionnaire.

There was no significant difference in age (Student's t-test, p=
0.94), or gender (chi-square test, p=0.46) between cases and
non-cases (Table 1).

Analytical epidemiology
-----------------------
In a univariate analysis, the strength of association between the
risk of becoming a case and 40 exposures was calculated. Of these, 4
exposures were significantly (p less than 0.05) associated with
illness; these are shown in Table 2. From this univariate analysis,
chicken liver parfait was the variable most strongly associated with
illness, with a risk ratio (RR) of 30.08.

Of variables significantly associated with illness, chicken liver
parfait, onion marmalade, and the mixed leaf salad were served in the
same set dish. While cheesecake is positively associated with
illness, it only explains 14 of the 24 cases, whereas chicken liver
parfait explains 23 of the 24 cases. To examine potential confounding
and effect modification between variables, significant exposures (p
less than 0.05) were stratified for exposure to chicken liver parfait
and Mantel-Haenszel RRs calculated (Table 3). Consumption of chicken
liver parfait strongly confounded each of these variables, and after
stratification the association between these exposures and illness
was no longer significant.

As the results of the multivariable model show (Table 4), when
adjusting for other significant exposures, chicken liver parfait
(RR=27.8, 95 percent CI: 3.9-199.7) remained significantly associated
with illness.

Microbiology
------------
Due to the time between the event and notification of the outbreak
(10 days), no samples of food from the wedding remained for
microbiological analysis. However, environmental samples from the
kitchen were taken. Based on results from these environmental
samples, the general hygiene of the premises was determined to be satisfactory.

Discussion
----------
These results show a very strong association between consumption of
chicken liver parfait at the wedding breakfast and
campylobacteriosis. The multivariable analysis of food items
demonstrates that even after adjusting for confounding variables,
guests who ate chicken liver parfait had a risk of illness that was
28 times greater than guests who did not eat this food.

An investigation by Environmental Health Officers identified concerns
about the method used to prepare the chicken liver parfait for this
event. Information from the hotel indicates that after mixing raw
chicken livers with a red wine reduction and raw eggs, the parfait
mixture was heated, using a 'bain marie' (water bath), to a core
temperature of 65 deg C [149 deg F] and then immediately removed from
the oven and cooled for 15 minutes. According to the UK Food
Standards Agency advice, if liver is cooked at 65 deg C, it should be
held at this temperature for at least 10 minutes to ensure adequate
cooking (10).

One of the most positive elements in the implementation of this study
was the high response rate (92 percent) to the postal questionnaire.
This may have been due to factors such as the prompt posting of the
questionnaire after the wedding, the type of event concerned, and the
high proportion of guests reporting illness. Other factors, such as
the relatively short length of questionnaire, the inclusion of a
personalised letter, 1st class postage, the inclusion of a stamped
and addressed return envelope, and follow up contact of
non-respondents, have all been previously associated with increasing
response rates to postal questionnaires (11).

It is possible that the study was affected by an ascertainment bias,
in that the suggestion that chicken liver parfait had caused the
outbreak may have circulated among guests, biasing their responses in
the questionnaire. However, the number of portions recorded as having
been eaten in the questionnaires was similar to the hotel's estimate
of portions served, suggesting that the effect of this bias was
inconsequential. Also, the case definition was such that guests
reporting diarrhoea or vomiting, independent of other symptoms, were
included as cases. This may have led to the misclassification of
non-cases as cases, reducing the strength of observed associations.

The outbreak investigation was conducted in a timely fashion, which
minimised recall bias in questionnaire responses and enabled prompt
implementation of control measures. As a result of this outbreak
investigation, the hotel, one of a group of 6, reviewed their
catering operations, removing certain high risk foods from their
menus and implementing quarterly unannounced kitchen inspections.

Of the 25 foodborne _Campylobacter_ outbreaks linked to chicken liver
parfait/pate reported to the HPA between 1992 and 2009, 17 were
recorded to have been due to errors in food handling during
preparation of the chicken liver dishes. These food handling errors
included inadequate cooking of blended livers in a bain marie (5).

From 2007 to 2009, the proportion of foodborne _Campylobacter_
outbreaks in England and Wales that were linked with chicken liver
dishes increased significantly (12), indicating that the consumption
of this food is a public health issue of escalating importance.

From the evidence available, it is likely that the cooking method
used for the chicken liver parfait was insufficient to ensure that
the food was free from _Campylobacter_ bacteria. These findings
demonstrate the importance of influencing catering practice with
regard to the cooking of chicken livers, to reduce the risk of
campylobacteriosis outbreaks.

[It is apparent that undercooked chicken livers especially as a
parfait can transmit _Campylobacter_. Bacterial hepatitis in birds
due to _Campylobacter_ has been reported (1) but there are generally
higher titers of the bacterium on the hepatic surface than internally
(2) which suggests carry-over from surface contamination in many
cases. Much chicken liver contamination may occur due to
post-slaughter handling. - Mod.LL]
