Bovine tuberculosis is a notifiable animal disease that can also be transmitted to humans and pets (for example, if products are eaten raw). For years there have only been isolated cases of the disease in Germany but is now in the Wartburg district.

In Thuringia there is a case of bovine tuberculosis. According to the Ministry of Health, an animal owner in the Wartburg district is affected. The disease was officially diagnosed in one of his cattle after slaughter.

In the slaughterhouse, it was noticed that the lymph nodes in the cattle had changed noticeably. According to the ministry, an analysis of organ samples sent in showed that the animal was infected with tuberculosis bacteria. Now the entire livestock of the company should be examined. If further infections are found, the cattle would have to be killed.

Bovine tuberculosis is a notifiable animal disease that is caused by mycobacteria and has a chronic course. It is one of the so-called zoonoses. This refers to diseases that can also be transmitted to humans and pets.

Bovine tuberculosis can cause tuberculosis in humans. According to the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR), transmission to humans, for example through the consumption of milk or meat, is possible if the products are consumed raw.

Germany has been free of bovine tuberculosis since 1997. Nevertheless, isolated cases do occur.

[Re slide 2: The EC legislation referred to is "Delegated regulation 2020/689 - Supplement to Regulation 2016/429 as regards rules for surveillance, eradication programmes, and disease-free status for certain listed and emerging diseases," which had been published on 3 Jun 2020 and entered into force on 23 Jun 2020; available at https://tinyurl.com/2mpbv6kv.

From both items above, combined, the following may be deduced at this stage:

1. The affected establishment in Thuringia (central Germany) is a large dairy operation, maintaining 3245 bovine animals, of which some 1300 are milking cows. The animals are kept in 3 different epidemiological units, some kilometers apart.

2. The discovery of the 1st case took place during a meat-inspection procedure applied after slaughter in a slaughterhouse; the typical lesions, later confirmed in the lab, were "noticeable," which may be indicative of a considerable period of time since its infection and of its potential to have become infective. No data on the age or gender of the animal has become publicly available.

3. At least 3 additional animals have reacted positive to the tuberculine test, followed by their sanitary slaughter and, most likely, submission of samples to the laboratory. The results have not yet become publicly available, nor the species of the _Mycobacterium_ pathogen isolated from the 1st case (Germany has suffered several cases of infection with _M. caprae_, mainly affecting grazing cattle in Bavaria). It is also not known if the currently suspected animals were kept on the same epidemiological unit(s).

4. The epidemiological investigation has addressed movements of animals into and from the farm during the last 5 years, seeking possible contacts nationally, within the EC, and/or with "third countries" (located in Europe or elsewhere). Results of these investigations have not yet become publicly available. On top of their significance for the outside source of infection, they should exclude potential past dissemination of the pathogen from the farm.

There are several possibilities of the source of infection, such as traded cattle or other livestock, other TB-infected contact species such as pets, wildlife, or infected humans (zooanthroponosis).

This investigation will be followed when more information becomes available. - Mod.AS
