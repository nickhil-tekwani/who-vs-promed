A child is among 9 people awaiting test results today [21 May 2010]
for the deadly Hendra virus, after exposure to a dying horse on
Queensland's Sunshine Coast. Queensland's chief health officer,
Jeannette Young, said the people tested including a vet who treated
the horse, its owner, and her young daughter would not know any
conclusive results for another 6 weeks.

"There is one young child who's been tested," she told reporters in
Brisbane today [21 May 2010]. "9 people have potentially been exposed
to the virus. If a person develops any symptoms at all we ask them
urgently to go to their GP, contact the public health unit or go to
their local hospital and we will test them immediately." Queensland's
chief veterinary officer, Ron Glanville, said the property at
Tewantin, near Noosa, would be in quarantine "for some time" although
no signs had been put up to alert the public. He said another horse
on the property had tested negative to the virus and would not be put
down unless it became ill. He urged all horse owners in Queensland to
keep away from animals that showed "unusual" signs of illness, such
as staggering or twitching. "If you have a horse that's becoming sick
and has any sort of unusual signs, call your vet and minimise your
contact with the horse to protect yourself," he said.

The Tewantin outbreak is the 14th since Hendra virus killed horse
trainer Vic Rail in the Brisbane racetrack suburb of Hendra 16 years
ago. Symptoms in humans include flu-like illness, brain inflammation,
high fevers, headache, and drowsiness. 4 of the 7 people infected
with Hendra virus died, including vets Alister Rodgers and Ben Cunneen.

Scientists believe that fruit bats transmit the virus to horses,
which can infect humans who come into close contact.

A girl who comforted a dying horse is one of 9 people who have been
exposed to a fresh outbreak of the deadly Hendra virus on
Queensland's Sunshine Coast. The horse was put down on Monday [17 May
2010] after contracting the virus at a Tewantin property. It is
believed the girl did not know the horse had Hendra virus [infection]
when she was in contact with it.

Queensland chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young says none of the 9
people tested are showing symptoms of Hendra virus [infection] and
they will be forced to wait another 3 weeks for conclusive test
results. Another horse on the Sunshine Coast property is being tested
for the virus.

In the past 15 years 4 people have died from the virus infection,
including vet Ben Cunneen, 33, who died in August 2008 while working
at the Redlands Veterinary Clinic east of Brisbane. Another outbreak
at a Cawarral property near Rockhampton in central Queensland last
August [2009] also claimed the life of vet Dr Alister Rodgers, 55,
and killed 4 horses.

Cooroy vet Ben Poole says one of his staff treated the horse on the
Sunshine Coast property earlier this week. "We had a meeting in the
practice only last week saying, 'Look, have a heightened awareness
that this is potentially going to show up'," he said.

The manager of a Cawarral stud that was hit by the Hendra virus last
year [2009] says there was no need for the latest case. Debbie Brown
says a vaccine has been developed but cannot be tested until [AUD] 50
000 [approx USD 41 000] has been raised. "It's just such a shame that
once again we have to try and raise the money ourselves," she said.

[Hendra virus does not transmit readily between animals other than
flying foxes. Australian Animal Health Laboratory research shows that
horses, cats, and guinea pigs can excrete virus in their urine. The
virus isn't carried on the breath of horses. This helps to explain
why Hendra virus isn't highly contagious. The means by which Hendra
virus has 'spilled over' and infected the horses in Australia isn't
known. However, bat urine, aborted bat fetuses, or reproductive
fluids from bats infected with Hendra virus could have been involved.

Human infections with Hendra virus range from mild influenza-like
illness to fatal respiratory or neurological disease. Infected people
initially develop fever, headaches, myalgia (muscle pain), sore
throat, and a dry cough. They could also have enlarged lymph nodes,
lethargy and vertigo.

The incubation period (interval from infection to onset of symptoms)
ranges from 5 to 14 days. To date, there have been 7 confirmed human
cases including 4 deaths. One of those who died developed
pneumonitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and arterial
thrombosis. The patient died of cardiac arrest. Another person
demonstrated an unusual, progressive fatal neurological illness. He
initially had a mild type of inflammation of the brain
(meningoencephalitis) with a sore throat, headache, drowsiness,
vomiting, and neck stiffness. After treatment with antibiotics, he
made a full recovery, but 13 months later he developed signs of
encephalitis that progressed to coma and death. The 3 infected people
who made a full recovery have had no residual problems or relapse.

Hendra virus infection can be diagnosed by a number of different
laboratory tests: serum neutralization; enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA); polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay;
immunofluorescence assay; and virus isolation by cell culture.

There are currently no drugs or approved vaccine available to treat
Hendra virus infection. Intensive supportive care with treatment of
symptoms is the main approach to managing the infection in people.
