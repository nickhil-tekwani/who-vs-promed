MALARIA PROPHYLAXIS: CDC NOTICE - DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

Notice
In December 1999, CDC revised its recommendations for travelers to the
Altagracia Province of the Dominican Republic. This revision was based on
reports of a localized outbreak of malaria in this province, which included
cases in tourists who stayed only in resort areas. Tourists traveling to
resorts in the Altagracia Province were advised to take chloroquine
prophylaxis. Control measures undertaken by the Ministry of Health in the
Dominican Republic have eliminated local transmission in and around these
resort areas. Intensified surveillance indicates that the outbreak is
over. Therefore, as of February 17, 2000, CDC is no longer recommending
chloroquine prophylaxis for travelers to resort areas in the Dominican
Republic, but continues to recommend it for travelers to rural areas of the
Dominican Republic, excluding resort areas. CDC together with the Ministry
of Health in the Dominican Republic will be monitoring the situation closely.
