Unexplained Deaths Attributed to "Mutating Measles Virus"
--------------------------------------------------------
CALCUTTA: The undiagnosed fever in Siliguri and adjoining areas in north
Bengal has been identified as "mutating [mutated? measles virus." The
fever claimed yet another life on Mon 5 Mar 2001 in the North Bengal
Medical College and Hospital, taking the toll to 39. Health Minister Partha
De told newspaper correspondents that the mysterious disease had been
identified as "mutating measles virus" by the Indian Council for Medical
Research (ICMR) in its preliminary report.
Meanwhile, a patient suffering from the fever succumbed during the day at
the NBMCH, while 8 others were still in hospital. However, there had been
no new admissions. The Health Minister stated that the disease initially
affected the renal and respiratory systems, that the virus [infection
could not be arrested by normal measles vaccine, and that the usual
precautions against communicable diseases should be followed.

[This preliminary report from the ICMR is difficult to interpret. Measles
virus infection is normally associated with childhood illnesses with
characteristic signs and symptoms, or rarely with deferred neurological
complications such as encephalitis and, very rarely, with subacute
sclerosing panencephalitis. Atypical forms of measles have been described
which have been attributed to aberrant responses to vaccination with
inactivated vaccines. Renal involvement is not usually described in
relation to measles virus infection. Neither do the previous accounts of
the fever correspond with the hemorrhagic "black" form of measles. Measles
is a widespread infection; the isolation of measles virus or detection of
antibody alone should not serve as confirmation of diagnosis in these
unexplained deaths. More information is urgently required to evaluate this
report.
Although measles virus is antigenically stable and has been effectively
controlled by a single vaccine, highly mutated forms of the measles virus
genome have been described. This phenomenon of "hypermutation" is
associated with persistent infection. It seems unlikely in the absence of
precise information that the ICMR has isolated a hypermutated virus
associated with acute disease. More likely the designation "mutating"
refers to the agent's apparent failure to be controlled by measles vaccine.
