Global COVID deaths drop to lowest since early pandemic months
--------------------------------------------------------------
Weekly COVID-19 deaths dropped to the lowest level since March 2020, signaling an encouraging development that should be seen through a cautious lens, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said yesterday [26 Apr 2022] at a briefing.

In US developments, Pfizer/BioNTech has submitted an application for emergency use of its vaccine for booster doses in children, as the nation's cases creep upward.

WHO presses countries to keep tracking COVID
--------------------------------------------
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said cases and deaths continue to drop, with just over 15 000 deaths reported to the WHO last week, which he said is the lowest weekly total since March 2020.

He said the welcome news comes with the caveat that countries are reducing their testing, and the WHO is receiving less information on transmission and evolution. "But this virus won't go away just because countries stop looking for it," Tedros said. "It's still spreading, it's still changing, and it's still killing."

The threat of new variants is still very real, and scientists still don't understand the long-term consequences of infection, he said, repeating the WHO's call for countries to maintain their surveillance activities.

In China, Beijing has completed its 1st round of mass testing, which targeted 20 million people and yielded 12 cases. Cases in the city have been slowly rising, prompting mass testing and fears that residents of the country's capital could face a lockdown, similar to Shanghai's -- which has been in effect for about a month.

About 1/3 of Beijing's recent cases are from school-related clusters, and officials have started weekly testing for teachers and students, according to the Global Times, an English-language news outlet based in China. One district has suspended in-person classes for primary and middle-school students.

In other global developments:
• The European Commission today [27 Apr 2022] proposed a strategy for moving away from the emergency phase of the pandemic. Key steps include increasing vaccination and boosting, integrating testing into routine disease surveillance systems, and sequencing enough samples to accurately detect new variants. It also includes investing in health system recovery, support for vaccines and treatments, and steps to strengthen global solidarity.
• Denmark is suspending its mass vaccination effort against COVID-19, given high vaccine uptake and an epidemic that is under control. Danish Health Authority officials said vaccination is still recommended, and people are urged to receive their full vaccine course. Fourth doses are recommended only for those with very weakened immune systems. They added that the vaccine program will resume in the fall [2022], when infections could increase again. In the meanwhile, experts will thoroughly assess vaccine program policies, with a release of the 2022-2023 plan expected before the summer [2022] holidays.

Pfizer submits application for pediatric booster vaccine
--------------------------------------------------------
Yesterday [26 Apr 2022], Pfizer said it has submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) an application for emergency use authorization of a COVID-19 vaccine booster dose in children ages 5-11.

The 10-microgram booster dose would be given 6 months after the primary series, and data from a phase 2/3 trial suggests a strong immune response from the booster, with no new side effects reported.

The application comes 1 day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released new seroprevalence data suggesting that as many as 3 in 4 children ages 17 and under in the United States have been infected with COVID-19, most during the omicron surge.

The 7-day average of new daily COVID-19 cases is 50 102, with 377 daily deaths, according to the Washington Post tracker. Numbers are ticking upward as the subvariants BA.2 and BA.2.12.1 take hold across the country. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?itid=hp_pandemic_gfx/&state=US]

The CDC's Nowcast estimates that BA.2 accounts for 68.1% of new COVID-19 cases, and BA.2.12.1 accounts for 28.7%. [https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions]

Despite the uptick, White House Chief Medical Adviser Anthony Fauci, MD, told PBS yesterday [26 Apr 2022] that he believed the country is out of the pandemic phase. [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/dr-fauci-on-why-the-u-s-is-out-of-the-pandemic-phase-2]

"We are certainly right now in this country out of the pandemic phase," Fauci said. "Namely, we don't have 900 000 new infections a day and tens and tens and tens of thousands of hospitalizations and thousands of deaths. We are at a low level right now."

He also told the Associated Press that the pandemic isn't over and that the United States is in more of a controlled phase. [https://apnews.com/article/covid-health-pandemics-infectious-diseases-united-states-b7fbd92253900045321878d97b8e1b89]

https://english.news.cn/20220427/a065006f01be45a085ba346ecc57a18b/c.html


Beijing reported 42 locally transmitted confirmed COVID-19 cases and 4 asymptomatic cases between 4 p.m. Tuesday [26 Apr 2022] and 3 p.m. Wednesday [27 Apr 2002], local authorities have said.

A total of 138 local infections have been logged since [22 Apr 2022], involving 8 districts, said Pang Xinghuo, deputy head of the Beijing municipal disease prevention and control center.

Children from 6 schools and 2 kindergartens accounted for 31% of the infections, Pang said.

Beijing is conducting 3 rounds of nucleic acid testing from Mon-Sat. The 1st round has been completed, with over 19.8 million residents sampled for testing.

Three communities in Beijing were classified as high-risk areas for COVID-19 on Wednesday [27 Apr 2022], and 5 others as medium-risk areas, bringing the total number of high-risk areas in Beijing to 5 and medium-risk areas to 16.

[3] COVID transition phase
Date: Wed 27 Apr 2022

https://edition.cnn.com/2022/04/27/health/fauci-covid-pandemic-phase/index.html


The US is in 'transition phase' of pandemic, Fauci says
-------------------------------------------------------
The United States is "certainly, right now, in this country, out of the pandemic phase," Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser and the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on PBS's "NewsHour" on Tuesday [26 Apr 2022].

"Namely, we don't have 900 000 new infections a day and tens and tens and tens of thousands of hospitalizations and thousands of deaths. We are at a low level right now. So if you're saying, are we out of the pandemic phase in this country? We are," he said.

On Wednesday [27 Apr 2022], Fauci told CNN that his comments had been mischaracterized by some to mean that the pandemic is over, "which is not what I said."

"We're not over the pandemic. Don't let anybody get the misinterpretation that the pandemic is over, but what we are in is a different phase of the pandemic," he said. "A phase that's a transition phase, hopefully headed toward more of a control where you can actually get back to some form of normality without total disruption of society, economically, socially, school-wise, etc."

Fauci noted that, in fact, COVID-19 cases are trending up again, though it's not anywhere near the rise we saw over the winter with the omicron wave.

"So what we need to do is continue to be vigilant, to follow the CDC guidelines, to do the kinds of things that protect you: Get vaccinated, if you're not vaccinated; get boosted if you're eligible for a boost. If you do get infected, be aware that there is availability of antivirals."

Fauci's comments on PBS drew attention on the same day [27 Apr 2022] the Biden administration announced that he would not be attending the annual White House Correspondents Dinner after considering his individual risk.

"Each of us, in our own personal way, has to make an assessment of what risk you're willing to accept about getting infected," Fauci told CNN. "In general, the risk is low, but I made a personal assessment. I'm 81 years old, and if I get infected, I have a much higher risk."

Cases and hospitalizations are rising in the US
-----------------------------------------------
COVID19 cases in the US have tumbled dramatically over the past couple of months as the omicron wave receded.
But daily cases are still 2 times higher than they were for most of last summer.
New cases are ticking back up in most states, and hospitalizations have started to rise over the past week.
Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Is America ready to take the next step in its COVID-19 recovery?
Fewer people are dying of COVID-19 now than during most of the pandemic, but with more than 400 deaths a day, the past 2 months of COVID-19 have been more deadly than most recent flu seasons.
Fauci said that although the coronavirus won't be eradicated, the level of virus in society could be kept very low if people are intermittently vaccinated, possibly every year.
Currently, local health officials on the ground across the US are still working to get more people fully vaccinated and boosted against COVID-19.
The EU outlines its response to the next phase of the pandemic

According to Fauci, the COVID-19 situation in the United States also doesn't necessarily reflect what's happening in the rest of the world.
"Pandemic means a widespread, throughout the world infection that spreads rapidly among people," Fauci said. "So if you look at the global situation, there is no doubt this pandemic is still ongoing."
The European Commission said Wednesday that the COVID-19 pandemic is not over and that "vigilance and preparedness remain essential" as it published a set of proposals to help European countries manage the current phase and prepare for the next one.
The commission called on the 27 countries in the European Union "to strengthen their surveillance, healthcare systems, and overall pandemic preparedness" as well as "step up vaccination and boosting" and "continue targeted testing and sequencing" to accurately estimate variant circulation and detect new variants.
European Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said Wed that between 60% and 80% of the US population is estimated to have had COVID-19.
"How we prepare today for the next phase will determine the cause of the pandemic in the coming months and years," she said.
Looking ahead
In the US, shifting out of the pandemic is not language that Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, has heard in conversations within local health departments, she said Wed.
But there has been a subtle shift on the ground with local health officials now returning some focus to non-COVID areas such as maternal health, childhood immunizations, tuberculosis and HIV.
"I think there are subtle shifts being made at the local level health departments to normalize the pandemic response in a way that allows them to get back to the core work of their public health departments," Freeman said. "But those words that were used about the pandemic ending are not well-circulated in the public health area right now."

[Fauci clarifies that the pandemic isn't over, after saying the U.S. is out of the 'pandemic phase.'

Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, said on Wed 27 Apr 2022 that the pandemic was not yet over, after telling the "PBS NewsHour" on Tue 26 Apr 2022 that the United States was "out of the pandemic phase."

He offered clarification on NPR's "1A" on Wed 27 Apr 2022, saying: "I want to clarify one thing. I probably should have said the acute component of the pandemic phase. And I understand how that can lead to some misinterpretation."

...He told The Washington Post on Wed 27 Apr 2022], "We're really in a transitional phase, from a deceleration of the numbers into hopefully a more controlled phase and endemicity." (NY Times 27 Apr 2022, https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/04/27/world/covid-19-mandates-vaccine-cases) - Mod.LK]

[4] Long COVID
Date: Wed 27 Apr 2022

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/04/european-studies-shed-light-long-covid-risk-and-recovery


European studies shed light on long COVID risk and recovery
----------------------------------------------------------
A trio of new observational studies from Europe describes long COVID prevalence in Luxembourg, the effect of initial infection severity on risk in Sweden, and an occupational therapy program to ease symptoms in Ireland. The research was presented at the annual congress of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) in Portugal, which ended yesterday.

Symptoms lasting 15 weeks likely to persist
-------------------------------------------
Researchers from the Luxembourg Institute of Health surveyed 289 people about whether they had any of 64 common long COVID symptoms 1 year after they tested positive. Patients were also asked about their sleep quality and the effect of respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath on quality of life. Average patient age was 40.2 years, and 50.2% were women.

The researchers found that 6 in 10 patients (59.5%) had at least one COVID-19 symptom, and that symptoms that don't resolve by 15 weeks are likely to persist for at least a year. One in 7 participants (14.2%) indicated that they couldn't fathom coping with their symptoms long term. The most common symptoms were fatigue, shortness of breath, and irritability.

One-third (34.3%) still had fatigue, while 12.9% said respiratory symptoms were affecting their quality of life, and 54.2% still had sleep issues. Patients who had moderate or severe infections were twice as likely as those with asymptomatic cases to report symptoms, with 63.8% versus 38.6% still having poor sleep quality.

"Participants with a mild form of the acute illness were more likely than those who'd been asymptomatic to have at least one symptom at one year, and to have sleep problems, but to a lesser extent than those with a moderate or severe acute illness," lead author Aurelie Fischer, a PhD student, said in an ESCMID news release. [https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/950713]

The results also showed that some symptoms tend to cluster together, suggesting that there are different subtypes of long COVID. "Long COVID can still have a large impact on quality of life, even a year after the acute infection," Fischer said. "This work will help raise awareness of the needs of people with long COVID and contribute to the development of health strategies to help them."

ICU patients most likely to have long COVID
-------------------------------------------
In Sweden, Karolinska Institutet modeled associations between severity of COVID-19 infection, underlying medical conditions, previous healthcare usage, sociodemographic factors, and long COVID in 205 241 adults in Stockholm. Participants had tested positive for COVID-19 90 to 360 days before, from 1 Mar 2020 to 31 Jul 2021.

Of the 205 241 COVID-19 patients, 32% of those who had been admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) developed long COVID, as did 6% of hospitalized participants and 1% of outpatients.

The most common symptom among outpatients was fatigue (26%), while shortness of breath was most common in both hospitalized and ICU patients (23% and 39%, respectively). Among patients with mild infections, women were more than twice as likely as men to develop long COVID. A similar link with female sex was identified in hospitalized patients but not those treated in an ICU.

Also among participants with mild illness, a history of mental illness or asthma was tied to twice the risk of developing long COVID. This link was weaker among hospitalized patients and wasn't observed in ICU patients. A history of outpatient primary care visits was strongly associated with long COVID in those with mild illness but not in hospitalized or ICU patients.

Outpatient visits in the previous 10-12 months were much more common after, rather than before, infection, which the study authors said indicated persistence of symptoms well beyond the initial diagnosis.

"Our findings reveal different associations between age, sex, comorbidities, symptoms, and healthcare use in people with more severe and milder forms of disease, which indicates different clinical trajectories and characteristics of long COVID," lead author Pontus Hedberg, MD, said in an ESCMID press release. "Future research should focus on better understanding the persistence of this debilitating condition across different groups of individuals." [https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/950713]

The authors acknowledged not being able to evaluate the impact of vaccination or the omicron variant on long COVID.

Occupational therapy program helped patients cope
-------------------------------------------------
Researchers at St. James's Hospital and Trinity College in Dublin conducted a pilot occupational therapy program involving 53 COVID-19 patients who reported fatigue that interfered with their ability to participate in daily activities such as personal care, climbing stairs, work, and leisure pursuits. Of the patients, 73% were women. The median age was 51 years.

"We became concerned after seeing increasing numbers of patients who were having difficulty carrying out everyday activities because of fatigue," lead author Louise Norris, a senior occupational therapist at the hospital, said in an ESCMID news release. "We've previously helped those with other conditions, such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, learn techniques to manage their fatigue and felt we could use that experience to address the needs of those with long-term fatigue post COVID." [https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/950650]

About 68% of the 53 participants reported COVID-19 symptoms 12 weeks to 1 year after diagnosis, and 25% said they still had symptoms after 1 year. A total of 98% of long COVID patients reported moderate to severe fatigue, while 72% reported moderate to severe shortness of breath, and half had problems with concentration and memory (brain fog).

Among all participants, 74% reported moderate to severe problems trying to return to work, 64% said they had difficulty engaging in leisure activities, and 58% reported that they struggled with everyday activities such as making meals, driving, or going for a walk.

In the ongoing pilot program, patients participated in 3 1.5-hour online group interventions with an occupational therapist for 4 weeks. The sessions focused on self-management techniques to ameliorate fatigue and brain fog, with education on energy planning, stress reduction, and good sleep practices.

The therapist taught participants how to determine their body's and brain's limits so they could rest before reaching the point of exhaustion. Patients completed questionnaires before the study and 2 weeks after the last session about fatigue, energy levels, quality of life, and concerns about well-being.

A preliminary analysis of the questionnaire results revealed significant improvements in fatigue, quality of life, and concerns about wellbeing. "Initial results from our pilot programme are highly promising," Norris said. "They show equipping patients with a range of practical techniques can result in meaningful improvements in fatigue and quality of life. Patients also have fewer concerns about their wellbeing."

She said that the need is urgent for new and better ways of managing long COVID fatigue and its "wide-ranging, and in some cases, devastating, effects on people's lives."

[In the past 24 hours, 13 countries namely Germany (124 863), the USA (98 531), Italy (88 431), France (67 711), South Korea (57 439), Australia (45 896), Japan (37 258), Brazil (20 943), the UK (17 111), Thailand (14 437), Canada (11 646), Greece (11 487), and Vietnam (11 313) reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 4415 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 25 Apr 2022 to late 26 Apr 2022).

A total of 36 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 20 of the 36 countries are from the European region, 5 are from the Americas region, 2 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 3 from the South East Asia region, and none from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 5.7%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 8.9%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 29.6% increase in daily reported cases and an 8.4% decrease in reported deaths. This shows an overall global trend of decreasing cases (the US has shown an increasing trend in cases over the last few days) and reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 0.69 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 511.53 million cumulative reported cases and more than 6.25 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
