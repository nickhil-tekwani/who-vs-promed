[This is an update of the dengue situation in New Caledonia, based on the
latest official report from the Department of Health of New Caledonia.
Once again, thanks to Dr JP Grangeon and Nancy Klingler for keeping PACNET
focal point posted -- TK.
As mentioned in the previous message of 17/02/98 "Dengue 2 intensifying in
New Caledonia", the weekly number of new cases has been continuously
increasing since December 1997; 835 cases were notified from 1 January to
20 March 1998; 458 of the 463 confirmed cases were type 2 dengue, and 5 of
them were type 3 dengue; the latter occurred between 16 February and 8
March 1998. No death was reported. Twenty two (22%) of the new cases of
1998 are reported from Noumea; as well, Noumea, followed by Ouegoa and Poum
(both North of the Northern province), had the highest percentage of the
total of reported new cases during the 4 weeks prior to 20 March 1998. The
epidemic has quasi died off in Ouvea (one of the Loyalty Islands that was
affected by the present epidemic).
The weekly number of clinical new cases from the week starting 24/11/97
(week 48 of 1997) to the week starting 16/03/98 (week 12 of 1998) is shown
hereunder:

The Department of Heath is still agressively applying perifocal vector
control measures including insecticide spraying and reduction of mosquito
breeding sites. Awareness campaigns targeting at both the public and health
professionals are also regularly conducted.
