Airport malaria in Luxembourg
-------------------------------------
In Luxembourg 3 cases of _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria have
been diagnosed in people who had not visited a malaria endemic
area.
A husband and wife had travelled by air from Luxembourg to
Scotland via Brussels on 30 May and returned on 18 June [1999.
The woman was admitted to the Centre Hospitalier de Luxembourg
on 29 July with fever and raised aminotransferases. Diagnosis was
made by a blood smear and later confirmed by the Institute of
Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium.
The husband who was also febrile was advised to have a blood
test, which proved positive for _P. falciparum malaria_. They live in
a village situated about 2 km east of Luxembourg airport.
The third patient, unrelated to the previous two, had not travelled by
air. She lives in a village situated 3 to 4 km east of the airport and
was admitted to hospital in the town of Trier in Germany. Her illness
was reported widely in the German media on 12 August.
In l997 two cases of airport _P. falciparum_ malaria were
diagnosed in Luxembourg. One was in a child who was admitted to
hospital with a persistent fever. A blood test showed a severe
pancytopenia and acute leukaemia was suspected. When the
blood smear was examined more thoroughly, it showed the
presence of _P. falciparum_. A few days later her mother became
febrile and malaria was diagnosed on a blood smear. Both
diagnoses were confirmed by the Institute of Tropical Medicine in
Antwerp. Mother and child had recently travelled from Luxembourg
airport to Iceland, but they had never been in a malaria endemic
area. They lived in a village 1 to 2 km east of the airport .
These 5 cases of malaria have occurred during periods of high
summer temperatures, which may have allowed imported
_Anopheles_ mosquitoes to survive. A common feature of the 5
cases seen in 1997 and 1999 was severe thrombocytopenia.
The diagnosis of malaria should be considered in patients with high
fever without an obvious cause, even when they have had no
history of travel to a malaria endemic country, especially if they live
near an international airport and if the blood tests show
thrombocytopenia. Individual countries should check that the World
Health Organization's recommendations on aircraft disinsecting
procedures (1) are being implemented. Luxembourg is considering
whether to introduce aircraft disinsecting on selected flights.
