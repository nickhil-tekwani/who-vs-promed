The Norwegian Veterinary Institute has detected pandemic influenza A subtype H1N1 in turkeys from a breeder farm in Ostfold. The diagnosis is based on an initial ELISA test against influenza A, followed up by an HI test against several subtypes of influenza A (H5, H7, H9, H1, H3). Titration of sera revealed a strong positive response against the H1N1 A/California/07/2009 pandemic strain, and the same virus was also detected by real-time PCR in 2 animals from the flock.

Blood was sampled from the animals in connection with the national AI surveillance program. There were no clinical signs in the flock, except from a recent short period of drop in egg production (10-12 percent). Initial screening for avian associated subtypes of influenza A showed a low-grade reaction against H5. Serology was followed up by real-time PCR on cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs. Tissue samples from recently dead birds were also analyzed (lung tissue, spleen, ileum). All PCR samples were negative for influenza A virus.

Epidemiological investigations revealed that at least 2 persons working with the animals had been sick with flu-like symptoms, and one of them had been diagnosed with pandemic H1N1 influenza. HI tests using swine associated virus-strains (H1, H3) subsequently revealed a strong positive response against the H1N1 A/California/07/2009 pandemic strain. A subsequent real-time PCR on tissue from the oviduct/ovary of recently dead birds was able to detect pandemic H1N1 virus.

A short report in the Virology Journal from 2010 describes infection of turkeys with pandemic-H1N1 through intrauterine inoculation, which is a plausible route of exposure in turkey production, considering the use of artificial insemination involving intrauterine deposition of semen.

Initial restrictions on the farm were lifted due to the exclusion of avian influenza. Hatching eggs and poults from the farm will be followed up with serological screening.

[Influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 virus has been identified, since the emergence of this strain, in domestic pigs in many countries, initially coined "swine flu virus." It was eventually clarified that humans could infect swine, leading to subclinical or mild signs in the animals, while pork and pork products, handled in accordance with good hygienic practices recommended by the WHO, FAO, Codex Alimentarius Commission, and the OIE, are not a source of infection. There was no evidence that the virus is zoonotic in the sense of animal-to-human infections or that it is transmitted by food.

In January 2013, the Norwegian Veterinary Institute confirmed influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus in samples taken from pigs in herds at Gudbrandsdalen and Rogaland. In both cases, the disease was observed in the pigs after farm workers had a flu-like illness just before the pigs were sick, and it was thought the pigs became infected due to contact with ill farm workers (see 20130127.1517145).

Outbreaks of A(H1N1) pdm09 in turkeys have been reported in several countries. Co-infection of this strain and avian H9N2 influenza viruses in turkeys have been considered to provide the opportunity for their reassortment, allowing novel reassortant viruses be transmitted to other avian species (Ref at http://www.nature.com/articles/srep10130?message-global=remove&WT.ec_id=SREP-631-20150602).

The current event, to the best of our knowledge, is the 1st case of natural infection with A(H1N1) pdm09 in turkeys in Norway. We are grateful to Siri Kulberg Sjurseth for the information.

Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 continues to circulate as the dominant virus in many countries worldwide; infections in animals do not require, so far, notification to the OIE (see OIE's Q&A at http://www.oie.int/en/for-the-media/press-packs/pandemic-h1n1-2009-questions-and-answers/).

A recent (14 Mar 2016) Norwegian media report on H1N1 in humans, in Sulmona, indicated that "sporadic events should not alarm the population, do not require prophylaxis such as quarantine or isolation for contacts or insulation measures." The local public health authorities were cited confirming that the seasonal flu vaccine provides protection against the disease (see, in Norwegian, at http://www.oie.int/en/for-the-media/press-packs/pandemic-h1n1-2009-questions-and-answers/). - Mod.AS
