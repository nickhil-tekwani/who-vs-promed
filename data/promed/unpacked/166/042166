The French government on Friday [26 Oct 2018] ordered a 3-month ban of a widely used pesticide after dozens of people, many of them farmworkers, fell ill in western France in recent weeks.

The move came after metam sodium was suspected when victims reported burning eyes and respiratory difficulties near Angers, an area that produces huge amounts of lamb's lettuce, also known as cornsalad. The salad green is popular on French and European tables, and producers often spread metam sodium powder on the ground to protect the plants against a wide range of insects. But the product, one of the most widely used pesticides in the USA and Europe, is considered a "probable human carcinogen" by the US Environmental Protection Agency and is not meant to be applied directly to plants.

There have been at least 3 outbreaks of illness in the Maine-et-Loire department since 28 Sep 2018, possibly because the product was improperly applied on land that was too dry during a period of unseasonably warm weather, officials said.

Of the 61 reported cases, 17 people had to be briefly hospitalised, prompting local authorities to suspend metam sodium use earlier this month [October 2018].

The national ban "is a wise decision for the health of our farmworkers and citizens," local lawmakers in President Emmanuel Macron's LREM party said in a statement. "We now need to help producers to quickly roll out existing alternatives" to the pesticide.

Metam sodium, sold under brand names including Vapam and Sectagon, is authorised in the EU until 2022, when it will come up for review by regulators.

[Soil fumigants are pesticides placed into the soil before planting to control pests such as nematodes, fungi, and weeds. Soil fumigants may be a liquid or gas at ambient temperatures, but once placed in the soil, they form gasses that move through the soil to control pests. Metam sodium and metam potassium are liquids but are converted into the gas methyl isothiocyanate (MITC) following application. Some gas may escape after the fumigant has been placed in the soil.

Metam sodium and metam potassium are non-selective soil fumigants with fungicidal, herbicidal, insecticidal, and nematicidal properties. They are dithiocarbamate salts that break down quickly in the environment to degrade MITC, which is highly volatile and is responsible for the fumigant properties of metam sodium and metam potassium.

MITC is a potent, direct-acting irritant to the eyes and respiratory tract. Death results from acute pulmonary congestion and hemorrhage. Developmental studies indicate that MITC was not teratogenic but caused delayed growth at maternally toxic concentrations (see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK201333/).

Acute exposure to bystanders or fumigant handlers is possible following metam sodium/metam potassium application due to volatilization and off-site movement of MITC.

It is likely this particular soil additive is a problem, and teaching producers about application safety and personal protective equipment is very important. We certainly hope these individuals recover.
