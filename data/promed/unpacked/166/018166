The Statens Serum Institut reports bird flu has been detected in a Danish harbor seal. The seal was found dead on a beach on Southwest Funen in September 2021 and examined at the Center for Diagnostics at Technical University of Denmark (DTU) as part of the disease monitoring of fallen game.

The seal was emaciated with pronounced skin changes on large parts of the body of uncertain significance and cause. Influenza virus was detected in the lung, but otherwise no other disease-causing organisms could be detected that could explain why the seal was dead.

The Center for Diagnostics at DTU has stated that they examined 29 harbor seals and 15 gray seals in 2021, of which only this one was positive for influenza virus.

Upon further investigation at the Danish Veterinary Consortium, the virus turned out to be highly pathogenic avian influenza [HPAI] virus of the subtype H5N8.

The detected virus is closely related to the viruses that have been the cause of bird flu outbreaks in wild birds and domestic poultry since the autumn of 2020, both here and in the rest of Europe.

Seals are known to be susceptible to avian influenza virus.

In recent seasons with avian influenza in birds, the discovery of HPAI in wild mammals has been increasingly reported, including seals and wild foxes in northern Europe. These findings have been seen primarily in animals with neurological symptoms, or found dead.

When mammals are infected with viruses from birds, there is a risk that the virus will mutate and adapt to its new host species and mammals in general.

The Danish Veterinary Consortium has performed a detailed analysis of the virus genome from the wild seal and found some mutations in the virus that show signs of possible adaptation to mammals, although it was not possible to analyze the full genome due to the quality of the material.

[The original announcement of SSI, published 17 Feb 2022, is available at https://tinyurl.com/y5pd4553 (in Danish). It includes a picture of the infected animal, and the following additional commentary:

"Denmark was hit by a serious outbreak of HPAI, which stretched from autumn 2020 to July 2021, infecting 16 poultry flocks and more than 300 wild birds.

"HPAI has been detected again in wild birds and in poultry flocks since the beginning of [the current season, starting] November 2021. New cases are still detected in wild birds every week. So far, a total of 10 flocks have been hit this season, the latest just a few days ago.

"Viruses in both seasons are related and belong to the variant of HPAI H5 called clade 2.3.4.4b. While primarily viruses with the H5N8 subtype were found last season, during the current season H5N1 is by far the predominant substrain".

According to the weekly-updated report from EU's reference laboratory for avian influenza (Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie, IZSVe), based upon information from 31 European countries, the current HPAI H5N1 epizootic has peaked during the second week of 2022, after which a distinct weekly decrease is apparent. The current data relate to HPAI positive events recorded in wild birds, captive birds and poultry between 8 Oct 2021 and 17 Feb 2022 (https://www.izsvenezie.com/documents/reference-laboratories/avian-influenza/europe-updates/HPAI/2021-1/total-events.pdf).
