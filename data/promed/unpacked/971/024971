The [Taiwan] Centers for Disease Control (CDC) on Tuesday [18 Jun 2013] announced Taiwan's 2nd case of Japanese encephalitis this year [2013] and urged the public to take precautionary measures in order to prevent mosquito bites.

The patient, a 17-year-old student from the southern county of Pintung, was discharged from hospital on 8 Jun [2013], a week after being diagnosed with the disease, the CDC said. He received his 4th vaccine booster against the disease in 2003.

Taiwan's other case of the potentially deadly disease this year [2013] was found in nearby Kaohsiung City earlier this month [June 2013], a 52-year-old male who is still hospitalized, according to the CDC.

Cases of Japanese encephalitis in Taiwan are most commonly seen from May through October, with June and July being the peak time of infections, the CDC said.

The number of infections has declined since 1968, when inoculations [vaccinations] began. Since recently, there have between 20 and 30 infections each year, with 2 fatalities at most, it said.

The CDC warned, however, that those who survive the disease risk developing after-effects such as personality disorder, mental retardation, speech impediment, etc. It warned the public to stay away from where vector mosquitoes breed, such as pig pens and other farms with animals.

[As moderator CP noted in a 17 Jul 2012 ProMED-mail post reporting 2 cases of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infections in Taiwan in 2012 (archive no. 20120717.1204835): "Taiwan is within the broad geographical endemic Japanese encephalitis belt that extends from South Asia through Southeast Asia, East Asia, and the northern tip of Australia. Japanese encephalitis is the principal cause of viral encephalitis in Asia, with 30 000 to 50 000 cases reported annually. Although most Japanese encephalitis virus infections are inapparent, they can progress to encephalitis and death, with neurological sequelae in some of those who survive. The virus is maintained in birds and transmitted by _Culex_ mosquitoes. Swine may serve as amplifying hosts.

Japanese encephalitis is a vaccine-preventable disease. The Japanese encephalitis season is from May-October, and although Japanese encephalitis infection has been infrequent in Taiwan, those that work in high-risk areas, such as rice paddies, livestock quarters, ponds, and irrigation ditches at dusk, when the mosquitoes are at their most active, should be vaccinated. To lower the chances of infection, long sleeves and pants should be worn, and mosquito repellant should be applied to exposed areas if activity in these places cannot be avoided. More information can be found at: http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/jencephalitis/facts.htm. - Mod.CP"

The boy noted in the above report had his last JEV vaccine booster in 2003. The vaccine most likely was an inactivated one, so the duration of protection would have declined after a lapse of 10 years.
