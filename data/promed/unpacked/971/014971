Rabies: the biggest danger factor is the lack of risk perception
----------------------------------------------------------------
The College of Veterinarians of the Province, and the local Food Science Directorate warned about the need to prevent rabies through vaccination. All animals should be vaccinated. No matter where they live, in closed yards, apartments, or terraces, the risk is significant and the disease deadly.

"We do prevention against rabies fundamentally with the anti-rabies vaccination of pets," highlighted the Director of Food Science, veterinarian Andrés Castro.

The issue runs through news agencies again and again and crosses the community as a whole because after 40 years, in the province of Buenos Aires, a woman died in Coronel Suárez as a result of being infected with rabies by a cat that bit her.

"It is very difficult to reach the population and for the population to become aware," said the veterinarian. Because despite [there] being a vaccine that can be applied for free in mass vaccination campaigns or even every day in the Bromatology [Food Science] facility; there are people who do not know or underestimate the occurrence of the virus. However, as a veterinarian, Agustín Romero remarked last Sunday [23 May 2021], "rabies is always latent." [and a real threat - Mod.TG]

In our city, the sector where the most bats -- they are almost always the vector animals of the virus -- and it is confirmed that they had rabies, is the center. Because they prefer the heights, the buildings, Castro said. And it is also often the sector of the city where most people underestimate or minimize the need to vaccinate pets against rabies.

It does not matter if the pet lives in an apartment, on a terrace, or inside a house, it should always be vaccinated against rabies, once a year, every year. Because rabies bats have neurological problems, they fall, they do not fly and there are more chances that they will be in contact with the pet in any of these places.

"We are among the municipalities working the most on the issue," said Castro, and the statistics support this when it was observed that last year [2020] 80% more domestic animals were vaccinated in the sum of vaccines applied both in the campaign and in the Bromatology area.

In a talk promoted by the College of Veterinarians of the Province, this Friday [28 May 2021] the veterinarian Gustavo Martínez marked the lack of perception of risk as important, beyond the legislation that governs and mandates the vaccination of animals against rabies.

He said that lack of risk perception both by the population and by some professionals, "means there is less vaccination, fewer complaints when a person is bitten by animals, and less epidemiological surveillance," he explained.

Another problem for the Province, he said, "is that not all municipalities have well-trained zoonoses or veterinary areas."

Martínez relied on maps and graphics of the Province to indicate that "from 2012 to date, the appearance of positive bats has increased exponentially, but mainly because the surveillance of this species has increased."

And he warned, "so far this year [2021] there have been 36 cases of rabies in bats." There are 2 milestones in recent years, the mutation from one species to another. That is the confirmed transmission of rabies from a bat to another animal. In 2017 in Valeria del Mar, and in 2020 the confirmation of a cat with rabies in Balcarce.

Based on different surveys, he also showed that the number of canines vaccinated against rabies throughout the Province is estimated to be between 25 and 26 percent, and noted this percentage barely reaches 16 percent in the case of felines.

In conclusion, Castro urged, "every pet should be vaccinated against rabies."

Prevention measures
- Compulsory vaccination of dogs and cats from 3 months of age and annual re-vaccination. In the event of an outbreak, other vaccination guidelines can be considered.
- Avoid contact with and feeding unknown dogs and cats to prevent accidents and potentially rabies.
- Avoid contact with bats, especially if they are down or with signs of disease.

- Following a bite:
- wash the wound with plenty of soap and water;
- do not put alcohol or other disinfectants;
- go quickly to the nearest health center to be treated by the team of health professionals;
- the professional will evaluate the need to prescribe antibiotics, a vaccine with the anti-tetanus component, and specific anti-rabies treatment.

http://outbreaknewstoday.com/argentina-reports-1st-human-rabies-case-since-2008/


The Ministry of Health of the Province of Buenos Aires together with the Ministry of Health of the Nation of Argentina recently reported a confirmed case of human rabies, according to a Communique from the Uruguay Ministry of Health.

Argentina has not reported a case of human rabies since 2008; however, it registered cases in bats every year in several provinces including Buenos Aires.

The case involved a 33-year-old woman living in Coronel Suárez, south center of the Province of Buenos Aires, who had consulted the health service on 18 Apr 2021 due to nervous symptoms (weakness in upper limbs and altered sensation ) which evolved into a deterioration in the level of consciousness, leading to a coma and subsequent death.

During the investigation and talks with her relatives, the antecedent of a bite by a feline emerged at the beginning of March [2021], and she had not consulted [a physician - Mod.TG] at that time. In this case, by genetic sequencing, the rabies variant has been identified as a bat.

[2] USA (Alaska): wild animals, pets, human exposure, alert
Date: Thu 3 Jun 2021
Source: Anchorage Daily News [edited]
https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/rural-alaska/2021/06/01/western-alaska-is-experiencing-an-unprecedented-rabies-outbreak-officials-say/


State health and environment officials are warning residents of Western Alaska and the Bering Strait region to vaccinate pets and be wary of wildlife because of an unprecedented rabies outbreak.

"I don't think we've ever seen such a high number of cases of rabies," said Dr Robert Gerlach with the state Department of Environmental Conservation.

The number of rabies cases varies year to year, but the Bering Strait region normally sees only 4 or 5 animals with confirmed cases each year, according to a statement from Alaska's health and environmental conservation departments. Since October [2020], over 35 cases have been confirmed in the area, officials said.

Cases have been reported along the coast from Bristol Bay to the North Slope, but Nome had the largest number of cases, Gerlach said.

The rabies virus is generally carried by arctic or red foxes, Gerlach said. The arctic fox population usually cycles through high and low stages depending on the population size of the arctic hare. Gerlach said there's an abundance of both animals now, which is contributing to the outbreak.

"Then we just see an increased interaction among those foxes in the other animals, other carnivores, which have the opportunity to spread the virus," he said.

Rabies was also confirmed in a river otter, which Gerlach said has not happened in more than 20 years -- showing the extent of spread happening in wild animals.

Rabies is a deadly disease and poses a serious public health problem. Animals who have contracted rabies generally act in one of 2 ways: either they become extremely aggressive, or they enter into a depressed and complacent phase, potentially causing them to wander around disoriented and or defensively attack, Gerlach said.

Several people have been exposed to dogs who had rabies and underwent a rabies treatment plan or vaccine plan to make sure they were safe, Gerlach said.

The outbreak was complicated by a simultaneous outbreak of distemper, which often looks similar to rabies and is also deadly for dogs. Distemper has no treatment and has a high mortality rate, and an adult dog has about a 50% chance of survival, Gerlach said. The distemper outbreak made it difficult to discern which disease sick dogs were dealing with, he said.

Both rabies and distemper can be prevented through annual vaccinations for pets, and vaccinations are the best way to protect pets and people because they reduce the chance of spreading disease.

"The other thing is to keep your pet contained and not let them run loose, especially where they might interact with a wild fox or a rabid fox that may enter the community and expose the dog," Gerlach said.

[3] USA (Florida): raccoon, cat, human exposure, alert
Date: Sat 5 Jun 2021

Health officials warned residents to stay clear of wildlife and stray animals after a raccoon with rabies attacked someone and their cat over Memorial Day weekend [29-31 May 2021].

The attack occurred on 29 May 2021 and the raccoon tested positive for the deadly virus [2 Jun 2021], according to the Florida Department of Health in Indian River.

Spokeswoman Stacy Brock said she could not give details about the person, but said the raccoon did make contact with them and the cat died as a result.

Brock said the person was undergoing preventative treatment for the virus.

The state health agency issued the alert Thursday for a roughly 15-mile [24-km] stretch of Orchid Island between County Road 510 in Wabasso and Round Island Park near the St Lucie County line.

In addition, a raccoon tested positive in a Sugar Hill neighborhood of Jensen beach [Martin County]. Also, a bat with rabies was found inside the Treasure coast square Mall in Jenson Beach as well.

[4] USA (New York): raccoon, possible cattle exposure

A raccoon was killed by a Somerset farmer Thursday [3 Jun 2021] and was the 4th confirmed rabid raccoon in Niagara County this spring, according to the Niagara County Department of Health.

Officials said the farmer killed the raccoon after it had entered his barn. The farmer said the animal was acting odd and was in proximity to his cattle.

Health department officials submitted the animal carcass for testing to the State Department of Health Wadsworth Center, Griffin Laboratory. Even though there was no known contact between the raccoon and the farmer's cattle, arrangements are being made to isolate the cattle for an observation period, officials said.

Raccoons, skunks, and foxes are all common wildlife carriers of the rabies virus. It is possible that a rabid animal can shed the virus by direct contact before symptoms appear visible, according to county health officials. A rabid animal can be confirmed only by submitting a laboratory sample.

[5] USA (Colorado): skunk, horse, dog
Date: Fri 4 Jun 2021

https://www.dailycamera.com/2021/06/04/five-skunks-test-positive-for-rabies-in-weld-county-horse-tests-positive-in-adams-county/


In recent months, 5 skunks in Weld County have tested positive for rabies, and health officials are reminding people to not touch or go near wild animals.

According to a news release, 2 of the skunks were found between Milliken and Platteville, another 1 was found east of Platteville, and 2 more in the Dacono/Frederick/Erie area.

In all 5 cases, the skunks acted aggressively, and 4 of the 5 cases involved dogs.

"Any mammal, including humans, is at risk of contracting rabies," according to the news release. "The risk of human exposure to rabies increases when pets and domestic animals are not properly vaccinated."

Health officials stress that all domestic animals, such as cats, dogs, horses, and livestock, should be vaccinated against rabies by a licensed veterinarian, the release said.

Signs of rabies include increased saliva and drooling, nocturnal animals seen out during the daytime, and slow or difficult movement. Other signs may include aggressive behavior, such as a wild animal attacking a domestic one.

Those who suspect they've been exposed to rabies should contact their medical provider immediately.

A miniature horse in Adams County has also recently tested positive for rabies, the 2nd case of rabies in domestic livestock in Colorado this year [2021].

According to a news release, the last equine rabies case in the state was documented in 2013.

Shortly after the miniature horse was euthanized, a skunk acting strangely was found and euthanized on the premises, testing positive for rabies as well.

"Rabies is a disease caused by a virus affecting the nervous system," the release said. "Rabies causes inflammation of the brain and spinal cord and is nearly always fatal if not treated."

The virus is transmitted in saliva through the bite of an infected animal, or in saliva to an open cut, scratch, or wound.

Community members can prevent exposure to rabies by not feeding, touching, or handling wild animals, being cautious of stray dogs and cats, having domestic animals vaccinated regularly, and being cautious if wild animals suddenly appear friendly or are walking or behaving erratically.

If a person's pet gets into a fight with a wild animal, care should be taken in handling their pet until it is given a bath, or any blood or saliva is washed off. Human rabies exposure may occur from the saliva left on their pet from the wild animal, according to the press release.

Rabies vaccine for pets is widely available and can be found by contacting a licensed veterinarian or checking for low-cost rabies vaccine clinics around the area at Humane Societies and local farm and ranch stores.

Colorado county map: https://geology.com/county-map/colorado-county-map.gif

This report deals with quite a variety of areas and animals. Rabies seems prevalent in wildlife and is spilling over into the domestic animals and human populations. Any time bats are involved, rabies should be high on the differential list.

While raccoon distemper and rabies may look somewhat similar in the raccoon, your safety and that of your pets are paramount. Do not take a chance and risk a bite because you think the raccoon is cute and friendly. Some people report raccoons are sluggish and dull mentally when affected with distemper, while they are aggressive when affected by rabies. However, there are 2 forms of rabies, the furious form, and the dumb form. The dumb form is where the animal appears sluggish and dull, moving slowly, and seemingly friendly or as if stunned by falling from a tree. This could as easily be rabies as distemper. This moderator has observed both kinds in raccoons testing positive for rabies.

While the New York case does not involve humans, the issue of possible cattle exposure is important. Most likely these are dairy cattle which means there may be a more close association with humans.

Likewise, the report from Colorado does not involve humans, but it does involve quite a few animals. I would be surprised if the individuals associated with the miniature horse are not taking post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Most horse owners have no problem caring for their ill equine friends and usually, it can mean being exposed to saliva. This article does not mention PEP for the owners of the horse.

If you are bitten, scratched, or exposed to saliva from an animal testing positive for rabies, or an animal whose behavior is questionable and the animal is unable to be tested, please consult a physician. In any case, wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water and seek medical attention. Medical personnel may recommend post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). - Mod.TG]
