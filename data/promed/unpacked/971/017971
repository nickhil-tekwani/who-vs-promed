The cholera death toll in Zimbabwe has risen above 1000, the United
Nations said Thursday [18 Dec 2008]. A total of 1111 deaths were
recorded by Wednesday [17 Dec 2008], an increase of 133 in 2 days,
the UN humanitarian office in Geneva said.

The latest figures, which are compiled by the WHO, also show that the

outbreak in August 2008. On Monday [15 Dec 2008], health officials
had spoken of 18 413 cases and 978 deaths.

A 4-month-old baby is being treated for cholera at the Karl Bremer
Hospital in Western Cape, the province's health department said on
Thursday [18 Dec 2008]. Spokesperson Faiza Steyn said the child from
Wallacedene informal settlement in Kraaifontein had been stabilized.
He was admitted on 6 Dec 2008.

"The specimen of this case was forwarded to the National Institute
for Communicable Diseases (NICD) for further laboratory analysis, to
ascertain the strain of cholera that was identified," said Steyn.

The child had no history of recent travel to Zimbabwe and or close
contact with a cholera case. Laboratory investigations on contacts of
this case were negative for the disease, said Steyn.

"It is not known at this stage where he could have got the disease
from; but hot weather and poor environmental living conditions could
be some of the factors," she said.

The poor Arua residents are grappling with endemic cholera as the Oli
Division in the Municipality is facing an outbreak of the disease in
low-income neighborhoods.

In just a month, over 38 cases have been registered, mainly in the
division, including 3 deaths district-wide. Statistics indicate that
28 people have been admitted at Oli Health Centre with one death
case. "Oli Health Centre has become Arua's referral hospital with
overcrowding of patients," the Municipal Health officer Dr Paul Onzubo said.

[4] Cholera - Nigeria (Niger state)

An outbreak of cholera in the Egbagi Majin village in Kede district
of Mokwa Local Government Area of Niger State has reportedly claimed
8 lives, one of them being the wife of the village head. A majority
of those who died, according to a report from the village, were women.

Nigerian Tribune has learned that about 15 others were hospitalized
as a result of the outbreak. According to a source in the area, the
outbreak could have been as a result of contaminated water being
drunk by the villagers who were just relocating after a flood
disaster 2 months ago.

[5] Cholera - Congo DR (eastern provinces)

Since early October 2008, high morbidity and mortality rates
associated with a cholera epidemic outbreak have been registered in
the Maniema, Katanga, North and South Kivu provinces. Ministry of
Health (MoH) statistics show that more than 25 503 cholera cases had
been registered, including 515 deaths in the localities mentioned
below. The following are statistics from the MoH.

In Katanga province, more than 10 214 cases and 229 deaths have been
registered and Red Cross efforts will be concentrated on towns such
as Lubumbashi, Likasi, Kolwezi, Bukama and Kasenga localities where
the mortality rate is very high. In the last week of November 2008,
the Kipushi health zone was noted as one of the most affected, with
several cases registered. A Red Cross team was sent to the field to
assess the situation in the Kipushi health zone which is also
reported to be badly affected.

In Maniema province the focus is on the Kailo, Alunguli, Kindu and
Basoko health zones, where according to the Maniema provincial
committee of the RCDRC, 189 cases and 11 deaths have been registered
over the past weeks. This information has been confirmed by the World
Health Organization (WHO).

In North Kivu, where ICRC is working, the health zones of Binza,
Bwambizo, Goma, Karisimbi, Kirotche, Masisi, Rutchuru and Walikale
are most affected, with nearly 8826 cases and more than 229 deaths
registered out of a total population of 1 272 981 inhabitants. The
possibility to carry out sensitization, disinfection, environmental
hygiene and water chlorination is more difficult in this region due
to the ongoing conflict. The numbers registered are those recorded in
the local hospital and do not include those occurring in other health
centres or at home. By the same period, well more than 5000 cases
have been registered in South Kivu, with the most affected health
zones including Minova (which shares boundaries with North Kivu),
Nundu, Baraka/Fizi (which is an endemic zone), Kalehe, Ruzizi,
Katana, Kabare, the town of Bukavu, Kadutu and Bagira. 1229 cases
have been registered so far in these localities alone, and there are
indications that this number is growing rapidly.

Overall, there is clear concern that the numbers are of a significant
level and there is a serious risk of the disease further spreading in
the 4 provinces already affected and also beyond. In which case, the
RCDRC, supported by the International Federation, needs to be
prepared to respond in those provinces not supported by the ICRC.

Cholera in Malawi has claimed 5 lives and more than 80 cases have
been recorded at the country's privately-run Likuni Hospital owned by
the Catholic Church in the capital Lilongwe, Director for Preventive
Health in the Ministry of Health, Stone Kabuluzi, confirmed here on
Wednesday [17 Dec 2008].

He told APA during an interview that the disease was fast spreading
among the rural community and that the number of cholera cases had
doubled at the hospital since the onset of the rainy season. "Today
[17 Dec 2008] the hospital has received 8 cases to increase the
number to 88 cholera cases with 5 deaths," he said.

Botswana has so far recorded 8 suspected cases of cholera. Speaking
at a media briefing at the Ministry of Health, Mrs. Shenaz El-Halabi,
Director of Public Health said of the 8, only 3 have been confirmed
to be cholera not 4 as reported in the media.

She said 1 case was confirmed in the Serowe/ Palapye area (Sekgoma
hospital) while the remaining 2 cases were confirmed in Francistown
(Nyangabwe Hospital). All 3 cholera victims are from neighbouring Zimbabwe.

[8] Shigellosis, day care centers - USA (Ohio)

The Greene County Combined Health District is tracking an outbreak of
the intestinal illness shigellosis that has hit several city daycare
centers. The county had 36 cases of the bacterial infection so far in
2008. 20 of those have been reported since 1 Nov 2008 in a handful of
Xenia daycare centers, said Amy Schmitt, communicable disease nurse
for the health district.

Health officials are working with day care operators to combat the
spread of the infections. "It's never our mission to close anyone
down," Schmitt said. "We work with day cares to decrease transmission
and prevent further infection."

Greene County's 3 dozen cases also seem minuscule compared with
Montgomery County where 325 cases were reported in 2008, Schmitt
said. Greene saw 8 cases of Shigella in 2007 and only 2 in 2006.
Warren County has had 4 cases reported in 2008, none of them in the
past 2 months.
