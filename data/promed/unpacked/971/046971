A Dundee [Scotland] primary school has been hit by an outbreak of scarlet fever. One parent of children at Downfield Primary School claimed that at least 20 pupils have fallen ill in recent days. The city council education department today declined to disclose the number infected, but confirmed advice had been sent to parents.

Scarlet fever is named for the distinctive rash it causes. It is usually a mild illness, but in rare cases it can have serious complications.

The parent told The Courier he was "concerned and angry" at what he claimed was a lack of swift communication from the school. He said the 1st child to be affected attends the school's nursery. A parent went on Facebook last week [week of 24 Feb 2014] to warn others, but the school itself did not send out a note to parents until Monday [3 Mar 2014]. "We are now are at a point where at least 20 children are off suffering from either scarlet fever or strains of it. These are only the cases I am aware of," the man said. A council spokesman said: "The school followed advice from the NHS Tayside school nursing service about the issuing of information. Parents and families have been given guidance about contacting a health professional if they think their child has scarlet fever. The primary's communication also stresses that any pupil with the condition should not attend school for five days after they take their first medication."

[ProMED-mail recently posted 3 reports on outbreaks of scarlet fever in the UK in the past several weeks: one in the South West Region of England (the counties of Devon, Cornwall, and Somerset; see ProMED-mail post Streptococcus, group A, scarlet fever - UK (03): (England) RFI 20140304.2311992), a 2nd in Lincolnshire (see ProMED-mail post Streptococcus, group A, scarlet fever - UK (02): England 20140302.2308816), and a 3rd in Cumbria (see ProMED-mail post Streptococcus, group A, scarlet fever - UK: England, alert 20140215.2279072.) This is now the 4th report of an outbreak of scarlet fever in the UK, this time in Dundee, Scotland.

Cumbria is in the North West Region of England; Lincolnshire is a county in the eastern part of the England, on the North Sea coast; Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall are adjacent counties of in the South West Region of England. Dundee, a city in the Tayside region of Scotland, lies within the eastern central Lowlands on the north bank of the Firth of Tay (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dundee).

We are not told if these regional outbreaks are part of a more widespread increase in the number of cases of scarlet fever or if there is any linkage of these 4 regional outbreaks. Genotypic characterization of outbreak isolates by molecular typing methods such as multilocus sequencing, ribotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), or random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis will be necessary to see if there is commonality among the outbreak strains. ProMED-mail would appreciate updated information on the epidemiology of the outbreaks in the affected regions, as well as information on the molecular characteristics of the strains of _Streptococcus pyogenes_ involved.
