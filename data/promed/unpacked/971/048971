In follow-up to the case-cluster of eosinophilic meningitis reported among
Chicago travelers to Montego Bay, Jamaica in 2000 [Promed PRO/EDR>
Eosinophilic meningitis, CDC confirmed - USA (Chicago), May 11, 2000,
there has been a new, independent case of eosinophilic meningitis in a
traveler who visited Ocho Rios, Jamaica in March 2001. This case indicates
ongoing risk for eosinophilic meningitis in Jamaica. Careful food
precautions continue to be indicated for this destination.
The patient is a middle-aged adult who vacationed with her family and 2
adult friends for 6 days at an Ocho Rios resort during the last week in
March 2001. While there, she ate mostly salads and seafood at the hotel
restaurant buffet. She traveled home via Montego Bay, but was there for
only a few hours with one last-minute meal consumed in the Montego Bay
airport. No other member of the party became ill.
During the 3 weeks following her visit, she developed progressively severe
posterior headaches, then meningismus and severe low back pain. She also
reported transient abdominal discomfort and rash over the trunk and upper
legs. Lumbar puncture revealed 507 WBC [per cubic mm, 47% eosinophils,
Glucose = 38 [mg/dl, Protein = 218 [mg/dl. Head CT was negative for
masses. MRI showed meningeal enhancement. During the course of her illness,
she experienced unusual facial pain and circumoral paresthesias, as well as
paresthesias of the hands and legs. She improved for several weeks
following corticosteroid therapy, with clearance of her CSF abnormalities.
Because of persistent CSF leak [likely following lumbar puncture, a blood
patch was applied. Following this, there has been a relapse of paresthesias
and malaise, approximately 2 months after the onset of her illness.
Serology for _Angiostrongylus_ is pending via the CDC. In conversations
with CDC, a forthcoming publication will detail the investigation of the
Chicago cases. By report, all components of the _Angiostrongylus_ life
cycle have been demonstrated in Jamaica. This current new case suggests
that _Angiostrongylus_ is now enzootic there, and continues to pose a risk
to residents and travelers in Jamaica.

[Thank you Dr. King for submitting this report. _Angiostrongylus
(Parastrongylus) cantonensis_ , also known as the rat lungworm, is a
nematode. In the outbreak reported on ProMED-mail in 2000, the implicated
food may have been a Caesar salad consumed by the students. Other outbreaks
and cases have been associated with the consumption of raw or
insufficiently cooked snails, slugs, or land planarians, which are
intermediate or transport hosts harboring infective larvae. Prawns, fish,
and land crabs that have ingested snails or slugs may also transport the
infective larvae. Lettuce and other leafy vegetables contaminated by small
molluscs may serve as a source of infection. The molluscs are infected by
first-stage larvae excreted by an infected rodent. From the above report it
is possible that the source of infection was either the salads or the
seafood (unspecified).
As Dr. King rightly states, this case further highlights the continued risk
of food-borne transmission of _Angiostrongylus_ in Jamaica. - Mod.MPP
