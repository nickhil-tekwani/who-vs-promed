Singapore records 688 cases of hand, foot and mouth disease in one week
----------------------------------------------------------
There were 688 cases of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) recorded
between 15 and 21 Apr 2007, the highest number recorded so far this
year. The figure was also 70 percent higher compared to the 398 cases
recorded in the same period last year [2006].
Not only is the number of cases a record high for this year [2007],
it has also exceeded the epidemic threshold the Health Ministry has
set for HFMD. The last HFMD epidemic in Singapore took place in
end-March last year [2006], when 784 cases were recorded in a week. A
total of 3 child-care centres had to be closed during the outbreak.
The Health Ministry has been posting weekly updates of the HFMD
situation on its website.
The Ministry said the present strain is CA16 [presumably an
abbreviation for coxsackivirus A16. - Mod.CP]. This is unlike the
EV71 virus, which is more likely to cause complications. And although
the number of HFMD cases reported to Health Ministry has increased,
the number of cases seeking treatment or admission to hospitals has
dropped compared to the previous week. A Health Ministry spokesperson
added that the Ministry has not detected the EV71 [Enterovirus 71]
circulating among HFMD patients.
The Ministries of Health and Community Development Youth and Sports
have sent out alert letters to child-care centres and schools with
reported clusters of HFMD cases. This is to remind them to put in
place measures to curb disease transmission.

[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common illness of infants
and children, which has tended to be more severe in South Asia than
elsewhere. It is characterized by fever, sores in the mouth, and a
rash with blisters. It can be caused by several viruses, the most
frequent of which are coxsackievirus A16 and enterovirus 71. The
current outbreak of HFMD in Singapore appears to be caused by
coxsackievirus A16 which is associated with a milder form of the
disease.
Patients infected with coxsackievirus A16 recover with minimal
medical treatment in 7 to 10 days. Rarely, patients with
coxsackievirus A16 infection may also develop "aseptic" or viral
meningitis and may need to be hospitalized for a few days.
Infection with Enterovvirus 71, on the other hand, may also cause
viral meningitis and, rarely, more serious diseases, such as
encephalitis, or a poliomyelitis-like paralysis. Enterovirus 71
encephalitis may be fatal. Cases of fatal encephalitis occurred
during outbreaks of HFMD in Malaysia in 1997 and in Taiwan in 1998.
Investigation of HFMD in Sarawak by Podin et al. (BMC Public Health.
2006 Jul 7;6:180) revealed that enterovirus 71 outbreaks occurred in
a cyclical pattern every 3 years and that coxsackievirus A16 may
co-circulate with human enterovirus 71. - Mod.CP]
