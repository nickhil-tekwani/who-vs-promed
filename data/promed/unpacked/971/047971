--------------------------------------------------------------------
The AllAfrica/Radio Dabanga article cited on [17 Oct 2016; http://allafrica.com/stories/201610170205.html] is unfortunately from October **2015** and it has likely been accidentally re-issued. The text, including case count, is almost exactly the same as before. Please see http://allafrica.com/stories/201510150328.html.
