[We are greatly indebted to Andy Comer for providing our readers with the
following brief summary (and his opinions) regarding vesicular stomatitis
and the viruses that cause it. In an effort to reduce volume of
ProMED-mailings, Andy requests that questions, references requests, and
comments be directed to him at <jnc0@cdc.gov> -- Mod CHC]
Vesicular stomatitis (VS), a disease of domestic livestock (cattle, swine,
and horses) in the Western Hemisphere, is caused by a group of related
viruses in the family Rhabdoviridae, genus _Vesiculovirus_. VS is
important in veterinary regulatory medicine because it is clinically
indistinguishable from
foot-and-mouth disease in cattle, sheep, goats, other ruminants, and swine.
In addition, VS lesions are equivalent to vesicular exanthema and swine
vesicular disease in swine. VS produces vesicles on the mucosa of the
tongue and gums, around the coronary band, and in the interdigital areas of
the feet. VS
infections usually are self-limiting and generally mild, and most affected
animals recover fully within two weeks.
Economic losses can occur in dairy cattle due to bacterial mastitis
secondary to infected teat lesions. Lameness can be a problem in horses.
Vesicular fluid contains large concentrations of virus, and excessive
salivation occurs as the vesicles rupture. The viruses are not stable in
the environment outside of living hosts.
Two different VS viruses, also known as serotypes because they are
antigenically distinguishable from one another, occur in the United States,
i.e., Indiana (VSI) and New Jersey (VSNJ). Both serotypes occur in Mexico
and Central America and extend into South America. Two additional
serotypes, Alagoas and Cocal, occur in South America. Antigenically, VSI,
Alagoas, and Cocal are closely related but distinct, whereas VSNJ is
antigenically even more distinct.
The first well-documented outbreaks of VS occurred in the United States in
1916 in cavalry horses. VSI and VSNJ were first isolated in 1925 and 1926,
respectively, although they had probably been present for centuries and
were detected only after cattle, horses, and swine were brought to the New
World in the sixteenth century. Serologic evidence of infection in
wildlife has been shown for VSNJ in the United States and for both VS
viruses in Panama, leading to speculation that sylvatic maintenance cycles
for these viruses exist.
VS is a zoonotic disease of undefined health impact. VS infection in
humans results in an acute, self-limiting, influenza-like illness that is
characterized by fever, headache, myalgia, and malaise. Natural human
infections with VS viruses are common throughout the tropical Americas.
Because the symptoms are nonspecific and the duration of illness is short,
most cases probably go unrecognized.
Epidemiologically, VS in animals occurs in both enzootic and epizootic
forms. Enzootic areas are characterized by subclinical infection in
domestic livestock, wildlife, and humans that can be detected through
serological surveys. Enzootic VSNJ and VSI occur in eastern Mexico,
Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, and Costa Rica, mostly in lowland tropical
areas. In the United States, a band of enzootic VSNJ formerly occurred in
the coastal plains of
South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida in the 1950s. Currently, only one
well-documented focus of enzootic VSNJ remains, on Ossabaw Island, Georgia.
In more temperate areas, VS tends to occur as epizootics. As a general
rule, epizootics have tended to occur with decreasing frequency and
increasing magnitude with increasing latitude in both North and South
America. Epizootics have been spectacular in appearance, and consequently
most studies of VS
have been conducted during or immediately following epizootics.
In the United States, major epizootics of VSI occurred in 1942, 1956,
1964, and 1965 and have only occurred in western states. Major epizootics
of VSNJ occurred in 1944, 1949, 1957, 1959, 1963, 1982-83, 1985, and 1995,
and have extended as far north as Canada. In the United States, major
outbreaks have the following features: (1) they tend to occur at sporadic
intervals;
(2) they begin in late spring or early summer months; (3) clinical cases
follow natural drainages, but can spread to distant areas while excluding
large populations of susceptible animals; and (4) outbreaks cease with the
onset of frosts. The origin of epizootics is not understood, and it is not
known
whether silent enzootic foci exist which occasionally give rise to
epizootics or whether viruses are periodically reintroduced into areas from
which they have been absent for long periods. Wind-borne carriage of
infected biting flies northward from sites of VS activity in Mexico has
been postulated as a means whereby the viruses gain entry into areas in the
United States where VS
is not enzootic.
Both VSI and VSNJ have been isolated from a wide variety of biting and
non-biting insects, yet vector competency has rarely been demonstrated.
Despite intensive studies, vertebrate amplifying hosts (those that
circulate virus in sufficient quantities to infect biting vector species)
have never been
identified. How vectors become infected in nature in sufficient quantities
to initiate and maintain epizootics is not yet known.
Field and laboratory investigations have shown that sand flies of the
genus _Lutzomyia_ (Diptera: Psychodidae) possibly serve as reservoir hosts
as well as vectors for VSI in Panama and for VSNJ on Ossabaw Island,
Georgia. Sand flies have been shown to transmit both viruses
transovarially in the laboratory, which is considered to be evidence of a
long evolutionary relationship. Isolates of VSNJ of high titer have been
made from pools of
wild-caught male sand flies, which, because males do not feed on vertebrate
blood, has been interpreted as evidence of transovarial transmission.
Together, these observations suggest that sand flies may be reservoir hosts
of the viruses in addition to serving as vectors.
VSNJ virus has been isolated in high titer from pools of black flies
_Simulium_ collected in Colorado during the 1982 epizootic, suggesting that
black flies may also be involved as biological vectors.
Other forms of transmission of VS viruses are likely to be important under
certain conditions. A large number of isolations of VSNJ virus from
muscoid flies in Colorado in 1982 suggests that mechanical transmission by
non-biting flies may occur. Contact transmission from infected to
uninfected vertebrates has been demonstrated experimentally, but the
importance of this type of spread under natural conditions has not been
determined.
The epidemiology of VS viruses has been difficult to elucidate because of
the inability to identify suitable vertebrate amplifying hosts and because
transovarial transmission alone does not seem to be sufficient to maintain
infection in the vector populations. As a result, there has been
speculation that VS viruses are plant viruses, but there has been no
convincing evidence presented to support this hypothesis. Another
hypothesis suggests that VS viruses are stabilized in their insect vectors
(100% efficiency in transovarial transmission) and that vertebrates merely
represent dead-end hosts for the viruses.
The 1997 outbreak of VS in the western United States is unusual in that
both VSI and VSNJ viruses currently are present. To the best of our
knowledge, these viruses use different vector-host systems. Therefore, it
is likely that the present outbreak actually represents two independent
outbreaks occurring
simultaneously. If this is the case, a rare opportunity exists to study
the ecology of these viruses as the epizootics unfold.
