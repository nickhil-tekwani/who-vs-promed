A parasitic disease, canine echinococcosis, has increased in Chile's Tierra del Fuego province [Magallanes y Antartica Chilena] after a governmental dog deworming program was cancelled in 2004, according to a study from the University of California, Davis' One Health Institute and School of Veterinary Medicine.

The study, published in the journal Zoonoses and Public Health [see below], was conducted in collaboration with the Universidad de Chile and the Wildlife Conservation Society-Chile. It notes this zoonotic disease can significantly impact people. Cystic echinococcosis - also known as hydatid disease -- affects more than 1 million people worldwide and is the 2nd most common cause of human deaths from parasitic disease in Chile.

It is caused by the tapeworm _Echinococcus granulosus_ which is shed by [and infected] dogs and can infect people. Dogs acquire the disease by consuming viscera of infected animals, such as sheep, making it prevalent in sheep farms and rural communities.

The deworming program had reduced the prevalence of the disease in dogs in sheep farms from Chile's Tierra del Fuego province from 68.4 percent in 1978 to 1.2 percent in 2002. The study found without the intensive program, canine echinococcosis has increased to 6.9 percent, as of 2016.

"This study points to a persistent risk of echinococcosis in domestic dogs at ranches in Tierra del Fuego, where sheep farming is the main economic activity," said corresponding author Marcela Uhart, director of the Latin America Program within the UC Davis One Health Institute. "It highlights the need to reestablish Chile's program to prevent this disease's reemergence as a significant public health concern."

Sheep, foxes, and other factors
------------------------------
For the study, researchers sampled 356 domestic dogs and interviewed owners and workers at 45 sheep ranches across Tierra del Fuego. They conducted dog fecal sample testing to detect the disease at Universidad de Chile's School of Veterinary Medicine in Santiago.

They found that the prevalence of canine echinococcus was higher on ranches where interviewees reported infrequent deworming. The number of sheep, frequency of sheep slaughter, feeding dogs with sheep viscera, and other ranch operational characteristics also influenced the prevalence of tapeworm eggs.

Infection prevalence was also associated with reports of presence of culpeo foxes. All canids present on the island, including the native culpeo and the introduced chilla foxes, are known to be hosts of the disease.

Abstract
--------
Hydatid disease is a neglected zoonotic parasitic disease caused by cysts of the tapeworm _Echinococcus granulosus_. Canids, especially domestic dogs, are definitive hosts of the parasite and are the most pragmatic targets for control programs. A governmental dog deworming campaign was established in 1979 to control hydatidosis in southern Chile, which succeeded in reducing the prevalence of canine echinococcosis in Tierra del Fuego province from 68.4% (in 1978) to 1.2% (in 2002). In 2004, however, the program was dismantled to reduce costs, and since then, no follow-up echinococcosis monitoring has been conducted.

We surveyed 356 domestic dogs and interviewed owners or workers at 45 ranches in Chilean Tierra del Fuego during the summer of 2015-2016. Faecal flotation was employed to detect Taeniidae eggs, and PCR was used to test faecal samples for _E. granulosus_. Taeniidae eggs and _Echinococcus_ sp. DNA were detected in the faeces of 45.4% (147/324) and 6.9% (23/331) of dogs, respectively. Infrequent dog deworming and the presence of culpeo foxes (_Lycalopex culpaeus_) were significant predictors of the prevalence of _Echinococcus_ sp. DNA and Taeniidae eggs.

Furthermore, the presence of introduced chilla foxes (_L. griseus_), the municipality, and several operational characteristics of ranches (number of sheep, frequency of sheep slaughter, number of dogs, frequency of removal of dog faeces, feeding of dogs with sheep viscera) were also predictive of the prevalence of Taeniidae eggs. Our findings reveal an ongoing risk of echinococcosis with pathogen maintenance in ranch dogs in Chilean Tierra del Fuego, and in the absence of adequate control programmes, there is a tangible risk of re-emergence of hydatid disease as a public health concern.

Impacts
-------
Cystic echinococcosis, or hydatidosis, is a zoonotic parasitic disease that affects more than 1 million people worldwide and is the 2nd most common cause of human deaths from parasitic disease in Chile.

A governmental dog deworming programme to control the disease in southern Chile succeeded in reducing the prevalence of canine echinococcosis in Tierra del Fuego province from 68.4% (in 1978) to 1.2% (in 2002).

Without the control programme, which was discontinued in 2004, the prevalence of canine echinococcosis appears to have increased to 6.9% (in 2015-2016), highlighting the need to re-establish government action to reduce this public health hazard.

["Echinococcosis is a parasitic disease caused by infection with tiny tapeworms of the genus _Echinococcus_. Echinococcosis is classified as either cystic echinococcosis or alveolar echinococcosis.

"Cystic echinococcosis (CE), also known as hydatid disease, is caused by infection with the larval stage of _E. granulosus, a ~2-7 millimeter long tapeworm found in dogs (definitive host) and sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs (intermediate hosts). Although most infections in humans are asymptomatic, CE causes harmful, slowly enlarging cysts in the liver, lungs, and other organs that often grow unnoticed and neglected for years.

"Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) disease is caused by infection with the larval stage of _E. multilocularis_, a ~1-4 millimeter long tapeworm found in foxes, coyotes, and dogs (definitive hosts). Small rodents are intermediate hosts for _E. multilocularis_. Although cases of AE in animals in endemic areas are relatively common, human cases are rare. AE poses a much greater health threat to people than CE, causing parasitic tumors that can form in the liver, lungs, brain, and other organs. If left untreated, AE can be fatal."

"In the past, surgery was the only treatment for cystic echinococcal cysts. Chemotherapy, cyst puncture, and PAIR (percutaneous aspiration, injection of chemicals and respiration) have been used to replace surgery as effective treatments for cystic echinococcosis. However, surgery remains the most effective treatment to remove the cyst and can lead to a complete cure. Some cysts are not causing any symptoms and are inactive; those cysts often go away without any treatment.

"The treatment of alveolar echinococcosis is more difficult than cystic echinococcosis and usually requires radical surgery, long-term chemotherapy, or both."

"Persons with cystic echinococcosis often remain asymptomatic until hydatid cysts containing the larval parasites grow large enough to cause discomfort, pain, nausea, and vomiting. The cysts grow over the course of several years before reaching maturity and the rate at which symptoms appear typically depends on the location of the cyst. The cysts are mainly found in the liver and lungs but can also appear in the spleen, kidneys, heart, bone, and central nervous system, including the brain and eyes. Cyst rupture is most frequently caused by trauma and may cause mild to severe anaphylactic reactions, even death, as a result of the release of cystic fluid.

"Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is characterized by parasitic tumors in the liver and may spread to other organs including the lungs and brain. In humans, the larval forms of E. multilocularis do not fully mature into cysts but cause vesicles that invade and destroy surrounding tissues and cause discomfort or pain, weight loss, and malaise. AE can cause liver failure and death because of the spread into nearby tissues and, rarely, the brain. AE is a dangerous disease resulting in a mortality rate between 50% and 75%, especially because most affected people live in remote locations and have poor health care."

"Cystic echinococcosis is controlled by preventing transmission of the parasite. Prevention measures include limiting the areas where dogs are allowed and preventing animals from consuming meat infected with cysts.
- Prevent dogs from feeding on the carcasses of infected sheep.
- Control stray dog populations.
- Restrict home slaughter of sheep and other livestock.
- Do not consume any food or water that may have been contaminated by fecal matter from dogs.
- Wash your hands with soap and warm water after handling dogs, and before handling food.
- Teach children the importance of washing hands to prevent infection.

"Alveolar echinococcosis can be prevented by avoiding contact with wild animals such as foxes, coyotes, and dogs and their fecal matter and by limiting the interactions between dogs and rodent populations.
- Do not allow dogs to feed on rodents and other wild animals.
- Avoid contact with wild animals such as foxes, coyotes and stray dogs.
- Do not encourage wild animals to come close to your home or keep them as pets.
- Wash your hands with soap and warm water after handling dogs or cats, and before handling food.
- Teach children the importance of washing hands to prevent infection."

Knowing the disease and how it spreads, including the pain and health consequences, it seems like it would be better to prevent this disease at all levels. Treating the dogs on a regular basis would decrease the shedding of this parasite and increase the health and comfort for the dog as well as decrease human exposure. Also, regular deworming for other animals such as sheep is also beneficial. - Mod.TG
