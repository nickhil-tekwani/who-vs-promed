Province on rabies alert
------------------------
A 3 year old boy from Umlazi was close to becoming the 4th victim of rabies in the province following an outbreak of the disease that has killed 3 people in the past month. The toddler has been at the Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital for the past 2 weeks and, according to the department of environmental affairs, is showing signs of recovery. "We have been in contact with his mother since he was admitted to hospital and she says there are improvements. He can now sit and has started swallowing liquids. He also responds when she calls his name but he still cannot speak properly," said department spokesperson Jeffrey Zikhali.

On Friday [8 Jun 2012], the 1st reported victim of rabies in the province died after 5 weeks in a critical condition. The 29 year old farmer and well-known canoeist's condition had deteriorated to the point where he was pronounced brain dead, forcing his family to agree that he be taken off life-support machines. The family's spokesperson, Dr Grant Lindsey, said a decision on the funeral or memorial service had not yet been made. "Right now everybody is gathered here at the farm -- family, friends, and neighbours. His mother had been there for him from the time he was admitted in hospital; she never left him. The whole family is devastated right now," he said. Lindsey went on to say that if anything, the victim's case had raised awareness and created a massive campaign against rabies, attracting attention from the World Health Organization and the government departments.

Last month [May 2012], an 8 year old child was buried at his home in eMaswazini, Bergville. He was the 2nd to die of rabies after a 52 year old mother of 4 died a week earlier. They had both been bitten by dogs. Both funerals were attended by agriculture MEC Meshack Radebe.

Last week [week of 4 Jun 2012], Radebe launched a Rand 1 million [about USD 118 000] roll-out strategy in a bid to prevent new infections. "We are embarking on radio, television, and newspaper campaigns to run adverts, alerting our people about rabies. Just for this massive media awareness campaign, the department will be spending almost Rand 1 million. Lives are worth more," said Radebe at the launch in Durban on Thursday [7 Jun 2012]. He went on to say there should be a way of "marking" all vaccinated dogs and cats, so if one decided to play with a pet, they would know if it had been vaccinated or not.

"We are also working together with the department of education, which has agreed to let children go home and collect pets on vaccination days in their communities. We are also in talks with municipalities and metros in the province to get more manpower to help with more vaccinations and also take the message to grassroots level."

KwaZulu-Natal [KZN] is in the grip of the most serious outbreak of the dread disease rabies in years, according to the farming community of Bergville/Winterton in the KZN Midlands. Vets in the area have euthanased at least 50 rabid dogs in the past few weeks, and each dog might have been in contact with an unknown number of people who could now be facing a certain death sentence. If treatment is not initiated soon after exposure, the rabies virus enters the nervous system and kills its host. Rabies has been under the spotlight since a 29 year old Underberg farmer, was diagnosed with it just over 5 weeks ago. He died at the Pietermaritzburg Medi-Clinic on Friday afternoon [8 Jun 2012]. He reportedly contracted the disease from a stray dog.

Farmers and vets told the Tribune that while representatives of the Department of Agriculture and Environmental Affairs used to make regular visits and were strict about enforcing the law that all dogs must be vaccinated annually, the programme had petered out in recent years. They insist the situation would not have reached crisis point if due vigilance had been observed. "The excuse we are given is lack of funds," said Bergville vet Dr Jubie Muller. "That just does not hold water. Vaccination campaigns are vital here, because our area is widespread and fairly inaccessible, so many people can't bring their dogs to town to have them vaccinated. I have put down 7 rabies-positive dogs lately, and am awaiting the results of tests on others. This does not take into account all the rabid animals that farmers are shooting on their farms. Together with vets at other practices, there have been over 50 confirmed cases in our area since February [2012].

"Reason tells us that there are a lot of people out there who are incubating the virus. The deaths we have seen so far are only going to be the tip of the iceberg." Jeffrey Zikhali, spokesman for the KZN Department of Agriculture, confirmed that there had been 3 human deaths from rabies in the past month: an 8 year old child who died at the Emmaus Hospital in Bergville, a 52 year old man, who died in Durban but is believed to have contracted the disease in the Winterton/Bergville area, and the 29 year old farmer. Muller said that ignorance about how rabies presents itself, and the ease with which it spreads, would contribute to many more deaths unless public awareness was made a priority, and more government resources were deployed.

"There are 2 strains [that is, presentations] of rabies. Dogs can either be extremely aggressive, or very passive, with signs of paralysis and a jaw that hangs open. In the 2nd example, the animals' owners often mistakenly think the dog has something stuck in its throat, and will probe for the suspected object, putting them at risk of infection."

Earlier this week a dog was brought to Muller in a taxi full of people. "Every effort is being made to track all those it came into contact with, but there is no telling if we will find them all," he said. A young Winterton farmer's wife and mother recently escaped death after being nipped by a rabid puppy. Although she is a medical professional, she had no idea the animal was infected until she was alerted by the vet who put the dog down. "The pup belonged to my neighbours and I saw it running down the road, looking terrified. I now realise that in fact it had the mania characteristic of full-blown rabies," she told the Tribune. "I loaded it into my car and didn't turn a hair when it lunged at me. I just dropped it off at home."

[It would seem that it has taken the death of a famous sportsperson to draw attention to the high risk of human rabies virus infection in the province.
