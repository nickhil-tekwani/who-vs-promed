From: Marion Warwick <WarwiM@mail.health.state.mo.us>

We are currently investigating two clusters of cyclosporiasis cases,
associated with events that were catered by different establishments in two
counties on July 24. The clusters appear to be associated with consumption
of the same type of fresh produce, which was not a fruit or berry. Because
the food items included several types of fresh produce, the specific
vehicle has not yet been definitively identified, nor is it known yet how
widely it could have been distributed.
