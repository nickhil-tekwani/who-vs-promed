_Giardia_ and _Cryptosporidium_, the two pathogens that caused a
contamination scare a fortnight ago, were found on Thursday in water
leaving the Prospect Filtration Plant which services most of Sydney's water
supply. The traces of cryptosporidia were at a level which Sydney Water had
previously stated was "unacceptable".
An internal memo from senior managers at Sydney Water reveals that a joint
decision was made by the Health Department and Sydney Water on Thursday not
to alert the public of the contamination. Following inquiries from The
Telegraph yesterday, the Health Department issued a media alert confirming
the test results. But it said the latest contamination did not pose a
threat to public health. That memo states that at 7.45am on Thursday,
Sydney Water was advised by the operators of the Prospect Filtration Plant
that cryptosporidia and giardia had been detected.
The most recent giardia level was 20 occysts per 100 litres while the
cryptosporidia were 50 occysts per 100 litres. Sydney Water spokesman Rod
Metcalfe said recently that a giardia level of 10 occysts was
"unacceptable". During the July water scare when 3.5 million people
throughout Sydney were warned to boil their water, the giardia level was
300 and the cryptosporidium level was 50. A level of 100 is considered to
cause infection in a healthy person although lower levels could be
potentially hazardous to anyone who is ill or suffering from
immune-deficiency diseases. Normal readings for both bugs are regarded by
experts to be zero.
The memo says that at 4:40 PM on Thursday a conference call was held
between Sydney Water and the Health Department. "After lengthy discussions
about the results, senior health officials including Andrew Wilson, chief
health officer, decided that no further action was necessary at this stage
and no precautionary media alerts should be issued at this time," the memo
says.
A Sydney Water source said last night that serious questions were now being
raised about the $300 million Prospect Filtration Plant which was designed
to provide the safest drinking water in the world.
The newspaper revealed earlier this week that the independent panel set up
to investigate the contamination in July found that four major failures of
chemical treatment at the plant were responsible.
The Health Department said last night that follow-up tests at Prospect
showed the water at the plant was now clear of giardia and cryptosporidia.
