Oregon has reported five confirmed cases and one presumptive case of
_Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ so far in the summer of 1998. All the cases have
been investigated. We have found, only in those cases in which a definitive
source of the oysters could be obtained, that mostly the source of the
oysters to be from Washington State.
The Department of Agriculture, Food Safety Division, Shellfish Program
surveys the commercial oyster beds on a regular basis. Results of the
latest round of sampling for _V. parahaemolyticus_ in the six shellfish
growing areas being monitored in Oregon. All sites monitored from July 27
through August 2 ranged between 3 to 20 MPN for _V. parahaemolyticus_.
There was an elevated level of 220 MPN from So[uth Slough, harvested
7/13/98, during the second round; then a resample 7/27 of 20. The latest
from So Slough, collected August 2nd, was 3 MPN.
Oregon Department of Agriculture issued a Preventive Measures Memo for _V.
parahaemolyticus_ to all Oregon shellfish dealers on July 27, 1998.
Recommended control measures included cooling shellstock to 45*F within 4
hrs of harvest.
