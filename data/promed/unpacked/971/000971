[1] Antarctica: Princess Elizabeth Polar station
Date: Wed 29 Dec 2021

Two-thirds of the staff currently based in the Princess Elisabeth Polar Station in Antarctica have been infected with COVID-19, even though very strict health measures were put in place. Despite being located in one of the most remote places in the world, 2/3 of the station's total 25 staff members have been infected. No severe symptoms have been reported as of yet, the Belgian Polar Secretariat confirmed to Le Soir Mag.

All staff members preparing to depart to the station had to undergo a PCR test in Belgium 2 hours before leaving for South Africa, and take a PCR test 5 days after their arrival in Cape Town, where they also had to quarantine for 10 days. Another test was required when leaving Cape Town for Antarctica, and another PCR test had to be undergone 5 days after arrival.

Despite the strict measures, one positive case was detected on 14 Dec [2021] among a group of people who had arrived at the base 7 days earlier, and although this person was immediately placed in isolation, tests revealed that 2 others had also contracted the virus. All 3 people were evacuated on 23 Dec [2021], but the virus continued to circulate. According to a virologist consulted by the Polar Secretariat, there is a high probability that the infection at the station is due to the omicron variant, given that it accounts for 99% of the cases in South Africa, which would explain the rapid circulation.

Two emergency doctors are on-site, and the station has all the necessary equipment to treat the staff and carry out PCR tests. According to Hubert, all polar stations open in Antarctica are currently affected by the circulation of the virus within bases.

The Polar Secretariat's Strategic Council decided on Monday [27 Dec 2021] to keep the staff in the station but will forbid any new entry into the station before the cluster disappears and, at the very least, until 12 Jan, [2022] when 2 new expeditions are expected to arrive. The research season will also be shortened.

[Princess Elisabeth station is operated by the International Polar Foundation and went into service in 2009.

It isn't the 1st time research stations in Antarctica have been affected by a coronavirus outbreak. In December 2020, a number of Chilean military personnel based at Bernardo O'Higgins research station were infected after sailors on a supply ship tested positive for the virus (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-55410065).]

[2] Omicron spreading
Date: 31 Dec 2021
Source: National Public Radio [edited]
https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2021/12/31/1067702355/omicron-is-spreading-like-wildfire-scientists-are-trying-to-figure-out-why


In late November [2021], more than 110 people gathered at a crowded Christmas party at a restaurant in Oslo, Norway. Most of the guests were fully vaccinated. One had returned from South Africa just a few days earlier and was unknowingly carrying the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. Ultimately, about 70% of the partygoers were infected. Scientists who traced this superspreader event concluded it was evidence that omicron was "highly transmissible" among fully vaccinated adults.

Just over a month later, omicron's speedy worldwide ascent shows that the party wasn't an isolated example. In country after country, the new variant has outperformed its predecessor, the delta variant, with one case of omicron sparking at least 3 other new infections on average. Cases have soared to record highs in parts of Europe and now the US, where about half a million new infections have been recorded in a single day.

"This is a game-changing virus, especially in the vaccinated population where people have had a level of invincibility," says Sumit Chanda, a professor in the Department of Immunology and Microbiology at Scripps Research. Indeed, in a world where vaccinations and infections have built up immunity, other variants were having trouble gaining a foothold. Yet omicron is thriving. "This changes the calculus for everybody," says Chanda.

What accounts for omicron's lightning-quick spread? So far, omicron's best trick is dodging our immunity: the antibodies and other immune defenses put on by the body after vaccination and/or prior infection. The variant's many mutations on the spike protein allow it to infect human cells more efficiently than previous variants, leaving many more people again vulnerable. Because of that, "immune escape" alone could be the major reason why the variant looks so contagious compared with delta, which was already highly transmissible.

Omicron has been spreading at a pace comparable to the original strain of the coronavirus at the very beginning of the pandemic, despite the world's newfound levels of immunity. "The playing field for the virus right now is quite different than it was in the early days," says Dr Joshua Schiffer, an infectious disease researcher at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. "The majority of variants we've seen to date couldn't survive in this immune environment." Even delta was essentially at a "tie," he says, where it was persisting, but "not growing very rapidly or decreasing very rapidly."

A new study from Denmark suggests that much of the variant's dominance comes down to its ability to evade the body's immune defenses. Researchers compared the spread of omicron and of delta among members of the same household and concluded that omicron is 2.7-3.7 times more infectious than the delta variant among vaccinated and boosted individuals.

For unvaccinated people, however, there was no significant difference in rates of infection between delta and omicron. That would indicate that both variants are about at the same level of transmissibility among the unvaccinated. In other words, under those circumstances, omicron is not necessarily more transmissible than delta. If confirmed, the findings would support the idea that omicron's increased transmissibility can be ascribed to its "immune evasiveness", not some other characteristics that make the variant inherently more transmissible, the authors conclude.

This is also what a small study from the University of Maryland may hint at, although here, too, the findings are preliminary and yet to be peer-reviewed. Researchers measured how much virus that vaccinated people who were infected with omicron were releasing into the air after shouting and singing. Four out of the 5 were exhaling ample amounts of virus into the air, comparable to the amount shed by unvaccinated people earlier in the pandemic. "But what's striking is that I was expecting to see the amounts to be much higher, and they are not," says Dr Don Milton, an infectious disease aerobiologist at the University of Maryland School of Public Health, who led the study.

The findings suggest that the spread of omicron could hinge, in part, on the fact that more vaccinated people are contagious and shedding virus, not necessarily that each infected individual is releasing a lot more virus into the air. And if the results hold true, Milton says long-distance transmission is unlikely to become a new concern with omicron, above and beyond what's already been seen with other contagious variants like delta. "With measles, for example, the source strength is just so intense that even in the next room, people are still at risk of getting infected," he says. "And you don't see much of that with this virus" because it gets so diluted by the time it reaches the next room.

But there is a downside. Says Milton: "The bad news is the vaccine doesn't mean you're not going to transmit it to somebody else." And he adds that the findings are ultimately limited to those who are vaccinated: "Maybe you get an unvaccinated person, it [the amount of virus] is a whole lot more intense."

With so many mutations, it's still possible that omicron has additional advantages that make it more contagious than other variants, advantages that rely on more than breaking through our prior immunity. Can omicron produce more copies of itself in a cell? Or stick to cells more effectively? Is it better at hanging in the air and staying infectious? "Any of those things would make the virus more contagious," says Schiffer of Fred Hutchinson.

One key difference emerging with omicron is how quickly someone who gets infected becomes contagious. Omicron appears to have a shorter incubation period, and that can substantially speed up infections across the population. A study of the Oslo Christmas party outbreak found the incubation period could be about 3 days, compared with 4.3 days for delta and 5 days for other variants (https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.50.2101147). A small study from CDC also puts the incubation period at about 3 days (http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm705152e3). "That's actually a fairly significant difference," says Schiffer. This would mean there are many more cycles of infections and less time for people who are exposed to take precautions not to expose others.

A mid-December [2021] study from Hong Kong has also led scientists to consider that omicron may indeed replicate better in certain cells and therefore have a leg-up against delta, at least among the unvaccinated. Researchers found that omicron multiplied about 70 times faster than delta did in tissue samples from the bronchus, the large airways that lead from the trachea to the lungs. Meanwhile, omicron had much more trouble infecting cells in lung tissue than the original version of the coronavirus that was first identified in Wuhan, China (https://www.med.hku.hk/en/news/press/20211215-omicron-sars-cov-2-infection?utm_medium= social&utm_source= twitter&utm_campaign=press_release).

"Potentially you could be shedding more virus in your upper respiratory tract than you would be if most of the replication was happening deep in your lungs," says Angie Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. Like other variants, omicron spreads from the nose and mouth through respiratory droplets at close range and through virus particles that float through the air and can stay suspended for quite a while, especially in places with poor ventilation. Rasmussen says this data on faster replication in the bronchus tissue "would suggest you might have more virus in those respiratory secretions, which can come out either as mucus if you have a runny nose or certainly can be exhaled as aerosols and droplets."

If omicron does spread more easily through the air, this faster replication in the bronchus would be one of the 2 most likely explanations, says Linsey Marr, a professor of engineering at Virginia Tech who studies how viruses transmit in the air. "Infected people are either releasing a lot more virus particles into the air, or you can breathe in fewer of them and still become infected, or some combination of those," she says.

While that Hong Kong study focused on what happens in the lab, a cautionary tale of omicron spreading through the air has also emerged from an isolation facility there. In a report published in early December [2021], Hong Kong scientists describe how a traveler in quarantine at a hotel had infected a person staying across the hallway but never actually had face-to-face contact. "Airborne transmission across the corridor" is the most probable explanation, the authors conclude (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34860154/). "That suggests a very small amount of the virus was able to cause an infection," says Dr Michael Klompas, an infectious disease physician and hospital epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital. This could mean that omicron requires a smaller dose than previous variants to infect people, although there's no data yet to establish whether that is true, he says.

While concerning, such early anecdotes need to be interpreted carefully. There are similar instances of airborne transmission with delta, and hotels and other places repurposed to isolate infected travelers are difficult places to turn into quarantine facilities. "Can we catch omicron more easily through the air than other variants? I don't think that's known," says Rasmussen. "What is very clear is that you can catch it more easily, period."

Despite the many unanswered questions about why omicron is so contagious, scientists say it's important to realize that the coronavirus has not morphed into an entirely new virus. "The rules haven't changed; it's just the margin for error has got a lot smaller," says Klompas. When it comes to minimizing your personal risk, the same principles apply: Wear a high-quality mask like an N95, choose outdoors over indoors if possible, and avoid large gatherings with unmasked people, especially if they are not vaccinated. "These risk-reduction measures are additive, and you should try to apply as many of them as possible," says Rasmussen.

Even quick face-to-face interactions appear to be riskier with omicron, in part because people have relied on the vaccines as their only layer of defense, says Chanda. "If you walk into a room full of people and someone is infected, the chances have dramatically increased that you will get the virus," whether you're vaccinated or boosted or not.

[It is interesting that these investigators found that unvaccinated individuals were equally susceptible to the delta and omicron variants (that is, the 2 variants were equally transmissible to individuals lacking immunity). They conclude "omicron is not necessarily more transmissible than delta." They state this supports "the idea that omicron's increased transmissibility can be ascribed to its "immune evasiveness," not some other characteristics that make the variant inherently more transmissible." - Mod.LK]

[3] South Africa: hospitalization outcome

ref: Maslo C, Friedland R, Toubkin M, et al. Characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized patients in South Africa during the COVID-19 omicron wave compared with previous waves. JAMA Research Letter. 2021 [published online 30 Dec 2021]; doi: 10.1001/jama.2021.24868.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
On 24 Nov 2021, a SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern, omicron (B.1.1.529), was identified in South Africa as responsible for a 4th wave of COVID-19 (1,2). The high number of spike mutations has raised concerns about its ability to evade vaccine and spread (3,4). We assessed hospitalized patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result during the 4th wave compared with previous waves.

Results
------
The number of patients treated in the hospitals during the same early period of each wave differed (2351 in wave 4 vs maximum 6342 in wave 3); however, 68%-69% of patients presenting to the emergency department with a positive COVID-19 result were admitted to the hospital in the 1st 3 waves vs 41.3% in wave 4 (Table 1 See URL above for tables.). Patients hospitalized during wave 4 were younger (median age, 36 years vs maximum 59 years in wave 3; P < 0.001) with a higher proportion of females. Significantly fewer patients with comorbidities were admitted in wave 4, and the proportion presenting with an acute respiratory condition was lower (31.6% in wave 4 vs maximum 91.2% in wave 3, P < 0.001). Of 971 patients admitted in wave 4, 24.2% were vaccinated, 66.4% were unvaccinated, and vaccination status was unknown for 9.4%.

The proportion of patients requiring oxygen therapy significantly decreased (17.6% in wave 4 vs 74% in wave 3, P < 0.001) as did the percentage receiving mechanical ventilation (Table 2). Admission to intensive care was 18.5% in wave 4 vs 29.9% in wave 3 (P < 0.001).

The median LOS (between 7 and 8 days in previous waves) decreased to 3 days in wave 4. The death rate was between 19.7% in wave 1 and 29.1% in wave 3 and decreased to 2.7% in wave 4.

Discussion
------------
A different pattern of characteristics and outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was observed in the early phase of the 4th wave compared with earlier waves in South Africa, with younger patients having fewer comorbidities, fewer hospitalizations and respiratory diagnoses, and a decrease in severity and mortality.

The study has several limitations. First, patients' virus genotyping was not available. The omicron variant was estimated to be 81% of the variants isolated by November [2021] and 95% isolated by December 2021.4 Second, 7% of the patients were still hospitalized as of 20 Dec [2021]. Third, patients' behavior and the profile of admissions could have differed between waves as different national restrictions and lockdowns were implemented. These factors should not have affected urgent admissions. Fourth, patients admitted for COVID-19 could not be differentiated from asymptomatic patients admitted for other diagnoses with an incidental positive test result, and this likely differed between waves, suggested by the lower proportion admitted with respiratory diagnoses in wave 4.

Further research is needed to determine if the differences between waves are affected by preexisting acquired or natural immunity (44.3% of the adult South African population was vaccinated as of December 2021(5) and more than 50% of the population has had previous exposure to SARS-CoV-26) or if omicron may be less pathogenic than previous variants.

[4] China: case count
Date: Sat 1 Jan 2022
Source: Al Jazeera [edited]
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/1/1/update-3-china-ends-2021-with-worst-covid-week-since-taming-original-epidemic


China has started 2022 with its biggest tally of local coronavirus cases for any 7-day period since subduing the country's 1st epidemic nearly 2 years ago, despite an arsenal of some of the world's toughest COVID-19 measures. The National Health Commission reported on Saturday [1 Jan 2022] 175 new community infections with confirmed clinical symptoms for 31 Dec [2021], bringing the total number of local symptomatic cases in mainland China in the past week to 1151. The surge has been driven mostly by an outbreak in the north western industrial and tech hub of Xi'an, a city of 13 million.

The deepening outbreak in Xi'an will likely firm authorities' resolve to curb transmissions quickly as and when cases emerge. The city, under lockdown for 10 days as of Saturday [1 Jan 2022], has reported 1451 local symptomatic cases since 9 Dec [2021], the highest tally for any Chinese city in 2021.

The state-backed publication, China Daily, said that the capital of Shaanxi province, "is still facing a tough battle" against the outbreak, and that there is no "turning point" yet in containing the spread of the virus. Liu Guozhong, secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, said there should be a "sense of urgency in the fight against COVID-19 in the days to come". "Xi'an is the decisive destination in the fight against the pandemic, and only when the outbreak in Xi'an has been put under control can we fundamentally reverse the passive situation in the entire province," Liu was quoted by China Daily as saying.

While China's case count is tiny compared with many outbreaks elsewhere in the world, forestalling major flare-ups in 2022 will be important. Beijing will be hosting the Winter Olympic Games in February, [2022] and the ruling Communist Party will hold a once-every-5-years congress, expected in the autumn, where President Xi Jinping will likely secure a 3rd term as party secretary. In his new year address, Xi said China "will spare no efforts to present a great games to the world."

The emergence of the highly transmissible omicron variant will also drive Beijing to stick to its high vigilance against the virus. China has reported a handful of imported omicron cases and at least one locally transmitted case.

Since August [2021], China has tried to get any outbreak under control within about 2 weeks, much shorter than the 4-6 weeks in earlier battles against sporadic flare-ups following the initial nationwide epidemic, according to the National Health Commission. Cities along China's borders are at higher virus risk, either due to the presence of overland transport links or entry of infected travellers from other countries. Some were hit by delta outbreaks that resulted in harsh travel curbs last year [2021].

Yunnan, which shares a border with Myanmar, Laos, and Viet Nam, reported new local symptomatic cases on 92 out of 365 days last year [2021], or 25% of the time, more often than any other province, autonomous region or municipality. The Xi'an outbreak, which led to cases in other cities including Beijing, could be traced back to a flight arriving from Pakistan, but it was unclear how it spread to local communities.

Many people have been forbidden from leaving their residential compounds, but a city government official said on Friday [31 Dec 2021] curbs would be loosened in less risky compounds when the time was right. China's tough epidemic policies have helped stop its sprawling industrial sector from sliding into prolonged shutdowns, reaping important export gains as other pillars of growth weakened. But unpredictable disruptions have shaken consumer sentiment and hammered the catering, hospitality, and tourism sectors.

[In the past 24 hours, 20 countries -- France (219 126), the USA (168 019), the UK (162 572), Italy (141 256), Turkey (36 731), Canada (36 009), Australia (34 283), Greece (30 009), India (28 347), Portugal (23 290), Ireland (23 281), Argentina (20 020), Russia (19 751), Denmark(19 836), Germany (19 706), Belgium(15 686), the Netherlands (15 570), Viet Nam (14 835), Colombia (12 415), and Poland (12 033) -- all reported over 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 4398 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 30 Dec 2021 to late 31 Dec 2021).

The exponential rise in cases over the last couple of weeks can be attributed to the rapid increase in omicron variant cases in over 90 countries. Studies suggest that omicron variant causes milder disease than the previously dominant delta variant, but the large numbers of cases caused by this highly infectious/transmissible variant threaten to overwhelm hospitals and health systems. The major differences seen on account of testing delays over the holiday period will likely continue over the coming weekend; the rolling 7-day average is a more precise indicator to follow the trends of the pandemic, which indicate an increasing global trend on cases with some reduction in deaths.

A total of 69 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 40 of the 69 countries are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 5 are from the Western Pacific region, 2 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 are from the South East Asia region, and 10 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 86.9%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 4.6%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show an 85.6% increase in daily reported cases and 12.3% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: Over 1 100 000 newly confirmed infections were reported worldwide in the past 24 hours, with over 289.71 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.45 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
