Man detained on suspicion of killing 4 with poison
--------------------------------------------------
Last Supper: The suspect in the 4 murders was reportedly the jilted
lover of a woman who, with her husband and another couple, drank
poison wine. Police in Nantou County yesterday [22 Aug 2011] detained
a man suspected of killing 4 people by adding 2-chloroethanol to their
rice wine. Nantou County judges yesterday (22 Aug 2011) ordered the
detention of a man suspected of murdering 2 couples in an Aboriginal
village with poison.

Lin Ching-yi, 55, his wife Wang Mei-yung, 48, and another couple
living in an Aboriginal village in Sinyi Township, Nantou County, died
after dining together at Lin's home on 15 Jul 2011.

Announcing they had solved the case, investigators said the 4 victims
had a look of pain on their faces and had myosis, a condition where
the pupil constricts abnormally, usually following the consumption of
drugs. Investigators said they suspected the victims had ingested
neurotoxins contained in the food or wine.

Investigators said residents in the Aboriginal villages panicked after
the incident. For a while, homemade alcohol, pigsties and well water
were considered possible sources of the unknown poison. Local police
visited households in the area and told residents to avoid drinking or
eating anything suspicious.

Nantou prosecutors said they had a breakthrough after they found that
Wang had had a former boyfriend named Chu Ming-fu.

Prosecutors arrested Chu on Saturday. Prosecutors said Chu had
confessed to poisoning Wang and her husband. Prosecutors said Chu told
them he and Wang dated last year. However, after he moved to Pingtung
County for work, Wang married Lin in February. Chu allegedly told
investigators he resented it and decided to take revenge.

Chu told prosecutors that on 30 Jun 2011 he gave Wang 6 bottles of
rice wine, adding that he had poured 10 mililiters of 2-chloroethanol
in one bottle.

Prosecutors said that 2-chloroethanol was a highly toxic substance
that could cause death if even a very small amount was ingested.

Prosecutors said forensics experts discovered traces of
2-chloroethanol in the victims' bodies, but that initially they did
not believe the substance had caused their deaths.

[2-chloroethanol is a colorless liquid that is miscible in both water
and alcohol. It has pleasant mild ether-like odor. It is possible that
either smell or taste would not have been noticed in the wine. The
irritation it produces in the eyes, and lungs may not have been enough
to cause concern in the individuals until it was too late.

2-chloroethanol is very toxic. It may be fatal when inhaled,
swallowed, or absorbed through the skin. It can be irritating to eyes,
skin and lungs, but the irritation is weak and is not strong enough to
warn of a potentially fatal exposure.

Exposure to 2-chloroethanol can cause damage to the central nervous
system, cardiovascular system. the kidneys and the liver. It
decomposes in fire to yield hydrogen chloride and phosgene, which are
irritating, toxic and potentially fatal. 2-chloroethanol reacts
violently with oxidants and is a fire and explosion hazard. It reacts
with water or steam to produce toxic and corrosive fumes. It reacts
with strong bases to produce ethylene oxide, which is both toxic and a
fire hazard.

[The story continues to be confusing. In the 1st report (see below),
a neurotoxin was suspected; in the 2nd report, botulism was suspected,
now both botulism and 2-chloroethanol are suspected. Clarification of
this event would be gratefully appreciated.
