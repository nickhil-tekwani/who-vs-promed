New strain of rhizomania spreading
-----------------------------------
United Kingdom sugar beet crops face the twin threat of a new, highly
localised strain of rhizomania which can overcome varietal resistance
plus the re-emergence of virus yellows.

Mark Stevens of Broom's Barn outlined how the new strain was being
closely monitored, after its discovery in 2008. The changed strain was
originally found in half-a-dozen fields in Suffolk, but has since
spread to Essex, probably by soil movement, he said. "There were a
further 4 cases of this new strain, known as AYPW, confirmed in 2009,"
notes Dr Stevens. "The affected crops display strong leaf and
root-madness symptoms."

The fact that the new strain can overcome resistance is a concern, he
admitted. "In 2010, half of the varieties planted will be resistant
types. We've seen that sugars are reduced by 3-4 percent by this new
strain." Susceptible varieties could be killed, he warned.

In contrast, virus yellows is not a new disease. But it was a
re-emerging threat, despite that fact that 90 percent of the UK
sugarbeet crop receives an effective seed treatment. Climate change,
uncertainty about the future of some pesticides and the threat of
[vector] resistances to neonicotinoid insecticide seed treatments
could all make virus yellows a concern again, he suggested. "Warmer
winters work in favour of the main aphid vector, _Myzus persicae_," he
said.

Without seed treatments, growers would be reliant on foliar sprays,
most of which the peach aphid already has some resistance to, said Dr.
Stevens. "This would make us reliant on integrated strategies in the
future. There's no major single source of resistance in the germplasm,
but GM crops do offer an opportunity to introduce virus resistance."

[Rhizomania is one of the most serious diseases of sugarbeet
worldwide. It is caused by _Beet necrotic yellow vein virus_ (BNYVV;
genus _ Benyvirus_) which is spread by the fungus-like root parasite
_Polymyxa betae_. Symptoms include excessive production of roots,
distortion and discolouration of roots, as well as chlorosis and
distortion of leaves. Root size and sugar yield is severely reduced.
The vector, and with it the virus, is easily spread with contaminated
soil to new fields. It survives for decades in the soil as cysts which
can release zoospores carring infectious virus when water becomes
available. Disease management includes cultural practices and genetic
resistance. BNYVV has been included on the quarantine list of the
European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

Virus yellows is an important disease affecting yield in sugarbeet in
the UK and elsewhere. The beet yellows complex may include one or
several viruses. In the UK, the main viruses involved are _Beet
yellows virus_ (BYV; genus _Closterovirus_), _Beet mild yellowing
virus_ (BMYV; genus _Polerovirus_) and _Beet chlorosis virus_ (BChV;
genus _Polerovirus_). These viruses are transmitted by aphids,
including the peach aphid (_Myzus persicae_). Disease management
usually includes phytosanitation as well as vector control by field
applications and seed treatments with insecticides. Resistance
breeding for multiple pathogens is difficult because host
susceptibility is likely to involve different genes for the different
pathogens.
