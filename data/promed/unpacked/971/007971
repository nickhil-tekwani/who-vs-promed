1. The incubation period for BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, mad cow
disease) is not a precise "5-years", but rather a distribution of values
from 2 to 20 years, depending on dosage and susceptibility.
2. The possibility of a "third method" of transmitting BSE has not been
investigated to date, so it can not be ruled out. But on the other hand, so
far there is also no evidence mandating its presence.
3. The position on maternal transmission is based on a single, incomplete
UK (United Kingdom)government study of small-scale, in which Dickenson's
hypothesis instead of maternal transmission could not be ruled out.
The questions that should have been asked are:
1. Why is a study such as Dickenson is proposing been postponed so long
(i.e., not been done before), and why is it received so hostilely?
2. Why was the "maternal transmission" study not repeated on larger-scale,
since it seems to be a lynch-pin in the UK MAFFs (Ministry Agriculture
Foods and Fisheries) position on BSE?
3. Why has there been no prion-testing surveillance of the UK food animal
herd to place bounds on current incidence of BSE?
The scientific handling of BSE and the associated nvCJD (new variant
Cruezefelt-Jakob Disease) epidemic are a strong cautionary tale case study
of the effects of politics in emerging disease.

[Robert asks some excellent questions. Is there is someone with
authoritative answers to these questions? Otherwise this thread is cut. -
