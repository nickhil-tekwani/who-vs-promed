2 cases of East African trypanosomiasis were confirmed in
Johannesburg, South Africa in the last month.
Both patients most likely acquired the disease in the Kasungu
National Park, Malawi. The 1st was a British soldier who took part
in a field exercise in Malawi. The 2nd was a South African tourist
who was on a trans-Africa overland safari.
Both patients noticed large, single erythematous skin lesions (in the
groin and on the foot, respectively) while in the Kasungu National
Park and reported numerous tsetse fly bites. Both patients visited
the park within a 2-week period in the middle of November 2005.
The British soldier presented a week after the tsetse fly bite with
fever and multi-organ failure. He had renal failure,
thrombocytopenia, raised liver enzymes, and evidence of possible
cardiac involvement with a bradycardia and features suggestive of
Wenkebach-type [atrioventricular] heart block.
The 2nd patient presented about 10 days after being bitten with fever
and drowsiness and was investigated as possible malaria.
In both cases the diagnosis was confirmed in the laboratory on blood
smear examination. Both patients responded well to suramin. The
South African tourist, although clinically well, is still being
followed up to exclude central nervous system involvement.

[Trypanosomiasis has been emerging in Central Africa over the past
decade, but this is the 1st time that ProMED has had a report of
cases which definitely were infected in Malawi. There are 8 human
trypanosomiasis-affected districts out of the 25 districts in Malawi:
Rumphi in the northern region; Kasungu, Ntchisi, and Nhotakota in the
central region; and Mangochi, Machinga, Chikwawa, and Mulanje in the
southern region. The awareness level regarding human trypanosomiasis
is very low among both health workers and the community (source:
<http://www.fao.org/paat/html/mwi.htm>).
The local reactions at the site of tsetse fly bites are
characteristic of _Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense_ and are associated
with regional lymphadenopathy. Early treatment is life-saving, and
trypanosomiasis should be considered in differential diagnosis in
travellers from Malawi. Data on indigenous cases will be greatly
appreciated. - Mod.EP]
