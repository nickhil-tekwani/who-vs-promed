[The CDC web-site <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hanta/hps/index.htm>
identifies hantaviruses in the New World as follows.

North America: Hantaviruses in the New World are associated with hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Sigmodontine rodents carry the hantaviruses that
cause HPS and are found throughout the Americas. Sin Nombre virus, carried
by _Peromyscus maniculatus_, is the predominant cause of HPS in the United
States and Canada. Mononghela, New York, Bayou, and Black Creek Canal
viruses also cause HPS and are found in eastern Canada and eastern and
southeastern United States.

In South and Central America, hantaviruses that have been identified as
causing HPS are Andes virus in Argentina and Chile; Andes-like viruses
including Oran, Lechiguanas, and Hu39694 in Argentina; Laguna Negra virus in
Bolivia and Paraguay; Bermejo virus in Argentina; Juquitiba virus in Brazil;
and Choclo virus in Panama.

Numerous other hantaviruses have been identified but have not been linked to
human disease. - Mod.CP]

Illinois: 2nd Case of Hantavirus Infection Confirmed
---------------------------------------------------
A greenhouse worker has been diagnosed with only the 2nd known Illinois case
of hantavirus [pulmonary syndrome], a rare rodent-spread disease that also
killed an Illinois man in 1996, state health officials announced Wed 25 May
2005.

The 22-year-old developed hantavirus pulmonary syndrome while working at a
greenhouse in Kankakee County, said Jennifer Williams, a spokeswoman for the
state Department of Public Health. The man, whose name and town were not
released, first experienced symptoms on Sun 1 May 2005, Williams said. He
was hospitalized shortly afterward with chest pain, difficulty breathing and
bleeding from the nose, but has since been released, Williams said.

Rodent droppings where found during a search of both the greenhouse and the
infected man's home, but neither location had a severe infestation of mice,
said Bonnie Schaafsma, administrator for the Kankakee County Health
Department. She said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
confirmed this week that the man was infected with hantavirus.

Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is a severe respiratory infection that can be
deadly if it isn't treated quickly. [Hantaviruses belong to] a family of
viruses named after a river in Korea, where the first strain infected 3000
U.S. soldiers during the Korean War, killing 190 of them. It is spread by
rodent urine, feces or saliva, typically making people ill about 2 weeks
after they breathe virus particles stirred up in a rodent-infested space.
The illness usually starts like influenza, with symptoms including muscle
aches and fever, then shortness of breath and coughing. Fewer than 400
Americans have been diagnosed with hantavirus infection since it was first
identified in the United States in 1993 in the 4 Corners region of the
Southwest.

The 1996 death of a man from northwestern Illinois was the only other case
of hantavirus infection recorded in Illinois, according to the state health
department. Williams said the 40-year-old man died at University of
Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics in Madison, Wis., after a short illness.

Officials warned the public on Wednesday to be cautious when cleaning areas
infected with rodent droppings because hantavirus infection can be
contracted from airborne dust.

"What happens is often at this time of year many people do spring cleaning.
If you're in a rural area or a farm environment, you may be cleaning sheds
or garages, places where there may be mouse droppings," Schaafsma said.

Alberta: Family Affected by Hantavirus Infection; One Adult fatality
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Hantavirus has killed an adult in central Alberta in the province's 1st
death in 3 years from [hantavirus pulmonary syndrome]. 2 other people from
the victim's family -- another adult and a child -- are being treated in
hospital, health officials said on Wed 12 May 2005. One person is listed in
serious condition and the other's state has stabilized, Alberta Health
officials said. The department didn't identify the people or their
community, saying only that they're from the David Thompson Health Region,
which includes Red Deer.

Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is a respiratory illness spread, in Alberta,
by infected deer mice through their droppings, urine or saliva. It is most
common in spring, when people are outdoors or spring cleaning and breathe in
the airborne particles. An infected person may initially have symptoms such
as fever, chills, fatigue, aching muscles and gastrointestinal problems.
After a few days, this can change to coughing and shortness of breath as
fluid fills the lungs.

Health officials are warning the public to ventilate enclosed areas
thoroughly before cleaning, to dispose of mouse droppings carefully, and to
thoroughly clean areas where mice have been. However, Alberta Health said
the chance of contracting the virus is low. Even when it is most widespread
in the rodent community, hantavirus infects "only a tiny proportion" of
people who come in contact with it, the department said.

Since 1989, there have been 9 deaths from hantavirus in Alberta, the last in
April 2002.

[The following additional information regarding hantaviruses as
an "Occupational Health Risk in Alberta" has been compiled by Charles Masur
MD of the University of Calgary
<http://www.med.ucalgary.ca/oemweb/masuras.htm>.

"Since the recent death of an Edmonton-area man, the public in general and
workers in particular have expressed considerable concern about their risk
of exposure to "hantavirus". This statement provides some general
information about the organism and its clinical presentation, and offers
some guidelines to employers and workers in an effort to reduce the risk of
occupational exposure to this organism.

Hantaviruses primarily infect rodents and, on occasion, may be transmitted
directly to humans. There are several species of hantavirus, including
Hantaan, Puumala, Seoul, Prospect Hill, and the newly identified Muerto
Canyon and Black Creek species.

Until the discovery of the Muerto Canyon virus (now designated the virus
species _Sin Nombre virus_), hantaviruses were recognized as responsible for
an array of diseases ranging from the "flu-like" illness caused by the Seoul
organism to the hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome due to Hantaan virus.
Since May 1993 Sin Nombre virus has been documented as the cause of severe
disease (Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome or HPS) with reported fatality rates
of up to 77 percent.

The main reservoir of Sin Nombre virus is the deer mouse, _Peromyscus
maniculatus_. This rodent, also called the white-footed mouse, is one of the
most common mice found in Alberta. Infection by the virus has no apparent
adverse effect on the mouse but causes it to release viral particles in its
feces, urine and saliva.

The primary mode of transmission of Sin Nombre virus to humans is through
the inhalation of aerosolized viral particles carried on dust from the feces
or dried urine of infected deer mice. This virus may be transmitted from
mouse-to-mouse through biting behaviour via saliva and may also be
transmitted to humans by bites from infected mice.

It is not known exactly how long the virus survives outside the mouse but
cases of HPS have been reported up to 43 days following exposure to mice
and/or their feces or urine. Hantavirus disease usually develops within 7 to
14 days after exposure to mice or their droppings.

Hantavirus particles are enclosed in a lipid layer that can be broken down
by most disinfectants. Thus, dilute hypochlorite solution (1:10 household
bleach with water), detergents, ethyl alcohol (70 percent) and most general
purpose household disinfectants are effective in destroying the virus. Any
of these substances are useful in cleaning up mouse excreta and dead mice,
and also in disinfecting rodent traps.

The clinical presentation of an individual with Sin Nombre virus infection
has 2 phases. The first is a prodromal period averaging about 4 days in
length where infected individuals complain of non-specific "flu-like"
symptoms which almost always include fever, and often include headache,
cough, sore muscles and joints, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Laboratory
testing for specific evidence of Hantavirus at this stage is not currently
available. Following the prodromal phase, the clinical situation evolves
rapidly with continued fever and the development of severe respiratory
distress. Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, hypotension and respiratory
distress syndrome ensue and require prompt admission to hospital.

Common laboratory findings accompanying the pulmonary syndrome include
leucocytosis, hemoconcentration, and thrombocytopenia; bilateral pulmonary
interstitial infiltrates are seen on x-ray. Specific laboratory testing for
Hantavirus disease is available through the Provincial Laboratory for Public
Health and includes serological, immunohistochemical, and polymerase chain
reaction testing.

Treatment of HPS is mainly supportive and is focused on maintaining adequate
oxygenation and blood pressure, and on avoiding fluid overload.
Administration of Ribavirin, although utilized, has not been clearly
demonstrated to be helpful. Without hospitalization and intensive care
support death may follow within 9 days."

Quebec: 1st Case of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome in Province Confirmed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Health authorities are dealing with Quebec's 1st case of hantavirus
infection. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is a viral disease carried by wild
rodents -- especially deer mice. They are the principal animal reservoirs of
the virus in Canada. Humans can only be infected when they inhale the virus,
usually through dust containing mouse feces.

A man from Nicolet contracted the disease in a forest just north of Trois-
Rivieres in 2004. Health Canada has confirmed that the man has hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome, which is fatal in about half of cases.

Hantavirus made its first appearance in North America, when a mysterious
illness killed a dozen people in the American Southwest in 1993. Since then,
it has spread across the continent, although it has been concentrated mostly
in the West. It killed an adult this month in Alberta.

Mice themselves don't appear to get sick from the virus. But if they are
infected, they excrete the virus in their feces, urine and saliva. Humans
are at risk when the droppings get stirred up in the air, by sweeping, for
example.

Quebec public health authorities considered this 1st case a serious matter,
but said people could take simple precautions. People reopening their
cottages should clean up well using a broom, not a vacuum, and wear gloves
and a mask clearly marked NIOSH N95 or NIOSH N100, which are standards of
the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.

"Our patient survived, which is not a miracle, but almost," said Dr. Sylvie
Lacoursiere of the provincial Public Health Department in Trois-Rivieres.
