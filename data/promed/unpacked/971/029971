At least 2 samples collected in August 2020 from minks in a single farm were found positive for SARS-CoV-2; this has been was revealed by LAV [Lega Anti Vivisezione/Antivivisection League]. Reportedly, this information was obtained after numerous appeals and requests to access the relevant documents, addressed by LAV to the Ministry of Health, to the Scientific Technical Committee, to the Regions, and to the IZS [Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale/Experimental Zooprophylactic Institute] (of Lombardy and Emilia Romagna), finally discovering the results of molecular tests only in these hours.

Following the initial discovery of the said positive cases, the Ministry of Health (and the Regions) continued to limit themselves to clinical observation even though it is known that mink, like people, can be asymptomatic.

We renew the appeal to Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and Minister of Health Roberto Speranza to urgently ban these farms. Other European states have already done so and now they do not run this additional risk of spreading the coronavirus.

[LAV (Lega Anti Vivisezione/Antivivisection League) is an Italian animal rights association. Official confirmation or otherwise of LAV's presented information re 2 positive minks (one farm) is requested. In case confirmed, these findings are due to be reported to the OIE as an emerging animal disease.

According to a 2017 report (https://www.altinget.dk/misc/Fur-Invasive-19-09.pdf), Italy's mink farms are located in Lombardy, Veneto, and Emilia-Romagna. The report stated that at least 15 EU-countries and 20 European countries produced, at the time of its publication, raw mink skins. Denmark, Poland, and the Netherlands were the main producers.

COVID-19 in farmed minks has, so far, been reported to the OIE from Netherlands, Denmark, Spain, and the USA. The virus spread widely in the Netherlands, human to animal infections suspected to be followed by some animal to human infections; culling policy was and is being applied. Later, the disease has been reported from Denmark's North Jutland, spreading southwards. Denmark is one of the world's 2 leading mink-farming countries (the other one is China).

While the total number of infected mink holdings in Denmark, on 19 Oct 2020, was 105, reported from 11 municipalities located in 2 of Denmark's 5 main regions, the numbers have become, respectively, 166, 14, and 3 as of 28 Oct 2020. This means that 15% of the Danish mink farms are already infected.
