Nearly 60 farm workers were exposed to chemicals Tuesday [18 Jun 2019] morning as they worked on a vineyard west of Dinuba, CA. Of these, 3 workers were taken to Kaweah Delta Medical Center in Visalia as firefighters and officials from the health department and agricultural commission investigated the extent of the exposure.

Tulare County firefighters were dispatched at 10:45 am to a vineyard on Avenue 408 west of Road 56 after farm workers reported falling ill as they worked. Firefighters who arrived found that nearly 60 farm workers who had been working at the vineyard were possibly exposed. Some reported symptoms of nausea and vomiting.

According to Tulare County Fire Cpt. Joe Rosa, the workers were exposed to pesticides having blown over from across the street, where a stone fruit orchard was being sprayed. Marianna Gentert, Tulare County's deputy agriculture commissioner for pesticide use enforcement, said farm workers who had been interviewed during the investigation reported hearing an air blast sprayer in the area and then smelling a pesticide.

The county office was aware of spraying that would be taking place in that area, Gentert said. An investigator from the commission would be in charge of following up with the growers about who and what was being sprayed.

An official from the Tulare County Department of Environmental Health said a miticide called Onager Optek and an insecticide called Reaper Clearform were the pesticides being sprayed. Both are agricultural products that are harmful if swallowed or inhaled. Fire Cpt. Rosa told The Bee the chemicals hexythiazox and abamectin were involved in the exposure.

Gentert said not all workers showed symptoms, but all were required to be processed for decontamination. As of 3 pm, firefighters were still on scene, along with a crew from the Tulare County Environmental Health department. Clothing samples would be taken in for inspection. Rosa said the workers were being taken to a "collection point," where they could be picked up by family or friends once cleared.

[While the workers experienced an exposure, and felt ill with nausea and vomiting, we have few other specific details. We know it was smelled, but we do not know if this chemical came across as a cloud or if it was only a smell. Nor do we know how long the smell persisted in the environment or whether the environment was hot, wet, cloudy, etc., which can affect how long a chemical may "hang" in the air.

Hexythiazox is used for the control of eggs and larvae of many phytophagous mites on fruit, citrus, vegetables, vines and cotton. Hexythiazox is a white crystalline solid. It is odorless. Hexythiazox is not very soluble in water.

Workers using hexythiazox may breathe in mists or have direct skin contact. There is a slight risk the general population may be exposed by consumption of contaminated food or dermal contact with treated golf course grasses. If hexythiazox is released to the environment, it will be broken down in air. Hexythiazox released to air will also be in or on particles that eventually fall to the ground. It is expected to be broken down by sunlight. It will not move into air from moist soil and water surfaces. It is not expected to move through soil. It will be broken down by microorganisms, and is expected to build up in fish.

No abnormal medical findings were reported in workers employed at a plant that manufactured hexythiazox. The only other information on the potential for hexythiazox to produce toxic effects is a single case of accidental "poisoning" (no specific details available). Hexythiazox is a minimal eye irritant in laboratory animals. It did not cause skin irritation or allergic skin reactions. The potential for hexythiazox to cause cancer in humans has not been assessed by the US EPA IRIS program, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, or the US National Toxicology Program 14th Report on Carcinogens.

Avermectins have been used for the control of parasites and insects; however, human data concerning poisoning are lacking. This study investigated the clinical spectrum of avermectin poisoning. A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate patients with avermectin poisoning reported to a poison center from September 1993 through December 1997. A total of 18 patients with abamectin (Agri-Mek; 2% wt/wt abamectin) exposure and one with ivermectin (Ivomec; 1% wt/vol ivermectin) ingestion were identified. There were 14 male and 5 female patients, ranging in age from 15 to 83 years. Most patients were exposed as a result of attempted suicide (14). Oral ingestion (15) was the most common route of exposure. A total of 4 patients were asymptomatic, and 8 had minor symptoms after a mean ingestion of 23 mg/kg abamectin (range, 4.2-67 mg/kg), or after dermal and inhalation contact. Also, 7 patients manifested severe symptoms, such as coma (7), aspiration with respiratory failure (4), and hypotension (3), after a mean ingestion of 100.7 mg/kg avermectin (15.4 mg/kg for ivermectin and 114.9 mg/kg for abamectin). All 7 patients received intensive supportive care; one patient died 18 days later as a result of multiple organ failure. Ingestion of a large dose of avermectin may be associated with life-threatening coma, hypotension, and subsequent aspiration. (Source: Chung K, Yang CC, Wu ML, et al.

So while our overall knowledge of what happened is a bit fuzzy, we do know there are reports indicating exposures to these chemicals could easily cause some weakness, vomiting, and nausea. Likely, these workers may have been slightly dehydrated as well, and this may have exacerbated the clinical signs. We wish those affected a speedy recovery. - Mod.TG
