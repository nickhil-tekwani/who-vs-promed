The Department of Health (DOH), through its Provincial Health Team Office (PHTO), is verifying what could be an outbreak of chikungunya in 2 barangays [barangay, barrio, the smallest administrative division in the Philippines] of Santa Lucia in Ilocos Sur province.

Dave Zaragoza, monitoring officer of the PHTO-Ilocos Sur, said at least 62 cases of suspected chikungunya virus infections have been reported in Barangays Paoc Norte and San Pedro. "However, there's no confirmation yet whether it is chikungunya or not, because the results of the examination by DOH on the laboratory specimens taken from the victims have not yet been released," said Zaragoza. He said his team is coordinating with the Rural Health Unit (RHU) in Santa Lucia to closely monitor residents in the 2 barangays as a sanitation drive was launched to prevent any further infections.

Chikungunya is a mosquitoborne virus with symptoms like the presence of rashes, pain in the lower back, joint pain (with or without the presence of swelling), vomiting, nausea, headaches, chills, and fever.

[The newswire above reports suspected chikungunya cases that need to be confirmed.

Chikungunya virus infections have been occurring in various geographic locations in the Philippines. Last year (2013), chikungunya virus outbreaks continued in several localities of the Philippines.

The number of cases of the mosquitoborne viral disease, chikungunya, eclipsed 1600 cases during the 1st 11 months of 2013, and the number of cases, 1609, was nearly triple the total of 561 cases recorded in 2012 (http://www.theglobaldispatch.com/chikungunya-fever-cases-top-1600-in-the-philippines-nearly-triple-2012-numbers-30092/).

The Department of Health is also reminding the public to heed the experts' advice to search and destroy the breeding sites of mosquitos, seek protective measures like wearing long sleeves and pajamas or using mosquito nets, and seek early consultation with a doctor, especially when one is suffering with a high fever for 2 or more days, to avoid the complications of the disease and even death (http://reliefweb.int/report/philippines/reported-increase-dengue-measles-and-chikungunya-tacloban-closely-monitored-doh-0).

Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an insectborne virus, of the genus _Alphavirus_, spread by _Aedes_ mosquitoes. Chikungunya infection causes fever and severe joint pain. Other symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash. The disease shares some clinical signs with dengue, and can be misdiagnosed in areas where dengue is common. There have been recent breakouts of chikungunya in Africa, Asia, and the Indian subcontinent.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes there is currently no vaccine or medicine to prevent chikungunya. People can protect themselves by preventing mosquito bites. There is no cure for the disease. Treatment is focused on relieving the symptoms. The proximity of mosquito breeding sites to human habitation is a significant risk factor for chikungunya. An effective public education effort will be necessary to enlist public collaboration for elimination of vector mosquito breeding sites.

PRO/MBDS and ProMED-mail would appreciate further information from knowledgeable sources about the results of the suspected chikungunya outbreak.
