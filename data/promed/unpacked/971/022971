Outbreak of _S. enteritidis_ PT4b Infection in the Netherlands
------------------------------------------------------------
A cluster of 12 cases of infection with _Salmonella enteritidis_ phage type
(PT) 4b was identified in the Netherlands in the last week of Nov 2000 from
data from the national reference laboratory system that includes 62% of all
laboratory diagnoses of salmonellosis in the country.
Since Netherlands adopted the English phage typing system in 1997 no cases
of this phage type had been reported, and information from participants in
the Enter-net network showed that it was rare in most of Europe. One week
before these cases were detected, _S. enteritidis_ PT4b was reported
through the national reference laboratory system, coming from a private
quality control analysis of one batch of bean sprouts.
By 15 Dec the number of cases had risen to 25, and a second report of
contaminated bean sprouts from the same producer was received. Cases were
scattered throughout the country and all had become ill between 3 and 24
Nov. Of these cases, 16 were females; all age groups (1 to 65 years) were
affected; most were children under 10 years of age. The commonest notified
symptoms reported were diarrhea (bloody diarrhea in many cases), abdominal
cramps, fever, and vomiting. Most of the cases were ill for more than a week.
The gastroenteritis epidemiology team of the Rijksinstituut voor
Volksgezondheit en Milieu (RIVM, the Dutch institute for public health and
the environment) interviewed 8 of the first 12 cases with an extensive
trawling questionnaire to identify common factors. These interviews
identified 3 possible risk factors for infection: eating chicken, eggs, and
bean sprouts.
A case control study is underway to investigate if there is a real
association between the cases and any of these food items. At the same
time, the company that produced and distributed the contaminated sprouts
was contacted and voluntarily took several measures, including intensified
testing and blockade of the raw materials from which the contaminated
sprouts were grown and amendment of decontamination procedures at the start
of cultivation. The company's production facilities were inspected and
environmental samples were taken.
