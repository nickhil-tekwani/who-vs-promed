[_Bonamia ostreae_ is a protistan parasite of the phylum
Haplosporidia. Infection with _Bonamia ostreae_ is also known as
bonamiosis, microcell disease, and 'haemocyte disease of flat oysters'.

According to the OIE's (World Organisation for Animal Health) disease
card "Infection with _Bonamia ostreae_,"
<http://www.oie.int/aac/eng/Publicat/Cardsenglish/3.1.1_Bostreae%20card%20(IArzul).DOC>,
the geographical distribution of the parasite is Europe (France,
Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom
excluding Scotland), The United States of America (California, Maine
and Washington States), and Canada (British Columbia). Hence, the
above reported discovery of _Bonamia ostreae_ in Scotland reflects
its spread to a hitherto uninfected area. Further details on the
disease are available in Chapter 2.2.1. of the OIE Manual of
Diagnostic Tests for Aquatic animals 2006, available at
<http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/fmanual/A_00037.htm>. - Mod.AS]
