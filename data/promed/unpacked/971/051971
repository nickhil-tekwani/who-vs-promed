A colt that died of eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] in Brunswick County is the 19th confirmed case of the almost-always fatal disease in horses in North Carolina this year [2012], county health officials said Tuesday [6 Nov 2012]. Previous cases of the mosquito-transmitted disease in horses were reported in Bladen, Carteret, Columbus, Cumberland, Durham, Harnett, Onslow, Pitt, Richmond, Robeson, and Sampson counties, according to the US Geological Survey Disease Maps 2012 website.

Though rare in humans, eastern equine encephalitis is a very serious illness and can be fatal. North Carolina has 1 reported case of eastern equine encephalitis in a human for 2012, in Cumberland County, the USGS website says.

County health officials urged hunters and other outdoorsmen to minimize their exposure to mosquitoes from dusk to dawn.

[This case is very late in the year; it is a bit unusual to have EEE in November. Of course there are places that have not had killing frosts and the recent rains on the east coast of the US may well have spawned some mosquitoes in addition to welcome rain, [and unwelcome] flooding and storms.

However, the sadness is that this is preventable if people would just vaccinate their horses.
