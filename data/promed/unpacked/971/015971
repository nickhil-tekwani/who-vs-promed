Cote d'Ivoire: 15 cases of rabies detected in 9 months
------------------------------------------------------
On the occasion of World Rabies Day, 4 Oct 2013, it was revealed that the number of animals able to transmit rabies virus infection now includes horses, oxen and sheep. This information was provided by Dr. Joseph Benie of the National Institute of Public Health.

Subsequently he announced that that 15 people had died so far this year [2013] from rabies virus infection in Cote d'Ivoire.

Professor Emmanuel Bissagnene, an Infectious Diseases expert, stated that: "Rabies is a viral disease transmitted from animals to humans by a bite, a scratch, or by contact with a mucous membrane. He added that rabies is a 100 percent fatal infection, with patients exhibiting extreme agitation, followed by anxiety and finally paralysis.

Professor Bissagnene urged people to get vaccinated against rabies because: "There is no cure; only rabies vaccine can protect against this disease."

This World Rabies Day event was organised by Sanofi Pasteur in collaboration with the National Institute of Public Health.

[Although rabies virus infection is clearly a major problem in Cote d'Ivoire, this is the 1st report received by ProMED-mail. The recommendation for the population to seek rabies virus vaccination seems unrealistic [in view of the cost]. More feasible and less expensive strategies should feature control and vaccination of domestic dogs, with human vaccination limited to those requiring post-exposure prophylaxis.

It is recommended that the vaccine series should be given in conjunction with rabies immune globulin. The US CDC recommendations for vaccination are given at http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/resources/acip_recommendations.html
and for immune globulin at
