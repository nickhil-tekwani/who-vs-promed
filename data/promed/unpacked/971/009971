Community leaders in Kensington say 2 residents have contracted hepatitis A within the last month and are encouraging neighbors to get vaccinated as soon as possible. Free vaccinations are currently being provided by the city for anyone worried about exposure.

Philadelphia health officials sounded the alarm this month [July 2019] about an upsurge in reports of the infectious disease. The number of cases citywide, about 30 annually, has quintupled in the last 2 years. Most at risk are people who are battling homelessness and drug addiction, according to health department data. But in both of the current Kensington cases, the people stricken are active leaders in the neighborhood, with stable housing and no history of drug use.

The disease, a contagious liver infection, usually spreads through feces, a public health issue that Kensington residents and business owners contend with to a shocking degree.

Human waste is a common sight in the blocks around Kensington Avenue, which has been caught in the riptide of the opioid epidemic. It appears on sidewalks, in the streets, in vacant lots, and even on some residents' front stoops. It is also a remediable side effect of the ongoing crisis that the city hasn't stepped up to address, says Nick Fury, a Kensington resident, civic leader, and mechanic who owns an auto-body shop in the neighborhood.

"It amazes me that there is so much human suffering -- and human feces -- throughout this neighborhood," he said. "But people are pooping on the street because they have no other option."

[Pennsylvania, to this point, has not been listed among the USA states where outbreaks of hepatitis A have been announced. It is noteworthy that the 2 cases mentioned were not in the high-risk groups, suggesting the possibility of transmission via infected food-service workers. Rarely does a day go by without anecdotal reports of such workers in restaurants becoming ill with HAV. To this point, there are no formal guidelines to require food-industry workers to be immunized against hepatitis A. Immigrants from the developing world are much less likely to be involved than USA-born workers as they are likely to have been infected as children and are thus immune. - Mod.LL
