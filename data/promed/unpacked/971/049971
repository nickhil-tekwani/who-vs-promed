In reference to your comments in ProMED post 20060811.2248
Undiagnosed deaths - India (UP), 11 Aug 2006:
-----------------------------------------------
"[India must be the world champion for undiagnosed diseases; since
1999 ProMED has posted 67 reports of undiagnosed outbreaks in humans
and animals there (human outbreaks listed below, note reports from
Uttar Pradesh state in 2002, 2004 and 2005). In a few cases, these
have eventually been diagnosed as Japanese encephalitis, Kyasanur
Forest disease or Chandipura fever, but in most cases no final
diagnosis came to the ears of ProMED. We encourage our readers to
follow Dr. Mishra's example and send us news of outbreaks, and
especially of the final diagnosis, when known. - Mod.JW]"
I would like to inform you that:
* India has a large population of more than one billion people, and
as a federal structure, where health is a state subject, information
from states to center is not mandatory.
* The state of Uttar Pradesh itself has the 8th largest population
of the world (166 052 859 as per the provisional results of the
Census of India 2001).
* Media in the country is free and unrestricted, which results in
reporting of all kinds of health events
(major/minor/confirmed/unconfirmed etc.) and usually of sensational
value. Invariably, the reporting of events is at an early stage when
laboratory results are not immediately available, and this is never
followed up by the media reports of confirmed laboratory results,
which results in the so-called large number of undiagnosed outbreaks.
* Most of the outbreaks in Uttar Pradesh have been due to AES (acute
encephalitis syndrome), which poses difficulty in laboratory
confirmation, especially in the early phase of the outbreak, if
Japanese encephalitis has been ruled out as the diagnosis.
* Currently, the country is not under any obligation to report
"public health emergencies of international concern" to
international agencies. These issues will be taken care of only after
the implementation of the revised International Health Regulations,
which come into effect in 2007-2009.
* In the present posting, the details are very sketchy, and the
doctor [concerned] should have verified some details from the local
health authorities before reporting. Such reports only add to the
list of mysterious disease outbreaks.

[ProMED appreciates this clarification from WHO India. Although
Brazil, Canada, USA and many others are federal countries, they do
report outbreaks to the center; this assists in obtaining federal
help with a state health problem. We wonder how India will be able to
comply with the revised International Health Regulations if there is
no reporting to the center. It seems the independent national and
local press are performing a useful service in providing early
warning of outbreaks.
The fact that most of the undiagnosed outbreaks in UP are due to AES
is important information. We wonder what the diagnoses (possibly of
varied etiology?) of non-Japanese encephalitis will turn out to be,
since encephalitis is an annually recurring problem. We realize that
state health department staff are very busy people, but it could help
their public relations to issue press releases with the final
diagnoses of these outbreaks. We welcome any further information on
this and other mystery outbreaks. - Mod.JW]
