International outbreak of Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 ­- update from Enter-net
------------------------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of _Salmonella typhimurium_ definitive phage type (DT) 104
associated with consumption of an imported foodstuff was reported recently
by Sweden (1). The contaminated product was helva (or halva), a type of
dessert made from sesame seeds, and product sampling showed 4 jars of
pistachio flavored and one of chocolate flavored helva to be positive for
this organism. The strains were resistant to the antimicrobials ampicillin,
chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulphonamides, and tetracyclines. Once it
was suspected that the vehicle in the Swedish outbreak was an imported
product, whose distribution to other countries was not known at the time, a
request for information was sent via Enter-net (2) on 29 Jun 2001 to
ascertain whether any other countries had any cases that may be associated
with this product.
The Australian health authorities had been investigating a cluster of 14
cases of this sero- and phage type in Melbourne, Victoria, and had been
unable at the time to identify the vehicle of infection (3). The
information disseminated through Enter-net and Eurosurveillance Weekly
allowed them to review the cases and identify a clear epidemiological
association with helva imported from Turkey. Subsequent product sampling
has led to the identification of _S. typhimurium_ DT104 in 2 brands of
helva; in chocolate, plain, and pistachio flavors. Isolates from the
Australian cases and both brands were resistant to ampicillin,
chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulphonamides, and tetracyclines; the
strains were also tested for, and showed resistance to, spectinomycin.
No other countries currently have identified cases that are associated with
this type of product, but since it is distributed to both Sweden and
Australia, it is possible that other countries may also import the product
and have cases associated with its consumption. This type of product has
also been found to be positive for _S. typhimurium_ in Germany. The act
that an international outbreak of the same infection associated with a
similar product on opposite sides of the globe at the same time can be
recognized demonstrates the value of being able to rapidly disseminate
information on international outbreaks of foodborne disease through
mechanisms such as Enter-net, Eurosurveillance Weekly, and ProMED-mail.

[This article clearly illustrates the importance of maintaining
international communication networks. It is through these networks that
enhanced and more rapid disease surveillance, outbreak identification and
disease control measures can be implemented. As mentioned in this article,
it is highly probable that other countries have imported the same
implicated helva products in chocolate, plain, and pistachio flavors and
may in fact have had cases of _S. typhimurium_ DT104 associated with these
products. This outbreak serves as yet another reminder that we now live in
a global village, sharing in our food products. Assistance from appropriate
authorities in Turkey to identify the geographic distribution of export of
the involved products would also be of assistance in further defining the
scope of this international outbreak. ProMED-mail would also appreciate
information from other countries with cases of _S. typhimurium_ DT104 to
further define the scope of this outbreak. - Mod.MPP
