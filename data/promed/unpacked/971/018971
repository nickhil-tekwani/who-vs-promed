The Leprosy Mission Nigeria, on Wednesday [22 Jan 2014], raised alarm over new cases of leprosy in Nigeria, as about 3805 new cases of the disease were recorded last year [2013]. The National Director of the Leprosy Mission Nigeria, Dr Udo Sunday, disclosed that of this number, 10 per cent were children, and 12 per cent were already deformed as a result of lack of care. According to him, the North East zone of the country accounted for most of the cases.

Speaking at an event to mark the 61st World Leprosy Day, he expressed fears of likely resurgence of the disease in the country if the Federal Government did not step up on the gains of what it did before. He warned that Tanzania and Liberia were already experiencing resurgence of the disease, while 16 countries in the world today still found more than 1000 new cases every year, of which Nigeria was one of them.

"Nigeria needs to put in more efforts in order to detect early cases, because if they are not detected on time, they are bound to cause disabilities which have a socio-economic impact on the society," he said. Dr Sunday stated that a survey carried out revealed that 27 per cent of street beggars across the country were leprosy victims.

He regretted that Nigeria's healthcare system was solely focused on AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria (ATMs), while neglecting other diseases that have the potential of causing devastating damages to the system. He therefore warned that over 27 diseases, including leprosy, which the government was not giving attention, could cause harm to a large number of the population.

He called for the passage of the Bill on Disabilities, which is still pending before the National Assembly, saying that leprosy is not hereditary, but it is exacerbated by lack of political commitment, inadequate low referral and high level of stigmatization of sufferers.

[The news release above says that Nigeria reported 3805 new cases of leprosy in 2013, which, if correct, is the exact same number of new cases of leprosy detected in 2012 according to WHO (Table 3, http://www.who.int/wer/2013/wer8835.pdf). The news report above also says that 12 percent of the new cases reported in 2013 already had deformities resulting from untreated leprosy, which indicates the cases were detected late in the course of the disease; and another 10 percent of the new cases were children, which indicates continued transmission of the disease in the community. In 2012, according to WHO (Table 8, http://www.who.int/wer/2013/wer8835.pdf), 13.8 percent had deformities and 8.7 percent occurred in children.

Before 1998, Nigeria was one of the most leprosy-endemic countries in the world, with prevalence rates ranging from 16 to 390 per 10 000 (http://www.lepra.org.uk/platforms/lepra/files/lr/Mar05/Lep065_076.pdf). Following introduction of multidrug therapy for leprosy in 1985, Nigeria attained the WHO target for elimination as a public health problem of less than one case per 10 000 population at the national level by the end of 1998 (http://www.lepra.org.uk/platforms/lepra/files/lr/Mar05/Lep065_076.pdf). The registered prevalence of leprosy at the end of 2012 was 3915 cases, or a prevalence rate of 0.22 per 10 000 (http://www.who.int/wer/2013/wer8835.pdf).

Although the number of new cases of leprosy detected in Nigeria decreased from 5276 in 2004 to 3805 in 2013, (http://www.who.int/wer/2013/wer8835.pdf), Nigeria remains one of 16 countries reporting 1000 or more new cases of leprosy during 2012; these 16 countries account for 95 percent of the new cases detected worldwide during 2012 (http://www.who.int/wer/2013/wer8835.pdf). In 2012, Nigeria accounted for 1.6 percent of the total number of new cases (232 857) detected worldwide.

Nigeria, with an estimated population of 174 507 539 in 2013, is the most populous country in Africa and the 7th most populous country in the world (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria). It is located in West Africa on the Gulf of Guinea with the Republic of Benin to the west, Chad and Cameroon to the east, and Niger to the north.

Nigeria is a federal constitutional republic with 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.
