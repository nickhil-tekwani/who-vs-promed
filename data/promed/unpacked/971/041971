18 canine distemper cases reported in Troy in past 20 days
----------------------------------------------------------
Animal control says it's handled 18 cases of canine distemper in the
city's fox population over the last 20 days, posing a possible threat
to domestic animals.

The disease does not pose a direct threat to humans, said Police
Captain John Cooney, but the contraction of distemper by a domestic
animal such as a dog or cat is usually fatal. Foxes, raccoons,
opossums and coyotes are especially susceptible to the disease, and
once infected those animals behave unusually, which may put them in
closer contact to [domestic] animals and result in aggressive behavior.

"Citizens should be alert to any fox, raccoon or other non-social wild
animal out in public areas, appearing lethargic, walking with a
[peculiar] gait and looking unkempt," said Capt. Cooney. "Often there
will be discharge from the nostrils, eyes and mouth, and the animal
will exhibit contrary behavior. A fox or raccoon out in daylight
hours, although not totally against the animal's normal behavior, is a
warning sign of possible infection," said Cooney.

A majority of the sightings in Troy have been in the northern half of
the city, though recoveries have been made as far south as the
Morrison Avenue/HVCC area.

Residents are urged to make sure their pet distemper vaccination is up
to date.

Those who see an animal exhibiting normal behavior or appearance are
urged to contact Troy Police immediately.

[This article leaves me with some concern. It does not tell us how
they know it is distemper. The clinical signs listed could just as
easily be rabies. There is no mention of how they know it is
distemper. While an odd gait and a ocular-nasal discharge may be
distemper, it may also be some other disease.

Residents should be urged to vaccinate their pets against rabies as
well as against distemper. Both diseases are very hard and distemper
is generally fatal in our animals while rabies is always fatal in our
animals and is fatal in humans if left untreated. - Mod.TG]
