Malaria outbreak hits Quebec, doctors call for more screening
-------------------------------------------------------------
A malaria outbreak has erupted in Quebec, catching public health officials
by surprise and prompting calls for wider screening of immigrants. 12 cases
of malaria have been confirmed in the past month and 3 [more cases are
awaiting confirmation and more infections are expected.
All the cases involve refugees from central Africa who arrived on 9 Aug
2000. They were on a humanitarian flight to Montreal, which transported
about 240 desperate Rwandans and others from a refugee camp in Burundi,
said Dr. Ron St. John, director of emergency response at Health Canada's
Center for Emergency Response. "They came from a highly malarious area," he
said. "But they weren't screened for malaria."
Federal authorities are studying the outbreak and could produce new
screening recommendations for Immigration Canada, St. John said.
There's a small but real risk that malaria could spread beyond the original
refugee group to people who weren't on the flight, St. John added.
Current policy calls for routine screening of immigrants for tuberculosis
and syphilis. Those actively afflicted with a disease aren't allowed into
Canada until they're successfully rendered non-infectious. People coming
from known malarial hot zones should be checked for malaria before entering
the country, said Dr. Kevin Kain, director of the centre for tropical
medicine at Toronto General Hospital. Screening leads to treatment, so the
refugee population would benefit, he said. "If you do it right, it's a
win-win (situation)."

[It is no surprise that people from Rwanda are infected with malaria. If
born and raised in Africa it would be expected that all have had many
infections during their lifetimes and had developed some degree of
protective immunity. Asymptomatic carriers would therefore be common in a
group like this one. If the group is scattered throughout Canada, it would
be sensible to investigate for malaria at arrival and treat to ensure that
people do not come down with malaria in areas where expert diagnosis and
treatment are not easily available. It is presumed that the cases were _P.
falciparum_, and the risk of local transmission will be non-existent. -Mod.EP
