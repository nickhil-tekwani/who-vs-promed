48 persons died and 15 were blinded by the toxic effects of methanol
in an incident of mass poisoning in Nicaragua. Between 2 and 20 Sep
2006, 801 people were treated for methanol poisoning following the
ingestion of home-brewed local alcohol known as "guaro," which had
been adulterated by methanol. Most cases occurred in the departments
of Leon and Chinandega.
The Network of Toxicology of Latin America and the Caribbean
(RETOXLAC) played a critical role by providing information to
Nicaragua's Toxicology Reference Center on case management,
identifying a new antidote and making a network member available for
on-site technical assistance. A U.S. rug company, Jazz
Pharmaceuticals, donated the antidote medicine -- 1200 vials were
delivered to Nicaragua and put to immediate use.
PAHO/WHO assisted in the coordination and management of the donation
and importation of the antidote (Fomepizole) and the local purchase
of other essential drugs and supplies.
What is methanol?
------
Methanol is a clear, colorless liquid with a faint odor like alcohol,
making it impossible to detect when mixed in alcohol.
How much is too much?
-------
Less than a teaspoon of methanol can cause blindness and more than 4
teaspoons can be fatal.
What are the effects of methanol?
-------
Drinking methanol causes the same effects as excessive drinking, with
the addition of pronounced vision problems. However, after the
effects disappear, they reappear 6-30 hours later with much greater
severity. The most seriously poisoned lose consciousness and die of
respiratory or heart failure. Others may linger in a coma for as long
as a week and may be left blinded.

[Methanol, when it is substituted for ethanol or mixed into ethanol,
is very dangerous and has sad to fatal outcomes. Many locations in
Russia are currently experiencing similar tragedies -- see below. - Mod.TG]
