The provincial health office of South Cotabato is recommending the declaration of a state of calamity in Tampakan town over the rising number of cases involving mosquito-borne disease.

Dr. Rogelio B. Aturdido, provincial health officer, told media the declaration of a state of calamity will enable the municipal government to access more funds to assist victims of chikungunya [virus infections]. Mr. Aturdido said his office has recorded 215 cases of chikungunya as of last Monday [1 Jul 2013], noting an abrupt rise from 2 when the occurrence of the disease was reported in Tampakan more than a week ago.

The disease is concentrated in the villages of Maltana, Kipalbig and Poblacion, he said.

The World Health Organization (WHO), on its website, describes chikungunya as "a viral disease that is spread by mosquitoes. It causes fever and severe joint pain. Other symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash." WHO said the disease has similar clinical indiction with dengue, and can be misdiagnosed in areas where dengue is common. Although no cure has been discovered for the disease, "treatment is focused on relieving the symptoms," the United Nations health agency noted in a briefer. Symptoms for the disease, Mr. Aturdido said, include rashes, vomiting, and weakening of the body of the carrier.

He added that 5 of the patients are currently confined in the Provincial Hospital of South Cotabato for observation after severe symptoms were observed.

The mosquito _Aedes aegypti_, the same carrier of dengue virus, transmits chikungunya [virus], he said. Another species identified as _Aedes albopictus_ is also a carrier.

Mr. Aturdido said as a result of the disease, victims will feel arthritis-like symptoms in their joints for 5-6 months or even years.

WHO said most patients recover fully but may cause death to older victims. [Chikungunya virus infections do not cause significant mortality. - Mod.TY]

The rising cases of chikungunya [infections] are not the 1st in the country. In January this year [2013], Villareal town in Samar recorded 250 individuals afflicted with the same disease. Mr. Aturdido said the carrier mosquitoes attack at daytime with higher risks early in the morning and late in the afternoon.

Mr. Aturdido said prevention by cleaning up the surroundings is the 1st line of defense.

Part of the plan of the provincial health office is to launch a massive information drive to affected areas and the rest of the province.

The health department in Region 12 announced Thursday [4 Jul 2013] that 4 local residents have tested positive for mosquito-borne chikungunya disease. The findings were based on laboratory examination of blood samples from 4 of the 7 patients who showed signs of chikungunya [virus] infection. Health officials here declined to reveal the identities of the patients, now being observed by physicians [and] 2 other patients suspected of having contracted chikungunya virus are still being observed by the city government.

The office of the Department of Health in Region 12 said the chikungunya viral disease is just like the dengue fever, from which patients suffer recurring high fever, joint and muscular pains.

The 4 chikungunya cases here were confirmed by the Research Institute of Tropical Medicines in Metro Manila, according to the information office of the city government.

The city government of Kidapawan [Cotabato province] has launched a massive information campaign on how to prevent the spread of the chikungunya and dengue infections in all of the barangays here.

Local health authorities have recorded a rise in dengue cases here in recent weeks.

Jenny Ventura, information officer of DOH-12, said epidemiologists are now monitoring the local communities to determine the prevalence of dengue and chikungunya infections here and in surrounding North Cotabato towns.

[The previous ProMED-mail post of 2 Jul 2013 (archive no. 20130702.1803947) indicated that there were 180 suspected cases of chikungunya virus infection in 2 South Cotabato villages, and that number has now increased rapidly to 215 in 3 villages. Unless vector control measures are quickly implemented, this outbreak is likely to continue to grow. There is no commercially available vaccine to prevent chikungunya virus infections, so the only effective measure to prevent transmission of the virus is through timely control of mosquito vectors. A small outbreak has begun in Kidapawan, Cotabato. If conditions there facilitate virus transmission as they have in South Cotabato, more cases can be expected. With a population of 125 447 (2010 data), there is a large enough human population to support an outbreak if the mosquito population is abundant.
