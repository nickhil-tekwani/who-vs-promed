Low pathogenic avian influenza (poultry), Korea (Rep. of)
---------------------------------------------------------
Information received on 17 Dec 2010 from Dr Kiyoon Chang, CVO and
Director, Quarantine Policy Division, Food Safety and Consumer Affairs
Policy Bureau, MIFAFF (Ministry of Food, Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries), Gyeonggi-Do, Korea (Rep. of)

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Start date 07 Dec 2010
Date of 1st confirmation of the event 16 Dec 2010
Report date 17 Dec 2010
Date submitted to OIE 17 Dec 2010
Reason for notification: Reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence 17 Oct 2010
Manifestation of disease: Sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: Low pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype H7N2
Nature of diagnosis: Laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks
Outbreak 1 Nohwa-ri, Gyuam-myun, Buyeo-gun, Chungcheongnam-Do
Date of start of the outbreak 07 Dec 2010
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Species Birds
Susceptible 110
Cases 1
Deaths 0
Destroyed 110
Slaughtered 0

Affected Population: ducks and chickens

Epidemiology - Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection -
Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: As part of a continuous avian influenza
surveillance programme, samples (faeces, laryngo-pharyngeal swabs)
were collected from a poultry farm on 7 Dec 2010. HA test result in
Chungcheongnam-do Veterinary Research Institute was positive on 16 Dec
2010. The NVRQS found avian influenza antigen (H7) by PCR on 16 Dec
2010 and confirmed it as low pathogenic avian influenza virus (H7N2)
by gene sequencing on 17 Dec 2010.

Ducks and chickens in the farm were culled on 16 Dec 2010. There is no
other poultry farm within the area of 500m radius from the farm.

Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: H5 and H7 avian
influenza in its low pathogenic form in poultry is a notifiable
disease as per Chapter 10.4. on avian influenza of the Terrestrial
Animal Health Code (2010).

Control measures - Measures applied; Stamping out; Quarantine;
Movement control inside the country; Screening; Zoning; Disinfection
of infected premises/establishment(s); Vaccination prohibited; No
treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied - No other measures

Laboratory name and type: National Veterinary Research and Quarantine
Service (NVRQS) (National laboratory)
Species Birds
Test gene sequencing
Test date 17 Dec 2010
Result Positive

Species Birds
Test polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
Test date 16 Dec 2010
Result Positive

Future Reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[This new finding of a low pathogenic strain on a farm unit adds to
the complexity of the picture occurring now in South Korea as there
have been previous findings of H5N1 in wild birds in disparate
locations in separate provinces -- see Mod.AS comments in Avian
influenza (62): South Korea (GN) H5N1, wild bird, RFI 20101212.4417.

The new finding of an LPAI H7N2 on a small commercial duck and chicken
farm only adds to the texture of the epidemiology surrounding this
disease in South Korea. It is important to note that there have been
other LPAI outbreaks reported from South Korea over the last couple of
years -- see Avian influenza (48): South Korea, LPAI, H7N7, ducks, OIE
20101019.3790.

Clearly, this detailed picture of the epidemiology of the Avian
Influenza is only possible because good surveillance is being done by
the Animal Health authorities in South Korea as indicated in the OIE
report. Since good data appears to be being generated, it would be
wonderful if the tools provide by a sophisticated Geographic
Information System could be brought to bear to analyze the occurrence
and overlapping of both Highly Pathogenic and Low Pathogenic strains
on commercial farms and in wildlife.

The location for this outbreak can be seen on the map appended to the
OIE notification referenced above. For the location of the South
Korean Avian Influenza outbreaks involving H5N1 see HealthMap
