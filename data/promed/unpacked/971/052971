The Epidemiological Surveillance Unit of Bizkaia [Biscay] has identified an outbreak of hepatitis A virus infection in Bermeo beginning in September [2012]. So far, those affected are one adult and 5 children, 3 of whom showed symptoms this week. Professionals at the Health Centre of this fishing port and the Basque Government department of Health have declared that that the outbreak "is controlled" and therefore "there is no cause for alarm because, contrary to popular belief, hepatitis A is a mild illness."

However, yesterday [22 Nov 2012] the Public Health Department contacted the heads of educational establishments from kindergartens, elementary, and secondary schools in the town to request help in maximising existing hygiene measures to prevent further infections. Hepatitis A is spread by fecal-oral transmission, so it is necessary to pay special attention to washing hands, especially in circumstances where diapers may have been changed.

The 1st case occurred in September [2012]. Specifically, it was a 7 year-old girl who had traveled to a foreign country where hepatitis is endemic. Soon after, another 5-year-old child in the same family also developed symptoms and, almost simultaneously, there was another case, this time an adult. At this time it is not known if there is an epidemiological link between the adult and the children's cases.

In recent days, practitioners at the Bermeo ambulatory clinic have diagnosed hepatitis A virus infection in another 3 children, 2 of them 7 years of age and a 5 year old, who are all now recovering. None of the 6 cases have required hospitalisation, and the 1st patients have now recovered, The last 3 "are responding well to treatment, so it is possible that within a week or week and a half they will be able to return to school.

Hepatitis A is a disease caused by a virus of the _Picornaviridae_ family, which replicates in the liver, is excreted in the bile and is shed in the feces. Symptoms of infection may include nausea, vomiting, fever, lighter-coloured feces, and urine of a darker shade than usual. Once the patient undergoes treatment, symptoms may decline within 15 days, with no lasting effects.

[Bermeo is a town and municipality in the sub-region of Busturialdea. It is in the province of Biscay, part of the autonomous region of the Basque Country, in Northern Spain. Bermeo has 17 078 inhabitants and is the most important fishing port of the Basque Country. Bermeo can be located by via the interactive HealthMap/ProMED-mail at http://healthmap.org/r/4cuU.

Hepatitis A virus infection is transmitted through ingestion of contaminated food and water, or through direct contact with an infectious person. Hepatitis A is associated with a lack of safe water and poor sanitation.

In the situation in Bermeo, it is suggested that the infection was introduced as a consequence of foreign travel, and the small number of cases detected are related to this event. That may be correct because adults show signs and symptoms of illness more often than children, and the severity of disease increases in older age groups. Infected children under 6 years of age do not usually experience noticeable symptoms, and only 10 percent develop jaundice. Among older children and adults, infection usually causes more severe symptoms, with jaundice occurring in more than 70 percent of cases (see http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs328/en/index.html).

Community outbreaks can be contained by vaccination. - Mod.CP]
