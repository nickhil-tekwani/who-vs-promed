The Majlis Agricultural Committee says that 2 people have died in
Iran as a result of sporadic cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever
(CCHF). The importation of livestock to Iran to supplement the
domestic production of meat has been the cause of the spread of the
disease, MP Kazem Farahmand, the deputy chairman of the parliamentary
committee, told the Mehr News Agency on Saturday [11 Sep 2010].

CCHF is a viral disease, and it has reached Yazd, Fars, and
Sistan-Baluchestan provinces so far, he said. The importation of
livestock to the country is unavoidable, and thus it is imperative
that the Veterinary Organization of Iran conduct a quarantine period
on imported livestock on the borders in order to prevent the spread
of various diseases, he stated.

However, Farahmand said that the pervasiveness of livestock smuggling
into the country has made the control and quarantine process more
difficult. He said that a total of 6 people have been infected by the
disease so far, and 2 of them have died.

This disease is transmitted through blood, and people who are in
direct contact with infected meat are most susceptible to the virus,
Farahmand added. But the virus is killed if the infected meat is
frozen [after onset of rigor mortis - Mod.CP] or cooked, he noted.
CCHF is a widespread tick-borne viral disease that affects domestic
and wild animals and may also be transmitted to humans.

[Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral haemorrhagic
fever caused by a nairovirus (family _Bunyaviridae_). Although
primarily a zoonosis, sporadic cases and outbreaks of CCHF affecting
humans do occur. The disease is endemic in many countries in Africa,
Europe and Asia. The geographical distribution of the virus, like
that of its tick vector, is widespread.

Evidence of CCHF virus has been found in Africa, Asia, the Middle
East and Eastern Europe. Humans who become infected with CCHF acquire
the virus from direct contact with blood or other infected tissues
from livestock, or they may become infected from a tick bite. The
majority of cases have occurred in those involved with the livestock
industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and
veterinarians.

The length of the incubation period for the illness appears to depend
on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection via tick
bite, the incubation period is usually one to 3 days, with a maximum
of 9 days. The incubation period following contact with infected
blood or tissues is usually 5-6 days, with a documented maximum of 13
days. Onset of symptoms is sudden, with fever, myalgia (aching
muscles), dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache,
sore eyes and photophobia (sensitivity to light).

The nature of the exposure of these 6 Iranian cases is not disclosed,
but it is implied that it is associated with the slaughter of
illegally imported livestock. In a previous outbreak among abattoir
workers in Iran in 2009, the possibility of increased risk of
exposure due to the halal method of slaughter was discussed but
discounted.

The provinces of Yazd, Fars, and Sistan-Baluchestan can be located in
the map of the provinces of Iran at:
<http://www.artarena.com/map_p.htm>. These provinces are located in
the southern part of the country, and Sistan-Baluchestan borders
Pakistan. Otherwise, there is no clue as to the origin of the
imported livestock. Further information would be appreciated. -
