The 1st case of anthrax in Texas livestock for 2011 has been detected
on a ranch in Hill County near Whitney. The Texas Animal Health
Commission (TAHC) has quarantined the premise after one cow tested
positive for the reportable disease. The initial case is somewhat
unusual as it was detected earlier in the year than normal and in a
different part of the state than expected. There have been no previous
cases of anthrax in livestock reported in Hill County.

Anthrax is a bacterial disease caused by _Bacillus anthracis_, which
is a naturally occurring organism with worldwide distribution,
including Texas. Anthrax tends to be diagnosed in livestock and
wildlife, most commonly in the summertime in Texas. It usually is
detected in the southwest part of the state. In recent years, cases
have been primarily confined to a triangular area bounded by the towns
of Uvalde, Ozona and Eagle Pass [I would say Ozona, Rockspring,
Uvalde, and Del Rio, with outliers in Zapata and Jim Hogg counties. -
Mod.MHJ].

"Specimens were submitted to the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic
Laboratory (TVMDL) by the producer's veterinary practitioner,
following suspicions that were raised during a post mortem
examination," stated Dr. Max Dow, TAHC Region 3 Director in Fort
Worth. TAHC regulations require vaccination of susceptible livestock
on quarantined premises, as well as the proper disposal of affected
carcasses. Quarantines are usually released by the TAHC 10 days after
all requirements have been completed for disposal and vaccination.

"It is possible that the dry conditions that much of Texas is
enduring may have caused the 1st case of the year to be found earlier
than normal, and/or in a somewhat unusual location," stated Dr. Dee
Ellis, TAHC Executive Director. "The TAHC will continue to closely
monitor the situation for possible new cases across the state. In the
meantime, producers should consult with their veterinary practitioner
or local TAHC office about the disease in general and whether
vaccination needs to be considered for their animals," Dr. Ellis
added.

If an animal dies from the disease and isn't properly disposed of by
burning, the bacteria can spill out into the soil and remain dormant
for long periods of time. The anthrax bacteria may resurface on grass
or forage under ideal weather and soil conditions during spring and
summer months, which could then be ingested. Symptoms of anthrax in
livestock can be non-specific, including high fever or convulsions,
or, in many cases, acute death is the 1st sign noticed by a producer.
TAHC regulations require that not only the animal carcasses be
disposed of by incineration until "thoroughly consumed," but any
contaminated manure and/or bedding as well. This requirement keeps
wild animals from being exposed to the disease, and it will also kill
the bacteria, possibly preventing another site from being contaminated
with anthrax.

The following are general biosecurity tips that can be helpful to
livestock producers who suspect they have an anthrax affected animal
or carcass:

- Wear long sleeves and gloves when handling carcasses or when
working with or vaccinating livestock to avoid contaminating any sores
or scratches on arms or hands. See your doctor if you develop an
unusual-looking sore on your hands, arms or other exposed skin.
Although it is very rare to contract skin anthrax, this infection
requires treatment with antibiotics prescribed by a physician.

- Practice good sanitation. Wash your hands after handling livestock
(even if you wear gloves.) Disinfect equipment used on the animals or
carcasses. Keep pets and children away from carcasses or bones of dead
animals. Move healthy animals away from a pasture where animals have
died from the disease.

- Properly dispose of animal carcasses by burning to prevent exposure
to other animals, such as predators or dogs.

- Vaccinate livestock if cases occur in the surrounding areas.
Anthrax vaccine is a live vaccine, so it must not be administered with
antibiotics. Vaccinated animals must be withheld from slaughter for 2
months.

- Restrict the movement of livestock onto or from an affected premise
until animals can develop immunity through vaccination (about 10
days).

[I heard about this case on Wed 23 Mar 2011 and on the following day
passed my draft posting to TX VPH before posting. The above is the TX
AHC reply (today, 28 Mar 2011).

However, last week, I checked around. Hill County is SSW of Dallas.
Last year (2010) in the fall, the owner had lost 8 animals within a
60-day interval in the same pasture; 3 were necropsied by his
veterinarian and samples submitted to TVMDL. This 2.5-year-old
pregnant heifer was found within 15 yards of a dirt water tank. The
animal had been seen apparently healthy on 17 Mar 2011 and was found
dead at noon on 18 Mar 2011. There were no signs of a struggle, and
she was in good body condition. The only significant necropsy findings
by 5 pm on 18 Mar 2011 were of a "blackberry jelly" spleen and
widespread patechial haemorrhages. TVMDL diagnosed anthrax on
culture.

The farm is merely 283 acres in a mixed residential and commercial
area, and with 32-36 head of cattle -- a cow-calf operation -- and one
boarded horse. The pasture where the animal was found slopes around
its perimeter down to the earthen water tank. The present owner has
owned the farm for 12 years. During that time, there were no known
anthrax cases. The soil is less than 2 feet deep and rocky, so it is
unlikely at this time that there are any prior unknown cattle graves
on this property. The last known anthrax cases in this part of Texas
were in the early 1970s, a time when there were various outbreaks
involving contaminated bone meal being fed along with salt to cattle.
With only 283 acres, this farm is probably a small part of what was
once a large cattle ranch; with soil that shallow one cannot be
raising crops. In Hill County, it has been customary to leave
carcasses to the buzzards.

According to the farm's veterinarian, the diagnoses provided on the 3
dead animals last fall were of "autolysis, salmonellosis, and heart
failure;" 2 of them could have involved sudden death, not unusual with
anthrax. There is no history this year (2011) or last of any earth
moving activities. So speculatively, the disease broke out last fall,
probably from an outbreak on a neighbouring premise, and this case is
just a delayed continuation. The stock are presently being vaccinated.
The veterinarian was advised to make sure that they are vaccinated for
at least 5 years and to get the stock on the neighbouring
establishments vaccinated as well and as soon as possible.

In 2010, the only known anthrax activity in Texas was in Val Verde
and Uvalde counties and involved deer and other ranch wildlife species
on speculatively 15-20 ranches. This most recent outbreak is unusually
far north in Texas, but in the past, there have been many outbreaks in
eastern Texas. - Mod.MHJ]
