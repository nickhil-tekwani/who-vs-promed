Virus Outbreak Nears Peak
-------------------------
This year's enterovirus epidemic will peak next week, a Department of
Health official predicted yesterday. Chiang Ying-lung, Deputy
Director-General of the Center for Disease Control, stated that the
epidemic, which broke out earlier than last year and is creeping up slowly,
will reach its peak in a week.
Enteroviruses infect the human gastrointestinal tract and often spread to
other areas of the body, especially the nervous system. The mortality rate
among children is high. So far 37 enteroviral cases have been identified
this year; 7 of the victims, all children, succumbed to the infectious disease.
The disease assumed epidemic proportions for the first time in Taiwan in
1998, claiming 70 lives. The nation has since experienced an enterovirus
epidemic each year. People should wash their hands often and refrain from
drinking untreated water to minimize the risk of contracting the highly
infectious disease, Chiang said.

[On the face of it the prediction that this outbreak of enterovirus
infection, with an apparent case-fatality rate of 20 percent, will reach
its peak in one week's time seems rash in the extreme. However, recent
outbreaks of hand, foot and mouth disease in this region, caused
predominantly by Enterovirus 71 infection, have been accompanied by a
severe form of brain-stem encephalitis associated with pulmonary edema and
high case fatality rates in a minority of children (see references below).
The presumption must be that the annual epidemic of hand, foot and mouth
disease in children expected in Taiwan at this time of year is approaching
its peak and the expectation is that the number of associated cases of
severe neurological disease will peak and decline in parallel. Further
information and clarification are requested. - Mods.MPP/CP]
