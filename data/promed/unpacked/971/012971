News of the response
Minister of health travels to Tchomia [Ituri]
---------------------------------------------
- On 4 Oct 2018, Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, minister of health, traveled to Tchomia in Ituri province with vice provincial governor Pacifique Keta and Congolese and international experts. The purpose of the trip was to assess the status of the Ebola response in the health zone and strengthen community engagement. The delegation visited the mobile laboratory of the National Institute for Biomedical Research (INRB), the new Ebola Treatment Center (ETC) under construction, and the port of Tchomia, where the minister talked with the young fishermen and travelers to encourage them to get involved and respect the preventive measures.
- In an interview with the local press, the minister regretted that despite the fact that more than 100 people have already died and more than 150 children have been orphaned or separated from their parents because of the epidemic, some people continue to doubt the existence of the disease. He added that whole families have disappeared because of this skepticism and resistance to rumors and misinformation. He reminded the journalists that their role was precisely to do this work of raising awareness and spreading the correct information.

Vaccination
-----------
- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 14 017 people have been vaccinated, including 4557 in Beni [North Kivu], 4254 in Mabalako [North Kivu], 1632 in Mandima [Ituri], 1283 in Katwa [North Kivu], 1014 in Butembo [North Kivu], 307 in Bunia [Ituri], 355 in Tchomia [Ituri], 270 in Masereka [North Kivu], 224 in Komanda [Ituri], and 121 in Oicha [North Kivu].

Situation update; data as reported by Tue 2 Oct 2018
----------------------------------------------------
The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo continues to be closely monitored, with the Ministry of Health, WHO, and partners making progress in response to the outbreak. Recent trends (figure 1 [see source URL above]) suggest that control measures are largely working, although these trends must be interpreted with caution. The outbreak remains active in Beni health zone [North Kivu], and additional risks remain following the confirmation of 2 EVD cases in Tchomia and one case in Komanda, both health zones in Ituri province. This is the 1st time that confirmed cases have been reported in Tchomia health zone, which borders Uganda, and in Komanda health zone. All of these cases have been linked to the ongoing transmission chain in Ndindi health area, Beni health zone.

Since WHO's last situation report on 25 Sep 2018 (external situation report 8), an additional 12 new confirmed EVD cases and 6 new deaths have been reported. A total of 17 new suspected cases are under investigation in Mabalako (8), Beni (7), Mandima (1) and Tchomia (1).

As of 2 Oct 2018, a total of 162 confirmed and probable EVD cases [N.B. MoH case number is 165 as of 3 Oct 2018], including 106 deaths, have been reported -- resulting in a global case fatality ratio (CFR) of 65.4%. Among the 162 cases, 130 are confirmed and 32 are probable. The CFR among confirmed cases only was 56.9% (74/130). The confirmed cases were reported from 9 health zones: Mabalako (69), Beni (38), Oicha (2), Masereka (1), Butembo (7), Kalunguta (1) [North Kivu], Mandima (9) Tchomia (2), and Komanda (1) [Ituri]. Cumulatively, 19 health workers have been affected, of whom 18 are confirmed cases; 3 health workers have died. All health workers' exposures occurred in health facilities outside the dedicated Ebola treatment centres (ETCs).

Among the 155 cases with known age and sex, 55% (n=86) are female. Among females, the most affected age group is 15-24 years, while among men the most affected age group is 35-44 years (figure 2 [see source URL above]).

As of 2 Oct 2018, 46 cases have recovered, been discharged from ETCs, and re-integrated into their communities. A total of 27 cases (10 confirmed and 17 suspected) remain hospitalized in the ETCs.

The epicentres of the outbreak remain Mabalako and Beni health zones in North Kivu province, reporting 56% (n=90) and 27% (n=43) of all confirmed and probable cases respectively. Beni is reporting an increasing number of all new cases, indicating the persistence of Ebola virus transmission in this area. The Beni health zone has reported 60% of all cases reported since early September 2018. Of the total deaths reported to date, 61.3% (n=65) were from Mabalako, while 27.4% (n=29) were from Beni. Additionally, 5 other health zones in North Kivu province and 3 in Ituri Province have reported confirmed and probable cases (table 1, figure 3 [see source URL above]).

The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO and partners are monitoring and investigating all alerts in affected areas, in other provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (including Kisangani and Tshopo provinces) and in neighbouring countries. Since the last report was published, alerts were investigated in several provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo as well as in Uganda and South Sudan and to date, EVD has been ruled out in all alerts from neighbouring provinces and countries.

On 25 Sep 2018, 3 refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo reported to be contacts of an EVD-confirmed case who died on 20 Sep 2018 in Tchomia health zone, Ituri province, arrived at the Sebagoro point of entry in Hoima District in Uganda, and are currently being monitored. [NB: Ebola update (103): Congo DR (NK,IT) cases, risk, response, research 20181003.6067199, the refugees actually attended a burial of an individual who was not infected with Ebola.]

Field activities were severely limited in Beni during the week of 24 Sep 2018 following a community-led declaration of "ville morte", a community-enforced general strike on all local activity. The declaration followed clashes between rebels and the Congolese armed forces, which took place on 22 Sep 2018. In solidarity with Beni, community leaders in Butembo and Mabalako health zones also declared a [general strike] that severely limited Ebola response activities in those health zones. Consequently, the proportion of contacts followed-up in Beni fell to a low of 20% on 23 Sep 2018. Activities resumed on 26 Sep 2018, but movement remained restricted in the city. As of 30 Sep 2018, a total of 1463 contacts remain under surveillance and 1355 (93%) have been followed.

- Thu 4 Oct 2018. DRC Ebola cases rise as security concerns continue
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Response and Policy) abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/10/drc-ebola-cases-rise-security-concerns-continue
[byline: Lisa Schnirring]

In updates yesterday and today [3, 4 Oct 2018], the Democratic of Republic of the Congo (DRC) reported 4 more confirmed Ebola cases, 3 of them in the current hot spot in Beni [North Kivu], and groups today raised more concerns about insecurity in the outbreak area. Violence includes another attack on a Red Cross safe burial team and escalating armed group attacks on Beni residents.

In a speech to the United Nations Security Council yesterday [3 Oct 2018], World Health Organization (WHO) director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the frequency and intensity of attacks by armed groups near Beni seem to be increasing. And he said responders are also worried about pockets of mistrust and the spread of Ebola into inaccessible "red zones" held by armed groups. "This spread is extending the long tail of the outbreak," he said, adding that the detection of cases near the Uganda border is also a big worry. [See full speech below in this post].

In other outbreak developments, the DRC health ministry said a man who is part of a pocket of community resistance who fled to Komanda [Ituri] where he sought treatment after his sister-in-law died in Tchomia [Ituri] was transferred to an Ebola treatment center in Beni [North Kivu]. His wife and child have been vaccinated and are in isolation at the same treatment center.

Also, officials said that, to show support for vaccination, North Kivu's governor along with 9 provincial deputies agreed to be immunized against Ebola, with the local press invited to document the event to help raise awareness and counter misinformation.

Burial team attacked
--------------------
Meanwhile, 3 Red Cross volunteers were injured on 2 Oct 2018, following an attack while conducting a safe and dignified burial in Butembo [North Kivu], the large city where several Ebola cases have been reported in recent weeks.

Two of the volunteers were seriously wounded and are being treated, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said today [4 Oct 2018] in a press release. The organization said Red Cross teams have faced incidents of violence and aggression from communities resisting burial protocols designed to limit the spread of the virus since the start of North Kivu province's Ebola outbreak.

The bodies of people who die from Ebola are highly infectious, and, in West Africa's 2014-16 outbreak, Red Cross burial teams played a critical role in curbing the spread of the disease. More than 180 trained Red Cross volunteers are working in the outbreak region, and teams have carried out 162 safe and dignified burials. The IFRC said that in September 2018 one Red Cross volunteer was hurt when people stoned a transport vehicle, but this week's attack was the most violent incident so far.

Fatoumata Nafo-Traoré, MD, the IFRC's regional director for Africa, said, "While we categorically denounce the attack on our colleagues, we understand the fear and frustration that many communities in North Kivu feel right now. People are scared and there are many rumours circulating that only serve to heighten the sense of fear and distrust."

Group urges probe of violence
-----------------------------
In another development, Human Rights Watch yesterday called on the International Criminal Court (ICC) to expand its Congo investigation to include attacks that have been occurring since 2014 in Beni, including one on 22 Sep that killed 17 civilians and temporarily brought the Ebola response in the hot spot to a halt. The group said that 2 days later fighters attacked the town of Oicha, abducting 16 people, most of them children.

According to its press release, Human Rights Watch said unidentified fighters have killed more than 1000 people in Beni [North Kivu] in massacres that began 4 years ago, and so far this year [2018], the violence has killed at least 235 people in more than 100 attacks. The group also called on the United Nations peacekeeping mission to boost its analysis capabilities and community engagement to identify who is responsible for the attacks and improve security for Beni's citizens.

Ida Sawyer, deputy Africa director for Human Rights Watch, said the brutal killings of Beni residents won't end until commanders of the responsible groups are brought to justice. "As Congolese authorities have not credibly investigated or prosecuted these atrocities, the International Criminal Court should investigate them for future trials," she said.

Human Rights Watch said the ICC has jurisdiction over serious international crimes committed in the Congo and has been investigating crimes there since 2004. Though the ICC has brought several cases to trial, the rights group said the court has not prosecuted recent crimes.

[3] WHO: Security Council meeting

UN Security Council meeting on the Ebola outbreak in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo
Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General, New York City, USA

Mr President, distinguished representatives of the Security Council,

Greetings from Geneva, and thank you for the opportunity of briefing you on the status of the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

I last briefed you in late August [2018], just a few weeks after I had visited Mangina [North Kivu], which was then the epicentre of the outbreak. I also visited Beni [North Kivu], which is the current epicentre and the base of our operations. I said then that I had returned from DRC more worried than before I went. I'm still worried.

When you visit DRC in the coming days, you will see with your own eyes the extraordinary challenges we face, and the equally extraordinary measures that the government, WHO and our partners are taking to bring this outbreak to an end. You will also see that we are now at a critical point in the outbreak.

I'd like to start today [3 Oct 2018] by giving you a brief update of the status of the outbreak and the response to it, before describing the challenges we are facing. So far there are a total of 161 confirmed and probable cases, and 106 deaths. There are 45 survivors and several people still under care. [NB MoH report 165 cases as of 3 Oct 2018. - Mod.LK]

The response to the outbreak is being led by the Government of the DRC, which is doing an outstanding job in an extremely difficult situation. The government is providing strong leadership and exemplary transparency -- they are reporting daily on the status of the outbreak. WHO has more than 200 staff on the ground, operating out of 4 hubs. We're also working very closely with MONUSCO [UN Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo], which is providing excellent support in an extremely challenging and dangerous environment. And we are working with numerous partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network in a coordinated way, under the government's leadership. So far, more than 13 700 people have been vaccinated using a ring vaccination strategy, and 47 people have been treated with investigational therapeutics.

I'm pleased to report that all 3 levels of WHO are well-aligned and working in harmony, from the country office to the regional office and headquarters. Most of our response staff come from the DRC Country Office and other duty stations throughout Africa.

Now let me describe some of the barriers we are facing.

First, the security situation. Even when I was in Beni at the beginning of the outbreak, there was an attack just 15 kilometres [9 mi] from the town. Since then there has been an increase in the frequency and intensity of attacks by armed groups in very close vicinity to Beni. These include a full-scale attack on the DRC armed forces base on 24 Aug 2018, ambushes on MONUSCO on 3 and 9 Sep 2018, a rocket explosion in the centre of Beni on 11 Sep 2018 and an indiscriminate attack on Beni town just 10 days ago, on 22 Sep 2018. As a result of the most recent attacks, which killed 21 people, our operations were in lockdown for several days. But when we're in lockdown, you know Ebola is not. Ebola gets an advantage. We have taken every possible measure to ensure that WHO staff are kept safe, but as we deploy more staff to the field, the risks increase of an accident, or a kidnapping, or one of our colleagues simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

The 2nd significant barrier we are facing is pockets of mistrust within some families. Community engagement is a critical part of any outbreak response and in general, we have been successful in engaging the community about how to prevent the transmission of Ebola. But we are now seeing pockets of community mistrust, especially around a village called Ndindi [North Kivu], which is where many of the most recent cases have occurred. Small but significant numbers of people refuse active follow-up, or refuse to be treated in the Ebola treatment units. We are working closely with religious leaders, youth and women's groups, and with the families themselves to overcome this obstacle.

Third, as a result of the security situation and the community mistrust, we are now seeing the spread of Ebola into red zones, and into areas bordering Uganda. The red zones are the areas which are inaccessible because they're occupied by armed groups. This spread is extending the long tail of the outbreak. Late last week [week of 24 Oct 2018] the DRC health ministry reported 2 cases from Tchomia health zone [Ituri], which is very near the border with Uganda.

For all of those reasons, last [Fri 28 Sep 2018] we increased our assessment of the risk of regional spread from high to very high. We are very concerned about the potential for the virus to spread into Uganda, but also into Rwanda, South Sudan, and Burundi. We are working very closely with those governments on operational readiness for Ebola. We still regard the risk of international spread outside Africa as low.

We have 2 main requests today.

First, we repeat our appeal to the Security Council to exercise every ounce of influence it has to ensure full, uninterrupted access to the affected areas, and to protect both the people of the region who are at risk of Ebola, and the responders who are trying to prevent the epidemic from continuing to spread. The security situation is to the advantage of the virus -- any hampering of the response allows the virus to spread unchecked. And that is a risk for all of us. We still remember the damage that happened by the Ebola virus in 2014-15 in West Africa.

And second, we thank all our international partners who responded to our 1st call for funding. It's now important to mobilise further funding for regional preparedness, particularly in Uganda but also in other neighbouring countries. To date, we have pledges for USD 8 million out of a request for USD 33 million for this critical work. Rest assured that we are working around the clock on the response, and doing everything within our power to bring this epidemic to an end. I am personally engaged in the response on a daily and sometimes hourly basis, because it's health security.

Finally, I would like to highlight the fact that this epidemic is occurring in the context of much wider humanitarian needs, in a country whose people have suffered enormously over several decades.

Thanks again for the opportunity of this briefing. I would be glad to answer any questions that you may have.

[4] Maniema province: Kindu Airport response
Date: Thu 4 Oct 2018
Source: Media Congo [in French, machine trans., abridged, edited]
https://www.mediacongo.net/article-actualite-43010_lutte_contre_ebola_des_dispositifs_d_hygiene_installes_a_l_aeroport_de_kindu.html


Health authorities are increasingly reinforcing the surveillance measures of the current epidemic to protect the population against its spread. Surveillance has been strengthened at entry points in Maniema province. The Health and Safety Brigade of the Provincial Health Division installed hygiene devices against Ebola fever at Kindu National Airport.

According to Damien Katenda, quoted by the Congolese News Agency, the installation of handwashing kits and of thermo-temperature monitoring is part of the fight against this disease in Maniema, one of the country's high-risk provinces because of travelers from infected provinces, including South Kivu, North Kivu, and the former Eastern province. Damien Katenda urged the workers at Kindu airport to make travelers aware of the strict rules of hygiene.
