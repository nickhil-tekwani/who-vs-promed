Rat fever (Leptospirosis) is rapidly spreading in the North Western
Province, a health official warns. According to Dr. Shama Seneratne
of the Kurunegala Epidemiology Unit, 55 people have died of the
disease, out of the 280 cases reported in 2008. She said the deaths
were reported mainly from Narammala, Pannala and Mawathagama MoH
areas of the Kurunegala district. The victims were in the age group
of between 25-29 years and included farmers, miners and those
involved in the clay industry.

Commenting on the disease, she said the symptoms included high fever
that continued for 5 to 15 days, severe headache, intense body/muscle
pain and jaundice. She emphasized if the high temperature continued,
hospitalization was a must as the disease could be fatal if not
treated properly.

"All steps should be taken to get rid of rats in houses, paddy fields
and marsh lands. Garbage disposal should be done in a way that it
does not encourage rat breeding because the disease can spread to
humans through garbage infected by rat urine. A person exposed to
water contaminated by the urine could get infected if he/she has an
open wound or drinks the contaminated water," she warned.
