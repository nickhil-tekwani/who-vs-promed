The Kadamjai District Hospital in Batken region admitted a teenager, aged 14, with suspected anthrax on 9 Sep 2014, the press service of the governor's office reported today [11 Sep 2014].

The boy found a sore on his hand on 30 Aug 2014 and tried to cure it by himself. On 9 Sep 2014, he went to the hospital, where he was immediately admitted in the infectious disease ward. Medical personnel made a preliminary diagnosis of anthrax and sent analyzes to the laboratory at Osh City.

The teenager was in contact with his classmates from 1-6 Sep 2014.

The governor's office ordered the district commission for emergencies to take the appropriate measures to prevent the infectious disease.

[This is a report out of the blue of a suspected case, yet to be laboratory confirmed, and with nothing to explain how it might have come about. But this part of Kyrgyzstan abuts the Fergana valley of eastern Uzbekistan, a region which has been suffering a number of scattered outbreaks recently (see the See Also list below), so there could easily have been related outbreaks in this part of Kyrgyzstan.

Batken forms the southern boundary of the Fergana valley of Uzbekistan, which is an area of chronic livestock outbreaks of anthrax. While Uzbekistan has, until recently, failed to report either human or livestock cases, they are routinely diagnosed in the surrounding Kyrgyz provinces. Unfortunately, these provinces are a long way from Bishkek and, therefore, do not get the oversight they need to have annual vaccination of their livestock. This would cost-effectively and cheaply prevent both livestock outbreaks and human cases.
