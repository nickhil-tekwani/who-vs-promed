Tanzania has confirmed 20 cases of leptospirosis, a bacterial infection that has claimed 3 lives, in the southern region of Lindi. Health minister Ummy Mwalimu said test results from samples of patients in Ruangwa were positive for the disease.

Last week [week of 11 Jul 2022], samples of people presenting with fever, nosebleeds, headache, and body fatigue tested negative for COVID-19, Ebola, and Marburg, the ministry said, calling for calm as it worked to detect it. "I would like to inform the public that sample testing from patients has confirmed the outbreak is leptospirosis field fever or 'homa ya Mgunda' as it is known in Swahili," said Ms Mwalimu on [18 Jul 2022].

According to the ministry, more than 20 cases have been reported, with 3 deaths. 2 patients are currently hospitalised. Ms Mwalimu said contact tracing was ongoing. "Up to now, no other person among contacts has shown any symptoms of the disease," she added.

According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), leptospirosis is a bacterial infection caused by bacteria of the genus _Leptospira_. The bacteria are transmitted from animals to humans through cuts or abrasions in the skin, nose, or eyes that come in contact with water or soil contaminated with the urine of infected animals. But, the disease cannot be transmitted from one human to another. In humans, it can cause a wide range of symptoms, some of which may be mistaken for other diseases.

The commonest symptoms are fever, headache, chills, cough, vomiting, diarrhoea, muscle pain, rash, red and irritated eyes, and jaundice.

In some cases, the disease can also lead to kidney or liver failure, meningitis and respiratory distress, which can turn fatal. Some infected persons, however, may have no symptoms at all, CDC says. A person is likely to present symptoms 2 days to 4 weeks after exposure. The illness usually begins abruptly with fever and other symptoms. A patient with fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, vomiting, or diarrhoea may recover for a time but become ill again. In more severe cases, the illness lasts from a few days to 3 weeks or longer. Without treatment, recovery may take several months.

Mild cases of leptospirosis can be treated using prescribed antibiotics. Hospitalisation along with intravenous administration of antibiotics is required in severe cases.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection that is widely distributed throughout the world in warm climates and is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. Leptospira bacteria shed in the urine of chronically infected animals may survive in freshwater or moist soil for weeks to months. Many species of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rats) are susceptible to chronic kidney infection with pathogenic leptospira. Mice, as well as rats, can carry leptospira in their urine and serve as a reservoir for this organism (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6612401/).

There are more than 250 serovars of _Leptospira_ species, with multiple serovars being endemic in a given geographic area. Protective immunity against leptospira infection is predominantly serovar-specific. Different leptospiral serovars may be prevalent in particular geographical regions.

Human activities that place people at increased risk of leptospirosis include contact with rats or domestic animals (cattle, pigs, and dogs), walking barefoot in water or mud, swimming in rivers and other water sports, gardening, or farming, and working in piggeries (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242886). Some names for leptospirosis are derived from the environmental situations associated with or groups at risk of developing the disease, such as swineherd's disease, rice-field fever, canecutter's fever or disease, swamp fever, and mud fever. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers. Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for a rodent infestation.

The diagnosis of leptospirosis requires confirmation by MAT (microscopic agglutination test) serology, but an IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), IgM dipstick, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been used to confirm the diagnosis (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3939550/). Dr Jan Clement has cautioned (see ProMED post Leptospirosis - Australia (03): (QL) comment 20210525.8380596) that Seoul hantavirus infection, also transmitted by rats, may be misdiagnosed as leptospirosis because its clinical manifestations mimic those of leptospirosis.

Treatment with antibiotics (penicillin and doxycycline) can be effective, especially if started early in the disease. Doxycycline (200 mg orally, once weekly) has been shown to be effective for short-term prophylaxis in high-risk environments (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM198402233100805) for those exposed to contaminated floodwater or soil (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2018/infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/leptospirosis). Each 200-mg dose provides a benefit for up to 7 days, so the dose may be repeated if high-risk conditions persist longer than this. However, a Cochrane review of clinical research testing whether taking doxycycline can prevent leptospirosis found that data from trials, which "targeted different kinds of people -- travelers and people who live in at risk areas, encompassing soldiers, farmers, and students -- did not support the practice in all cases, though short-term travelers with a potential for high-risk exposure may be helped." (https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007342.pub2)

Although vaccines are available for immunizing non-human animals against some serovars of _Leptospira_ and are available in some countries for humans, no vaccine against leptospirosis is available for use in humans in the US.

The news report above says that the diagnosis of leptospirosis was confirmed in 20 patients, 3 of whom died. We are, however, not told how the diagnosis was confirmed in these patients, or what factors put these people at increased risk for leptospirosis. More information, from knowledgeable sources, would be appreciated.

Ruangwa (population about 1.2 million residents), where the cases of leptospirosis are occurring, is one of six districts of the southern coastal Lindi Region of Tanzania (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruangwa_District). Lindi Region is one of Tanzania's 31 administrative regions (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindi_Region). - Mod.ML
