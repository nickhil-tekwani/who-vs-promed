PROVO Â— Utah County officials are asking the public to be on the alert
after two local men were definitively diagnosed with tularemia or
"rabbit fever."
Both men had been hunting recently and were probably exposed to the
rare bacterial disease the first part of July [2001, said Dr. Joseph
Miner, Utah County Health Department executive director. One was
bitten by deer flies while camping in Pinedale, Wyoming, and the other
reported handling a rabbit that may have been ill.
The disease, with fewer than 300 cases reported in the United States
each year, is potentially fatal and is usually spread through contact
with infected wild rabbits, ticks or deer flies. Muskrats and beavers
also can contract and spread tularemia.
Symptoms include the development of an ulcer at the site of the bite
within 3 to 10 days followed by swelling of the lymph nodes nearest
the site and headache, fever, malaise, and/or pneumonia.
The antibiotic most often used to treat tularemia is Streptomycin, a
drug not commonly prescribed for strep and staph infections, so
victims may lose time in getting effective treatment if not accurately
diagnosed promptly. [Streptomycin is no longer manufactured in the
USA. - Mod.JW
Miner said the 2 men who became ill went for several weeks without
being properly diagnosed because the disease is so rare. Both are now
responding to the antibiotic treatment.
However, Miner said it's essential the public be aware that the
disease exists and report any suspected cases to either the state
health department (801-538-6191) or to Utah County (801-370-8724).
Tularemia, along with plague, botulism, brucella and anthrax, is one
of the 5 infections considered most likely to be used as a
bioterrorism weapon through the air or water supply. "In light of
this, it's extremely important that health-care professionals and the
public notify us as soon as possible if any of these are suspected,"
Miner said.
It's also important to wear protective gloves or goggles when skinning
or handling wild game and to thoroughly cook the meat before eating.
