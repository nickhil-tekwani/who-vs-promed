["In March 2013 the Chinese Public Health authorities reported the 1st human cases of disease due to the infection with a type A influenza virus of the strain H7N9. This strain of virus usually infects birds, and the report was followed by reinforced surveillance in bird populations in China.

On 4 Apr 2013 the Chinese Veterinary authorities notified the occurrence of infection of pigeons and chickens with low pathogenic avian influenza virus H7N9 to the OIE, which is suggested as being very similar to the virus infecting humans.

As this low pathogenic AI virus does not cause severe clinical signs in animals, the disease was not diagnosed before specific laboratory diagnostic tests could be conducted." (http://tinyurl.com/zb57xlp).

Between April 2013 and August 2015 (date when the last report was sent to the OIE), 43 outbreaks of LPAI H7N9 were reported. The event was declared resolved and no more reports were submitted. See event summary and updated map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=13225.

All influenza A viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes, even if of low pathogenicity, must be reported to the OIE when detected in poultry due to their potential of mutating into highly pathogenic strains, as has occurred in China.

According to the media, "China has reported the 1st genetic mutation of the H7N9 bird flu virus with specialists predicting the change will result in more dead poultry. The Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention informed the World Health Organization that the mutation was found in samples collected from 2 patients in Guangdong province last month (January 2017). While there was no indication the mutation would have a greater direct impact on humans, it could lead to more infections in people, given the higher risk of infection among poultry." See, http://www.todayonline.com/chinaindia/china/mutation-h7n9-bird-flu-strain-found-guangdong-patients.

Although the report sent to the OIE does not mention the cases reported in humans, there is clearly a high association between the human cases reported in January 2017 and the detections of HPAI H7N9 found in live bird markets during this same time period. - Mod.CRD

According to information published on 19 Feb 2019 by China's CDC, the agricultural sector laboratory in Guangdong identified an apparent HPAI mutation of the H7N9 strain in 4 poultry specimens. The statement further indicated that China's health care system "will work together with the agricultural sector to identify the common source of the virus and continue to strengthen the monitoring of H7N9 virus, in order to timely detect any possible new variations." (http://www.chinacdc.cn/yw_9324/201702/t20170219_138185.html?from=timeline, in Chinese, machine translated). From the CDC information above, it may be assumed that the HPAI H7N9 strain, found in 4 samples from marketed poultry, is similar to the new HPAI mutation in human patients; this assumption needs to be clearly confirmed or otherwise. It further remains to be clarified which tests were used by the veterinary laboratory to define the mutant from poultry markets as being highly pathogenic for poultry, and whether mortality in poultry, related to the said mutant, has already been observed. - Mod.AS
