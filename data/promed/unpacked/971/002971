The Department of Health is today [Mon 5 Feb 2007] issuing the latest
information about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease. This includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
[abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD], the form of
the disease thought to be linked to BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy).
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK, as of Fri 2 Feb 2007
---------------------------------------------------------------
Summary of vCJD cases - deaths
------------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 112
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 46
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 0
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 158
Summary of vCJD cases - alive
-----------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 7
Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 165
(The next table will be published on Mon 5 Mar 2007).
Since the previous monthly statistics were released on Mon 8 Jan
2007, the total number of deaths from definite vCJD remains unchanged
and stands at 158. The overall total number of definite or probable
vCJD cases (dead and alive) is unchanged
These data are consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in the
UK is in decline. The peak number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000,
followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005,
5 in 2006 and so far none in 2007.
Totals for all types of CJD cases in the UK since 1995
------------------------------------------------------
As of Fri 2 Feb 2007, in the UK in the year 2007, so far there have
been 6 referrals, one death from sporadic CJD, one from iatrogenic
CJD, and none from familial CJD, variant CJD, or GSS.
During the period from 1995, when vCJD was first diagnosed, up to the
present, there have been 955 deaths from all forms of CJD including
the 158 deaths attributable to definite or probable vCJD. [These data

[3] 4th transfusion-associated case

4th case of transfusion-associated vCJD infection in the UK
----------------------------------------------------
A suspected case of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) has
recently been diagnosed in a patient in the United Kingdom (UK), who
received a blood transfusion from a donor who later developed vCJD
(1). This is the 4th case of probable transfusion transmission of
vCJD infection in the UK. Three of the 3 recipients developed symptoms of vCJD.
The 1st symptomatic case of vCJD associated with blood transfusion
was identified in December 2003. This individual developed vCJD 6.5
years after transfusion of red cells donated by an individual who
developed symptoms of vCJD 3.5 years after donation.
A 2nd case of vCJD "infection" was identified a few months later in a
person who had received red cells from a donor who developed symptoms
of vCJD 18 months after donation. This patient (the 2nd case) died
from causes unrelated to vCJD 5 years after transfusion. Post-mortem
investigations found abnormal prion protein in the spleen and a
cervical lymph node. However, prion protein was not found in the
brain, and no pathological features of vCJD were found.
A 3rd case developed symptoms of vCJD 6 years after receiving a
transfusion of red blood cells, and died 2 years and 8 months later.
The donor of the blood involved developed vCJD about 20 months after
donating it.
These 3 cases have been published as case reports and in the findings
of the ongoing collaborative study between the National Blood
Services, the National CJD Surveillance Unit, and the Office for
National Statistics. This study aims to collect evidence about
transmission of CJD or vCJD via the blood supply (2,3,4,5).
The new 4th case is in a patient who developed symptoms of vCJD 8.5
years after receiving a transfusion of red blood cells from a donor
who developed vCJD about 17 months after this blood was donated (1).
The donor to this case also donated the vCJD-implicated blood
transfused to the 3rd case. As for all other reported clinical vCJD
cases that have been tested for genotype, this patient is a
methionine homozygote at codon 129 of the prion protein gene. The
patient is currently alive.
All 4 cases had received transfusions of non-leucodepleted red blood
cells between 1996 and 1999. Since October 1999, leucocytes have been
removed from all blood used for transfusion in the UK. The effect of
leucodepletion on the reduction of the risk of transmission of vCJD
from an infective donation is uncertain.
This 4th case of vCJD infection associated with blood transfusion
further increases the level of concern about the risk of vCJD
transmission between humans by blood transfusion, although much
remains unknown. This reinforces the importance of the existing
precautions that have been introduced to reduce the risk of
transmission of vCJD infection by blood and blood products (6). No
cases of vCJD have been associated with fractionated plasma products.
The small group of living recipients of vCJD-implicated blood
transfusion in the UK have been informed of their potential exposure
to vCJD by blood transfusion, asked to take certain precautions to
reduce the risk of onward person-to-person transmission of vCJD
during health care, and offered specialist neurological evaluation and advice.

[4] Engineered resistance in cattle
Date: Tue 2 Jan 2007
From: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>

<http://www.reutershealth.com/en/index.html>

U.S. and Japanese scientists reported on Sun 31 Dec 2006 that they
had used genetic engineering to produce cattle that resist mad cow
disease. They hope the cattle can be the source of herds that can
provide dairy products, gelatin and other products free of the
brain-destroying disease, also known as bovine spongiform
encephalopathy or BSE.
Writing in the journal Nature Biotechnology, the researchers said
their cattle were healthy at the age of 20 months, and sperm from the
males made normal embryos that were used to impregnate cows, although
it is not certain yet that they could breed normally.
The cattle lack the nervous system prions, a type of protein, that
cause BSE and other related diseases such as scrapie in sheep and
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, known as CJD, in humans, the researchers
said. "(Prion-protein-negative) cattle could be a preferred source of
a wide variety of bovine-derived products that have been extensively
used in biotechnology, such as milk, gelatin, collagen, serum and
plasma," they wrote in their report.
Yoshimi Kuroiwa of Kirin Brewery Co. in Tokyo, Japan and colleagues
made the cattle, known as knockouts because a specific gene has been
"knocked" out of them, using a method they call gene targeting.
"By knocking out the prion protein gene and producing healthy calves,
our team has successfully demonstrated that normal cellular prion
protein is not necessary for the normal development and survival of
cattle. The cows are now nearly 2 years old and are completely
healthy," said James Robl of Hematech, a South Dakota subsidiary of Kirin.
"We anticipate that prion protein-free cows will be useful models to
study prion disease processes in both animals and humans," Robl, an
expert in cloning technology, said in a statement.
Misfolded prion proteins are blamed for BSE and other similar brain
diseases. It is known that certain genetic variations make animals
more susceptible to the diseases. BSE swept through British herds in
the 1980s and people began developing an odd, early-onset form of CJD
called variant CJD or vCJD a few years later. CJD normally affects
one in a million people globally, usually the elderly, as it has a
long incubation period. There is no cure and it is always fatal.
As of November 2006, 200 vCJD patients were reported worldwide,
including 164 patients in Britain, 21 in France, 4 in the Republic of
Ireland, 3 in the United States, 2 in the Netherlands and one each in
Canada, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Saudi Arabia and Spain. The disease
may have first started to infect cattle when they were fed improperly
processed remains of sheep, possibly sheep infected with scrapie.
Although people are not known to have ever caught scrapie from eating
sheep, BSE can be transmitted to humans. BSE occasionally occurs in
cattle outside Britain although it is now rare.

[5] Prion disease reversed

A man walks around the neighbourhood with his family, and stops to
admire a particularly lovely house. He turns to his family and asks
who built it. "You did," they reply.
It was the 1st sign that something was wrong, he would later recount
to researchers at the University of California, San Francisco. But it
was another half a year before he developed the classical erratic
behaviour and unsteady gait typical of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(CJD) -- a neurodegenerative condition caused by an infectious
protein called a prion.
A diagnosis of CJD is a death sentence, and researchers around the
world are looking for a cure. But that cure is unlikely to do much
good if doctors can't diagnose the condition in its early stages,
before the patient develops severe brain damage.
Now researchers have characterized the early signs of a similar prion
disease in mice. In results presented this week in Neuron1, the
researchers show that shutting-off production of the pathogenic
protein during these early stages allowed mice to not only survive,
but also recover normal brain function.
CJD occurs spontaneously in about one in every million people, and 90
percent of patients die within a year of their initial diagnosis.
Variant CJD occurs in a much smaller proportion of the population and
has been linked to infection by a prion found in cattle.
To investigate how the disease progresses, Giovanna Mallucci of the
Medical Research Council's Institute of Neurology in London and her
colleagues infected mice with an abnormal prion protein. Mice are
known to develop a neurological disorder from this treatment: 3
months after injection the mice stop grooming themselves; they then
develop an unsteady gait, and eventually die.
Mallucci's team monitored 2 other aspects of mice behaviour -- their
ability to remember familiar objects and their desire to burrow into
pellet-filled tubes. They found that infected mice began to lose
their ability to distinguish between new and familiar objects and
lost interest in burrowing around 8 weeks after infection -- well
before the classical signs of prion disease start to appear.
The mice were also engineered with a genetic trigger that allowed
researchers to shut off production of the prion protein. When this
was done in the 8th week after infection, the mice returned to normal
behaviour within a week. This was a surprise. Although Mallucci had
previously shown that shutting off the protein halted progression of
the disease, they did not know that the mice could also recover. "We
realized we weren't just prolonging survival," says Mallucci.
No one is proposing that humans be genetically engineered to turn off
prion production, but the results are encouraging, says Michael
Geschwind, a neurologist at the University of California, San
Francisco who was not involved in the study. "It's very hopeful," he
says. "It reinforces the notion that we have to develop methods for
making the diagnosis early."
Geschwind and his colleagues have surveyed hundreds of patients with
CJD, and have found that cognition and behaviour often show small
changes months before the disease is diagnosed. If an astute spouse
or physician could pick up on these early clues, then their
observations could be followed up, he proposes.
The results could have implications for other neurodegenerative
diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, says Howard
Federoff, a neurologist at the University of Rochester in New York.
But the complete reversal of early symptoms seen in mice may not be
reproducible in humans. The mice used in this experiment were young,
and their brains were probably in a better position to recover than
those of older mice. "While this is exciting, it may not work for
people who typically get CJD in their fifties and sixties," says
Federoff "there may not be enough plasticity even if they are caught early."
Furthermore, the genetic switch used in the mouse model depleted the
prion protein to levels that would be difficult to achieve using
drugs or other therapies. "I'm optimistic about these strategies,"
says Federoff, "but I think it's unlikely that we'll see the
remarkable reversal demonstrated in this paper."

[6] Prion disease reversed
Date: Thu 1 Feb 2007
From: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>

<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6314877.stm>

Prion diseases affect the brain. Symptoms of prion diseases, such as
the human form of mad cow disease vCJD, can be reversed, a study of
mice suggests. Medical Research Council scientists found memory and
behavioural problems could be tackled by stopping production of the
proteins corrupted in such diseases.
However, writing in Neuron, they warn the usefulness of the work for
humans depends on having a test for vCJD (variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease). vCJD, BSE in cattle and scrapie in sheep are all caused by
a build up of abnormally shaped versions of proteins called prions in
the brain. Normal prions have a very brief lifespan. But in prion
diseases, they become malformed and start to accumulate. They then
damage the synapses, which pass messages between nerve cells in the
brain, and eventually the cells themselves die.
The MRC team looked at mice which were in the early stages of a
vCJD-like disease and having problems with memory and behaviour. In
some of these mice, scientists then used an enzyme to switch off the
gene that makes the normal prion protein when the rodents are about 9
weeks old -- equivalent to adolescence. The animals were seen to
experience a reversal in their symptoms.
The animals regained memory of certain objects and restarted normal
behaviours, such as burrowing, which had stopped as their symptoms
emerged. However, in mice in which the gene was not switched off, no
reversal of symptoms was observed, and the animals went on to develop
severe symptoms and die.
The researchers, led by Dr Giovanna Mallucci, say it may be possible
to treat people in the early stages of prion disease. But they accept
that this relies on the development of a test to diagnose prion
diseases before the brain is permanently damaged. Dr Mallucci said:
"It's very exciting that nerve cell function is recovered and early
disease symptoms are reversed. "The challenge now is to be able to
detect early disease in humans and to develop treatments that can
remove normal prion protein."
Roger Morris, professor of molecular biology at King's College
London, said: "This is potentially very important work because it
shows something which we didn't expect and which could be extremely
significant." He said it appeared that in the early stages of prion
disease in the brain, synapses were frozen, rather than being
destroyed immediately; and that halting the process then allowed
function to be restored. "It means that the prospect of being able to
do something for people may be much better than we thought. We may be
able to reverse the behavioural effects."
