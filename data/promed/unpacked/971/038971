1300 cases of encephalitis reported in Gorakhpur
---------------------------------------------------------
In Uttar Pradesh, the deadly encephalitis is surging again as 3 more
patients have succumbed during past 24 hours in Gorakhpur.
Correspondent reports that of 1300 cases of acute encephalitis
syndrome 90 have been tested positive for Japanese encephalitis [JE]
since January this year [2010]. Rest of the cases were of water-borne
encephalitis. As many as 211 deaths have occurred in the eastern
districts due to the disease this year [2010].

The additional director (health) of Gorakhpur division U.K.
Srivastava said that the disease mainly spreads through the mosquito
bite and contaminated water.

[ProMED thanks Ronan Kelly for forwarding this report and the one
that follows. The previous report posted yesterday (28 Aug 2010]
indicated that there were 4 new deaths (see ProMED-mail archive no.
20100828.3065), not just the 3 as given in the above report. It would
be of interest to know which tests employed that were positive for JE
virus or antibody. Presumably "water-borne encephalitis" cases were
caused by some type of enterovirus. It would be of interest to know
which one(s).

[There were] 17 deaths in 72 hours; it is encephalitis nightmare in
Gorakhpur. All the beds at the Gorakhpur Medical College are taken,
mostly by children suffering from acute encephalitis syndrome [AES],
a more dangerous form of the disease than Japanese encephalitis.
"There are 2 times the numbers of patients of AES here in proportion
to JE. This one is worse because it ruins all these organs in the
body which JE didn't and that's why it's harder to save the patient,"
said Dr Khushwaha, HOD, Paediatrics Department, Gorakhpur medical college.

As per the nurses, 2 people die every day on an average due to
encephalitis in the Gorakhpur Medical College. A figure, which in
itself shows, how deep the roots of the epidemic have
reached. Also, In western Uttar Pradesh, 7 children have died and
another hundred are in the hospital in Moradabad. Though the cause of
death is not confirmed, the children were beleived to be suffering
from viral fever.

It is believed that encephalitis is caused due to mosquitoes that
breed in stagnant water. Hygiene is an important factor that plays a
great role in the spiraling of the disease.

In the last 32 years, more than 7000 people have died of encephalitis
just at the Gorakhpur Medical College Hospital. But, the centre is
still unable to devise a vaccination programme for Japanese
encephalitis which has already killed 200 this year. Even as cases
continue to pour [in], the centre has no idea about how to deal with
this outbreak. Adding to the misery is the fact that more rains are
expected in eastern Uttar Pradesh in the coming weeks. Something that
is indicative of only more despair.

[As in the 1st report above, there is no specific virus given as the
AES etiological agent involved in this outbreak. Samples should be
sent to a WHO virus reference center for virus identification. -Mod. TY]
