Hundreds have been affected by chikungunya [virus] in the district
with heavy rush of patients complaining of high fever and joint pains
reported in various hospitals and dispensaries. While officially 5
persons have died so far, unofficial reports put the toll at 15.

While the disease is not responding to conventional treatment, health
authorities have sent fresh blood samples to Bhubaneswar for test.
Last month [October 2007], the dreaded virus was detected in 27 blood
samples out of the total 31 sent for test. Worst hit were 2 villages
in Nimapara block.

Within a span of 45 days after detection of 1st case in Vailipur
village under the Nimapara PHC [primary health center] the virus now
has spread its tentacles to almost all blocks.

However, CDMO [chief district medical officer] Trilochan Boral put up
a brave front by saying the disease would be contained. Inordinate
delay in examining the blood samples in a Bhubaneswar lab was the
biggest impediment in the containing the spread of the dreaded virus,
doctors said.
