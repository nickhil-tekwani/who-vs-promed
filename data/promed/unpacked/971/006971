An interesting ongoing dialog relating to striking the balance
between wildlife and domesticated livestock with regard to
brucellosis surrounding the Yellowstone in the USA -- some thoughts
from a position of comparative ignorance on the other side of the world.

There has been a quite a lot said about the pro's and con's
surrounding 'artificial feeding grounds' for the key wildlife
reservoirs (elk, bison). Given the known mechanisms of _Brucella_
transmission, I wonder whether or not it may be practical to put a
little more emphasis on management of 'breeding' grounds (including
most probable 'aborting' grounds) rather than being quite so heavily
focused on (winter) feeding grounds. Better focus on exposure around
the likely worst times for exposure (aka abortions by recently
infected cases and normal birthing by chronically infected cases) in
seasonal breeding reservoirs might result in useful changes to
artificial feeding practices/regimes, better timed measures in nearby
grazing country to protect livestock, and also target (obviously very
costly) inputs more strategically for enhanced impact.

to speak, from current position. - Mod.TG]
