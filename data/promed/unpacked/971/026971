The 1st case of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in the past 12 years has
occurred in Bulgaria on Wednesday [5 Jan 2011].

A wild boar with FMD has been killed in the region of the
southeastern Bulgarian city of Burgas. A 10 km [6 mi] security zone
has been established and all vehicles passing through the region are
being disinfected. All living animal trade in the Burgas region has
been stopped.

The European Commission has already been informed about the accident.

FMD is highly contagious and, while it is not so dangerous for
humans, a possible outbreak may cause severe economical damages, the
Bulgarian Agriculture Minister Miroslav Naydenov has explained.

"Bulgaria may face a ban on the export of animal products if the
disease is to spread," Naydenov has said.

Several centers of infection have already been registered in Turkey.

FMD is a sometimes fatal viral disease of cloven-hoofed animals,
including domestic animals such as cattle, water buffalo, sheep,
goats, and pigs. Humans are very rarely affected.

[The city of Burgas can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail
interactive map of Bulgaria at <http://healthmap.org/r/0lnP>.

Official notification and data on the FMDV serotype involved are anticipated.

Most likely, the origin of infection is on adjacent Turkish Thrace
territory. As known from WRLFMD data, FMDV serotypes O (topotype
ME-SA, strain PanAsia-2) and A (topotype Asia, strain Iran-05) are
circulating in Turkey. For data on recent isolates received from
Turkey at the Pirbright laboratory and their genotyping results,
subscribers may refer to <http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/me/tur.htm>.

The possible role of wild boars in the epidemiology of FMD,
particularly in the Middle East, has been discussed in the past (for
example, ProMED-mail posts 20070517.1571 and 20090222.0734). Wild
boar populations in Turkey and Bulgaria are considered to be
relatively dense (see map at
