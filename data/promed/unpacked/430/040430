Local health officials are cautioning local residents about the
presence of Q fever in the community, as several patients have been
identified and treated at the Myrtue Medical Center.

"Recently, several cases of Q fever have been identified in our area,
and we would like to provide some information about the
disease and sources of additional information," said Myrtue Medical
Center Community Health Director Vickie Gillespie [see comment below].

[ProMED-mail would appreciate more information regarding the number
of cases and the potential exposures. Aerosolization of the organism
with substantial spread distance wise occurs so that the cases did
not need to have direct contact with the animal reservoir.

_Coxiella burnetii_, the causative agent, was discovered in 1937.
This organism is an agent that can be resistant to heat and
desiccation, and is highly infectious by the aerosol route. A single
inhaled organism may produce clinical illness. Indeed, in [non-human]
primates, the dose to kill 50 percent of the primates was found to be
1.7 organisms (1).

Cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_.
Infection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals,
including other species of livestock and in domesticated pets. _C.
burnetii_ does not usually cause clinical disease in these animals,
although abortion in goats and sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_
infection. Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of
infected animals. Most importantly, during birthing the organisms are
shed in high numbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta.
Contact with contaminated wool is known to be a mode of transmission
(2).

The organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common
disinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long
periods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is
associated with compact small cell variants of the organism that are
produced during standard replication along with the less resistant
large cell form, metabolically dormant, and spore-like (3).

Infection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms
from air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried
placental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd
animals. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very
few organisms may be required to cause infection.

Ingestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and
inspiration of the contaminated food, is a less common mode of
transmission. Other modes of transmission to humans, including tick
bites and human-to-human transmission, are rare.
