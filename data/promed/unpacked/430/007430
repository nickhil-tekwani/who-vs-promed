MOSQUITO VIRUSES ON THE INCREASE IN AUSTRALIA
Arboviruses (mosquito borne) are spreading and becoming established in new
areas, which is of growing concern, according to the latest edition of the
Communicable Diseases Intelligence (CDI), the official journal of the
Communicable Diseases Network Australia New Zealand (CDNANZ).
In a special edition of the CDI which reviews arboviruses in the Australian
region from 1990 to 1998, communicable diseases experts express concern
that the flaviviruses, Murray Valley encephalitis, Kunjin, Japanese
encephalitis and dengue virus types 1, 2 and 3 and the alphaviruses, Ross
River and Barmah Forest, are causing significant human disease in Australia.
"All of these viruses have been responsible for human infections over the
past decade. Each has its own specific ecological and epidemiological
characteristics and each has demonstrated a propensity to spread and become
established in new areas, which is of growing concern." according to the
authors.
Examples are the recent occurrence of the first case of Japanese
encephalitis acquired on the Australian mainland, the continuing outbreak
of dengue type 3 in Cairns, and the acquisition of Ross River virus
infection in western Sydney in 1997.
Dr Cathy Mead, Head of the National Centre for Disease Control in the
Federal Department of Health and Family Services, which produces the CDI,
said the arboviruses reports in the journal were of particular significance
because they provided a useful and timely review of arboviral infections in
Australia and the neighbouring region in recent years.
"For example there is a report on the first case of Murray Valley
encephalitis in Alice Springs in over 20 years," she said.
"There is also information on three cases of dengue in Australians
returning from Thailand. This highlights the importance for all
Australians to take appropriate care when travelling in dengue endemic
countries.
"There is an article which illustrates the complexity of diagnosis of
flavivirus infection and the importance of considering the clinical,
epidemiological and laboratory information for each patient before reaching
a final diagnosis.
"For additional interest, we have also reproduced an article about the
recent dengue 3 outbreak in Cairns."
Dr. Mead said Australia, through the work of various health authorities, is
well prepared for dealing with outbreaks of mosquito borne disease.
"This includes the efforts of local authorities and States and Territory
communicable disease units who are equipped to respond to mosquito borne
disease outbreaks," she said.
"They deliver prompt evaluation of concerns and provide vital and
appropriate information to the public about protective measures.
"At a national level, the Communicable Diseases Network Australia New
Zealand meets regularly to discuss current disease issues, including
mosquito borne viruses. This national collection of medical and
epidemiology experts shares information and develops a coordinated national
response to outbreak situations."
The CDI provides up to date information on the public health aspects of
communicable diseases in Australia through a combination of peer-reviewed
articles, short outbreak reports, commentaries and surveillance data and
reports.
The CDI is produced every four weeks and can be accessed on the internet on
the Communicable Diseases Australia homepage:
