[In a news release from the national Dutch avian influenza laboratory, Wageningen Bioveterinary Research (WBVR), dated 15 Dec 2016, HPAI H5N5 was identified in one tufted duck found dead in Werkendam. The findings in other 3 tufted ducks from the same consignment were: in 2 birds, HPAI H5N8 and in the remaining one, both H5N5 and H5N8 were identified. It was not clear if the H5N5 virus, found for the 1st time in wild birds in the Netherlands, has already or will spread further in the Netherlands. The H5 sequence in the H5N5 virus was found to be identical to the H5 in the H5N8 virus. The origin of the viruses is under investigation (see https://www.wur.nl/en/article/Bird-flu-HP-H5N5-in-tufted-duck.htm. Thanks to Nati Elkin for the submission of this information).

In 2016 the Netherlands has reported 2 HPAI events associated with subtype H5N8.

The 1st event was reported on 15 Nov 2016, when HPAI H5N8 was found in wild birds involving to date (15 Dec 2016) 16 outbreaks. This event is continuing. See report and updated map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=21515

The 2nd HPAI H5N8 event was reported on 28 Nov 2016 in domestic birds involving to date (15 Dec 2016) 4 outbreaks. This event is also continuing. See report and updated map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=21698. - Mods.AS/CRD
