UNDIAGNOSED DIE-OFF, MALLARD - USA (IDAHO)

The posting "Undiagnosed die-off, mallard - USA (ID) 20080317.1039" sent
out on 17 Mar 2008, and apparently from a news item dated 15 Mar 2008, was
actually a story dated 15 Dec 2006. It referred to an incident we had
covered in ProMED-mail at the time.

We regret the error and any confusion it may have caused, and thank those
readers who noticed it.
