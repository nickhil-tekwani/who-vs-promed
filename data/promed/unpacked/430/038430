Avian influenza situation in Egypt - WHO Update 26
-------------------
The Ministry of Health of Egypt has reported a new laboratory
confirmed human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) on Sat 19 Dec 2009.

The case is a 21-year-old female from the El Tanta District of
Gharbia Governorate. She developed symptoms of fever and cough on Tue
15 Dec 2009. She was admitted to Tanta Fever Hospital where she
received oseltamivir treatment on the same day. She is in a stable
condition. Investigation revealed that the case had close contact
with dead poultry and was involved in slaughtering sick birds.

The case was confirmed by the Egyptian Central Public Health
Laboratories, a National Influenza Center of the WHO Global Influenza
Surveillance Network (GISN).

Of the 90 laboratory confirmed cases of avian influenza A(H5N1)
reported in Egypt, 27 have been fatal.

2009, only 4 have been fatal, possibly as a result of immediate
resort to oseltamivir treatment.
