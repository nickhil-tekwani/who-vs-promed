As many as 45 students at UW-Madison [University of Wisconsin,
Madison] are sick with the norovirus. Many of the students live in
the Sellery dormitory.

Symptoms of norovirus illness usually include nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, and some stomach cramping. Those affected can also have a
low-grade fever, chills, headache, muscle aches and a general sense
of tiredness.

Health officials aren't considering it an outbreak because the virus
has been contained.

[Noroviruses are classified in the genus _Norovirus_ of the family
_Caliciviridae. They are a genetically diverse group of
single-stranded RNA, non-enveloped viruses that can cause acute
sudden-onset gastroenteritis in humans. Noroviruses are transmitted
primarily through the fecal-oral route, either by consumption of
fecally contaminated food or water, or by direct person-to-person
spread. It is not clear in the Wisconsin situation whether the
outbreak is food-borne or mediated by person-to-person contact. The
incubation period is brief, and illness, though disabling, is
short-lived. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate
that 23 million cases of acute gastroenteritis are due to norovirus
infection and that at least 50 percent of all foodborne outbreaks of
gastroenteritis can be attributed to norovirus contamination.

It is difficult to assess the seriousness of the University of
Wisconsin outbreak because the number of students residing in the
Selleny dormitory is not given.

Madison and the state of Wisconsin can be located using the
