[1] China (Wuhan): testing
Date: Tue 3 Aug 2021

Authorities in Wuhan have announced that they will test its entire population for COVID-19 after the central Chinese city where the coronavirus first emerged reported its first local cases in more than a year and the country moved to stamp out numerous outbreaks connected with the delta variant.

The city of 11 million is "swiftly launching comprehensive nucleic acid testing of all residents", senior Wuhan official Li Tao said told the media on Tuesday [3 Aug 2021]. Authorities announced on Monday [2 Aug 2021] that 7 locally transmitted cases had been found among migrant workers in the city, breaking a year-long streak after it squashed an initial outbreak with an unprecedented lockdown in early 2020.

China has confined the residents of entire cities to their homes, suspended domestic transport links and rolled out mass testing in recent days as it battles its largest coronavirus outbreak in months. Nationwide, China reported on Tuesday [3 Aug 2021] at least 90 new confirmed COVID-19 cases in the mainland as of 2 Aug 2021, compared with 98 a day earlier, according to the National Health Commission (NHC). That brings to more than 400 the number of cases in the last 10 days.

Of the newly confirmed cases, 61 were locally transmitted, the health authority said, compared with 55 local cases a day earlier. A total of 45 local patients with symptoms were reported in the eastern Jiangsu province, with 5 in Nanjing city and 40 in Yangzhou city, the provincial government said on Tuesday [3 Aug 2021]. Six locally transmitted cases were detected in Hunan province and 3 in Hubei province, NHC data showed. Hubei province said all 3 of those patients were found in the capital Wuhan city. No new deaths were reported.

China's Yunnan province in July [2021] reported a COVID-19 outbreak due to the delta variant. Yunnan shares a border with Myanmar, where coronavirus infections have surged.

"What's concerning about this outbreak is that how widespread it has become," said Al Jazeera's Katrina Yu from Beijing, noting that 16 provinces have reported cases in the last 10 days. As of 2 Aug 2021, mainland China had recorded 93 193 confirmed cases, with the cumulative death toll unchanged at 4636, the NHC said on Tuesday [3 Aug 2021].

The more than 1.3 million residents of Yangzhou's city centre are now confined to their homes, with each household allowed to send only one person outside per day to shop for necessities, the city government said on Tuesday [3 Aug 2021]. The announcement follows similar moves in Zhangjiajie, a popular tourist destination in central China's Hunan province, as well as nearby Zhuzhou city affecting more than 2 million people in total.

The outbreak spread to Hunan from Nanjing last month [July 2021] after people linked to a cluster at Nanjing airport attended theatre performances in Zhangjiajie. Officials have since been tracking down thousands of people who attended the show and urging tourists not to travel to areas where cases have been found.

Meanwhile, Beijing has blocked tourists from entering the capital during the peak summer holiday travel season and asked residents not to leave unless necessary, with top officials promising over the weekend to "spare no expense" in defending the capital city. Beijing city, Shanghai city and Fujian province each detected one local case as of 2 Aug 2021.

China had previously boasted of its success in bringing domestic cases down to virtually zero after the coronavirus first emerged in Wuhan, allowing the economy to rebound. But the latest outbreak is threatening that success with more than 400 domestic cases reported since mid-July [2021]. On Monday [2 Aug 2021], the state-owned Global Times quoted the country's top epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan as saying that China needs to vaccinate about 83% of its population to achieve herd immunity.

[Testing is informative only on the particular day each individual gets tested because they may be harboring the virus before viremia becomes detectable. Testing every individual is the only approach that will detect asymptomatic cases, but a major undertaking which China has attempted in the past.

According to the country's top epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan, as stated above, China needs to vaccinate about 83% of its population to achieve herd immunity. It is not clear how close to that goal China is and whether they will decide to lock down again.

Additional background information reported by Forbes (https://tinyurl.com/28uny9u7): "The Chinese National Health Commission (NHC) reported 90 new confirmed COVID-19 cases on Tuesday, 61 of which have been locally acquired. Since the start of the pandemic in Wuhan in late 2019, China has reported 93 193 COVID-19 cases and 4636 deaths in total. After the initial outbreak, the country's authorities used stringent lockdown measures and large-scale testing to stomp out the local spread of the virus in the country. But the emergence of the more contagious delta variant is likely to seriously test China's 'zero COVID' strategy and it may force authorities to reinitiate lockdowns. The emergence of the more infectious version of the virus is also expected to put further strain on the Chinese economy, which grew slower than expected in the recently concluded April-June quarter." - Mod.LK]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
-------
Background: COVID-19 is a complex disease targeting many organs. Previous studies highlight COVID-19 as a probable risk factor for acute cardiovascular complications. We aimed to quantify the risk of acute myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke associated with COVID-19 by analysing all COVID-19 cases in Sweden.

Methods: This self-controlled case series (SCCS) and matched cohort study was done in Sweden. The personal identification numbers of all patients with COVID-19 in Sweden from 1 Feb to 14 Sep 2020 were identified and cross-linked with national inpatient, outpatient, cancer, and cause of death registers. The controls were matched on age, sex, and county of residence in Sweden. International Classification of Diseases codes for acute myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke were identified in causes of hospital admission for all patients with COVID-19 in the SCCS and all patients with COVID-19 and the matched control individuals in the matched cohort study. The SCCS method was used to calculate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for first acute myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke following COVID-19 compared with a control period. The matched cohort study was used to determine the increased risk that COVID-19 confers compared with the background population of increased acute myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke in the first 2 weeks following COVID-19.

Findings: 86  742 patients with COVID-19 were included in the SCCS study, and 348  481 matched control individuals were also included in the matched cohort study. When day of exposure was excluded from the risk period in the SCCS, the IRR for acute myocardial infarction was 2.89 (95% CI, 1.51-5.55) for the 1st week, 2.53 (1.29-4.94) for the 2nd week, and 1.60 (0.84-3.04) in weeks 3 and 4 following COVID-19. When day of exposure was included in the risk period, IRR was 8.44 (5.45-13.08) for the 1st week, 2.56 (1.31-5.01) for the 2nd week, and 1.62 (0.85-3.09) for weeks 3 and 4 following COVID-19. The corresponding IRRs for ischaemic stroke when day of exposure was excluded from the risk period were 2.97 (1.71-5.15) in the 1st week, 2.80 (1.60-4.88) in the 2nd week, and 2.10 (1.33-3.32) in weeks 3 and 4 following COVID-19; when day of exposure was included in the risk period, the IRRs were 6.18 (4.06-9.42) for the 1st week, 2.85 (1.64-4.97) for the 2nd week, and 2.14 (1.36-3.38) for weeks 3 and 4 following COVID-19. In the matched cohort analysis excluding day 0, the odds ratio (OR) for acute myocardial infarction was 3.41 (1.58-7.36) and for stroke was 3.63 (1.69-7.80) in the 2 weeks following COVID-19. When day 0 was included in the matched cohort study, the OR for acute myocardial infarction was 6.61 (3.56-12.20) and for ischaemic stroke was 6.74 (3.71-12.20) in the 2 weeks following COVID-19.

Interpretation: Our findings suggest that COVID-19 is a risk factor for acute myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke. This indicates that acute myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke represent a part of the clinical picture of COVID-19 and highlights the need for vaccination against COVID-19.

Implications of all the available evidence
------------------------------------------
The evidence indicates that acute cardiovascular complications might represent an essential clinical manifestation of COVID-19 and the long-term effects might be a challenge for the future. These findings could change clinical practice and warrant a prioritisation of preventive and diagnostic strategies, which can affect treatment and, therefore, reduce the burden of morbidity and mortality in this patient group.

[B] Research: COVID-19 an independent driver for heart attack and stroke
Date: Mon 2 Aug 2021
Source: Medscape [abridged, edited]
https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/955855


New data from Sweden provide the strongest evidence to date that COVID-19 is an independent risk factor for acute myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemic stroke. The risk for acute MI and ischemic stroke increased by roughly 8-fold and 6-fold, respectively, in the 1st week following onset of COVID-19 when day 0 (exposure day) was included in the analysis. Even when day 0 was excluded (reducing the risk for bias), the risk for acute MI and stroke was increased by roughly 3-fold.

"The fact that the risk is still increased even when day 0 is excluded indicates that COVID-19 is indeed an independent risk factor for acute MI and ischemic stroke," senior author Anne-Marie Fors Connolly, with Umea University, Sweden, told theheart.org/Medscape Cardiology. "Our results indicate that acute cardiovascular complications might represent an essential clinical manifestation of COVID-19 and the long-term effects might be a challenge for the future," she and her colleagues say.

Previous studies that have suggested that COVID-19 is a "probable" risk factor for acute cardiovascular complications involved relatively few hospitalized patients. In what is believed to be the largest study to date to investigate this association, Swedish researchers linked data from national registers for outpatient and inpatient clinics and the cause of death register for all 86 742 patients (median age, 48 years; 43% male) with COVID-19 between 1 Feb and 14 Sep 2020, and 348 481 matched control patients.

They used 2 methods to assess the association of COVID-19 with risk for acute MI and stroke. One was a self-controlled case series (SCCS) method, which was used to compare incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for 1st acute MI and stroke before and after patients were determined to have COVID-19. The other was a matched cohort study, which determined the odds of acute MI or stroke in the 14 days after COVID-19 onset in comparison with control individuals who had not been diagnosed with COVID-19.

Because the date of infection was unknown, the researchers identified the closest date possible and denoted it as day 0 (exposure date). There was a large peak in cases of both acute MI and ischemic stroke recorded on day 0, they report. "The day 0 has been a cause of discussion between clinicians and statisticians during this study," Connolly told theheart.org/Medscape Cardiology. "The clinicians (myself included) argued that all events should be included, since we believe it is part of the clinical disease presentation," she explained.

But Paddy Farrington, professor emeritus and statistician of the Open University, in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom, and "an important collaboration partner on our study," argued that day 0 should be excluded because it represents a bias -- seeking healthcare likely precipitates testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection and therefore introduces a test bias that potentially inflates the observed risk, Connolly explained. The observation that the risk for acute MI and stroke remains elevated when day 0 is excluded shows that COVID-19 is an independent risk factor for acute MI and ischemic stroke, she emphasized.

In the matched cohort study, for each weighted Charlson comorbidity index point, the odds of acute MI and ischemic stroke increased approximately 40%. Hence, the findings reinforce the importance of getting vaccinated against COVID-19, particularly for elderly people with comorbid conditions, "to avoid potential acute cardiovascular events," Connolly said. Acute MI and stroke "could be an extrapulmonary manifestation of COVID-19; therefore, this is good to keep in mind for clinicians who see these types of patients," she added.

The authors of an accompanying comment note that the transient increase in the risk for MI and stroke in association with influenza, pneumonia, acute bronchitis, and other chest infections has been known for decades. "It seems reasonable to infer that the persistence of risk for several weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection is consistent with COVID-19 causing an increased risk of thrombo-occlusive disease, as has been reported for other respiratory infections," write Marion Mafham, and Colin Baigent, of the University of Oxford, UK. They note, however, that the absolute risks are "small". They also write that further studies are needed to evaluate the time course of increased cardiovascular risk for patients with COVID-19 and to investigate possible mechanisms. "However, it is important to keep in mind that the excess risks of myocardial infarction and stroke in a person with COVID-19 are substantially smaller than those resulting from respiratory failure," Mafham and Baigent say.

[3] USA: Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)
Date: Mon 2 Aug 2021
Source: Medpage Today [abridged, edited]
https://www.medpagetoday.com/opinion/second-opinions/93834


In recent months, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has reported higher-than-ever rates of COVID-19 among people in its custody. Since February [2021], the COVID-19 positivity rate among those held by ICE has doubled. Today, according to our tracking of the outbreaks, the positivity rate among people in ICE detention is more than 50 times the positivity rate of the US population at large.

What is underlying this surge? For one, ICE is finally testing its detained population more widely, so it's possible that what appears to the outside as a surge is actually just a clearer picture of what's been happening all along. Since the start of the pandemic, the agency has been severely undertesting, in some cases deliberately, and thus obscuring the true extent of COVID-19 spread among both detained people and staff. In May 2020, the agency was only testing roughly 1 in 5 detained individuals; a year later, testing has improved 4-fold.

But it's likely that the apparent surge in COVID-19 infections is driven at least in part by skyrocketing numbers of people being held in ICE detention. Even while the positivity rate has continued to grow, the agency is returning to pre-pandemic detention levels, nearly doubling the number of people in its custody to over 27 000 in just a few months. In doing so, ICE has dramatically increased population density inside its facilities, with the primary source of the increase being growing transfers from Border Patrol custody. On top of this, more transmissible variants may be contributing to the rapid spread.

With a large and still growing number of people held in close quarters in its detention centers, ICE is inviting continued deadly outbreaks. Our research has made clear that people living or working in carceral settings are far more likely to become infected with COVID-19 than those in outside communities.

Meanwhile, ICE is only now, several months into the pandemic, beginning to offer COVID-19 vaccines to those in its custody. For months, the federal agency had refused to offer vaccines to people they detain, leaving it up to each state government to vaccinate those in ICE custody. Predictably, this has led to low vaccination rates: In May [2021], only 20% of detained immigrants had received at least one dose of vaccine compared with 60% of all US adults. And even now, despite ICE's most recent offering of 10 000 vaccines, it is unclear how the agency intends to ensure a fair distribution and equal access to vaccines.

[Just as in prisons and other crowded facilities, basic hygiene must be practiced in the detention centers, and public health measures must be implemented -- that is, masking, physical distancing, isolation and quarantine protocols. Vaccination must be conducted, probably most easily with a single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine. It is immoral to detain individuals in facilities where they are almost guaranteed to get sick. - Mod.LK]
