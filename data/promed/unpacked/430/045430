Proteolytic Inactivation of MAP-Kinase-Kinase by Anthrax Lethal Factor

Anthrax lethal toxin, produced by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_, is the
major cause of death in animals infected with anthrax. One component of this
toxin, lethal factor (LF), is suspected to be a metalloprotease, but no
physiological substrates have been identified. Here it is shown that LF is a
protease that cleaves the amino terminus of mitogen-activated protein kinase
kinases 1 and 2 (MAPKK1 and MAPKK2) and that this cleavage inactivates
MAPKK1 and inhibits the MAPK signal transduction pathway. The identification
of a cleavage site for LF may facilitate the development of LF inhibitors.

MICROBIOLOGY: New Clue to How Anthrax Kills [Science editorial]
Evelyn Strauss
On page 734 [Science 1 May 1998; 280 (5364):734] , a research team reports
identifying a possible mechanism of action for "lethal factor" (LF), a
toxic protein produced by the anthrax bacillus that is thought to be one of
the principal causes of death in
infected individuals. The team has found that LF cleaves and inactivates an
enzyme in one of the cell's key signaling pathways, the mitogen-activated
protein kinase pathway, which helps control cell growth, embryonic
development, and the maturation of oocytes into eggs. The discovery could
someday give doctors a new countermeasure against the disease that is
directed against the toxin, thereby reducing the threat of its use as a
germ warfare agent.

Dr. George F. Vande Woude, a National Cancer Institute researcher and
co-author of a study to be published in the journal Science was cited as
saying today that researchers have discovered how anthrax toxin destroys
cells and rapidly causes death in an important step toward finding drugs to
protect against some biological weapons, adding, "An inhibitor drug would
make anthrax as a weapon as useful as a water pistol."
Col. Arthur M. Friedlander, an Army anthrax researcher, said the NCI's
discovery about anthrax is significant in understanding how it kills. But he
cautioned that more than a single antitoxin may be needed to disarm anthrax.
"It is not just that toxin that kills in this disease," he said. "But this
offers a new approach that may lead to other inhibitors that would work."
Weapons experts consider anthrax weapons, which are much easier to make and
distribute than nuclear weapons, to be a major threat to civilian
populations and troops in the field. Iraq's capacity to make anthrax has
been a major concern of United Nations weapons inspectors working there.
Immediate treatment crucial to survival.
The story notes that anthrax toxin consists of three proteins, and early
research showed that one of the proteins, called Lethal Factor, or LF, was
the major cause of cell death. But what science didn't know until now is how
LF actually killed the cells.
Vande Woude, Duesbery and their colleagues found that LF disrupts a
signaling system in cells called the MAP-Kinase-Kinase (MAP-K-K) pathway.
When this system is blocked, said Duesbery, a cell "is cut off from the
world." Its metabolism shuts down and it can no longer divide. The toxin
also causes the massive release of an inflammation protein and destruction
of immune system cells called macrophages.
The result, said Duesbery, is rapid shock and death. In laboratory
experiments, he said, "rats are quite dead within just 40 minutes" when
injected with anthrax toxin.

[As George commented, this only holds the promise of such an inhibitor. It
has yet to be developed. Within the anthrax research field such inhibitors
have been in discussion for some time now. While the writers have jumped on
the BW/Military aspects, a more important advantage of such a chemical would
be in the day-to-day treatment of human cases worldwide, which are in the
range of 1,000 - 3,000 per year. If cheap enough, it would have a place in
treating livestock. -Mod.MHJ]
