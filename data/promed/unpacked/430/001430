With New Virus, Experts Suspect More Died of Encephalitis
----------------------------------------------
Public health officials are investigating whether as many as 8 more people
than previously reported have died of encephalitis in New York City's
outbreak.
Until Sunday, local health officials had attributed 3 deaths to the
epidemic, with 15 more people infected in New York City and Westchester
County. The disease, they said, was St. Louis encephalitis.
But now that additional laboratory tests have detected the presence of a
different virus in some of those who died during the outbreak, officials are
confronting the possibility that the scope of the epidemic may may be
greater than they first thought.
Dr. Neal L. Cohen, the New York City Health Commissioner, said Sunday that
blood and spinal fluid samples from 77 people who tested negative for St.
Louis encephalitis would now be re-examined for the new virus, identified as
the West Nile virus, or a close variant known as the Kunjin virus.
Seven of those 77 people later died, but their deaths were not publicly
attributed to the epidemic because they had tested negative for St. Louis
encephalitis, Dr. Cohen said. Now that tests have indicated the presence of
the West Nile or Kunjin virus in one of the 7 people who died after testing
negative for St. Louis encephalitis.
Kristine A. Smith, a spokeswoman for the State Department of Health, said
Sunday that a total of 8 deaths during the outbreak have been "associated
with clinical encephalitis symptoms." Three of those deaths, she said, were
reported to state officials late last week.
In all, Dr. Cohen said, city officials are now investigating whether the
West Nile or Kunjin viruses were present in 11 of the people who died during
the outbreak. He cautioned, however, that several of those deaths may not be
related to encephalitis.
Brain samples from 7 people who died have been sent, or are en route, to the
Emerging Diseases Laboratory at the University of California at Irvine, said
W. Ian Lipkin, director of the center. This is the laboratory that last week
first identified the virus as either the West Nile, found in Africa, or the
Kunjin, found in Australia. Neither virus has ever been detected in the
Western Hemisphere.
Late on Friday, the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also
detected a West Nile-like virus in brain tissue extracted from one person
who died, confirming the initial results from the California lab. The CDC
has also detected the virus in dead birds found in the New York City region.
Taken together, the findings have caused public health officials to revisit
many of the same questions they were asking at the outset of the epidemic in
August: Where did it come from? How widely has it spread?
In a news conference Sunday, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani acknowledged that the
health toll may turn out to be higher now that scientists are focusing on a
different disease.
"What we anticipate is over the next day or two they probably are going to
reclassify a number of cases as West Nile fever that previously had not been
found to be St. Louis encephalitis," he said. "These are not new cases," he
added. "These are reclassifications of old cases. And in most situations,
the people have already been released from the hospital, and there may be a
few fatalities that had been borderline
cases that will be described as West Nile fever."
Barbara Stewart, a spokeswoman for the CDC, said that the initial tests were
not as precise as subsequent tests. What's more, she said, results from the
early tests were difficult to interpret because of the close similarities
between various strains of viruses that can result in encephalitis. "It's a
question of reading the strength of the reactivity,"
she said.
While the discovery of a new virus in this hemisphere is considered
scientifically significant, Mayor Giuliani said it had no practical impact
on the city's response to the outbreak. "The things that we have to do
about it are exactly the same," he said
yesterday. "So although there is a reclassification of the disease, the
things that the city or any city would have to do are essentially the same.
You have to spray to reduce dramatically the insect population. Both
diseases are carried in the same way -- by birds to mosquitoes and then to
human beings. And the symptoms, although not as severe, are roughly the
same, so the treatment is essentially the same."
