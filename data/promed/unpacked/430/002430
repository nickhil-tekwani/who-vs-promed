Update: Influenza Activity --- United States and
Worldwide: 22 Mar to 3 Sep 2005, and 2005/2006
Season Vaccination Recommendations
---------------------------------------------------
Influenza A (H3N2) viruses circulated worldwide,
and Influenza A (H1)* and B viruses were reported
less frequently during the period 22 May to 3 Sep
2005. In North America, isolates of influenza A
(H3N2), A (H1), and influenza B were identified
sporadically. This report summarizes influenza
activity in the United States and worldwide since
the last MMWR update.�
United States
-------------
In the United States, the CDC uses 7 systems for
national influenza surveillance, including the
following 4 that operate year-round: 1)
collaborating laboratories of the World Health
Organization (WHO) and the National Respiratory
and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS)
report the number, types, and subtypes of
influenza viruses detected; 2) approximately 2250
sentinel health-care providers report patient
visits for influenza-like illness (ILI), and
approximately 500 of these providers continue
regular reporting throughout the summer; 3) 122
U.S. cities report mortality attributed to
influenza and pneumonia on a weekly basis; and 4)
a national surveillance system records pediatric
deaths associated with laboratory-confirmed
influenza (1).
During the period 22 May to 3 Sep 2005,� WHO and
NREVSS collaborating laboratories tested 14 016
respiratory specimens; 120 (0.9 percent) were
positive for influenza. Of the positive results,
66 (55 percent) were influenza B viruses, 33 (28
percent) were influenza A (H3N2) viruses, one
(0.8 percent) was an influenza A (H1) virus, and
20 (17 percent) were influenza A viruses that
were not subtyped. The majority (78 percent) of
these isolates were tested from mid-May through
late June, during which time 1.3 percent of
specimens tested were positive for influenza.
Since July, 0.4 percent of specimens tested were
positive for influenza.
During the period 22 May to 3 Sep 2005, the
weekly percentage of patient visits to sentinel
providers for ILI remained below the national
baseline of 2.5 percent� and ranged from 0.7
percent to 1.3 percent. The percentage of deaths
attributable to pneumonia and influenza (P&I) as
reported by the 122 Cities Mortality Reporting
System remained below the epidemic threshold,**
and no influenza-related pediatric deaths were
reported as occurring during this period.
Worldwide
---------
During the period 22 May to 3 Sep 2005, influenza
A (H3N2) viruses predominated in Asia (China,
Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, and Thailand). Influenza
A (H3N2) viruses were also identified in Oman and
Singapore. Influenza A (H1) viruses were reported
in China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Korea, and Malaysia. Influenza B viruses were
reported in China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea,
Nepal, Philippines, and Thailand.
In Oceania, during the same period, influenza A
(H3N2 and non-subtyped) viruses predominated in
Australia; influenza B viruses were responsible
for outbreaks in New Zealand. Influenza B viruses
were also reported in Australia and New
Caledonia. In Africa, both influenza A virus
subtypes (H3N2 and H1) and influenza B viruses
were reported in South Africa, and influenza A
(H3N2) and influenza B viruses were reported in
Madagascar. Influenza B viruses also were
reported in Kenya.
In South America, influenza A (H3N2 and
non-subtyped) viruses were associated with
regional outbreaks in Argentina and Chile during
the period 22 May to 3 Sep 2005 and were reported
in Brazil, Colombia, Peru, and Uruguay. Influenza
B viruses were associated with an outbreak in
Colombia in July and also were reported in
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay. Influenza
A (H1) viruses were reported in Peru. In North
America, influenza A viruses (H3N2 and
non-subtyped) and influenza B viruses were
reported in Canada, Mexico, and the United
States. The United States reported one influenza
A (H1) virus. Influenza A (H3N2) viruses also
were reported in El Salvador and Panama (2--4).
Characterization of Influenza Virus Isolates
--------------------------------------------
The WHO Collaborating Center for Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and Control of Influenza, located
at CDC, analyzes influenza-virus isolates
received from laboratories worldwide. During the
period 22 May to 3 Sep 2005, a total of 77
influenza A (H3N2) viruses (47 from Latin
America, 21 from Asia, 8 from the United States,
and one from Oceania) were collected and
characterized antigenically. All 77 influenza A
(H3N2) viruses were antigenically related to the
A/California/07/2004 reference virus. However, 4
South American viruses and 9 Asian viruses had
reduced titers to A/California/07/2004. An A/
California/07/2004-like virus was recommended as
the H3 component for the 2005--06 Northern
Hemisphere vaccine. No influenza A (H1) viruses
collected during this period were received and
characterized by CDC.
Influenza B viruses circulating worldwide can be
divided into 2 antigenically distinct lineages:
B/Yamagata/16/88 and B/Victoria/2/87. Before
1991, B/Victoria lineage viruses circulated
worldwide; from late 1991 to early 2001, no
viruses of the B/Victoria lineage were identified
outside Asia. However, since March 2001,
B/Victoria-lineage viruses have been identified
in many countries outside Asia, including the
United States. Viruses of the B/Yamagata lineage
began circulating worldwide in 1990 and continue
to be identified. The type-B component of the
2005--06 influenza vaccine
(B/Shanghai/361/2002-like) belongs to the
B/Yamagata lineage. Of the 46 influenza B
isolates collected during the period 22 May to 3
Sep 2005 and characterized antigenically at CDC,
3 belonged to the B/Yamagata lineage, and 43
belonged to the B/Victoria lineage. All 3 of the
B/Yamagata-lineage viruses had reduced titers to
B/Shanghai/361/2002. 2 of the B/Yamagata-lineage
viruses were from Asia, and one!
was from the United States. Of the 43
B/Victoria-lineage viruses, 18 came from Asia, 18
from South America, and 7 from the United States.
Avian Influenza A (H5N1)
-------------
Since December 2003, a total of 11 countries
(Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Japan, Kazakhstan,
Laos, Malaysia, Russia, South Korea, Thailand,
and Vietnam) have reported outbreaks of highly
pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus
affecting poultry. Russia and Kazakhstan reported
outbreaks of H5N1 virus among poultry for the 1st
time in late July 2005 (5). Mongolia reported
detection of H5N1 virus in migratory birds in
August (6). In Southeast Asia, where H5N1
continues to be detected among poultry,
approximately 150 million birds have died or been
culled since 2003 (5).
Since December 2003, a total of 112 H5N1 cases in
humans have been reported to WHO in 4 countries
(Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam); 57
(51 percent) persons died. In August 2005, 3
cases (including 2 deaths) were reported in Viet
Nam. In July, one fatal case was reported in
Indonesia (5).
Influenza Vaccine Supply and Recommendations
--------------------------------------------
Vaccination is the primary method for preventing
influenza (1). For the 2005/2006 influenza
vaccine, 4 manufacturers expect to provide
influenza vaccine to the U.S. population. Sanofi
Pasteur, Inc., projects production of up to 60
million doses of trivalent inactivated influenza
vaccine (TIV). Chiron Corporation projects
production of 18--26 million doses of TIV.
GlaxoSmithKline, Inc. projects production of 8
million doses of TIV. MedImmune Vaccines, Inc.,
producer of the nasal-spray, live attenuated
influenza vaccine (LAIV), projects production of
approximately 3 million doses (7). Because of the
uncertainties regarding production of influenza
vaccine, the exact number of available doses and
timing of vaccine distribution for the 2005/06
influenza season remain unknown. As a result, CDC
recommends that only the following priority
groups receive TIV before October 24, 2005:
persons aged >65 years with comorbid conditions;
residents of long-term--care facilities; persons
aged 2!
--64 years with comorbid conditions; persons
aged >65 years without comorbid conditions;
children aged 6--23 months; pregnant women;
health-care personnel who provide direct patient
care; and household contacts and out-of-home
caregivers of children aged <6 months
These groups correspond to tiers 1A--1C in the
previously published table of TIV priority groups
in the event of vaccination supply disruption
(8). Beginning 24 Oct 2005, influenza vaccine
should be made available to all persons. Healthy
persons aged 5-49 years who are not pregnant,
including health-care workers who are not caring
for severely immunocompromised patients in
special-care units, can receive LAIV at any time
(1).
Vaccination Recommendations for Persons Displaced by Hurricane Katrina
--------------------------------------------------
On 6 Sep 2005, CDC issued interim vaccination
recommendations for persons displaced by
Hurricane Katrina (9). Any displaced persons
aged >6 months living in crowded group settings
should be administered influenza vaccine;
children aged <8 years should be administered 2
doses, at least 1 month apart.

MMWR Editorial Note
-------------------
During the period 22 May to 3 Sep 2005, influenza
A (H3N2) viruses were the most frequently
reported virus worldwide; however, influenza A
(H1) and influenza B viruses also circulated. In
North America, sporadic cases of influenza were
identified each month. The identification of
influenza isolates and even sporadic outbreaks in
the summer in North America is not unusual.
Neither the influenza virus that will predominate
in the United States nor the severity and timing
of the 2005/2006 season can be predicted.
The ongoing widespread epizootic of highly
pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses in
Asia remains a major public health concern. Since
December 2003, a total of 12 countries have
reported H5N1 outbreaks in poultry or migratory
birds, with human cases reported from 4 of these
countries. Since July 2005, H5N1 infections in
poultry and migratory birds have spread beyond
their initial focus in Southeast Asia to
Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and Russia; a human case
was reported in Indonesia for the 1st time. No
evidence of sustained person-to-person
transmission has been identified to date,
although probable limited person-to-person
transmission has been reported (10). To date, no
evidence has indicated genetic reassortment among
avian influenza A (H5N1) and human influenza A
viruses. CDC recommends enhanced surveillance for
suspected H5N1 cases among travelers with
unexplained severe respiratory illness returning
from H5N1-affected countries. Additional

Footnotes
---------
* Includes both the A (H1N1) and A (H1N2)
influenza virus types. Although H1N2 viruses have
not been identified since February 2004, not all
isolated H1 viruses have been tested for the
subtype of their neuraminidase. Thus, H1N2
viruses might continue to circulate in some parts
of the world. Influenza A (H1N2) viruses appear
to have resulted from reassortment of the genes
of the circulating influenza A (H1N1) and A
(H3N2) subtypes. Because the hemagglutinin
proteins of the A (H1N2) viruses are similar to
those of the circulating A (H1N1) viruses, and
the neuraminidase proteins are similar to the
circulating A (H3N2) viruses, the 2005--06
influenza vaccine should provide protection
against A (H1N2) viruses.
