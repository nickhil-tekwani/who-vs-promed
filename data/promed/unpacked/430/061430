AFLATOXIN POISONING, FATAL - KENYA

The Minstry of Health has confirmed 16 deaths due
to aflatoxin poisoning in 3 districts of Eastern
Province in Kenya: Kitui, Machakos and Makueni.
A total of 40 patients have been admitted to the
district hospitals with symptoms suggestive of
aflatoxin poisoning. The aflatoxin poisoning was
due to eating contaminated maize.
The last outbreak in 2004 caused over 130 deaths;
since then the Ministry of Health and Ministry of
Agriculture had put in a surveillance system to
identify cases as well measure levels of aflatoxin in maize.
There is a clustering of cases in residents of
the same household, all of whom shared the same
maize stored from last year�s harvest. It is most
likely that poor storage conditions in households
led to high levels of aflatoxin in the maize.

[Aflatoxin is a naturally occurring mycotoxin
produced by 2 types of mold: _Aspergillus flavus_
and _Aspergillus parasiticus_. _A. flavus_ is
common and widespread in nature and is most often
found when certain grains are grown under
stressful conditions such as drought. The mold
occurs in soil, decaying vegetation, hay, and
grains undergoing microbiological deterioration
and invades all types of organic substrates
whenever and wherever the conditions are
favorable for its growth. Favorable conditions
include high moisture content and high
temperature. At least 13 different types of
aflatoxin are produced in nature, with aflatoxin
B1 the most toxic. While the presence of _A.
flavus_ does not always indicate harmful levels
of aflatoxin, it does mean that the potential for
aflatoxin production is present.
(<http://www.usda.gov/gipsa/newsroom/backgrounders/b-aflatox.htm>)
Aflatoxins are acutely toxic and have been shown
to be carcinogenic for humans. Animals are
susceptible to acute liver damage and death when
exposed to high doses, but seldom develop cancer
following long-term low-level exposure. The
toxicity varies between different species, but
data from a large outbreak of poisoning in India
in 1974, which involved moldy maize and in which
nearly 100 people died, suggests that the
toxicity of aflatoxin B1 for humans lies
somewhere between that for the dog and that for
the rat. The involvement of aflatoxins with
human cancer is more complex and remains to be
defined (<http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/capacity/en/2.pdf>).
It is possible that the problem reported above is
from last year�s harvest or improper storage
within the home. It does seem that some of the
surveillance is working, as the numbers affected
are lower than in the past. - Mod.TG]
