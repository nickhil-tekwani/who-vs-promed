Crops infected with fungi after heavy rain
-------------------------------------------
Apparently, Huancayo was not the only area affected by heavy rains last
week since about 21 000 hectares of maize cultivated in the district of
Hualhuas were affected by the fungus mildew, according to the local mayor,
Emilio Torres Ramos.

Ramos called on the regional director of agriculture for technical
assistance and support to combat the disease. If farmers do not receive any
help, they could have greater losses. He said to keep in mind that they and
all their families are dependent on farming, and it will be difficult to
start over in that situation. Sector authorities have a big task on their
hands.

[Of the 2 types of mildew diseases, powdery and downy, only downy mildew
fungi are known to occur on maize. Downy mildews are important pathogens of
the crop in many tropical regions of the world. For example in Asia, losses
in excess of 70 per cent have been documented. Around 10 different species
of downy mildew fungi in the genera _Peronosclerospora_, _Sclerospora_, and
_Sclerophthora_ have been reported to affect maize. A number of these
pathogens can occur together, but different species may be common in
different areas.

Symptoms of the different fungi are similar, although they can vary with
plant age, climatic conditions, and host germplasm. Infection at the
seedling stage results in stunting, chlorosis, and premature plant death.
Infection of older plants results in leaf symptoms of mottling, chlorotic
streaking, lesions, and may produce white striped leaves which eventually
shred. "Downy" growth often occurs on leaves and is more common on the
lower leaf surface. Plants may be stunted, tiller excessively, have
malformed tassels and ears, and may not produce seed.

Downy mildew spores are spread within a crop mainly by splashing rain,
wind, or mechanical means. The fungi survive between crops on infected
plant material or alternate weed hosts. Some of the pathogens can also be
seedborne, although this is largely restricted to seed that is fresh and
has a high moisture content. Downy mildews are usually controlled with
fungicides.
