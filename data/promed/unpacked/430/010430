A horse in Clark County [Wisconsin] got infected with West Nile virus and became the 1st this year [2017] to be euthanized because of the mosquito-transmitted virus, the state Agriculture Department said [Mon 24 Jul 2017].

The yearling Standardbred cross gelding had not been vaccinated against the disease, said Dr Julie McGwin, state equine program veterinarian. "It's been a very wet summer so far this year [2017], which contributes to a growing mosquito problem," she said in a statement.

West Nile virus is caused by a virus transmitted by mosquitoes, and may cause encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain, and is fatal to horses in 90 percent of cases, McGwin said. Symptoms in horses include depression, appetite loss, drooping eyelids and lower lip, fever, weakness, twitching, paralysis or lack of coordination, aimless wandering, circling, and blindness.

The virus is not contagious between horses, but can be carried by mosquitoes from an avian, or bird, host to horses and humans. The virus does not pass directly between people and horses. Mosquitoes biting warm-blooded animals is the only route of transmission.

Horses that have not already been vaccinated this year [2017] for West Nile virus or other mosquito-borne diseases are at greater risk, McGwin said. "Those horse owners who have vaccinated should check with their veterinarians to see whether a booster is appropriate."

[Take note: this valued horse got sick, incurred vet bills, and then had to be put down, which makes it all very expensive. It could have been prevented if the horse had been vaccinated in the spring. We report only those cases that get into print, so check with your veterinarian to see if cases have been seen in your area. If so, get your horses booster shots. -Mod.MHJ
