The Chikungunya disease [virus], which is
believed to have infected the people of Kampung
Rasau [in Slim River, Perak], has spread to at
least 5 other nearby villages, Slim assemblyman
Datuk Mohd Khusairi Abdul Talib said.

Khusairi, who visited some of the villagers
seeking treatment for prolonged fever and joint
pains at the health polyclinic here, said he was
concerned about the feedback he was getting from
villagers.

"From what I know, it started at Kampung Rasau
near here," he said Monday [28 Jul 2008] after
visiting one of the patients warded at the
hospital.

"Now I am getting feedback that it has spread to
nearby villages such as Ulu Slim, Slim Village,
Bandar Baru Slim River, Kuala Slim, Kampung
Bantang, and TrolakÂ’" he added.

Khusairi, who got a briefing about the disease
from a doctor at the polyclinic, said whole
families were reporting that they were down with
prolonged fever, rashes, and joint pains. "This
is worrying and villagers from nearby kampung
(village) are now complaining of having the same
symptoms," he added.

He said he hoped more doctors could be assigned
to the health polyclinic to help out for the time
being. Last week [21-27 Jul 2008], the polyclinic
was treating between 25 and 30 patients with the
same symptoms, he said, adding that this week,
the number of patients was on the rise.

He also advised the people to get rid of
mosquito-breeding grounds in the area. Khusairi
said he had been informed that the health
authorities had been fogging the area to rid the
place of mosquitoes.

The Health Ministry's disease control director
Datuk Dr Hasan Abdul Rahman had reportedly
confirmed that the ailment was the mosquito-borne
chikungunya virus.
