[Of course, it is important to confirm that this is H5N1. There are
a couple of other important pieces of information in this report,
however. First, the disease is widespread throughout Indonesia, with
127 outbreaks in 56 districts. Moreover, a quick check of the map
reveals wide geographic distribution for these outbreaks, covering
major parts of the 3 biggest islands -- Java, Sumatra, and Borneo.
Finally, 2.2 million birds affected is a large number to be involved
in outbreaks. This report indicates only 4.7 million have been
depopulated. That still leaves a large reservoir or "mixing bowl"
for this particular virus to circulate in.
Hopefully, further updates will reveal sustained progress in
eliminating the risk by depopulating the birds. We shouldn't forget
the economic challenges involved in such massive culling, and support
from all corners is an absolute necessity. - Mod.PC]
