First Report of Shoot Blight of Grapevine Caused by _Sclerotinia
sclerotiorum_ in Chile.
B. A. Latorre and M. J. Guerrero, Facultad de Agronomía e Ingeniería
Forestal, Pontificia Universidad Catolica, Casilla 306-22, Santiago, Chile.
Plant Dis. 85:1122, 2001; published on-line as D-2001-0820-03N, 2001.
Accepted for publication 2 Aug 2001.
[In early spring grapevine (_Vitis vinifera_ L.), cv. Red Globe in
northern Chile was found with [shoot blight symptoms ... (elongated
cankered lesions surrounded by water-soaked tissues...mainly) at the base
of new shoots. The distal part of the shoots withered. Symptoms were
similar to the shoot blight caused by _Botrytis cinerea_ [Bc Pers. early
in the spring, except that superficial gray sporulation was always absent.
Isolation on acidified potato dextrose agar (APDA) consistently yielded a
fungus that ... was identified as _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_ [Ss (Lib.) de
Bary (2). [In pathogenicity tests new shoots were inoculated by inserting
a 4-mm plug of mycelium from actively growing cultures [into ... the base
of each of 5 shoots per cultivar with a sterile scalpel. Inoculated wounds
were sealed with Parafilm tape to avoid ... dehydration. Inoculated plants
and [controls (equal number of wounded but not inoculated plants of each
cultivar were) maintained in a screenhouse.
Inoculations of grapevine cvs. Thompson Seedless, Flame Seedless, Red
Globe, Ribier, and Chardonnay with Ss isolates SC-1, SC-2, and SC-3 and Bc
(isolate BC1-3 from grapevine) resulted after 7 days of incubation in
canker lesions that were similar to those observed in the field. Cankers
caused by Ss varied significantly (P < 0.05) in length [between cultivars.
Mature berries of "Flame Seedless" table grapes were surface-disinfected
with 1% NaOCl for 1 min, punctured with a sterile needle, and inoculated
with a mycelium plug. All Ss isolates and the Bc isolate were pathogenic on
mature berries, which developed a soft rot and superficial mycelium after 5
days of incubation at 25°C in humid chambers. Reisolations from diseased
shoots and rotten berries were successfully performed on APDA.
We concluded that Ss and Bc could cause canker lesions on new shoots early
in the spring. Ss has been previously associated with soft rotting of
mature berries of grapes worldwide (1).
To our knowledge, this is the first confirmed report demonstrating that Ss
can cause shoot blight. Considering that grapevines are cultivated on
2-m-high trellises in Chile, we speculate that wind disseminated ascospores
may infect shoots. However, ascocarps have not yet been found in vineyards
in Chile.
