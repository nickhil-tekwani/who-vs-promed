Dear Sir/ Madam,
In the posting " Trypanosomiasis, canine - Uruguay: 20171202.5478928" it is mentioned that "_Trypanosoma evansi_, the causal agent of Surra, is a salivarian African trypanosoma introduced in America during the 15th century

However _T. evansi_ is transmitted mechanically by biting flies and is not really a salvarian trypanosome.

The term salvarian should be reserved, to the best of my knowledge, for trypanosomes transmitted by the anterior station (hence salvarian) of Glossina spp of tsetse flies.

Desquenesnes et al, in the article Trypanosoma evansi & Surra A review, 2013 (Desquesnes M et al. _Trypanosoma evansi_ and surra: a review and perspectives on transmission, epidemiology and control, impact, and zoonotic aspects. Biomed Res Int. 2013;2013:321237; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3789323/) mention only mechanical transmission of this trypanosome by tabanids and other haematophagous flies. No mention of the tsetse fly is made, which is a biological vector of African trypanosomes, except _T. evansi_.

Could a mistake have been made here?

Regards,

[ProMED thanks Lennox Applewhaite for his comments. We entirely agree that _T. evansi_ is transmitted mechanically and not through the salivary glands and therefore cannot be called a salvarian trypanosome.
