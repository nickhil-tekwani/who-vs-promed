A Correction: USAMRIID is the Address for Bioagent Information
---------------------------------------------------------------
The correct Army resource for smallpox information, and other bioagents is
USAMRIID (US Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Disease).
USAMRCID deals primarily with chemical agents. However, the email address
(<http://ccc.apgea.army.mil>), which Maj. Bruce provided in the ProMED-mail
post Smallpox, bioterrorism response plan - USA (04) 20011130.2920, does
provide a link to USAMRIID.

Priorities in Defining a Bioterrorism Response Plan
---------------------------------------------------
Steve Toovey [in the ProMED-mail post entitled Smallpox, bioterrorism
response plan - USA (05) 20011201.2926 raised the issue of the use of
malaria in the treatment of syphilis. He asks if there is a "senior
clinician" who remembers. A clinician I am not, senior I am. As a medical
student in 1946-47 malaria was still being used to treat neurosyphilis at
the University of Michigan, as was a fever therapy produced by a big black
box. In the days of uncontrolled clinical trials it was observed that there
was frequently a remission. I am also old enough to remember that
neurosyphilis would frequently remiss on its own.
This whole line of reasoning is interesting but misses the point of response
to a smallpox bioterror incident. Who is going to prepare, stockpile and
distribute [interferon-gamma? Are we going to have the luxury of controlling
patient temperature? If we really believe that the risk of such an attack is
real and we have an unprotected population, shouldn't we be thinking of how
to quarantine New York City for 21 days? How do we feed 7 million people who
normally buy 2 days worth of food? Is the risk of a bioterror smallpox
incident great enough that pre-attack immunization is indicated? These are
the type of issues that need to be faced rather than concern about treatment
of cases.

[Dr Sencer's comments are perceptive and hopefully will be considered by
those drafting future bioterrorism response plans. I judge this to be an
appropriate point to cut this thread. - Mod.CP
