New rule relaxes Brunswick's rabies control measures [Readers please note: This is only a rule in North Carolina. - Mod.TG]

Brunswick County Commissioners adopted a new rule for management of animals exposed to rabies.

A new rule relating to management of animals exposed to the rabies virus has been adopted by the county.

The rule change puts new exposure management control measures in place that shortens the amount of time exposed animals spend in quarantine.

The previous rule required euthanasia or a 6-month quarantine period for non-vaccinated dogs or cats, or dogs and cats that were overdue for a rabies vaccination, if they were exposed to the virus.

Though the option of euthanasia is continued under the new process, the adopted control measures call for a 4-month quarantine period versus a 6-month period. Additionally, exposed animals with overdue vaccinations with appropriate documentation could remain under at-home observations for 45 days.

"The proposed rabies control measures largely relaxes some of the existing standards that we have for rabies control in North Carolina," said David Stanley, Brunswick County's health and human services director.

Stanley said the rule change was proposed following the National Association of State Public Heath Veterinarians' 2016 Rabies Compendium, when new national guidance for post-exposure management control measures for dogs and cats was introduced.

The new measures continue to protect the public's health while using the most "current science" to deal with management of the virus, Stanley said.

A baby raccoon in Beaufort County has exposed 2 people to rabies, according to the South Carolina [SC] Department of Health and Environmental Control [DHEC].

SC DHEC said in a news release 2 people have started post-exposure treatment after the baby raccoon tested positive for rabies.

DHEC said a victim picked up the juvenile raccoon on 29 Sep 2016 on the side of the road near the Beaufort Town Center. The victims were exposed while providing care for the animal, when the raccoon began acting abnormally, DHEC said.

The raccoon was submitted to DHEC's lab on 30 Sep 2016, and was confirmed to have rabies the following day.

There have been 11 animals in Beaufort County to test positive for rabies in 2016, with 79 confirmed cases of animal rabies statewide.

[3] Michigan - bat, human exposure

An 11-year-old Grand Junction [Michigan] boy and his brother are undergoing a series of preventative rabies shots after health officials confirmed that a bat that bit the older boy had rabies, a potentially deadly disease.

At 5 a.m. Monday [3 Oct 2016], Youth B felt something scratch his side as he slept, the child's mother said. When he [the child] reached down to brush it away, he was fully awakened by something biting his finger. He found a bat, still attached to his hand.

"Luckily he had the presence of mind to grab the animal," said the youth's mother. Unable to get out of his top bunk while clinging to the bat, he called to his brother, Youth J, 10, below to wake up and help him.

They hollered to their father, downstairs in the kitchen getting ready for work, and he awakened his wife.

Their mother said she knew that any bat bite required immediate medical attention, so they quickly woke up the younger children, 8 and 4 years old, and together the family went to South Haven Health System hospital's emergency room -- the bat, now dead, in tow.

"The nurses were scared of the bat," the mother said, but packed it for mailing into the lab to be tested. Youth B would need to have an immediate dose -- 2 shots in each arm -- of rabies immune globulin, they said, as a precaution to prevent the disease, which can be spread to humans through animal bites.

On Wednesday, when health officials confirmed the bat was, indeed, rabid, Youth J had to begin the same series of shots, in case he had been bitten in his sleep without noticing.

"The bite itself didn't look bad at all," the mother said, "and if the bat had not still been attached to his finger, my son might not know he had been bitten, they have such fine sharp teeth."

Nationwide, rabies commonly occurs in bats, skunks, fox, coyotes, raccoons, and a wide variety of other wildlife species, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Service [MDHHS].

Although human rabies cases are rare in the U.S., with an average of 2-3 cases documented each year, most of these cases in recent years have been caused by strains of rabies virus associated with bats, according to the health department. In the U.S., about 40 000 people each year receive treatment after rabies exposure, according to the MDHHS.

Animals that are submitted to the state health department for testing are those that have exposed a human being, a pet, or livestock, said MDHHS spokesperson Jennifer Eisner.

"The number of human cases of rabies has declined dramatically over the years thanks to development of improved human vaccines and the efforts to vaccinate pets and livestock against rabies," Eisner said. "In Michigan, the majority of rabies-positive animals are bats.

"If you find a bat in your home, especially it it's in a sleeping area, safely confine the animal and contact your local health department right away to find out if testing is recommended," she advised.

Erin Radke, public health nurse with the Allegan County Health Department, said fall is a common time for bats to get indoors as they seek warmth on cold nights.

Dr. Larry Wile, medical director for the Cass-VanBuren County Health Department, said repairing screens and patching any openings where bats may gain entrance is the 1st line of defense. If a bat does get inside, and bites someone, it's important to report the possible exposure and, if possible, to catch the animal for testing, he said.

The prophylactic shots are very effective at preventing spread of the disease, and neither boy is very worried about catching rabies, the mother said.

The family has had bats get into their rural home from time to time during the 6 years they have lived there, the mother said. Usually, if the family cats didn't quickly catch them, the bats could be shooed back out again, the mother said. "We don't want to kill them," she said.

But the children are carefully checking their beds and bedrooms each night, she said.

According to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, in 2016, as of 10 Oct 2016, 33 bats and 4 skunks have tested positive for rabies in Michigan.

A Bethlehem [Pennsylvania] teen is undergoing treatment for rabies after she picked up a sick bat and was bitten.

The 14-year-old girl was in Monocacy Park on 10 Oct 2016 when she tried to assist what she believed to be an injured bird, according to a story on LehighValleyLive.

Family members placed the bat into a box and rushed the girl to an area hospital, where she was immediately given the 1st dose in a series of vaccines to prevent her from contracting the rabies virus. The bat later tested positive for rabies, according to the story.

A raccoon that attacked a toddler before being killed by the child's father has tested positive for rabies, police said.

The 19-month-old was playing in a yard on Axe Factory Road [Mansfield, New Jersey] Wednesday [19 Oct 2016] when the raccoon attacked without provocation, police said in a statement.

The child's father fended off the raccoon with a pocket knife, killing it. The toddler was taken to the hospital for treatment and is recuperating at home.

Lab testing confirmed Friday [21 Oct 2016] the raccoon was rabid.

Police in Mansfield and neighboring towns are asking residents to report any wild animals that exhibit aggressive or unusual behavior.

Anyone who believes they had contact with a rabid animal should seek out medical testing and treatment.

[It seems this father could have been exposed to saliva as well. Let us hope the authorities got a good description of this fight with the raccoon and accessed the dad as well.

These articles do not mention keeping your pets (dogs, cats, horses, cows, etc.) vaccinated against rabies. These bats or raccoons could just as easily have bitten a curious horse or show calf or an aged pet. These animals are then capable of exposing their human caregivers. So protect yourself and your pets by vaccinating against rabies.

Raising awareness in a community where such an event has occurred is important. The city/town/etc. in conjunction with veterinarians should be having rabies drive for pets and educating the public about this almost universally fatal disease. - Mod.TG
