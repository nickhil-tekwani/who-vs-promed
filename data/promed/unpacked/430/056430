A pig virus that has run rampant in Iowa and Nebraska has been found on 25 South Dakota farms.

A virus that state health officials say kills one in 10 piglets has been detected in 25 farms in South Dakota.

State veterinarian Dusty Oedekoven says the farms have been officially certified with the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome.

The virus does not affect humans. KELO-AM (http://bit.ly/1iX8ZhM) reports the virus has run rampant in Iowa and Nebraska. There is no vaccine to prevent the virus from spreading.

Oedekoven says the strain was 1st detected in the US in April [2013]. He says bio-control standards are being put in place to keep the virus from spreading to other farms.

The official says the cost of pork is likely to go up because of the virus's high mortality rate.

[Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, commonly known as PRRS, has been found in many areas of North America.

This disease emerged in North America and Europe, roughly simultaneously, in the late 1980s. It was 1st called by the wonderfully descriptive title of "mystery swine disease." It is also commonly found in Asia. Its spread to Africa really does complete the picture of a pandemic that has relentlessly but not very rapidly spread across a wide swath of the world.

The disease is characterized by late-term abortions, stillbirths, piglets born weak, and respiratory signs in pigs of all ages. Production losses from the disease are severe. It is a very damaging disease economically, as the fruit of much of the investment on a swine farm is lost through abortion and infertility.

The most important question epidemiologically is how the disease spread to South Dakota, as new herds are often infected when swine showing no clinical signs are brought into the herd.

The above historical data on this disease was submitted by Mod.PC.

Also, requirements for PRRS vaccines can be seen in chapter 2.6.5 of OIE's (World Animal Health Organization) Manual for Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals, available at http://web.oie.int/fr/normes/mmanual/A_00099.htm, a reference kindly submitted by Mod.AS.
