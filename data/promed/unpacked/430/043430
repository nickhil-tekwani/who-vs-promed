People are fleeing certain African and Middle Eastern countries in large numbers and many are headed to the countries of Europe. In fact, one report notes that about 5000 people flee Eritrea each month, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN refugee agency. Among the things that can come from refugees and asylum seekers are infectious diseases contracted in their home country. Europe is currently reporting cases of cutaneous diphtheria in asylum seekers to several countries including Denmark, Sweden and Germany. To date, 9 cases have been reported by the 3 nations.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) say Denmark reported a case of toxigenic cutaneous diphtheria in an asylum-seeker from Eritrea in July 2015. He presented to health services with a traumatic leg wound received in Libya 2 months earlier.

At the same time, Sweden reported 2 confirmed cases of cutaneous diphtheria caused by toxigenic _C. diphtheriae_ in asylum seekers from Eritrea.

As of 27 Jul 2015, Germany has reported 4 cases of cutaneous diphtheria associated with asylum seekers in 2015. All infections were caused by toxigenic _C. diphtheriae_. One was in a refugee from Libya, one in a refugee from Ethiopia, one in a refugee from Eritrea, and one in a patient from Syria (refugee status unknown).

In addition, 2 cutaneous cases caused by _C. diphtheriae_ and associated with asylum seekers or foreign visitors were reported to the European Surveillance System in 2014. The 1st case was a refugee from Somalia and the 2nd case was a child from Angola who had come to Germany for medical care.

The information is limited about the vaccination status of these 9 cases.

The ECDC says there is no indication that these cases represent a significant outbreak of diphtheria among refugees in Europe. However, health systems might not be able to detect cutaneous diphtheria outbreaks among refugees because they have limited access to health services.

Cutaneous diphtheria is endemic in tropical countries but is uncommon in Europe. Vaccination is the only effective protection against toxigenic diphtheria, and unvaccinated people are at risk of developing potentially life-threatening infection with toxigenic _C. diphtheriae_.

Most refugees who arrive in Europe are from endemic countries and have travelled under conditions that increase the risk of acquiring cutaneous diphtheria, and many of them continue to be exposed to over-crowding and poor hygiene once they have arrived in the EU. This may increase the risk of diphtheria.

Diphtheria is a very rare disease in most European countries today. In 2009, 15 confirmed diphtheria cases were reported in 5 European countries, 47 were reported in 2008 and 21 in 2007 [4]. Occasional cases may therefore be undiagnosed and easily missed [1,2,5,6]. Correct treatment is therefore often delayed, as in the above cases. Unpublished data confirm previous findings that indicate that a large proportion of Swedish citizens born before the general introduction of diphtheria vaccination have inadequate immunity against diphtheria and tetanus [7]. These age groups are often active travelers to endemic regions for diphtheria. In the absence of effective vaccine registration, both patients and doctors hesitate as to whether or not give primary vaccination when the patient seeks vaccination advice before travel. Our index patient is an experienced global traveler and visited several travel medicine clinics during recent years. Both the physicians in the travel medicine clinic and the patient presumed that she was properly vaccinated against diphtheria and no further investigations were made. There was no documentation of her earlier immunization status. She was therefore given a booster dose. People travelling outside Europe and North America should always upgrade their diphtheria vaccination if not given within the last 20 years according to recommendations from the National Health Board in Sweden [7]. Tetanus vaccination is of course required even within Europe. Although vaccination does not guarantee immunity from contracting diphtheria, the protective effect against severe disease has been proved [1,2].

Cutaneous diphtheria is less well recognized than respiratory infection. Signs and symptoms of the soft tissue infection due to _C. diphtheria_ may be mild and unspecific and may occur even in fully vaccinated patients [1,2]. Microbiological laboratories often do not look for _C. diphtheria_ routinely in throat swab or wound specimens. Furthermore, a co-infection due to _Staphylococcus aureus_ or _S. pyogenes_ is sometimes reported and may mask or delay the diagnosis of cutaneous diphtheria. Cutaneous diphtheria may cause secondary respiratory and cutaneous infections and may even be a source of outbreaks [1].
