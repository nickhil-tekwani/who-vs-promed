According to the latest report of the Regional Health Office (DIRESA), to date 74 confirmed new Oropouche fever cases have been registered in the Ayacucho districts.

Oropouche fever is a little-known disease in the country, and investigation continues of which mosquito [sic, _Culicoides_ gnat] is responsible for transmission of the disease [virus] that is affecting the people in the Ayacucho forest.

According to DIRESA director Hugo Huamán Brizuela, the symptoms of Oropouche fever are similar to those of dengue fever, but unlike dengue, it is not fatal.

[Over the past decade, ProMED-mail has reported a few sporadic outbreaks of Oropouche fever in Peru. However, in addition to Peru, outbreaks of the Oropouche fever virus have been described in rural and urban communities of Brazil, Ecuador, Panama, and Trinidad and Tobago. As the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has noted, "the Oropouche virus exists in nature in 2 cycles, the wild and urban-epidemic cycles. In the wild cycle, wildlife such as primates, sloths, and certain arthropods serve as reservoirs, with the [_Culicoides_] flies acting as vectors. In the urban epidemic cycle, the infection cycle remains vector-human-vector, with humans acting as the principal hosts. Oropouche virus is a bunyavirus of the Simbu group.

"The disease produces symptoms similar to dengue. It has an incubation period of 4-8 days, with a range of between 3-12 days. The onset of symptoms is sudden, usually with a fever, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, chills, sometimes nausea, and persistent vomiting up to 5-7 days. Meningoencephalitis has been known to occur occasionally. Symptoms last from 5-7 days; however, full recovery can take up to several weeks in some patients" (see PAHO Epidemiological Alert at http://new.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3084&Itemid=2206). Fortunately, Oropouche fever is not fatal.
