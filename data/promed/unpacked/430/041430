According to information from the Ministry of Health and the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety [AGES], as of [Tue 10 Mar 2015], 20 farms nationwide are IBR-IPV [infectious bovine rhinotracheitis/infectious pustular vulvovaginitis] infected. The foci of the disease were 14 farms in Tyrol. From this state, the chain of infection has run its course since the end of January 2015. The pathogen had probably been introduced already in December 2014. Other affected holdings are located in Lower Austria (4) as well as in Vorarlberg and Upper Austria (one each).

The spread of the disease has been effectively controlled by the standstill and other preventive measures taken by the Ministry of Health and State Veterinary Authorities.

Since 1 Mar 2015, cattle (regardless of age) may enter livestock markets, agricultural animal auctions, and cattle shows only if they were previously shown to have tested negative for IBR/IPV or come from a holding that tested negative. [Further detailed requirements for cleaning and disinfection of transport vehicles, etc., are included].

Austria has been officially recognized free from IBR/IPV since 1999. This freedom is an essential contribution to good animal health status of the domestic cattle population. In order to maintain these additional guarantees, an annual monitoring program has been operational by the local veterinary authorities. On 17 Mar 2015, the Standing Committee in Brussels will discuss the situation with respect to Austria, Switzerland, and Germany on the basis of detailed reports [see commentary].

[Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis/infectious pustular vulvovaginitis (IBR/IPV), caused by bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), is a disease of domestic and wild cattle. It is not zoonotic. The disease is included in OIE's list of diseases that are of socio-economic and/or public health importance, and that are significant in international trade. According to OIE's Manual (last updated 2010), the virus is distributed worldwide, but has been eradicated from Austria, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Italy (Province of Bolzano), Switzerland, Norway, and parts of Germany (the 'Oberfranken' and 'Oberpfalz' districts of Bavaria). Control programmes are running in several other countries, for example in Germany and Italy.

IBR/IPV recent recurrence in Austria has caused concern. The Austrian authorities have submitted a presentation to the EU Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH), discussed during its recent meeting in Brussels, 5-6 Mar 2015 (thanks to Sabine Zentis for bringing this presentation to our attention). The presentation includes details on the investigations applied and the tracing back of IBR/IPV introduction, most probably mid December 2014. Data have been collected by means of the VIS-Database system (Austria's Consumers health Information System electronic database) and TRACES ("TRAde Control and Expert System", a trans-European network for veterinary health which notifies, certifies and monitors imports, exports and trade in animals and animal products). The infection was traced back to a company in Soell, Tyrol, district Kufstein, and in particular to an imported consignment of slaughter animals from a Member State. Subscribers are referred to the presentation, in particular slide 8 with a map showing the distribution of the 20 infected holdings, throughout Austria, and slide 11, with a map showing 365 holdings with contact animals and their status (negatives and positives). The presentation is available at http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/docs/20150205_ibr_austria_en.pdf.

Austria's bovine population (2014) is 1 953 201; the number of holdings (2014) is 65 209.

Details on IBR/IPV are available in OIE's Manual (Chapter 2.4.13; version adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2010), at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.13_IBR_IPV.pdf.

The disease is characterised by clinical signs of the upper respiratory tract, such as a (muco)purulent nasal discharge, hyperaemia of the muzzle (red nose disease), and by conjunctivitis. Signs of general illness are fever, depression, inappetence, abortions and reduced milk yield. The virus can also infect the genital tract and cause pustular vulvovaginitis and balanoposthitis [inflammation of the glans penis and the foreskin]. Post-mortem examinations reveal rhinitis, laryngitis, and tracheitis. Mortality is low, and most infections run a subclinical course. Secondary bacterial infections can lead to more severe respiratory disease, and BoHV-1 could play a role in multifactor diseases such as 'shipping fever.' - Mod.AS
