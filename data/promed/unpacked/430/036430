Hundreds of people in northwestern China have been hospitalized with
lead poisoning that was likely caused by pollution from a nearby
smelter, state media and local officials said Wednesday.
The poisonings in 2 villages in poverty-stricken Gansu province added
to a string of recent pollution disasters in China that have prompted
violent protests in some areas.
The first sign of trouble in the villages of Xinsi and Moba came on
18 Aug 2006, when medical tests showed 10 people had high levels of
lead in their blood, the Beijing Daily Messenger reported.
Health officials conducted checkups and "discovered that almost every
family in the villages had the same kind of problem," or at least 879
residents, the newspaper said. The youngest victim was 5 months old.
"Children started feeling ill and their parents brought them to a
local hospital," an official from Hui county, where the 2 villages
are located, said by phone. "We suspect that they were sickened by
pollution caused by a lead smelter nearby that discharged waste into
the air."
The smelter was shut down and an investigation was under way, the
official said. He refused to give his name or the name of the
smelting company.
The smelter was to be moved to another location soon and the local
government was paying for hospital bills for the villagers, the
official said. They were being treated at a hospital in neighboring
Shaanxi province because it had better facilities.
Telephones at the Xijing Hospital in Shaanxi's capital, Xi'an, were
not answered Wednesday.
News photos showed groups of people lining up at the hospital for
check-ups, while one boy cried as a blood sample was taken from him.
Excessive amounts of lead can damage the nervous and reproductive
systems and cause high blood pressure and anemia. The metal
accumulates in bones, and is especially harmful to pregnant women and
young children.
Lead poisoning can be diagnosed from a blue line around the gums and
in severe cases can cause convulsions, coma and death.
Environmental protection has become a prominent issue in China
following a number of industrial accidents in the past year in which
major rivers have been poisoned, forcing several cities to shut down
their water systems.
Chinese cities are among the world's smoggiest following 2 decades of
breakneck economic growth. The government says all of China's major
rivers are dangerously polluted. Millions of people lack access to
clean drinking water.
Lawmakers have said they are considering raising fines for
environmental violators in order to encourage companies to spend more
on clean technology.
But health problems stemming from pollution are still common, and
villagers in rural China are becoming increasingly frustrated. In
2005, farmers in the eastern province of Zhejiang clashed with police
during an anti-pollution protest at a battery factory.
They said the factory discharged wastewater about 650 yards away from
9 nearby villages, causing high levels of lead in their children's
blood.
At least 700 children were found to have been poisoned, state media said.

According to local officials, 354 people, including 146 children, in
northwest China's Gansu Province have been confirmed to be suffering
from lead poisoning. The victims are from the villages of Xinsi and
Muba.
The stricken children were hospitalized and their treatment is being
paid for by the local government. None of them are in serious
condition, said the local official.
Hu Hongtao, head of the county government's publicity department,
said rumors that more than 1000 were hospitalized were untrue.
The 1st patient was a 5-year-old boy who was discovered to be
suffering from lead poisoning in a hospital in Xi'an when he was
being treated for a different medical emergency. His symptoms
included no appetite, stomach pain and weight loss.
Other children with similar symptoms were then sent for check-ups and
more cases of lead poisoning were discovered.
Villagers suspect they were sickened by discharge from a nearby lead
smelting plant which released water and air pollution. The smelter
has been ordered to suspend production and investigators are testing
the water and soil.
Excessive amounts of lead in the body harms the nervous and
reproductive systems and causes high blood pressure and anemia.

The South China Morning Post said on Wednesday that 2000 Chinese
villagers are being treated in hospital for lead poisoning which they
say was caused by a local smelting plant.
The villagers, including 300 children, had traveled from their
northwestern province of Gansu to a hospital in Xi'an in neighboring
Shaanxi because hospitals near their 3 villages had insisted they
were fine, the newspaper said, quoting the local Huashang Daily.
"We don't trust local hospitals because they said our lead
concentration levels were normal, so we traveled to somewhere further
away," Liu Jiangtao, from surrounding Hui county, was quoted as
saying. "Everyone from our village has gone there."
County government officials told Reuters only 2 villages were close
to the lead smelter and the county was still investigating how many
people had been poisoned. Another county official said only 2
villagers had been found to be sick and the smelter was shut down
last month.
Doctors at the Xi Jing Hospital in Xi'an, where the villagers were
treated, declined to comment.
Authorities closed a factory and detained a manager and 7 others
following a chemical spill in the northeastern province of Jilin
during August 2006.

[Lead is a metal with no known biological benefit to humans. Too much
lead can damage various systems of the body including the nervous and
reproductive systems and the kidneys, and it can cause high blood
pressure and anemia. Lead accumulates in the bones, and lead
poisoning may be diagnosed from a blue line around the gums. Lead is
especially harmful to the developing brains of fetuses and young
children and to pregnant women. Lead interferes with the metabolism
of calcium and Vitamin D. High blood lead levels in children can
cause consequences which may be irreversible including learning
disabilities, behavioral problems, and mental retardation. At very
high levels, lead can cause convulsions, coma and death.
People are exposed to lead through the air they breathe, through
water and through food/ingestion. Toxic effects are usually due to
long-term exposure. The population groups at greatest risk of
exposure are young children and workers. A recent report suggests
that even a blood level of 10 micrograms per decilitre can have
harmful effects on children's learning and behavior (CDC, 2000).
People can be exposed to lead contamination from the motor vehicle
exhaust of leaded gasoline, as well as from industrial sources such
as smelters and lead manufacturing and recycling industries, from
cottage industry uses and waste sites (e.g. contaminated landfills).
The effects of lead are the same whether it enters the body through
breathing or swallowing. Lead can affect almost every organ and
system in your body. The main target for lead toxicity is the nervous
system, both in adults and children. Long-term exposure of adults can
result in decreased performance in some tests that measure functions
of the nervous system. It may also cause weakness in fingers, wrists,
or ankles. Lead exposure also causes small increases in blood
pressure, particularly in middle-aged and older people and can cause
anemia. Exposure to high lead levels can severely damage the brain
and kidneys in adults or children and ultimately cause death. In
pregnant women, high levels of exposure to lead may cause
miscarriage. High-level exposure in men can damage the organs
responsible for sperm production.
A blood test is available to measure the amount of lead in your blood
and to estimate the amount of your recent exposure to lead. Blood
tests are commonly used to screen children for lead poisoning. Lead
in teeth or bones can be measured by X-ray techniques, but these
methods are not widely available. Exposure to lead also can be
evaluated by measuring erythrocyte protoporphyrin (EP) in blood
samples. EP is a part of red blood cells known to increase when the
amount of lead in the blood is high. However, the EP level is not
sensitive enough to identify children with elevated blood lead levels
below about 25 micrograms per deciliter (microg/dL). These tests
usually require special analytical equipment that is not available in
a doctor's office. However, your doctor can draw blood samples and
send them to appropriate laboratories for analysis.
