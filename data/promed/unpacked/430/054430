WHEAT STEM RUST, STRAIN UG99 - AUSTRALIA ex ETHIOPIA (02): CLARIFICATION
************************************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

ProMED-mail is a program of the

From: Jonathan Taylor <Jonathan.Taylor@daff.gov.au>


In regards to the interception of wheat stem rust on a consignment of
wheat from Ethiopia, posted [by ProMED-mail on 3 Dec 2008].

The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service [AQIS] inspected the
consignment as part of routine protocols and detected the presence of
fungal spores in the wheat at quarantine inspection facilities. The
fungus was identified as _Puccinia graminis_ var _tritici_ only and
any further identification of a specific race would be speculative.
As per protocol, and working with the importer, the consignment was
destroyed and did not move beyond quarantine.

[Ug99 is the most destructive strain of wheat stem rust (caused by
the fungus _Puccinia graminis_ f. sp. _tritici_). Given the
seriousness of a potential Ug99 incursion for any country, we are
happy to disseminate this statement of clarification by AQIS. For
more information please see the original ProMED-mail post no.
