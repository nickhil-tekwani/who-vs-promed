Ginger farms in Kerala and Karnataka [were] submerged in floods starting June [2018]. Ginger rhizomes have since been affected by the soft rot disease. Heavy rains in ginger growing districts flooded the fields. They wiped out rhizomes on almost 5000 hectares [about 12 360 acres] in Karnataka and 2500 hectares [about 6180 acres] in Kerala, [the] South Indian Ginger Growers' Association [said].

"Torrential rains have washed off black pepper vines in many parts of the 2 states," [the] Indian Pepper and Spice Traders, Farmers, Producers and Planters Consortium said. "High moisture has triggered diseases like quick wilt and soft wilt." Pepper production may fall 40-50 per cent.

The Coffee Board has launched a comprehensive calamity survey to assess the loss in the sector, including crop loss, damage to plants, green berry dropping and black rot disease, due to the flood [the] Coffee Board (Extension) said. Coffee industry sources said 'Arabica' coffee production is likely to fall about 30 per cent and the Robusta variety by about 20 per cent in the country in 2018-19.

[Ginger
------
In India, fungal soft rot due to _Pythium_ species is considered the most serious disease of ginger (_Zingiber officinale_). It has been reported to destroy up to 90 per cent of the annual crop. Symptoms include rotting of shoot bases, yellowing and drying up of leaves, collapse of shoots and rotting of rhizomes. The disease is favoured by high moisture in the soil. The pathogens are spread with infected materials including soil and plant debris, by mechanical means and water. Disease management includes the use of well-drained planting sites, crop rotation and preventative fungicide treatments of rhizomes for planting. All of the commercial ginger germplasm available today is highly susceptible, but the related ornamental _Z. zerumbet_ was identified as a potential source of genetic resistance.

Rhizome rots caused by other fungi, such as _Fusarium_ species, as well as bacteria in the genera _Ralstonia_ and _Erwinia_ have also been reported from various locations but are considered of minor importance in the region.

Pepper
------
Quick wilt (also called foot rot) of black pepper (_Piper nigrum_) is caused by the fungus-like organism _Phytophthora capsici_. It is considered one of the most serious threats to this crop and a yield decline of 75 per cent has been reported in some instances. It affects leaves and vines, but once roots are affected the plant wilts and dies within a month. The pathogen is spread by splashing rain and mechanical means. It has a very wide host range and therefore large pathogen reservoirs which make it difficult to control. Disease management includes fungicides, biocontrol, use of disease free and resistant cultivars and cultural practices.

Slow wilt (also called slow decline, yellows) is caused by nematodes. Symptoms include leaf yellowing and shedding, root degeneration, blackening of branches and eventual death of the vine. Disease management of nematodes is difficult and includes nematicides, use of resistant host varieties and crop rotation with non-host species.

Coffee
------
The fungus _Corticium koleroga_ causes thread blight (also called black rot) of coffee and some other tropical or subtropical woody plants, including citrus species. Symptoms include dark brown or black decay and rot of leaves, twigs, and berries, followed by defoliation, berry drop, and dieback. Affected leaves may hang from strong fungal mycelial threads that can be seen on twigs and petioles. Whole plantings can be affected resulting in severe crop damage. Disease development is favoured by heavy rainfall, high humidity, shade, and overhanging branches. Spread occurs by wind, water, plant, and other material, as well as mechanical means (including insect activities). Disease management is difficult and may include cultural practices, phytosanitation to reduce available inoculum and copper sprays whenever weather conditions permit.

Premature drop of 10 to 50 per cent of green berries has been attributed to a number of causes, including nutritional disorders and waterlogging.

Two coffee species are grown commercially: _Coffea arabica_ (arabica or highland coffee) which is usually preferred for its taste; and _C. canephora_ (robusta or lowland coffee).
