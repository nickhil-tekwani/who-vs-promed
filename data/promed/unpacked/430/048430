A 4th case of chronic wasting disease [CWD] has been confirmed in deer in South Texas.

The San Antonio Express-News (http://bit.ly/1LbR0Pm) reported [Fri 14 Aug 2015] that the latest infected deer was raised in Medina County at the same ranch as the other 3 animals. That's prompted an increase in testing of both captive-bred and hunter-harvested deer.

New rules that take effect [24 Aug 2015] to establish conditions that must be met before breeders, most of whom have been banned from shipping deer since July [2015], can sell or transport deer in advance of hunting season. The season starts in October.

CWD affects the brains and nervous systems of animals and isn't considered a threat to human health.

Texas is limiting release of captive-raised deer to properties enclosed by high fencing to protect against spreading the disease.

[It seems a bit worrying that there is not more epidemiological information with regard to this incident. Has the food been examined? Was there a breech in some food that included mammalian tissue?

Or is there a mechanism of transmission that has not been discussed/documented/discovered?

Many people do not believe that prions may pass in urine, but if that is the case (for the sake of this discussion it will be considered possible), did an infected deer pee through the fence and thus provide a nidus of infection?

We anxiously a wait more information on this situation in Medina County, Texas. - Mod.TG
