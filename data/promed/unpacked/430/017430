Laboratory testing has confirmed a Launceston bakery was the
source of Tasmania's worst salmonella outbreak. 64 people
have been infected with the bacteria over the past few
weeks. The Trevallyn Bakery and the associated Sugar Shack
bakery voluntarily closed last week after the outbreak was
linked to their products.
Of the 64 people infected, 6 were taken to the hospital, but
all have since been released.
The Public and Environmental Health Service says tests have
identified salmonella in piping bags, used to dispense cream
and icing, at the Trevallyn Bakery.
The director of Public Health, Roscoe Taylor, says it is
highly likely a lack of hygienic controls at the bakery
allowed other food to become infected.
Dr Taylor says the bakeries will be allowed to reopen once
the staff have received training in food safety and tests
have confirmed the cleanliness of the premises and safety of
food products.
