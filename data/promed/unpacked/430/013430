AHSV serotype 2 in Nigeria
-------------------------------
African horse sickness serotype 2 has been detected for the 1st time in the
Northern hemisphere.
One of the blood samples sent to our reference center from Nigeria was used
for the extraction of viral dsRNA. Segment 2 (S2) was partially sequenced,
and comparison with S2 sequence of the 9 AHSV serotypes showed that the
Nigerian isolate is of AHSV genotype 2. Virus neutralization using serum
from the same horses confirmed that they contain AHSV seroype 2 specific
neutralizing antibodies.
S2 sequence comparisons with that of the AHSV2 reference strain and South
African AHSV2 isolates from the 2006 season revealed that the Nigerian
isolate S2 sequence was identical to some of the AHSV2 isolates made in
South Africa.
Also of interest is the fact that AHSV2 was isolated from cases in
Botswana. The genomes of these isolates will be sequenced shortly for
comparison to the Nigerian isolate.
The virus has also been isolated on cell culture and will be characterized
further.

[The cases in Nigerian horses, now identified as African horse sickness
(AHS), were initially suspected to be caused by Equine herpesvirus (see
references). The possible involvement of this virus has still to be excluded.
AHS results from infection with the African horse sickness virus (AHSV), a
member of the genus _Orbivirus_ in the family _Reoviridae_. AHS is endemic
in sub-Saharan central and east Africa, sometimes spreading to southern
Africa and occasionally to northern Africa. AHS epizootics became less
common in southern Africa during the latter half of the 20th century,
possibly due to decreases in free-ranging zebra populations.
There are 9 serotypes of AHSV. Serotype 9 is widespread in endemic regions,
while serotypes 1 to 8 are found only in limited geographic areas.
Background information on AHS is available in Mod.TG's commentary in the
Mpumalanga outbreak posting referenced below and at
<http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/african_horse_sickness.pdf>.
Nigeria has reported the absence of AHS in annual reports, available on
OIE's website, since 1997. The earlier presence of the virus in Nigeria was
reported in the following paper:
Adeyefa CA & Hamblin C (1995). Continuing prevalence of African horse
sickness in Nigeria. Rev Elev Med Vet Pays Trop. 95;48(1):31-3.
The abstract of the said paper says:
"Equine sera collected from 10 widely separated regions throughout Nigeria
were tested for antibodies against African horse sickness viruses (AHSV)
using [ELISA]. The animals sampled included imported, exotic horses,
indigenous and locally cross-bred (local) horses and African donkeys. A
high percentage of the sera (79.8 percent) were positive, confirming the
continued prevalence of AHSV antibodies in Nigerian horses and donkeys."
A map of Africa is available at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/africa_pol_2003.jpg>.
An outbreak of AHS serotype 2 was reported from South Africa in 2003. It
occurred in the Drakensberg mountains at an altitude above 1500 meters.
Entomological data indicated that _Culicoides bolitinos_, a cattle dung
breeder, was involved, not the more usual _C.imicola_. - Mod.AS]
