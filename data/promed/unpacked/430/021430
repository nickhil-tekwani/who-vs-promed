*****[My comment is wrong. It refers to the Venezuelan equine encephalitis vaccine. There is no human vaccine for EEE -- which is a bit surprising since it is a select agent (determined to have the potential to pose a severe threat to both human and animal health). I regret the error. - Mod.JW]

The Ministry of Agricultural Development (MIDA) in Darien province confirmed 2 cases of [eastern] equine encephalitis [EEE] in horses.

Bredio Velasco, Chief of Animal Health, on RPC Radio after a tour, confirmed that both are young animals, a year and 5 months old.

Velasco assured that this new outbreak is being controlled, unlike the equine encephalitis outbreak that killed 150 animals in 2010.

Since there is practically no possibility of recuperation of an animal with encephalits, Velasco stressed the importance of vaccination of horses and moreover requested that citizens avoid creating breeding sites for mosquitoes that could transmit the virus to humans.

[This is official confirmation of the 2 equine EEE cases that ProMED-mail posted based on a report from an unofficial source (archive no. 20150823.3596420).

As noted in the previous post, there have been occasional cases of EEE in equines and humans in Darien province of Panama in the recent past. There were laboratory-confirmed equine cases in 2011 and again in 2013. In 2010, there were also 25 suspected human EEE cases, although ProMED never received information that these cases were laboratory confirmed. Although relatively rare, clinical cases of encephalitis from EEE virus infections in humans and equine animals can be very serious, with a high case fatality rate and severe neurological sequelae in survivors. There is a commercially available vaccine for equine animals. The advice of the Chief of Animal Health offered above is prudent -- equine animals should be vaccinated against EEE virus infections and mosquito breeding sites should be eliminated.

[There is currently a vaccine available for both humans and horses. The live attenuated vaccine known as TC-83 is a strain of VEEV that was passed 83 times in guinea pig heart cells. There is also an inactivated form of the vaccine known as C-84 derived from the TC-83 strain. Currently only the C-84 vaccine is licensed for use in horses in the U.S. although countries such as Mexico and Colombia still produce the live vaccine for horses.

In the U.S., only at risk military and laboratory personnel are vaccinated with the TC-83 strain and some receive C-84 boosters if initial vaccination did not produce sufficient immunity. The vaccine does have side effects that ranged from mild to moderate and did not provide full protection of nonhuman primates challenged by aerosol exposure, the route of transmission most likely if VEEV were to be used in a biological terrorist attack (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_equine_encephalitis_virus#Vaccine). - Mod.JW
