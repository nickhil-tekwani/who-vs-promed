Botulism outbreak killing ducks
-------------------------------
Dozens of dead ducks have been found in Waitakere's waterways in the past 2
weeks because of an outbreak of the paralyzing botulism toxin. [A local
resident] whose property backs on to a stream running from the Glendale
pond has found 26 dead ducks near his home in the past 6 days. "It's awful
to see these poor birds suffer like this. I put a piece of wet bread not
even 10cm away from the mouth of one but she couldn't even move to eat it."

Botulism causes ducks to lose control of their head and necks before the
paralysis spreads to the rest of their bodies. [This loss of control is
some times called, "limberneck disease." - Mod.TG]

Auckland Council stormwater manager Grant Ockleston says warm water is a
breeding ground for bacteria. "It's been hot in Auckland in the past few
weeks which has heated up water temperatures and reduced water flow, a
perfect breeding ground for the botulism-causing bacteria."

The council put barley straw into the water to neutralise the botulism
bacteria in September [2010].

Lyn Macdonald runs the Bird Rescue Trust in Green Bay and says she has
received ducks with botulism signs from streams and ponds in Glen Eden and
Henderson's Riverpark. She's also cared for more than 30 sick birds found
at Western Springs. "People need to stop polluting the waterways by
throwing away their grass clippings, dead branches and rubbish because it
blocks the flow of the water which creates these conditions," she says.

Auckland Regional Public Health Service medical officer of health Simon
Baker says avian botulism is a very low risk to humans but people should
clean their hands well after being in contact with sick and dead birds.
Anyone who finds dead ducks should contact the Auckland Council to have
them removed. Sick ducks can be taken to the Bird Rescue Trust.

[How fascinating! Part of this article says they but barley straw into the
water way to neutralize the toxin. The second part of the article says
people should not put their grass clippings and the like into the waterway.
I have never come across any mention of barley straw neutralizing the
preformed toxin. So it might appear that the council and bird rescuers may
not be on the quite the same page.

The sporulating anaerobic Gram positive bacillus _Clostridium botulinum_
elaborates 7 types of antigenically distinct neurotoxins, 4 of which affect
humans: type A, B, E, or rarely type F toxin. Types A and B toxins are
highly poisonous proteins resistant to digestion by GI (gastrointestinal)
enzymes. About half of the foodborne outbreaks in the United States are
caused by type A toxin, followed by types B and E.

Type C botulism occurs principally in waterfowl and other birds living in
an aquatic environment and causes tremendous losses, most notably in
waterfowl in the western US. In addition to North America, it has been
reported in birds in Europe, South Africa, Uruguay, and Australia. In the
Great Lakes region, it was 1st identified in 1936 in ducks on Green Bay of
Lake Michigan and in 1941 in Monroe County marshes along Lake Erie. Type C
is most often associated with limberneck paralysis in birds.

Type E botulism is connected with consumption of fish and occurs mainly in
gulls and loons, and to a lesser extent in mergansers, mute swans, grebes,
and shorebirds. It now appears any birds or mammals susceptible to
botulinum toxin run a risk of becoming poisoned if they scavenge dead fish.
Evidence for this includes the identification of type E toxin in a bald
eagle, wood ducks, and muskrats with fish remaining in their digestive tracts.

Typically a bird dies of some cause, and the carcass is an incubator for
the anaerobes. The maggots move into the decomposing carcass, accumulating
the toxin. Other birds come to eat the maggots on the carcass and infect
themselves, dying from the very disease they consumed, and so the circle
gets larger and requires that carcasses to be picked up, or the cycle
continues. - Mod.TG
