An official with the state Game Commission updated the Greene County
commissioners Thursday [4 Oct 2007] about a viral disease that has
caused the deaths of as many as 1500 deer in Greene and Washington counties.
During the commissioners' regular meeting Thursday [4 Oct 2007],
Harry Gillespie, deputy wildlife conservation officer with the Game
Commission, provided information regarding the recent outbreak of
epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) that has infected and killed a
large number of deer in Greene County and throughout the state.
Gillespie explained that EHD is the most common infectious disease of
white-tailed deer in the eastern United States and is contracted by
the bite of insects called "biting midges." EHD is caused by a virus
that is spread by midges that live in or near water and wet and muddy
areas, and the insects transmit the virus as they feed.
Gillespie said at least 1500 deer deaths caused by EHD have been
reported in Greene and Washington counties. Many areas in the
northwestern parts of Greene -- particularly Richhill, Gray, Morris,
Aleppo and Center townships -- have been severely impacted by the
outbreak, he said.
Deer deaths caused by EHD also have been reported in West Finley,
East Finley, South Franklin and Morris townships in Washington
County, according to the Game Commission.
Numerous other states are finding EHD-related mortalities this year
[2006]. Gillespie said he recently learned that EHD-related cases had
been confirmed in 20 counties throughout West Virginia. Reports also
have been confirmed recently in Kentucky, Tennessee, Indiana and Virginia.
However, the number of EHD-related deer deaths reported in Greene
County has appeared to have "slowed down" as of late, Gillespie said,
adding that the EHD outbreak should end with the onset of colder
weather, which will kill the insects that spread the disease.
"A good, hard frost should kill the insects and end the outbreak,"
Gillespie said. "But as long as we have hot and dry weather, the
outbreak will continue to be a problem here."
Gillespie added that the Game Commission is confident the outbreak
will be eliminated in time for the start of deer rifle season, which
begins 26 Nov 2007.
Gillespie also shared information regarding signs of EHD that can
found in infected deer. According to information provided by
Gillespie, deer in the early stages of EHD may appear lethargic,
disoriented, lame or unresponsive to humans.
As the disease progresses, the deer may drool or may have bloody
discharge from the nose, sores on the mouth and swollen, blue
tongues. The deer also may become skinny because they stop eating.
In a press release recently issued by the Game Commission, Dr. Walter
Cottrell, Pennsylvania Game Commission wildlife veterinarian,
stressed that there is no evidence that humans can acquire the
disease by touching or field-dressing a deer.
However, as a routine precaution, all hunters are encouraged to wear
rubber or latex gloves when handling or field-dressing an animal and
wash hands and tools thoroughly after field dressing.
While EHD is not transmissible to humans, deer displaying severe
signs of EHD may not be suitable for consumption, Cottrell said.
Residents are encouraged to continue to report any unusual sightings
of infected deer to Matt Hough, the Game Commission's Southwest
Region director, by calling the regional office at 724-238-9523.
Game Commission officials agreed at a meeting held last month
[September 2007] in Harrisburg to take proactive steps to address the
recent EHD outbreak.
Last month [September 2007], Sen. Richard Kasunic called on the
commission to take action over the significant threat the outbreak
poses to the deer herd in southwestern Pennsylvania.
In a press release issued after the Harrisburg meeting, Kasunic said
he was confident the commission would take proactive steps to work
with local hunters and game officials to address the disease.
Kasunic said Carl Roe, the Game Commission's executive director and 4
commissioners agreed to take steps to combat the disease. The
commissioners agreed to hold informational meetings in areas that
could be impacted by EHD.
Kasunic said a meeting would be scheduled with sportsmen and wildlife
managers in the Greene and Washington wildlife management region to
discuss the disease, its potential impact on the local deer
population, preventative precautions and possible lasting solutions.
Gillespie said Game Commission officials held a meeting at the Greene
County Fairgrounds on 28 Sep 2007, which 550 concerned area residents
attended. The meeting included informational presentations by game
commission experts focusing on the EHD outbreak.
The last EHD outbreak confirmed in Greene and Washington counties was
reported in 2002, according to the Game Commission.

An insect-borne disease isn't done with the state's deer population
yet, even though the coming cold weather means its days are numbered.
The malady -- epizootic hemorrhagic disease, or EHD -- has so far
spread to at least 20 counties, wildlife officials said, and they
expect it will be etected in others as laboratory samples taken from
dead deer are studied.
Paul Johansen, assistant wildlife chief at the Division of Natural
Resources, can't remember seeing the disease quite so widespread,
either in West Virginia or regionally.
"It's been in Pennsylvania; Kentucky's had problems, Tennessee," he
said. The disease has also been confirmed in Ohio, Indiana and Virginia.
Although the disease has been found in West Virginia and other
mid-Atlantic states before, it's more common in warmer, Southern states.
The warm, dry summer may have contributed to the spread of the
ailment, Johansen said. The lack of water forces large numbers of
deer to congregate in the remaining areas that haven't dried up,
which is also where the biting midge, the insect that carries EHD, lives.
The disease is normally fatal to deer within 5-10 days. Cold weather
usually ends any outbreak by killing the insects that spread the virus.
Although the disease can't spread to humans, the state Department of
Agriculture is worried because it has made the jump to livestock.
Cattle on 3 farms in Mineral County, which borders Maryland, have
tested positive for the disease, said Gary Kinder, assistant state
veterinarian. The state has sent samples from farms in Jackson and
Roane counties and expect results in about a week.
Farmers in areas with infected deer should be especially vigilant in
checking livestock for symptoms of the disease, like listlessness and
a protruding tongue.
Davidson said 1993 was the last time EHD was detected in West Virginia cattle.
The 1st heavy frost should stop the problem in West Virginia, which
is why Johansen said there's no need to panic.
"This isn't a crisis. The sky's not falling. This is a pretty common
disease," he said.

With both states finding this disease, it is likely that neighboring
states such as Maryland have the disease. Surveillance is important
since the clinical signs of this disease are also on the rule out
list for such diseases as anthrax and foot and mouth disease,
especially when it spills over to cattle. - Mod.TG]
