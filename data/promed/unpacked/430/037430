FUNGAL DISEASES, POTATO - BANGLADESH

Vast areas of potato fields in Nilphamari are attacked with early
blight and late blight diseases due to dense fog and chilly cold.
With expectations of good prices from potato as in last year [2007],
farmers deployed all their resources to have a good yield, but the
prospects have dashed their hopes.
During visits to potato fields in Itakhola, Tupamari and Ramnagar
villages in Sadar upazila [sub-district]; Balagram and Golna in
Jaldhaka; Kalikapur, Nitai and Bahagli in Kishoreganj and Gayabari
and Khalisha-chapani in Dimla, potato plants in many fields were seen
dying with their stems rotten and leaves shrunk. Farmer Hasanul Islam
in Tupamari village in Sadar upazila said he sowed potato on 4 bighas
[0.54 ha] of land. Plants on one bigha [0.13 ha] are dying due to
attack by the diseases. Adjoining fields will also be attacked soon,
he said. Tayeb Ali of Monthena village in Kishoreganj said his 2
bighas [0.26 ha] of potato have already been attacked with stem rot
disease. The plants are dying rapidly. They said the diseases spread
rapidly from one field to another.
Farmers in most affected areas alleged that despite repeated appeals,
block supervisors seldom visit their affected potato fields to give
proper advice on how to protect the crop. When contacted, a block
supervisor seeking anonymity said he is under pressure from higher
authorities to oversee fertilizer distribution.
Deputy Director of District Agriculture office, Eunus Ali, said early
blight and late blight diseases may attack potato fields when the
temperature drops to 8 C and the weather remains damp for days due to
dense fog. However, he said he did not get any report of attack by
early blight or late blight diseases in potato fields. "If there is
any attack, it would be negligible."
Crop specialist of the Agriculture Extension Department (AED) in
Nilphamari, Osman Gani, said fungicide can be sprayed in fields as
a precaution against the diseases if damp weather continues for over
one week. AED sources said the target of potato cultivation in the
district was 16 000 hectares. But enthusiastic farmers who got high
prices last year [2007] exceeded the target. Potato has been sown on
a record 22 000 hectares this year [2008], they said.

[There are 2 major leaf blights of potato.
Early blight
------------
Early blight is caused by
the fungus _Alternaria solani_. Symptoms of dark spots usually
develop 1st on the older leaflets of mature plants, spreading to the
younger leaves under favorable weather conditions. Spots enlarge
causing early senescence of leaflets and yield reduction. The fungus
may also cause lesions on tubers. This pathogen can often be
recovered from healthy-looking leaf tissue prior to the onset of
tubers but causes no visible symptoms until potatoes approach
maturity. The disease occurs over a wider range of climatic
conditions than late blight (see below). The fungus is spread with
infected plant material (including tubers), by mechanical means, and
by wind and rain. Most rapid progress of the disease occurs during
periods of alternating wet and dry weather. Early blight is often
more severe when the potato crop has been under stress of poor
nutrition, injury, insect damage, drought, or other types of stress.
Cultivars with reduced susceptibility are available, and fungicides
are used for disease management.
Late blight
-----------
Late blight is caused by the fungus _Phytophthora infestans_, which
can also infect other solanaceous crops such as tomato or eggplant.
It is one of the most important potato diseases worldwide with
reported yield losses of up to 75 percent. It affects leaves as well
as tubers and is favoured by cool, moist conditions. The fungus is
spread by plant material (including seed tubers), wind and water, and
solanaceous weeds can serve as pathogen reservoirs. Other fungi and
bacteria often invade blight-infected tubers resulting in total tuber
breakdown. Late blight is a concern in many countries because new and
even more virulent strains continue to emerge. Some of these can
destroy a potato plant in a matter of hours and a complete crop
within days. Disease management includes preventative fungicide
treatments of seed tubers as well as fungicide sprays of crops.
Stem rot
--------
The 3rd disease mentioned above, stem rot (also called white mold),
is caused by the fungus _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_. This soil-borne
fungus is among the most nonspecific, omnivorous and successful of
plant pathogens and is present worldwide in a wide range of climates.
Almost 400 host species are known, including crops such as cabbage,
common bean, citrus, celery, coriander, melon, squash, soybean,
tomato, lettuce, and cucumber. Symptoms on potato include rapid
wilting and death of vines leading to yield losses of varying
severity. The fungus can survive in soil as hard black sclerotia and
is also spread by infected plant material. Disease management
includes cultural practices and fungicide applications.
Different perceptions of the seriousness of agricultural problems by
politicians and farmers appear to occur repeatedly in Bangladesh (see
previous ProMED post no. 20071030.3524 on rice diseases in this
country). There is no doubt that the farmers are facing serious
hardship, however, the national system to respond to crop disease
outbreaks appears to be lacking.
