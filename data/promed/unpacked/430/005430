A man in his 60s in Nagasaki Prefecture died in autumn 2005 after developing severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or SFTS, after being infected by a tick-borne virus, the health ministry said Tuesday [26 Feb 2013]. He is the 5th confirmed victim of the newly found tick-borne viral disease in the country.

The 4 other victims died last year [2012] after being infected with the SFTS virus. They were 3 men from Ehime, Miyazaki, and Hiroshima prefectures, and a woman from Yamaguchi Prefecture.

The latest confirmed case shows that SFTS existed in Japan before an outbreak in China in 2009, an official from the Health, Labor, and Welfare Ministry said.

For [another] 7 suspected cases, the National Institute of Infectious Diseases conducted blood tests but did not detect SFTS-specific virus nucleic acid. Blood tests are to be conducted on 5 more suspected cases.

[ProMED-mail thanks Catherine O'Connor for forwarding the Daily Yomiuri report and for pointing out that the SFTS phlebovirus may have been present in Japan prior to its characterisation in China.

Heightened surveillance of acute febrile illness in China since 2009 has led to the identification of a severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) with an unknown cause. Infection with _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ has been suggested as a cause, but the pathogen has not been detected in most patients on laboratory testing. A novel virus, designated SFTS bunyavirus, was isolated from patients who presented with fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, and multiorgan dysfunction. RNA sequence analysis revealed that the virus was a newly identified member of the genus _Phlebovirus_ of the family _Bunyaviridae_. Electron-microscopical examination revealed virions with the morphologic characteristics of bunyaviruses. The presence of the virus was confirmed in 171 patients with SFTS from 6 provinces by detection of viral RNA, specific antibodies to the virus in blood, or both. Serologic assays showed a virus-specific immune response in all 35 pairs of serum samples collected from patients during the acute and convalescent phases of the illness. (Yu XJ, Liang MF, Zhang SY, Liu Y, Li JD, Sun YL, et al. Fever with thrombocytopenia associated with a novel bunyavirus in China. N Engl J Med. 2011;364:1523-1532).

In a recent publication (International Journal of Infectious Diseases, Volume 17, Issue 3, Pages e206-e208, March 2013), Hongbin Chen reported an investigation of a group of 3 patients with proven SFTS and one with probable SFTS for whom epidemiological data show person-to-person transmission characteristics. No tick bite was reported by any of them. The clinical diagnosis and differential diagnosis of this newly recognized disease are of great importance. SFTS needs to be differentiated clinically from other infectious diseases, such as human anaplasmosis, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, and leptospirosis. The symptoms of SFTS were nonspecific.

Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease in 6 epidemic provinces of China and was identified to be caused by a novel bunyavirus in 2009. It is progressive in nature and potentially fatal. SFTS usually occurs as sporadic cases and is considered [but not proven] to be a tick-transmitted disease. The authors describe a group of 3 patients with proven SFTS and one with probable SFTS for whom the epidemiological data show person-to-person transmission characteristics. The index patient and 2 secondary patients died. None reported a tick bite. - Mod.CP
