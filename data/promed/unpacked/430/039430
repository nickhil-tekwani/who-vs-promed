Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Ichkeul Natural Park, Ghazala, Bizerte
Date of start of the outbreak: 24 Nov 2016
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Natural park
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Common Coot: _Fulica atra_ (Rallidae) / - / 17 / 17 / 0 / 0
Eurasian Wigeon: _Anas penelope_ (Anatidae) / - / 13 / 13 / 0 / 0
Affected population: On 24 Nov 2016, 30 Eurasian wigeons (_Anas penelope_) and common coots (_Fulica atra_) were found dead in Ichkeul Natural Park (wetland), in the framework of the strengthened surveillance in wetland areas (REPIOM network). On 30 Nov 2016, the laboratory of the Veterinary Research Institute in Tunis confirmed the presence of H5 virus in the samples taken on the animals.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: Tunisia is located in the main migratory corridor for wild birds going to Africa from Europe during winter migration. Migration is ongoing and this viral strain must have been carried over by migrating birds. According to the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code, article 10.4.1, provision 8, this outbreak does not modify the sanitary status of the country as affected birds are wild and thus are not included in the OIE definition of poultry. A 3-km [approx. 1.8 mi] protection zone and a 10-km [approx 6.2 mi] surveillance zone were implemented. There is no industrial poultry farm within the protection zone, and 8 broiler farms within the surveillance zone. Surveillance measures strengthened within the surveillance zone and the whole country. Access to Ichkeul Natural Park was suspended.

Control measures
Measures applied: surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; control of wildlife reservoirs; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Veterinary Research Institute in Tunis (National laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Common coot / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 30 Nov 2016 / positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[As mentioned in the epidemiological comments, "Ichkeul National Park contains important natural habitats that serve as an essential wintering site for an exceptional density of western Palaearctic waterfowl. In certain years, more than 300 000 ducks, geese and coots may be present at the same time. It is one of the 4 top over-wintering sites in the western Mediterranean.

"The park supports species that are of worldwide conservation interest such as white-headed duck (_Oxyura leucocephala_), ferruginous duck (_Aythya nyroca_) and marbled duck (_Marmaronetta angustirostris_)." See more at http://africannaturalheritage.org/lake-ichkeul-tunisia/. - Mod.CRD
