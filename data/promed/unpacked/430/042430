[Recognizing that upwards of 70 percent of newly emerging diseases
are zoonotic in origin, ProMED-mail will be posting "undiagnosed"
illness reports on both the animal health list (AHEAD) and the
emerging diseases list (EDR) until a definitive diagnosis is made
that would place the reports out of the AHEAD list. - Mod.MPP]

60 Students and Teachers Develop Febrile Illness in Mizhi County (Shaanxi)
-----------------------------------------------
Students and teachers at Liujiamao Primary School in Qiaohecha
Village, Mizhi County, Shaanxi Province have been coming down with
febrile illness since 12 Jun 2006. As of yesterday [Sun 18 Jun 2006],
there were already 33 students with febrile illness. Three teachers
also became infected. After receiving approval from the education
department, the school suspended classes from 14 Jun 2006.
Another 30 students at Qiaohecha Central Primary School, not far from
Liujiamao Primary, have also developed febrile symptoms, and one
teacher has been infected. Based on reports, ill students are
concentrated in the pre-school class which has now also suspended classes.
At the Pediatrics Department of Mizhi County Hospital, an attending
physician explained that based on available information, it appears
that most students developed respiratory infections because of the
high temperature and dry air. A smaller portion of students are
suffering from mumps and whooping cough. This is due to poor rural
health care and the fact that parents do not get required
immunizations for their children.
According to Director Chang Xianzhang of the Mizhi County Center for
Disease Control, the outbreak among students in Qiaohecha Village is
basically under control. From analysis of symptoms, the preliminary
determination is acute viral influenza. Because health care in the
county is limited, no lab tests have been carried out on the virus,
and the identity of the pathogen is not yet known.

[Any of several common respiratory pathogens could be responsible for
this outbreak of febrile illness. However, it is late in the season
for an outbreak of human (seasonal) influenza, and the contagious
nature of the illness makes H5N1 avian influenza virus an unlikely
candidate. Indeed, the association of the outbreak with dry air
conditions suggests involvement of a pathogen not propagated by
airborne transmission. ProMED-mail would welcome further information
from informed sources in the region.
The translator has stressed that the location of the outbreak is in
the province of Shaanxi, which should not be confused with the
similarly named Shanxi province. The 2 provinces are adjacent in
north central China. Shaanxi is the more southerly; their locations
can be viewed at
