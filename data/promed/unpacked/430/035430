1st report of Bipolaris leaf blight of coconut (_Cocos nucifera_) caused by
_Bipolaris incurvata_ in mainland India

Coconut (_Cocos nucifera_) is an important plantation crop in India,
cultivated for oil and raw materials used in the coir industry. Between
October and December 2004, a disease survey was conducted in Erode, Salem,
Coimbatore and Dharmapuri districts in the state of Tamil Nadu. A new leaf
blight disease was observed on 6-10 year-old coconut palms in all areas
surveyed. Symptoms first appeared as tiny, water-soaked flecks on the
leaflets of the lower fronds. These flecks expanded and became circular or
oval-shaped, brown spots with a dark brown border, often surrounded by a
yellow halo. As the disease developed, these leaf spots coalesced. In due
course, the same symptoms were observed on the upper palm fronds.
A fungus was consistently isolated from diseased leaves onto potato
dextrose agar (PDA) medium at 20 plus or minus 2 C under near UV light. The
mycelium was septate, branched and brown in colour. Straight or flexuous
conidiophores arose mainly in small groups and were, 500 micrometers long,
7- 12 micrometers thick and often swollen to 16-20 micrometers at the base.
Conidia were typically curved, fusiform, septate with 8-13 pseudo-septa,
pale straw coloured with a size ranging from 100-150 x 19- 22 micrometers.
Based on the symptoms, mycelia and conidial characters, the fungus was
identified as _Bipolaris incurvata_ (Ellis, 1971).
To confirm pathogenicity, a spore suspension (3.5 million conidia per ml)
was sprayed onto wounded leaf pieces in petri dishes lined with moist
cotton. Detached, wounded leaf pieces sprayed with sterile distilled water
served as control. The petri dishes were maintained at 20 plus or minus 2
deg C under near UV light. Inoculated leaf pieces produced typical necrotic
spots after 7 days incubation. The fungus was consistently re-isolated from
infected leaf pieces onto PDA medium, completing Koch's postulates. Control
plants did not show any symptoms.
This pathogen has previously been reported on coconut from the Indian
Andaman Islands (Rao, 1988), USA (Florida), Jamaica (Farr et al., 1989),
Australia, the Philippines and the Seychelles (Uchida & Aragaki, 1991). To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of this disease on
coconut in mainland India.

[_Bipolaris incurvata_(syn. _Helminthosporium incurvatum_ or _Drechslera
incurvata_ causes coconut leaf blight (CLB). It is a minor pathogen of
coconut but it can be severe in nurseries. There are no alternate hosts of
CLB. CLB is present in Australasia, Central and South America, Pacific and
Seychelles. It is an invasive pathogen and is listed as a new emerging and
re-emerging plant disease in the United States. Researchers realized that
NaCl applications could help restore infertile soils in the Philippines
back to productive plantings. In the mid-1970's, researchers found
applications of NaCl would suppress leaf spot disease caused by CLB on
coconut seedlings and that this treatment worked as well as fungicides. The
relative cost of NaCl versus chemical fungicides resulted in significant
savings to farmers.
Because of lethal yellowing disease, growers are advised to plant resistant
Malayan strains, often called dwarf or pygmy coconuts, and labelled yellow,
golden, red, and green, according to the color of their fruits, such as
'Golden Malayan Dwarf'. The Malayan palms are very similar to the Jamaican
Tall except for having straight trunks. The red strain is the most rugged
of the 3 but has the least attractive foliage. The variety `Maypan', a
hybrid of Malayan x Panama Tall, has the most robust and rapid growth yet
retains its resistance to lethal yellowing disease. All Coconut Palms are
highly salt-tolerant and make nice street trees if planted when they are
tall enough. Be aware that falling fruit can damage vehicles or hit
pedestrians and the flower stalks (in spring) or developing fruit (summer)
may need to be removed. Lethal yellowing disease, virus diseases, and fungi
all affect coconut palms. Ganoderma butt rot can infect the lower trunk
and roots, and can kill the palm. !
Avoid injury to the palm in this area. There is no control for butt rot,
only prevention.
