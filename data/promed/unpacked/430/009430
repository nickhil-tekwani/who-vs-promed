A new species of bacterium that causes leprosy has been identified
through intensive genetic analysis of a pair of lethal infections, a
research team reports in the December [2008] issue of the American
Journal of Clinical Pathology.

All cases of leprosy, an ancient disease that still maims and kills
in the developing world, previously had been thought to be caused by
a single species of bacterium, said lead author Xiang-Yang Han, MD,
PhD, associate professor in Laboratory Medicine at The University of
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center [in Houston].

"We have identified a 2nd species of leprosy mycobacterium, and in
identifying this killing organism we've better defined the disease
that it causes, diffuse lepromatous leprosy (DLL)." Han said. DLL
occurs mainly in Mexico and the Caribbean.

There are hundreds of thousands of new cases of leprosy worldwide
each year, but the disease is rare in the United States, with 100-200
new cases annually, mostly among immigrants. Leprosy initially
attacks skin and nerve cells. It can be successfully treated with
antibiotics in its early and intermediate stages.

R Geetha Nair, MD, a physician with Maricopa Integrated Health System
in Phoenix (Arizona), contacted Han in 2007 for help confirming a
possible leprosy diagnosis in a patient who died that February. The
patient, a 53-year-old man originally from Mexico, was admitted that
month for treatment of extensive leg wounds. While undergoing
antibiotic treatment and additional diagnostic testing the next day,
he was stricken with high fever and shock. He died after 10 days in
intensive care. Analysis of autopsied tissue at the Phoenix hospital
suggested a diagnosis of diffuse lepromatous leprosy, a form first
described in Mexico in 1852. Han said DLL uniquely attacks a
patient's skin vasculature, blocking or impeding blood flow. This
leads to extensive skin death at late stage and may cause secondary
infection and fatal shock. The DLL bacterium had never been studied.

The research team also analyzed samples from a similar lethal case of
a 31-year-old man in 2002 with so much skin damage that he was first
admitted to a hospital burn unit.

Han and MD Anderson colleagues diagnose infections in cancer
patients. Han developed in 2002 a way to identify unusual bacteria by
analyzing small but significant differences in the 16S ribosomal RNA
gene. "This is like a fingerprint analysis to solve crimes," Han
said. He has discovered and named several new bacterial species that
cause unusual infections.

Across a group of bacteria called mycobacteria, the 16S rRNA gene is
93 to 100 percent identical. There are 110 species of mycobacteria,
with those causing tuberculosis and leprosy the best known.
Sequencing the 16S rRNA gene is a fast and accurate way to identify
mycobacteria, which usually grow slowly, Han noted. Accurate
identification improves patient care decisions.

Han and colleagues compared the lethal bacterium's 16S rRNA gene and
5 other genes to other mycobacteria. They found that the bacterium
had the most in common with _Mycobacterium leprae_, previously
thought to be the sole cause of leprosy.

Yet there were also significant differences with _M. leprae_. The
lethal bacterium's 16S rRNA gene sequence differed by 2.1 percent.
"That may sound like a small difference, but to anyone familiar with
mycobacteria, it's huge," Han said. In all previously studied _M.
leprae_ strains, no variation in the 16S rRNA gene had been noted at
all.

Analysis of the other 5 genes turned up more differences. The
researchers named the new species _Mycobacterium lepromatosis_. They
have since confirmed _M. lepromatosis_ as the cause of 2 lethal cases
of DLL in Singapore.

The team is working to better understand the bacterium and how it
causes DLL. They are attempting to sequence the entire _M.
lepromatosis_ genome and looking for ways to grow the organism in the
lab. Neither leprosy mycobacteria can be cultured because over
millions of years they lost genes necessary to survive outside their
hosts, a process called reductive evolution.

One of the puzzles of leprosy is that _M. leprae_ strains collected
worldwide are virtually identical, while the clinical features of the
disease and its severity vary greatly both geographically and from
person to person. Evidence suggests that individual host immune
factors play the key role in determining how the disease progresses.

The authors conclude that the new species _M. lepromatosis_ could
account for some of this geographical and individual variation.

[Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by _Mycobacterium
leprae_ and is still a major health problem in the developing
countries of Asia, Latin America, and Africa. _M. leprae_ remains
uncultivable on artificial media, which complicates the ability to
identify its source, reservoir, and mode of transmission.
Understanding the epidemiology of leprosy is a prerequisite for
effective control of the disease. The use of modern molecular and
immunological tools has become a valuable addition to epidemiological
research. Molecular methods of strain typing would allow tracking of
individual bacterial strains, would strengthen epidemiological
studies, and would contribute to our understanding of the epidemiology
of leprosy within families and geographic regions.

By sequencing the 16S rRNA gene, the news release reports that a new
species of mycobacterium is said to have been identified in 2
patients in the USA, one of whom was of Mexican origin, and 2
patients from Singapore. All 4 patients were said to have died of
diffuse lepromatous leprosy (DLL) on the basis of clinical
presentation and histopathology.

The 4 patients described in the news release above may have had
Lucio's phenomenon complicating DLL. Lucio's phenomenon is a severe
necrotizing reaction that is most commonly seen in Mexico and Central
America and can be fatal. The epidermis is necrotic with vasculitis or
vasculopathy, and acid-fast bacilli can be found within endothelial
cells.
