Nearly 300 sickened at spiritual retreat
----------------------------------------
An outbreak of shigellosis sickened almost 300 people who attended a
spiritual retreat in southwest Oregon. 9 people were briefly hospitalized
with the intestinal illness, which causes diarrhea, vomiting, fever and
abdominal cramps. Symptoms generally disappear in 3 to 5 days even without
medical treatment.
The 280 people who got sick were among some 1400 people from the USA and 22
countries who were at the center 20 miles northwest of Roseburg between 22
Jul and 7 Aug 2005. The retreat, sponsored by the Know Thyself as Soul
Foundation International, was for practitioners of Sant Mat, which espouses
meditation as a means of spiritual awakening.
The source of the outbreak has not been pinpointed, but it was likely
passed from an infected person through water or food at the center, said
William E. Keene, senior epidemiologist with the Oregon Department of Human
Services. Retreat organizers notified Douglas County health officials of
the illnesses 27 Jul 2005. When state health officials arrived a day later,
they entered a scene of misery for many of the participants.
Dozens of people were ill with fever, vomiting and diarrhea, he said, and
were being cared for by other retreat participants. "A lot of these people
didn't have a home to go to," he said. "Many had come from around the
world. They couldn't just pack up and go home, because they had plane
reservations."
Retreat participants lived in tents at the center and had access to
portable toilets. Temperatures in the mid-90s added to their discomfort,
Keene said.

[This posting adds the information that participants in the retreat were
from all over the USA and the world. Secondary cases in contacts at the
retreat or after the participants return home may occur, since the disease
has a very low infectious dose (less than 50 bacilli) and easily transmits
from person to person. - Mod.LL]
