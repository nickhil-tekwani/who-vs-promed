BIRD DIE-OFF - NEPAL (02)

Although it is a little early in the season, the bird die-off in
Kapilvastu, Nepal, is suspicious for flaviviruses, especially West Nile
virus. West Nile virus is primarily an infection of birds and culicine
mosquitoes, with humans and horses serving as incidental hosts.
Amplification of virus in this bird-mosquito-bird cycle begins when adult
mosquitoes emerge in early spring and continues until fall. Among humans,
the incidence of disease peaks in late summer and early fall. This is how
this infection presented in New York City back in 1999. We all observed
bird deaths spreading across North America over the next few years followed
by human infection across the continent.
I would suggest collecting the birds or their sera, and mosquitoes, and
sending them to be tested for WNV. There are no human vaccines available.
So far, mosquito control programs and personal protection from mosquito
bites are the only available public health measures to control WNV.

[Indeed, West Nile fever may be included in the differential diagnosis list
of the described bird die-off in south Nepal, reportedly affecting crows
and doves. West Nile fever and Japanese encephalitis, another flavivirus
zoonosis, have been recorded in Nepal in the past. With current
temperatures in the vicinity of Kapilvastu fluctuating between 24 and 35
Celsius, vector activity cannot be ruled out. Other disease agents to be
taken into consideration are avian influenza and various organic and
inorganic toxic agents, botulism included. Results of the laboratory
investigations are anticipated, while keeping in mind that a substantial
percentage of such investigations remain, unfortunately, inconclusive. -
