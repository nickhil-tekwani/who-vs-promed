More than 30 hepatitis A infections potentially linked to eating dates are being investigated in the United Kingdom. Since the start of 2021, 31 people have fallen ill in different parts of England and Wales and a number of them reported eating dates. Those sick range in age from 6 to 93 years old, and 25 have been hospitalized. Public Health England (PHE) and the Food Standards Agency (FSA) are investigating the non-travel-related cases of hepatitis A.

Marks & Spencer recently recalled Stuffed Medjool Date Selection, 350 grams with a best-before [date] of 13 Jul 2021. In mid-April 2021, Sainsbury's recalled all dates of 200- and 500-gram Taste the Difference Medjool Dates that had supplier or site code K0014 EW. They had been sold since 24 Dec 2020. Both were supplied from Jordan. Epidemiological and supply chain investigations revealed a potential link and showed that several sick people had eaten dates. Testing of product from one supplier was positive for hepatitis A.

Sainsbury's has a number of date providers and suspended supply from the one involved in the incident. The grower listed on the recalled product is Progressive Agricultural Investment Co. There are no confirmed links between patients and the Marks & Spencer dates as yet, but the retailer issued a recall because they received dates from the same supplier as Sainsbury's.

The Jordan-based firm also supplied a brand of dates to a UK importer and wholesaler. This business has withdrawn and recalled the product based on the epidemiological evidence and supply chain investigations which indicated 2 patients had eaten this brand of dates but had not reported having Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer Medjool dates.

Kate Folkard, deputy director for the National Infections Service at PHE, said: "Public Health England and the Food Standards Agency are investigating 31 cases of hepatitis A, thought to be linked to the consumption of dates. The risk to public health remains low, and those who have recently consumed dates do not need a hepatitis A vaccine. Our advice remains the same, anyone showing symptoms of hepatitis A or has been in close contact with someone with hepatitis A should contact their GP."

Hepatitis A is an infection of the liver caused by hepatitis A virus (HAV). Symptoms develop, on average, about 4 weeks after becoming infected, and last up to 2 months. They include feeling tired and unwell, abdominal pain, feeling or being sick, dark urine and a yellowing of the skin called jaundice. Severity of illness and risk of death increases with age, and more severe cases may require hospitalization.
