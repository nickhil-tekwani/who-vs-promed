Primers and Protocols for SARS-associated Coronavirus Identification
--------------------------------------------------------------------
[Dr. Christian Drosten is making the following information available in
response to many requests from laboratories dealing with suspected or
probable cases of SARS which do not feel at present sufficiently informed
and involved.- Mod CP]

Following our last posting in ProMED-mail [SARS - WORLDWIDE (16): ETIOLOGY
20030328.0774], we have received many requests to communicate our PCR
primers and protocols for the detection of the coronavirus suspected to be
linked to SARS. We are pleased to accede to this request on the
understanding that ProMed-mail recipients are aware that:

(1) The virus detected by this PCR is only suspected/has not been confirmed
yet to be an etiological cause of SARS;

(2) a negative finding in this PCR is not sufficient to exclude SARS;

(3) healthy controls have to be tested before the test is used; and

(4) the primers have not been published.

The protocol is a preliminary one that is not yet thoroughly optimized. It
yields clear positivity in respiratory specimens of both Frankfurt cases of
SARS. The primers used are specifically targeting a fraction of the
polymerase gene of the coronavirus found in these patients (refer to above
mentioned posting for further details).

The protocol is available on the Homepage of the Bernhard-Nocht-Institute,
<http://www15.bni-hamburg.de/bni/bni2/neu2/getfile.acgi?area_engl=news&pid=620> .

The primers are available from stock at Tib-Molbiol, a German biotech
company based in Berlin. Aliquots of these primer stocks have been tested
in our laboratory to rule out mis-synthesis. Contact and order via
<ulass@tib-molbiol.de> or <dna@tib-molbiol.de>. We do not have personal
orfinancial relations to this company.

Those who are willing to establish this test can request from me (e-mail
below) in-vitro transcribed positive control RNA that will be available
from the middle of this week.
