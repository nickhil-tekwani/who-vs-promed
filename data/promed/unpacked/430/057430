The 1st 2 confirmed cases of Rift Valley Fever [RVF] in cattle have
been reported in the Kajiado district [in the Rift Valley, Kenya].
Previously, only cases of infected human beings had been reported, a
situation that raised eyebrows as the disease is usually transmitted
from animals to human beings.
The 2 cattle cases were found in the Mashuru division and in
Loitokitok [on the Tanzanian frontier, south of Kajiado], which is
now a district.
Local district veterinary officer Dr. Jackton Achola told a special
district steering group (DSG) meeting that the 2 samples of blood
from cattle, which had tested positive were among hundreds taken at
random across the district.
Following the confirmation that RVF was present in the district, the
veterinary officer said that an existing quarantine in Mashuru
division, which had been issued to control lumpy skin disease, would
continue to be in force.
Achola said that he would share the 100 000 doses of vaccines
supplied by the government with the new Loitokitok district -- which
will get 40 000 doses -- while 60 000 will be used to vaccinate
livestock in the Kajiado district.
He asked livestock keepers in the district to keep off livestock
products for at least 7 days after the vaccination in order to avoid
possible infection. [This sensible precautionary measure seems to
reflect the possibility that vaccination might be applied in
incubating animals or animals that could get infected shortly after
vaccination, before immunity is established. - Mod.AS]
Meanwhile, there are suspicions that a 17-year-old girl died of RVF
in Msabaha, a sub location of the Malindi district [north of
Mombasa], after family members refused to take her to hospital due to
religious beliefs.
Malindi district officer, Herman Shambi, said that the girl's
relatives are members of the Miracle Revival Fellowship Pentecostal
church, which considers medication and hospitalization as sinful as
it amounts to doubting God.
He said the girl died at home as family members were dangerously
handling her, oblivious of the danger they were exposing themselves
to since they had not taken her anywhere for medical examination.
The girl could be the 5th victim to succumb to the viral disease in
Malindi district though it has been difficult to establish the number
of deaths due to reluctance by the locals to seek medical attention.
Malindi district medical officer, Dr. Anisa Omar, said he would
comment on the issue at a later date.

[According to WHO's most recent available update on the RVF situation
in Kenya and Somalia (31 Jan 2007), the Kajiado district is included
in the regions where numerous human cases have been reported; see map at:
<http://www.who.int/csr/AFRO_RVF_20070130.png>.
Kenya's notification to the OIE of clinical RVF cases in animals
(sheep, goats, cattle, and camels) was submitted to the OIE on 9 Jan
2007, referring to an outbreak in Galmagara, Garissa, the southern
part of the North-Eastern province, which reportedly had started on 4
Dec 2006 and confirmed on 22 Dec 2006. The notification, including a
map, is available at:
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=4487>.
The current news on the identification of RVF in animals in another
part of the country, likewise exhibiting human cases and mortalities,
is based upon (serological?) surveillance at random in susceptible
species; unfortunately, information on clinical cases in animals is
unavailable, with human patients serving as the sentinels. This is
not a new phenomenon. A forgotten piece of history: RVF was
identified for the 1st time in South Africa, in 1950, only when
several veterinarians got infected, exhibiting influenza-like
symptoms, after performing PM [postmortem] in an affected bull in the
Bloemfontein Artificial insemination (AI) centre. This led to the
discovery that the virus had already been circulating, causing heavy
losses, for about 6 months in rural areas, infecting hundreds of
thousands animals and thousands of humans without being suspected nor
identified. Similar situations have occurred since in several other countries.
In view of the reports on the occurrence of RVF in humans and animals
in Kenya and Tanzania, and in humans in Somalia (wherefrom
information on animal disease is still anticipated), it will not
surprise if the disease occurs in other receptive countries, such as
Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan, Egypt, and Yemen. Enhanced
alertness and surveillance are required.
