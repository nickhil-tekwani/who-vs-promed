Reports of more deaths indicate that the state's malaria situation is
worsening, causing more than 40 check-up camps to be set up in the
worst affected districts of Lakhimpur and Golaghat. A source in the
health department put the toll at 49 while informing The Statesman
that, so far, 3288 people had been affected.
Malaria was said to have claimed 24 lives in Lakhimpur, 14 in
Golaghat district, 5 in Jorhat, 3 in Marigaon, 2 in Sonitpur and one
in Nalbari. A 5-member team of the National Vector-borne Disease
Control Programme has arrived in the state to head for Lakhimpur.
Experts from the Kolkata-based All-India Institute of Hygiene and
Public Health are in Golaghat and Lakhimpur. An alert has been
sounded in such vulnerable districts as Karbi Anglong, North Cachar,
Kamrup and parts of Nagaon. Most tea plantation areas have been
identified as malaria-prone.

[Lakhimpur and Galaghat districts are located in the state of Assam
in Northern India. Malaria is prevalent with frequent epidemics and
chloroquine resistance probably widespread, although precise data on
chloroquine resistance in Assam are lacking. See our posting from 7
Jan 2005 on drug resistance in malaria in India. - Mod.EP]
