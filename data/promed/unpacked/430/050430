Dien Bien Phu bird flu death is 5th of the year [2009]
------------------------------------------------------
A man with bird flu has died in northern Viet Nam, after nearly 6
months of having no case recorded in the country, the health ministry
said Monday [30 Nov 2009]. The victim, a 23-year-old man in Dien Bien
Province's Dien Bien Phu Town, had duck blood pudding a week before he
fell sick on 18 Nov 2009 with symptoms of high fever, cough and
respiratory difficulties, according to the ministry's Department of
Preventive Health and Environment. He was admitted to the provincial
Dien Bien General Hospital on 26 Nov 2009 and died of pneumonia 2 days
later.

A test conducted by the Hanoi-based National Institute of Hygiene an
Epidemiology on Sunday showed that he was inflicted with the H5N1
virus. Dien Bien Province had reported bird flu outbreaks at Noong
Luong and Thanh Yen communes on 21 Oct 2009, but no human being had
been infected thus far.

According to the Ministry of Health, 5 people with bird flu have died
so far this year [2009], bringing the country's death toll to 57. The
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development's Animal Health
Department in June [2009] said Viet Nam has successfully curbed the
spread of the bird flu as well as 2 other livestock diseases:
foot-and-mouth disease and swine blue ear [porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome].

[Indeed a CDC Travel Advice Outbreak Notice reported that transmission
of H5N1 viruses to 2 persons through consumption of uncooked duck
blood may have occurred in Viet Nam in 2005 (see ProMED-mail reference
below). Travelers were advised to avoid foods from poultry, including
eggs and poultry blood, which had not been thoroughly cooked prior to
consumption.

Another correspondent has drawn our attention to the fact that "raw
blood soup (tiet canh in Vietnamese) is a dish made with raw blood of
ducks or geese (sometimes pigs), with peanuts and herbs on top. This
is the typical protein-rich breakfast of the country people in
Northern Viet Nam, but is dangerous because of the H5N1 bird flu
virus. It is made by taking fresh blood and sticking it in the
refrigerator to gently congeal. Raw blood soup is a Vietnamese dish
that makes very little effort to appeal to the taste buds of the
non-Vietnamese diner. Usually you will find a few chopped peanuts
scattered on top of your blood dish but that's as far as it goes for
fanciness. Blood soup has the oddest texture and tastes strangely
metallic."
