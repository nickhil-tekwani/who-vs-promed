["African swine fever (ASF) is a deadly pig disease that affects domestic and wild pigs. It is not a risk to human health, but affects animal welfare, causes severe production and economic losses and can threaten food security worldwide. The number of countries or territories affected by ASF has increased in recent years, with notifications from countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Europe and Asia.

"In the absence of an effective vaccine against ASF virus, prevention in countries free of the disease depends on strict implementation of [WOAH] standards, including epidemiological surveillance, animal identification and traceability, biosecurity measures on farms and during movement of pigs or pork products, and stringent import policies. This ensures that neither infected live pigs nor pork products are introduced into areas free of ASF, including ensuring proper disposal of waste food from aircraft, ships or vehicles coming from infected countries or zones" (Source: WOAH African swine fever portal; https://rr-europe.woah.org/en/our-missions/animal-diseases/african-swine-fever/). - Mod.CRD
