PRION DISEASE UPDATE 2011 (11)
******************************

[With the continuing decline in the number of cases in the human
population of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- abbreviated
previously as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail -- the scope of
the occasional ProMED-mail updates has been broadened to include other
prion-related diseases. In addition to vCJD, data on other forms of
CJD: sporadic, iatrogenic, familial, and GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease) are included also since they
may have some relevance to the incidence and etiology of vCJD. -

vCJD statistics
---------------
The number of deaths due to definite or probable vCJD as of Mon 5 Dec
2011 has risen to 176. No definite/probable patient remains alive, so
the total number of definite or probable vCJD cases (dead and alive)
remains 176.

The overall picture remains consistent with the view that the vCJD
outbreak in the UK is in decline, albeit now with a pronounced tail.
The 1st cases were observed in 1995, and the peak number of deaths was
28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9
in 2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in 2007, 1 in 2008, 3 in 2009, 3 in
2010, and now 5 in 2011.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the UK in the year 2011
------------------------------------------------------------
During 2011 so far [as of 5 Dec 2011], there have been 141 referrals,
73 fatal cases of sporadic CJD, 2 cases of GSS, 8 cases of familial
CJD, 5 cases of vCJD, and 3 cases of iatrogenic CJD.

Since records began in 1990, there have been 2874 referrals, 1288
fatal cases of sporadic CJD, 176 cases of vCJD, 91 cases of familial
CJD, 68 cases of iatrogenic CJD, and 45 cases of GSS.

Bullock enters food supply without being tested for BSE
-------------------------------------------------------
The Food Standards Agency has been notified that meat has entered the
food supply from a bullock aged over 72 months that had not been
tested for BSE. A negative BSE test result is mandatory for cattle
slaughtered for human consumption at more than 72 months of age.

It is very unlikely that the bullock was infected with BSE and as
specified risk material (SRM) was removed, any risk to human health is
extremely low. SRM is the parts of cattle most likely to carry BSE
infectivity.

The bullock, aged 75 months and 7 days, was slaughtered at C&S Meats
Ltd's abattoir in Dorset, on 2 Sep 2011. The error was discovered on
27 Oct 2011 in the course of routine cross-checks of slaughter and BSE
test data.

According to BSE regulations, the untested cow, plus the one
slaughtered before and the 2 after should not have entered the food
supply. However, by the time the failure was discovered, the
associated carcasses had left the premises. Subsequent checks traced a
20 kg piece of meat from the untested bullock that has since been
destroyed and indicate that the rest of the meat from the carcasses is
no longer in the food supply.

[3] New prion -- 4th form of BSE

New 4th variant of prion protein causing of BSE found in 2 cows in
Switzerland
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The international team of researchers identified 2 Swiss cows with a
new form of mad cow disease in a study released online on Friday [18
Nov 2011}. In the same region, (St Gallen, Switzerland) researchers
found a deceased cow that had a new form of mad cow disease. Bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), more commonly known as mad cow
disease, is caused by prion proteins that become tangled up and cause
brain damage decades after infection. Humans can become infected by
the prion proteins and develop [variant] Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(vCJD), a neurodegenerative disease, 1st reported in 1996. Since then,
health experts have identified 217 patients from 11 countries with the
disease.

2 cows died in the Swiss countryside, an 8 year old from an accident
and a 15 year old that was put down, and mandatory testing gave a
positive result for BSE. Previously, scientists had uncovered 3 prion
variants, but when the current team examined the prions of the 2 cows,
they found a 4th unknown variant.

"The interpretation of these findings remains difficult because
neuropathologic and systematic clinical data for the 2 cases are not
available," the authors wrote in their paper in the journal Emerging
Infectious Diseases, published by the United States Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. The journal released the data on
Friday online before the article appears in the journal in January
[2012].

The new prion variant raised concerns that current testing might miss
variants that can cause debilitating and lethal brain damage decades
after infection. "Nonetheless, our findings raise the possibility that
these cattle were affected by a prion disease not previously
encountered and distinct from the known types of BSE," the authors
concluded. "To confirm this possibility and to assess a potential
effect on disease control and public health, in vivo transmission
studies using transgenic mouse models and cattle are ongoing. Until
results of these studies are available, molecular diagnostic
techniques should be used so that such cases are not missed."

[In the presentation of their findings the authors of part [3] provide
the following evaluation of their research:

"We report a novel PrPres signature in 2 cows with BSE diagnoses
determined according to established criteria. Combining Western blot
analysis with an epitope mapping strategy, we ascertained that these
animals displayed an N-terminally truncated PrPres different from
currently classified BSE prions. The interpretation of these findings
remains difficult because neuropathologic and systematic clinical data
for the 2 cases are not available. Moreover, the tissue samples were
autolyzed, and the question of whether this affected the PrPres
molecular signature is of concern. Nonetheless, our findings raise the
possibility that these cattle were affected by a prion disease not
previously encountered and distinct from the known types of BSE. To
confirm this possibility and to assess a potential effect on disease
control and public health, in vivo transmission studies using
transgenic mouse models and cattle are ongoing. Until results of these
studies are available, molecular diagnostic techniques should be used
so that such cases are not missed."
