Chickens in Vietnam's northern region die of bird flu
--------------------------------------------------
Some 500 chickens in Vietnam's northern Nam Dinh province have just
died of bird flu, [making it more urgent for] the country to beef up
preventive measures, according to local newspaper Vietnam Agriculture
Friday.
Samples from dead fowl in Truc Ninh district tested positive to the
H5 strain of the bird flu virus. The local veterinarian bureau,
therefore, has culled the remainder of the affected flock of 917
chickens.
Also early this week, southern Long An province spotted new outbreaks
that killed and led to the culling of 3871 chickens and ducks. Some
450 affected chickens have been recently reported in 2 other southern
provinces, Dong Thap and Tien Giang.
Vietnam's Department of Animal Health said outbreaks happened in 7
wards and communes in the 6 southern localities of Can Tho, Bac Lieu,
Long An, Tra Vinh, Hau Giang and Binh Phuoc between 1-10 Dec 2004,
killing and leading to the culling of nearly 11 000 fowls.
The recent relapse of bird flu in both southern and northern
localities (it has not been active in the northern region for some 4
months) has prompted stronger preventive measures. Cities and
provinces [will carry out decontamination and clean-up] operations in
high-risk areas more frequently and will keep closer surveillance on
transport and sales of poultry, especially during the upcoming Lunar
New Year Festival.
Local health experts express concerns over the relapse of bird flu
among fowl as well as humans this winter, [since the prevailing]
weather [conditions] favor the development of [viral infections].
Local doctors have just confirmed that a 16-year-old girl from
southern Tay Ninh province is infected with the H5N1 strain of bird
flu virus.
The patient is in critical condition, on a respirator, said [a
representative of] the Hospital of Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh
City.
Bird flu started to break out in Vietnam in December 2003. To date,
it has killed 20 people and led to the slaughter of more than 40
million poultry in the country.
