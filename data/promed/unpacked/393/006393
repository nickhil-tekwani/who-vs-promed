The accounts I have been getting out of the panhandle of Texas -- where
they get hantavirus infections each summer -- suggest that the single case
story is not universal. It depends on the human story behind it, not the
bug. The Texans seem to go in a family group to clear up empty
homes/stables/barns and then go to hospital together. Single cases are from
lone activities.

[The original commentary included the following: "This is the 1st Canadian
death from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome since 2002. It is quite rare that
a cluster of 3 related family members were infected simultaneously....". It
should be "It is quite rare in Alberta that a cluster of 3 related family
members were infected simultaneously, according to Deputy Provincial Health
Officer Dr Karen Grimsrud...". Grimsrud says the case is unusual because it
involves 3 people, where they typically see single infections. "They have a
common exposure. We've never had that before," she said. "We've had single
cases, but not the cluster of cases."
