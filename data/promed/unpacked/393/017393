Bird flu has been found in a poultry flock at Neyaashiinigmiing. [Neyaashiinigmiing is a reserve within Bruce County, Ontario. It is 1 of the parcels of land administered by the Chippewas of Nawash Unceded First Nation. Extracted from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neyaashiinigmiing_27. - Mod.TG]

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) announced on [Thu 31 Mar 2022] the highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1) was at the Cape.

Last week the CFIA also confirmed the disease was in turkey flocks in Woolwich Township, in Waterloo Region; in Zorra Township in Oxford County; and Township of Guelph/Eramosa in Wellington County.

A notice posted on the Chippewas of Nawash Unceded First Nation website on [Fri 1 Apr 2022] also confirmed bird flu in a poultry flock at Neyaashiinigmiing but didn't identify the variety of bird involved.

CFIA was notified of a potentially sick poultry flock at Neyaashiinigmiing and the agency visited the site and collected samples for testing on [Mon 28 Mar 2022].

One flock tested positive for avian influenza in a preliminary test on [Wed 30 Mar 2022] then further testing [Fri 1 Apr 2022] confirmed it was avian influenza H5N1.

"The risk to humans is very low," the Nawash notice said. "Human infections are rare and usually transmitted through close contact of infected bird feces." Bird flu is a contagious viral infection affecting several species of food-producing birds as well as pet birds and wild birds. "At this time, assume all wild birds, fowl, geese and ducks are infected," the notice said.

The federal bulletin said the agency placed the premises at Neyaashiinigmiing under quarantine and is establishing movement control measures and recommending enhanced biosecurity for other farms within that area, the bulletin said. It advised anyone with poultry or other susceptible birds to practice good biosecurity habits. "Avian influenza is spreading in wild bird populations across the globe and presents a significant national concern as birds migrate to Canada."

The Monroe County Health Department has reported the county's first case of avian flu. The highly infectious disease was detected in a backyard flock of chickens, ducks and pheasants. The county did not identify where the property was located but said the remaining birds were euthanized to prevent the spread of the disease. "We urge anyone with backyard poultry, ducks or geese, and game hunters who come into contact with wild waterfowl or turkeys, to take extra precautions. Songbirds do not appear susceptible to this virus, so backyard birdfeeders are considered safe," said county health commissioner Dr Michael Mendoza.

Avian flu has been detected in several states and recently New York. The state this week banned all outdoor exhibits or shows that involve fowl and the Seneca Park Zoo had taken similar measures. The county is urging all poultry producers to limit outdoor access for their birds, and to keep them away from wild ducks and geese and their droppings.

A strain of avian flu state officials have deemed "highly pathogenic" has arrived on the South Fork, where a farm in Sag Harbor lost a flock of about 6000 game birds on [23 Mar 2022] due to the infection and its potential to spread.

The Sag Harbor outbreak, at Spring Farm on Clay Pit Road, was one of 3 discovered in Suffolk County and a total of 6 statewide. In February [2022], 8 birds in a residential backyard flock were euthanized, and on [25 Mar 2022] the virus was detected in a flock of several hundred. Both the State Department of Agriculture and the Suffolk County Health Department declined to specify the locations of the 1st and 3rd outbreaks, but the owner of the 82 year old Spring Farm, confirmed on [Fri 1 Apr 2022] that his flock -- mostly pheasants and ducks raised for sport hunting -- was completely devastated. "It no doubt came from a couple of wild ducks coming into my pond," he said by phone. "I think I'm going to go out of business, probably, but I'm old enough to retire. It's just about that time. This, I think, is the deciding factor."

Dr Joy Bennett, the chief veterinarian with New York State's Department of Agriculture and Markets, said in an interview on [Fri 1 Apr 2022] that there is no risk this strain of avian flu can spread to humans, but the risk to chickens, turkeys, ducks, and other fowl is severe. Sick birds and their eggs do not reach the market for consumers. "This year [2022], it is very worrisome for our poultry flocks because it's a very virulent strain," she said. "It's nothing we've really seen before. This year in particular is really the time poultry producers should be looking or the signs and taking preventative measures."

Those actions, Dr Bennett said, include keeping birds inside whenever possible so they don't encounter the wild birds carrying the virus. People should not feed wild birds like ducks, geese, and even songbirds. Visitors to farms or people's backyards should be limited or prohibited, and those who work directly with poultry should wash their hands and disinfect their boots and tools frequently. Food should be stored securely, she said, "so they don't attract wild birds or rodents. Rodents may not get infected, but they can carry the virus on their feet or fur."

Commissioner Richard Ball of the State Department of Agriculture and Markets described this as an unusual situation, but one threatening poultry farms across New York and 17 other states as well. On [25 Mar 2022] he banned live fowl shows and swaps as a precaution. It's the biggest concern since a major outbreak of avian flu in 2015 in the Midwestern United States, he said. That outbreak claimed the lives of 50 million birds and was caused by wild bird migration. At that time, transportation of poultry from the Midwest was banned.

"We've got a flyway in the Midwest, and a pretty significant one on the East Coast. This is how we're coming to find it in New York State this year," Mr Ball said. "We're reacting very quickly and doing lots of testing to hopefully minimize it. It's as random as a duck or goose or wild fowl getting into the wrong areas." In the February [2022] incident in Suffolk, he said, "The people with the flock had been feeding the wild birds flying through."

Dr Bennett said signs of the avian flu in sick birds include swimming in circles and "twisted" necks. She advised people to report possible infections by phone or by email to <dai@agrcilutre.ny.gov>. "We have a field staff spread out throughout the state -- a very robust staff to address this," she said.

https://www.tahc.texas.gov/news/2022/2022-04-03_HPAI.pdf


The Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) and the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in a commercial pheasant flock (poultry) in Erath County, Texas. This is the first confirmation of HPAI in Texas.

Following an increase in bird deaths, samples from the flock were tested at the Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory, part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, and confirmed at the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa.

The TAHC is working closely with federal animal health officials on a joint incident response. State officials quarantined the affected premises, and birds on the property have been depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. The plan for the control of avian influenza includes coordination of resources and response, and protocols for quarantine, testing, disposal, cleaning, disinfection and monitoring.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the recent HPAI detections do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States. As a reminder, the proper handling and cooking of all poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 deg.F [74 deg.C] is recommended as a general food safety precaution.

"Texas has been actively preparing alongside the USDA to respond to HPAI," said Dr Andy Schwartz, TAHC executive director and state veterinarian. "We'd like to encourage Texas poultry owners to educate themselves on this disease and be vigilant in taking steps to protect their flocks from avian influenza."

As part of existing avian influenza response plans, Federal and State partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flock. The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and the TAHC and USDA is working to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets and in migratory wild bird populations.

Anyone involved with poultry production from the small backyard to the large commercial producer should review their biosecurity activities to assure the health of their birds. Owners of commercial and backyard poultry flocks are encouraged to closely observe their birds and report a sudden increase in the number of sick birds or bird deaths to the TAHC USDA.

In addition to practicing good biosecurity, all bird owners should create barriers between their birds and wild birds and report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to State/Federal officials. Producers are encouraged to consider bringing birds indoors, when possible, to further prevent exposures, and avoid visits to other premises that also have birds. Additional information on biosecurity for backyard flocks can be found at https://www.tahc.texas.gov/news/brochures/TAHCBrochure_AI-BiosecurityPoultry.pdf.

Additional background:
Avian influenza (AI) is caused by an influenza type A virus which can infect poultry (such as chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, domestic ducks, geese, and guinea fowl) and is carried by free flying waterfowl such as ducks, geese and shorebirds. AI viruses are classified by a combination of 2 groups of proteins: hemagglutinin or "H" proteins, of which there are 16 (H1-H16), and neuraminidase or "N" proteins, of which there are 9 (N1-N9). Many different combinations of "H" and "N" proteins are possible. Each combination is considered a different subtype and can be further broken down into different strains which circulate within flyways/geographic regions. AI viruses are further classified by their pathogenicity (low or high)--the ability of a particular virus strain to produce disease in domestic poultry.

Another 2 cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza have been detected in Iowa, in a commercial turkey flock in Sac County and in a flock of commercial breeding chickens in Humboldt County, the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship announced on [Sun 3 Apr 2022].

The Sac County operation had roughly 37 000 turkeys and the Humboldt County chicken flock had nearly 15 000, department spokeswoman Chloe Carson said [Sun 3 Apr 2022] evening. Flocks testing positive for avian influenza are culled. The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship has not identified any of the impacted operators.

This year's bird flu outbreak has hit Northwest Iowa hard -- [Sun 3 Apr 2022]'s announcement follows announcements on [Thu 31 Mar 2022] that the virus had been found in a commercial turkey operation in Cherokee County and a commercial layer chicken operation in Osceola County. Buena Vista County has been hit harder than any other county in the state this year, with the influenza detected at 4 commercial operations.

Migratory birds are believed to be responsible for spreading the highly contagious influenza to their domesticated counterparts.

The first case of bird flu this year in Iowa was reported in a backyard, mixed-species flock in Pottawattamie County at the beginning of March [2022]. Since then, the influenza has been detected in 14 flocks, both commercial and backyard.

Another case of the highly contagious bird flu which has been spreading in wild birds across Wisconsin has been found in a domesticated flock, the state Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (DATCP) said. This strain of "highly pathogenic avian influenza", called H5N1, is deadly to captive and domesticated birds -- such as those found in farms, zoos and in people's homes -- but is not as dangerous to the wild birds which are spreading it.

The newest case, found in a "backyard flock" in Rock County, resulted in the euthanizing of all the birds on the property to prevent the spread of the disease, DATCP said. It was the second confirmed case in a domestic flock. The first was found at a chicken farm in Jefferson County on [14 Mar 2022] and resulted in the euthanizing of nearly 3 million chickens.

The continued spread of the virus in Wisconsin could threaten birds in zoos, pet birds and the egg and poultry industry. Dane County's Vilas Zoo closed its bird exhibits on [22 Mar 2022] because of the outbreak.

On [Thu 31 Mar 2022], the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) said the strain has been found in several wild bird species across southern Wisconsin.

The virus does not pose a public health concern because the virus is not spreading to humans. Cooking poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 deg. [approx. 74 deg.C] F kills the virus, DATCP said.

What to watch for:
DATCP is encouraging residents to report signs of bird flu by calling during business hours or after hours and weekends. Signs of infected birds include:
- sudden death without clinical signs;
- lack of energy or appetite;
- decrease in egg production; soft, misshapen eggs;
- purple discoloration of wattles, comb, and legs;
- difficulty breathing;
- runny nose, coughing, sneezing;
- stumbling or falling down;
- diarrhea;
- tremors;
- circling movement;
- holding head in strange positions.

[Avian influenza continues its winged flight across North America. Most wild bird species, as well as poultry and other domestic birds, are neither tolerant nor resistant to HPAI viruses, and thus they become ill and do not move much, which implies they are poor spreaders and instead they may act as sentinels of viral circulation. Consequently, please be on alert for the least sign of a bird not feeling well or not eating. Early detection can help limit losses.

Biosecurity of your birds is paramount in keeping them healthy. Just as flu flies, it can also be tracked around on dirty boots or coveralls, and even carried in your own nose without affecting you. Please remember to blow your nose, and put on a clean coverall and boots before entering a poultry facility, regardless of size. If your operation is small enough or you have adequate facilities, move your birds indoors. Be on the lookout for wild birds mingling with your birds. If a bird is not eating, seems a little more listless, or separates itself from the others, then be sure to have your animals checked by a veterinarian immediately. Isolate sick birds. - Mod.TG
