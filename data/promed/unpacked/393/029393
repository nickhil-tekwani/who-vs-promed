The death toll linked to _Listeria_-contaminated cantaloupes in the
United States has climbed to 28, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention said on Tue Oct 25 2011.

Whole or pre-cut Rocky Ford-brand cantaloupe from Colorado-based
Jensen Farms have been traced as the cause of what has become the
deadliest U.S. food-borne listeriosis outbreak in a quarter century.

A total of 133 people in 26 states have fallen ill so far in the
outbreak, and the CDC has said that one woman, who was pregnant at the
time she fell ill, had a miscarriage.

The deadliest known food-borne listeriosis outbreak in the United
States was in 1985 when a Jalisco Products' Mexican-style soft cheese
contaminated with _Listeria_ killed 18 adults and 10 newborns and
caused 20 miscarriages.

The illness has a long incubation period, with symptoms sometimes not
showing up until 2 months after people consume _Listeria_-tainted
foods. In a warning letter to Jensen Farms on 18 Oct 2011, the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration said testing turned up widespread
_Listeria_ contamination at its Granada, Colorado packing plant, which
"indicates poor sanitary practices in the facility."

The elderly, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems
are most at risk of falling ill from listeriosis. Symptoms include
fever and muscle aches, sometimes preceded by diarrhea and other
gastric problems.

[Jensen Farms, where the _Listeria_-contaminated cantaloupe were
grown, has been variously located either in Holly, Colorado
(ProMED-mail post Listeriosis, fatal - USA (07): cantaloupe, more
cases & deaths 20110930.2950) or, according to the above news release,
in Granada, Colorado. Like Holly, Granada is also located in Prowers
County, Colorado. Granada is nearly 80 miles (145 km) to the east of
Rocky Ford, Colorado and is the site of a Japanese American internment
camp during World War II, south of US 50
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granada,_Colorado).

Initially cantaloupe from the Rocky Ford region of southeastern
Colorado was the suspected vehicle (ProMED-mail post Listeriosis,
fatal - USA (03) 20110914.2800). Subsequently, cantaloupe involved in
the listeriosis outbreak was traced specifically to cantaloupe from
Jensen Farm, which labeled its cantaloupe with the Rocky Ford name.
The FDA identified the recalled whole cantaloupes from Jensen Farm as
having a green and white sticker that reads: "Product of USA-Frontera
Produce-Colorado Fresh-Rocky Ford-Cantaloupe," or a gray, yellow, and
green sticker that reads "Jensen Farms-Sweet Rocky Fords"
(http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm271879.htm). Photos of the
labeling can be seen at
http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm271882.htm. Cantaloupe from
other farms in this region of southeastern Colorado have not been
implicated in this outbreak. - Mod.ML]
