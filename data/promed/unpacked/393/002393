Brazilian authorities say they've now confirmed 47 cases of yellow fever, and 25 deaths. The Health Ministry also says it's investigating more than 160 other suspected cases of the mosquito-borne disease.

The outbreak is centered in the east-central state of Minas Gerais, whose governor declared a 180-state of emergency this month after an initial report of 8 deaths.

The government says it's sent 2 million extra doses of vaccine against the disease to Minas Gerais. And it says hundreds of thousands of other doses will be sent there and to nearby Espirito Santo this week.

Last year [2016], Brazil registered just 7 confirmed yellow fever cases.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the disease can cause fever, chills, severe headache, pain, nausea and vomiting.

[Several recent reports indicated that monkeys' dead of yellow fever have been found in Minas Gerais. A comprehensive overview of yellow fever in the area must take these monkey deaths into consideration because they indicate that a sylvan (forest) cycle of YF virus is occurring. These reports indicate that the reported human YF cases represent spill-over of this sylvan cycle.

The relatively large number of human deaths in a short period of time makes one wonder if urban _Aedes aegypti_ transmitted YF virus transmission is also occurring. Initiation of the YF vaccination campaign is urgent.

It is curious that recent YF cases in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states are not mentioned in the above report.
