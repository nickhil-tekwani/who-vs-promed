EU Animal disease notification system (ADNS)
--------------------------------------------
According to the 27 Oct 2006 update of table 11 (animal disease
situation per country and per disease), the total number of
bluetongue outbreaks reported by European Union member states during
the period 1 Jan 2006 to 27 Oct 2006 was 1262, of which 1254 in the 4
affected north-west EU countries (the remaining 8 were
serologically-positive Bulgarian sentinel goats, detected on 11 Oct 2006).
The following (accumulated) number of outbreaks are reported from
each of the 4 aforementioned NW EU countries:
Country / No outbreaks (previous week's data)/last date of confirmation
Belgium / 460 (403)/ 26 Oct 2006
Germany / 472 (365) / 25 Oct 2006
France / 5 (5) / 13 Oct 2006
Netherlands / 317 (263) / 26 Oct 2006

[During the week 21-27 Oct 2006, 218 new confirmed BT outbreaks have
been reported in 3 of the 4 affected northwestern EU countries,
compared to 320 during the previous week. The disease, though still
spreading, seems to have peaked in Belgium, France and the
Netherlands, and possibly Germany too:
Country: No. outbreaks added week ending 13 Oct/20 Oct/27 Oct (ADNS data)
Belgium: 96/106/57
France: no data since 13 Oct
Netherlands: 60/57/54
Germany: 58/157/107
