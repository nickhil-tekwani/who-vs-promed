KOMSOMOLSK-ON-AMUR, June 24 (Itar-Tass) The Komsomolsk-on-Amur sanitary
service has had to close down the children's health-building camp on board
the cruise liner Georgy Sedov due to the outbreak of an acute intestinal
infection.
The liner, belonging to the Amur Shipbuilding Yard joint-stock company has
returned here. Thirty-two children have been placed at an infectious
disease hospital. Doctors suspect an enteroviral infection although "no
exact diagnosis has been established so far. Laboratory studies are under
way," a source in the Territorial sanitary and epidemiological service told
Itar-Tass on Wednesday.
The condition of the hospitalised children is satisfactory. The other
holiday-makers from the floating camp have been sent home to remain under
doctors' supervision.
According to information from the sanitary and epidemiological service
experts, Amur river water is unfit for drinking because a number of
viruses, including that of hepatitis-A strain, have been found in it.

[So it is not only elderly Caucasian tourists who are susceptible to GI
illness on board cruise liners.
Komsomolsk is on the Amur river, about halfway between Khabarovsk, on the
Chinese border, and the river's mouth north of Sakhalin Island in the Sea
of Okhotsk, north of Japan - Mod.JW
