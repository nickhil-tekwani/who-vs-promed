The Indiana Department of Correction [IDOC] announced that an outbreak of legionnaires' disease has been confirmed at the Pendleton Correctional Facility. 3 cases have been confirmed, and 2 additional cases have been identified to be probable.

Legionnaires' disease is a very serious type of pneumonia caused by bacteria called _Legionella_. Outbreaks are often associated with large or complex water systems, such as showers, fountains, and hot tubs.

"IDOC and the Indiana Department of Health are working to determine the source, and in the meantime have turned off the hot water and communicated with offenders and staff about the outbreak," said Annie Goeller, the Chief Communications Officer for the Indiana Department of Correction, in a news advisory. "Appropriate remediation will take place based on the results of testing that is underway. Protecting the incarcerated population and staff at the facility is the top priority."

All 5 incarcerated individuals are receiving treatment and are hospitalized. Others who show symptoms will be tested and treated in the same way as needed.

Legionnaires' disease is serious, with 1 in 10 people who get the disease dying from infection. It can be treated with antibiotics and can make a full recovery, especially if the individual is receiving care in a hospital.

"IDOC will take any necessary steps to protect the incarcerated population and staff from further exposure," Goeller said. "Toilets and drinking water are not affected since the bacteria is spread through water droplets that are inhaled."

[_Legionella_ are Gram-negative bacilli that are found in both natural freshwater environments, like lakes and streams, and in plumbing systems, such as showerheads and sink faucets, cooling towers, decorative fountains, hot tubs/spas, and hot water tanks and heaters. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 C (77-104 F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

Debilitated patients who are prone to aspiration may develop legionnaires' disease following aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water, as well as inhaling a fine spray (aerosols) from water sources containing _Legionella_. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356). _Legionella_ infection can be acquired less commonly by contamination of wounds.

Eradication of these bacteria from plumbing systems is often difficult. Long-term persistence within these water systems is favored by the intracellular location of _Legionella_ within several species of protozoa, where _Legionella_ replicate and which provide protection from environmental stressors, like biocides and heat treatment; the formation of biofilms allows adherence of _Legionella_ to the inner surfaces of the plumbing systems (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5835138/). _L. pneumophila_ have been shown to persist for long periods in biofilms in a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state after exposure to a biocide or heat treatment (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515819/). Monitoring _L. pneumophila_ in water systems usually done by culture would miss VBNC _Legionella_, which can be revived by the subsequent addition of ameba (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18839249).

Genotyping the clinical isolates will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak if the genotypes match. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping.

Pendleton (pop., 4253 in 2010) is a town in Fall Creek Township, Madison County, Indiana, located about 35 miles (56 km) northeast of Indianapolis, the Indiana state capital. United States (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendleton,_Indiana). The Pendleton Correctional Facility is located on the south edge of town. A map showing the location of Pendleton can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Pendleton,+IN,+USA/Indianapolis,+Indiana,+USA.

More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
