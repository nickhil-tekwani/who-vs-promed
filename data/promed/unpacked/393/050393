PRION DISEASE UPDATE 2007
**************************
A ProMED-mail post
<http://www.promedmail.org>
ProMED-mail is a program of the
International Society for Infectious Diseases
<http://www.isid.org>
[NOTE: With continuing decline of the number of cases of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease [abbreviated previously as vCJD or CJD (new
var.) in ProMED-mail] in the human population, it has been decided to
broaden the scope of the occasional ProMED-mail reports to included
other prion-related diseases. Therefore, this update becomes the 1st
Prion disease update, which supersedes and includes what would have
been "CJD (new var.) update 2007 (06)."
In the case of human cases of vCJD, the definitions of the
designations deaths, definite cases, probable vCJD cases, and the
case definitions can be found by accessing the Department of Health
website or by reference to a previous ProMED-mail post in this thread
(for example, ProMED-mail, CJD (new var.) - UK: update March 2002
20020305.3693).
Data on vCJD cases from any part of the world are now included in
these updates whenever available. Also, data on other forms of CJD
(sporadic, iatrogenic, familial, and GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease) are included also when they
have some relevance to the incidence and etiology of vCJD.
In addition, prion-related diseases of domesticated and free-living
animals may also be included if relevant. - Mod.CP]

Monthly Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease statistics - 8 May 2007
-----------------------------------------------
The Department of Health is today [Mon 8 May 2007] issuing the latest
information about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease. This includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
[abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD], the form of
the disease thought to be linked to BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy).
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK as of Tue 8 May 2007
-----------------------------------------------
Summary of vCJD cases -- deaths
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 112
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 46
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 2
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 160
Summary of vCJD cases -- alive
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 5
Total
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 165
(The next table will be published on 4 Jun 2007.)
Since the previous monthly statistics were released on Mon 2 Apr
2007, the total number of deaths from definite vCJD has increased by
one and is now 160. The number of probable vCJD cases still alive has
decreased by one. The overall total number of definite or probable
vCJD cases (dead and alive) remains 165.
These data are consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in the
UK is in decline. The peak number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000,
followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005,
5 in 2006, and so far 2 in 2007.
Totals for all types of CJD cases in the UK since 1995
---------------------------------------------
As of Mon 8 May 2007, in the UK in the year 2007, so far there have
been 34 referrals, 7 deaths from sporadic CJD, 2 deaths from
iatrogenic CJD, 2 deaths from vCJD, one from GSS and none from familial CJD.
During the period from 1995, when vCJD was 1st diagnosed, up to the
present, there have been 970 deaths from all forms of CJD including
the 160 deaths attributable to definite or probable vCJD. [These data

[2] UK: Advice to dentists on instrument use
Date: Fri 20 Apr 2007

<http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpr/news/default.htm#vcjd>

Advice for dentists on single-use of endodontic instruments for all
patients to reduce the risk of secondary transmission of vCJD
-----------------------------------------------
The Department of Health has received early findings from research in
progress by the Health Protection Agency (HPA), at the Centre for
Emergency Preparedness and Response. Results from studies in mice
have found transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) infectivity
in dental tissues. The research is ongoing, and further advice will
be sought from the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee
(SEAC) and other advisory groups. The results support the possibility
that dental files and reamers (most commonly used in root canal
treatment) could pose an effective route of transmission of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) infection.
The Chief Dental Officer for England (CDO) has written to all
dentists practicing in primary or secondary care, advising them to
restrict endodontic reamers and files to single use for all patients.
This is on a precautionary basis in order to reduce any risk of vCJD
transmission. He has also advised dentists to ensure that the highest
standards of decontamination are observed for all dental instruments
and that manufacturers' decontamination instructions are followed [1].
This new guidance from the CDO is an extra precaution resulting from
the recent research, and the public should be advised to continue to
attend their dentist for the treatment that they require.
Advice and guidance from the ACDP TSE Working Group regarding
dentistry for individuals with or at risk of vCJD remain, for the
present, unchanged [2,3].

Edmonton anti-diabetes islet transplants on hold
-----------------------------------------------
Concerns that brain-wasting prions could have infected patients being
treated for diabetes have put world-leading islet transplants being
done in Alberta on hold temporarily. Doctors say chances are remote
that recipients have been exposed to the prions that can cause the
human form of mad cow disease [vCJD], but they've stopped transplants
until a source for an enzyme used in the procedure can be found that
doesn't use cow brains.
We just decided to put the program on hold," said Dr. James Shapiro,
the surgeon who developed what has become known around the world as
the Edmonton Protocol. It has been used on more than 800 patients since 2000.
Shapiro and his team transplant healthy islet cells into the pancreas
of people with Type 1 diabetes. The healthy cells allow recipients to
again begin producing insulin crucial to the body's ability to
regulate sugar digestion.
The National Institutes of Health was creating a similar program in
the United States when it discovered that one of the biomedical
compounds that Shapiro's team has been using depends on cow brains.
Roche Applied Sciences was selling the team an enzyme that allows
doctors to extract healthy islet cells. But Roche was buying the
bacteria that secretes the enzyme from a third company, which grew
the bacteria using fat from cow brains.
Brains are one of the parts of the cow that concentrate prions, which
cause both mad cow disease and its human form, Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease. Mad cow disease is present in American cattle, although its
reported incidence is low.
Shapiro and his colleagues decided to put transplants on hold on 22
Mar 2007 while they sought more information about the risk. Although
several steps separate patients from the cow brain material, prions
are infectious and notoriously hard to kill. Experts at Health Canada
estimated the risk at between one in a million and one in 10 million;
"very low," Shapiro said. No evidence of infection has surfaced in
any transplant recipients.
Shapiro's team has located an enzyme manufacturer that doesn't use
cow brains. He suggested the transplants could resume soon, pending
approval by experts in both Canada and the U.S. "I'm hopeful we can
reactivate within days," said Shapiro, who added no operations were
delayed by the hiatus.
Roche spokeswoman Michele Beaubien said from Montreal that the enzyme
is sold for research purposes only. "When we sell it, we clearly
state it is only for research," she said. "This is where Dr.
Shapiro's responsibility comes in." She said Roche's catalogue states
the product is made using animal products, although it doesn't
specify brains. Shapiro said the issue may have gone undetected for
so long because the Edmonton doctors began using the Roche enzyme
before mad cow disease became a concern in North America. "People had
never heard of prion diseases at that time."

[4] USA: Chronic wasting disease, adaptation to rodents
Date: Sat 28 Apr 2007

<http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/81/8/4305>
[The following information is taken from the abstract of a paper
entitled "Transmission and Adaptation of Chronic Wasting Disease to
Hamsters and Transgenic Mice: Evidence for Strains," by Gregory J.
Raymond and 9 others, published in the April 2007 issue of the
Journal of Virology p. 4305-4314, Vol. 81, No. 8

Division of Wildlife, Wildlife Research Center, Fort Collins,
Colorado 80526-20974. - Mod.CP]

In vitro screening using the cell-free prion protein conversion
system [which assays sensitivity to proteinase K digestion] indicated
that certain rodents may be susceptible to chronic wasting disease
(CWD). Therefore, CWD isolates from mule deer, white-tailed deer, and
elk were inoculated intracerebrally into various rodent species to
assess the rodents' susceptibility and to develop new rodent models of CWD.
The species inoculated were Syrian golden, Djungarian, Chinese,
Siberian, and Armenian hamsters, transgenic mice expressing the
Syrian golden hamster prion protein, and RML Swiss and C57BL10 wild-type mice.
The transgenic mice and the Syrian golden, Chinese, Siberian, and
Armenian hamsters had limited susceptibility to certain of the CWD
inocula, as evidenced by incomplete attack rates and long incubation
periods. For serial passages of CWD isolates in Syrian golden
hamsters, incubation periods rapidly stabilized, with isolates having
either short (85 to 89 days) or long (408 to 544 days) mean
incubation periods and distinct neuropathological patterns. In
contrast, wild-type mouse strains and Djungarian hamsters were not
susceptible to CWD.
These results show that CWD can be transmitted and adapted to some
species of rodents and suggest that the cervid-derived CWD inocula
may have contained or diverged into at least 2 distinct transmissible
spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) strains.
These rodent-adapted CWD models may be useful in comparative studies
of TSE strains in vivo as well as for testing potential anti-TSE
therapeutic agents.
