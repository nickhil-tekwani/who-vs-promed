RE: Foot & mouth disease, bovine - South Korea: (KG), OIE
---------------------------------------------------------
Regarding the 2007 outbreak in DPR Korea ("North Korea"), this was
later shown to be caused by serotype Asia-1, as a result of samples
submitted under the FAO TCP project to the WRL, Pirbright, UK, and
not type O. The Asia-1 diagnosis was made on the basis of serology
(high titres to Asia-1 in sera from receovered animals) and virus
isolation. This was the most far easterly report of a case of FMDV Asia-1.

[Thanks to Dr Sumption for the retroactive update.

According to the Web site of the World Reference laboratory for foot
and mouth disease (FMD), Pirbright, UK, 2 batches of FMD samples were
received in 2007 from North Korea, as follows
[<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/asia/nkr.htm>]:

WRLFMD batch no./ Date Received/ Type/ Virus isolates/ Topotype /Strain
WRLFMD-2007-00011/ 30 Apr 2007/ O (footnote 1)/ NKR/1/2007/ ME-SA/ vaccine-like
WRLFMD-2007-00022/ 06 Jul 2007/ Asia 1/ NKR/2/2007/ - / -

Footnote 1: probably a laboratory contaminant.

According to the data presented during the 5th Annual Meeting of the
Network of OIE/FAO Reference Laboaratories for FMD, 23-27 Nov 2009,
Delhi, the recent (2009) situation in Eastern Asia is the following:

A small number of cases of serotype A and Asia 1 have been detected
in China this year [2009]. The Asia 1 viruses appear to be matched by
the current vaccine used in China, whilst the suitability of vaccines
to cover the serotype A viruses is still under study. In South East
Asian (SEA) countries, serotypes O and A have predominated with no
reports of Asia 1. Whereas all serotype A viruses in SEA appear to be
derived from the same lineage that has evolved within the region for
many years, the situation for serotype O is more complex with a
mixture of indigenous and introduced viruses. Samples have been
analysed at Pakchong from Myanmar, Laos, Viet Nam, Cambodia and
Thailand. The vaccines used in the different countries are as follows:

(1) China, O China 99, A China F/72, Asia 1 China JSWX052;
(2) Viet Nam, O Manisa and O 3039, A May 97 and A22 Iraq, Asia 1 Shamir;
(3) Malaysia, O Manisa and O 3039, A May 97, Asia 1 Shamir;
(4) Thailand, O 189/87 (Manisa-like), A 118/87, Asia 1/85 (Asia 1 Shamir-like).

There were considered to be no major gaps in submission, although the
number of samples analysed is quite small and there have been no
submissions this year to Pakchong from Malaysia. In 2010, the main
concern in China is over possible continuation of outbreaks caused by
serotype A, whilst outbreaks of both serotype O and A are expected to
recur in South East Asia. See at
