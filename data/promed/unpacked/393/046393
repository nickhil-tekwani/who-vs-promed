The recent report of salmonellosis related to imported Spanish
sausage once more highlights the international flavor of recent
outbreaks. The following chronology of some past episodes was
abstracted from GIDEON.

_Salmonella_ [enterica_ serotype] Eastborne infection was caused by
contaminated chocolate.
1995 - An outbreak (27 cases in the UK) of _S._ Agona infection was
caused by a snack imported from Israel.
1997 - An outbreak (242 cases, approximate) in the USA & Finland of
_S._ Stanley infection was traced to alfalfa sprouts.
1997 - An outbreak of _S._ Livingstone infection was reported in
Western Europe - several of the cases were acquired abroad, notably in Tunisia.
1998 - Outbreaks of _S._ Blockley infection were reported in Germany,
Austria, Belgium, Sweden, Finland and the UK - smoked eel implicated

reported among European tourists who visited Turkey during the summer of 1999.
2000 - Outbreaks of _S._ Typhimurium DT204b infection (total 396
cases) which may have been related occurred in Iceland, England and
Wales, the Netherlands, Scotland and Germany. Contaminated lettuce

30 infection (157 cases in Canada, 11 in the USA) was caused by

was associated with contaminated peanuts imported from China.
