[ProMED-mail would appreciate more information about these plague cases in
Ecuador, especially their exact location(s) and whether they were bubonic
or pneumonic.

Most of the world's cases of _Y. pestis_ infection occur in Africa and
Asia; the foci of plague in the Americas account for no more than 1.4
percent of world cases annually. These foci are located in the
southwestern USA, northern Peru, the Department of La Paz in Bolivia,
several areas in northeastern Brazil, and in the Chimborazo Province of
Ecuador (1).

Ecuador reported an estimated 160 cases from an outbreak in 1998 including
pneumonic cases (1, 2). In the 1960s, however, 200-350 cases per year were
reported from 1961 to 1966 (3).
