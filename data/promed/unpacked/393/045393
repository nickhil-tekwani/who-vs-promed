Teachers from the Faculty of Veterinary Sciences testified before the Public Ministry on Fri 20 Oct 2017. They reported that the authorities knew about the existence of a laboratory report, issued in September 2017, confirming a case of brucellosis. However, they were asked to remain silent. Prosecutor Julio [Ortiz] is investigating cases of brucellosis in the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of the National University of Asunción (UNA). This Fri 20 Oct 2017 he listened to testimony of 3 teachers who assigned full responsibility for the silence to the dean.

By fiscal order, 2 teachers, the head of the Caprine Division, and students of the Faculty of Veterinary Sciences declared before the judicial authorities and adjudged all responsibility to the dean, for having requested that the information not be revealed. [When the head of the Caprine Division found out about the 1st case of brucellosis on 28 Sep 2017], he approached the dean with concern, informed her of the case with the laboratory test, and the dean asked the doctor to keep quiet, saying that she and other authorities would take care of the problem and solve it," said the prosecutor of the case.

Facing this situation the dean decided to remain silent, according to [the teachers'] statements. A few weeks later they began to hear the rumors in the hall about cases of brucellosis. This caused 3 teachers to decide to face the dean, who evaded the situation, Ortiz reported to 970 AM [radio]. He added that the dean of the Faculty could be accused of marketing of harmful foods from sale of diseased goat's milk [as established in article 208 of the penal code regarding commercialization of harmful foods].

On Fri 20 Oct 2017, another possible case of brucellosis was confirmed, according to unofficial sources, while 29 people, including teachers and students of the Faculty of Veterinary Sciences, are suspected cases based on the symptoms they reported. The 3rd case is that of a teacher who received treatment at a private medical facility, where he was given the confirmation of brucellosis.

Hugo Idoyaga, president of Senacsa [National Service for Animal Health and Quality], said that the outbreak of brucellosis would have started in May 2017, according to the background of the case, and not a month ago, as pointed out by the authorities of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of the UNA. Idoyaga confirmed that they received a note from the Faculty on 15 Jun 2017, but it was a request for cooperation to supervise academic activities of students and not communicating about the outbreak.

The information on brucellosis in veterinary students of the National University of Asunción is true. It was related to contact with diseased goats that were already sacrificed. The scope of the event is being investigated. The case is being investigated not only by authorities of the Ministry of Health but also by the Public Prosecutor's Office, being judicialized to clarify the fact.

[ProMED thanks the EpiCore Global Surveillance Project member for this comment.

ProMED would like more information regarding the number of cases and what symptoms occurred. With the caprine source, _Brucella melitensis_ is the likely organism. It is unfortunate that the authorities at the school were apparently not forthcoming about the infection. That "power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely" is certainly a true adage. It is unfortunate that this event and bullying and other abuses of power may be in the graduate medical/veterinary worlds, like the current sexual abuse issues in the entertainment industry, another "dirty little secret". - Mod.LL
