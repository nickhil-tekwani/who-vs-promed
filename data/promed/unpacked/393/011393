Final Analysis of Netherlands Avian Influenza Outbreaks Reveals Much Higher
Levels of Transmission to Humans Than Previously Thought
---------------------------------------------------
Recent alerts demonstrate that the transmission of avian influenza to
humans, which re-emerged at the beginning of 2004, is far from over in
South East Asia (1). As efforts to control the epidemic and prevent further
human cases continue, the need to assess the effectiveness of current
control measures grows. An executive summary of the final report of the
outbreak of avian influenza A/H7N7 in the Netherlands has recently been
published in English (2).
Between March and May 2003, an unprecedented outbreak of avian influenza
occurred in humans in the Netherlands. During an extensive epizootic of
influenza A virus H7N7 on commercial poultry farms, 86 cases in poultry
workers and 3 cases in people with no poultry contact were initially
confirmed by PCR. The predominant symptom was conjunctivitis (3). One
veterinarian developed fatal respiratory distress syndrome after close
contact with infected poultry (4).
A questionnaire survey was carried out as a follow-up to the outbreak.
Approximately 400 poultry farmers and their families and almost 900 people
who were involved in controlling the epidemic participated in this
investigation. Blood samples were taken from 500 of these participants to
determine possible infection with the avian influenza virus. Additional
studies were performed for 62 household contacts of 25 persons with avian
influenza virus infection.
Routine serological tests failed to detect any antibodies, even in the
group of persons with confirmed avian influenza virus conjunctivitis. A
modification of the haemagglutination assay was developed, based on
observations that avian influenza viruses favour binding to red blood cells
from horses rather than turkeys (5). As at least 50 percent of the people
exposed to infected poultry had H7 antibodies detectable with the modified
assay, it was estimated that avian influenza A/H7N7 virus infection
occurred in at least 1000, and perhaps as many as 2000 people. The
seroprevalence of H7 antibodies in people without contact with infected
poultry, but with close household contact to an infected poultry worker,
was 59 percent. This suggests that the population at risk for avian
influenza was not limited to those with direct contact to infected poultry,
and that person-to-person transmission may have occurred on a large scale.
Specificity of the unconventional assay was confirmed by the absence of
reactivity in sera from 100 controls recently vaccinated with influenza
vaccine (2002/2003) (specificity 100 percent).
Assay specificity was further supported by the results of the cohort study:
having measurable antibodies was associated with having conjunctivitis (RR
1.72; 95 percent CI 0.99-2.99), and a lower proportion of the exposed
persons who took prophylactic antiviral medication developed antibodies
(corrected OR 0.48; 95 percent CI 0.25-0.89).
Neither poultry farmers nor those engaged in controlling the epidemic
complied satisfactorily with preventive measures. Only 6 percent of farmers
reported consistent use of facial masks and 1 percent reported consistent
use of goggles while working with infected poultry. In cullers, compliance
was only slightly better: 25 percent consistently used facial masks and 13
percent used goggles. The results of the epidemiological study suggest that
oseltamivir protected against conjunctivitis (corrected OR=0.14; 95 percent
CI=0.08-0.27) as well as against infection without specific symptoms. No
protective effect was demonstrable for safety goggles or mouth-nose masks (2).
After the outbreaks of group A subtype H5N1 (A/H5N1) avian influenza
viruses in Hong Kong in 1997, in which 6 people died, the hypothesis was
put forward that not only pigs but also humans themselves might serve as
mixing vessels for the next pandemic influenza virus (6). The outbreak of
avian influenza A/H7N7 in the Netherlands and the recent unprecedented
expansion of avian influenza A/H5N1 in Asia have reinforced this concern.
A review of the outbreak and control efforts in the Netherlands highlights
important lessons for preparedness: while separate systems are in place to
signal and control animal diseases and human diseases, an outbreak of a
zoonotic disease illustrates the importance of coordination between the 2.
In the Netherlands, the people infected came from a wide geographic region
and included foreign poultry workers. While the movement of animals was
restricted, these people were out of the reach of the public health
authorities while infectious and shedding the virus.
Although the disease in humans is more severe for A/H5N1, both avian
influenza outbreaks illustrate that crossing the species barrier is less
rare than previously recognised, that avian influenza virus adaptation
occurs rapidly, and that if such jumps between species occur, human
behaviour in the broad sense may accelerate dissemination (7).
