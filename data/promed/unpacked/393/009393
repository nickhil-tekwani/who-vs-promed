First Report of Cucumber leaf spot virus in Spain.
---------------------------------------------------
E. Segundo, D. Janssen, L. Velasco, L. Ruiz, and I. M. Cuadrado, CIFA "La
Mojonera," 04700 El Ejido, Almeria, Spain. Plant Dis. 85:1123, 2001;
published on-line as D-2001-0810-01N, 2001. Accepted for publication 24
July 2001.
Cucumber leaf spot virus (CLSV), reclassified as a species in the new genus
Aureusvirus (family Tombusviridae) (1), has ca. 30-nm isometric particles
with a ca. 4.4-kb positive-sense, [ss] RNA. [It]... is transmitted by the
chytrid fungus _Olpidium bornovanus_(Ob). The virus has been reported in
Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia.
During the fall of 2000, abundant chlorotic spots with necrotic centers
were observed on the leaves of cucumber plants grown in a commercial
greenhouse in Granada (southeastern Spain). [Mechanical inoculation of
cucumber with sap from symptomatic leaves induced symptoms suggestive of CLSV].
Based on the nucleic acid sequence of CSLV (2), the following specific
primers were designed: CLSVU1440 (5'-AAGGTAGGGGAGATCTTG-3') and CLSVA2160
(5'-CTTCGGCTGATTCTGA-3'). When used in ... RT-PCR, leaves expressing
symptoms yielded amplification products of the expected size (720 bp).
These products were cloned into a pGEM-T vector and sequenced (GenBank
Accession No. AY038365). The similarity of the nucleic acid and derived
amino acid sequences with the one published for CLSV (2) was 94.5 and
99.1%, respectively. The amino acid sequence was 86% identical to that of
Pothos latent virus (GenBank Accession No. AJ243370).
10 cucumber plants grown in vermiculite supplemented with rhizosphere soil
(1/30, vol/wt) from infected plants developed symptoms on leaves after 1
month and were positive for CLSV when leaf and root tissues were analyzed
by RT-PCR and Southern blot hybridization. Plants grown in vermiculite
alone [were] ... not infected. Microscopic examination of root tissue
revealed Ob ...only in infected plants.
To our knowledge, this is the first record of CSLV in Spain.

[CLSV, also known previously as Cucumber fruit streak virus, was first
reported to infect cucumber in Germany in 1982. The virus is soilborne, and
cucumber appears to be its only natural host. However it can be
mechanically inoculated to several other cucurbits as well as spinach. I
could not find any details on crop losses. Do any of our readers have
knowledge of this disease?
The VIDE description of the virus can be obtained at the following web site:
