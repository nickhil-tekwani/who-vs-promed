Up to 3000 cattle and pigs have contracted foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in
9 provinces across Vietnam and the epidemic appears to be expanding
further, animal health authorities said.
The Animal Health Department under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development said it had discovered 1060 buffalos and cows, 191 goats and
1721 pigs with the disease in Cao Bang, Tuyen Quang, Yen Bai, Thai Nguyen,
Phu Tho in the north; Can Tho, Soc Trang, Dong Nai in the south; and in
central highland Kon Tum province.
Minister Cao Duc Phat Tuesday [30 Jan 2007] instructed provinces to
restrict the pandemic by isolating diseased livestock, sterilization and
vaccinating healthy animals.
The leader also called for tight inspection to prevent the transportation
of the infected animals to other areas.

[In the absence of an official report since May 2006, the FMD situation in
Viet Nam remains unclear. This refers both to its geography as well as to
its epidemiology, including the identity (serotypes) of the circulating
virus. - Mod.AS]
