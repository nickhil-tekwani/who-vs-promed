Snake fungal disease (SFD) is an emerging disease in certain populations of wild snakes in the eastern and midwestern United States. While fungal infections were occasionally reported in wild snakes prior to 2006, recently the number of free-ranging snakes with fungal dermatitis submitted to the USGS National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC) and other diagnostic laboratories has been increasing. Laboratory analyses have demonstrated that the fungus _Chrysosporium ophiodiicola_ is consistently associated with SFD, but often, additional fungi are isolated from affected snakes. At this time, definitive evidence that _C. ophiodiicola_ causes SFD is inconclusive. As its name implies, SFD is only known to afflict snakes.

Several agencies, organizations, researchers, and other key stakeholders, including the NWHC, are working together to investigate this potentially emerging disease and to learn more about the impacts that SFD is having on snake populations in the eastern and midwestern United States. We encourage conservation agencies and natural resource managers to contact the NWHC if snakes with clinical signs consistent with SFD are encountered.

[While this article encourages caution regarding the causative organism, in 2009 isolation and characterization of _Chrysosporium ophiodiicola_ from a mycotic granuloma of a black rat snake (_Elaphe obsoleta obsoleta_) were reported. Analysis of the sequences of different fragments of the ribosomal genes demonstrated this species belongs to the order Onygenales and that it is genetically different from other morphologically similar species of _Chrysosporium_. This new species is unique in having both narrow and cylindrical-to-slightly clavate conidia and a strong, pungent odor.

Because it was reported in 2009, and now reported from a government organization that has likely been tracking occurrences, it may be a reasonable assumption that snake fungal disease has spread significantly and that what was reported in 2009 is not an isolated event.
