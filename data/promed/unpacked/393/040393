UNDIAGNOSED DIE-OFF, FISH - CHINA: (FUJIAN) REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

There is a report [from VietFish at
<http://vietfish.com/En/detail.php?id=9&&actitle=1852>] that white
spot virus has been found in finfish in China. Given that this virus
has only been found in crustaceans up to now, I am extremely surprised
by this news. Could you please tell me if this information is accurate?

[We share Dr Nerette's surprise and query. The newswire in
"Vietfish.com," dated 13 Jul 2009, reports, inter alia, that "The
white spot virus is to blame for killing 4000 metric tons of farmed
yellow croaker worth USD 100 million (EUR 72 million) in China's
aquaculture-rich Fujian province, according to the Chinese Fishery
Association (CFA)."

According to chapter 2.3.2 of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests for
Aquatic animals, the host species susceptible to "white spot disease"
(WSD), which is caused by the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), are
"all decapod (order Decapoda) crustaceans from marine and brackish or
freshwater sources." For further details, see
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/fmanual/A_00049.htm>.

Could the described, apparently (but in need of verification) huge
losses be attributed, in fact, to the iridovirus disease which --
reportedly -- affected farmed yellow croaker in Fujian province in
recent years? (see reference below).

Information and/or clarification from knowledgeable sources will be welcomed.
