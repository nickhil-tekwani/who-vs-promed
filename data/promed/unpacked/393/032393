Chronic wasting disease (CWD) has been found in a moose, or European elk (_Alces alces_), for the 1st time ever in Finland.

The disease was diagnosed in Kuhmo in a 15-year old moose, having died naturally. The results of the analyses carried out by Finnish Food Safety Authority Evira have been verified by an EU reference laboratory. Species of the deer family, known as "cervids," can suffer from chronic wasting disease, and it is always fatal. The disease is not known to have been contracted by people.

Norway was, before this case, the only European country where CWD has been diagnosed. The monitoring of the occurrence of the disease was intensified from the beginning of 2018 in Finland and 5 other EU Member States.

In Finland, the occurrence of the disease has been studied already since 2003. None of the approximately 2500 samples analyzed so far had tested positive for the disease. The monitoring of the disease will now be further intensified in the Kuhmo and Kainuu region. Hunters are going to be provided with more instructions before the start of the next hunting season, if appropriate.

Chronic wasting disease is not known to have been contracted by people. Moose meat is safe to eat, and no restrictions are imposed on the sale and exportation of meat of animals of the deer family. As a precautionary measure, the export of live animals of the deer family to other countries will be discontinued for now.

CWD is a slowly progressing disease of deer, elk, reindeer, and moose that always leads to death. Chronic wasting disease is a prion disease and related to BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) and other TSE diseases (transmissible spongiform encephalopathy). The disease is common in North America. The moose found in Kuhmo did not suffer from the North American, transmissible form of chronic wasting disease but from the form diagnosed in Norway, which is found incidentally in individual animals of the deer family.
