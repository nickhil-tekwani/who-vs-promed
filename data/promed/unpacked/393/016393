The California Department of Public Health says at least one Yosemite Park worker who gave blood in October [2012] tested positive for antibodies to the deadly hantavirus [Sin Nombre].

The virus killed 3 Yosemite visitors and sickened 6 more last summer. No park workers were among that total.

Public health officials say that the worker or workers who tested positive were less than one percent of the 569 employees who gave blood as part of the study.

The majority of those who were tested work for the National Park Service.

The department's full report on the outbreak is expected this spring or early summer.

[Finding one employee who had antibodies to Sin Nombre virus is not surprising, nor is it surprising that more antibody positive individuals were not found. In a previous study of mammalogists and others who had a history of contact with wild rodents in North America, few were found with hantavirus antibodies.

The abstract of that report reads, "Rodents are the principal hosts of Sin Nombre virus, 4 other hantaviruses known to cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in North America, and the 3 North American arenaviruses. Serum samples from 757 persons who had worked with rodents in North America and handled neotomine or sigmodontine rodents were tested for antibodies against Sin Nombre virus, Whitewater Arroyo virus, Guanarito virus, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Antibodies against Sin Nombre virus were found in 4 persons, against Whitewater Arroyo virus or Guanarito virus in 2 persons, and against lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus in none. These results suggest that risk for infection with hantaviruses or arenaviruses usually is low in persons whose occupations entail close physical contact with neotomine or sigmodontine rodents in North America."
