[In Karachi], 2 more patients tested positive for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF). They were admitted in hospitals for treatment and were said to be in critical condition.

A child aged 9 had been admitted in Aga Khan University Hospital with high fever. He had been diagnosed with CCHF and was being provided the required treatment. Karachi Health Director Dr Zafar Aijaz said another patient identified, aged 20, resident of Tauheedabad area in Landhi had also been diagnosed with CCHF and was being treated.

CCHF is a tick-borne viral disease, which can afflict domestic and wild animals and may also affect humans. The disease got its name after it was first described in Crimea in 1944 and later found in Congo, caused by the same pathogen.

Health experts feared an outbreak of the deadly infection in Pakistan when sacrificial animals were being brought to town from far-flung areas of the country without any precautions ahead of Eid-ul-Azha [or Eid al-Adha, Muslim Festival of Sacrifice].

A 24-year-old man who worked in a butcher's shop in Azizabad [neighbourhood of Gulberg Town in Karachi] had died of CCHF on [22 Aug 2014], the 1st case of CCHF in Sindh this year. The man was admitted to a private hospital with high fever, shortness of breath and internal bleeding 2 days before he was pronounced dead by doctors.

Experts say that in some rare cases across the world the disease has been reported to have spread from human to human.

The city reported a single CCHF case last year [2013] and 5 cases, including 4 shepherds who had shifted to Karachi from Balochistan, in 2012.

The disease was first reported in Pakistan in 1976. The number of cases showed a dramatic rise after 2000 with 50 to 60 patients being reported annually. Nearly 50 cases of the disease have so far been reported from different parts of the country this year [2014]. However, authorities have taken no precautionary measures to avoid a possible spike of CCHF.

[The sporadic cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in various parts of Pakistan are continuing this year (2014). CCHF virus is a tickborne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_.

The individuals described above may have acquired the infection via a tick bite or exposure to the blood of an infected animal. The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities also occurs [where infection control procedures are faulty. - Mod.JW]. The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.
