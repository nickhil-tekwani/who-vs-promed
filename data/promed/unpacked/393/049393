Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Iran 8 May 2015
----------------------------------
On 1 May 2015, the National IHR Focal Point for the Islamic Republic of Iran notified WHO of one additional case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.

Details of the case are as follows:
A 61-year-old male from Kahnooj city developed symptoms on [18 Mar 2015] and was admitted to hospital in Kahnooj city on [26 Mar 2015]. The patient was transferred to another hospital in Kerman city on [28 Mar 2015]. He has no comorbidities. On [13 Mar 2015], the patient had contact with 2 individuals with influenza-like illness (ILI) who returned from Umrah on [10 Mar 2015]. He has no history of contact with other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to onset of symptoms. The patient was discharged from hospital on [27 Apr 2015].

Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for this case. Also, investigation of the 2 ILI cases is ongoing. The 2 ILI cases have no history of exposure to any of the known risk factors while performing Umrah.

Globally, WHO has been notified of 1112 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 422 related deaths.

[The story of possible exposures to 2 individuals with ILI's (influenza-like) illness returning from Umrah (non-Hajj related pilgrimage to the holy sites in Saudi Arabia) is very much a deja vu from the story surrounding the 1st reported cases of MERS-CoV infection confirmed in Iran in 2014, where the presumed index case had a history of exposure to an individual with an ILI recently returned from Umrah (see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (80): S Arabia, Iran, Algeria, Tunisia 20140612.2534478 and MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (70): Iran, Saudi Arabia, UAE, RFI 20140527.2501383 for more details). It will be interesting to learn of results of serologic testing of the individuals to identify whether they have evidence of recent MERS-CoV infection or, if not, further investigations into other possible sources of MERS-CoV infection in Iran. Of note, the cases reported in 2014 were from Kerman province, and Kahnooj city is the capital of Kahnooj county in Kerman province in Iran.

More information on the results of further investigations would be greatly appreciated.

A map of Iran showing provinces can be found at http://www.emapsworld.com/iran-provinces-map.html. Kerman province is located in the southeastern part of the country.

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Saudi Arabia 8 May 2015
---------------------------
On 1 May 2015, the National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia notified WHO of one additional case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.

Details of the case are as follows:
A 35-year-old male from Khamis Mushait city developed symptoms on [27 Apr 2015] and was admitted to hospital on [29 Apr 2015]. The patient has comorbidities. He has no history of direct contact with camels or consumption of raw camel products; however, his house is adjacent to a camel market. The patient has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Currently, he is in critical condition in ICU. Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for this case.

Globally, WHO has been notified of 1111 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 422 related deaths.

[The above mentioned newly reported case in Saudi Arabia was reported by the MOH on 1 May 2015. Khamis Mushait (Khamis Mushayet) is located in Asir province in the southwest of the country and can be seen on the map of the original Saudi MOH report (http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/Statistics-2015-05-01-001.aspx).

A collateral sign that the MERS-CoV activity in Saudi Arabia and on the Arabian Peninsula has markedly decreased is the observation that the most recent ECDC Communicable Disease Threats weekly report for week 19 does not list MERS-CoV as a disease that is being followed.

The global tally of cases reported to and confirmed by WHO is now 1112, including 422 deaths (case fatality rate 37.9 percent). This does not include 2 additional cases and one death reported since 1 May 2015.
