A deadly neurological disease has been confirmed in a Michigan deer. A free-ranging deer tested positive for Chronic Wasting Disease, which is the 1st-ever confirmed case in Michigan.

The Department of Natural Resources says the deer was in Meridian Township in Ingham County.

While this is the 1st time a free-range deer has been confirmed with the disease, people might remember a 2008 case that was found in a penned deer, which created a 3-year baiting ban in our area. [baiting is the practice of placing deer feed near a hunting blind to lure the animals as close as possible]

The DNR and area business owners hope this isn't history repeating itself.

"Since it is mid-summer and it's not deer season at this time, we're going to attempt to test as many deer in that location as possible," says Katie Keen, from the Department of Natural Resources in Cadillac.

For now the DNR will focus efforts on testing deer in and around Ingham County. There's no immediate concern in Northern Michigan.

"If we do end up finding additional deer for every location that circle of surveillance will get bigger or might change location. So things could change," says Keen.

Chronic Wasting Disease is spread through body fluids and is highly contagious among deer, elk and moose. Deer begin to look frail and lose their fear of humans once infected.

"If someone feels that they see something that looks irregular, if you see a deer that's acting abnormal or is very thin regardless of where you are in Michigan, we would like to know about it," says Keen.

For now it's a waiting game to see if the disease moves north, but businesses like Northwoods Feed and Supply in Cadillac can't help but think back to the last time this happened.

"It definitely hit us pretty hard along with a lot of other stores in Northern Michigan. It's kind of concerning that it's a wild deer and not a penned deer like it was last time," says Jerry Horvath.

The DNR says as long as there's no cases in our area there's no need to start another baiting ban. Horvath is keeping his fingers crossed.

"Statewide that's a pretty big chunk, the deer hunting business. [It's big for] all businesses up here really and just the tourism it brings in too, so it could be a pretty bad deal if it does spread," says Horvath.

An immediate baiting ban will take place this fall [2015] just in the Ingham County area, as long as more cases aren't confirmed elsewhere.

Michigan's Department of Natural Resources says a white-tailed deer has tested positive for a deadly disease. The department says the deer carrying the state's 1st case of chronic wasting disease was found in Meridian Township in Ingham County.

Chronic wasting disease is a fatal brain disease that affects white-tailed deer, mule deer, elk and moose.

This is the 1st time the disease has been found in Michigan's free-ranging deer population.

In 2008, a white-tailed deer tested positive for the disease at a Kent County breeding farm. That's when the state immediately banned baiting of wild deer and issued a quarantine for private deer farms.

The DNR says the disease has been detected in 23 states.

There is no evidence that it is a risk to any humans.

[With all of the positive deer we have had in Michigan lately, it is most amazing this is the 1st free-ranging animal that has been confirmed to have the disease. As such, it is likely that we may see more reports in free-range deer. While it may have been in free-range deer for some time, it is the 1st diagnosed. The DNR will test as many free-range deer as possible, in other words, kill them to test them. It is understandable that they want to know the extent of the disease, but it might be better to wait until hunting season and then do the testing.
