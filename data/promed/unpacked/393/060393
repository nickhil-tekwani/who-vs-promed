Filipino tests positive for Ebola, experts worried
--------------------------------------------------
At least one person has tested positive for the Ebola-Reston virus in
the Philippines, where the disease has broken out in pigs at 2 farms
north of the capital, the government said on Friday [23 Jan 2009].

Health Secretary Francisco Duque told a news conference that there
was little immediate health risk but experts warned the virus's jump
to humans was a concern. "This presents a negligible risk to human
health," Duque said.

Experts from the World Health Organisation (WHO), World Organisation
for Animal Health (OIE), and the Food and Agriculture Organisation
(FAO), all UN agencies, ended a 10-day field test at the 2 farms over
the weekend after Ebola-Reston was found there last year [2008]. It
is the 1st time the virus has been found outside monkeys and the 1st
time it has been found in pigs. The virus had previously jumped from
monkeys to humans but it is the 1st case of a jump from hogs.

Duque said at least 50 workers in the 2 farms were exposed to the
virus, but only one person tested positive. This person had not shown
any symptoms, he said.

Experts said the jump was a concern even if the Ebola-Reston strain
of the virus is not as deadly as other strains of the [virus], which
can cause incurable haemmorrhagic fever and have a mortality rate of
25 to 90 percent. "Viruses jumping across species is always
worrying," said Lo Wing-lok, an infectious diseases expert in Hong
Kong. "If it continues to do so, the virus will adapt to the human
body or may mutate to become more transmissible among humans."

Although human cases of Ebola Reston in the past have been mild, Lo
warned against any complacency. "We can't say for sure that it is not
dangerous to man, we have to follow developments very closely," Lo
said. "In the past, the infections happened to a very small number of
people. But this virus may get magnified in swine and we could get a
higher-density virus in the environment and more cases of human
infection can occur," he said.

Q+A: Should the outbreak of Ebola in Philippines be a concern?
--------------------------------------------------------------
A Filipino farm worker has been found infected by the Ebola-Reston
virus that was discovered in pigs at 2 farms north of Manila last
year [2008]. It was the 1st time Ebola-Reston was found outside
monkeys, but the government said the health risk was negligible. The
infected man had not shown any symptoms and was healthy, officials said.

Here are some questions and answers on the disease
What is the Ebola Reston virus?
- There are 5 distinct species of the Ebola virus: Zare, Sudan, Cote
d'Ivoire, Bundibugyo, and Reston. The Zare, Sudan, and Bundibugyo
species have been associated with large Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF)
outbreaks in Africa with high mortality rates of between 25 percent
and 90 percent while Cote d'Ivoire and Reston have not.

How is Ebola-Reston different from the Ebola virus that was
responsible for many deaths in Africa?
- The Reston species can infect humans but no serious illness or
death in humans have been reported to date. During outbreaks of the
Reston strain in monkeys in the 1990s, a small number of people
(around 25) were found to have antibodies against Ebola Reston. This
means they had been infected by the virus and their body had produced
an immune response. However, only one person had mild, flu-like
symptoms. This person fully recovered. The other people who tested
positive for antibodies did not have any symptoms or illness.

What's different this time?
- This is the 1st time that Ebola-Reston has been found in pigs and a
pig farm worker has tested positive for Ebola Reston antibodies,
which means that the worker was probably infected by a pig, although
there is no proof of this. Pigs are worrisome because they are mixing
vessels for many types of viruses and bacteria and if left
uncontrolled, experts fear Ebola-Reston could mutate into a form that
is more transmissible among people.

Who and what are at risk?
- Unlike monkeys, pigs are farmed for food and far more people are
exposed to them, which puts them at risk of getting infected if the
epidemic in pigs is not under control.

What precautions can be taken?
- Basic good hygiene practices and food handling measures. Ebola
viruses are normally transmitted via contact with the blood or other
bodily fluids of an infected animal or person. In all situations,
even in the absence of identified risks, meat handling and
preparation should be done in a clean environment (table top,
utensils, knives) and meat handlers should follow good personal
hygiene practices (such as, clean hands, clean protective clothing).
In general, hands should be regularly washed while handling raw meat.

Pork from healthy pigs is safe to eat as long as either the fresh
meat is cooked properly (that is, 70 deg C [158 deg F] in all part of
the food, so that there is no pink meat and the juices run clear),
or, in the case of uncooked processed pork, national safety standards
have been met during production, processing, and distribution. Meat
from sick pigs or pigs found dead should not be eaten and should not
enter the food chain or be given to other animals. (Sources: FAO and WHO)

[One out of some 50 farm workers employed on 2 farms, which had
experienced outbreaks of Ebola-Reston disease in pigs, has tested
positive for Ebola-Reston virus antibodies. The farm worker exhibited
no symptoms of virus infection, and presumably no virus was isolated.
At present there appears to be little risk to human health associated
with the presence of Ebola-Reston virus in farmed animals, but the
replication of the virus in a few susceptible people may allow the
virus to evolve into a form capable of transmissible among humans.
Continued surveillance should be a priority. - Mod.CP
