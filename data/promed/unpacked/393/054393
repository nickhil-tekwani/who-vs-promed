WEST NILE VIRUS UPDATE 2002 - USA (07)

[Note: Now that West Nile virus infection is endemic throughout much of the
Eastern seaboard of the United States (see: West Nile virus - USA 2001:
final report 20020613.4491), most reports on West Nile virus infection in
year 2002 will be combined and presented as an "update" at regular, but not
more frequent than weekly, intervals determined by the volume of such
reports. As previously, however, reports of human infection, infection of
new hosts, extension of geographical range and events of special
significance will be posted immediately on receipt.
As of Fri 7 Jun 2002, the USGS/CINDI West Nile virus National and State Maps
(<http://cindi.usgs.gov/hazard/event/west_nile/west_nile.html>) displayed
the following West Nile virus-positive test results:
Horses 10 (Florida 7, Louisiana 3). Number unchanged since previous week.
Birds 56 (Washington, D.C. 1, Florida 4, Illinois 6, Louisiana 11, Michigan
1, Massachusetts 4, New Jersey 6, Ohio 10, Pennsylvania 1, Virginia 3 and
New York 9). This represents an increase of 23 West Nile virus-positive
birds over the previous total displayed on 31 May 2002.
As of Fri 7 Jun 2002, West Nile virus-positive birds have been found in the
District of Columbia and 12 states; the above 10 plus Connecticut and
Georgia. In addition one confirmed West Nile virus-positive bird has been
recorded in Canada (Ontario). - Mod.CP]

West Nile virus-infected Birds Detected in 6 Ohio Counties
----------------------------------------------------------
COLUMBUS: Seven dead crows and one blue jay in 6 Ohio counties have tested
positive for West Nile virus (WNV), the Ohio Department of Health (ODH)
announced on Thu 30 May 2002. No human or horse cases have been found in the
state. Two crows in Lake County and 2 in Cuyahoga County tested positive for
WNV. One crow each in Franklin, Mahoning, and Morrow counties and one blue
jay from Ottawa County tested positive for the virus.
WNV was first detected in Ohio in August 2001 in a Lake County blue jay. By
the end of summer, the virus had been detected in 54 blue jays and 226 crows
around the state. The virus probably remained in Ohio's mosquito population
throughout the winter, said J. Nick Baird, M.D., ODH Director. This spring,
ODH has tested 74 crows and blue jays for the virus; 66 were negative. "This
is no surprise. Finding evidence of West Nile virus in the spring is
consistent with our expectations," Baird said. "It should, however, serve as
reminder to Ohioans that the virus is here and they should take the
necessary precautions." It's likely the virus is in all 88 Ohio counties,
but has not yet been detected in the other 82, said Dr. Richard Berry, chair
of Ohio's WNV Workgroup and chief of ODH's Vector-born Disease Program.
Ohio is one of a dozen states and the District of Columbia to detect WNV in
2002. The other states are Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois,
Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and
Virginia. WNV has been detected only in birds and horses; no human cases or
positive mosquito pools have been reported in any of these states, Berry said.

New York: Two Crows in Nassau Test Positive for West Nile Virus
---------------------------------------------------------------
Two dead crows found in Nassau County have tested positive for West Nile
virus, the first of the year. But the finding poses no great threat to
humans, according to Nassau health officials. "We believe that the risk of
infection was low and remains low," said Cynthia Brown, spokeswoman for the
Nassau County Department of Health. She said Nassau has no plans to spray
for adult mosquitoes at this time.
Brown said one bird was found in Woodbury on 27 May 2002 and the other in
Plainview on 28 May 28 2002. She said mosquito traps in the two areas -- the
[virus] is normally spread by mosquitoes -- showed no infected insects. The
2 infected birds were the first on Long Island this year; Suffolk health
officials have not found any yet.
About 50 infected dead birds were found in Nassau County last season, the
vast majority of them crows, Brown said. She added that West Nile virus has
affected the crow population nationwide, so there is no guarantee that the
birds contracted the disease here.

Michigan: Change in Bird surveillance Practice
----------------------------------------------
Currently, the State of Michigan only plans to accept dead crows for West
Nile virus detection until a county has one positive crow. After a county
has a positive bird, no other samples will be accepted for West Nile virus
analysis.
Thus the State will not report more the one positive bird per county. This
may create the illusion that West Nile virus is less prevalent in Michigan
compared to surrounding states. I hope in the future this changes!
