I have only seen a few of the postings about the recent hantavirus cases in
South America, but have been struck by the number of pediatric cases. My
understanding of HPS [Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome was that it has been
quite rare to see pediatric cases. No one seems to have a good handle on
why. Perhaps there are people more knowledgeable about the epidemiology or
pathophysiology of the current South American cases or with the Sin Nombre
epidemic that have more insight into this and can confirm/deny the change
in epidemiology with the current outbreak?
[I am unaware of the data with regard to age distribution of HPS cases in
South America. In 1996 ProMED-mail carried a brief discussion of the fact
that there have been only one or two HPS cases in young people in the US.
If anyone with data regarding the age distribution of HPS cases in South
America and the possible reasons therefore, and would care to comment, we
would be grateful. -- Mod CHC
