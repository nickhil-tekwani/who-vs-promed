The Antique Provincial Health Office [PHO] reported the latest count of 1102 cases of chikungunya [virus infections].

Irene Dulduco, Information Officer of PHO, urged Antiquenos to sustain the cleanup drive and advocacy campaign against chikungunya. "Deadly mosquitoes carrying chikungunya virus can spread any time. Weather conditions can cause them to thrive in our homes and surroundings," explained Dulduco.

Intermittent rains and sunny weather is conducive for _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_ ([chikungunya virus] mosquito [vectors]) to multiply. Cleaning up indoors and in community places should [happen on a] regular basis, she said.

The PHO report revealed that cases were high for chikungunya [virus infections] in the last week of May to July [2013] with more than 900 persons affected with chikungunya virus.

Dulduco said they expect that the cleanup drive in schools will also be intensified.

[There have been several reports of outbreaks of chikungunya virus in various parts of the Philippines this year (2013), among them several reports of mixed chikungunya-dengue outbreaks, including in the complete report above (see the source URL). This is not surprising, since _Aedes aegypti_ is the mosquito vector of both viruses. One can expect these outbreaks to continue as long as the mosquito population is abundant. Unless vector control measures are quickly implemented, this outbreak is likely to continue to grow. There is no commercially available vaccine to prevent chikungunya virus infections, so the only effective measure to prevent transmission of the virus is through timely control of mosquito vectors.
