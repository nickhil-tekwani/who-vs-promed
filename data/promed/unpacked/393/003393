South Korea free of new foot and mouth disease but man arrested
----------------------------------------------
SEOUL: South Korea's outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) took an
unexpected turn on Wed 22 May 2002 when police arrested a farm owner and
officials said they would disinfect slaughter pits because bloody water had
leaked out.
The Agriculture Ministry said that authorities had now culled more than 110
000 animals to try to contain the disease, just 9 days ahead of the
Association Football World Cup finals being co-hosted by South Korea and
Japan from 31 May to 30 Jun 2002. "We have no more fresh reports of
suspected foot and mouth," a ministry official told Reuters by telephone.
FMD is contagious and can be fatal to animals with cloven hooves. It is
harmless to humans, but countries fear their football fans could
inadvertently bring the disease home.
Police said on Wed 22 May 2002 that they had arrested the owner of the
first farm to be infected. The farm owner is suspected of burying more than
200 dead pigs near his farm between 27 Apr and 2 May 2002 without alerting
authorities, said a statement from the Kyonggi provincial police agency.
"From 27 Apr, around 10 pigs at the farm started to die," the statement
said. "First, he buried dead pigs in a vacant lot in an attempt to hide the
existence of an infectious disease." It was not immediately clear how the
case came to light, nor how so many carcasses could be concealed in such a
densely populated country as South Korea.
South Korea confirmed four new cases of the disease in pigs between Sun 19
May and Mon 20 May 2002, bringing to 12 the total since the outbreak
started on 4 May 2002 and casting a shadow over World Cup preparations
already dogged by sluggish ticket sales and union strike threats.
"The current foot and mouth situation is under government control,"
Agriculture Minister Kim Dong-tae told reporters on Tue 21 May, adding that
the outbreak would not disrupt matches. Kim differentiated between South
Korea's outbreak and the case of Britain last year, which led to the
slaughter of four million animals and struck a blow to economic growth,
because South Korea had only seen cases in a limited area.
Of the total positive cases, 10 are located in a 12 mile diameter zone
between Yong-In and Ansong cities in Kyonggi province around Seoul. The
remaining 2 cases are just outside the town of Chinchon in Chung Chong
province. The affected areas are 40 to 55 miles south of Seoul.
European governments have warned football fans travelling to South Korea to
leave all food behind when they return home to prevent bringing the disease
back. The nearest World Cup stadium to the outbreak is Suwon, more than 24
miles west of infected farms but outside a controlled zone where movement
of people and livestock has been restricted.
South Korea is struggling to stop bloody water leaking from some of the
pits where culled animals were buried. "While we were pouring a large
number of dead pigs into a pit, those bodies tore a vinyl wrapper in the
pit," a government official told Reuters by telephone. "We are disinfecting
bloody water that leaked from those pits and deodorizing the areas."
South Korea plans to kill and bury 16 286 more animals, taking the total to
almost 127 000. That is more than 60 times the number culled in an outbreak
of FMD in 2000. The country has almost 9 million pigs and almost 2 million
cows.

Sir Geoff backs foot and mouth disease warning to World Cup fans
----------------------------------------------------------------
World Cup hat trick hero Sir Geoff Hurst today kicked off a campaign to
warn football fans against bringing back fresh meat bought during the
coming tournament in Korea and Japan.
Launching the Government's campaign, Food and Farming Minister Lord Whitty
said the highest risk from fresh meat was in Korea, where there had been a
recent outbreak of FMD. Britain was anxious to prevent any repetition of
last year's disaster when the disease ravaged farming and the countryside.
Lord Whitty said: "The highest risk is food from South Korea. There are
controls in place and meat products should not be brought back." He said
that any illegal meat, even if partly eaten, could get back into the food
chain. There would be stringent airport checks awaiting fans returning from
Korea, he warned.

[Just 3 to 4 days after the detection of new cases, the end of the South
Korean outbreak is too early to predict. The authorities have reportedly
taken rigorous steps to contain the disease in the pig farms. It would be
interesting to be informed about the steps taken by them to prevent virus
introduction into cattle holdings, which might occur by aerosols when pigs
-- efficient virus disseminators -- are involved. Is vaccination
practiced?! - Mod.AS].
