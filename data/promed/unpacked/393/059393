A colleague at University of Massachusetts Medical Center has asked me to
pass on the following description of several cases of central line associated
sepsis involving _Stenotrophomonas maltophilia_ in home care patients in
Massachusetts. This investigation is still in progress. When on-going cases
such as this are presented to the list, the APIC ICPList would appreciate
feedback from readers whose own case investigations might have directly
benefited from the information presented here.
Message content:
Three pediatric oncology patients were hospitalized at U-Mass Medical Center
on July 1st and 2nd, 1997, two with polymicrobial gram negative sepsis, one
with a single gram negative. All of the patients have indwelling central
venous catheters, have the same home care company, and receive heparin
flushes from the same manufacturer. Two of the patients experienced fever and
rigors, one with lethargy. In both cases, onset of signs/symptoms were
associated with flushing of the line. The third patient was sick enough to be
hospitalized. The mother of one case is a registered nurse and suspected that
the flush was contaminated, so she brought the remaining 2 cc's to the
hospital to be tested. She brought in two other samples, one used heparin
from another lot number and one unused (sterile) heparin from the same lot as
the one that was associated with the reaction. Samples of solution, heparin
and saline, from the other two cases were obtained and sampled in the lab.
The results of the two used samples from one child grew three gram negative
organisms, the same ID as the organisms in the cases' blood. The other
cultures were no growth. A review of the blood log at U-Mass identified two
adult out patients, with the same gram negative organism on 6/29 and 7/3. One
of the adult cases had the same home care company and was receiving heparin
flushes. Earlier in June her (the adult patient's) daughter, who is a
registered nurse, thought the solution her mother was getting was ontaminated
and asked the clinic nurse to call the company to see if it might be
contaminated and requested them to test it. The home care company thought it
was highly unlikely to be contaminated and nothing more was done. The second
adult case is a Hematology-Oncology patient who has an indwelling central
line and receives chemotherapy and heparin flushes. She has a different home
care company. She had a positive blood culture on 6/29/97. She was receiving
a unit of blood at another hospital and had a reaction, after which they
cultured her blood and it grew a gram negative organism with the same ID as
four of the other patients. I called the State Health Department and the CDC,
Atlanta, to assist with our evaluation. The home care company and the
manufacturer of the heparin were also notified.
Lab results:
Case 1, 7/2/97 blood culture _S. maltophilia_ and _Acinetobacter i[?]woffii_
and on 7/4/97 _Pseudomonas_ sp.
Case 2, blood cultures 5/2/97 and 5/3/97 _S. maltophilia_ and _Acinetobacter
baumannii_ and on 5/8/97 _Alcaligenes xylosoxidans_. The line was removed and
on7/2/97 a second episode of sepsis with _S. maltophilia_ and a second non
lactose enteric gram negative bacillus.
Case 3, 7/1/97 Child septic with _Acinetobacter baumannii_.
Case 4, adult with Hickman line in and on 7/3/97 _S. maltophilia_ which again
cultured on 7/7/97, after which the line was pulled.
Case 5, septic on 6/28 with _S. maltophilia_.
Two other Boston hospitals have reported three cases of gram negative sepsis
in patients on home IV therapy, two cases in children with _S. maltophilia_
on 7/2/97, the other on 7/3/97 and an adult with _S. maltophilia_ on 6/29/97.
If you have any cases of gram negative sepsis in patients with central lines,
with similar micro organisms, you can call the CDC's Dr. Alicia Mangran,
phone (404) 639-6412, fax (404) 639-6451. For cases occurring in
Massachusetts, you can also call Mass State DPH, Dr. Alfred DiMaria at (617)
983-6550 and the Massachusetts regional FDA Director Robert Crowell at (617)
279-1742.
If you wish to speak with an infection control practitioner familiar with
these cases, you can call Gail Potter Bynoe at (617) 355-6363.
