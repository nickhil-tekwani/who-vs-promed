The Astrakhan region has continued to report new cases of measles, and 148 cases have been confirmed during the 1st 11 months of 2013.

The Cuacasion Knot [publication] reported that in September 2013, 29 students of the Medical Academy were diagnosed with measles, and the school was closed as a quarantine measure. In mid-November 2013, the quarantine measures were extended to include the Alexander and Mary Regional Hospital in Astrakhan, where measles infection affected several staff members. It has been reported also that quarantine measures have been introduced at 6 other sites, including schools, health centres, and hospitals, and there were measles cases reported in late November 2013 involving staff and students at Astrachan College.

In addition to these educational institutions and hospitals, foci of measles virus infection have also been recorded in 3 health centres as well as at the Astrakhan State University, the Astrakhan State Technical University, and the Regional Medical College, according to the website of the Ministry of Health of Astrakhan.

However, no more cases of measles have been recorded among patients and staff at the Alexander and Mary Regional Hospital since the last measles cases among patients and staff were reported on 11 Nov 2013, and, accordingly, normal admissions have been resumed.

Particular concern has been expressed about the spread of measles virus infection among both children and doctors. Overall, up to the present, 61 children have contracted measles. To remedy the situation, attention must be devoted to measles vaccination protocols and their implementation. It has been reported that, currently, no more than 63 percent of the population have received protective vaccination.

According to local sources in Dagestan, the measles situation continues to deteriorate. A total of 120 laboratory diagnosed cases have been recorded during the current period. Of these, 63 (52.5 percent) were under one year of age. Among adults, the largest group were aged 20-29, 31.7 percent (38 cases). During November 2013, 103 cases of suspected measles were registered, of whom 44 were laboratory confirmed cases.

Cumulative evidence identified importation of measles from other regions of the Russian Federation as the source of the disease (including the Moscow, Astrakhan, Rostov, Tula, Stavropoland, and Komi Regions). The Makhachkaya and Buynaksk Regions were the most culpable. The number of unvaccinated people in these regions contributed to the spread of the disease. Measles is a particular danger for children under one year of age, before their 1st receipt of measles vaccine. Unvaccinated adults are at risk of developing more serious disease because of the likelihood of complications.

Case of vaccine-associated measles five weeks post-immunisation, British Columbia, Canada (By: M. Murti and others)

Summary:
We describe a case of vaccine-associated measles in a 2-year-old patient from British Columbia, Canada in October 2013 who received her 1st dose of measles-containing vaccine 37 days prior to onset of prodromal symptoms. Identification of this delayed vaccine-associated case occurred in the context of an outbreak investigation of a measles cluster.

Background:
In this report, we describe a case of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine-associated measles illness that was positive by both PCR and IgM 5 weeks after administration of the MMR vaccine. Based on our literature review, we believe this is the 1st such case report which has implications for both public health follow-up of measles cases and vaccine safety surveillance.

Between 29 Aug-2 Sep 2013, 3 unlinked persons from across the Fraser Valley, British Columbia, Canada presented with rash illness consistent with clinical measles. Based on the outbreak investigation by the local health authority, none of the 3 cases had an identified exposure to a measles case or travel history outside of Canada during the incubation period, and a source case was never identified. All 3 cases had the same measles genotype B3 sequence type. Measles genotype B3 is endemic in the World Health Organization's African and Eastern Mediterranean regions. Two additional cases of measles due to secondary transmission from one of the above cases were identified in British Columbia in the 3rd week of September 2013.

Case report:
In early October 2013, a 2-year-old child living in the Fraser Valley presented to the family physician with fever, rash, conjunctivitis and coryza. Symptoms had begun 2 days before, with a runny nose, followed by fever on the day hereafter. A macular rash appeared on the day of visiting the physician, starting on the face and progressing to the rest of the body; fever measured by the parents was at 39 C [102 F].

Clinical examination of the child by the family physician found a fever of 39.5 C [102 F], marked bilateral conjunctivitis, and macular rash over the body. Three days later, fever had dissipated, the rash was fading, and symptoms resolved without complications.

Public health alerts had been issued to community physicians regarding the recent cluster of measles in September 2013, which may have raised suspicion for measles in this case. Additionally, the child's family was aware of measles cases in the community from a relative who attended the same church as one of the original cases, but no direct link was identified, and they had no travel history outside of Canada. Contact investigation revealed no ill household members or preschool contacts. The child's past medical history indicated anaphylaxis to peanuts and eggs. The primary series of immunisations were not up-to-date, as she had just received her 1st dose of MMR vaccine 37 days prior to the onset of illness. At the same visit, the child had received meningococcal C and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines.

Laboratory testing for measles was performed on specimens collected on the day of rash onset [Interested readers should access the original document to obtain a detailed account of these investigations].

While genotyping results were pending, case management proceeded as for a wild-type measles infection [Interested readers should access the original document to obtain a detailed account of these investigations].

Discussion:
The incubation period of measles is typically 8 to 12 days from exposure to rash onset, with a range from 7 to 21 days. Public health interventions are based on this established incubation period for determining the epidemiological links between cases and for estimating periods of exclusion for contacts in high risk settings. Based on our review of the literature, this report documents the 1st case of MMR vaccine-associated measles, 37 days post-immunisation, well beyond 21 days and the routine 30 days post-MMR immunisation period used by the Canadian adverse event following immunization (AEFI) surveillance system.

Measles-containing vaccines are used globally, have been part of the British Columbia immunisation schedule since 1969, and have an impressive record of safety validated by careful, ongoing AEFI surveillance. Rash and/or mild clinical illness following MMR vaccine are not uncommon. Clinically significant vaccine-associated illness is rare, but when it occurs, it is indistinguishable from wild-type measles, except by genotyping. Detection of vaccine virus has been documented up to 14 days post-immunisation by RT-PCR and up to 16 days by immunofluorescence microscopy of urine sediment. Complications from vaccine-associated measles have been documented in both immune-competent and compromised individuals. Of note, only one case report of transmission from vaccine-associated measles has been identified.

Possible explanations for this prolonged shedding of measles vaccine virus include interference with the immune response by host or vaccine factors. Immunoglobulin administration early in the incubation period has been reported to extend the time to onset of symptoms, but in this child, there was no such history and no known immunosuppressive illness. The 2-fold rise between acute and convalescent measles-specific IgG suggests the vaccine-mediated immune response had been underway prior to the onset of symptoms. Investigations clarified that there were no shipping, handling or cold-chain deviations for the specific vaccine used, and that it was administered by a public health nurse trained in immunisations. The potential immunological impact of the older age of the child at the time of receiving the 1st dose of MMR vaccine, 33 months versus the typical 12-15 months of age, and the co-administration of meningococcal C and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are areas for future investigation.

It is possible that the case's symptoms were not measles-vaccine-related but an inter-current illness confounding the presentation. However, symptoms of marked conjunctivitis, continued fever with rash, and progression of macular rash from face to the whole body are all more suggestive of measles versus other exanthems [widespread rash] caused by viral diseases. Parvovirus and HHV-6 results were negative, and the absence of intake of medications excludes a drug reaction. Rubella serology was not done, as it was expected to be positive given the recent MMR vaccine administration. Therefore, the combination of classic measles symptoms, detection of measles vaccine virus and reactive measles IgM, and lack of evidence of an alternative illness explanation were highly suggestive of measles vaccine-associated illness.

Heightened surveillance and awareness of measles because of the ongoing outbreak likely contributed to the identification of this case. Although this is the 1st such reported case, it likely represents the existence of additional, but unidentified, exceptions to the typical timeframe for measles vaccine virus shedding and illness. Such cases have important public health implications for the investigation of measles clusters because, while there is uncertainty about case classification (wild-type vs. vaccine-type), case and contact management should proceed as if for wild-type to prevent secondary transmission. In this case, uncertainty from the presence of a measles outbreak, symptom onset on day 37 after MMR vaccine administration, and a 2-week period between the RT-PCR findings and genotype determination resulted in the initially reasonable presumption that this was a wild-type measles case and subsequent resource-intense follow-up of contacts. Awareness of the frequency of such exceptions to the typical measles timeframe and improving the timeliness of measles vaccine virus genotyping could help focus public health resources on cases of wild-type measles. Further investigation is needed on the upper limit of measles vaccine virus shedding based on increased sensitivity of the RT-PCR-based detection technologies and the immunological factors associated with vaccine-associated measles illness and virus shedding.

Leaders at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are expected to hold a media tele-briefing at 12:30 p.m. on Thu 5 Dec 2013 to address the recent spike in measles cases in the U.S. As of 30 Nov 2013, there have been 175 cases reported in 2013, which is nearly triple the annual average of 60 cases. At least 2 of the 175 cases were in Michigan. According to the Michigan Department of Community Health, both of those cases involved babies under 12 months of age, and both of them recovered.

This year [2013], outbreaks have been reported in New York and North Carolina. The outbreak in New York was the largest in 15 years. The CDC says most of the people who contracted the virus had not been vaccinated. Nearly a quarter of the patients who were infected had also traveled out of the country, according to the CDC.

The CDC urges parents to get their children vaccinated against measles. It's also recommended that adults born in 1957 or after who have not contracted measles or been vaccinated receive at least one dose of the vaccine.

http://www.examiner.com/article/measles-cases-climb-despite-50-years-of-vaccine-use


The Centers for Disease Control are hosting a briefing on 5 Dec 2013 to celebrate 50 years of the measles vaccine and to discuss the spike in measles cases in 2013. The CDC reported on 5 Dec 2013 that through 30 Nov 2013, they have been notified of 175 measles cases in the United States this year [2013]. This number of cases places 2013 2nd only to 2011, when there were 222 cases, the highest number since 1996.

The measles vaccine was approved for use in 1963. The History of Vaccines website has this to say: After demonstrating its safety and efficacy, 1st in monkeys and then humans, John Enders and colleagues declared their measles vaccine capable of preventing infection. Their Edmonston-B strain of measles virus was transformed into a vaccine licensed in the United States in 1963, and nearly 19 million doses would be administered over the next 12 years. Three outbreaks in the United States account for the majority of the 2013 measles cases.

In March 2013, an Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn experienced the largest measles outbreak since 1996. Three extended families were at the center of the outbreak, and a total of 58 measles cases were diagnosed. None of the patients had a documented measles vaccination, and 12 of them were infants, too young to receive the vaccine. The index case, the source of the outbreak, had traveled to London and returned infected.

In April and May 2013, an outbreak in North Carolina resulted in a total of 23 measles cases. According to WRAL, the center of the outbreak was the Hare Krishna community of Prabhupada Village. Over 100 people had to be quarantined by public health authorities. 18 of the 23 patients were not vaccinated, and 2 other patients had an unknown vaccination status. The index case had returned from travel to India.

During the summer [2013], an outbreak of measles occurred in the Dallas/Fort Worth metro area. Public health authorities linked 21 measles cases to the Eagle Mountain International Church in Newark, Texas and the Kenneth Copeland Ministries. The megachurch was noted for opposing vaccinations prior to this outbreak. The vaccine status of the patients was similar to the other 2 outbreaks. 16 patients had not been immunized, and the status of the remaining 5 patients could not be determined. The index case had returned from a visit to Indonesia.

A 13 Sep 2013 report from the CDC looked at 159 measles cases reported from 1 Jan-24 Aug 2013. Vaccine status was significant, with 131 patients unvaccinated and an additional 15 with an unknown status. Infants too young to be vaccinated made up 11 percent, 18 cases, of the total.

The CDC describes the toll taken by measles before the vaccine was available: Before measles vaccine, nearly all children got measles by the time they were 15 years of age. Each year in the United States, about 450-500 people died because of measles, 48 000 were hospitalized, 7000 had seizures, and about 1000 suffered permanent brain damage or deafness.

Abstract:
Measles was 1st imported into the New World in the early 16th century by European colonists, often with devastating effects on native populations. Rubella importation followed and led to congenital rubella syndrome. It is estimated that during the following 5 centuries, more than 200 million people globally died of measles. Disease incidence fell rapidly after the availability of vaccines in the United States for measles in 1963 and rubella in 1969, and after the availability of a combined measles-rubella vaccine in 1971. As vaccination expanded into other countries of the Americas, the Pan American Health Organization established a goal to eliminate measles from the Western hemisphere by 2002 and rubella by 2010. By 2004, transmission had been interrupted in the United States. However, there has been concern that pockets of transmission persist or that transmission could be reestablished if immunization coverage levels decline.

In this issue of the journal, Papania and colleagues report that an expert panel convened by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that the elimination of endemic measles, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome has been sustained for a decade. Along with certifications from other countries in the Americas, the entire Western hemisphere will be certified free of indigenous transmission.

The elimination of measles and rubella from the Western hemisphere is a triumph of public health with several important implications. 1st, imported cases of measles and rubella will still likely occur as long as there remain endemic areas in the world. That these imported cases do not result in sustained transmission is confirmation that the level of population immunity is high enough for elimination.

Prior to 1990, Mexico was the leading source of measles importations into the United States, but this year [2013], half of all importations into the United States were from Europe. Since 2008, there has been a resurgence of measles cases in Western European countries. The majority of these outbreaks have been in unimmunized populations in countries where national immunization programs are being challenged by a combination of public and political complacency regarding the value of immunization and by the rising influence of anti-vaccination groups. After 500 years, we have now returned to a situation where the Americas are free from indigenous measles and rubella with Europe once again a source of importations.

A 2nd implication of the elimination of measles and rubella in the Western hemisphere is that it is a vindication of US vaccination strategy. Over the years, the United States experienced several false starts for measles and rubella elimination, with multiple missed target dates, but systematically incorporated the lessons learned from each failure into subsequent efforts. The essential elements of the final successful strategy were that (1) coverage with a 1st dose of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine must be early, high, and sustained (in the United States, MMR vaccination rates among children younger than 2 years of age have been more than 90 percent for a decade); (2) each person must receive 2 doses of MMR vaccine (94.8 percent of children entering kindergarten have received 2 doses of MMR vaccine); and (3) disease surveillance must include laboratory confirmation of suspected cases (there is a robust surveillance system for measles and genetic analysis of each virus to identify imported cases and their geographic source). It is encouraging that the European region has now endorsed these essential strategies, emphasizing routine vaccination and disease surveillance.

The greatest threat to the US vaccination program may now come from parents' hesitancy to vaccinate their children. Although this so-called vaccine hesitancy has not become as widespread in the United States as it appears to have become in Europe, it is increasing. Many measles outbreaks can be traced to people refusing to be vaccinated; a recent large measles outbreak was attributable to a church advocating the refusal of measles vaccination.

Even greater risk may come from parents who delay vaccinations rather than refusing them outright, because a delayed vaccination may add more person-years of susceptibility than that due to refusing vaccination.

The single most important factor influencing decision making on childhood vaccination is the clear recommendation of a physician; clinicians must recognize their responsibility in supporting early vaccination. To address this issue, the National Vaccine Advisory Committee has convened a working group on vaccine hesitancy and has made some recommendations on how best to respond to it.

Although the effect of expanded measles immunization in the United States has been a substantial decrease in morbidity, a notable effect in developing countries has been a substantial decrease in mortality. The aim of Millennium Development Goal 4 is to reduce the overall number of deaths among children by 2/3rds by 2015 compared with the level in 1990. There are now 550 000 fewer annual deaths from measles today than there were a decade ago.

Fully 1/4th of all mortality reduction toward Millennium Development Goal 4 has been due to measles control. Over 30 African countries now have more than 80 percent measles vaccination coverage resulting in a 91 percent decline in measles mortality. The success of global measles and rubella control is largely due to an innovative partnership, the Measles-Rubella Initiative, which was started in 2001 and has since supported delivering more than one billion doses of vaccine. Special recognition is due to the American Red Cross, which convened and hosts the initiative, and its partners, the United Nations Foundation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United Nations Children's Fund [UNICEF], and the World Health Organization.

The ending of the measles and rubella pandemic in the Western hemisphere is a stepping stone to global eradication. There is a consensus that the global eradication of measles will proceed if there is progress toward these regional goals. Has such progress been made? With close to 20 million people, Sao Paolo in Brazil may be the largest city in the world. With an estimated population of 4 million people, Mexico City's Neza-Chalco-Itza is considered to be the largest slum on the planet. New York City is one of the largest and most visited cities in the world. Disease transmission has such an advantage in these cities that it would seem implausible to control any infectious diseases, much less eliminate 2 of the most infectious ones. And yet, even in these settings, measles and rubella have been eliminated for a decade. The world need look no further for proof that global eradication of measles and rubella can be successful.

A far south coast town is being urged to be on the alert for a potential measles outbreak. The Southern New South Wales Local Health District says an Eden woman did not know she had the disease and spent a lot of time in the community over recent weeks. The District's Director of Public Health, Tracey Oakman, says anyone who develops symptoms should see a doctor immediately and should phone ahead so they can be kept separate from other patients. Ms Oakman says infants and unvaccinated people are particularly at risk.

"It's important to realise that the symptoms of measles can be fever, tiredness, a runny nose, cough, sore and red eyes, and you can get a blotchy rash," she said. "And you can actually get quite serious complications from measles, so it's really important that if people develop those symptoms, they go and get diagnosed.

It is, in Australia, a fairly rare disease these days, but it is highly infectious, and someone can actually be in a room where someone with measles has been in the previous 2 hours and left and still come down with it.

Southern NSW Local Health District Public Health Director Tracey Oakman said many people in Eden may have been exposed to measles over recent weeks. "I think it's fair to say that the measles patient would have come into contact with a number of people in the community," she said. "We don't know necessarily who they all are, so it's just important that people in the community be aware of measles.

Health authorities are warning South Australians to make sure their children's immunisations are up to date with new figures showing the number of measles cases has tripled in the state in the past 12 months.

Medicare Local Country South Australian board member and general practitioner Grant Baker said there had been 16 outbreaks this year [2013] compared to 6 last year. The number includes 3 new cases reported in the past month [December 2013]. Doctor Baker said measles is extremely contagious, and anybody who thinks that they may have symptoms should avoid public places and visit their doctor immediately.

"The infectious period is from 5 days before the appearance of the rash to 4 days after the appearance of the rash." Dr Baker said maintaining high vaccination rates (at least 90 percent) was an important factor toward stopping the spread of the disease and protecting the wider community, especially infants, children, and other vulnerable people during outbreaks such as this latest episode.

In recent weeks, people with infectious measles have spent time in Noarlunga, Port Noarlunga South, Seaford, Morphett Vale, Marion, McLaren Vale, Christies Beach, Belair, Pasadena, Seacliff, Bowden, Lonsdale, Woodcroft and Adelaide City, including Old Noarlunga Primary School and Moana Primary School. These people have visited medical centres at Seaford, Noarlunga, Happy Valley and Hackham and Flinders Medical Centre, and Noarlunga Health Service while infectious.

Measles is a highly contagious viral infection transmitted via respiratory aerosols that remain a risk to others for up to 2 hours after the person has left the area. The incubation period is about 10 days (range 7-18 days) to the onset of symptoms and about 14 days to the appearance of the rash.

Another person has contracted measles virus infection in Queensland. There have been more than 30 cases of the potentially deadly virus this year [2013] despite the disease having been eradicated from Australia.

Metro North Public Health Unit director Dr Susan Vlack says the patient was diagnosed on 30 Nov 2013, but authorities haven't identified the source of the infection. She says the patient visited Chermside, Deception Bay and Redcliffe while infectious, and people living in those areas should be alert to symptoms.

"Because the patient has no link to an identified case, there are likely to be other cases in the community," Dr Vlack said in a statement. "If you are unwell with symptoms of measles, you should contact your GP to make an appointment. You should inform the practice that you may have measles so that other patients can be protected from exposure."
