A young Indonesian man is suspected of having contracted avian influenza after
a local test result showed positive, and health officials said on Tuesday [4
Oct 2005] a specimen would be sent to a Hong Kong laboratory for further
testings. I Nyoman Kandun, head of disease control at Indonesia's Health
Ministry, said the young man's condition was stable and he was being cared for
at a hospital in Bandar Lampung on Sumatra island designated to treat people
with bird flu symptoms.
"Although the local test shows that he is positive, we don't want to reach any
conclusion yet, as we are awaiting results from Hong Kong," Kandun told
Reuters. Common symptoms of the disease, such as pneumonia, can have other
causes, while local testing has not always squared with results from the Hong
Kong laboratory recognised by the World Health Organisation (WHO).
Indonesian officials have said 5 people are believed to have died in the
country from H5N1 virus infection. The World Health Organisation puts the
number of dead at 3, based on Hong Kong tests, and says there is a 4th case of
a boy who has the disease but is alive and in stable condition.
"We have received patients with similar symptoms, but they proved to be from
other causes," Kandun said. Separately, Agriculture Minister Anton Apriyantono
said authorities have found infected fowl in the neighbourhoods of the
victims. "There is a link between human victims with (infected) fowl in the
surrounding area. However, we are not certain if (they) were exposed from the
neighbourhoods," Apriyantono told reporters.
Officials have said suspected human cases have come from 9 provinces out of 33
across Indonesia's sprawling archipelago. The virus has spread to 22 provinces
and more than 10 million fowl have been culled since late 2003.

A critically ill 68-year-old man suspected of [having contracted avian
influenza] died on Sunday [2 Oct 2005] after being treated in hospital for
less than a week. The patient died at the Sulianti Saroso Hospital for
infectious diseases after being admitted on 30 Sep 2005. He owned a chicken
farm in Bogor, hospital staff said on Monday.
"We have yet to get the test results, but he showed similar symptoms to those
of other confirmed avian influenza patients," hospital head of information and
bird flu surveillance Sardikin Giri Putro said [but those symptoms were also
similar to the symptoms of other respiratory infections -- see next
paragraph. - Mod.JW]. The deceased patient's body was wrapped in layers of
plastic sheeting and put in a coffin to contain the spread of the virus.
Sardikin said the patient died of acute pneumonia.
The hospital to date has treated 22 people suspected of having the virus. The
hospital previously discharged 5 patients after they tested negative for bird
flu. The hospital said the patients were suffering from the common flu, lung
or respiratory infections. The 5, however, will be required to report to the
hospital regularly after they return home to monitor their condition.

A 5-year-old boy from Wonogondo village, Kebonagung subdistrict, Madiun, East
Java, was rushed to Dr Soedono Hospital on Friday night after being treated at
the Pacitan Regional Hospital since Thursday, a doctor confirmed on Saturday
[1 Sep 2005]. "We are still [doing] some (medical) tests on him and cannot yet
make any conclusion," Doctor (med) Sutowo, one of the 4-member team in charge
of handling the deadly virus, said.
The boy's mother meanwhile said [her] son was brought to the Madiun Regional
Hospital after his condition worsened. She said [her] son got bird flu
symptoms after 15 of her chickens were found dead suddenly. Their death might
be due to the deadly [H5N1] virus. The boy is the 2nd suspected avian
influenza case in East Java.

[These 3 cases add to the increasing number of suspected human cases of avian
H5N1 influenza cases reported from Indonesia. However, few have been confirmed
when referred to the WHO-designated reference laboratory in Hong Kong. One of
the conclusions of the analysis of human cases of avian H5N1 influenza
conducted by the WHO Writing Committee (see the ProMED-mail post entitled:
Avian influenza, human - East Asia (138): WHO review 20051003.2892) is
that: "Case detection is confounded by the non-specificity of initial
manifestations of illness, so that detailed contact and travel histories and
knowledge of viral activity in poultry are essential. Commercial rapid antigen
tests are insensitive, and confirmatory diagnosis requires sophisticated
laboratory support." As of 29 Sep 2005 the WHO was able to confirm no more
than 4 cases of avian influenza in Indonesia by laboratory testing. - Mod.CP]
