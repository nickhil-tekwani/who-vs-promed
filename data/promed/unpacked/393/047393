Regarding ProMED-mail post "Syphilis - USA (09): (CA) pregnant women, congenital, rising incidence 20150715.3512635," thank you for this interesting and timely information.

The initial part of the sentence in the last paragraph [in the moderator comments section of the post] may lead to misunderstanding: "Penicillin G is the only known effective antimicrobial for treating maternal infection..." As described later in the same paragraph, benzathine penicillin G (Bicillin L-A) is the substance which should be administered.

I have seen 3 cases of therapeutic failure recently because doctors administered Penicillin G (inappropriate dosage/duration) or benzathine procaine penicillin to their patients.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Burens for his comments.

Dr. Burens is absolutely right, and that is why I added, for emphasis, the product name "Bicillin L-A" in parentheses after benzathine penicillin in the moderator comment section of the post.

Prolonged serum concentrations of penicillin G are considered essential for treating syphilis effectively. Because penicillin G is rapidly excreted (serum half-life about 0.5 hours), repository forms (benzathine or procaine salt of penicillin G) after IM administration provide a tissue depot from which absorption takes place slowly. 3 benzathine products are available for adults: Bicillin L-A (benzathine penicillin G alone); Bicillin C-R (a mixture of equal amounts of benzathine and procaine penicillin G); and Bicillin C-R 900/300 (a mixture of 0.9 million units (MU) benzathine and 0.3 MU procaine penicillin G). Benzathine penicillin G reaches its peak more slowly and provides more sustained serum levels (up to 30 days) than does benzathine penicillin G/procaine penicillin G mixtures (up to 7 days). Benzathine penicillin G reaches its peak more slowly and provides more sustained serum levels (up to 30 days) than does benzathine penicillin G/procaine penicillin G mixtures (up to 7 days). Only Bicillin L-A (in a 2.4 MU dose) is recommended for treating syphilis; a 2.4 MU dose of Bicillin C-R contains 1.2 MU of benzathine penicillin G and 1.2 MU of procaine penicillin G, i.e., only half the recommended dose of benzathine penicillin G for treatment of syphilis, and treatment failures have possibly occurred among those treated with Bicillin C-R (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5409a1.htm).

Guidelines for management of syphilis during pregnancy can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/syphilis-pregnancy.htm. Pregnant women should be treated with the penicillin regimen appropriate for their stage of infection, the regimens being the same as those for non-pregnant women. An intramuscular injection of benzathine penicillin G (Bicillin L-A, 2.4 million units administered intramuscularly) will cure a person who has primary, secondary or early latent syphilis. Three doses of benzathine penicillin G (Bicillin L-A, 2.4 million units administered intramuscularly) at weekly intervals is recommended for individuals with late latent syphilis or latent syphilis of unknown duration. Some evidence suggests that additional therapy is beneficial for pregnant women. For women who have primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis, a 2nd dose of benzathine penicillin (Bicillin L-A) 2.4 million units IM can be administered one week after the initial dose (http://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/syphilis-pregnancy.htm). - Mod.ML]
