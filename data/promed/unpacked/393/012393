Haiti's cholera epidemic has killed 132 people and may have infected nearly 15 000 others so far in 2014, a UN agency report said Wednesday, 26 Nov 2014. The Caribbean country's cholera outbreak started in 2010 and "an unacceptable number of people have been affected, with nearly 712 330 suspected cases and an estimated 8655 deaths," the report by the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said, citing Haiti's public health ministry. In 2014, there have been a suspected 14 869 cases and 132 deaths recorded, the report said.

Aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres [MSF] said there was a lack of beds for patients to recover. "More than 2000 people presenting symptoms of cholera needed emergency hospitalization since mid-October 2014 in Port-au-Prince," MSF said. "A majority of the Haitian population remain exposed to cholera due to lack of access to clean water and latrines, the treatment capacity of the sick is still inadequate," MSF said.

OCHA has seen a "very significant increase" in the incidence in cholera in the metropolitan areas of Port-au-Prince and the surrounding areas since late September 2014, partly due to strong rains.

"Patients come to us in critical condition as there is no system in place to provide urgent care, despite the existence of a national plan for the elimination of cholera, said Oliver Schulz, head of MSF in Haiti.

International organizations providing cholera treatment have called for extra support to fight cholera and warn an early withdrawal of their services could jeopardize the gains made in containing the outbreak. Haiti's health system still can't meet the needs of cholera patients, MSF said.

[Although the number of reported cases of _Vibrio cholerae_ infection has decreased to the point where Haiti is not number 1 in cases currently in 2014 (Nigeria and Ghana have more), this is the beginning of the 5th year of the outbreak without a real end in sight. - Mod.LL

13 people have been admitted to the hospitals of Juan de Herrera and San Juan de la Maguana related to symptoms of cholera. Of these, 6 are in the hospital of San Juan de la Maguana and 7 in the municipality of Juan de Herrera [San Juan province, Dominican Republic].

The majority come from communities of the northern area of San Juan de la Maguana [San Juan province], among these, the Maguanas, Canafistol and surrounding areas. So far the authorities have not confirmed if the diarrheal outbreaks have to do with the cholera outbreak which has affected hundreds of people in the past few years.
