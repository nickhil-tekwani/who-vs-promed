Livestock die of epidemic in Arunachal
--------------------------------------
A large number of cattle and other livestock of Poma, Rillo, and Jote
villages near here have died here following the outbreak of an unknown
disease, officials said. Domestic animals like cow, goat and chicken
have been dying in large numbers since the outbreak, though veterinary
officials visited Poma village and provided medicine to the livestock.
The cause of grave concern is the death of mithuns, which is the
Indian buffalo, found in Arunachal Pradesh and North-East. Traditional
methods have failed to cure the animals, official sources said here
today. "Villagers are selling the mithuns at throwaway prices of about
Rs 2000 [USD 44.43] each," the gaon bura of Poma village said.

Animal husbandry and veterinary director Dr Hage Tabin said that a
team of veterinary doctors would visit soon to carry out further
investigation. Mithun (_Bos frontalis_), a domesticated free-range
bovine species, is an important component of the livestock production
system of North-East. This unique species is believed to have been
domesticated more than 8000 years ago, sources said. Mithun is
primarily reared for meat and is highly preferred among tribes people
as a ceremonial animal.

[Cattle, goats and chickens have very different preferred diets from
each other, and do not attract the same insect vectors. The
information provided so far is deficient and only allows speculation
that it might be some toxic feed to affect all 3. Until more
information is available it is an open question.

It is unusual for a disease to affect cattle, goats and poultry, all
at the same time. Consequently, this is suspicious of a chemical in
the grain that is fed to all of these animals. Grain from a single
source can be used to manufacture rations for all of these species. We
have seen previous grain related poisonings from such things as
dioxins. Grains are often treated with a chemicals prior to being
planted and have in the past been unintentionally diverted to animal
feeds and in at least one case human food.

It is unlikely that an entire region would have a common source of
water. So I would rule that out. However for this number of species to
be affected, I would be looking at the source of grains, and or
mineral supplements. - Mod.TG]
