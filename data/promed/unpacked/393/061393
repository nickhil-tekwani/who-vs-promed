The 1st case of anthrax to occur this summer [2021] has been confirmed in New South Wales (NSW), prompting the state's Department of Primary Industries (DPI) and Local Land Services (LLS) to urge producers to vaccinate at-risk livestock.

In late January [2021], anthrax was detected in an unvaccinated mob of ewes and lambs on a property in the state's Central West. The property had a previous history of anthrax. The affected animals were ewes which had not been vaccinated for anthrax, and biosecurity measures at the affected property, including stock movement restrictions and the vaccination of remaining livestock, were immediately imposed.

NSW DPI senior veterinary officer Graham Bailey said while there were no general public health risks or trade implications from the detection, it served as a timely reminder.

Cases of anthrax in NSW tended to occur in a region which runs through the centre of the state, between Bourke and Moree in the north, to Albury and Deniliquin in the south, Dr. Bailey said. "Anthrax can be prevented by annual vaccination of cattle and sheep. Producers in high-risk locations are encouraged to consider vaccination," he said. Ingestion of soil by cattle, sheep and other ruminants was one of the key risk factors for anthrax, Dr. Bailey said.

Other risk factors include a history of anthrax on the property, grazing stubble or very short pastures, low ground cover, deep cultivation or earthworks in paddocks, soil movement or exposure as a result of rain, contact with infected carcasses and alkaline soils which favour spore survival.

LLS Animal Biosecurity and Welfare business partner Scott Ison said farmers can apply to use the anthrax vaccine through their LLS district veterinarian. "Once authorised, applicants can place an order for the vaccine with their local rural supplier or private veterinarian," Dr. Ison said.

Anthrax, a notifiable disease which must be reported immediately to the Emergency Animal Disease Hotline, is listed as prohibited matter under the NSW Biosecurity Act.

[This region of New South Wales is behind Sidney on the southeast part of NSW; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_West_(New_South_Wales).

Livestock anthrax in this part of Australia is well studied and mapped, and control programmes and procedures utilize it. The owners of this flock ignored the real need for annual vaccination and are now paying the price.

A key ProMED post to read is from 22 Jun 2016: Anthrax - Australia: niche modeling of historic distribution 20160622.4302780. To see the niche maps generated, go to https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27280981. There is a fair amount of prediction details in these maps. This later 30 Oct 2019 report (https://www.sheepcentral.com/new-nsw-anthrax-outbreak-prompts-second-vaccination-call/) has a map of Australia showing the various provinces and the historic anthrax belt that stretches from northwest Victoria through New South Wales to Queensland.

There is a wide band of high risk for anthrax spore survival, and disease, through New South Wales. If this farm has not reported livestock anthrax before, neighbouring farms will have. A problem with observing ovine anthrax is that random sporadic deaths can be ignored, and this is usually the case. Veterinary help is sought when the numbers reach somewhere between 18 and 24 animals, which is a bit late, and properly disposing of that number of carcasses can be a challenge. This flock will need to undertake annual anthrax vaccination for the next 5 years, at least. When your ranch or farm is in a recognised high-risk zone, it is inviting trouble to not vaccinate your livestock. - Mod.MHJ
