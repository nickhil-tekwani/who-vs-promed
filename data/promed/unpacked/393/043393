Unknown disease damages maize crops
-----------------------------------
An unknown disease has started destroying maize crops in 4 villages of
the eastern part of Dang [Mid-Western Region]. The disease has already
damaged the maize crops planted on over 10 hectares of land, said a
local farmer. It is said that symptoms like drying and burning of
leaves have been seen in the maize plants. The victims have complained
that no agriculture technician has come yet to the villages for
inspection.

[A large number of pathogens is known to affect maize. Drying and
'burning' symptoms on leaves, as described above, can be due to
several of them, particularly a number of the fungal diseases. We
would be most grateful for any further information on this problem.
