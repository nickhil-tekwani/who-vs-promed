There are growing concerns over rising drug-resistant strains of the killer tuberculosis [TB] in the country [Kenya].

According to the Ministry of Health latest statistics, 305 cases of multi-drug resistant [MDR] TB have been reported in the country this year so far, the highest figure in the last ten years. In 2014, there were 283 cases; while in 2013, the number was 285. The statistics shows a trend in which the numbers of such cases have been increasing since 2006 when 82 cases were reported. The total number of Kenyans who have so far been reported to have the disease since 2006 is 1790, with many cases believed to go unreported.

The World Health Organisation currently estimates that at least 2750 Kenyans are infected with MDR-TB every year, with many cases being unreported.

TB, which is caused by bacteria [_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_], often becomes resistant to the available drugs when people do not complete the full course of treatment. It also emerges when health care providers prescribe the wrong treatment or when the supply of drugs is not always available; or when the drugs are of poor quality.

Director of Medical Services Dr Nicholas Muraguri said that currently at least Sh [Kenyan shillings] 1 billion [about USD 9.8 million] is being spent to treat more than 500 Kenyans who have drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis. While treating ordinary TB costs about Sh 8000 [about USD 78] for 6 months, the treatment of drug-resistant TB costs at least Sh 2 million [about USD 19 570] per person for a period lasting about two years.

Dr Muraguri said that in the recent few years, at least 917 cases of drug-resistant TB have been treated in the country. "So far, Kenya has one of the most successful treatment rates of drug-resistant TB," he said.

Dr Muraguri indicated that they will also partner with the United Nations and other stakeholders to enhance TB treatment for refugees. "We are looking into the possibility of TB treatment being provided inside Somalia since many refugees come to Kenya for treatment," he said.

According Evaline Kibuchi, National Coordinator for Stop TB initiative said that Kenyans who have MDR-TB are likely to infect others due to lack of awareness and stigma. He said that some of them should be moving around with special face masks to minimise risks of infecting; others don't do so for fear of being shunned by others. "Currently, we are seeing some persons with drug-resistant TB using public transport or interacting with others without the masks. Such habits may drive up the number of Kenyans with such strains of TB," she said. She added: "We need more awareness to help those with TB to follow recommended practices as well as reduce levels of stigma against Kenyans with TB."
