Outbreak of Group A Streptococcal Pneumonia Among Marine Corps
Recruits - California, 1 Nov - 20 Dec 2002
-------------------------------------------------
During 1 Nov - 20 Dec 2002, a total of 163 Marine Corps personnel
from the Marine Corps Recruit Depot (MCRD) in San Diego, California,
including 160 new recruits, were admitted to the Naval Medical Center
San Diego (NMCSD) for possible pneumonia. For 128 (79 percent)
patients, pneumonia was confirmed by chest radiograph; of these 128
cases, 31 (24 percent) were definitely or probably caused by group A
streptococci (GAS). This is the first outbreak of serious
GAS-associated illness at a San Diego military training facility
since the 1987 outbreak of rheumatic fever (1) and the largest
outbreak of GAS pneumonia in the United States since 1968 (2). This
report summarizes the results of the investigation of this outbreak,
which indicate that GAS infection can occur among military recruit
populations despite routine chemoprophylaxis administered to incoming
recruits. Instituting routine surveillance for noninvasive GAS
disease in military training facilities might prevent future invasive
GAS outbreaks.
All patients with radiographically confirmed pneumonia were tested by
sputum, blood, and throat cultures; _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ IgM
(ETI-MP enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA], Diasorin, Inc.)
and IgG (ELISA, Wampole); _Chlamydia pneumoniae_ IgM and IgG
(microimmuno-fluorescence, Focus Technologies); rhinoprobe direct
fluorescent antibody for respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus,
influenzae, and parainfluenzae; urine _Legionella_ antigen test;
urine _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ antigen test; and an
antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer. Available GAS isolates underwent
emm-typing through sequencing of the 5' emm variable region and
antimicrobial susceptibility testing by broth microdilution and
E-test.
All case definitions required radiographic confirmation of pneumonia
in a marine recruit hospitalized with acute respiratory illness (ARI)
during the outbreak period. A confirmed case of GAS pneumonia
required a blood or pleural fluid culture that was positive for GAS.
A probable case of GAS pneumonia required a positive throat or sputum
culture for GAS or an ASO titer of >250 Todd units in the absence of
another identified etiologic agent. A confirmed case of _M.
pneumoniae_ pneumonia required IgG seroconversion, and a probable
case required a positive IgM. A confirmed case of _C. pneumoniae_
required a fourfold rise in IgG or an IgM titer of >16, and a
possible case required an IgG titer of >512.
A total of 128 male recruits aged 18-33 years (median: 20 years) had
radiographically confirmed pneumonia; 110 (86 percent) were white
non-Hispanics, 14 (11 percent) were white Hispanics, and 4 (3
percent) were members of other racial/ethnic groups. All recruits
were previously healthy and were seronegative for human
immunodeficiency virus. Of the 128 recruits with confirmed pneumonia,
66 (52 percent) had multilobar involvement, and 29 (23 percent) had a
pleural effusion, including 5 (4 percent) with an empyema. GAS was
identified in 31 (24 percent) pneumonia episodes (6 confirmed and 25
probable GAS cases), resulting in a GAS pneumonia attack rate of 0.7
percent among the approximately 4500 recruits present at the training
facility during 1 Nov - 20 Dec 2002. An etiologic agent could be
established for 47 (48 percent) of 97 remaining pneumonia episodes
and for 78 (61 percent) of the pneumonia episodes overall (for table
see original citation). Multiple etiologies were identified for
several pneumonia cases; one patient had confirmed GAS and confirmed
_C. pneumoniae_ infections, and 3 patients had confirmed GAS and
possible _C. pneumoniae_. Sputum or throat cultures were positive for
GAS or the patient had an ASO of >250 Todd units in two (29 percent)
of the 7 confirmed and 5 (28 percent) of the 18 possible _C.
pneumoniae_ cases, one (33 percent) of the 3 confirmed and 9 (56
percent) of the 16 probable _M. pneumoniae_ cases, and one (20
percent) of the 5 adenovirus cases.
Symptoms reported by the 31 recruits with GAS pneumonia included
cough (29 [94 percent]), fever (20 [65 percent]), sore throat (19 [61
percent]), pleuritic chest pain (15 [48 percent]), dyspnea (14 [45
percent]), chills (9 [29 percent]), and exanthem (2 [7 percent]). The
mean ASO titer for GAS pneumonia cases was 997 Todd units (range:
<25->4800) compared with 249 for non-GAS cases (p = 0.03). Those with
GAS were more likely to have an empyema (16 percent versus 0 percent;
p = 0.005) and had a longer mean hospital stay (5.4 versus 2.4 days;
p = 0.03) than those with non-GAS pneumonia. 2 patients with GAS had
streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (TSS) and required intensive care
management. All recruits with pneumonia were treated successfully
with ceftriaxone and either levofloxacin or azithromycin; clindamycin
also was administered to those with TSS. One marine recruit died of
purpura fulminans caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup C
during the outbreak period.
All GAS isolates were identified as emm type 3. In addition, all GAS
isolates were susceptible to all 15 antibiotics tested, including
penicillin, erythromycin, and azithromycin.
Before the outbreak, recruits had received intramuscular benzathine
penicillin on the day of arrival at MCRD and 28 days later (or oral
erythromycin twice daily) as prophylaxis against streptococcal
disease. Of the 31 recruits with GAS pneumonia, 27 (87 percent) were
hospitalized with suspected pneumonia >21 days after the last dose of
penicillin was administered. The epidemic was halted by
re-administration of antibiotic prophylaxis to all 4500 recruits at
the facility on 15 Dec 2002 by using benzathine penicillin 1.2
million units intramuscularly; azithromycin 1 g was administered
orally for those recruits who reported a penicillin allergy (for
figure see original citation). Medical personnel from NMCSD, MCRD,
and the Naval Health Research Center were involved in halting the
outbreak.

MMWR Editorial Note:
Outbreaks of ARI, including pneumonia, among military trainees are
well documented (3,4). Factors that might contribute to increased ARI
susceptibility in this population include the rapid gathering of
persons from across the country into crowded living and working
quarters, which exposes nonimmune persons to several pathogens, and
the physical and psychological stressors of training. Disease
prevention efforts include immunoprophylaxis (e.g., pneumococcal,
meningococcal, and influenza vaccinations) and chemoprophylaxis
(e.g., penicillin prophylaxis for streptococcal infections)
administered to incoming recruits (3) and ongoing surveillance for
ARI (4).
A leading cause of bacterial ARI among military recruits is _S.
pyogenes_ or GAS, which manifests as outbreaks of GAS pharyngitis,
acute rheumatic fever, and pneumonia (3). This outbreak involved the
circulation of a single GAS serotype and probably evolved from the
introduction of this strain into a population of recruits lacking
type-specific immunity. Streptococcal emm type 3 (corresponding to M
type 3) is one of the most common serotypes associated with invasive
GAS disease in the United States (5,6) and has been associated
frequently, along with M types 1, 5, and 18, with outbreaks among
U.S. military recruits (3). Population-based surveillance for all
invasive GAS infections in 9 disparate locations in the United States
indicated that pneumonia accounted for 11-14 percent of reported
cases and was the third most common syndrome after invasive cutaneous
or soft tissue infections and bacteremia without a known source
(5,6). Among the civilian population, outbreaks of GAS pneumonia are
rare. A higher baseline rate of invasive and noninvasive GAS disease
and a potential to delay seeking medical treatment for minor illness
(including pharyngitis) among military recruit populations might
account for this difference.
Several pathogens were identified as the potential source of
pneumonia among the 78 (61 percent) pneumonia episodes for which a
causative agent could be identified, and several pneumonia patients
had dual diagnoses. Whether this represents a true concurrent
increase in multiple respiratory pathogens or is an artifact of the
diagnostic testing methods used is uncertain.
The findings in this report are subject to at least 3 limitations.
First, a definitive diagnosis of GAS pneumonia is difficult. Blood
cultures frequently are negative in GAS pneumonia (2); therefore, a
confirmed diagnosis might not be possible unless pleural fluid is
obtained. Second, because positive throat or sputum cultures can
represent simple GAS pharyngitis or asymptomatic carriage of the
organism, the specificity of these cultures for diagnosis of GAS
pneumonia is low. Rising ASO titers might distinguish between GAS
carriage and infection but are not specific for invasive GAS disease
(7). Finally, diagnosing _M. pneumoniae_ and _C. pneumoniae_
infections by serology alone can be problematic, especially in the
context of known GAS infections. Several serologic assays for _M.
pneumoniae_ are available commercially but vary in sensitivity and
specificity (8). Although the microimmunofluorescence assay is
considered the method of choice for serologic diagnosis of _C.
pneumoniae_ infection, interpretation of the results can be
subjective. False positives can occur for _M. pneumoniae_ and
possibly for _C. pneumoniae_ serologic assays in the presence of a
nonspecific antibody response to GAS infection.
Primary and secondary penicillin chemoprophylaxis for GAS infections
is effective in military recruit populations and has been used
intermittently since 1951 (3,4). Primary (i.e., tandem) prophylaxis
is administered to all recruits shortly after their arrival at a
training facility to prevent the introduction of GAS into this
population, and secondary (i.e., mass) prophylaxis is provided
concurrently to all recruits in a given facility to interrupt
established disease transmission. Oral erythromycin or azithromycin
prophylaxis is used to prevent infection among recruits who are
allergic to penicillin. The reason that primary prophylaxis failed in
this circumstance is unclear. Possible explanations include failure
to achieve adequate serum levels of penicillin (9), waning protection
as serum levels declined before the second scheduled dose of
penicillin was administered on training day 28, and lack of
compliance with oral erythromycin among penicillin-allergic recruits.
Eradicating GAS carriage is difficult even with appropriate doses of
penicillin and in the absence of penicillin resistance (10).
Early diagnosis and management of GAS infections might prevent the
development of suppurative complications. Routine surveillance for
noninvasive GAS disease was initiated recently at MCRD to identify
breakthrough GAS infections and prevent outbreaks of GAS disease.
Institution of routine surveillance for noninvasive GAS disease also
might be useful for other military training facilities.
