07/03/09, 07/06/09, 07/10/09, and 07/14/09.

06/30/09, 07/03/09, 07/07/09, 07/10/09, and 07/11/09.

The ground beef products were produced on various dates ranging from
5 Jun 2009 through 23 Jun 2009 and bear the establishment number
"EST. 31913" printed on the case code labels. The ground beef
products were distributed to retail distribution centers in Arizona,
California, Colorado, and Utah. Because these products were
repackaged into consumer-size packages and sold under different
retail brand names, consumers should check with their local retailer
to determine whether they may have purchased any of the products
subject to recall.

As a result of an ongoing investigation into an outbreak of
_Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Newport associated with ground beef
products, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment
(CDPHE) notified FSIS of the situation. Epidemiological and traceback
investigations conducted by FSIS and CDPHE determined that there is
an association between the fresh ground beef products and illnesses
reported in Colorado. The illnesses were also linked through the
epidemiological investigation by their uncommon pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern found in PulseNet, a national network
of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

FSIS would like to remind consumers of the importance of following
food safety guidelines when handling and preparing raw meat. Ground
beef should be cooked to a safe minimum internal temperature of 160
deg F [71 deg C].

This particular strain of _S._ Newport is resistant to many commonly
prescribed drugs, which can increase the risk of hospitalization or
possible treatment failure in infected individuals.

[The following recommendations for preventing salmonellosis were
contained in a side bar to the alert above:

Wash hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds before and
after handling raw meat and poultry. Also wash cutting boards, dishes
and utensils with hot soapy water. Clean up spills right away.

Keep raw meat, fish, and poultry away from other food that will not
be cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry, and egg
products and cooked foods.

Cook raw meat and poultry to safe internal temperatures before
eating. The safe internal temperature for meat such as beef and pork
is 160 deg F [71 deg C], and 165 deg F [74 deg C] for poultry, as
determined with a food thermometer.

Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within 2 hours after purchase (1
hour if temperatures exceed 90 deg F [32 deg C]). Refrigerate cooked
meat and poultry within 2 hours after cooking. - Mod.LL]
