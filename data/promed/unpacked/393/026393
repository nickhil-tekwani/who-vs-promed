https://www.dawn.com/news/1393132/2-children-die-in-nawabshah-after-being-administered-allegedly-expired-anti-measles-vaccines


Three children died, and at least 3 others were hospitalised in critical condition in Nawabshah, allegedly after being administered expired measles vaccines on Sat [3 Mar 2018], according to hospital officials and family members.

Three children [ages 5, 6 and 9 months] died at the Paediatrics Unit of Peoples University Medical Hospital (PUMH), while 3 other children, [ages 5, 4, and 3] were said to be in serious condition.

Junior doctors at PUMH who are treating the patients believe that expired vaccines are the reason behind the deaths, but district health officials have denied that the administered vaccines were expired and have ordered an inquiry into the matter.

The officials said that samples had been collected from the bodies of the affected children for testing, and that nothing could be said about the reasons behind the deaths as yet.

The parents of the deceased children alleged that a lady health worker visited their homes in the Saeedabad area on Saturday [3 Mar 2018] and administered anti-measles vaccines against their will.

They claimed that the woman had not followed proper protocol, as she took the vaccines and injections out from her purse and administered doses to the children. They added that the vaccines were past their expiry [expiration] date.

The children fell ill after the vaccine was administered and were taken to a private hospital. They were later shifted to PUMH, but a lack of immediate medical attention led to 3 of the 6 children losing their lives.

Residents of Mouhalla Saeedabad in Old Nawabshah staged a protest against the Health Department and demanded immediate action against those responsible for the negligence.

Police subsequently took the lady health worker administering the allegedly expired vaccines into custody for investigation. A case has yet to be registered, but a complaint may be filed once medical reports are issued, police said.

Commissioner Shaheed Benazirabad Ghulam Mustafa Phull has set up 2 different committees to investigate the matter.

Speaking to Dawn, Phull said that an inquiry is being conducted by the Health Department to check whether there was any negligence on the part of staff, while a separate investigation would be conducted in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO).

He said that he had visited PUMH where the children were admitted and had ordered the deputy commissioner to make arrangements for provision of the best facilities and to shift the affected children to Karachi.

He said that although there was no way to compensate the loss of lives of the children, he would recommend the Sindh government provide compensation to their families.

A reliable source in the Nawabshah Health Department told Dawn that health officials show little concern regarding international standards and protocols regarding vaccinations, including the maintenance of required temperature, possibly leading to a drop in efficacy of the vaccine as well as adverse effects.

Meanwhile, Deputy Commissioner Shaheed Benazirabad Nauman Siddiq Latki reached PUMH and supervised the shifting of the 3 children to Aga Khan Hospital, Karachi.

He told Dawn that the condition of the children was critical and there was no facility of Paediatric ICU in Nawabshah, after which a decision was taken by the doctors to shift them to Karachi so that they receive the best treatment and facilities to ensure safety of their lives.

He further said that the children were moved along with their families and that the government of Sindh would bear all expenses.

[It is unclear why these children died or became severely ill following vaccination. According to the WHO, "improperly stored or expired vaccine seldom if ever causes a toxic reaction." No toxic reaction means that the child is very unlikely to get sick as a result of receiving the expired or improperly stored vaccine. If the vaccine vial or prefilled syringe is not damaged, it is extremely unlikely that the vaccine will become contaminated by improper storage. However, if the vaccine had lost potency due to expiration or improper handling, the child could be harmed if he or she gets infected later in life because the impotent vaccine provided no protection from the disease for which the vaccine was intended. This situation would be the same as if the child had never received the vaccine [http://www.wpro.who.int/china/mediacentre/releases/2016/20160322/en/]. - Mod.LK

As many as 8 children have died from the vaccine-preventable disease measles in Sindh province, while more than 100 others were also affected from this disease this year [2018] so far.

Sindh Health Services Director General Dr Akhlaq Khan said 8 children have already died of measles in the province so far, of which 4 deaths were reported from Badin and 4 from suburban areas of Hyderabad. He said these deaths were confirmed after clinical investigation.

Dr Khan said although all vaccines are available at the vaccination centres throughout province, unfortunately, a large section of the population was unaware and careless of protecting the new generation through proper vaccination consumption despite availability free-of-cost.

He said a 7-member committee constituted by the Sindh Health Department to probe the deaths of 3 children and the matter of severe illness of 6 other children will submit its report soon to the health department.

Experts say that measles is an airborne disease which spreads easily through the coughs and sneezes of those infected and that fever, dry cough, runny nose, sore throat, inflamed eyes, tiny white spots with bluish-white centers on a red background found inside the mouth on the inner lining of the cheek are some major symptoms of disease.

An outbreak of measles has hit 7 towns in Negro Oriental, its Integrated Provincial Health Office (IPHO) confirmed Mon [5 Mar 2018].

Among the affected areas were Bacong, Dumaguete City, Mabinay, San Jose, Santa Catalina, Siaton and Valencia, Dr. Leilan Estacion of the IPHO said in a phone interview with ABS-CBN News.

There have been no measles-related deaths in these areas so far, she said.

Measles is an infectious disease that can cause death among infants as young as 3 months old. Colder temperatures typically cause a spike in cases of the illness, symptoms of which include skin rashes and fever, authorities have said.

The Department of Health also confirmed measles outbreaks in a Taguig village last week and in Davao City last month.

Davao City had seen a decrease in the number of children vaccinated against measles following a public health scare triggered by the scrapped dengue immunization program, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said in February 2018.

https://112.international/society/about-6500-people-infected-with-measles-in-ukraine-in-2018-26311.html


About 6500 people were infected with measles in Ukraine since the beginning of 2018, Viktor Lyashko, the Deputy Director-General on Supervision over Infectious Diseases of the Public Health Centre of Ukraine's Healthcare Ministry, reported.

"As at 6 Mar 2018, 684 people, including 266 adults and 418 children, were sickened with measles during the 9th week of 2018, and it is 12% less than the previous week. Totally, 6484 cases of the measles were spotted since the beginning of 2018, 2226 adults and 4258 children," he noted.

According to Lyashko, 4421 people were hospitalized. Seven people died: 5 of them were children and 2 adults.

"Five people died in Odesa region, one in Ivano-Frankivsk region and one more in Zakarpattia region," he said.

Lyashko claimed that most people infected with the measles [were from] Ivano-Frankivsk region, with 1426 people, and Zakarpattia region, with 1138 people. Kharkiv region had the least, with only 2 cases spotted.

Earlier, the European Health Security Agency reported that Ukraine was the 3rd in Europe with the number of people infected with measles in 2017. The leaders are Romania and Italy.

[There has been some discussion in the Ukraine press on whether the circulating genotype of measles is more virulent. "A dangerous genotype of the measles virus B3 (Kabul) is circulating in Odesa region, as stated in the Odesa Regional State Administration press release. People from the other regions of Ukraine are infected with European samples of the D8 virus. And only in Odesa region, in addition to the D3 genotype, the B3 (Kabul) is fixed. It is characterized by high pathogenicity and virulence. Its aggressiveness gives a high incidence and lethality. The results are approved by the special laboratory researches in Copenhagen," the report says. ... According to the latest data, 6 genotypes of measles are circulating in Ukraine. The genotype matters when we assess the situation from which country the strain was brought; we have measles strains brought from Singapore: D8, D4, D3. Genotypes were imported from Romania, Bulgaria, and Georgia, Demchyshyna said" (excerpted from https://112.international/article/measles-genotype-b3-kabul-found-in-odesa-region-is-this-type-the-deadliest-one-25521.html).

However, it really is lack of vaccination that is the problem. The measles genotype does not have an impact on the lethality or complications. The measles virus has a single serotype, although 23 genotypes have been identified by analysis of the sequences of the nucleoprotein (N) and hemagglutinin (H) genes. Infection by any genotype induces life-long immunity against all genotypes. No genotype has been associated with greater virulence or persistence. Some genotypes may be associated with specific geographic regions, although the majority cause outbreaks and sporadic cases in any country (excerpted from MM Mosquera et al. The Open Vaccine Journal, 2010, 3, 76-85 https://benthamopen.com/contents/pdf/TOVACJ/TOVACJ-3-76.pdf).

[5] Peru alert

The Peru Ministry of Health has issued a health alert due to a confirmed measles case in a 46-year-old man who lives in Callao, according to an El Comercio report (computer translated).

The patient visited Puno for the feast of the Virgen de la Candelaria. Upon returning from the trip, he presented with measles symptoms.

The National Center for Epidemiology, Prevention and Control of Diseases (CDC Peru) of Minsa and the Directorate of Epidemiology of Callao investigated the case.

The affected person is in quarantine, and "vaccine blockade" has been carried out in 5 blocks around the house, in the area known as Boterín.

Peru officials note that the country has been free of measles transmission since 2001.

"In recent years, there have been a few imported cases of measles (the contagion occurred in another country) that were identified and controlled immediately to avoid contagion to other people," they said. This is the 1st time that the contagion occurred within the country.

Measles is one of the most contagious diseases and affects primarily children. It is transmitted by airborne droplets or via direct contact with secretions from the nose, mouth, and throat of infected individuals. Symptoms include high fever, generalized rash all over the body, stuffy nose, and reddened eyes. It can cause serious complications including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, ear infections and pneumonia, particularly in children with nutritional problems and in immunocompromised patients.

http://outbreaknewstoday.com/brazil-reports-measles-venezuelan-refugees-75085/


A 4-year-old Venezuelan child suspected of having measles and pneumonia died on 2 Mar 2018 at the Children's Hospital in Boa Vista, according to the city of Boa Vista. She was among the 12 cases investigated for suspected measles, according to a g1.globo report (computer translated).

According to the city hall, the child came a few days ago from the city of Pacaraima, on the border with Venezuela, and entered the children's hospital of Boa Vista in poor health and with suspected measles.

Samples were taken for analysis, and the child was isolated because measles is a contagious disease. Six children have already been diagnosed with the disease in Boa Vista.

In addition, 6 cases of measles in Venezuelan children were confirmed in Roraima in northern Brazil.

For the period January 2017-2018, 952 measles cases were reported in Venezuela (732 by laboratory and 220 by epidemiological link), according to UN officials.

[According to humanitarian officials, an estimated 500 000 Venezuelans have fled the country since the beginning of the year, with a large percentage taking refuge in Colombia and Brazil. The migrant crisis is expected to worsen throughout 2018 as Venezuela's economy continues to falter. At least 10 percent of the population of Boa Vista, the capital of Roraima state, are now Venezuelan migrants.

Some seek protection there as refugees, others seek temporary work, while others make visits seeking desperately needed medical care. The unprecedented influx of Venezuelans is straining Roraima's already overburdened public health care system.

Health officials are on alert as of early March 2018 due to fears of a possible measles outbreak in Roraima state amid an influx of Venezuelan refugees. According to local sources, 12 suspected cases of measles amid Venezuelan refugees, including one death, were being investigated as of Mon 5 Mar 2018.

Enhanced public health measures, including vaccination campaigns, have been implemented throughout the region to stem the spread of the disease. (Excerpted from https://www.garda.com/crisis24/news-alerts/95871/brazil-fears-of-measles-outbreak-amid-influx-of-venezuelan-refugees.)
