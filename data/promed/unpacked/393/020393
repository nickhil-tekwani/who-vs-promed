Outbreak of anthrax kills 2 people
----------------------------------
A total of 2 people are reported dead as a result of an outbreak of anthrax in the Upper East Region. The deaths occurred at Googo after consuming a dead animal believed to have been infected with the disease.

The regional veterinary officer, Dr Thomas Anyarikeya, who disclosed this to GBC's Radio Ghana said anthrax is a life threatening infectious disease that affect animals especially ruminants and could be transmitted to humans as well.

[The true livestock incidence in Ghana is nearer sporadic but vaccination compliance is not as strong as the government veterinary strives for, and folk insist on eating their dead animals. So these 2 human cases are unfortunately very typical. Bovine outbreaks occurred in the Upper East Province in 2005 (1), 2006 (2), 2008 (2), and 2009 (1, plus 2 outbreaks involving sheep and goats); none were reported in this province in 2011. In 2006 there were human cases in Upper East Province with 4 deaths; in 2008 there were 3 deaths but the number of cases was not specified; in 2009 there were 9 cases with 2 deaths.

In spite of its small size this province has more than its share of livestock and human cases. This probably reflects a lack of success in getting the owners to vaccinate their stock, which is always a problem wherever you are in the world, when the incidence is sporadic. Unfortunately it carries a high human cost.
