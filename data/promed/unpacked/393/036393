Two dairy farms in Belgium have experience mortality from an unknown
disease. Symptoms start with bloody diarrhoea and include paralysis and
lung disease, according to media reports. The first affected farm located
in Meetjesland, east Flanders, was first detected on December 2. Several
cows developed bloody diarrhoea, followed by signs of paralysis and lung
disorders. The first mortality occurred on December 5 and a total of two
cows died on the farm at Meetjesland. Presently, the rest of the herd at
this farm appear to be healthy and continue to produce milk for market.
Tests for poisons, pesticides, bacteria and parasites were all negative.
The Belgium Agriculture Minister, Jaak Gabriels has now shut down a second
farm at Zwalm where 8 cows have died showing similar symptoms. The whole
herd will be slaughtered. In an attempt to increase surveillance, a letter
has been sent to all veterinarians in the country asking them to report any
herds shows signs similar to this disease.

[While it never wise to second guess animal health officials who have
access to reams of information that these news stories do not convey, I
must confess a certain level of concern. Maybe it is the way the Belgium
dioxin crisis was handled or maybe it is just an utter lack of detail in
the news reports, but there do seem to be some questions which should be
answered.
First, what are the clinical signs? Has a case definition for the outbreak
been formulated and what is the case definition? Are the "paralysis" and
"lung disease" secondary to diarrhea as the cows get too weak to stand?
This sometimes occurs with recumbent cows. Or are the paralytic and
respiratory symptoms occurring from the onset of the syndrome?
Secondly, why are the unaffected animals in the second herd being
slaughtered while the unaffected and recovered animals in the first herd
are producing milk for human consumption? Just knowing how large the herd
size is would be great so that even basic information on within herd
mortality could be available. More disease control questions could be
asked but what would be helpful at this point would be details and
definitive information. - Mod.PC

Belgian officials have raided a factory that supplied sugarbeet pulp to two
dairy farms where a mysterious disease has killed 10 cows, the Agriculture
Ministry said on Wednesday. "Court and ministry officials went to the
factory yesterday. They searched it," Agriculture Ministry spokeswoman
Sigrid Gevaerts told [news media. "It doesn't mean there's anything wrong
with the beet. It's a routine procedure," she added.
Gevaerts said officials from the ministry and Ghent Public Prosecutors
Office raided a sugar factory at Moerbeke, near Ghent in northwest Belgium,
which is owned by privately held Suikergroep. The Moerbeke plant is one of
two factories owned by Suikergroep which supplied sugarbeet pulp to the two
dairy farms whose cows have been hit by the mysterious illness.
Gevaerts said she could not confirm Belgian media reports that the raid was
to seek a list of the factory's clients. The Ghent Prosecutors Office
declined to comment on the search.
Agriculture Minister Jaak Gabriels said on Monday that 10 cows at two dairy
farms had died since early December from a mysterious illness whose
symptoms included bloody diarrhoea, paralysis and lung disorders. Gabriels
on Monday had said the sugarbeet pulp feed was a likely cause of the deadly
illness but later said that tests on samples had proved negative.
Moerbeke and a second Suikergroep factory at Frasnes in the southern,
French-speaking Wallonia both supplied feed to a farm in Meetjesland, east
Flanders, where several cows developed bloody diarrhoea in December. Two
cows there later died.
The factories also supplied a second farm at Zwalm, where another eight
cows died after showing similar symptoms. Gabriels said on Monday the farm
at Zwalm had been shut down and its entire herd would be slaughtered. The
ministry said the Meetjesland farm remains open and producing milk because
all the surviving cows now show no signs of illness.
Pathologists at the University of Ghent examined the cow carcasses but all
tests for poison, pesticide, bacteria, parasites and other contaminants had
drawn a blank by Wednesday.
The mysterious illness comes less than a year after the dioxin-in-food
crisis raised fears about food safety. Last year the Ghent Public
Prosecutor's Office had been responsible for tracing the dioxin crisis to
animal fats producer Verkest and animal fats supplier Fogra. The dioxin
crisis, which broke in late May, seriously dented Belgium's economy,
stripping grocery shelves bare and prompting countries around the world to
ban Belgian food imports for fear of the cancer-causing chemical.
