Sri Lanka
- National. 3 Jan 2018. In 2017, Sri Lanka saw a record number of dengue fever cases with a total of 184 442, a total more than 3 times higher than in 2016. More than 320 deaths were also reported. The dengue peak was observed during the summer months with more than 41 000 cases reported during July alone. Colombo RDHS [Regional Directorate of Health Services] and Gampaha RDHS saw the most cases, with 34 173 and 31 459, respectively. To put the 2017 epidemic in perspective, there were 55 000 cases reported in 2016 and about 30 000 cases seen in 2015. While dengue was reported from all over the island, approximately 41.53 percent of cases were reported from the Western province. All 4 serotypes of dengue have been seen in Sri Lanka. The current outbreak is predominantly due to serotype 2 (DEN-2), which is not the usual type circulating in Sri Lanka.

India
- Maharashtra (Pune). 4 Jan 2018. 15 suspected cases of dengue reported in Pune in 3 days. The number is expected to reduce with decrease in temperature. In 2017 1691 confirmed cases were reported. According to officials, over 41 489 dengue sites were found and treated with insecticides by the department as a measure to prevent the growing number of dengue patients in the city since the outbreak in June [2017].

- New Delhi. 22 Jan 2018. At least 3 people have already been diagnosed with dengue in Delhi. These are the 1st reported cases this year [2018].

Cases of vector-borne diseases are usually reported between mid-July and November-end, but this period may stretch up to mid-December. "3 cases of dengue have been reported till [20 Jan 2018]. However, no cases of malaria or chikungunya have been reported," according to a municipal report released today [22 Jan 2018]. There was no case of any vector-borne disease till [13 Jan 2018].

Pakistan
- Sindh (Karachi). 15 Jan 2018. As many as 24 more dengue fever cases were reported throughout Karachi last week [week of 8 Jan 2018], taking the number of reported cases to 47 in the city since 1 Jan 2018. As per the weekly report issued by the Prevention and Control Program for Dengue in Sindh, at least 24 new dengue fever cases surfaced across the city [during 8-15 Jan 2018]. A total of 48 cases have been reported throughout Sindh province, out of which 47 were in Karachi and one from the rest of the province.

In 2017, a total of 2927 dengue cases were reported across Sindh province, out of which 12 died from this fever.

- Maldives. 17 Jan 2018. Health Protection Agency (HPA) has confirmed the number of dengue fever cases reported is comparatively more than the total number of cases reported during the same period of 2017. The 1st portion of each year is active with dengue fever cases reported throughout Maldives. To counter this and raise awareness and promote safety, HPA had initiated special camps last week[week of 8 Jan 2018]. Maldives has reported little over 2000 cases of dengue fever patients in the past 2 years.

- Russia ex Egypt (Hurghada, Red Sea). 19 Jan 2018. In 2017, 2 cases of dengue fever were imported from Hurghada, Egypt, where dengue fever was not considered endemic, to Moscow. These cases show how emergence of dengue fever in popular resort regions on the coast of the Red Sea can spread infection to countries where it is not endemic.

- Thailand. 21 Jan 2018. Chulalongkorn University says that 80 percent of dengue patients don't show symptoms, making the disease more dangerous and sometimes fatal. Teerapong Tantawichien, MD, Professor of Medicine of the Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University said there are no fewer than 100 000 cases of dengue fever reported every year in Thailand and 70-80 percent of those cases did not exhibit symptoms which can include high fever, rashes, and muscle and joint pain, headache, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. A dengue vaccine is 65 percent effective among those who have contracted the disease before, he said, adding that 80 percent of vaccinated persons can avoid hospital admission and up to 93 percent don't experience severe symptoms. He cautioned however that those who haven't been infected with the virus and decide to get vaccinated will have a greater risk of encountering severe symptoms if they actually come down with the disease. He has advised all hospitals to inspect personal medical records before giving out dengue vaccines.

- Samoa. 4 Jan 2018. Dengue fever continues to be a problem in Samoa. In fact, the Director of the Ministry of Health, Leausa Dr Take Naseri, said they have recorded a steady increase in the number of dengue fever cases in the past months, since the 1st case was identified on 27 Oct 2017. "Of all cases diagnosed and reported (clinical and confirmed), males comprised 51 percent (920) of the total, compared to 49 percent (868) of females. "The age group affected is between 1-19 years of age with a national attack rate of 9.3 percent per 1000 people." The majority of the 1788 cases reported to date are from Faleata, Vaimauga, Gagaemauga (Leauva'a), and the Sagaga districts.

[2] Philippines: dengue after vaccination
Date: Tue 2 Jan 2018
Source: Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) [edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/01/three-filipino-children-hospitalized-after-receiving-dengvaxia


According to a story today [2 Jan 2018] in the Manila Times, 3 children recently immunized with Dengvaxia, Sanofi Pasteur's dengue vaccine, are now hospitalized with possible dengue infections.

In related news, a new study shows that receipt of Dengvaxia may affect the accuracy of dengue diagnostic tests [see below].

The hospitalizations come one month after Sanofi recommended Dengvaxia not be used in anyone who is dengue-naive. In recipients without previous dengue infections, the vaccine can lead to more severe illness.

According to Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption (VACC), a non-profit offering free legal assistance to families whose children received Dengvaxia, an 11-, 14-, and 16-year-old were admitted to the Philippine Children's Medical Center on Dec 31 after exhibiting dengue symptoms.

The children received Dengvaxia in the last months of 2017, with the 11-year-old girl completing all 3 shots included of the vaccination. She and the 16-year-old boy, who are from the same village, complained of abdominal discomfort after getting the shots, the Manila Times reported.

The 14-year-old, a boy, received 2 vaccine doses in October [2017].

Dante Jimenez, founding chairman of the VACC, said his group is urging the government to release the names of all children who've received Dengvaxia, but he said the government has not responded to his request.

So far, at least 2 deaths in Filipino children have been linked to Dengvaxia. In both cases, school-aged girls who were dengue-naive developed severe dengue infections shortly after receiving the vaccine.

[3] Dengue testing after Dengvaxia
Date: Tue 2 Jan 2018
Source: Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) [edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/01/three-filipino-children-hospitalized-after-receiving-dengvaxia


A study published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases (1) suggests there is a need for new, more specific dengue tests that can accurately identify the difference between dengue infection and antibodies produced by the dengue vaccine.

The study examined febrile illnesses in people from 10 countries in Latin America and Asia where Dengvaxia had been used in the previous 25 months. The researchers identified 1284 virologically confirmed cases of dengue, and 17 673 other febrile episodes labeled as "probable dengue." Dengue infection was determined using immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM assays.

Patients who had the dengue vaccine in the previous 25 months were much more likely to get false-positive dengue diagnoses. There was a 2.2-fold higher proportion of positive samples in the Dengvaxia group than in the controls when using IgM assays, and 3.4-fold higher proportion when using IgG tests.

"Overall positive and negative predictive values were 22.9 percent and 99.5 percent, respectively, reflecting the much lower probability of correctly confirming probable dengue in a population including a vaccinated cohort," the authors said.

In an accompanying commentary (2), Graham Simmons, PhD, and colleagues who were not involved in the study wrote that flavivirus serology is a difficult field because of the cross-reactivity of the viruses and the possibility for re-infection.

[4] Research: Immune evasion by dengue virus
Date: Wed 24 Jan 2018
Source: The Chronicle [edited]
http://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2018/01/the-perfect-trojan-horse-how-the-dengue-virus-may-covertly-evade-immune-systems


Although many diseases infect the body and overpower the immune system with speed and sheer force, the dengue virus seems to take a different approach, according to new Duke research.

Christopher Nicchitta, professor of cell biology and biochemistry and associate professor of pathology, is the senior author of a recent study showing how the virus covertly replicates in humans without triggering the immune system. The trick to evading detection, his team showed, is for the virus to hide and stealthily overtake a major protein production site for the cell, called the endoplasmic reticulum.

"[Dengue] is a very real health problem," Nicchitta said. "After billions of viruses and hundreds of millions of years, it has evolved to where it replicates very slowly to accomplish its goal of spreading." Dengue -- a lethal virus with no medical cure -- has a slow-replicating, tiny genome that can lead to excruciatingly painful symptoms in patients.

This virus spans over Central and South America, regions of Africa, and South Asia and has become more common in United States territories of the past few years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Due to increased temperatures from global warming, the region in which the mosquitoes that carry dengue inhabit is expanding, consequently increasing the virus's range. Part of this global expansion has included urban centers, Nicchitta noted.

"The mosquito that carries the virus is very well adapted to live in urban environments," he said. "This is the easiest way to transfer the disease -- in a very crowded place."

The danger with this virus is that it replicates inside the host cells of the body undetected until it becomes large enough to cause problems. By the time the body notices its invader, the virus has already multiplied and infected the host.

"It is sort of the perfect Trojan horse," Nicchitta said. "It goes in, slowly takes over, emergency sensing systems aren't turning on, and the protein sensing networks aren't seeing a problem." Apart from the symptoms that are associated with dengue fever, the virus is also a menace for its variability, he noted. With four serotypes -- which are variations of the virus -- it has the ability to infect a host more than once.

"If you contract a different serotype of dengue, your immune system will now recognize it... the antibodies produced by your immune system will bind to the dengue virus and actually help it get into cells," Nicchitta said. Pathogens such as the virus associated with chickenpox lead to an immune reaction such that secondary exposure to a similar virus typically does not lead to serious infection. However, with dengue, he said, a secondary infection is accompanied by a much more severe immune response and can lead to death.

There is currently no cure for the virus. Although a vaccine designed to prevent dengue once existed, the supposed cure did more harm than good, Nicchitta explained. He added that the group's findings could one day lead to stopping the virus in its tracks.

"We are really interested in understanding how it is not turning on [the body's] stress sensors," Nicchitta said. "Maybe this is just a general strategy, and if it is, then we want to figure that out, understand how it is able to do that, and see if there is a way to therapeutically disrupt that."
