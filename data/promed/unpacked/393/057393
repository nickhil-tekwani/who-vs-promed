Ponoka County has now found 2 fields contaminated with clubroot, a
disease which ravages canola. Shayne Steffen, the county's manager of
agriculture services, said the 2 fields are located east of Highway 2
and were identified during an ongoing inspection program. "We're
still doing more surveying right now," said Steffen on Thursday [4
Sep 2008]. University of Alberta agriculture experts are also helping
by doing pathology tests on the clubroot to identify what strain it
is and perhaps provide clues to how it got to Central Alberta.

Steffen said a university expert was in the area on Wednesday [3 Sep
2008] to look at the infestations. The size of the areas of diseased
crops suggested the spores that cause clubroot had likely been in the
ground for up to 5 years. The infestations were found in the strips
around the edges of the fields where farmers make their 1st passes
with equipment. Clubroot infestations are typically found near the
edges of fields and at entry points and the disease is often
transported on farm equipment.

Eleven other Alberta counties have also confirmed the presence of the
disease. Most are in the Edmonton area, where clubroot was first
identified in a commercial canola operation in 2003. Lacombe County
agriculture fieldman Dion Burlock said the inspections are ongoing
but so far no further infestations have been found. Steffen said,
"Quarantining the field is a good way to manage the infestation." He
plans to continue his spot checks, but it is impossible to check all
of the county's 700 000 acres [283 280 ha] of fields.

Clubroot is worrying for Canadian farmers because the type of canola
grown in this country is particularly susceptible to the disease. It
is a serious soil-borne disease that causes galls to form on canola
roots, which ultimately causes premature death of the plant. There
are no economical control measures that can remove the disease from a
canola field once it has been infected. The best methods of
preventing its spread are increasing canola crop rotations and
ensuring farm equipment is cleaned before moving to a new field.

[Clubroot of _Brassicaceae_ is caused by the fungus _Plasmodiophora
brassicae_. It is a destructive soil-borne disease, which affects
nearly all cultivated and many wild and weed members of this family,
as well as some weed species in different families. The pathogen is
found worldwide and is most damaging in temperate regions and
tropical highlands. Symptoms on brassicas may include stunting and
discoloured leaves as well as distortion and decay of roots. The
fungus has a complex disease cycle and is spread with contaminated
soil, plant material, water, and by human activities. Disease
management is difficult due to the longevity of the spores and the
inaccessibility of underground plant parts to fungicides. Numerous
pathotypes exist, and this has hampered efforts to breed cultivars
with durable resistance. For more information on the disease please
