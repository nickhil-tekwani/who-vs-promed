Dubious vaccine sickens 50 students in Anhui
--------------------------------------------
More than 50 students at a primary school in Sixian County, east China's
Anhui Province, reported symptoms of illness, including vomiting, dizziness
and limb feebleness, about 3 hours after they were injected with Hepatitis
A vaccines last Friday [24 Jun 2005]. By Sunday afternoon, the students,
had not yet recovered from the illness, and at least 30 of them were
hospitalized. Local doctors considered the students' ailments normal
allergic symptoms, and began to use antibiotics on the children.

The hepatitis A vaccine concerned has been sent to Hefei, capital of the
province, for examination. Experts in Anhui and nearby Jiangsu Province
have been invited to the county to assist in the medical treatment of the
ill students.

3 detained over vaccine accident in Eastern China
-------------------------------------------------
3 health workers have been detained over the vaccine accident which killed
one child and sickened 120 others in Sixian County in east China's Anhui
Province.

The 3 people are the director of Dazhuang Township Hospital, the head of
the Dazhuang Town Health Care and Epidemic Prevention Station, and a health
worker who purchased the involved hepatitis A vaccines.

Without official permission, the town epidemic prevention station organized
village doctors to vaccinate about 2500 students in 19 schools in 17
villages on 16 and 17 Jun [2005] according to local police. Several
students reported dizziness, breathing difficulties, and limb numbness on
the morning of Fri 17 Jun [2005]. Local hospitals had received 121 sickened
students by Friday, including a 6 year old pupil who died on Thursday.

The town epidemic prevention station purchased 1000 hepatitis A vaccines
from the county epidemic prevention center and 3000 others from a private
medicine provider, who disappeared after the accident.

Local police are still hunting for [the private medicine provider], and
tracing down sources of the vaccines. The rest of the vaccines have been
sealed, and the samples were sent to a state institution for testing.

120 pupils sick, one dead after dubious vaccination
---------------------------------------------------
A 6 year old girl died and at least 121 school children became sick after
getting dubious vaccinations in eastern China's Anhui Province, a hospital
source said Saturday [25 Jun 2005].

Without approval from local health and education departments, the epidemic
prevention center in Dazhuang Town of Sixian County inoculated more than
2500 children in 19 primary and middle schools with bacterin [vaccine]
against hepatitis A on Thu 16 and Fri 17 Jun [2005]. The girl died in a
local hospital on Thursday afternoon after exhibiting fever, diarrhea and
trembling.

Experts of the provincial sanitation department said at the end of an
initial probe that the girl died of serious infection and respiration
failure. Legal medical experts from the provincial medical institute
dissected her body Fri 17 Jun 2005 afternoon, but no outcome has been
available so far.

To console the girl's parents and other close relatives, the relevant local
government departments in the county have reached an agreement to pay the
girl's family 190 000 yuan (some USD 10 840) in compensation.

Other school kids, aged about 7 to 14, are still undergoing intensive
medical care in the hospital, and 20 of them remain in critical condition,
according to doctors.

Pan Longgen, the physician-in-charge with the Sixian People's Hospital,
said the ailing students' hearts and livers have been harmed to varying
degrees. But so far, there has been found no effective treatment, he added.

The bacterin [vaccine] has been sent to the Chinese Ministry of Public
Health for testing, and the outcome is expected to be available in about 10
days.

[According to the newswires presented above, there appears to be an adverse
event/clustering associated with the administration of hepatitis A vaccine
in Anhui Province. Reading the 1st 2 newswire reports above, one wondered
whether there was a death in a child about one day after the vaccination
(from a potentially unrelated cause) and then the onset of a possible
mass-hysteria associated with that death, with symptoms being non-specific
such as vomiting, dizziness, and limb weakness, which may be symptoms seen
with hyperventilation as a panic-type reaction. The 3rd newswire appears
more sobering, as the description includes heart and liver abnormalities in
an additional 20 children who are still hospitalized in critical condition.
It is very difficult to draw conclusions as to what may be going on, and
ProMED-mail is requesting more information from authoritative sources on
this event.

In the "see also" section below, there are prior ProMED-mail postings
related to vaccine specific events. In some instances, adverse events were
associated with vaccination activities that were probably due to local
events, such as local contamination of vaccine vials or use of incorrect
diluent for reconstitution of lyophilized vaccines (lyophilized vaccines
are freeze dried vaccines that require reconstitution through the addition
of diluents). In other cases below, vaccines have been recalled by the
manufacturer for issues related to the content of the vaccine (in the case
of the hepatitis A vaccine recall, it was for substandard potency of the
vaccine released). In the above reports, the mention of some of the vaccine
having been provided by a private supplier raises the question of whether
the vaccine provided by this supplier was subjected to the rigorous control
messages of national and international standards, or whether this is
mentioned only to provide a temporary scapegoat for this apparently
unfortunate event. Information from authoritative sources on the results of
the vaccine testing would be appreciated as well. - Mod.MPP]
