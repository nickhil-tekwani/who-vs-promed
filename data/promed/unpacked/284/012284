Avian die-off - Sweden: RFI 20010811.1901

From: Torsten Morner <Torsten.Morner@sva.se>

Increased mortality among waterfowl, [mostly herring-gulls (_Larus
argentatus_) has been observed in Swedish coastal waters (both the western
and eastern coasts of Sweden) and inland lakes during June and July. An
estimated several thousand birds have been found dead. Clinical signs in
sick birds have included ataxia, dropped wings, convulsions, and diarrhea.
Birds die acutely or after some time [after becoming diseased. The
postmortem condition of birds [has ranged from [well-nourished to emaciated.
Several birds have been submitted to the National Veterinary Institute in
Uppsala for postmortem examination. No macroscopically clear lesions have
been noted in dead birds. Histologically, minor inflammatory reactions
including necrosis have been observed in liver and kidney.
Bacteriological, virological, and parasitological tests have so far been
negative, as have tests for botulism, Newcastle disease, and influenza
virus. There has been no indication of any toxic compound. Based on the
spread of the disease and other epidemiological data, a viral disease
cannot be excluded, and specimens are presently [being investigated in our
laboratories for virus. Collaboration has also been established with
colleagues in the Netherlands, where mortality in gulls and other sea birds
also has been observed.

[Thanks to Torsten for these informed details. We look forward to more
information as it becomes available. As this is not likely to be a unique
event and should have been noted by other Scandinavian and Baltic
countries, other accounts of it, or similar conditions, are sought. Note
that a possible similar condition is under study in The Netherlands. -
