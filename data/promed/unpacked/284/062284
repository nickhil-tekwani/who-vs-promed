Monsoon fevers are de rigueur in Odisha. While swine flu and dengue are spreading in the urban areas, the tribal hinterland has been beset with outbreaks of encephalitis since 2012. Though no Japanese encephalitis (JE) mortalities have been registered as yet in the official records, 473 acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases have been diagnosed so far. Odisha stands 5th in AES mortality after Uttar Pradesh, Assam, West Bengal and Bihar.

According to the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, AES had taken 13 lives by the 1st week of August [2017].

Both AES and JE have been regular in Odisha since 2012. Last year, the state grabbed the national headlines when 115 children died of AES and 42 fell to JE. Most of the deaths were reported from Malkangiri district.

But the state government has been equivocating on the incidence of AES. It went to the extent of claiming that consumption of seeds of a plant called _Cassia occidentalis_, locally known as Bada Chakunda, caused death of a 3rd of the children who fell to encephalitis in Malkangiri district.

An expert committee suggested that JE could not be blamed for all the deaths because "encephalopathy" was the culprit. Encephalopathy, it said, is a non-infectious biochemical syndrome that can be aggravated by the consumption of _Cassia_ seeds. The fact is the Naveen Patnaik government remained aloof to the spread of AES, which is caused by a vector-borne virus hosted by pigs.

The Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC), Bhubaneswar, carried out a study on the outbreak of AES in Malkangiri in 2015 but its findings were not paid heed to. From 38 deaths in 2012 to 115 in 2016, the AES surge was waiting to happen.

[As of the end of May [2017], there were 313 cases of AES with 10 deaths in Odisha and now the case count is 473 with 13 deaths in the 1st week of August [2017]. Odisha state is endemic for Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus, and cases occur there frequently. As with cases of encephalitis mentioned above and in other states in northeastern India, not all encephalitis cases are due to JE virus and are classified as acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) with undetermined etiology.

As noted in previous ProMED-mail comments, AES is a term used for multiple etiologies or often when no etiology has been determined. The encephalitis picture in northeastern India is complicated. Although JE virus etiology of some previously reported encephalitis cases has been confirmed by laboratory tests, many cases go undiagnosed, or JE virus infection is ruled out, and other etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_O. tsutsugamushi_) and lychee fruit consumption, have been proposed.

However, in November 2016 the Odisha state government formed the 6-member panel, led by eminent virologist Dr Jacob John from Vellore's Christian Medical College. In the interim report, Dr John said that anthraquinone, a toxin found in the plant [_Cassia occidentalis_], was found in the urine sample of 5 deceased children. "This indicates that the children (had) consumed the seeds of the plant," he said. Getting to an accurate diagnosis in these cases of AES will require active field surveillance with epidemiological studies supported by timely laboratory testing.

[_Cassia occidentalis_, also called _Senna occidentalis_, produces seeds, in long seed pods that are sometimes roasted and made into a coffee-like beverage, Its roots, leaves, flowers, and seeds have been used medicinally as, for example, a laxative (attributed to the actions of anthraquinones found in the plant), an antipyretic, a tonic , and a diuretic (http://www.rain-tree.com/fedegosa.htm#.WZoIOsaZPjA). - Mod.ML]
