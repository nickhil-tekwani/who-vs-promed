The Ministry of Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation Development has mobilised 16 000 doses of anthrax vaccines for livestock in Filabusi area in the Umzingwane District of Matabeleland South. This followed an anthrax outbreak in Filabusi, which left 45 cattle dead and 53 people hospitalised after eating meat from infected carcasses.

The Director of Veterinary Services (DVS), Dr Josphat Nyika, yesterday said there have not been any further infections reported on livestock or human beings. "We have mobilised 16 000 doses of vaccines and these are enough for the vaccination of cattle, goats and sheep in the affected area. Anthrax affects all warm-blooded animals including human beings. The Parliamentary Portfolio committee on Lands, Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation will tour the affected area next week to assess the situation," he said.

Dr Nyika said the DVS was continuing with roadblocks and veterinary checks to minimise the spread of the disease. "DVS teams are still on the ground to ensure there is no movement of cattle into the quarantine points. We are also monitoring abattoirs and all slaughtering activities," he said. The anthrax outbreak was reported at Mahanka, Muzola and Mawabeni dip tanks in Filabusi last week.

Dr Nyika said anthrax outbreaks were common during the rain season because of the rains that wash away the top soil and expose spores.

The ministries of Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation Development and Health and Child Care formed a joint campaign to alert the public to refrain from eating uninspected meat or meat from animals that die from natural causes. Anthrax carcasses should not be opened.

Signs of anthrax include sudden death of livestock, rapid decomposition of the bloated carcasses, and tarry blood coming out of all natural openings. Dr Nyika urged farmers to report to the police or nearest veterinary offices any incidents of sudden death of cattle. Anthrax is an acute disease caused by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_. Most forms of the disease are lethal, and it affects mostly animals. It can be transmitted through contact with infected meat. Dormant anthrax spores can survive in the soil for more than 45 years.

[I am glad to see that the MAMID has "mobilised" 16 000 doses of Sterne vaccine, by implication for the free vaccination of the at-risk livestock. The benefits should be clear.

The part played by rain in the ecology of _B. anthracis_ is easier to speculate on than scientifically prove. Yes, outbreaks are associated with rain, and rain will precede outbreaks. Rain will soften soil so that cattle grazing a previously contaminated site will take in contaminated soil along with the roots of any forage they graze; cattle are thought to consume some 5-6 lbs of soil per day while grazing. Cattle graze by tugging the forage out of the soil with their tongues; sheep and horses snip the grass leaves, though sheep prefer to eat weeds.

Rain stimulates grazing growth after a dry season, so the tasty fresh grass will attract cattle and other livestock and wildlife. And the proposed germination cycle said to occur in relation to plant roots will provide an increase in the numbers of organisms, preferably spores, consumed. Significant lateral movement of contaminated soil has been proposed, and outbreaks have been noted downstream of cattle burial sites, especially in relation to "water meadows." And it is probable that rain filling the soil column above a contaminated carcass will facilitate the upward movement of spores to the soil surface and grazing root environment. - Mod.MHJ
