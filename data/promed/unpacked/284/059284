As of 15 Nov 2013, a total of 389 individuals infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Heidelberg have been reported from 23 states and Puerto Rico. Most of the ill people (74 per cent) have been reported from California. Since the last update on 30 Oct 2013, 28 new cases have been reported from 8 states: Arizona (2), California (20), Idaho (1), Illinois (1), Louisiana (1), Nevada (1), Oregon (1), and Virginia (1). One ill person from Texas has been removed from the CDC case count because the person does not meet the outbreak case definition.

Among 380 people for whom information is available, illness onset dates range from 1 Mar 2013 to 29 Oct 2013. Ill people range in age from less than 1 year to 93 years, [median 19 years]. 52 per cent of cases are male. Among 312 people with available information, 125 (40 per cent) reported being hospitalized. 14 per cent of ill people have developed blood infections as a result of their illness. Typically, about 5 per cent of those diagnosed with salmonellosis develop blood infections. No deaths have been reported.

Illnesses that occurred after 14 Oct 2013 might not be reported yet due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks.

Investigation update
--------------------
Among the 252 ill people reported in California, state and local health officials identified at least 25 ill people as part of a cluster of illness. The ill people consumed food purchased from the same Costco store location in South San Francisco in the week before they became sick. Based on interviews with ill people, an association was identified between illness and consumption of cooked rotisserie chicken purchased from this store location. Shopper card information was successfully used to determine the specific food linked to illnesses and allowed investigators to identify the chicken involved as belonging to the Foster Farms brand. Ill people gave permission for public health officials to retrieve purchase information based on shopper card numbers. This investigation is ongoing.

Two samples of leftover rotisserie chicken were collected by public health officials from the home of ill people in California infected with outbreak strains of _S._ Heidelberg. Laboratory testing conducted by the California Food and Drug Laboratory Branch identified 1 of the outbreak strains of _S._ Heidelberg in both samples of leftover rotisserie chicken.

On 12 Oct 2013, Costco's El Camino Real store located in South San Francisco, California recalled more than 9000 units (about 40 000 pounds) of rotisserie chicken products. The products subject to recall included 8730 "Kirkland Signature Foster Farms" rotisserie chickens and 313 total units of "Kirkland Farm" rotisserie chicken soup, rotisserie chicken leg quarters, and rotisserie chicken salad. The products were sold directly to consumers in the Costco store between 11 Sep 2013 and 23 Sep 2013. While the use-by date has passed and these products are no longer available for retail sale, USDA-FSIS [USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service] is concerned that some product may be frozen in consumers' freezers.

On 17 Oct 2013, Costco's El Camino Real store recalled an additional 14 093 units of rotisserie chicken products that may be contaminated with _S._ Heidelberg. This is in addition to the 9043 units that were recalled on 12 Oct 2013. The products subject to recall include 13 455 "Kirkland Signature Foster Farms" rotisserie chickens and 638 total units of "Kirkland Farm" rotisserie chicken soup, rotisserie chicken leg quarters, and rotisserie chicken salad. The products were sold directly to consumers in the Costco store between 24 Sep 2013 and 15 Oct 2013. Costco and the California Department of Public Health discovered through a follow-up investigation to the previous recall that additional product should be recalled. No illnesses have been reported in association with the product recalled on 17 Oct 2013. According to USDA-FSIS, the problem with possibly contaminated rotisserie chicken products at this Costco location may be the result of cross-contamination after the cooking process in the preparation area.

Seven strains of _S._ Heidelberg bacteria have been identified as being linked to this outbreak. Ill people infected with each of the 7 strains were linked to consumption Foster Farms chicken. 4 of these strains are rarely reported to PulseNet. The other 3 strains are more common, with several ill persons infected with each strain reported to CDC monthly. Since illnesses due to several strains are more commonly reported, not all may be linked to consumption of Foster Farms chicken and may be part of the expected number of illnesses reported during this period.

CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill persons and to interview them about foods eaten before becoming ill. USDA-FSIS is continuing to work closely with CDC and state partners during this investigation.

[It is certainly likely that the contamination of the seemingly adequately cooked chicken occurred after cooking but the mode of cross-contamination may not be known. In commercial and home kitchens, adequate controls need to be in place to prevent such cross-contamination. - Mod.LL
