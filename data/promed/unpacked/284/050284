A 3 week old cholera epidemic that has killed more than 640 people in Haiti
is spreading quickly in the north west coastal city of Gonaives [the
capital of the Artibonite Department], authorities said on Wed 10 Nov 2010.

Pierrelus Saint-Justin, the mayor of Gonaives, said he personally buried 31
people on Tue 9 Nov 2010, and had another 15 bodies in a truck waiting for
burial. "Others should be dying as we speak," Saint-Justin told Reuters in
a telephone interview. "Since 5 Nov 2010, we have buried at least 70 people
and that is only in the downtown area of Gonaives. There are more people
who died in rural areas surrounding Gonaives."

The city is no stranger to tragedy, since much of it was encased in mud by
hurricanes and tropical storms that killed several thousand people in 2004
and 2008. But Saint-Justin said the situation was once again "getting
catastrophic" in Gonaives, possibly worsened by flooding from hurricane
Tomas earlier this month [5 Nov 2010]. "We are calling on all those who can
come to help," he said. "The hospitals are full. We are overwhelmed."

It was not clear how many of the Gonaives deaths were included in the most
recent figures issued by Haiti's health ministry, which said cholera had
killed 648 people in the Caribbean country and sickened 9971 up to 8 Nov 2010.

Radio reports from across the poorest nation in the Americas indicate the
death toll could easily exceed 700 people when updated figures are released
on Fri 12 Nov 2010.

Cholera has mostly hit Haiti's rural central regions so far, but
authorities say it has now gained a foothold in Port-au-Prince and is
menacing crowded slum areas of the capital. Among the most vulnerable areas
are tent and tarpaulin camps in Port-au-Prince still housing more than 1.3
million survivors of Haiti's devastating 12 Jan 2010 earthquake.
