Plague - Congo DR
------------------
From 27 Mar 2022 to 31 Aug 2022, i.e., 158 days of epidemic, the health zone of Rethy, located in Djugu territory, Ituri province, DR Congo, continues to report cases of plague. A total of 596 suspected cases of plague have been reported, representing an attack rate of 0.23% with 8 deaths (case fatality rate 1.3%). So far, the most affected health area is Lokpa with 78.4% of cases; followed by Uketha, 11.9%; and Rassia, 6.7%.

The bubonic form remains dominant with 581 cases, i.e., 97.5%, and 4 pulmonary cases, 3 of which were notified in July 2022. The high location of the buboes (axilla, cervical, sub-maxilla) in 59.3% of the patients points to contamination during sleep. The average age of the patients is 17 years. The most affected sex is female, 54.5%, against male, 45.5%. The average number of notifications per week is 24 cases, with a peak in week 24, with 53 cases notified.

In these days, the rains are abundant in the region, which slows down the efforts of those who were sanitizing their homes, and the population is seeing a pullulation of rodents and fleas in their homes. With the heavy rains, people are forced to stay in their homes, which increases the risk of catching the plague.

[ProMED thanks Drs Adroba and Laudisoit for their continued contributions regarding _Yersinia pestis_ infections in Congo DR.

Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a bubo. Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, other animals, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. Bacteremia can also occur as an initial event. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. The pneumonic form of infection can spread by the airborne route. - Mod.LL
