As many as 126 cattle have died and 25 districts affected by the lumpy skin disease [LSD] virus in Maharashtra, informed the state's animal husbandry department on Saturday [17 Sep 2022].

"A total of 126 infected animals have died including 47 in Jalgaon district, 21 in Ahmednagar district, 2 in Dhule, 18 in Akola, 14 in Pune, 2 in Latur, 6 in Satara, 5 in Buldhana, 7 in Amravati, 1 in Sangli, 1 in Washim, 1 in Jalna, and 1 in Nagpur District," the release stated.

"Lumpy skin disease (LSD) has been rapidly spreading all throughout the Maharashtra state. It is a cutaneous viral disease of the bovines. This disease is not transmitted to human beings either from animals or through cow milk," the animal husbandry department release stated.

In the release, IAS officer Sachindra Pratap Singh appealed on behalf of the government: "Although the disease has been spreading, the spread is limited to cows and bullocks and is not zoonotic. Strict action will be undertaken in case of spreading rumours on social media."

He further informed about the allocations and arrangements that are being made to combat the situation.

According to the animal husbandry department, a fund of INR 1 crore [INR 10 million / USD 125 459] per district has been made available through DPC for the purchase of medicines needed in the treatment of the disease. An honorarium of INR 3 [about USD 0.04] per vaccination has also been admissible to the vaccinators and interns of the Maharashtra Animal and Fisheries Sciences University (MAFSU).

"The government veterinary officers and private practitioners should carry out treatment as the MAFSU Treatment protocol. It is also requested to all farmers to avail free treatment for their affected cattle at their doorstep by reporting to nearby government veterinary dispensaries / livestock development officers about any symptoms of LSD," the release further said.

Commissioner of the Animal Husbandry said, "According to Section 4(1) of Prevention and Control of Infectious and Communicable Diseases in Animals Act, 2009, every person, non-governmental organization, concerned local self-government body is obliged to report the said information to the nearest veterinary institution if symptoms of this disease are found in animals."

[India informed the WOAH about its 1st lumpy skin disease [LSD] event on 18 Nov 2019; it had reportedly started 12 Aug 2019. The report addressed 3 outbreaks, all in India's northeastern state Odisha. The outbreak, assumed to be introduced from Bangladesh, spread during the following months to the states of Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Assam, and (probably) Kerala. As published by the media, Maharashtra's state Animal Husbandry department informed that LSD was first detected there, namely in the Gadchiroli district, in April 2020, spreading further. When the disease reached Chandrapur, becoming the worst-affected district, a massive vaccination programme was launched in Chandrapur, Gadchiroli, and Nagpur. As of 3 Sep 2020, 93 252 infections were reported and 152 000 animals vaccinated with a local goat pox vaccine (GTPV Uttarkashi strain). The department said that 450 000 vaccine doses were available. "Whenever an infection is detected, we send the vaccine to inoculate the healthy animals to contain the spread," they said (see ProMED post 20200905.7750293). Later information about LSD in India became scarce until 2022, the epizootic probably blurred by the COVID-19 event's impact on all aspects of life, including veterinary activities.

The current circulation and disease cases of LSD in Maharashtra need to be studied, in particular addressing vaccinated animals. Hopefully, the vaccinated animals are identifiable, allowing the assessment. In case the vaccination policy has been continuing since 2020 (and this is yet to be clarified), an efficacious, live attenuated vaccine should have conferred immunity for an extended period.

[2] Genotyping, vaccine efficacy

The lumpy skin disease (LSD) virus that has killed at least 50 000 cattle in India this year [2022] maybe structurally different from the version of the virus prevalent in India in 2019, raising questions on whether the new vaccine being developed for safeguarding cattle may be adequately protective.

Scientists at the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB) and the State Disease Diagnostic Centre, Jaipur, analysed 5 animals with symptoms of the disease and compared genomes of the virus extracted from them. Six genomes (there were multiple genomes from a single animal) showed that it had "little similarity to global genomes" when compared with genetic sequences from earlier outbreaks of the disease.

The analysis of the genomes revealed 177 unique variants, none of which were found in 4 genome sequences from India belonging to the 2019 outbreak of the disease deposited in GenBank, a popular database.

"Analysis of the viral sequences suggests the genomes from the 2022 outbreak harbour a large number of genetic variations compared to the reference genome and form a distinct lineage," the authors say in their paper [citation 1 in the commentary]. The study appears on the preprint server bioRxiv and is yet to be peer reviewed.

This is significant, as Lumpi-ProVacInd, a vaccine developed by the Indian Veterinary Research Institute and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research's (ICAR) National Research Centre on Equines, is based on LSD virus samples from cattle in Ranchi afflicted in the 2019 outbreak. However, experimental trials conducted on animals afflicted in the ongoing 2022 outbreak with the vaccine have revealed encouraging results, ICAR and the Ministry of Agriculture have stated.

The vaccine is a live attenuated, or a weakened version of the virus that, when injected into animals, is expected to stimulate the immune system and protect against a probable infection. Currently, the only vaccines available for the disease are vaccines for goat pox and sheep pox, which are related to the LSD virus.

"That's the million-dollar question on what the implications of this genome sequencing mean for the vaccine," Sridhar Sivasubbu of the CSIR-IGIB and one of the scientists associated with the genome sequencing study said.

This specific study, he said, threw no light as there were too few animals tested and only a broader sample of viral genomes spanning several states could answer if the variants identified and analysed in Rajasthan as part of the study were widespread in India.

Another point of concern that the IGIB study raises is that one of the animals appeared to have 2 different variants of the LSD virus when virus was extracted from its nose as well as from the skin, suggesting that the virus appeared to be able to evolve within a single host. This again speaks to the increased infectivity of the LSD virus in 2022 compared to 2019.

The Centre recently said about 57 000 cattle have died so far due to the disease, which has spread to Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Andhra Pradesh.

The disease has raised concerns over its impact on the dairy business. India is the world's largest milk producer at about 210 million tonnes annually.

[According to FAO's 2020 publication "LSD qualitative risk assessment & management" (see citation 2 below), the economic impact of LSD on South, East, and Southeast Asia's countries was estimated to be up to USD 1.45 billion in direct losses of livestock and production. The document discussed the trade implications for the infected countries. For India, a prominent exporter, globally, of live cattle, buffalo, and their meat/meat products, the losses could become of very high magnitude.

Reportedly, India initially excluded the use of foreign commercial, live-attenuated LSD-homologous vaccine (LSDV Neethling strain), which is available internationally (6 known producers). This vaccine strain has been found effective during recent years in controlling the spread of LSD in the Middle East, southeastern Europe, and elsewhere. The Indian authorities launched the wide application of the local goat pox vaccine (GTPV Uttarkashi strain). According to the FAO risk assessment, in the meantime the GTPV vaccine has been found as effective against LSD in Bangladesh. (See "vaccination" on pages 29-31, citation 2.)

Detailed results of vaccination of (beef and dairy) breeds of cattle with India's new indigenous homologous live vaccine, its efficacy and safety, are anticipated with great interest. - Mod.AS
