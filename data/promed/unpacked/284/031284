Could you please tell me what virus this would be? We've heard some talk of
PRRS virus having a zoonotic potential, but have rubbished the claims. Are
we in error?

I found the following citation on the subject...
Patience,C., Takeuchi,Y.& Weiss,R.A. Infection of human cells by an
endogenous retrovirus of pigs. Nature Medicine Vol.3 pp282-286 (March 1997)
There is a discussion of the issue in the News and Views of the same
Journal. Also in the same issue, and possibly having the author's think at
the moment, is the following paper Deacon et al,'Histological evidence of
fetal pig neural cell survival after transplantation into a patient with
Parkinson's disease'. Pages 350-353.
One wonders what effect the findings of the first paper will have on the
following up of the second.

Why should I be any more concerned about xenotransplation then
xenocohabitation? Should I ban my pet dogs and cats from the house? Humans
have been living in intimate contact with domestic animals for so long that
it is difficult to take the risk of infection from xenotransplantation of
pig organs as anything but a purely theoretical
excercise.

Subject: Xenotransplantation; Clarification

This is just a clarification regarding FDA's procedures and policies and
Xenotransplantation. There were some minor yet important errors in the
previous e-mail.
FDA has not "Approved" the "Practice" of Xenotransplantation. There is no
Federal Law (or State, I believe) banning the procedure. In any case, FDA
approves products not procedures. Each Xeno-graft application will be
reviewed on an individual basis.
FDA also has not at present issued any REGULATIONS (i.e. requirements)
specifically regarding Xenotransplantation.
On September 23, 1996, FDA along with other PHS agencies issued DRAFT
Guidelines on the Infectious Disease Issues in Xenotransplantation. These
guidelines were issued for comment. These are not legal requirements but are
guidelines intended to help ensure the safety of the American public.
I think there is a misconception that FDA or the PHS is endorsing or
performing Xenotransplantation procedures. This is not true. However, FDA
does have a legal responsibility to evaluate all possible therapuetic
product applications that are sent to the Agency. It is also FDA's
responsibility to protect the public health regarding possible infectious
disease transmission.
Therefore, FDA and the other public health agencies issued the DRAFT
guidelines for comment and for guidance to help ensure that SPONSORS who
choose to pursue Xenotransplantation will contact the FDA regarding their
proposed investigations into possibly therapeutic products (as is required
by Federal Law) and protect their employees and the American public from
possible infectious disease transmission.
