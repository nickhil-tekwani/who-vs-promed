The state's [South Dakota] wildlife division confirmed another 25
cases of chronic wasting disease in deer and elk during the latest
testing period.

The disease attacks the brains of infected animals and is always
fatal. The Game, Fish and Parks Department [GFP] tests for the
disease in samples provided by hunters and in sick animals observed
in the wild.

The state tested 1823 samples from last July [2009] through January
this year [2010]. [See comment below. - Mod.MHJ]

The state has found 136 cases of chronic wasting disease since
testing began in 1997. All infected animals have come from Custer,
Fall River, and Pennington counties in the southwest corner of the state.

[Actually if you go to SD GFP 'Latest chronic wasting disease testing
results" at
<http://gfp.sd.gov/wildlife/diseases/chronic-wasting-disease/cwd-testing-results.aspx>,
you will see that the 1823 samples cover from 1 Jul 2009 through 30
Apr 2010, and involved 402 elk samples (6 positive), 476 mule deer (8
positive), 989 white-tailed deer (13 positive), and 1 moose (0
positive). These positives have yet to be mapped.

However there are 2 excellent historic maps listed on their chronic
wasting disease page at
<http://gfp.sd.gov/wildlife/diseases/chronic-wasting-disease/default.aspx>,
namely:

and
Black Hills view of Positive CWD cases in South Dakota, 2001-May 2009
<http://gfp.sd.gov/wildlife/diseases/images/cwd-positives-blackhills-map.jpg>.

South Dakota GFP is to be commended on its transparency and openness.
