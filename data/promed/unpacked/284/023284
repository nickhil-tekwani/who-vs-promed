[Life-threatening infection due to _Neisseria meningitidis_ usually
manifests as either bloodstream infection (meningococcemia) with or without
meningitis. Meningococcemia can be a very fulminant infection, progressing
from wellness to death within 24 hours, and it can be associated with
diffuse cutaneous and vital organ bleeding. It may also cause peripheral
symmetrical gangrene, which may result in one or more extremity amputations.
Since meningococal disease is endemic, if only sporadic cases were to occur
in other areas of the country, these may not be related unless more
information is known about the isolates. - Mod.LL]
