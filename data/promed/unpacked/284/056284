I read the above article with some interest, as the association of infection
with living on, or having visited farms, was very similar to that which we
described in a descriptive epidemiological study carried out in Scotland a
few years ago (1). The main findings were the relatively high frequency of
those who in the 2-4 weeks prior to the onset of illness had:-
Been involved in gardening/garden play (36%)
Lived on/visited farms (20%)
Direct/indirect contact with animal manure (17%)
Private water supplies (12%)
Recent failures with high coliform counts of their water supplies (12%)
Again this suggests contamination with animal faeces is important, and
indeed the bovine source of infection was demonstrated as a direct risk
factor in rural areas. In addition the role of possible person-to-person
transmission was reaffirmed, and we also found that consumption of burgers
did not appear to be a risk factor. We are currently addressing these
questions further in a case control study supported by the UK Department of
Health.
