[The compilation above shows that HPAI H5N1 continues to spread throughout Egypt and hits commercial farms as well as small familial backyard poultry of various species. - Mod.AB

Out of the total world's HPAI H5N1 human cases (850 confirmed so far, of which there have been 449 deaths, since the emergence of HPAI H5N1 in humans in 2003 -- initially in mainland China), Egypt (reporting since 2006) has suffered a total of 350 confirmed human cases, of which 116 reportedly died. Indonesia ranks 2nd, reporting, since 2005, 199 confirmed human cases (of which 167 reportedly died). The 3rd on the list is Viet Nam, with a total of 127 confirmed human cases reported since 2003, of which 64 died (no new human cases reported there since 2015). - Mod.AS
