[According to preliminary genotyping results, the recent isolates of FMDV serotype O from the Gaza strip and from Israel are identical, both identified as O topotype EA-3. This East African topotype , endemic in Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya and Sudan, has been circulating in Egypt at least since 2012. The most recent genotyped samples were collected there (in the governorate Beni Suef) in late March 2016 (see at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/africa/egy.htm).

Egypt belongs to 2 FMD pools: pool 3 (West Eurasia & Middle East) and pool 4 (Eastern Africa), becoming the unfortunate FMD transmission bridge between East Africa and the Middle East. An earlier foreboding of this unwelcomed scenario was the introduction, in April 2012, of FMDV serotype SAT 2 to the Gaza strip. In contrast to the current event, it did not enter Israel. - Mod AS
