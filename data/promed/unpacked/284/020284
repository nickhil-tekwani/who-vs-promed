**Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with infected animal(s) at grazing/watering; contact with wild species
Epidemiological comments: ingestion of [_B. anthracis_] spores from the soil is closely linked to the drought that has persisted in the area.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; quarantine; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Central Veterinary Laboratory, Tanzania (national laboratory) / Black wildebeest / nested RT-PCR / 18 Nov 2016 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[The numbers appear to be reliable. I would suspect that the wildebeest provided the momentum, not just because they were the majority affected but also they would have been the major target for female tabanids in search of a blood meal, and their size and colour would be a good 'black-body' attractant for these flies with their excellent vision. Goats and sheep are missed by flies but they are curious and would be attracted to any extravasated blood from an affected carcass.

In the previous report of 15 Nov 2016, the district livestock officer, Mr Salum Omar, stated, "We are taking initiatives to vaccinate the remaining species of livestock against the disease, but people should take precautions not to eat meat from dead animals or even touch their carcasses." This report to OIE indicates either a failure in communication between the field and headquarters or that adequate Sterne vaccine doses for the exposed livestock has yet to be located. Mr Omar earlier claimed a decimation of livestock. Extrapolation would indicate that the immediate need would be for just some 500 doses. But logically, all livestock within a radius of 10-15 km (6.2-9.3 mi) should be vaccinated, and especially the cattle. - Mod.MHJ
