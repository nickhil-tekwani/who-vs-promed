>From news media sources
The worst-ever outbreak of Lassa fever, a deadly hemorrhagic disease, is
threatening to spread to Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown. Britain's Medical
Emergency Relief International (MERLIN) said the case numbers had doubled
since December. Refugees fleeing the 6-year old civil war were packing into
the town of Kenema, 60 miles from the capital, and conditions are appropriate
for the spread of the highly virulent disease. "This is the worst outbreak
of Lassa fever since records began," said Richard Allen, medical adviser to
MERLIN. "Now we are concerned that Lassa fever may spread from the bush to
the capital city, Freetown. The first suspected case of Lassa fever was
admitted to a Freetown hospital this week."
Spokesman Jonathan Lorie said there had been 239 cases with 35 deaths so far
this year -- compared to 367 cases and 93 deaths for the whole of last year.
[>700 expected cases and >100 deaths in 1997 if the epidemic is not quenched.-
- Mod CHC]. Cases occur each year. "There was an epidemic last summer but it
died down in the autumn and the epidemic has renewed itself since January.
He also said that his group is buying as much ribaviran as it can.
