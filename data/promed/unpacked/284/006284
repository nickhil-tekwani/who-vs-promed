_Alternaria alternata_ - a new foliar fungal pathogen of tea in North
Bengal, India
-----------------------------------------------
B. N. Chakraborty <bnc_nbu@hotmail.com>, R. Das-Biswas and M. Sharma.
Immuno-Phytopathology Laboratory, Department of Botany, University of
North Bengal, 734430, Darjeeling, India Accepted for publication 16 Oct 2005.
Between July-September 2003, severe foliar infection was observed on
nursery-grown tea plants (_Camellia sinensis_) in 5 tea estates in
the region of Dooars, North Bengal, India. Disease symptoms 1st
appeared as greyish brown patches around tips and margins of young
leaves. These lesions extend towards the midrib resulting in leaf
curl, death and defoliation. In severe infections, over 70 percent of
the tea crop in affected nurseries was unusable. Older leaves appear
to be less susceptible. The plants (T-17) in the nurseries where
disease was found were growing under optimal conditions (i.e. not
stressed): temperature (28 +/-2 C), humidity (60 - 70 percent), and
were not affected by any other pathogens or physiological conditions.
Similar symptoms have also been observed in field-grown plants. Field
symptoms were observed one month following transfer of plants from
the nursery. The disease was also noticed in the tea nursery the
following year.
A fungus was consistently isolated from the margins of these lesions
onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium amended with streptomycin
sulphate. Cultures were maintained at 28 +/-2 C for 15 days.
Microscopic examination revealed brown and septate hyphae and
conidiophores (17-28 x 3-6 micrometers). Muriform conidia (23 -34 x
7-10 micrometers) were usually solitary but occasionally in short
chains. Based on the morphological characters, the fungus was
identified as _Alternaria alternata_ [Aa] (W8053) and this
identification was confirmed by the Global Plant Clinic, CABI
Bioscience UK Centre.
Pathogenicity tests were conducted on 23 tea varieties using
unwounded, detached leaves, cut shoots and whole plants inoculated
(500 000 spores per ml of the original Aa isolate) and tested in the
laboratory, glass house and field respectively (Chakraborty et al.,
1995). Distilled water was used as controls. Among these 23
varieties, 12 were from the Tocklai Experimental Station, Jorhat,
Assam (TV), 8 from UPASI Tea Research Center Valparai, Tamilnadu
(UPASI), while 3 were from Darjeeling Tea Research Center, Kurseong
(T). Inoculated plants were covered with a polythene bag and
incubated at 28 +/-2 C, under a 16 hour photoperiod. Disease symptoms
developed within 3 days on inoculated detached and attached leaves
and shoots. Control plants remained unaffected. The pathogen was
re-isolated from lesions, thereby completing Koch's postulates.
All varieties tested showed variable degrees of susceptibility to the
pathogen apart from TV-28, UPASI-2 and UPASI-8 that were resistant.
Tea varieties T-17, T-78 and TV-22 were found to be highly
susceptible. A polyclonal antibody has been raised against the
virulent isolate of Aa (W8053), and an immunodiagnostic kit has been
developed for early detection of the pathogen from tea leaf tissues.
This is the 1st report of a pathogenic Aa affecting tea in India.

[Aa is the most frequently reported _Alternaria_ species causing
plant disease. It is primarily a weak pathogen, attacking already
stressed plants, but may also be pathogenic on healthy plants.
In India, the present approach has been to find bio-pesticides that
are free of hazardous residues and environmental pollution. In the
light of increasing awareness about adverse effects of pesticide
residues in food on human health, which is often reflected in
adoption of more and more stringent regulations by many countries, a
well equipped pesticide residue laboratory was establish at Tocklai
which will direct research towards integrated approach to pest and
disease management through uses of, biocides, parasites, predators,
cultural methods and safer chemicals. For biological control of
pests, survey for natural enemy complex of pests is in progress.
Experiments on mass breeding of promising species of parasitoids and
predators of the major tea pests are also in progress under
controlled laboratory conditions.
Fungal pathogens such as _Trichoderma_ spp. are being effectively
used for the control of _Poria hypobrunnea_, which causes stem canker
in North-East India. Application of bioformulations of _T. harzianum_
and _Gliocladium virens_ to the soil and for wound dressing at the
time of pruning suppresses the development of canker. The bacterium
_Bacillus subtilis_ is effective in the control of black rot disease
caused by _Corticium invisum_ and _C. theae_. Blister blight disease
caused by _Exobasidium vexans_ is an important leaf disease leading
to heavy crop loss in South India and Darjeeling. Manipulation of the
micro climate by shade regulation contributes greatly reduces disease
incidence. However, it will be necessary to spray copper oxychloride
to control this disease under the agroclimatic conditions of South
India. In the new planting areas, it is necessary to avoid the
planting of cultivars which are highly prone to the incidence of
major pests and disease.
