The Department of Health [DOH] on Monday [27 Oct 2008] banned the sale and
export of Sunflower Crackers Blueberry Creme Sandwich after the
Philippine-made product tested positive for melamine contamination.

In a statement, Health Secretary Francisco Duque said he has ordered
the pullout of the melamine-tainted product from store shelves pending
test results from the Bureau of Food and Drugs. He said he also asked
BFAD [Bureau of Food and Drugs] to test all Sunflower products
manufactured by Croley Foods Manufacturing Corporation for possible
traces of the deadly additive.

Sunflower Crackers Blueberry Creme Sandwich is the 1st locally
manufactured food product to test positive for melamine.

The Hong Kong Center for Food Safety [CFS] earlier said it found 3.2 parts
per million of melamine in Sunflower Crackers Blueberry Cream
Sandwich, which is above the 2.5 ppm legal limit for melamine in food
products.

Aside from the biscuit [cracker], the CFS said it also detected melamine in
Select Fresh Brown Eggs (Extra Large, 6 piece) from China. They had a
melamine level of 4.7 ppm. [see item 2].

Jeremiah Lim, Croley Foods Manufacturing Corporation spokesman, said
the company will obey the DOH ban. He said the company will conduct
its own investigation on the melamine contamination after it received
certification from its milk supplier, Anbros Industries, that their
products were melamine-free.

BFAD has found melamine in 6 products:
Greenwood Yili Fresh Milk
Jolly Cow Slender High Calcium Low Fat Milk (more Calcium and Vitamin D)
1 Liter;
Lotte B&W Koala Biscuit;
Lotte Chocolate Snack Koala Biscuit;
Lotte Strawberry Snack Koala Biscuit;
Mengniu Drink.

[2] China, eggs

Hong Kong food inspectors have found eggs imported from northeast
China to be contaminated with high levels of melamine, the toxic
industrial additive at the heart of an adulteration scandal over
Chinese milk products.

The findings have raised new concerns here that a far wider array of
China-produced foods than previously believed could be contaminated
by melamine, which already has sickened more than 50 000 children in
China and led to at least 4 deaths.

Scientists in China worry that in addition to adulterated dairy
supplies, melamine may have been intentionally added to animal feed
in China, tainting chicken and possibly fish and hog feed, which
could result in poisonous meat and seafood supplies, according to a
report published Sunday [26 Oct 2008] in the South China Morning Post.

China is struggling with a milk scandal that has devastated its
fast-growing dairy industry and led to a global recall of foods made
with Chinese dairy products, including pizza, biscuits, yogurt and
other goods. Melamine can cause kidney stones and other ailments.

The Chinese government 1st reported melamine-tainted dairy products in
mid-September 2008. It accused rogue dairy producers and middlemen of
intentionally spiking dairy supplies with melamine to save money,
adding the chemical, which is used to produce plastics and fertilizer,
as a cheap filler that can artificially inflate protein readings.

Nearly one quarter of Beijing families have fed their children milk
contaminated with the industrial chemical melamine, state press
reported Sunday [26 Oct 2008].

In an indication of the scale of the tainted milk scandal that has
rocked the country, more than 74 000 of nearly 308 000 households
questioned in the capital said their children were fed the products
before they were taken off the shelves, the Beijing News reported.

So far, at least 4 infants have died; the paper did not say how many
-- if any -- of the fatalities occurred in Beijing.

The scandal broke in early September 2008 and has badly tarnished the
image of Chinese dairy products, with [60] countries around the world
banning or curtailing imports [60 countries according to one count. -

Although at least one Chinese dairy firm knew of the problem for
months, it did not immediately report it to local government
officials. They in turn delayed passing on the news for nearly a
month until after the August 2008 Beijing Olympics.

According to the Beijing News, hospitals in the capital have reported
that 3458 infants have been hospitalised with kidney stones, the main
symptom of ingesting the melamine. More than 211 000 children have
had urinary tract examinations at Beijing hospitals and medical
clinics since the scandal broke, it added.

China's parliament is currently considering a draft food safety law
that aims to prevent any cover-ups by health authorities, while making
them directly responsible for approving additives in processed foods,
Xinhua news agency reported.

[4] China, control measures

China has burnt 32 200 tons of melamine-tainted dairy products in a
bid to put behind it a health scandal in which tens of thousands of
infants fell ill.

State television showed boxes and packets of milk powder and baby
formula being shoveled into giant furnaces in Shijiazhuang in the
northern province of Hebei, where the scandal broke in September 2008.
The goods were being burnt in 4 cement factories and 2 iron and
steel factories.

China began reviewing a tougher draft food safety law on Thursday [23
Oct 2008] following criticism from the United Nations over its
sluggish response to the health scandal.

China approved in principle a new food safety law last October [2007]
following a raft of scandals involving unsafe toothpaste, seafood and
pet food, among other products.

The country has since seen 4 children die and thousands of others
made ill from drinking milk formula adulterated with melamine, which
was subsequently found in other drinks and foods, prompting
Chinese-made products to be stripped from shelves worldwide.

More than 3000 children remain in hospital in China.

[5] China: cyromazine in food chain
Date: 27 Oct 2008

<http://www.thepoultrysite.com/poultrynews/16258/melamine-found-in-chinese-eggs>


Premier Wen Jiabao, at the closing of an Asia-Europe summit on
Saturday [25 Oct 2008], vowed China would do all it could to bring the
quality of Chinese food products up to international standard.

But it has emerged that cyromazine, a derivative of melamine, is
widely used in pesticides and animal feed in China, and experts say it
is absorbed in plants as melamine and that the chemical is already in
the human food chain.

However, no one knows how much melamine is absorbed into raw foods
such as meat and vegetables, and experts are hoping Hong Kong's tests
on vegetables and meat will shed some light.

"Since some animal feed used on the mainland might have been polluted
by melamine, our tests will target more on meat imported from the
mainland," Chow was quoted as saying. "As we have found melamine in
eggs, we shall also test chicken meat and we shall also look at offal,
for example chicken kidneys and pig kidneys."

Hong Kong said last week it would test meat, vegetables and processed
food for melamine, a move that underlines concerns about food safety
in the former British colony which returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
