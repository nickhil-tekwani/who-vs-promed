The Qatar Supreme Council of Health recorded a new case of laboratory confirmed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV] in a 61-year-old Qatari citizen.

The Council said in a statement on Thursday [17 Oct 2013], quoted by the Qatari News Agency, that MERS-CoV infection was detected and diagnosed by the National Influenza Center in a 61 year old man with clinical disease and that the patient is receiving treatment and his condition is stable.

Results of an epidemiologic investigation revealed that the patient did not travel outside of the country during the 2 weeks prior to the onset of illness and had not had contact with other known cases with MERS-CoV infection.

The statement said all close contacts of the patient and other family members were being investigated and that the initial results were negative.

A 61-year-old man in Qatar is being treated for a Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, according to a Qatar News Agency report today [17 Oct 2013]. The report marks the country's 6th case.

Qatar's Supreme Council of Health said the man, who has chronic illnesses, is being treated and is in stable condition, according to the story.

Investigators have learned that the man has not traveled outside Qatar recently and has not had contact with other MERS-CoV case-patients, the story said. His family members and other contacts have been tested for the virus, all with negative results.

The story did not mention the patient's home town or whether he had any recent contact with animals.

The last previous MERS-CoV case reported in Qatar involved a 56-year-old woman who died of her infection on [31 Aug 2013]. 2 other cases also were reported in August [2013], and 2 were reported in the fall of 2012. One of the latter cases involved a man who got sick in Qatar in September 2012 and was treated in London but died there in June of this year [2013].

The World Health Organization, [which has reported the new case in its latest update on 18 Oct 2013, lists a total of 139 MERS-CoV cases and 60 deaths]. Other groups have reported slightly higher numbers. FluTrackers, an online infectious disease message board, maintains a case list that currently shows 144 cases, including the new Qatari one.

[This case represents the 6th case of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infection in an individual with probable exposure to the virus in Qatar. This represents the 139th case of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infection including 60 deaths.

The discrepancy in global case counts between the figures presented by WHO and those available on the FluTrackers case list (available at http://www.flutrackers.com/forum/showthread.php?t=205075) awaits clarification (there are now 144 cases including this current case from Qatar).

For a map of the region, see http://healthmap.org/r/25dH. - Mod.MPP

The Flutrackers list has the following footnotes:
"Please note: On September 20th WHO reclassified 2 previously counted confirmed cases (from Italy), taking them out of the coronavirus count. Therefore, the WHO confirmed case count is 2 less than the numeric count shown on our list.

"Please note: We do not have all 62 deaths indicated on this list because the identification of all of the cases has not been released. WHO tweeted that 2 cases of the 62 have not been confirmed yet by Saudi Arabia (cases #133 & #135) so their death count is 60." - Mod.JW]
