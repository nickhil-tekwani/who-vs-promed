Subject: Sued for voicing suspicion of BSE

On April 18, 1997, the second lawsuit of the "Nordfleischzentrale" (NFZ),
(second biggest slaughtering group in Europe) against the meat inspection
vet Mrs. Dr. Margrit Herbst will take place at the Oberlandesgericht in
Schleswig (a higher regional court).
In the first lawsuit, NFZ against Herbst, Mrs. Herbst was sued for trade
libel. Being the responsible meat inspection vet at the abattoir of Bad
Bramstedt (owned by the NFZ) in those days, she had observed several
possible BSE cases, and as these cases were not analysed properly, had
brought the matter before the public. She won the case on Jan 19, 1996.
The district court of Kiel confirmed that 3 suspicious animals (No. 1, 7,
and 8 of the MELFF report 13/2660 to the Schleswig-Holstein state
parliament) had not been examined duly, but had got into consumption
nevertheless.
As the NFZ has filed an appeal against this sentence, the matter is now
brought before the Oberlandesgericht.
Probably this is the only trial in Europe against a meat inspection vet for
having voiced suspicion of BSE. It could turn out that the first promising
efforts of the EU towards an increased protection of the consumer will be
prevented by a German verdict.
(By the way: Independent of the lawsuits and preceding these, Mrs. Herbst
was fired on the spot by her employer. Nota bene: this was not the NFZ, but
the district of Segeberg, a public authority!)

their ability to report BSE cases and institutional responsibility. MHJ]
