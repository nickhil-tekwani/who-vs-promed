[For clarity, BSE = Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, CJD =
Cruetzfeldt-Jacob Disease, nvCJD = new variant Cruetzfeldt-Jacob Disease,
PrPsc = infectious prion. - Mod.TG
The Lancet has the full text of *Investigation of Variant
Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease and Other Human Prion Diseases with Tonsil Biopsy
Samples* available to registered non-subscribers. It is too long and
complex to relay directly. It can be found at
<http://www.thelancet.com/newlancet/reg/issues/vol353no9148/article183.html>.
The article may be summarized essentially as: Infectivity was present
throughout the body tissues in nvCJD patients. Infectivity was absent in
the body tissues in all other forms of CJD and neurological disorders in
patients. Infectivity throughout the body has serious consequences for
iatrogenic cases.
This suggests: new variant CJD is uniquely different from all other forms
of CJD, strengthening the supposition is has a different cause (viz., BSE).
The presence of infectivity in non-nervous tissue for nvCJD suggests a
similar effect for BSE and amplifies the likelihood of foodborne passage.
The presence in non-nervous tissue can be used as a differential diagnosis
of nvCJD vs. other CJD.
Animals studies have shown that spongiform encephalopathy diseases, which
include different forms of CJD, BSE in cattle and scrapie in sheep, tend to
reside in the lymph system before attacking the brain. Tonsils are part of
the lymph system. These findings suggest that human tonsil biopsy samples
may allow presymptomatic diagnosis of nvCJD. Assuming sufficiently
sensitive tests were available, then PrPSc will be detectable in human
tonsil within months of exposure to BSE.
Professor John Collinge, of St Mary's Hospital, London, published in The
Lancet the results of a test on 20 patients suspected to have human BSE,
known as new variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease. The test failed to detect
the prion protein in 11 patients, whom do not have the disease. The protein
was in the tonsils of the remaining 9. Of these, 3 have died and been
confirmed by autopsy; 1 has died but no autopsy was performed and 5 are
still alive. The Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust funded
the research that shows the tonsil test could detect the infectious prion
protein in nvCJD cases, but not the "classical" CJD. Professor Collinge
said this shows how the rogue prion protein behaves quite differently to
CJD. Possibly the oral route of exposure, presumed to be the route of BSE
infection of patients with nvCJD, results in a more pronounced
lymphoreticular phase. Therefore, lymphoreticular tissues from patients
with kuru would be interesting to study.
Prof Collinge, said that scientists plan to screen thousands of people
using the new tonsil test. A significant positive result would provide
early warning of a major epidemic to come and allow time for action aimed
at averting the disaster. An anonymous mass screening program, planned for
later this year, will rely on anonymous tissue donors, tissue removed
during routine tonsillectomies and appendectomies. There are now 35
confirmed cases of nvCJD, which may have developed as a result of people
consuming BSE contaminated beef, but there are fears that this might be
the first signs of an epidemic . Attempts to estimate the future course of
the disease have been hampered by a lack of knowledge and a suitable test
for early diagnosis.
Prof Collinge admitted his concern about the possibility of nvCJD being
transmitted via infected surgical instruments. This had always been a
theoretical risk, but the conclusive evidence of tonsil infection meant it
was now a real possibility. Cost prevents discarding expensive surgical
instruments, said Professor Collinge. He added: "There is no means of
sterilising surgical instruments adequately for prions. My own view of this
is that we may need to consider using more disposable instruments for
certain procedures." Professor Liam Donaldson, the Chief Medical Officer
said, "Current policy based on advice from the Advisory Committee on
Dangerous Pathogens published in April 1998 is when any patient with
symptoms of nvCJD, or suspected of having nvCJD, undergoes surgical
operation, the instruments must be removed so that they cannot be used
again." Experts from the Joint Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens
and the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee are considering the
surgical implications. They will be advising the Government on setting up
new guidelines on the use of disposable surgical instruments to limit the
risks to patients.

Acting on expert advice the Government has already introduced
leucodepletion - removal of white blood cells - for donated blood and
banned the use of British-produced plasma in blood products. There is no
cure for nvCJD at this time, but research has shown that a drug used in
America to treat cystitis may block its spread.
Following this new development with BSE in humans, Nick Brown, Minister of
Agriculture, announced his decision to make the beef industry pay £21.5
million a year in meat hygiene charges for BSE controls. The result was a
clash with leaders of the farming groups. They said the move made a mockery
of the Government's £120 million aid to farmers two months ago. The
Ministry of Agriculture said it did not know how much the charges would be
in individual cases but they would be based "on the current national hourly
rate for employment of meat technicians, meat inspectors and official
veterinary surgeons".
Charges, to be imposed from March 29, will cover the cost of the Meat and
Hygiene Service's enforcement of controls in abattoirs and meat plants to
ensure that "high risk" cattle and sheep offals are kept out of the human
food chain. [If an animal does not show clinical signs, is not from an
infected herd, what makes them *high risk*? - Mod. TG Until now, costs of
checks on specified risk materials, including brain, spinal cord, tonsils
and spleen, have been met by the taxpayer. Ben Gill, president of the
National Farmers' Union of England and Wales, said: "Specified risk
material removal is a public health issue and the industry should not be
expected to bear the costs associated with it."
The Government has allowed the industry until Feb 12 to comment on the
charges - but the consultation process only covers the details. The
decision to pass on the charges has already been taken. [Then what's the
point in comments? - Mod. TG

[Although this is a tremendous advancement in testing and hopefully someday
treatment of nvCJD, it is unfortunate the government considers it necessary
to make the farmers responsible. Yoking the farmer with the responsibility
of this and imposing higher cost on an already suffering industry could
have grave consequences on the food supply. - Mod.TG
