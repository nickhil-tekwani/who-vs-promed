Mangoes are under threat in Sindh by the fast-spreading mango death syndrome. "It causes the leaves and flowers to suddenly turn brown, wither, wilt and drop to the ground," explains a [mango grower]. It is for the 1st time that his orchard [of] 60 acres has been infected to such a vast extent. "Experts call it the sudden death disease. There is no other option but to cut the infected twigs and branches," he laments. "Growers also need to be more careful as the mango death syndrome can easily spread from one farm or orchard to the other," he warned.

According to growers, the syndrome has affected 20 to 30 percent of mango orchards in Sindh [including] areas in lower Sindh where the disease has caused panic among the growers. A mango grower [on] 100 acres [says],
"Around 20 to 25 percent of my crop has been damaged." According to him, Sindh's growers face a similar situation every year, but the problem is more serious this year [2021]. "And no one has bothered to conduct research and come up with a remedy," he laments. [He] connects it to the rise in the temperature during February.

[A local commercial] Fruit Farm also say that mango orchards being plagued by diseases was nothing new, but the damage has been caused to a greater extent this [2021] year. However, research is underway and [they] are hopeful that a solution to the problem would soon be found. Elaborating on the types of diseases, the mango death syndrome consists of various decaying diseases.

[Mango (_Mangifera indica_) is one of the most important fruits worldwide. The term 'mango sudden decline syndrome' (MSDS) is used to describe one or a series of diseases and disease symptoms, including blight, canker, gummosis, twig blight, tip dieback and vascular staining. MSDS (or quick decline, sudden wilt) is of great economic importance since the trees die within a very short time. Countries currently severely affected by MSDS include Pakistan, Oman and Brazil.

Several fungi, including _Lasiodiplodia theobromae_ and _Ceratocystis_ species, have been reported to be associated with MSDS in different areas. It has been suggested that nutrient deficiencies and environmental stress factors may increase the susceptibility of mango trees to sudden decline. Bark beetles (_Hypocryphalus mangiferae_) were shown to carry _C. fimbriata_ and _L. theobromae_ and are also thought to be responsible for transmitting some of the other fungal species.

Some fungicides were found to be helpful if applied quickly enough, but genetic resistance is considered the best means of disease management. Control programmes established in Oman (ProMED-mail post 20091214.4240) use exotic rootstocks from various countries with degrees of resistance to sudden decline which are grafted with scions of local varieties. It is hoped that this will produce trees suitable to local conditions but showing resistance to the pathogens. Screening of indigenous germplasm will be an important means for finding possible genetic resistance in mango varieties for breeding and/or use as rootstocks.
