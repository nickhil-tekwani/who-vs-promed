A measles vaccination "blitz" is underway in schools around Dublin's
north inner city after a surge in the spread of the disease among
local children. Health Service Executive (HSE) public health staff are
offering the MMR vaccine to pupils in a number of primary schools.

There have been 135 reported cases of measles in Ireland since the
start of the year [2011] -- with over 70 percent of them diagnosed in
the north inner [district] of [Dublin] city. Several countries in
Europe have also seen a surge in measles this year, and holiday travel
during the summer months saw a rise in the spread here.

The MMR vaccine is the only protection from measles available from the
HSE. Dr Margaret Fitzgerald, HSE director of public health, said: "We
have seen a rapid increase in the number of measles cases recently,
most of them centred in north Dublin city."

[The number of measles cases in Ireland has remained 135, at least
from 19 Aug 2011 (see Measles update 2011 (28)), so it will be
difficult to assess the effectiveness of this "blitz." - Mod.CP]

Health authorities here on Friday [9 Sep 2011] confirmed increasing
cases of measles in Zanzibar islands, prompting a daily 2-week
[duration] immunization campaign starting next Monday [12 Sep 2011].

"Measles is now a serious problem. We have so far recorded 262 cases
[up from 70 last month (August 2011) - Mod.CP] in both Unguja and
Pemba islands. 40 children are now in hospital," Mr Juma Duni Haji,
Minister of Health, said in a press conference held at the Ministry's
conference hall.

The minister said villages of Pangawe, Kianga, Mtofaani, Magogoni,
Welezo, and Kinuni on Unguja Island [the main island] were most
affected as he appealed to leaders at all levels, religious clerics,
and parents to join in the campaign by promoting awareness.

"In Pemba island, the problem has been recorded in all districts
including Micheweni, Wete, Mkoani, and Chakechake. We need to work
together," he said, adding: "We are working diligently to contain the
measles outbreak and to minimize the outbreak's impact on our
community. We are asking parents to make sure they respond well to the
immunization exercise."

Accompanied at the press conference by officials from WHO, UNICEF, and
from the ministry, the minister attributed the outbreak stubbornness
to low awareness about the importance of measles vaccine, and
negligence by parents. "In our efforts to control the diseases, we
have formed a task force; we have been active on surveillance; we have
opted for daily vaccination, and fortunately, we are working closely
with our development partners WHO and UNICEF," said the minister.

According to the ministry's Principal Secretary (PS), Dr Mohamed Saleh
Dahoma, a nationwide vaccination [campaign] against measles is planned
for November this year [2011]. The PS said measles causes a fever,
runny nose, cough and a rash over the body. The virus [is present] in
the mucus in the nose and throat; when the infected person sneezes or
coughs, the droplets spray into the air and can infect other
individuals. According to the health official, measles is so
contagious that if one person has it, 90 per cent of the people close
to the infected person and not immune from the disease will contract
it.

Health authorities in Barranquilla decreed this afternoon [8 Sep 2011]
a red alert for measles cases in the city, which has already affected
4 people with another as yet unconfirmed case. The news was announced
by the District Health Secretary, Martha Rodriguez. By declaring a red
alert on the basis of 4 confirmed cases and one unconfirmed case, the
health authorities are hoping to prevent further circulation of the
infection. "The EPS, private practitioners and everyone must work
towards cooperation in this effort," she said.

Regarding these new cases, the Secretary of Health said that the only
link is a girl who came from Brazil and who is attending the same
religious school. The 1st case was the child who came from Brazil,
followed subsequently by her mother and brother. The 4th case is not a
relative but a child who regularly attends the same religious school
as the others. The official reported that a 5th case is suspected.

The District Health Secretariat has called for parents to bring their
children to be vaccinated at places arranged by health officials on
Saturday and Sunday [10-11 Sep 2011].

To prevent further transmission of the disease, free vaccination will
be provided for 209 000 children [291 000 in the following report]
aged between 11 and 19 who have not already received 2 immunisations.
The Ministry of Health stated that most of this population has been
identified so far through the school system. However, parents with
children at private schools have not given permission for vaccination
of their children.

A Ministry of Health official, Martha Rodriguez, said that a red alert
has been declared following confirmation of a 4th cases of measles.
This official expressed concern that some private schools [in the
department of Atlantico] had been reported to have denied access to
vaccination staff. The official added that educational institutions
cannot be allowed to adopt policies contrary to the benefit of the
wider community. Parents should bring their children to be vaccinated
at places designated by health authorities this Saturday and Sunday
[11-12 Sep 2011].

Similarly, the Departmental Secretariat of Health announced an amber
health alert throughout the Department of Bolivar and asked employers
in this region of the country to be vigilant for symptoms of rubella
and measles, which might be displayed by patients admitted to
hospitals in the department of Bolivar, as a consequence of the
confirmation of the 4 cases of measles in the city of Barranquilla
[Atlantico department].

The Ministry of Social Protection has distributed 931 000 doses of
vaccines against measles and rubella in the Atlantic coast region as a
preventive measure as follows: in the Atlantico department 164 000
doses, 291 000 doses in Barranquilla, 108 000 doses in Bolivar, 128

The Milwaukee Health Department identified a confirmed case of measles
in a Milwaukee child Wednesday afternoon [7 Sep 2011]. Officials only
say the victim is a refugee child who came to Milwaukee with his
family in late August 2011. He/she may have carried the disease from
abroad but was not contagious while on the plane. The patient is
currently being hospitalized.

Measles is a very contagious and easily-spread illness caused by a
virus. According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine: "The
infection is spread by contact with droplets from the nose, mouth or
throat of an infected person. Sneezing and coughing can put
contaminated droplets into the air."

Symptoms usually begin 8-12 days after you are exposed to the virus.
Symptoms may include bloodshot eyes, cough, fever, sensitivity to
light, muscle pain, rash, redness of the eyes, sore throat and tiny
white spots inside the mouth. There is no specific treatment for
measles. However, bed rest, humidified air and acetaminophen products
like Tylenol may relieve some of the symptoms.

Paul Biedrzychki of the Milwaukee Health Department says the disease
is especially dangerous to young children, people with compromised
immune systems, and pregnant women. The last time Milwaukee dealt with
a case of measles was 2008.

If you have questions or concerns about symptoms you're seeing, call
the Milwaukee Health Department at 414-286-3521 between the hours of 8
a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday.

[Reports of measles cases and outbreaks are beginning decline,
suggesting either reporting fatigue or that enhanced measles
vaccination coverage may be beginning to take effect.

Commencing in September 2010, nearly 100 million children across China
were targeted for measles vaccination, in one of the largest public
health exercises attempted, in an effort to eliminate measles in China
by 2012 (UN News Centre:
http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=35799&Cr=measles&Cr1).
The steady stream of reports reaching HealthMap from different
provinces of China (but not relayed by ProMED-mail because of our
translation limitations) indicate that this aim has not yet been
achieved, although the case numbers are not excessively high in
relation to population size. - Mod.CP]
