Health authorities confirm a 2nd case of measles
---------------------
A Taipei County resident has developed measles after a recent visit
to Japan, the 2nd overseas measles infection this year, health
officials said on Tuesday [12 Jun 2007]. The patient, a 26-year-old
woman living in Banciao, is a Chinese national who has not been
vaccinated against measles, county health officials said.
The woman visited Japan with her Taiwanese husband in mid-May [2007],
when she probably contracted the disease as Japan has been affected
by a measles outbreak since last month [see prior ProMED-mail
postings listed in see also section for background on current measles
outbreak in Japan - Mod.MPP], they said.
The patient is receiving treatment in an isolation ward at a local
hospital, while officials are contacting other members of the woman's
tour group, they said.

[According to the Centers for Disease Control of Taiwan website
(<http://www.cdc.gov.tw/en/> follow links under health topics and
vaccine preventible diseases), with the exception of an outbreak in
1992-1993 and a smaller outbreak in 2002, since 1990 the number of
cases of measles reported annually has been at low levels (it is
difficult to identify the actual number of cases annually from the
graph, but according to the Global Infectious Disease & Epidemiology
Network - GIDEON, the numbers of clinical cases of measles reported
annually in Taiwan were: 1386 in 1988; 44 in 1990; 303 in 1992; 71 in
1993; 101 in 1994; 40 in 1995; 49 in 1996; 63 in 1997; 49 in 1998; 23
in 1999; 48 in 2000; 59 in 2003; 36 in 2004; 39 in 2005; 24 in 2006
-- available at <http://www.gideononline.net>) Taiwan has undertaken
the goal of measles elimination by 2010. Data available at the
website review a vaccination coverage of the cohort born in 2002 of
95 percent with MMR 1st dose. No information was available on 2nd
dose coverages.
The following is excerpted from the Taiwan CDC website: "One of the
major strategies is surveillance. Not only the passive surveillance
such as 'Infectious Disease Reported System' but also the active
surveillance. ....Telephone Interview for Zero Reported System' is
adopted routinely. If there is any suspected case reported, sampling
and investigating will be taken in time.
"Third, the immunization strategies include continuing routine
immunization services; offering free MMR vaccine to those married
women who came from China and Southeast Asia, enhancing the
immunization information system and ensuring vaccine safety and
effectiveness.
"Finally, in order to encourage measles, physicians and other medical
servers who report identified measles case will be awarded 3000 NTD
[USD 90.41].
Immunization strategy:
Immunization
Routine children schedule
The 1st dose of MMR:12-15 months of age
The 2nd dose of MMR: 6 years (1st grade of primary school)"
The inclusion of a monetary reward for reports of cases of measles is
an indication of the seriousness of the government to improve upon
surveillance in order to achieve the goal of measles elimination in
the country. At present, the People's Republic of China and Japan,
both neighboring countries to Taiwan, have ongoing measles activity
and have been associated with importations into other countries, both
neighboring as well as distant (see prior ProMED-mail postings
below). Given today's climate with easy access to international
travel (also better phrased as "we live in a global village"), until
all countries adopt the goal of measles elimination, and include
activities that will "catch up" their own domestic pools of
susceptibles (which includes vaccination strategies aimed at young
adults who are susceptible having been incompletely vaccinated by
today's standards (2 doses of measles containing vaccine) but having
been protected by the herd immunity provided by high levels of
vaccination in their communities, maintenance of a measles free
environment in most countries will be challenged by importations. -
