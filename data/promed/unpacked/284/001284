Mexican authorities were maintaining health alerts in the northeast of the
country after at least seven people died from the mosquito-borne disease,
dengue, officials said on Tuesday. Judith Wong, deputy secretary for
health in the northern border state of Nuevo Leon, said four deaths from
the tropical disease had been confirmed
and another was being investigated. "We have been on alert since August as
the peak months are September and October," she said.
Dengue, considered endemic to parts of northern Mexico, is a prolonged
flu-like viral infection that can cause haemorrhagic fever. The number of
people infected with the disease in Nuevo Leon had reached 5983, 157 of
whom had haemorrhagic fever, Wong said. In 1998, Nuevo Leon recorded 4400
cases of dengue.
In the neighbouring state of Tamaulipas, health authorities said three
people had died this year. Jorge Sebastian Hernandez, head of preventive
medicine in Tamaulipas, said the state was on alert in case the dengue
epidemic in Nuevo Leon spread. He said that so far, 892 cases of dengue had
been reported in Tamaulipas.

[I do not understand what "on alert" means or what the last paragraph
means. Seems like the virus(es?) has already spread to Tamaulipas. The
U.S. border at Texas could be next but likely will not. - Mod.CHC
