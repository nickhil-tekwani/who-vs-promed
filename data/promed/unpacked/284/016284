Dozens of Dutch tourists are spending their holiday in Macedonia in the bathroom rather than at the pool or the beach. A mysterious virus from the nearby Skopje has 2/3rds of the Dutch tourists in the Izgrev Spa & Aqua Park in Ohrid stuck in their hotel rooms.

[A woman] whose daughter is there, confirmed this to the Telegraaf. According to her, the symptoms are vomiting and diarrhea. "The dining room is almost empty. Everywhere people are alone at the table, because the rest of their companions are lying in bed."

[A man] who arrived at the hotel with his family on Friday [14 Aug 2015], told the same story to NOS. "In the breakfast room, I saw only a few people sitting at the tables. All of them were Dutch. When I asked what was going on, it turned out that everyone had diarrhea and was vomiting," he said. "About 80 percent of the Dutch in this hotel are ill at the moment." This family did not escape the virus either. [His] 2 children fell sick on Saturday [15 Aug 2015] with him and his girlfriend following on Sunday [16 Aug 2015]. "We are now 4 days later, and we haven't been able to enjoy a single moment of our holiday."

The hotel has room for about 700 guests; 332 of them are Dutch tourists who traveled through travel agency Corendon. So far, only about 20 people reported to the company that they were sick. All of them were treated for diarrhea. CEO Atilay Uslu told the Telegraaf that the virus has to do with "something in the pool. But I'm not a doctor," he added. The travel company sent 2 employees to the hotel on Tuesday [18 Aug 2015] to assess the situation and talk to the guests.

[Worldwide, norovirus is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach or intestines or both). About one in 5 cases of acute gastroenteritis, which leads to diarrhea and vomiting, is caused by norovirus (see http://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/worldwide.html). Norovirus is more often the cause of acute gastroenteritis among people in developed countries. In developed countries, norovirus causes about one in 5 cases of acute gastroenteritis; in developing countries, it's about one in 6 cases. In contrast, developing countries have more cases of acute gastroenteritis caused by different pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria. So, norovirus accounts for a smaller fraction of all cases in these countries.

With the widespread use of rotavirus vaccine, norovirus has surpassed rotavirus as the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis for which children need medical care in some countries. This trend is likely to continue as other countries routinely vaccinate against rotavirus.

Norovirus infections and outbreaks are usually more common in cooler, winter months. About half of all cases occur from December through February in countries above the equator and in June through August in countries below the equator. However, in places closer to the equator, norovirus may be less seasonal. Or, as in this outbreak, this may be seasonal because of temperature or the timing of the rainy season. Outbreaks may be seasonal when associated with the birth rate.

Worldwide, norovirus is the leading cause of gastroenteritis outbreaks. Noroviruses are diverse and continually diversifying, hence immunity is rarely prolonged. Currently, the most common norovirus strain (genogroup II genotype 4) is a major cause of outbreaks worldwide. New norovirus strains emerge about every 2 to 4 years. Often, but not always, these new strains lead to an increase in outbreaks worldwide. The CDC's Division of Viral Disease works with many global partners to identify the burden of acute gastroenteritis caused by norovirus and to prevent norovirus outbreaks throughout the world. Epidemics occur frequently among travellers and holiday-makers who become exposed to a novel strain.

Norovirus epidemics are also characterised by their "sudden onset and rapid resolution." - Mod.CP
