Two dead after rabid dog bites in Mayom
---------------------------------------
Dr. Talimat Mathiot Chan, the Mayom county health director, told Radio Tamazuj on Thursday [22 Dec 2022] that at least 2 people were confirmed dead recently, and 11 rabid dog bite cases were recorded in the area amid a lack of anti-rabies vaccine at healthcare centres.

"We don't have anti-rabies in hospitals; if we have anti-rabies, we can help ourselves at the PHCC [Primary Health Care Centre] level. We don't take people to the PHCC level because, at the PHCC level, there is no anti-rabies treatment," he said.

"I informed the National Ministry of Health to help us by giving us some anti-rabies, and also the state ministry of health in Unity State will do the same. We submitted our documents requesting anti-rabies," he said.

An 8-year-old Limpopo boy has been confirmed to have rabies.

According to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), the child from Mbokota Village in Limpopo was admitted to the hospital with a fever, confusion, delirium, trouble breathing and hemiplegia.

The boy was diagnosed in December [2022].

During a medical examination, it was found the child had oral ulcers and thrush, discharge from his ears, septic swelling of the lower lip and swelling around the eyes with associated discharge.

He also had signs of mild brain swelling.

Tests confirmed a case of human rabies. The NICD said it was unclear if the boy had been bitten by a dog.

This year [2022], 13 cases of human rabies were reported across the country. The Eastern Cape recorded 7, Limpopo had 4 and KwaZulu-Natal had 2.

https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2022/dec/09/250-rabies-deaths-reported-in-18-indian-states-karnataka-tops-with-32-2526603.html


Nearly 250 deaths due to rabies were reported in the country this year [2022] from 18 states, with Karnataka reporting the highest number of 32 deaths, followed by 24 deaths each from Maharashtra and West Bengal, the Union Health Ministry told the Lok Sabha on Friday [9 Dec 2022].

While Tamil Nadu reported 22 deaths, followed by 21 deaths each from Kerala and Telangana, both Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh recorded 19 deaths each, followed by Delhi and Bihar. Both the states reported 18 deaths each due to rabies, Dr Bharati Pravin Pawar, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, said in the written reply.

The ministry said some deaths have occurred in persons who had been administered post-exposure prophylaxis in Kerala and were sent for repeat quality testing at Central Drugs Laboratory, Kasauli.

"All the tested batches have been reported to be conforming to required quality standards," she said to a question on the testing of samples and quality of vaccines that led to deaths in Kerala, despite being administered to the victims.

The deaths of at least 6 victims, who had taken the anti-rabies vaccine, had triggered a major debate in Kerala over the efficacy of the vaccine. The state reported nearly 2 million dog bites. The central government had dispatched a team following the furore.

The minister said that as per information provided by the Kerala government, all vaccines and immunoglobulin batches had been tested for quality before delivery.

Pawar said the ministry had launched the National Rabies Control since the 12th Five-Year Plan for prevention and control of rabies. The National Rabies Control Program has been implemented in the entire country (Except in Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep).

The minister said various initiatives had been taken, including procurement of an Anti-Rabies Vaccine for animal bite victims through the National Free Drug Initiative, capacity building through training of medical officers and health workers and strengthening surveillance of human rabies and dog bite cases.

She said all the vaccines are tested for standard quality and released by Central Drugs Laboratory, Kasauli.

On what steps the government is taking to ensure the availability of vaccines in the country, she said, all manufacturers have been asked to ensure that the manufacturing of ARV is carried out with total capacity and the first preference may be accorded to meet domestic requirements including government institution supplies in the country.

[The ambiguity about India's official statistics of human rabies incidence, in the past likely significantly underreported to the extreme, has been subject to debate in several postings throughout the year 2022 (recently, in 20221206.8707113). India must base its current rabies control activities, undertaken within its National Action Plan launched in 2021, upon reliable, updated quantitative information of rabies incidence in humans and animals. Surveillance data -- underpinned by effective country reporting and surveillance systems -- is critical to evaluate the progress of national rabies control and elimination campaigns to achieve the goal of the Global Strategic Plan: ending human deaths from dog-mediated rabies by 2030. - Mod.AS]

A 60-year-old man from Sibu is the latest victim of rabies in Sarawak, bringing the total number of cases to 14 this year [2022].

State Health Department director Dr Ooi Choo Huck said the man died at 11.41am on Monday [5 Dec 2022] in Sibu Hospital and a laboratory test confirmed that he had rabies encephalitis.

He said the victim was reported to have experienced symptoms of rabies infection starting 26 Nov 2022.

"He sought treatment at a clinic on 1 Dec 2022 when his symptoms grew worse, including difficulty swallowing, and was referred to Sibu Hospital for further treatment," Dr Ooi said in a statement on Wednesday [7 Dec 2022].

He said the victim was not bitten or scratched by a dog but had handled dog carcasses in October [2022].

However, he said the rabies status of the animals could not be determined.

As rabies is currently endemic in Sarawak, Dr Ooi reminded dog owners to ensure that their pets are vaccinated annually against rabies and to immediately report to the Veterinary Services Department if their dogs turn aggressive or lethargic.

He also urged the public not to handle stray dogs or cats but to report them to the Veterinary Services Department for further investigation.

In addition, he said the Health Department will continue to ensure that dog bite treatment and anti-rabies vaccination are easily accessible to affected individuals.

A total of 26 government health facilities across Sarawak currently offer these services.

"We are making efforts to increase the number of health facilities that can treat and vaccinate animal bite cases, especially in high-risk areas," he said.

[Malaysia's Sabah & Sarawak states (also collectively known as East Malaysia, the Borneo States, and Malaysian Borneo) had become free from rabies in 1999, maintaining this status until August 2015, when the disease recurred. Since then, dog-transmitted cases in humans have been repeatedly reported in spite of dog vaccination efforts.

Rabies is endemic in the canine population in the majority of Southeast Asian countries, where nearly all human rabies infections are transmitted via rabid dog bites. Controlling the disease in dogs, therefore, would be the most effective and cheapest way to prevent rabies in humans. - Mod.AS]

[5] Syria (northwest Syria): suspected, stray dog population

Stray dogs have become a phenomenon visibly prevalent in the neighborhoods and streets of cities and towns in northwestern Syria, causing panic among residents, especially children. These animals have become a source of nuisance and fear due to the pathogenic viruses they carry.

The spread of stray dogs has been accompanied by the announcement of deaths and injuries to people as a result of exposure to bites, amid initiatives by local bodies and personal initiatives to limit their spread through vaccination campaigns or shooting these dogs in some cases.

The most recent case of humans affected by stray dogs was announced by the Syria Civil Defense on 13 Dec 2022, when it said that its teams had taken a child to the hospital to receive treatment after he was bitten by a dog in the al-Bir camp near the village of Batbo in the western countryside of Aleppo.

The Civil Defense stated on Facebook that the cases of exposure to dog bites have recently increased in areas of northwestern Syria, suggesting that their complications could lead to death.

[AZ], 42, male, died on 29 Nov 2022 after being bitten by a rabid dog 3 days earlier [see Mod comment] in the village of Trinda in Afrin, north of Aleppo.

On 2 Nov 2022, a child was bitten by a rabid dog on a farm in the countryside of Jisr al-Shughour, west of Idlib. The Syria Civil Defense took him to the hospital for treatment.

Telegram channels (prevalent in the region) post almost daily incidents of people, especially children, being attacked by stray dogs. Victims are being taken to clinics close to where these accidents occurred.

Enab Baladi's correspondents polled the views of some people in the Idlib and Aleppo countryside. They expressed concerns about the spread of stray dogs that are attacking children, in particular, being unable to resist or escape from them. Some dogs attack motorcycles, causing numerous accidents and damages.

In each case, the Civil Defense recommends that parents pay attention to their children and not approach stray dogs and the abandoned places in which they spread to ensure their safety.

The region's residents have increasingly demanded, through social media, that some departments and concerned authorities take action through campaigns to vaccinate stray dogs or even to put them down by shooting them.

On 26 Oct 2022, the local council in the city of Darkush in the western countryside of Idlib launched a campaign to combat stray dogs, setting a curfew appointment after 11 p.m., given the large number of dogs in the late night hours.

A member of the Darkush Local Council, Mohammad Abdo, told Enab Baladi that stray dogs had spread heavily in the city's neighborhoods and streets, particularly in places where there is no high population density or large human populations.

The council received numerous complaints about the spread of dogs being harmful and striking panic and fear in the hearts of the people, in addition to fears of diseases resulting from them attacking people.

Abdo added that the local council's campaign included returning the dog to its owner if it was identified and recommending putting a leash on it, and killing ferocious dogs while burying them in a sanitary way that does not cause odors and diseases.

The Directorate of Agriculture and Livestock of the Azaz Local Council in the northern countryside of Aleppo launched a vaccination campaign for domestic dogs against the rabies virus to ensure their safe presence among the people after the spread of stray dogs in the city's neighborhoods and the existence of several cases in which these dogs attacked many residents.

The campaign launched by the Agriculture Office in Azaz has been ongoing since 23 Nov 2022, and it also included stray dogs. A specialized veterinary team administers the required vaccinations to the animals to ensure that they do not develop rabies.

Fadi al-Ajlan, director of the Agriculture Office in the Azaz Local Council, told Enab Baladi that the main reason for launching the campaign is that children and women have been attacked by some stray dogs in the city's neighborhoods. Some of these dogs were found to have rabies and began transmitting the infection to other dogs.

The Azaz Local Council's campaign is based on administering an approved vaccine imported from Turkey to domestic dogs by a specialized veterinary medical team, pointing out that whenever a dog is infected with rabies, it cannot benefit from the vaccine given, so it is put down immediately.

Al-Ajlan added that a dog infected with rabies dies 3 to 7 days after the disease contaminates its nerve cells and its brain. It is either quarantined until it dies, or it is shot and then disposed of and buried in designated areas.

With regard to diseases transmitted by stray dogs, a veterinarian, Rashid al-Junaid, previously explained to Enab Baladi that the most important diseases are Echinococcosis, cystic echinococcosis, Giardia infection (Giardiasis), allergies in children, skin diseases, and Dermatophytosis (ringworm).

The most serious and widespread disease of them all is rabies, transmitted to people by the saliva of the infected dog, whether by licking or biting. The virus does not die and is not affected by the use of topical antiseptics that are used to disinfect wounds.

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines rabies as a vaccine-preventable, zoonotic, viral disease. Once clinical symptoms appear, rabies is virtually 100% fatal. In up to 99% of cases, domestic dogs are responsible for rabies virus transmission to humans.

Yet, rabies can affect both domestic and wild animals. It is spread to people and animals through bites or scratches, usually via saliva.

Every year, more than 29 million people worldwide receive a post-bite vaccination. This is estimated to prevent hundreds of thousands of rabies deaths annually, says WHO.

Rabies is one of the Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) (a diverse group of 20 conditions that are mainly prevalent in tropical areas, where they mostly affect impoverished communities in tropical and subtropical countries). It predominantly affects poor and vulnerable populations who live in remote rural locations. Approximately 80% of human cases occur in rural areas.

The WHO mentioned 3 ways to prevent rabies: to get rid of it in dogs with vaccines, raise awareness about rabies, prevent dog bites, and immunize people before and after exposure to the disease.

The WHO published some facts about rabies; it occurs in more than 150 countries and territories. The infection causes tens of thousands of deaths every year, mainly in Asia and Africa.

Approximately 40% of people bitten by suspected rabid animals are children under 15 years of age.

Immediate, thorough wound washing with soap and water after contact with a suspect rabid animal is crucial and can save lives.

WHO leads the "United Against Rabies" initiative to drive progress towards "Zero human deaths from dog-mediated rabies by 2030".

The Veterinary Sanitary and Food Safety Directorate (DSVSA), Suceava, has announced that a new case of rabies has been confirmed in the county, this time in cattle. It is a cow from a farm in Slobozia village, Zvoriștea commune.

In total, there are 35 cattle, 4 dogs, 4 cats and 4 pigs on the farm. The dogs and cats have been vaccinated since 20 Dec 2022, and the vaccination campaign will be extended to all animals in the holding and then in the outbreak.

On Tuesday [20 Dec 2022] the Local Disease Control Center met to approve the measures to prevent rabies following this new case.

"We want all citizens to be aware of the seriousness of the disease, as well as the obligation to notify the community veterinarian of any abnormal behavior of animals in the household, especially dogs and cats, as well as any case of animal mortality.

"We recommend that, in the future, the staff who serve the homeless dog shelters or the people who own a larger number of dogs or cats in their households request the Directorate of Public Health, for anti-rabies vaccination", is the appeal sent by Dr. Dănuț Corneanu, the deputy director of DSVSA Suceava.

This is the 5th case of rabies confirmed in Suceava county, the others being in dogs from Siret and Grămești.

The case from Slobozia-Zvoriștea is the first in cattle in the county and in Sirețel-Pașcani there is an outbreak with 12 cases of rabies in cattle and 6 in foxes.

Against this dangerous background, the people of Suceava are asked to collaborate with veterinarians for anti-rabies vaccination of dogs and cats in households. The most effective way to reduce the risk of rabies is the rabies vaccine, which promotes the production of antibodies.

The anti-rabies vaccine is part of a series of compulsory vaccines, being included in the vaccination scheme for animals, young dogs/cats, and subsequently, through annual repetitions. However, many owned dogs, even purebred dogs, have not yet been vaccinated.

The Suceava Directorate of Public Health announced that following the epidemiological investigation in Zvoriștea, 6 people were identified who were in contact with the animal diagnosed with rabies -- 4 people from the family and 2 veterinarians. The 4 family members were already vaccinated on Tuesday [20 Dec 2022] at the County Hospital; the 2 veterinarians are to present themselves for vaccination.

Suceava DPH announced that it permanently monitors the availability of the anti-rabies vaccine in all hospital units in the county.

The Sverdlovsk authorities announced a quarantine for animal rabies in one of the districts of Yekaterinburg. It will last until 10 Feb 2023, the Uralinformburo reports.

The corresponding order of the governor of the region Yevgeny Kuyvashev is published in the latest issue of the Yekaterinburg Bulletin. According to the document, quarantine restrictions are caused by a case of rabies in a dog, identified in the capital of the Urals in early December [2022].

The epizootic focus is located in Lechebny microdistrict. The area within a radius of 3 kilometers [1.86 mi] is under the restrictions.

A number of bans are introduced in the designated location until the end of the quarantine period.

Earlier, a similar quarantine was announced in the village of Bolshoi Istok, where rabies was detected in a rat that had bitten one of the local residents [see Mod comment].

Rabies is an acute, deadly infectious disease. The behavior of an infected animal changes greatly: it becomes either aggressive or very affectionate, exhibits profuse salivation, light and hydrophobia, and paralysis appears. If bitten by an infected animal, rabies immunoglobulin and vaccine should be administered as soon as possible.

https://www.alt.kp.ru/daily/27485.5/4693673/


Cases of rabies have been detected in 4 settlements of the Altai Territory. Vladimir Samodurov, head of the regional veterinary department, spoke at a press conference about the source of the infection and how the problem is being solved.

"One of the problematic diseases we have is rabies. I put it on the 1st level, because both animals and people get sick with it. Today in the region we have 4 unfavorable points for this disease," Vladimir Samodurov explained.

Three cases were identified in rural areas of the Altai Territory (Charyshsky, Volchikhinsky, Zarinsky) and one in Barnaul. Most often, foxes were the primary source of infection, from which dogs were then infected.

"In one case, in the territory of Zarinsky district," explained the head of the regional veterinary department, "a fox came into contact with a sheep, as a result of which this disease was detected first by clinical signs, and then confirmed by laboratory tests".

More than 600 000 animals have already been vaccinated against rabies in the Altai Territory. In addition, in 59 municipalities, baited vaccine for oral vaccination were spread, near holes of wildlife, in cooperation with representatives of hunting grounds and rangers.

Between 2019 and 2022, 40 outbreaks of rabies have been registered in the Altai region (2019 - 20, 2020 - 8, 2021 - 11, 2022 - 1).

The region is surrounded by active natural foci of rabies, so the risk of the disease increases during outdoor recreation, summer cottages, hunting and fishing with your pets. The incubation period for the disease ranges from 10 days to 3-4 months, the pathogen can be in the saliva of a sick animal 10 days before the 1st signs of the disease appear (profuse salivation, difficulty swallowing, and convulsions).

Dogs remain the main source of infection for humans from domestic animals, and from wild ones -- foxes, raccoon dogs, wolves. In addition, human infection is also possible from cats, cows, sheep, goats, pigs, horses, donkeys, rats and other animals.

A person can become infected when bitten by sick animals, as well as when the saliva of animals gets on wounds on the skin or mucous membranes. Especially dangerous are bites to the head, face, and hands.

[In view of the paucity of reports from Syria in our archive, the report in item 5 is presented in its entirety, (almost) without omissions, in order to allow the reader a full and undisturbed impression of the exhaustive description and various aspects of the rabies situation in post-war Syria. In fact, hard data -- including number of confirmed rabies cases, in humans and per animal species, are still to be obtained.

The information about a man (42) who allegedly died on 29 Nov 2022 "after being bitten by a rabid dog 3 days earlier" needs to be rechecked; a rather short time gap between exposure and disease. Information on diagnostic tests applied and their results will be helpful.

Additional information from Syria, including from its other regions, will be appreciated.

Rabies is known to be recorded continuously, since the past several years, in jackals and stray dogs of Israel's borders with south-western Syria, southern Lebanon and north-west Jordan (see Israel's dynamic rabies map for 2022 at https://tinyurl.com/43ekktfj; jackals are indicated by aqua, dogs by purple violet circles). - Mod.AS
