Rabbit owners are being urged to make sure their pets are properly inoculated following a suspected outbreak of viral haemorrhagic disease (VHD) [see comment] in Maidstone [England].

There is no treatment for VHD, and it usually leads to a slow and painful death for rabbits. The animals often show no outward signs of illness but those that survive can spread the disease.

Rae Todd, of the Rabbit Welfare Association & Fund (RWAF), said: "All pet rabbits should be given annual inoculations, but this suspected outbreak gives added urgency to the situation."

[Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD), also known as viral haemorrhagic disease (VHD), is a highly contagious and acute fatal disease of the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_), caused by a calicivirus (genus _Lagovirus_).

RHD is characterised by high morbidity and high mortality (70-90 percent), and spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission. Infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival, or oral routes. Transmission of RHD is facilitated by the high stability of the virus in the environment. The incubation period varies from 1 to 3 days, and death usually occurs 12-36 hours after the onset of fever. The clinical manifestations have been described mainly in the acute infection and are nervous and respiratory signs, apathy, and anorexia. Clear and specific lesions, both gross and microscopic, are present. There is primary liver necrosis and a massive disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in all organs and tissues. The most severe lesions are in the liver, trachea, and lungs. Petechiae are evident in almost all organs and are accompanied by poor blood coagulation. In rabbits younger than 4-5 weeks, the RHDV infection course is subclinical.

The information above was derived from OIE's Terrestrial Manual (chapter 2.6.2); the disease is one of the 2 lagomorph diseases reportable to the OIE. The following vaccination guidelines are derived from the same source:

"Most vaccine manufacturers recommend a single basic vaccination, with yearly booster. Normally, a 1-ml dose is inoculated subcutaneously in the neck region, or intramuscularly. The 1st injection should be given at 2-3 months. In those units with no history of disease, where the anamnesis for RHD is negative, it is advisable to vaccinate only the breeding stock. Considering the high restocking rate in industrial rabbit farms, the usual vaccination programme is to administer the vaccine to all breeders, independently of their age, every 6 months. This should ensure that all animals get at least one vaccination per year. Booster vaccination is strongly recommended to ensure a good level of protection, although experimental data indicate that protection usually lasts for a long time (over 1 year).

"Given the short life-cycle (approximately 80 days) of fattening rabbits and their natural resistance to the disease until 35-40 days of age, vaccinating these rabbits is not necessary if the situation on the farm is normal, i.e. good biosecurity measures are applied and there are no outbreaks of the disease in the area. Following an outbreak of RHD, even if strict hygiene and sanitary measures are adopted, including cleaning and disinfection, safe disposal of carcasses and an interval before restocking, it is strongly recommended to vaccinate meat animals at the age of 40 days, because the incidence of re-infection is very high. Only after several production cycles is it advisable to stop vaccination of meat animals. To verify the persistence of infective RHD inside the unit, a variable number of rabbits, starting with a small sentinel group, should not be vaccinated.

"Given that immunity starts after about 7-10 days, vaccination could also be considered a quite effective post-exposure treatment. In some situations in particular it may be included in the emergency strategies applied when RHD occurs on those farms having separate sheds and where good biosecurity measures are regularly applied. Indeed, better results in limiting the diffusion of the disease and reducing economic losses could be obtained by using serotherapy through the parenteral administration of anti-RHDV hyperimmune sera, which produces a rapid, but short-lived, protection against RHDV infection.

Vaccine should be stored at 2-8 deg C and it should not be frozen, or exposed to bright light or high temperatures."

RHD was 1st reported in 1984 in the People's Republic of China. Currently, it is endemic in East Asia, Europe (including the UK), and Oceania. Outbreaks have also been recorded in Central America (Mexico and Cuba), USA, Saudi Arabia, and West and North Africa. It appeared recently for the 1st time in Canada.
