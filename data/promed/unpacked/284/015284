Poliovirus in sewage samples -- Southern Israel -- update
---------------------------------------------------------
Sewage samples collected in Rahat and Beer Sheba are part of routine environmental surveillance for poliovirus implemented in Israel since the polio outbreak of 1988. Samples are collected monthly from selected sites in Israel which either represent large populations or are known to be at high risk for importation of wild poliovirus.

The samples are processed at the Central Virology Laboratory of the Israel Ministry of Health at Tel-Hashomer. Poliovirus is isolated from the sewage samples by infecting recombinant mouse cell line L20B according to WHO guidelines. Individual plaques or tube cultures are then analyzed by real-time PCR using the CDC analytical kits designed for identification of polioviruses and differentiation between vaccine and wild types, and identification confirmed by sequencing.

On [3 Jun 2013] wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) was detected in 2 sewage samples taken in Beer Sheba, one on [9 Apr 2013] and the other on [13 May 2013]. Beer Sheba is a city with a population of about 200 000, 20 km [12.4 mi] south of Rahat, the town where the virus was first detected from a sample taken on [9 Apr 2013]. Beer Sheba is the nearest commercial center to Rahat, and there is considerable communication between these towns.

The samples collected in Rahat yielded an exceptionally large number of plaques on L20B cells while the samples from Beer Sheba yielded only a few plaques. Representative isolates from Rahat and all isolates from Beer Sheba were then analyzed and identified as non-Sabin poliovirus type 1. Further analysis by PCR and sequencing revealed that these isolates belong to the SOAS [South Asia] lineage of wild poliovirus type 1 which circulates in Pakistan and Afghanistan, and which was also isolated from sewage in Egypt in December 2012.

Nowhere in the country have any polio cases been identified.
The following actions were decided upon:
1. In Rahat and villages on the same sewage collection line: outreach to complete childhood vaccination for all children and to administer IPV [inactivated poliovirus vaccine] to all adults without evidence of prior vaccination after the age of 18 [years], with special attention to sanitation workers and to immigrants who illegally entered Israel through Egypt. Publicity campaign to raise awareness to hand-washing and personal hygiene. Sewage sampling will be done weekly, and attempts made to pinpoint source(s) by sampling sewage within Rahat and surrounding villages.
2. In the nearby metropolis (Beer Sheba): outreach to complete childhood vaccination for all children up to age 6. Emphasis on completion of school vaccination which includes a dose of dTaP-IPV [diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis-inactivated poliovirus vaccine] at the age of 7 years old.
3. Nationwide: active AFP [acute flaccid paralysis] surveillance will be extended to include all individuals, irrespective of age. Sewage samples taken since March [2013] in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Gaza, and the Palestinian authority will be revisited for presence of WPV1. The need for bringing children up to date on their routine vaccinations is emphasized.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr Emilia Anis and colleagues in the Public Health Services, Ministry of Health, Israel, for sharing this information with us.

As the WPV1 isolate was identified as similar to the WPV1 identified in environmental (sewage) samples in Egypt earlier this year (2012) (see ProMED-mail Poliomyelitis - worldwide (01): Egypt ex Pakistan, Niger 20130122.1509210) one suspects that the virus' itinerary was most likely Afghanistan/Pakistan to Egypt, to Israel. Rahat and Beer Sheba are located in the south of Israel not far from the border with Egypt (see http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/israel_map2.htm for a map of Israel showing the location of Beer Sheba and its relative proximity to Egypt).

Given the high levels of vaccination coverage in Israel, the recommended strategies of trying to capture those individuals with incomplete vaccination histories, especially those considered at high risk of exposure and transmission in the 2 areas where WPV1 has been identified, as well as a nationwide catch up vaccination effort, are highly appropriate.
