The Ghana Health Service (GHS) has said one close contact in the new Marburg virus disease cases in Ghana reported symptoms after the maximum incubation period, the person tested positive together with his close contact (yet to be corroborated by IPD) but died on 21 Jul 2022.

Currently, 40 additional contacts have been identified in the Savannah Region and are being followed up.

Of the 40 contacts, 11 are healthcare workers (HCW), and daily monitoring of temperature and general health and wellbeing are being undertaken by healthcare staff in the affected district.

The Director-General of the GHS, Dr Patrick Kuma-Aboagye made this known at a press briefing in Accra on Sunday (24 Jul 2022).

Marburg virus disease in Ghana
------------------------------
The GHS on 26 Jun 2022, identified a suspected case of viral haemorrhagic fever [VHF] whose date of onset was 22 Jun 2022. It resulted in 2 fatalities.

The Noguchi Memorial Institute of Medical Research (NMIMR) confirmed Marburg virus disease on 7 Jul 2022. The results were subsequently corroborated by Institut Pasteur in Dakar (IPD) on 15 Jul 2022.

The 2 earlier fatal cases of Marburg virus disease (MVD) were reported in the Ashanti region.

In the 1st case, it was a 26-year-old male who was a farm worker in Adansi North district in the Ashanti region with a travel history to the Western region. Prior to symptom onset on 24 Jun 2022, he arrived from the Western region to Ashanti region. He sought care at a hospital on 26 Jun 2022 and died on 27 Jun 2022. The case was transported and buried in the Sawla-Tuna-Kalba district in the Savannah region, which borders both Burkina Faso and CÃ´te d'Ivoire. The burial was conducted before the results of laboratory tests for MVD were available.

The 2nd case was a 51-year-old male who was a farm worker in the Bekwai Municipality of the Ashanti region.

An outbreak of MVD has only been reported once previously in West Africa, and this is the 1st time MVD has been notified in Ghana. An outbreak of MVD may represent a serious public health threat as it is severe and often fatal, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).

The 2nd case from NMIMR is yet to be corroborated by IPD, Dr Kuma-Aboagye said at the press briefing on Sunday [24 Jul 2022].

He added that in a follow-up of the case, clinical notes suggested the case does not meet the VHF definition and that a chronic case of peptic ulcer disease.

Further investigation is being conducted and that all contacts of the "case-patient" have completed the mandatory 21-day quarantine and are all well.

Dr Kuma-Aboagye said the implementation of several interventions with focus on 3 regions; Ashanti, Savannah, and Western is underway and that a cumulative list of 118 contacts in 3 districts in the 3 regions was identified -- Ashanti, 50; Savannah, 48, and Western, 20.

Of the contacts 19 were HCWs, 99 were close family members or household/community contacts and all contacts have completed the mandatory 21-day follow-up as of 21 Jul 2022.

It is from this that one close contact reported symptoms after the maximum incubation period, tested positive together with his close contact (yet to be corroborated by IPD), and died on 21 Jul 2022.

Dr Kuma-Aboagye said currently, 40 additional contacts have been identified in the Savannah Region and are being followed up, 11 of the 40 contacts are healthcare workers.

Public health actions
---------------------
The Director-General of the GHS said other measures being implemented include alerts sent to all districts, community engagements -- intensive risk communication in the affected region, and further investigations on the ongoing outbreak.

- Constitution of a rapid response team (GHS and partners) to support the regional and district response teams for detailed investigations
- Clinical records review and sensitisation of clinical staff
- Support with contact tracing and follow-up
- Provision of more PPEs and other logistics by GHS/MOH and Partners
- Development of training tools and education materials
- Training on community-based surveillance for volunteers and supervisors
- Total of 60 CBSV [community-based surveillance volunteers], 12 CHOs [community health officers] (as supervisors), and 8 other staff (as coordinators) trained
- Additional training ongoing
- Development of National Response Plan

Next steps
----------
- To enhance community engagement
- To monitor all contacts for 42 days
- To offer psychological support to families
- To train CBSVs to do case search and contact tracing
- To enhance risk communication activities
- Environmental Assessment by Wildlife at affected districts (Adansi North, Bekwai, Prestea Huni Valley, STK)
- Collaborating with Wildlife and Partners to conduct a nationwide Risk Assessment
- Additional sample of 2nd case for confirmation

[The occurrence of a Marburg virus fatal infection is unfortunate but a good illustration of the need for surveillance of contact individuals.

As noted above and in the previous post, this is not the 1st time that Marburg virus has been found in West Africa. Last year (2021) there were 2 confirmed cases of Marburg hemorrhagic fever in Gueckedou, the Republic of Guinea. Although these were the 1st confirmed human infections with this virus in West Africa, the virus was found previously in neighboring Sierra Leone in 5 Egyptian rousettes, or fruit, bats (_Rousettus aegyptiacus_) (see Marburg virus disease - Sierra Leone: bat 20200125.6916732 and Amman BR, Bird H, Bakarr I A, et al. Nat Commun. 2020; 11:510; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-14327-8).

Tests for Marburg virus infections should be among those for hemorrhagic diseases that are endemic in West Africa for timely and accurate differential diagnosis. - Mod.TY
