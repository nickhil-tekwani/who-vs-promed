News of the response
Beni Emergency Operations Center
----------------------------
- A MONUSCO plumber working at the coordination headquarters in Beni tested positive for Ebola and is currently hospitalized at the ETC in Beni.
- The plumber would have been contaminated after having stayed at the center of a traditional health practitioner where a confirmed case was cared for before transfer to the ETC. The surveillance team has already started the investigation to identify all contacts and prevent transmission of the virus.
- The response teams, most of whom had already been vaccinated before deployment, had to leave headquarters earlier this Friday [12 Oct 2018] so that a team of hygienists could begin the disinfection work of the entire site. In addition, the plumber's colleagues have voluntarily registered to be vaccinated as of this Sat 13 Oct [2018]. As a precaution, they were all put on paid leave for 21 days.

Vaccination
-----------
- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 16 202 people have been vaccinated, including 6163 in Beni, 4289 in Mabalako, 1663 in Mandima, 1392 in Katwa, 1085 in Butembo, 460 in Masereka, 434 in Bunia, 355 in Tchomia, 240 in Komanda, and 121 in Oicha.

News of the response
Epidemiological surveillance
----------------------------
- Since the beginning of October [2018], a significant increase in the number of new cases has been observed, mainly in Beni.
- Between 1 and 11 Oct 2018, 39 new cases were reported, of which 32 were in Beni, representing 82% of all cases reported during this period.
- Specifically, 35 of all new cases were reported between 4 and 11 Oct 2018 (the past 7 days prior to this report). Of these 35 cases, 29 (82%) were in Beni.

A dignified and safe burial
--------------------------
- On Wed 10 Oct 2018, members of the community stole the body of a woman who died at the Beni ETC on her way to the cemetery. When the woman died, the family asked the response team to make some concessions regarding the burial ceremony of the deceased. In particular, they requested that the hearse be driven by one of their acquaintances and that 5 family members wear personal protective equipment to carry the casket. This request was accepted by the response team, provided that the procession was followed by a police vehicle.
- However, as the procession made its way to the cemetery, the driver of the hearse suddenly changed course to rush back to the family plot in the Butsili district of Beni City. Arriving at the plot, several young people from a nearby neighborhood then violently chased the police and kept the body with them. Panicking and realizing their mistake, the youth finally went to the cemetery before the end of the day and let the 5 family members wearing the personal protective equipment proceed with the burial of the deceased.
- This Thu 11 Oct 2018, several members of the family voluntarily presented themselves to the General Referral Hospital of Beni to be vaccinated. They guaranteed that no one had manipulated the body of the deceased between the ETC and the cemetery. Neither the coffin nor the body bag was opened.
- In addition, residents of the Butsili neighborhood held a special meeting on Thu 11 Oct 2018 at the neighborhood office and made a statement of apology to the response teams. Young people in the neighborhood promised that they would not let such a situation happen again in their neighborhood.

[The update numbers reflect a dramatic surge in cases, mainly in Beni, which can largely be attributed to the suspension of control efforts, especially contact tracing, which followed the 22 Sep 2018 armed attack in Beni. This has been compounded by isolated incidents of family and community resistance, exemplified by the dramatic burial vignette described above. More than 16 000 individuals have now been vaccinated against Ebola, but the case of the infected MONUSCO plumber reported in the 12 Oct 2018 update raises the question of whether vaccination should be extended to an even broader range of workers deployed to the affected region. These developments have been covered in one way or another by many news outlets in the past 2 days, but the CIDRAP report below is perhaps the most comprehensive. - Mod.LXL]

[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

With 11 new Ebola cases confirmed yesterday and today [11-12 Oct 2018], the Democratic Republic of Congo's (DRC) Ebola outbreak total climbed to 205 cases, amid a new warning from the World Health Organization (WHO) that the security problems are getting worse and threaten to undermine the response, especially in Beni, the main hot spot.

As if to underscore the WHO's concerns, the DRC's health ministry yesterday [11 Oct 2018] described how community members stole the body of a woman who died at an Ebola treatment center (ETC) as she was on her way to the cemetery to be buried, violently chasing off police before changing their mind and returning the body to the cemetery.

Then in its update today [12 Oct 2018], the health ministry said that because of an Ebola illness in someone working at response headquarters in Beni, the office was temporarily shuttered so that the location could be disinfected.

Of the 11 new cases reported by the Ministry of Health, 6 were reported yesterday [11 Oct 2018] and 5 today [12 Oct 2018]. Of these new cases, 8 are from Beni, plus one each from Masereka, Kalunguta, and Mabalako, raising the overall total to 205 cases, 170 of them confirmed and 35 classified as probable. The case-patient from Kalungata reflects a community death, and 7 other deaths were reported, all in Beni, raising the fatality count to 130. Health officials are still investigating 32 suspected Ebola infections, which is up from 25 suspected cases 2 days ago [10 Oct 2018].

In its update yesterday [11 Oct 2018], the DRC said that, since early October [2018], a significant increase in the number of new confirmed cases has come mainly from Beni. Of 39 new confirmed cases reported during the first 11 days of October [2018], 32 (82%) were from the city, which has recently experienced conflict between rebel and armed groups, with resulting protests, and pockets of community resistance.

Regarding the cemetery incident, the health ministry said that the response team had made some concessions to the family, allowing a friend to drive the hearse and 5 family members to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) to carry the woman's casket. As part of the deal with the family, a police vehicle followed the procession to the cemetery.

However, the friend driving the hearse suddenly changed course to take the woman to a family plot in Beni's Butsili district, where young people from the neighborhood violently chased police and took the body. Then the group panicked and returned to the cemetery later in the day, where family members wearing PPE buried the body.

Yesterday [11 Oct 2018], several members of the family involved in the incident voluntarily went to Beni General Hospital for vaccination and said no one had manipulated the body between the ETC and the cemetery. Officials said neither the coffin nor the burial bag had been opened. In addition, residents of the neighborhood where police were chased and the woman's body taken held a meeting and apologized to response teams, with the neighborhood's young people promising to not let the situation happen again.

In today's update [12 Oct 2018], the health ministry said one of the new cases involves a plumber from the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the DRC (MONUSCO) who was working at the outbreak coordination headquarters in Beni. The plumber is hospitalized at an ETC in the city.

Investigators found that the man had stayed at the center of a traditional healer where an earlier confirmed Ebola patient was seen before he or she was taken to an ETC. Most of the response team at the MONUSCO office had been vaccinated, but the team had to leave headquarters today [12 Oct 2018] so that the entire site could be disinfected. According to the health ministry, the plumber's coworkers have volunteered to be vaccinated and were put on paid leave for 21 days as a precaution.

In its weekly overview of the outbreak, the WHO said the latest surge in cases reflects complex challenges that responders face, such as conflicts between rebel and government forces and pockets of community push-back. It notes, however, that some of the increase represents improved surveillance and community reporting.

Worryingly, of 29 cases reported since the WHO's last update on 2 Oct 2018, 15 were from known transmission chains, but exposures for 14 others are still under investigation. Cases without known links to other patients hint that the disease is circulating undetected in parts of the affected area, posing a high risk of further spread. The WHO said the latest increase in cases probably underestimates the burden of the disease, given delays in case reporting, ongoing sporadic cases, and security concerns that hamper contact tracing and investigation of possible illnesses.

One more health worker infection was reported since the WHO's last update, raising that total to 20 so far, which includes 3 deaths.

In Butembo, safe burial teams from the Red Cross suspended activities indefinitely, following a 2 Oct 2018 attack on volunteers, and civil protection teams are currently handling the burials there. However, 32 of 236 responses were unsuccessful because of community refusal or burials conducted before the teams arrived. In addition, 7 alerts were not answered because of security concerns.

Meanwhile, burial team capacity in Beni is being strengthened because of an expected increase in deaths. The WHO said Beni's mayor recently announced that all deaths must be accompanied by a death certificate, and rapid diagnostic testing is being considered as part of validation for hospital and community deaths.

[2] DNA vaccine for Ebola tested in animals
Date: Wed 10 Oct 2018
Source: UPI [abridged, edited]
https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2018/10/10/DNA-vaccine-shows-promising-long-term-results-against-Ebola-virus/3821539187290/


A synthetic DNA vaccine is showing immediate and long-term promising results against the Ebola virus in preclinical animal research. Scientists at the Wistar Institute Vaccine and Immunotherapy Centers designed optimized synthetic DNA vaccine candidates that target a virus surface protein called glycoprotein. The findings were published Wed 10 Oct 2018 in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.

"Synthetic non-viral based DNA technology allows for rapid vaccine development by delivery directly into the skin, resulting in consistent, potent and rapid immunity compared to traditional vaccine approaches," lead researcher Dr. David B. Weiner, executive vice president and director of Wistar's Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center, said in a press release. "An anti-Ebola virus DNA vaccine like this may provide an important new tool for protection, and we are excited to see what future studies will unveil."

Other promising experimental vaccines are being developed, but they may be associated with side effects and may not be applicable for specific vulnerable people, including children, pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals, the researchers noted. In addition, these drug candidates do not provide long-term protection.

The Wistar researchers found their novel vaccine showed strong immune responses immediately and one year after the last dose in animals. A shorter, dose-sparing, immunization regimen was administered directly into the skin. The detected antibody levels were equal to or higher than those reported for other vaccines being evaluated in the clinic, according to the study.

"The success of intradermal delivery of a low-dose regimen is very encouraging," said Dr. Ami Patel, an associate staff scientist at the Wistar Institute, which is based in Philadelphia. "The ultimate goal of our work is to create effective and safe vaccines that are optimized for field use in at-risk areas."

[The prospect of DNA vaccines, which can be rapidly devised and tested, makes this platform especially attractive for emerging infectious diseases. DNA vaccines have thus far proven very safe in human subjects, but the robust immune responses seen in animal models have not been replicated in humans. Thus, whereas a few DNA vaccines have been approved for animals (such as West Nile virus vaccine for horses), no DNA vaccine has yet been approved for humans.
