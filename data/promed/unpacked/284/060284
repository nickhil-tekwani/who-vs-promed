Headlines
- Nigeria marked 3 years since the last case of wild poliovirus (WPV) was detected within its borders. Because Nigeria is the last polio-endemic country in Africa, this milestone opens the door for the potential WPV-free certification of the entire WHO AFRO region after the Africa Regional Certification Commission (ARCC) evaluation as early as mid-2020. While this is an important programmatic milestone, the region has not yet been certified polio-free, and it will be critical for [the] polio programme to maintain momentum.

Summary of new viruses this week:
- Afghanistan - 1 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case;
- Pakistan - 1 WPV1-positive environmental sample;
- Angola - 1 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) case;
- Ghana - 1 [cVDPV2] case.

Afghanistan
- 1 WPV1 case has been reported in the past week from Chora district, Uruzgan province, with onset of paralysis on [16 Jul 2019]. There are 13 WPV1 cases reported in 2019. [There] were 21 WPV1 cases reported in 2018.
- No WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week.

Pakistan
- No WPV1 cases were reported in the past week. There are 53 WPV1 cases in 2019, and 12 WPV1 cases were reported in 2018.
- 1 WPV1-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week from Quetta district, Balochistan province. The samples were collected on [28 Jul 2019].

Nigeria
- No cases of cVDPV2 were reported in the past week. There are 16 cVDPV2 cases reported in 2019. There were 34 cVDPV2 cases in 2018.
- No cVDPV2-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week.

Lake Chad
- No case of cVDPV2 has been reported in the past week.
- In the Lake Chad region, cVDPV2 linked to the outbreak originating in Nigeria has been detected in Niger (1 case in 2019 and 10 cases in 2018) and Cameroon (1 positive environmental sample, collected on [20 Apr 2019] in Extreme Nord).
- The risk of further cVDPV2 spread across the Lake Chad subregion remains high.

Ghana
- 1 cVDPV2 case was reported in the past week from Chereponi district, Northern province, with onset of paralysis on [23 Jul 2019]. This is the 1st cVDPV2 case in 2019. Earlier, a cVDPV2 was isolated from an environment sample collected on [11 Jun 2019] from the Northern province. Both the isolates are linked to [the] Jigawa cVDPV2 outbreak in Nigeria.
- The risk of further cVDPV2 spread across West Africa remains high.
- Surveillance is being strengthened in neighbouring Togo, Cote d'Ivoire and Burkina Faso.

Benin
- No cases of cVDPV2 case were reported in the past week. There is 1 cVDPV2 case reported in 2019 so far.
- No cVDPV2-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week.
- The risk of further cVDPV2 spread across West Africa remains high.

Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
- No cases of cVDPV2 have been reported the past week. There were 20 cVDPV2 cases reported in 2018. DRC is currently affected by 9 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks: 1 each originated in Haut Katanga, Mongala, Sankuru, Tanganika, Tshopo, Kasai, Kasai Central, and 2 in Haut Lomami provinces.

Angola
- 1 case of cVDPV2 has been reported this week in Amboim district, Kwanza Sul State. The onset of paralysis was on 12 Jul 2019. There is a total of 6 cVDPV2 cases from 3 outbreaks reported in 2019.

Central African Republic (CAR)
- There are 4 reported cases from 4 different outbreaks of cVDPV2 in 2019. Additional confirmed cVDPV2 community contacts have been reported in CAR.
- No environmental samples were reported.

- No case of cVDPV2 has been reported in the past week.
- Somalia has reported a total of 15 cVDPV cases (8 type 2, 6 type 3, and 1 coinfection of both type 2 and type 3) since the beginning of the outbreaks. cVDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in one environmental sample in Kenya collected on [21 Mar 2018]. There is also one reported case of cVDPV2 in Ethiopia, linked to Somalia, with onset on 20 May 2019.

Papua New Guinea
- No new cases of cVDPV1 were reported this week. There were 26 cases reported in 2018.

Mozambique
- No case of cVDPV2 outbreak has been reported this week. There was one case reported in 2018.

[The good news is that it is now 3 years since the last case of WPV-associated paralysis was confirmed in Nigeria, and in turn on the African Continent. The not so good news is that the WPV continues to circulate in Afghanistan (and Pakistan, although there were no newly confirmed cases reported by Pakistan in the past week).

Other not so good news is that cVDPV continues to be a problem in Africa and elsewhere in the world. Angola has confirmed one new cVDPV2-associated paralysis, and Ghana has confirmed one case of cVDPV2-associated disease.

As done in previous posts, to visualize all of this activity, I am putting links to HealthMap/ProMED-mail maps of countries with poliovirus activity during the past 12 months below. The size of the list remains impressive now with 19 countries -- 12 in Africa, 5 in Asia, and 2 in the Western Pacific.

[2] Myanmar cVDPV1 - WHO
Date: Thu 22 Aug 2019

On [23 Jun 2019], a vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (VDPV1) was isolated from a 2 year old child with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), with onset of paralysis on 22 May 2019, from Kayin state, Myanmar. Subsequently, on [11 Jul 2019], a genetically linked VDPV1 was isolated from the same state from a [5.5-year-old] child with AFP, with date of onset of paralysis on [14 Jun 2019], and it was classified as circulating VDPV1 (cVDPV1) on [12 Jul 2019]. On [25 Jul 2019], cVDPV1 was isolated from a 3rd AFP case from the same state, with date of onset of paralysis on 23 May 2019. Subsequently, on [19 Aug 2019], a 4th case of VDPV1 has been confirmed in a 6 year old child, with onset of paralysis on [23 Jul 2019]. The child has no history of vaccination with OPV. In addition, the virus has also been isolated from 7 healthy community contacts. These linked viruses have 25 to 31 nucleotide changes from Sabin 1. All cases and contacts are from Hpapun township of Kayin state, Myanmar.

Myanmar's routine immunization coverage is estimated at 91% for 3 doses of bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV) in 2018. Neighbouring countries, including Thailand and other countries in South East Asia, have been informed of the confirmed cVDPV1, and subnational surveillance is being strengthened across the region. In 2018, Myanmar and Kayin state met certification standards for AFP surveillance with non-polio AFP rate of 3.45, and stool adequacy rate of 100% for Kayin state.

In Myanmar, the last cVDPV1 outbreak was reported in 2007 with 4 cases. Also, in 2015, a cVDPV2 outbreak was reported in Rakhine state with 2 confirmed cases.

Public health response
----------------------
The Ministry of Health (MOH) and local health authorities are undertaking strong measures to stop the transmission of cVDPV1, and the partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) are providing support as required:
- A full epidemiological and virological field investigation has been conducted, including a thorough risk assessment;
- Active surveillance is being strengthened and subnational population immunity levels have been analyzed;
- 3 vaccination campaigns with bOPV have been conducted in 12 townships targeting about 300 000 children under the age of 5 years;
- 2 large-scale bOPV vaccination campaigns are being planned for August and October 2019 to cover 98 high-risk townships across the country, targeting 1.2 million children under the age of 5 years;
- Other regions/states have been alerted to improve immunization and AFP surveillance.

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
The detection of cVDPVs underscores the importance of maintaining high routine vaccination coverage everywhere to minimize the risk and consequences of any poliovirus circulation as well as the need to ensure quality surveillance for early detection of any polioviruses. These events also underscore the risk posed by any low-level transmission of the virus. A robust outbreak response is needed to rapidly stop circulation and ensure sufficient vaccination coverage in the affected areas to prevent similar outbreaks in the future.

For this event, the overall public health risk at [the] national level is considered to be high due to:
- low socioeconomic conditions and limited public health infrastructure in some parts of Kayin state.
- accumulated susceptible population due to low population immunity among specific Kayin state population, which poses a risk of ongoing transmission within and across the state.
- hard-to-reach area with accessibility challenges due to security concerns and geographical location, which hamper the vaccination and the implementation of response actions.
- the low routine immunization coverage in the affected areas provides favourable conditions for the expansion of a possible polio virus outbreak across different areas in the country.
- the high number of nucleotide changes of the cVDPV1 isolates, the recent discovery of new cases and the evidence of healthy contacts being infected indicate that the virus may have been circulating for a long time, thus increasing the risk of spread.
- although Kayin state met certification standard of AFP surveillance (2017-2018), there might be pockets of ongoing transmission which are not timely detected.
- the limited accessibility for healthcare providers in certain areas in Kayin state, including the affected Hpapun township, impedes the implementation of response measures.

As per UNHCR, as of June 2019, 95 681 refugees from Myanmar, most of them belonging to ethnic minorities from Kayin state, are living in 9 refugee camps in Thailand. The polio immunization coverage of Thailand is high, and a joint field visit conducted by WHO Country Office and MOH-Thailand following notification of cVDPV in Myanmar confirms that the coverage of OPV is 93.3% in these camps in 2018.

WHO will continue to evaluate the epidemiological situation and outbreak response measures being implemented.

WHO advice
----------
It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen polio surveillance in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.

WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel.

As per the advice of an Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), efforts to limit the international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country infected by poliovirus should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency and consider vaccination of all international travellers.

[The above report gives confirmation of a 4th case of cVDPV1-associated paralytic disease in Myanmar this year (2019), raising the total number of cVDPV cases reported in 2019 to 54. This is an excellent example of a country with high overall vaccination coverages, but large enough pockets of susceptibles to permit circulation of a VDPV.

Kayin State is located in the southeast of the country bordering with Thailand to its east (see https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/myanmar_map2.htm for a map of Myanmar showing administrative divisions). - Mod.MPP]
