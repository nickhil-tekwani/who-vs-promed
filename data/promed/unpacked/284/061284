With incidence of diseases found in patches of turmeric fields in [several] districts, farmers have been advised to take preventive measures to control the disease during the tuber formation stage.

[Local] scientists said that turmeric is an important commercial spice crop in the region. But heavy wind and the winter season can damage leaves and affect rhizome development.

Turmeric rhizome rot is a major disease with a yield reduction of 40 to 60 per cent. The soil should be treated with _Trichoderma_ biofungicide, while seed rhizomes should be treated with copper oxy chloride. For leaf spot and blotch diseases, foliar spraying should be done.

[Turmeric (_Curcuma longa_) is a valuable spice and medicinal herb belonging to the family Zingiberaceae, which also includes ginger and cardamom. These crops have similar cultural requirements and also share many of their root and leaf pathogens.

Fungal rhizome (soft) rots of ginger (and related crops) due to several pathogens (including _Fusarium_ and _Pythium_ species) have been reported from various locations. They are serious diseases which may lead to total crop losses. In India and the surrounding region, _Pythium_ species are most commonly reported as the cause.

Symptoms generally include yellowing and wilting of leaves, rotting of leaf bases and rhizomes and eventually death of the plants. The pathogens are mostly soil borne and also spread with infected plant material (including seed rhizomes), water and by mechanical means. Rhizome rots are favoured by humid conditions and high soil moisture. Disease management may include the use of well-drained planting sites, crop rotation, preventative chemical treatments (including copper compounds, as mentioned above) of rhizomes for planting and use of certified disease free planting material. However, in affected areas, even plants derived from disease-free rhizomes have a very high risk of being infected from local pathogen reservoirs.

Bacterial rhizome rots (_Ralstonia_ and _Erwinia_ species) are also known to affect the crops with similar symptoms, and occasionally nematodes have also been reported to be associated with such diseases.

Leaf spot of gingers may be due to the fungus _Phyllosticta zingiberis_. Symptoms include water soaked leaf spots, which develop dark brown margins and later coalesce to form necrotic areas. The pathogen is spread mainly by rain splash and consequently disease incidence is often severe under exposed conditions. Disease management usually relies on fungicide applications, but spraying may need to be repeated following wet periods.

Leaf blotch diseases may be due to the fungi _Phaeodactylum venkatesanum_ or _Glomerella cingulata_. Irregular lesions turning necrotic are observed mainly on mature leaves.

Antagonistic fungi in the genus _Trichoderma_ have been shown to be effective as biocontrol organisms to suppress various fungal pathogens including soil-inhabiting species. They are used as foliar applications as well as seed and soil treatments.
