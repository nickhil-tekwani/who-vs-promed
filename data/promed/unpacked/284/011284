Recent findings of a low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) H5 subtype in
domestic ducks in British Columbia, Canada (and subsequent quarantine and
culling of domestic ducks), as well as LPAI H5 strains (H5N2 and H5N9) in wild
mallard ducks in British Columbia, emphasize the importance of complementary
surveillance in both wild and domestic birds (Avian influenza, H5, poultry -
Canada (BC) 20051120.3370, Avian influenza - Canada (04): BC, MB
20051121.3379).
These findings raise interesting questions about the source of the viral
strains involved in the "outbreak" in domestic ducks, and the respective roles
of wild and domestic ducks in the ecology of avian influenza viruses.
Domestic ducks can act as asymptomatic carriers for both LPAI and HPAI (high-
pathogenicity avian influenza), shedding virus in feces and respiratory tract
secretions. Effects of HPAI in domestic ducks include a continuum ranging
from subtle production effects (with moderately increased mortality rates and
respiratory signs), to severe and even fatal disease (Alexander, 2000,
Veterinary Microbiology 74:3-13; Sturm-Ramirez et al., 2005, Journal of
Virology 79: 11269-11279; Kwon et al., 2005, Avian pathology, 34:367-370).
Manifestation of disease associated with HPAI in ducks depends on many
factors, including virus strain and host and environmental factors -- with
HPAI H5N1 "Asian strain" avian influenza proving exceptional in its ability to
cause disease in both wild and domestic waterfowl. If domestic ducks can act
as carriers, might they also act as a reservoir (i.e., by harboring and
shedding different subtypes of avian influenza), a role currently assumed to
be filled by wild waterfowl?
If so, speculation that wild birds are the source of LPAI in the "outbreak" in
domestic ducks in British Columbia should be curbed. Certainly, at a minimum,
we should await genetic characterization and epidemiological investigation,
including the degree of homology between the H5 sequence in domestic and wild
ducks in BC (the latter serendipitously available from the recent Canadian
wild bird survey). Such evidence would still only be circumstantial unless
spatial and temporal overlap between the domestic ducks and wild birds can be
demonstrated. Even then, the direction of flow is still open to
interpretation -- there can be spillover both ways (as occurred with H5N1 in
Asia, which probably mutated to a highly pathogenic form in poultry and moved
back into wild birds, with disastrous consequences).
More knowledge of the ecology and epidemiology of avian influenza viruses in
wild and domestic birds is necessary to truly assess the risk posed for
domestic birds from wild birds, and conversely, the risk that domestic birds
pose for wild bird populations. Increased surveillance, international
cooperation, expanded genetic databases, and recognition of genetic diversity
of avian influenza viruses are helpful. Unsupported speculation about the
origin of outbreaks is unhelpful and can only result in knee-jerk reactions by
domestic poultry producers and wild bird conservationists alike.

of the relationships between avian influenza strains and wild and domestic
ducks. - Mod.TG]
[A number of ProMED readers have emphasized the lack of pertinent data, in the
absence of which no conclusions can be drawn on the relative roles of wild
versus domestic avians in transmission. - Mod.JW]
