Epidemic Alert: Major threat to wheat and barley
------------------------------------------------
The University of Idaho [UoI] issued a sobering report concerning a severe virus infection impacting wheat and barley crops in southern Idaho. In fact, UoI's Juliet Marshall said the barley yellow dwarf virus [disease], which she characterized as a "major disease" was "rampant [in south-western Idaho]."

Marshall said the first symptoms of the viral disease began showing up in fields in early March [2015], triggering a formal warning to farmers. She added that many areas she visited in southern Idaho showed 85 to 95 per cent of viral infection.

As a result, some wheat growers are facing a worst-case scenario. Marshall said, Idaho growers are "facing very tough agronomic and financial decisions."

[Barley yellow dwarf (BYD) disease occurs worldwide and is the most destructive of virus diseases of wheat. Grain yields may be reduced by one third. It attacks a wide range of grass species (_Gramineae_) including cereal crops like barley, wheat, oats, rice, maize and rye. Symptoms include leaf discolouration from yellow to purple (depending on the host species), stunting, reduced tillering and empty seed heads. Plants infected in autumn may not survive the winter or show severe symptoms when growth resumes. Diseased plants often occur in circular patches within the field, which are associated with colonisation by the aphid vectors.

BYD viruses have now been split into several species in the family _Luteoviridae_ (mostly in the genus _Luteovirus_). They are differentiated by their ability to be transmitted by various aphid species and their virulence on a selected variety of oats. Some of the viruses are transmitted equally well by several aphids, whereas others can be transmitted by only one or 2 species. The viruses cannot be transmitted by seed, pollen, or mechanical means and cannot survive in stubble or in the soil. Volunteer cereal plants or grassy weeds may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management includes use of resistant cultivars and control of the aphid vectors.
