Anthrax is fast spreading in different villages of Tumudibandh block
in Kandhamal district [Orissa state]. The outbreak was first reported
in Sanaguchuka village in Gumma panchayat and 10 days later, it has
spread to 10 more villages under Bilamala and Belaghar panchayats.

The swab and blood tests of 4 persons from the affected villages were
found positive on Monday [13 Jun 2011]. Even the blood samples and
swabs sent for tests last week were found positive. The disease has so
far affected 25 persons.

Meanwhile, health camps have been opened in Badaguchuka and
Sanaguchuka. The health officials [reported] that steps have been
initiated to disinfect water bodies in the affected areas and the
inhabitants have been asked not to consume dry meat.

The condition of the affected persons who were admitted to MKCG
Medical College and Hospital is stated to be stable.

[If they are disinfecting 'water bodies' the authorities must have
been pulling carcasses out of the said water bodies. Dried meat can be
a significant risk because by drying the meat from infected animals
the vegetative cells are given this opportunity to sporulate. And as
this dry meat (jerky for Americans) gets stored and sold in street
markets near and far vastly increasing the public health risks. -
