Hundreds of people in eastern China have been infected with bacteria that can cause dysentery after drinking contaminated water, state media said Monday [24 Aug 2020], prompting the closure of a local water plant. Nearly 500 people in the rural town of Baoyi -- about 550 km (342 mi) west of Shanghai -- have developed fever and diarrhoea since late last week.

A report by the local government published Sunday [23 Aug 2020] found they have been infected with the shigella bacterium, a genus of microbes that can cause dysentery. The town's water supply has been shut down, and nearly 300 people have been hospitalized, county officials said.

Video footage posted on social media by the state-run People's Daily on Monday [24 Aug 2020] showed patients sitting in rows of beds in a local hospital. Many of the patients were elderly or children, according to the newspaper.

Fears over the safety of drinking water remain a problem for much of China, including its wealthiest cities, where many residents rely on bottled or boiled water. China's Ministry of Water Resources had improved water supply services for 256 million rural residents across the country by the end of July [2020], the official Xinhua news agency said Friday [21 Aug 2020].

[Shigella was discovered more than 100 years ago by the Japanese microbiologist Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named. There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. Shigella organisms can survive transit through the stomach because they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10-100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given the relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread, including sexual practices more common in MSM (men who have sex with men). Humans are the only natural reservoir for the disease.

The bacterium is the classical cause of bacterial dysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux), an inflammatory disorder of the colon that results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing the diarrhea). - Mod.LL
