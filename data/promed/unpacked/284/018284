[With the continuing decline of the number of cases in the human
population of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- abbreviated
previously as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail -- it has been
decided to broaden the scope of the occasional ProMED-mail updates to
include other prion-related diseases. In addition to vCJD, data on
other forms of CJD: sporadic, iatrogenic, familial, and GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease) are also included since they
may have some relevance to the incidence and etiology of vCJD. -

The number of deaths due to definite or probable vCJD as of 4 Apr
2011 remains 171. A total of 4 definite/probable patients remain alive
so the total number of definite or probable vCJD cases remains 175.

The overall picture remains consistent with the view that the vCJD
outbreak in the UK is in decline, albeit now with a pronounced tail.
The first cases were observed in 1995, and the peak number of deaths
was 28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in
2003, 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in 2007, 1 in 2008, 3 in
2009, 3 in 2010, and 1 so far in 2011.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the UK in the year 2011
------------------------------------------------------------
During 2011 so far [as of 4 Apr 2011], there have been 39 referrals,
14 fatal cases of sporadic CJD, 1 case of GSS, 2 cases of familial
CJD, 1 case of vCJD, and none of iatrogenic CJD.

Since records began in 1990 there have been 2772 referrals, 1223
fatal cases of sporadic CJD, 171 cases of vCJD, 65 cases of iatrogenic
CJD, 84 cases of familial CJD, and 44 of GSS.

Cumulative data 1 Jan to 28 Feb 2011, the 12 months of 2010, and
overall since 1996
----------------------------------------------------------------------
During the 1st 2 months of 2011 there have been 52 referrals, 28 of
whom were classified as prion disease cases, comprising 10 cases of
sporadic CJD, 3 of familial CJD, and none of iatrogenic CJD or vCJD.

During the 12 months of 2010 there were 403 referrals, of whom 251
were classified as prion disease cases, comprising 208 cases of
sporadic CJD, 40 of familial CJD, and none of iatrogenic or vCJD.

Overall 3952 referrals have been examined since screening began in
1996 or thereabouts, with diagnoses pending in 13 cases or
inconclusive in 18 cases, a measure of the difficulty in achieving
unequivocal diagnoses.

During this 16 year period a total of 2329 prion disease cases have
been screened, a figure which includes 18 (15 during 2010) cases with
type determination pending, but in which a diagnosis of vCJD has been
excluded. Overall there were 1965 cases of sporadic CJD, 338 cases of
familial CJD an, 5 cases of iatrogenic CJD, and 3 cases of vCJD. The 3
cases of vCJD recorded in the USA have been attributed to infection
occurring in the United Kingdom in 2 cases, and in Saudi Arabia in the
other.

[4] Canada: 2nd vCJD case

Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [vCJD] in a Canadian resident
---------------------------------------------------------------
Canadian Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance System [CJDSS],
National Microbiology Laboratory, Public Health Agency of Canada.
Working closely with Canadian clinical specialists, the Public Health
Agency of Canada's Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance System
(CJDSS) has identified a probable case of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease (variant CJD, also called vCJD) in a Canadian resident. The
diagnosis is supported by several lines of clinical, paraclinical, and
laboratory evidence, in keeping with internationally accepted
surveillance case definitions for human prion disease.(1, 2)

This is the 2nd case of variant CJD reported in Canada to date. The
1st such case occurred in 2002, in an individual who is believed to
have contracted the disease outside of Canada (3). As explained in
more detail below, evidence to date strongly indicates that (i) the
risk [of] exposure in the 2nd case also occurred outside Canada; (ii)
there are no negative implications for the safety of the Canadian food
supply; and (iii) the case poses no secondary risks to the health of
Canadians.

Variant CJD belongs to a group of rare, fatal degenerative brain
disorders called prion diseases that affect humans and animals and can
arise sporadically, genetically, or through infectious transmission
(4). Prion diseases are marked by brain tissue vacuolation (spongiform
change), neuronal loss, and presence of a pathologically altered form
of a host-encoded glycoprotein, PrP, that is considered to constitute
the transmissible agent, or prion (5). Among classic types of human
prion disease, the most common and widespread is sporadic CJD, which
occurs without an apparent infectious or genetic cause mostly in
persons 50 years of age or older and accounts for 80-90 percent of the
remarkably uniform annual prion disease mortality of 1-2 per million
population (6). Most of the remaining 10-20 percent of classic human
prion diseases are caused by mutations in the PRNP gene that encodes
PrP (7). Fewer than 1 percent of classic cases of CJD are attributed
to accidental transmission through surgical and medical procedures
such as dura mater grafts, and use of therapeutic hormone preparations
that were derived from prion-contaminated cadaveric pituitary tissue
(8).

Variant CJD is the only known zoonotic human prion disease, resulting
from dietary exposure to a feed borne prion disease of cattle, bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, also known as "mad cow disease"), that
emerged internationally in the 1980s and 1990s (9). Most human
exposure to BSE is thought to have occurred before regulatory controls
were implemented to control BSE in animals and to eliminate the
inclusion of high-risk bovine tissues in human food (10), A small
number of secondary cases of variant CJD have also been linked to
transfusion of fresh blood components (erythrocytes) from
pre-symptomatic donors who later developed the disease (11). By
October 2010, a total of 222 [now 224] definite and probable variant
CJD cases had been reported worldwide in residents of 12 countries
(12). The total numbers of clinical cases of variant CJD that will
ultimately emerge remains uncertain, as does the frequency of
long-term asymptomatic carriage during which apparently healthy
individuals could transmit infection for example through blood
donation or invasive medical procedures (13).

Importantly, based on extensive interviews with family members there
is no indication that the current patient was ever a blood donor,
received a blood transfusion, or underwent a surgical procedure that
was not managed to prevent prion transmission as per the Public Health
Agency of Canada's CJD Infection Control Guidelines (14). This
indicates the absence of secondary risks to the health of Canadians as
a result of this case. Health Canada issued directives to Canadian
blood operators in 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2005, requiring deferral of
blood donors with a history of residence and/or travel in the United
Kingdom (UK), France, and Western Europe in the period 1980-1996, as
well as other criteria including receipt of blood transfusion in the
UK, and has committed to review these deferral policies if new
scientific information becomes available. Canada has also reported a
small number of cases of BSE (15), and Health Canada and the Canadian
Food Inspection Agency have implemented regulations to prevent both
the transmission of BSE in animal populations and human exposure to
it. Given (i) these protective measures, (ii) the observation that
acquired prion diseases have long incubation periods (years to often a
decade or more), and (iii) the fact that the current patient
experienced onset of symptoms just prior to immigrating to Canada in
early 2010, the possibility of BSE exposure in this country can
essentially be ruled out as the cause of illness. The patient was born
in the Middle East and also resided in several other countries before
arriving in Canada. Apart from a few visits totalling less than 3
months in duration, there was no history of travel to the UK or
Europe.

In Canada, all human prion diseases are both legally reportable at
the provincial/territorial level and nationally notifiable, and
despite their rarity the public health importance and economic impacts
of these diseases have maintained a need for timely diagnosis,
reporting, and surveillance. To help meet these requirements the CJDSS
has conducted prospective national surveillance of human prion
diseases continuously since 1998, and working collaboratively with a
network of health professionals sponsors detailed diagnostic and
epidemiologic investigation of any suspected case of human prion
disease in Canada. Supporting laboratory services are provided for
autopsy, neuropathologic examination, molecular genetics, and
biochemical testing for 14-3-3 protein in cerebrospinal fluid. Test
results are reported directly to referring health professionals, with
CJDSS case files maintained centrally to facilitate diagnostic
assessment and final case classification. Full patient enrolment with
the CJDSS takes place with written informed consent. The CJDSS
surveillance protocol has been approved by the Health Canada Research
Ethics Board [REB] (Certificate REB-2009-0036), and by numerous REBs
at collaborating healthcare institutions.

For further information on human prion diseases, available services
and how to access them, interested health professionals are invited to

[5] Canada: 2nd vCJD case
Date: Thu 24 Mar 2011
Source: Alberta Farmer Express [edited]
http://www.albertafarmexpress.ca/issues/story.aspx?aid=1000405685


The person believed to be Canada's 2nd-ever case of the type of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease transmitted by BSE-infected beef is seen as
unlikely to have picked it up in this country. In a recent report, the
Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) said the evidence in the latest
probable case of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) "strongly
indicates" the victim's risk exposure happened outside Canada. Thus
[far], PHAC said in its weekly communicable disease report, the
evidence suggests "no negative implications for the safety of the
Canadian food supply."

CJD is one of a group of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies
that includes BSE in cattle, scrapie in sheep, and chronic wasting
disease in deer and elk. Variant CJD is the only known zoonotic human
prion disease, usually caused by dietary exposure to the misfolded
proteins (prions) that cause BSE in cattle. While Canada has confirmed
18 domestic cases of BSE in cattle since 2003, regulations have long
been in place to prevent BSE transmission to people and to other
animals.

Health Canada now also requires deferral of blood donors with a
history of residence and/or travel in the UK, France, and Western
Europe between 1980 and 1996, as well as those who got transfusions in
the UK

With those measures in mind, plus the fact that the person in this
case showed onset of vCJD symptoms starting just before immigrating to
Canada early last year [2010], "the possibility of BSE exposure in
this country can essentially be ruled out as the cause of illness,"
PHAC said. The patient had no history of travel to the UK or Europe
apart from a few visits totalling less than 3 months in duration, PHAC
said. The victim was born in the Middle East and also lived in several
other countries before arriving in Canada, the agency added.
Furthermore, PHAC said, "based on extensive interviews with family
members there is no indication that the current patient was ever a
blood donor, received a blood transfusion, or underwent a surgical
procedure that was not managed to prevent prion transmission."

[6] Sporadic CJD: new biomarker
Date: Wed 9 Mar 2011
Source: Science Daily [edited]
http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/03/110309182700.htm


New biomarker for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease identified
------------------------------------------------------
Neena Singh, MD, PhD and colleagues at Case Western Reserve
University School of Medicine [Ohio, USA] have identified the 1st
disease-specific biomarker for sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(sCJD), a universally fatal, degenerative brain disease for which
there is no cure. sCJD is one of the causes of dementia and typically
leads to death within a year of disease onset. The finding, published
in the 9 Mar 2011 issue of PLoS ONE [reference below] provides a basis
for developing a test to diagnose sCJD while patients are still alive.
Presently, the only definitive diagnostic test for the disease
requires brain tissue be obtained by biopsy or after death.

In their study, Dr Singh, associate professor of pathology at the
School of Medicine, and her team found that levels of the
iron-transport protein transferrin (Tf) are significantly decreased in
the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with sCJD well before the
end stage of the disease, potentially allowing for earlier diagnosis.
"The decrease in Tf is significant enough to distinguish sCJD from
dementia of non-CJD origin with an accuracy of 80 percent," Dr Singh
says. "When combined with the currently used non-disease-specific
biomarker T-tau, the diagnostic accuracy increases to 86 percent. This
suggests that the 2 biomarkers represent separate disease processes,
and complement each other as diagnostic biomarkers."

A decrease in the levels of CSF Tf reflects the imbalance of brain's
iron metabolism that is associated with sCJD. Being a part of the sCJD
disease process, CSF Tf is likely to be a more precise indicator of
sCJD than the current tests, Dr Singh explains. "CSF Tf is 1st first
biomarker that is related to the underlying pathology in sCJD brains,"
Dr Singh explains.

Presently, sCJD is diagnosed by testing for elevated levels of the
proteins 14-3-3 and T-tau in the CSF of cases suspected of the
disease. Since these biomarkers are elevated in several other diseases
besides sCJD, the incidence of false positive results is high.
Replacement of 14-3-3 with Tf increases the specificity of the test
significantly, providing a superior biomarker combination for the
diagnosis of sCJD. The ability to accurately diagnose patients while
they are still living is critical to prevent inadvertent spread of
sCJD to healthy individuals, to reduce the misdiagnosis of potentially
treatable causes of dementia, and to eventually develop potential
therapies for sCJD, according to Dr Singh.

As a part of their study, Dr Singh and her team estimated levels of
Tf in the CSF collected up to 24 months before death from confirmed
cases of sCJD (n=99) and dementia of non-CJD origin (n=74). They found
that levels of Tf were decreased significantly in sCJD cases compared
to dementia of non-CJD origin. Further testing revealed that
measurement of CSF Tf alone identified sCJD with a sensitivity of 85
percent, specificity of 72 percent, and accuracy of 80 percent. When
combined with the surrogate biomarker T-tau, the CSF Tf and T-tau
combination identified sCJD with an improved specificity of 87 percent
and accuracy of 86 percent according to the research.

In addition to providing improved diagnostic accuracy, Dr Singh notes
that CSF Tf has several other advantages. It is resistant to
degradation by enzymes, ensuring consistent results even in poorly
preserved CSF samples; Tf-beta2, the brain specific isoform of Tf is
equally efficient in identifying sCJD and is likely to provide
accurate results even from samples that are accidentally contaminated
with blood during the collection process; and, Tf is abundant in the
CSF relative to the currently used biomarkers 14-3-3 and T-tau,
allowing accurate diagnosis from a small sample volume.

Moving forward, researchers will work to establish a user-friendly,
quantitative test for CSF Tf to provide a quick and uniform method of
diagnosis for sCJD. They will also continue testing CSF samples from
sCJD and other forms of human and animal prion disorders to establish
the earliest time point in the disease course when this test becomes
positive.

http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0016804.

The need for a biomarker is self-evident, but it is problematic
whether the procedure described above would be sufficiently flexible
to forestall the incidents described in the following reports. -

[7] UK: CJD surgery alert
Date: Tue 29 Mar 2011
Source: NewsWales [edited]
http://www.newswales.co.uk/?section=Health&F=1&id=21022


Public Health Wales has contacted 38 patients who may have been put
at risk of contracting Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) during surgery.
CJD, an incurable brain disease, is commonly known as a human form of
mad cow disease because bovine spongiform encephalopathy is the cause
of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans.

Letters were sent to those at risk after it became apparent that a
patient who underwent surgery in a hospital in the Abertawe Bro
Morgannwg Health Board area in 2007 was at high risk of the disease.
All surgical instruments used on the patient were removed from use
when the patient's history became known, and all patients operated on
with the same instruments in the interim have now been informed.

Public Health Wales says that the risk of transmission of CJD from
one patient to another via surgical instruments is extremely low.
There have only ever been 6 cases worldwide of any form of CJD being
transmitted in this way.

Dr Hoffmann, consultant in Communicable Disease Control for Public
Health Wales, said: "In this incident, we do not have a single
confirmed case of CJD. However, we do have one patient who was at high
risk and 38 people at extremely low risk.

"We know that all the surgical instruments used on this group of
patients were cleaned, disinfected, and sterilised normally. However,
it is possible that the proteins that cause CJD, known as prions,
survived these routine sterilisation procedures so an extremely small
risk of transmission remains.

"We have identified and written to all patients concerned to make
them aware of the extremely low risk. They have been offered
information and support and a helpline has been set up for anyone who
has received a letter and has further questions. "All patients at risk
have been contacted and there is no risk to anybody else. People who
have had any type of surgery in the Abertawe Bo Morgannwg Health Board
area since 2007 but who have not been contacted by us have no reason
at all to worry."

CJD is a rare disease that affects the structures of the brain and
causes incurable neurological symptoms. There is currently no
treatment or cure for CJD. Anyone who is aware they are at increased
risk of CJD should not donate blood or organs and should always inform
their surgeon or other health care professional before undergoing any
health procedure.

[8] UK: CJD surgery alert
Date: Tue 29 Mar 2011
Source: BBC News, Health [summ., edited]
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-12898082


Two separate incidents have emerged in which patients have been told
they were put at risk of contracting Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD).
In both cases the fatal brain-wasting disease could have been picked
up during surgery.

At Queen's Hospital in Romford in Essex, 21 brain surgery patients
have received letters. A further 38 patients in Wales were told on
Saturday [26 Mar 2011] they had been put at risk.

In both situations, the hospitals say they followed normal practices
to clean, disinfect, and sterilise the surgical instruments involved.
One of the UK's leading experts on prion diseases, Professor John
Collinge, said such incidents are not uncommon. He said the risk to
patients from contaminated surgical instruments was believed to be
small but is not yet quantified. He thought more could be done to stop
this happening at all. His team has developed an effective prion
deactivation soak, a bit like a biological washing powder, and even
has a commercial partner, but the substance is not being used in
hospitals.

CJD is one of a group of so-called prion diseases. Unlike viruses and
bacteria, prions are extremely hardy, and cannot be destroyed by
normal decontamination methods, such as autoclaving of surgical
instruments. [BBC] News Night has discovered that in the aftermath of
the BSE, or "mad cow", incident in the UK, several research teams
produced prion deactivation techniques. The human form of BSE, or
variant CJD, is another of these prion diseases. The research groups
had even teamed up with commercial companies, keen to develop these
decontamination products. Professor Collinge's team worked with
Dupont. Another was a spin out from Edinburgh University, and a 3rd
emerged from the government-sponsored Health Protection Agency (HPA).
But all 3 products seem to have quietly disappeared before they could
be proved in a hospital setting. Edinburgh University told BBC News
Night: "It is believed that end users would only be prepared to adopt
(our method) if legally required to do so." The HPA said there was "no
incentive for hospitals to use it. We did the research and
development, but we don't set the policy".

Professor Collinge added that: "The Department of Health (DoH)
doesn't now give central diktats to NHS [National Health Service]
Trusts... it is frustrating things don't seem to be joined up. We
spend a lot of money on ensuring bloods are safe as possible in this
country [the UK] but we seem to be doing relatively little with
surgical instruments, and that doesn't seem entirely logical."

The DoH said technologies to improve hospital infection control go to
its Rapid Review Panel (RRP). The product from Professor Collinge's
group was deemed to have potential, but he was told that more work was
needed in a clinical setting. The company was given advice on how to
improve the application in September 2010 and it's now up to the
manufacturer to decide whether to take it further. Dupont says it made
a business decision to withdraw its prion deactivator some time ago,
and doesn't want to comment further.
