-------------------------------------------------------
The concern over whether coyote urine is the source of canine distemper in the current outbreak of desert kit foxes is likely to be overstated.

As was noted in a posting, materials such as coyote urine are registered with the EPA. A requirement of the registration process is that the manufacturer provides data that show that the process of producing the final product is capable of significantly reducing the pathogen load that might be contained in the raw material. Frequently, the virus used to assess this process is canine parvovirus. For those actually aware of stability of viruses in the environment, their choice would be this agent. A 5-6 log reduction in canine parvovirus in the manufacturing process would almost certainly eliminate canine distemper virus. I would suggest focusing the effort to identify the source of canine distemper virus in this instance on a more plausible culprit.

Some points to consider in this ongoing discussion. According to Craig Greene in "Infectious Diseases of the Dog and Cat":
"CDV is susceptible to UV light, although protein or antioxidants help to protect it from inactivation. Extremely susceptible to heat and drying, CDV is destroyed by temperatures greater than 50 to 60 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes. In removed tissues it survives for at least an hour at 37 degrees C and for 3 hours at (room temperature) 27 degrees C. In warm climates, CDV does not persist in kennels after infected dogs have been removed. Storage and survival times of CDV are longer at colder temperatures. At near-freezing (0-4 degrees C), it survives in the environment for weeks."

It seems unlikely that commercially prepared coyote urine products could be implicated in the transmission of this virus into the desert kit fox population. Once introduced, canine distemper virus transmits easily within any young, naive and unvaccinated population. I would look closely at the companion animals which may have been brought into the construction sites of this solar project.
