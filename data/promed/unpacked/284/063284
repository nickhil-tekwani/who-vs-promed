[In 2006, 54 outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza were reported by the Palestinian Authority. The outbreaks were located in the Gaza Strip (10 outbreaks) and in the West Bank (44 outbreaks). In addition, there was one outbreak reported in 2011 in the West Bank.

H5N1 was the subtype identified in those outbreaks reported in the Gaza Strip in 2006 and for the one outbreak in the West Bank in 2011. The subtype reported for the remainder of the outbreaks was noted as "other." The term "other" is somewhat confusing, because it is not clear as to what subtype it refers.

For more details, see WAHID's OIE database, section "Detailed country(ies) disease incidence" at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail (note: to view the information on HPAI in the Palestinian Auton. Territories, choose the country, scroll down to the name of the disease (terrestrial), and choose time period) and their annual report 2006, section 3, at http://tinyurl.com/maoavhk.

Between 2007 and 2010 the disease was reported as absent.

There is a good probability that the current subtype in Siris, West Bank is similar to the recent one reported in Aviel, Israel on Sat 17 Jan 2015, namely H5N1 (ProMED-mail post 20150119.3102962). The distance between Siris (PAT) and Aviel (Israel) is only about 40 km.
