Some boys were kicking and throwing rocks at a Mexican free-tailed
bat, when a 6-year-old girl stepped in to save it. The bat sunk its
fangs into her, and later that day, 18 Oct 2010, she went to Driscoll
Children's Hospital where she got the 1st in a series of rabies shots
as a precaution, her father said. A few days later the state confirmed
that the bat was rabid.

Now, several others also are getting shots, and health authorities are
taking precautions to prevent an outbreak of the disease that almost
always is fatal.

Authorities also want to question a family down the block from the
girl's family, who found a bat in their garage and may have handled
it. And an odd-acting stray cat that was found wandering in the
neighborhood Sunday [24 Oct 2010] has been sent to Austin for analysis
because it also may be infected, San Patricio County Health Authority
James Mobley said.

The girl's 17-year-old sister, a male (20), an 18-year-old woman, a
59-year-old man and a boy (12) all handled the bat and started rabies
shots Saturday [23 Oct 2010] as a precaution, Mobley said.

Vaccination decisions are based on the situation and amount of
exposure. Treatment, which prevents the disease's onset, includes one
dose of immune globulin and 4 doses of rabies vaccine over a 14-day
period.

"They don't hurt much when you get them," said Jones, who took one in
the arm and one in each leg. "The ones in the legs still hurt. I'm
just glad they don't do it in the belly anymore. I was freaked about
that."

Rabies is spread when an infected animal's saliva is passed to one who
is uninfected, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. The most common transmission is through a bite, though
there are documented cases of airborne spread and contamination of
mucous membranes such as eyes, nose or mouth, according to the Centers
for Disease Control.

Once symptoms start, the disease is almost 100 percent fatal, Mobley said.

Since 1990, there have been 8 cases of rabies in Texans, one in 2009,
according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. All died.

Jones said seeing the bat on the ground was no surprise for those in
the neighborhood, because lots of them fly out of an opening in the
shingles of an apartment 4-plex down the street every evening at dark.

Colonies of Mexican free-tailed bats can number more than 1000 in a
space the size of an attic, said Kevin Koski, a bat specialist with
United Bat Control, a nationwide commercial and residential bat
removal service. One in 5 bats has rabies, Mobley said.

Portland Police Chief Randy Wright said the city has been in contact
with the owner of the 4-plex. State authorities have recommended the
hiring of a firm that specializes in bats, because handling them in
the wrong way can cause more problems than it solves, Wright said.
Bats, which are federally protected, should not be killed; they should
be evicted.

[Bats are common, but the notion of a 20 percent prevalence mentioned
in this article is far from being universally accepted. There is a
substantial difference between prevalence in normal bat populations
and prevalence in bats submitted to the laboratory, because most bats
submitted for laboratory diagnosis exhibit some kind of abnormal
behavior. Abnormal behavior is an indicator of possible rabies cases,
and, therefore, laboratory sample populations will be biased towards a
higher prevalence estimate. Thus, the population of laboratory
submitted bats is likely to be a high prevalence subpopulation of all
bats in an area. The very sound folks at Southeastern Cooperative
Wildlife Disease Study, one of the foremost authorities on wildlife
disease, looked into the matter in one of their briefs (SCWDS Briefs,
Rabies in Bats, July 1998, 14.2
<http://www.uga.edu/scwds/topic_index/1998/RabiesinBats.pdf>) from
which the following is excerpted:

Every state except Hawaii has reported rabies in bats, with the
highest numbers of cases reported from California and Texas. Although
bats are not the most common wildlife species diagnosed with rabies
(positive bats range from 8 to 27 percent of rabies-positive wildlife
cases per year), almost all recent human rabies deaths from exposures
acquired in the United States have been traced to bats. This fact was
determined by genetic analyses of rabies viruses recovered from
humans. These tests can distinguish bat rabies virus from other virus
strains such as raccoon, skunk, coyote/dog, etc.

Since 1981, 24 people have died from rabies infections acquired in the
United States, and 21 were due to strains of rabies virus associated
with bats. In addition, case studies revealed that bat bites may go
unnoticed or are disregarded as "insect bites." Only one of the 21
human bat rabies cases had a documented bat bite, while another 10
involved some retrospective account of contact with bats. Thus, it
appears that only 52 percent of the victims had any known exposure to
bats. Because bat bites and virus transmission may go unrecognized by
victims, public health authorities have changed their recommendations
regarding post-exposure vaccination of people. It is now recommended
that vaccine treatment should be considered under many circumstances
where there is no demonstrable bite or scratch, e.g., a sleeping
person awakens to find a bat in the room, or an adult finds a bat in a
room with a child or incapacitated person. Treatment is indicated if
the bat cannot be tested. Ran!
domly sampled, normal bats have a rabies prevalence of less than one
percent. Because many bats submitted for rabies testing are displaying
abnormal behavior, higher prevalence rates are found by diagnostic
laboratories that test bats found by the public. For example, in
recent years, approximately 11 percent of bats submitted in the
southeastern United States were positive for rabies. - Mod.PC]
