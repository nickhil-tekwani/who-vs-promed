A reporter for the independent news agency reported in Cuba dozens of new cases of cholera in Havana while authorities of the island made urgent appeals to the population to prevent further increased number of patients. Information was provided by Mario Echevarria, Let's Talk Press, based in Havana. Echevarria said that Public Health Ministry officials have declared a "state of alert" in certain areas of Old Havana. The order was established recently after house to house inspection, he said.

"A doctor, who preferred to remain anonymous said that they have 47 cases detected in the town Habana Vieja, 17 are natural capital and 33 come from the eastern provinces," said the journalist. He also said that the authorities have activated emergency stations. In August 2012, the Cuban government said the cholera crisis was over after 3 deaths and 417 confirmed cases.

Since late June 2012, a month after the Ministry of Public Health Cuba recognized the emergence of a cholera outbreak in the east of the island and said that the health crisis was "controlled," the figures on the disease have increased consistently. The authorities have banned the use of wells. Physicians visit communities and homes to verify compliance with the measures. Local radio stations advised people to boil water, cook food thoroughly and wash their hands.

The origin of the cholera crisis in the island has not been clarified. A hypotheses about the health emergency does not rule it was caused by an infection from the group of volunteers, doctors and assistants who have provided humanitarian services in Haiti. The deteriorating health situation appears to be exacerbating the spread of cholera in the town.

An announcement on 2 Nov 2012, the Pan American Health Organization, part of the World Health Organization, said that suspected cholera cases detected in several areas of the country continue to be investigated. The region most affected by cholera has been the east. In November 2012, the Hurricane Sandy landfall between Manzanillo and Santiago de Cuba, the 2nd largest city and capital of the island province of the same name.

[The report says that of the 47 cholera infections alleged to have occurred in Old Havana (Havana Viejo), 33 were in individuals from the 5 eastern provinces that have been reported to continue to have cases but 17 cases have been reported to have been acquired in the Cuban capital. 33 plus 17 make 50, so the numbers do not add up. Clarification would be appreciated. - Mod.LL
