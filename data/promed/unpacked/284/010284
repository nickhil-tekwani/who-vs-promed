Preliminary tests by the Health Ministry point to food poisoning in
the mysterious deaths of 10 people in Magelang regency, Central Java,
an official said Tue 31 Jul 2007.
"Before becoming ill, the victims ate tempe gembus (fermented soybean
pulp) that was contaminated with the toxin producing _Pseudomonas
cocovenenans_ bacterium [now _Burkholderia cocovenenans_ or _B.
gladioli_ pathovar _cocovenenans_ - Mod.LL]," Health Minister Siti
Fadilah Supari said.
"Even though we have yet to come to a final conclusion, that (food
poisoning) is the most likely cause so far. We're also focusing our
examination on contamination by arsenic, cyanide and heavy metals."
The ministry's director general of disease control and environmental
health, Nyoman Kandun, said his office would announce its final
conclusions within the next 2 weeks. "Tests for bacteria will take 2
to 4 days, and tests for metallic substances between 10 days to 2
weeks," he said.
There have in the past been reported deaths in Central Java caused by
the consumption of food contaminated with _Pseudomonas cocovenenans_.
Most of these incidents were the result of people eating tempe
bongkrek (soybean cake made with coconut pulp). The bacterium
produces a lethal toxic substance that damages human cells.
On 23 and 24 Jul 2007, 10 residents of Beran hamlet in Kanigoro
village, Ngablak district in Magelang died after complaining of
similar symptoms, stomach pain, nausea and headaches. "The deaths
were attributed to acute multi-organ failure, which is the most
severe stage of cell damage," Kandun said.
A total of 20 others with similar symptoms are being treated at Tidar
Hospital, Muntilan Hospital and Grabag community health center in
Magelang, and at Kariadi Hospital in Semarang. Kandun said the deaths
were not caused by acute fulminant hepatitis (liver failure) as
originally suspected.
A joint health team from the police, the Central Java Health Agency
and the provincial police's forensic laboratory, including
microbiology and toxicology experts, has been deployed to the area to
take environmental and biological samples.
"Our team has found _Pseudomonas cocovenenans_ in food samples and in
the victims' vomit, but we still have to cross-check the results with
other laboratories," Kandun said.
The team also took air and water samples in Beran hamlet, as well as
examining the local sanitation system, and found no contamination by
toxic substances.

[The name _Pseudomonas cocovenenans_ was proposed for an organism
associated with food poisoning in 1960 (1). In 1982 and 1988 (2),
strains of this organism were isolated in China from sour fermented
corn flour and from mildew-affected fungi. Toxic products from the
bacterium were found to be associated with illness, not the organism itself.
In 1995 (3), the name was changed based on phylogenetic evidence to
_Burkholderia cocovenenans_ and more more recently B. gladioli (4)
and even more recently (5) it has been suggested that the organism
should be classified as _B. gladioli_ but as _B. gladioli_ pathovar
_cocovenenans_ to distinguish it from B. _gladioli_ pathovar
_gladioli_ which does not produce toxins but can cuase human
infections especially in those with cystic fibrosis (6), chronic
granulomatous disease (7) and naturally occurring anti-interferon
antibody-gamma antibody (8).
_B. gladioli_ (formerly _Pseudomonas gladioli_ or _P. marginata_)
was initially described in 1921 as a phytopathogen of gladioli and
other flowers (9). Whether the isolates that cause plant disease and
those that produce human disease are identical is not clear.
_B. cocovenenans_ produces 2 toxins: bongkrekic acid, a mitochondrial
poison which inhibits adenine nucloetide translocase (10), a
component of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore complex
and toxoflavin, which is impairs electron transfer in the
mitochondrial respiratory chain.
A discussion regarding the circumstances of this foodborne illness
(derived from <http://www.biotechlab.com.au/fd1oct99.htm>) follows:
"In many countries, fermented vegetable matter, as an alternative to
fresh meat, forms an important source of protein. One such product is
the many varieties of tempe, produced in Indonesia. Tempe is prepared
principally from soybeans or other legumes. Soybean tempe (tempe
kedele) is a high protein food with significant nutritional
properties and a good public health record.
"In the Regency of Banyumas and surrounding areas of Central Java,
Indonesia, tempe bongkrek and other coconut based products are
prepared from partly defatted coconut. The raw material for tempe
bongkrek sometimes is mixed with the residue from the manufacture of
tofu (soybean curd) and allowed to ferment with the mold _Rhizopus
oligosporus_. The final product is a compact cake in which the white
mold covers and penetrates the substrate and binds the particles together.
"Tempe is consumed as cubes or slices, especially after deep frying.
Under certain conditions, the contaminating bacterium, _Burkholderia
cocovenenans_ may grow in tempe bongkrek, producing 2 toxins:
colourless bongkrek acid and yellow-colored toxoflavin. Bongkrek food
poisoning usually has a latency period of 4 to 6 hours. Typical
symptoms are malaise, abdominal pains, dizziness, extensive sweating,
marked tiredness and sleepiness after which the patient passes into a
coma. Death occurs from 1 to 20 hours after the onset of the initial symptoms.
"Laboratory techniques for the detection of Burkholderia cocovenenans
in foods have been established, but as yet have not been
standardized. An efficient and specific enrichment procedure is
required to examine food and environmental samples for the presence
of the bacteria."

[As this outbreak is related to a known plant disease producing
organism, we've asked our plant disease moderator for additional
comments - Mod.MPP
_B. gladioli_ (previously _Pseudomonas marginata_) is a soil
bacterium that causes scab on gladiolus. It can also affect other
ornamental bulbs, for example freesias. Symptoms on gladiulus are
brown leaf spots and brown, round, sunken areas with raised edges on
corms. Spots are covered with sticky bacterial ooze. A soft rot of
the neck develops. The pathogen is spread in soil and water, by
mechanical means (including on insects) and with infected plant
material. Disease management includes the use of clean planting
material and cultural practices such as frequent disinfection of
cutting knives, insect control and keeping leaf surfaces dry.
