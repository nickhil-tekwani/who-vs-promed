A total of 6 people in Armenia's Ararat Region was hospitalized due to food poisoning. [According to the] result of the diagnostic analysis, they were poisoned by botulism in canned vegetables prepared at home. After consuming the [vegetables], [the people showed] signs of botulism, including weakness, headache, and difficulties with swallowing.

Another case of poisoning was registered in Artsakh [Nagorno-Karabakh] with a fatal end. A 65 year old resident of Saratak village [Shirak province] consumed canned red pepper on 17 Jan 2013 and on the next day he felt weak and was hospitalized. His health deteriorated, however, and he was transferred to Yerevan on 25 Jan 2013, where he died the following day.

Armenian Ministry of Healthcare again warns the citizens to avoid consuming canned food prepared at home.

[When botulism does occur related to food, it is most likely to be home-prepared as in this case. It should be noted that in typical foodborne botulism, the toxin is preformed in the food when ingested. Infant botulism (and its very rare adult equivalent, adult intestinal toxemia botulism) are caused by ingestion of spores, which germinate, and toxin is formed _in situ_. - Mod.LL
