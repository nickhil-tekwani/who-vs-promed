Alert: 3 new Florida counties with rust on kudzu; Madison County is
1st to have rust in grower field
-----------------------------------------------
Florida has updated its list of counties with confirmed Asian soybean
rust [ASR] infections, adding 2 more counties with [ASR] infected
kudzu. Moreover, the 1st commercial soybean field in Florida is
Madison county. That brings the total number of Florida counties
positive for ASR in 2005 to 12, exactly half of the U.S. counties
known to have ASR this year [2005].
The new counties with ASR on kudzu are Alachua (central Florida),
Hamilton (north central) and one just confirmed at noon today [8 Aug
2005]: Lee County on the southwest coast of Florida. Alachua was a
declared ASR-positive county in 2004, Hamilton and Lee are new
counties of record.
Jim Walker, biological scientist with the Florida Department of
Agriculture and Consumer Services, Division of Plant Industry, said
today [8 Aug 2005] that the announcement on the USDA site last
Thursday [4 Aug 2005] was incorrect in naming Hamilton as the 1st
Florida county infected with ASR in a commercial field. ASR was found
by a grower in his field in Madison County in north central Florida,
one county east of infected Jefferson County, and was confirmed by
PCR testing on 3 Aug 2005. Madison County also had ASR in 2004.
The Hamilton and Alachua findings confirmed in the report earlier
today [8 Aug 2005] were both kudzu samples scouted by Walker and
confirmed by PCR testing on 4 Aug 2005. 5 counties in a row along
Florida's border with Georgia are infected with ASR; and Alachua,
home to Gainesville and the University of Florida labs that test the
rust samples, joins its neighbor Marion County as an ASR-infected
county in central Florida.
The Alachua kudzu patch was small, and the infection was very light,
Walker said. The Hamilton County site was also small, but the
infection was of moderate severity, he said. The samples were taken
when it was quite dry, but Walker expects more disease activity now
that it has been wet for a few days.
The Lee County kudzu sample was pulled on 2 Aug 2005 and had been in
for testing until today's [8 Aug 2005] positive confirmation. Lee is
on the southwest coast of Florida, home to Fort Myers. No counties
along the southwest coast were positive for ASR in 2004.
Walker said the misnaming last week [final week July 2005] of
Hamilton County for the soybean field finding was a typographical
error. He is trying to find out more about the Madison County
location shortly.
The 12 confirmed ASR-infected counties are: Dade, Hernando, Pasco,
Marion, Jefferson, Leon, Gadsden, Escambia, Alachua, Madison,
Hamilton and Lee.

[Plant pathologists in Florida are recommending that growers consider
spraying for ASR as their plants approach bloom. All soybean fields
should continue to be monitored closely for disease development and
sprayed with fungicide if they are ASR-infected. This recommendation
is being made now because of recent positive findings on kudzu and
soybean in the panhandle, experience with rapid disease increase on
soybean in the Marion County sentinel plot, continuing high humidity
(which favors disease development), the bloom stage of the soybean
crop, and the possible involvement of tropical storms Arlene and
Dennis in distributing spores.
Experts suggest that a fungicide application may be warranted. For
Escambia and Hamilton and adjacent counties, the risk of disease may
be higher than for the other counties in the panhandle where ASR has
not been detected. However, large areas of kudzu could very well be
harboring ASR, which would increase the load of ASR spores in the
region.
