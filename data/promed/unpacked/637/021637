---------------------------------------------------------------------
Recently, a biologist in [Copey de Dota, in the province of San Jose] Costa Rica acquired rabies while working in a cave. For over 5 decades, Costa Rica has reported the lowest rates of rabies in Central America (El Salvador reports the highest rates), both in terms of cases and cases per 100 000 population [1,2]. Costa Rica also reports the lowest incidence of animal rabies for the region.

[We appreciate Dr Berger reminding us of these statistics. While it is true Costa Rica has the lowest reported rate, nevertheless, a bat exposure has occurred. Given the biologist's condition, it is sad, but likely a fatality, based on length of time between the suspected bite and any attempt at treatment. Rabies is fatal without treatment in a timely fashion. - Mod.TG

The clinical course of the biologist who was bitten by a bat in a cave in Copey de Dota, Costa Rica is available in the ProMED-mail post referenced above (20181028.6117187). Rabies is almost always fatal in unvaccinated individuals once symptoms have developed. - Mod.ML
