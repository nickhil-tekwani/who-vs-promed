Adult and Pediatric VAQTA Hepatitis A Vaccine Recall - USA
----------------------------------------------------------
[The following statements relate to the VAQTA adult and
pediatric hepatitis A vaccines, which are already subject to recall
throughout the European Union: see above ProMED-mail archive
references. - Mod.CP.
(1) The list of lots that are affected by a US recall. Only pre-filled
syringes are affected.
(2) Recalled lots would only have been available after 29 May 2001
(Adult VAQTA) and 9 Aug 1999 (Pediatric VAQTA).
(3) The problem is less widespread than the situation in Europe and
affects approximately 170 000 doses.
(4) Merck will credit customer accounts for returned product and
shipping and administrative costs.
(5) Merck will provide free antibody testing for patients immunized
with affected lots and will provide free vaccine for those with
inadequate titers.
Current understanding is that all VAQTA is manufactured in the USA
[by Merck and is all shipped to the UK for syringe loading [by
Powderject, a division of Evans Medical. Thus all end product comes
from only one source [and the problem is thought to relate to the
syringe filing process rather than the vaccine itself - Mod.CP.

[From information obtained by ProMED-mail these vaccines are
marketed within the European Union (EU) by Aventis Pasteur MSD,
and by Merck in the USA (and possibly elsewhere). The vaccine is
produced in the USA and prepared for distribution as pre-filled
syringes in the UK. It is not clear from the above statements whether
this recall has been or will be extended to vaccine distributed world-
wide. Merck has been slow to respond to the recall previously initiated
by Aventis Pasteur MSD in the EU. As of 14 Dec 2001, the lot numbers
of the recalled product are now available at
