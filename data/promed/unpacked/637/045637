Brazilian ticks that carry Rocky Mountain spotted fever passed the disease to animal hosts in as little as 10 minutes if they had recently fed on another animal, a new study found. "The current literature, including medical textbooks and guidelines for the general public, has repeatedly advised that an infected tick requires a minimum feeding period varying from 2 to 10 hours to transmit _Rickettsia rickettsii_ -- the bacterium that causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever -- to humans," Marcelo Labruna told Reuters Health in an email. "We believe our results will change some of our current recommendations for the prevention of Rocky Mountain spotted fever in endemic areas," said Labruna, a researcher at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil and senior author of the study.

Rocky Mountain spotted fever is the deadliest known rickettsial disease spread by several species of ticks that carry the bacterium and transmit them to the hosts they feed on, including dogs and humans. In Brazil, where the disease is known as Brazilian spotted fever, 20-40 percent of people who are infected die as a result, Labruna and his colleagues write in the journal Emerging Infectious Disease. Ticks transmit infections when they feed on a host, which they only do during short periods during their life cycles. The rest of the time, they are "free living" and their metabolism slows down to a semi-dormant state, the authors write. Reawakening to feed involves physical changes in the tick, which may alter the tick's ability to transmit disease at 1st.

To see whether the ticks' ability to transmit disease differs depending on whether it is unfed or has already fed, the researchers experimented with _Amblyomma aureolatum_, the main carrier of Rocky Mountain spotted fever in the Sao Paulo area.

First, they allowed hungry bacteria-infested ticks to feed on guinea pigs for 2 to 48 hours. Next the study team allowed infected ticks to feed on rabbits for 48 hours before transferring them to guinea pigs. These ticks were left on the guinea pigs for anywhere from 1 minute to 168 hours. All the guinea pigs were then monitored for signs of the disease. Of the 24 guinea pigs exposed to unfed adult ticks, 10 remained uninfected after 10 hours of tick exposure. Guinea pigs exposed to ticks that had 1st fed on the rabbits remained uninfected when ticks were removed after less than 5 minutes of feeding time, but one became infected when the tick was left to feed for just 10 minutes.

Labruna said it's not known for sure how often ticks that have fed on other animals bite people but epidemiological data indicates that it is very common in some areas. "For example, in the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo, nearly 70 percent of the Rocky Mountain spotted fever cases have occurred in children and adult women, who usually did not enter the forest habitat of the tick as frequently as did adult men," he said. He added that 93 percent of the cases in that area have been associated with direct contact with dogs.

"Our results highlight that dogs are much more important than previously thought in the epidemiology of Rocky Mountain spotted fever in Brazil," he said. "Within endemic areas, efforts to keep dogs free of ticks should be much more intensive."

In the USA, a different tick, known as a wood tick or dog tick, is the primary carrier of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Patrick Liesch, an entomologist with the University of Wisconsin in Madison, said the simplest way for people and pets to avoid tick-borne disease is to avoid areas where ticks are likely to occur. "Weedy areas and wooded areas are favorite hangouts for ticks," he told Reuters Health in an email. He added that dressing accordingly can help prevent ticks from getting to your skin and can make it easier to see them. Wearing light-colored, long-sleeved shirts and pants can make it easier to spot ticks before they have a chance to bite," he said. "Tucking pants into socks can also limit the ability of ticks to get down to skin level."

Leisch also suggests using tick repellents, such as DEET and permethrin, and performing a thorough tick check after visiting tick-infested areas. "Educating yourself about ticks is a final important consideration," Leisch said. "By thoroughly 'knowing your enemy,' you'll have a better understanding of what to keep an eye out for."

He suggests the University of Rhode Island's 'Tick Encounter' website at http://www.tickencounter.org. "There's a wealth of information on the site, and you can even access a tick identification chart, which highlights the main species of ticks in your region of the USA, so you can learn what to watch for," Leisch said.

Labruna added that people should be "re-educated" to know that a tick does not necessarily need as long as 2 hours of attachment for transmission of _R. rickettsii_. "Actually, they must have in mind that a much shorter period, namely 10 minutes, could result in successful inoculation of the bacterium," he said.

Labruna also said the general recommendation of searching the body for attached ticks every 1 or 2 hours while walking within endemic areas may not be sufficient if the person is in direct contact with dogs.

Saraiva DG, Soares HS, Soares JF, Labruna MB: Feeding period required by _Amblyomma aureolatum_ ticks for transmission of _Rickettsia rickettsii_ to vertebrate hosts.
Emerg Infect Dis. 2014 Sep;20: 1504-1510:

"Rocky Mountain spotted fever is endemic to the Sao Paulo metropolitan area, Brazil, where the etiologic agent, _Rickettsia rickettsii_, is transmitted to humans by adult _Amblyomma aureolatum_ ticks. We determined the minimal feeding period required by _A. aureolatum_ nymphs and adults to transmit _R. rickettsii_ to guinea pigs. Unfed nymphs and unfed adult ticks had to be attached to the host for greater than 10 hours to transmit _R. rickettsii_. In contrast, fed ticks needed a minimum of 10 minutes of attachment to transmit _R. rickettsii_ to hosts. Most confirmed infections of Rocky Mountain spotted fever in humans in the Sao Paulo metropolitan area have been associated with contact with domestic dogs, the main host of _A. aureolatum_ adult ticks. The typical expectation that transmission of tickborne bacteria to humans as well as to dogs requires 2 or more hours of tick attachment may discourage persons from immediately removing them and result in transmission of this lethal bacterium."

As reviewed by Ebel and Kramer (1) in their paper regarding efficient transmission of the Powassan virus (a tickborne cause of viral encephalitis in North America) in as few as 15 minutes of time of attachment, the "grace period" as it is often called (the time from initial attachment to pathogen transmission) is usually reported to be substantially longer, 12-24 hours. The pathophysiology of this process is complex and appears to be related to a change from a more metabolically inactive state and migration from the tick's hemocoel (primary body cavity) and into the salivary glands. This moderator has, since Infectious Disease training, been aware of Spencer and Parker's report with Rocky Mountain spotted fever that usually 48 hours of feeding were required for transmission (I always taught 24 hours) (2). Similar timing of transmission exists for _Borrelia burgdorferi_ where only 1 of 14 rodents were infected after 24 hours of feeding, 5 of 14 after 48 hours and 13 of 14 after 72 hours (3). 36 hours seemed to be the grace period for anaplasmosis (4) and efficient transmission was best greater than 48 hours for babesiosis (5).

The Saraiva study shows that previously unfed ticks required feeding for at least 10 hours to transmit _R. rickettsi_ with the _A. aureolatum_ vector (in contrast to _Dermacentor_ ticks in the USA) but if previously partially fed, transmission could occur in as little as 10 minutes. It is of course unclear if this applies to other tick vectors or other tickborne bacterial or protozoan pathogens. This observation, however, could explain why the tickborne relapsing fever _Borrelia_ can be transmitted despite a characteristic rapid feeding of only 20-30 minutes (6) since it is possible that the ticks are more frequent feeders.

This finding is paradoxical to me. If infected ticks have virus in their salivary glands, and previously partially fed ones can transmit in 10 mins, why does it take unfed ones, also with virus in their salivary glands, 10 hours? Does it take unfed ticks that long to produce enough saliva? I will obviously have to read the papers. - Mod.JW
