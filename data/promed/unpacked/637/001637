[2] Liberia: Post-Ebola syndrome
Date: May 15, 2015

http://knpr.org/npr/2015-05/its-story-job-ebola-survivors-who-continue-suffer


An Ebola survivor has had significant swelling in her jaw and says at times she can't close her mouth or swallow. She has also suffered headaches and for a while had trouble seeing out of her right eye. Another, whose pregnant girlfriend and one of his sons died of Ebola, came down with the disease himself but recovered in September 2014. That should have been good news for the 30 year old Liberian. But his suffering continued.

As he was preparing to leave an Ebola treatment unit, a friend warned him not to return to his rented room in the Virginia section of Monrovia. He'd been evicted and all of his belongings burned in the street. "I was not even there when everything was burned off," he told me. So he moved in with his mother and grandmother in another part of the Liberian capital. There were already 20 people living in the small house on a sandy lot shaded by mango trees. Lasana slept in a room with the younger boys.

He was having pain in his back and his legs. He figured the aching would go away as his body recovered. But it didn't. In fact, the pain got worse. It now moves around, he says, in ways that don't make sense to him. "It come from the legs to the back, to the hands, fingers. That's the pain I'm feeling," he says. Sometimes his left wrist swells up and he gets a shooting pain in his hand. He describes it as if a needle is being driven into his palm. He used to do construction but hasn't worked since he left the Ebola treatment unit last fall. He says he can no longer grip a hammer or a saw.

His experience is not the norm for Ebola survivors. Most purge the virus from their bodies and slowly regain strength. But it's becoming clear that for some survivors, serious medical problems persist for months: joint pain, muscle pain, fatigue. Monika Niemiec, a physician at a clinic Medecins sans Frontieres [MSF; Doctors Without Borders] has set up in Monrovia just for Ebola survivors, says they see a wide array of medical issues: joint pain, muscle pain, fatigue, menstrual irregularities in women, rashes. Many survivors come in with eye problems. Some have cloudy vision. Others have pain around the eye socket. And, she says, "a number of patients" whose visual complaints went untreated for several weeks ended up losing their sight.

This MSF clinic has seen nearly 200 Ebola survivors since January [2015]. The missionary medical charity SIM [Serving in Mission] also treats what's coming to be called post-Ebola syndrome at a separate facility across town. Niemiec says it's really too early to say what's causing these medical problems. Was it the Ebola virus? The treatment? Or are these underlying conditions that were present before the individual fell ill?

And how much of this is related to trauma? Not only have survivors stepped back from the brink of death, but most of them lost loved ones. Many haven't been able to resume their pre-Ebola lives. Niemiec says the factors causing these medical conditions for Ebola survivors need a lot more study.

For [the young man described], his current situation remains bleak. Ebola took his girlfriend, his son, his home and his health. But the one routine he still has from his pre-Ebola life is going to church every week. It gives him faith, he says, that things will get better.

[3] Sierra Leone: tracking technology
Date: 16 May 2015
Source: Reuters [edited]
http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/foreign/16-May-2015/nurses-with-tablets-and-bikers-with-smartphones-join-ebola-fight


While health experts in laboratories globally have tried to devise ways to end the largest Ebola epidemic on record, technology experts have also been coming up with new ways to attack the virus -- using smartphones and Ebola-proof tablets [tablet computers. - Mod.SH].

Recording and tracking the victims of Ebola in the West African nations of Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia has proved a major challenge since the outbreak started in December 2013 and spread rapidly, killing more than 11 000 people.

Ivan Gayton, an emergency coordinator with the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), said inefficient tracking was not helping, with workers in treatment centres sharing information about patients by shouting it over a fence to colleagues in a low-risk zone to record by hand. For workers were aware that it was not just bodily fluids that could spread the disease but also contaminated paper and clipboards -- which triggered the idea of an Ebola-free tablet.

So Gayton teamed up with a Dutch developer Pim De Witte, founder of a technology company called Whitespell, to devise an Ebola-proof tablet, aided by funding from Google. An off-the-shelf device is given a polycarbonate shell to make it waterproof and chlorine resistant and charged wirelessly so it does not need to be taken in and out of contamination zones.

Workers punch in data about patients, which can be stored, tracked and analysed externally. The interface is optimised for people wearing steamy goggles and thick plastic gloves.

All the software, including the design for the shell which is made by 3D printing, is open source, meaning anyone can download and improve it. Data can be stored on the tablet when there is no signal, and uploaded later. "It's actually really complicated to make it simple," Gayton told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

He said the software took a while to roll out because of extensive testing but went into use in February [2015] when the virus was on the wane. This month [May 2015] Liberia was declared Ebola-free. "We were late to the party ... we had to err on the side of 1st do no harm," said Gayton, but added that he hoped the device would be useful in future disease outbreaks.

Tracking victims around West Africa also proved difficult. When health workers arrived in the Tonkolili district of northern Sierra Leone, they had limited information about the names, location and details of villages they needed to help. "A lot of information was missing," said Laura Nic Lochlainn, a fellow at the RIVM National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in the Netherlands, who travelled to Sierra Leone this year [2015] with an MSF team to find a solution.

For a 2-week trial, researchers employed local people to scoot around the province on small motorbikes known as okadas, collecting household, health and population data from villages on simple smartphones. They travelled in pairs, 1 riding the motorbike and 1 using a GPS-enabled smartphone running an Android operating system, preloaded with a specially designed, simple programme for storing the necessary information. When they arrived in a village they interviewed a village leader or representative to gather as much information as possible, and log GPS coordinates, essential in a region where village names are often duplicated or spelt differently.

Nic Lochlainn said it takes a long time to learn to use the sophisticated satellite devices usually used for mapping, but users could master this software in [just] hours, and the data let experts assign Ebola cases to specific villages more accurately.

http://www.sciencetimes.com/articles/6402/20150516/can-ebola-stay-hidden-in-the-orbits-of-the-eye.htm


[A US doctor] fought Ebola for his life for an extended period of time at Emory University Hospital until, in October [2015], the lengthy, bloody battle seemed to have ended with him the victor. But not even 2 months later searing pressure and pain in his left eye and failing sight landed him back in the hospital. His terrifying discovery? The Ebola virus was thriving inside his eye.

Naturally, his medical team realized there could be a connection to his recent bout with Ebola, but these results were yet surprising. [His] blood was free of the virus when he left the hospital. Experts know that the virus may remain in semen for some months after it disappears from the blood, but previous to this case they had no information about the ability of the Ebola virus to live on inside the eyeball.

Thankfully, the surface of his eye and his tears were free of the virus; casual contact with him posed no threat to others.

"I want to emphasize that as far as we know, the Ebola virus is not transmitted by casual contact," the American Academy of Ophthalmology said in a statement. "The current study does not suggest that infection can be transmitted through contact with tears or the ocular surface of patients who have recovered from their initial infection."

From: Sukie Crandall <sukie@mac.com>


Sukie Crandall asks: Was the green a light green, or was it olive green?

The reason I ask is because for many years I used Lumigan [bimatoprost, a drug used topically. - Mod.SH] for glaucoma, and the added pigment caused eye color changes. Although my eyes, which had been grey-blue looked olive green what were actually present were brown flecks. Some people reverse when Lumigan is stopped and I am among those whose brown flecks are decreasing so that I am now closer to my original eye color.

Since lost pigment can interfere with drainage, intraocular pressure (IOP) and visual field may be some things the physician's medical team might want to check if that is the situation. Pigment can also be lost with age, and with some mitochondrial disorders.

[In the past few days, several new chains of transmission have emerged in Freetown, Kambia and Port Loko. After 8 days of 0 new Ebola cases, across several communities, there are 5 new confirmed cases currently admitted at treatment centers, 270 people under quarantine, 1 new Ebola death and 73 high-risk cases waiting for test results. The source of this new eruption of Ebola cases centers around a young man who escaped quarantine after he lost his fiancee to Ebola and moved to another community, where he fell sick and started exhibiting Ebola signs and symptoms. While sick, he came into contact with many other people including his mother, friends, relatives and a nurse who was administering medication to him secretly in his room]

[During the height of the Ebola outbreak, while donations flooded into the West African countries worst hit by the outbreak, hundreds, if not thousands, of nurses and other frontline staff fighting Ebola have been underpaid throughout the outbreak -- and many remain unpaid.
