Cocoa disease takes toll
------------------------
Nigeria may miss its cocoa output target of 500 000 metric tons in the 2014-15 season after an outbreak of fungal blackpod disease devastated farms following heavy rains.

"The devastating effect of the excessive rains last August and September [2014] is now telling on the overall harvest," Adeola Adegoke, Cocoa Farmers Association, said. "The season virtually ended in November [2014]."

The southwest region that accounts for 2/3 of the country's output, is reporting the absence of the "December cocoa harvest boom" that usually supplies 35 to 40 percent of output, according to Adegoke. "We lost this to the heavy rains," he said. In the southeastern areas, there is less impact of blackpod disease.

[Black pod (also called _Phytophthora_ pod rot) is the primary fungal disease affecting cocoa worldwide. In Africa, the fungus-like pathogens _Phytophthora palmivora_ and _P. megakarya_ are associated with it, but 2 additional species are found in the Americas. _P. palmivora_ is the most common pathogen and can cause yield losses as high as 95 percent in very humid climates, with every pod affected. Pods progressively turn dark brown. Losses are most severe when pods are infected during the 2 months prior to ripening. The disease also causes stem cankers, which are estimated to kill up to 10 percent of trees annually.

Black pod is spread by insect activity, mechanical means, plant debris, water and wind. Multiple infections from several sources may occur in plantations, with epiphytotics developing from a series of foci simultaneously. Genetic resistance is generally low in commercial cocoa cultivars. Disease management is difficult and needs an integrated approach, including cultural techniques, phytosanitary measures and targeted fungicide use.

To prevent problems with rain wash-off of foliar fungicides, trunk injections with phosphorous compounds have been shown to be an effective alternative. Similar methods are being used in the control of _P. cinnamomi_ diseases in some tree species, for example jarrah dieback and avocado root rot in Australia. The mode of the protective action of these compounds against _Phytophthora_ species is still being investigated.
