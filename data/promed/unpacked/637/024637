In recent years there has been growing interest in links between El Nino
(and other extreme weather events) and human health. A number of studies
have demonstrated that pronounced changes in the incidence of diseases can
occur in parallel with the extreme weather conditions associated with the
El Nino cycle.
"El Nino" is the familiar term given to the Christ child in Latin American
Spanish. It is also used to describe an anomaly in the flow of ocean waters
along the west coast of South America, which can occur around Christmas
time - hence El Nino. This anomaly is the result of the nutrient-rich cold
water of the coastal Humboldt Current being replaced by eastward-flowing
warm ocean water (which is nutrient poor) from the equatorial Pacific. El
Nino events have occurred every 3 to 5 years, on average, since
meteorological records began in 1877, and they are associated with
catastrophic declines in fisheries along the Pacific coast of South America.
The Southern Oscillation (SO) is a large-scale atmospheric "see-saw"
centred over the equatorial Pacific Ocean. The variation in pressure is
accompanied in surrounding areas by fluctuations in wind strengths, ocean
currents, sea surface temperatures and precipitation. The SO and the warm
waters of the El Nino are part of the same climate phenomenon referred to
as ENSO (El Nino/ Southern Oscillation). ENSO influences climate in distant
regions: droughts in South-East Asia, parts of Australia, and parts of
Africa, and heavy rainfall and flooding in arid areas of Africa and South
America, have been observed during El Nino years, while the Indian summer
monsoon sometimes weakens and winters in western Canada and parts of the
northern United States of America become milder. Overall, disasters
triggered by drought are twice as frequent worldwide during El Nino years.
Forecasting techniques to predict and measure El Nino events have improved
dramatically in recent years. According to one of these techniques (the
multivariate ENSO index), there were 3 such extreme events during the
1950-1980 period but, since 1984, there have already been 4 major El Ninos.
The longest single El Nino period on record occurred from 1990-1995.
Whether or not this apparent increase is related to global warming has not
yet been established.
An increasing array of studies demonstrate significant associations between
the ENSO cycle, climate phenomena and human health. El Nino and similar
weather disturbances affect human health mainly through natural disasters
and related outbreaks of infectious diseases. It is impossible to estimate,
however, how many human deaths and illnesses are directly linked to El
Nino, as the health effects result from a complex interaction of abnormal
weather events with factors such as population, over-crowding, health
status and sanitation infrastructure.
El Nino can cause dramatically increased or decreased rainfall, which can
lead directly to natural disasters such as floods or droughts. In addition,
high wind events such as tornadoes may increase in frequency or intensity.
These effects can occur at great distances from the ENSO phenomenon and
tend to be more dramatic in particular areas. These disasters may cause
direct injuries and deaths, destroy crops and property, lead to famine and
interrupt development. They make already-vulnerable populations more
vulnerable. Research has shown that the numbers of people affected by
natural disasters worldwide are greater during the first El Nino year and
the following year than in the pre-El Nino year.
The 1997 El Nino has already been associated with drought-related forest
fires originating in Indonesia, which have, in turn, resulted in a dramatic
increase in respiratory disease visits in Kuala Lumpur General Hospital and
in the State of Sarawak (both in Malaysia). These fires have mainly been
caused by human activity but the lack of seasonal rains has led to their
spread over wide areas and the fires are now affecting virgin rain forest.
Similar fires are being witnessed in the Amazon rain forest and pose a
major ecological threat to both farming and traditional indigenous
communities. At present, drought-related famine is threatening countries
such as Sudan and the Philippines. In 1997-1998, El Nino has also been
associated with very destructive flooding in South America. Ecuador and
Peru have been particularly affected.
Strong evidence exists of linkages between these weather variations and
increases in the incidence of infectious diseases, such as insect
vector-borne diseases (e.g. malaria, Rift Valley fever) and epidemic
diarrhoeal diseases (e.g. cholera and shigellosis).
Climatic factors, such as changes in temperature and humidity, are known to
be capable of facilitating or interrupting the capacity of insect vectors
to transmit disease to humans. Malaria and Rift Valley fever are 2 diseases
for which substantial documentation in this area exists. Less well
documented, but of increasing interest, are the effects of ENSO on dengue.
This largely urban disease, present in tropical regions around the world,
is spread by mosquitoes that breed in artificial containers. Thus, in
addition to climatic factors, changes in domestic water storage practices,
brought about by disruption of regular supplies, will also influence
patterns of transmission.
El Nino events have an impact on malaria control in many parts of the world
because the associated weather disturbances influence vector breeding
sites, and hence the transmission potential of the disease. It has been
recognised that many areas experience a dramatic increase in the incidence
of malaria during extreme weather events correlated to El Nino. Moreover,
outbreaks may not only be larger, but more severe, as populations affected
may not have high levels of immunity. Quantitative leaps in malaria
incidence coincident with ENSO events have been recorded around the world;
such epidemics have been documented in Bolivia, Columbia, Ecuador, Peru and
Venezuela in South America, in Rwanda in Africa, and in Pakistan and Sri
Lanka in Asia. Historically, in the Punjab region of north-eastern
Pakistan, the risk of malaria epidemics increases five-fold during the year
following a major El Nino, and in Sri Lanka, the risk of a malaria epidemic
increases four-fold during an El Nino year.
These increased risks are associated with above-average levels of
precipitation in the Punjab and below-average levels of precipitation in
Sri Lanka. In South America and Rwanda, heavy rainfall has contributed to
major epidemics of malaria. To be able to forecast the impact of El Nino in
different endemic areas, control programmes need to develop a thorough
understanding of how local vector species respond to climate variability,
and how a population's immunity and nutritional status fluctuate over time.
To organize a timely and effective epidemic response, malaria control
programmes need to incorporate surveillance and epidemic control in their
everyday activities.
Outbreaks of Rift Valley fever (RVF), a vector-borne disease that
principally infects livestock, have occurred in eastern Africa on almost
every occasion that there has been excessive rainfall. As a result of the
1997 El Nino, areas of north-eastern Kenya and southern Somalia experienced
rainfall which was 60-100 times heavier than normal - the heaviest recorded
rainfall since 1961. The rains, which began in October 1997 and continued
through January 1998, caused RVF virus-infected eggs of floodwater _Aedes_
sp. mosquitoes to hatch. In the outbreak of RVF that followed, livestock
losses were considerable in the affected regions.
Moreover, the estimated toll of human death due to RVF in the region was
200-250, while there were an estimated 89,000 human cases of RVF in
north-eastern Kenya and southern Somalia. Other areas of Kenya, and the
United Republic of Tanzania were also affected with widespread animal
infections; however, their impact on the human population was not as great.
Preliminary estimates of infections and deaths among animals and humans
suggest this may be the largest outbreak of RVF ever reported.
These are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in many countries.
Outbreaks can be related either to floods or drought (floods, for example,
contaminate water supply, while droughts make hygiene more difficult and
contaminate the water that remains).
There is circumstantial evidence to indicate a close association between
weather changes caused by El Nino and cholera. Since September/October
1997, there has been a deteriorating cholera situation in the Horn of
Africa. After heavy rainfall and floods, most of the countries in this
region reported a dramatic upsurge in the numbers of cases of and deaths
due to cholera. In 1997, a total of 40,249 cholera cases with 2,231 deaths
were reported in Tanzania alone (compared with 1,464 cases and 35 deaths in
1996).
Kenya reported 17,200 cases and 555 deaths and Somalia 6,814 cases and 252
deaths due to cholera in 1997. With the floods continuing in this region
and adding to already limited sanitation, poor hygiene and unsafe water,
conditions favour the spread of cholera. At the end of 1997 other countries
bordering the Horn of Africa, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo
and Mozambique, were reporting increased numbers of cholera cases and
deaths. Reported figures through the first 3 months of 1998 already showed
11 335 cases and 525 deaths in Uganda, and 10 108 cases and 507 deaths in
Kenya.
In the Americas, the current cholera epidemic has been raging for 7 years
and, associated with a major El Nino, the number of cholera cases started
to increase at the end of 1997. In 1998, Peru has been suffering from a
major outbreak and has already reported, for the first 3 months of 1998, 16
705 cases and 146 deaths. Other countries which are reporting increasing
numbers of cholera cases in 1998 are Bolivia, Honduras and Nicaragua.
A study examining the relationship between sea surface temperature and
cholera case data in Bangladesh during 1994 documented a close association
between those 2 variables.
Measures to predict and prevent disease outbreaks related to El Nino are
increasing. In south-eastern Africa and the Horn of Africa, the regional
WHO Cholera Surveillance Teams, warned by early forecasts of El
Nino-related extreme weather events in 1997, were able to help reduce the
severity of the cholera outbreak in those regions by means of increased
monitoring and heightened preparedness of health care institutions in the
area.
The Southern Oscillation Index has been used to predict the probability of
epidemics of vector-borne diseases (such as Murray Valley Encephalitis in
Australia). Satellite remote sensing, used to detect areas of abnormal
precipitation via increases in vegetation, highlighted exactly those areas
which were hit by the RVF outbreak in east Africa in late 1997 and early
1998. The use of mathematical modelling techniques to predict the spread of
malaria into new areas in relation to climate changes are also being used
(e.g. in Kenya).
WHO is a member of the "climate agenda programme", a United Nations
inter-agency programme which integrates all major international
climate-related activities. Within this mechanism, WHO plays a major role
in linking the monitoring of health impacts with the monitoring of climate
and other associated impacts, and in assisting Member States to use
prediction and forecasting models to reduce the human impact of major
climatic events.
In December 1997, WHO, together with the United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP) and the UK Medical Research Council, held the first of a
series of workshops on climate change and human health. At the workshop,
the first steps towards drawing up an international research agenda were
taken. WHO's long-term objective is to use improvements in predicting and
monitoring unusual weather occurrences such as El Nino as an aid in taking
pre-emptive measures to reduce the public health impact of such events.
