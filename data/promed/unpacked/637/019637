[My hunch was right that the newspaper's spelling of the chemical TCE
was wrong. Many thanks to the many readers who sent in the correct
spelling, used here, together with the information that it is a
machinery degreaser, incidentally used as a dewormer in human
medicine 30 years ago, and is thought to be carcinogenic if it
doesn't kill you first.
Descriptions of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome & related nasty syndromes
caused by TCE follow. Note that SJS may sometimes have an infectious
origin - Mod.JW

The chemical referred to here is likely trichloroethylene, also known as
ethylene trichloride or triclene, and commonly abbreviated as TCE. It
is a colorless liquid, unless dyed, with a sweet odor like chloroform,
according to OSHA. It is probably a carcinogen, and exposure is
associated with a wide variety of nasty symptoms. OSHA has set exposure
limits, which can be found at:
<http://www.osha-slc.gov/ChemSamp_data/CH_273000.html>
Exposure to TCE is reported to cause a variety of symptoms, including
dermatological effects. This brings us to Stevens-Johnson Syndrome,
also called erythema multiforme major, which is a systemic disease
mostly involving the skin and mucous membranes. (I have also seen
references to SJS as being another name for toxic epidermal necrolysis.)
SJS, according to Leslie C. Grammer, MD, Northwestern University, is
believed to be the result of a cell-mediated hypersensitivity reaction
to a number of immunologic stimuli including drugs and infectious
agents. Further information can be found at, among other places,

Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is an immune system disorder with
mucocutaneous manifestations. Other terms applied to this disorder include:
ectodermosis erosiva pluriorificialis, erythema multiforme major and Johnson-
Stevens disease. SJS appears to be triggered by a number of
infectious agents and a number of drugs, in particular by sulfonamides, which
include silver sulfadiazine. This syndrome affects [up to 5 persons
per million each year; therefore, few health care professionals will
be familiar with this syndrome and its causes.
The lesions of erythema multiforme are elevated, darkly pigmented, and
hard initially (maculopapular) and distributed symmetrically. In the severe
form called SJS, the lesions become bullous (blistering) and may coalesce into
large blisters that rupture spontaneously. Within 72 hours of the development
of blisters, skin begins to slough off resembling a superficial or deep
partial thickness burn and individuals may be admitted to burn units for
treatment. Lip, oral, pharyngeal, and gastrointestinal involvement is common
and lesions may also coalesce on the mucous membranes, which can cause
difficulty with breathing, swallowing and may damage the conjunctiva
sufficiently to immobilize the eye.

All cases I've seen have been young boys (pre-puberty) that had taken
medication not intended for them. This is a very unpleasant condition!

From: David Ozonoff <dozonoff@bu.edu>

The substance at issue is trichloroethylene (official name trichloroethene)
or TCE, a widely used solvent, often used to degrease small metal parts.
Occupational exposures are widespread, common and continuing worldwide. In
the US it is the number two contaminant in groundwater at hazardous
waste.
It is implicated in several cancers (biliary tract, hematopoietic
and others). It has also been implicated in several autoimmune states,
including scleroderma and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (erythema multiforme
major), a serious dermatological condition with systemic complications (as
here), Goodpasture's Syndrome (glomerulonephritis) and lupus. TCE is
related to vinyl chloride (a known human carcinogen), in which the two
carbons joined by a double bond of ethyelene have one chlorine substituted
on them. Add two more chlorine substitutions and you have TCE.

The ATSDR ToxProfile on TCE reports a 1984 article reporting SJS in
five people occupationally exposed to TCE for 2-5 weeks at levels
from 19-164ppm. (Contact Dermatitis Vol 10, pp270-276.)
