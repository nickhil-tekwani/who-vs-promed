[Mod.JW's recommendation of rabies vaccination for petting zoo
and farm animals has one major problem. Rabies vaccines are not
approved for use in those species (by and large) and there is no data on
safety or efficacy.

I was unaware rabies vaccination was available for a bear. I knew
about canine, feline and ferret rabies vaccine. A species listing
would be helpful.

Parenteral rabies vaccines are licensed only for use in dogs, cats,
ferrets, cattle, sheep and horses in the US. The safety and efficacy of
these vaccines are not determined for other species.
As these are killed virus vaccines, there is no risk that they can cause
rabies infection. Off-label use in other mammals in zoologic settings is
not uncommon, as the vaccines may well provide some protection from
rabies infection to other species. However, one must be very cautious
not to impart a false sense of security based upon such "off-label" use.
The Compendium of Animal Rabies Control, prepared by the National
Association of State Public Health Veterinarians, Inc., recommends that
wild-caught animals be quarantined for a minimum of 180 days before
exhibition. In the midst of the intense raccoon rabies outbreak affecting
New York, our recommendations also include a warning that an "off-
label" vaccinated animal will be treated as unvaccinated if known to be
exposed to rabies, or if it bites or otherwise potentially exposes a human
to rabies.
Furthermore, we recommend that unvaccinated or "off-label"
vaccinated animals be restricted from from certain activities at fairs and
similar settings that encourage intimate contact with the public (e.g.,
petting zoos).
I don't think the last sentence above reduces the benefit of "off-label"
vaccination -- if the bear had been vaccinated, it PROBABLY would
NOT have become rabid -- if it didn't, all this would have been avoided.
We just cannot ASSUME the animal is protected if it bites someone,
since the efficacy of the vaccine is unproven in these species. The last
recommendation, restricting contact with the general public, is an effort
to limit the size of the investigation and number of people treated when
an animal on exhibit actually develops the disease.
The 180 day quarantine certainly will not exclude the possibility of
exposure at the zoo, and that is why that precaution, in itself, is not
adequate to preclude the other recommendations.

[There is great concern from an uninformed public that inappropriately
believes if the critter was vaccinated, then it is protected against the
disease. Although there may indeed be some limited protection, that is
not a guantee, nor do we know the length of time that partial protection
may exist. For example, we standardly vaccinate animals on an annual
basis, to keep the level of protection high. But in animals that are
vaccinated off label, is that protection appropriate for only 6 weeks, 6
months or a year? We don't know. Protection is afforded to some
extent, we just don't know what extent. - Mod.TG
