Emergency Management Warning 33: exotic Newcastle disease confirmed in the
United States
-------------------------------
Exotic Newcastle disease (END) was confirmed on 1 Oct 2002, in California,
and has now spread beyond backyard flocks to affect 6 commercial operations
in California. On 16 Jan 2003, END was also confirmed in a backyard flock
in Nevada. Infected birds exhibit respiratory, nervous, and
gastrointestinal signs.
Up to 90 per cent of exposed birds die. Investigations are on-going and all
figures are pending final validation. Veterinary Services is working
rapidly to expand staff on the task force in the states of California and
Nevada and is exploring all options to send APHIS personnel, other federal
government personnel, and is working with the states to consider additional
resources to meet the labor demands. APHIS is continuing to develop a plan
for national END surveillance. This plan will enhance the already extensive
surveillance underway in California and Nevada.
Nevada Situation (as of 5:00 pm PST, 2 Feb 2003)
END has been confirmed in a backyard flock in Las Vegas, NV. Federal and
State quarantines have been established for all of Clark County and a
portion of Nye County, NV. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has also
declared an extraordinary emergency. APHIS and the state of Nevada have
begun surveillance efforts of the backyard bird population and have
established a task force in Nevada.
Number of premises positive: 7 (no change from 1/31 report)
Number of contact premises: 84 (up 5 from 1/31 report)
Number of premises released: 0 (no change from 1/30 report)
Number of premises depopulated: 88
Premises waiting to be depopulated: 3
Birds depopulated to date: 1637
Counties with positive flocks: Clark
California Situation (as of 5:00 pm PST, 2 Feb 2003)
Officials with the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) and
APHIS continue to work closely on efforts to control the END outbreak in
southern California. USDA has instituted a federal quarantine zone that
serves as a buffer around the END affected area in southern California. The
department has also declared an extraordinary emergency to provide
additional resources and authorities to the eradication campaign for END in
southern California.
Number of premises positive: 473 (up 24 from 1/31 report)
Number of contact premises: 1024 (up 37 from 1/31 report)
Number of premises released: 28 (no change from 1/31 report)
Number of premises depopulated: 1347
Premises waiting to be depopulated: 178
Birds depopulated to date: 1 790 135
Counties with positive flocks: Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San
Bernardino, San Diego, Ventura
Operational Update
Of the 91 premises in Nevada designated for depopulation, 96.7 per cent
have been completed.
Of the 1525 premises in California designated for depopulation, 88.3 per
cent have been completed.
Effective on 7 Jan 2003, APHIS imposed a federal quarantine that regulates
the interstate movement of all species of birds and poultry products from
Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa
Barbara, and Ventura counties, CA.
Effective 17 Jan 2003, APHIS imposed a federal quarantine that regulates
the interstate movement of all species of birds and poultry products from
Clark and a portion of Nye County, NV.
USDA has declared an extraordinary emergency for the States of California
and Nevada. These declarations allow USDA to apply federal authority within
California and Nevada.
Task force personnel are conducting a door-to-door campaign to identify
affected premises. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. Entities
that sell birds continue to be monitored in affected areas. If a flock
tests positive, officials will quarantine the premises immediately and
order the destruction of the flock as soon as it is logistically possible.
Veterinary officials from Mexico are currently observing Task Force
surveillance, depopulation, and cleaning and disinfection operations in
California and Nevada.
Outreach Activities
Tribal Nations in the States of Arizona, California, and Nevada have been
contacted by APHIS representatives and have been updated on the END
situation. Continued outreach information is being supplied on a continuous
basis.
Task force information personnel prepared and distributed PowerPoint
presentations and program documents to the Las Vegas Incident Command Post.
Information personnel also reviewed and drafted responses for 2 letters
from the public regarding Task force activities.
Task force public information personnel are communicating daily on their
surveillance, depopulation, and cleaning and disinfection operations to all
affected city managers in southern California. They field about 450 calls
per week from the public, a 20-fold increase from the number of calls from
early October 2002. Presently, the public information staff have 9 public
meetings scheduled between now and 10 Mar 2003, not including meetings
scheduled with bird clubs and other industry associations.
Task force public information personnel are designing a
door-hanger/information envelope for use by field crews at individual
residences in affected areas. The task force has requested the
establishment of a contract with a public relations firm for radio, direct
mailing, print advertisement, and other specific minority outreach
activities. The task force's public information staff, in cooperation with
Legislative and Public Affairs in Riverdale, MD, is preparing 2 new
documents for distribution: The revised END brochure (which has been
updated to include new information and photographs) and the END pest alert
fact sheet. Delivery is anticipated within the next 3 weeks.
Each day, the task force information staff provide media updates to about
35 media outlets in California. In Area Command alone, the public
information personnel handle an average of 50 media calls per week.
