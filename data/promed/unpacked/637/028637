_Salmonella_ Outbreaks Linked to Pet Bearded Dragons
----------------------------------------------------
Fast Facts
----------
Illnesses: 23
Hospitalizations: 8
Deaths: 0
States: 15
Investigation status: Active

CDC and public health officials in several US states are collecting different types of data to investigate 2 multistate outbreaks of _Salmonella_ infections with serotypes Vitkin and IIIb 61:z52:z53. Epidemiologic and laboratory data show that contact with pet bearded dragons is making people sick in both outbreaks.

Epidemiologic Data
------------------
As of 12 Oct 2022, a total of 23 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ Vitkin (10 people) and _Salmonella_ IIIb 61:z52:z53 (13 people) have been reported from 15 states (see map https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/beardeddragon-10-22/map.html). Illnesses started on dates ranging from 24 Mar 2021, to 13 Sep 2022 (see timeline https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/beardeddragon-10-22/epi.html).

State of Residence / Number of Sick People
------------------------------------------
California / 3
Idaho / 1
Iowa / 2
Kentucky / 1
Michigan / 1
Minnesota / 2
New Jersey / 1
New York / 3
Ohio / 2
Oklahoma / 1
Pennsylvania / 2
Tennessee / 1
Utah / 1
Virginia / 1
Wisconsin / 1

Sick people range in age from less than 1 to 75 years, with a median age of 2 years old, and 10 (43%) are children under the age of 1 year old. Thirteen (57%) patients are female. Of 17 people with information available, 8 (47%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. The true number of sick people in an outbreak is likely much higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because many people recover without medical care and are not tested for _Salmonella_. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it usually takes 3 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.

State and local public health officials are interviewing people about the animals they came into contact with in the week before they got sick. Of the 20 people interviewed, 11 (55%) reported contact with a pet bearded dragon before getting sick.

Laboratory and Traceback Data
-----------------------------
Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of these outbreaks. CDC PulseNet manages a national database of DNA fingerprints of bacteria that cause gastrointestinal illnesses. DNA fingerprinting is performed on bacteria using a method called whole genome sequencing (WGS).

WGS showed that bacteria from sick people's samples are closely related genetically. This means that people in each outbreak likely got sick from the same type of animal.

_Salmonella_ Vitkin outbreak:
Among the 6 people who reported contact with bearded dragons, 4 reported purchasing their bearded dragon from different pet stores. Investigators are working to determine if there is a common supplier of bearded dragons.

_Salmonella_ IIIb 61:z52:z53 outbreak:
Utah public health officials identified the outbreak strain from samples collected from a sick person's bearded dragon and its habitat.

Among the 5 people who reported contact with bearded dragons, all reported purchasing or having contact with bearded dragons from different pet stores. Investigators are working to determine if there is a common supplier of bearded dragons.

WGS of bacteria from 22 people's samples, 4 bearded dragon samples, and one sample from a bearded dragon's habitat predicted resistance to ciprofloxacin; analysis of bacteria from 1 person's sample did not predict resistance to any antibacterials. Most people with _Salmonella_ illness recover without specific therapy. However, if antimicrobials are needed, this resistance could affect the choice of therapy used to treat some people. Standard antibacterial susceptibility testing by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory is currently underway.

Public Health Actions
---------------------
CDC is working with the bearded dragon industry and the pet industry to reduce _Salmonella_ in bearded dragons. CDC advises that you always take steps to stay healthy around your pet bearded dragon:
- Wash your hands.
- Don't kiss or snuggle your bearded dragon.
- Keep your bearded dragon out of the kitchen and away from areas where young children play.
- Keep its supplies and habitat clean.
- Limit young children's contact with your bearded dragon.

[Molecular methods have shown that the genus _Salmonella_ consists of only 2 species. The following nomenclature (https://www.pasteur.fr/sites/default/files/veng_0.pdf) is in accordance with present taxonomic knowledge. The 2 species in the genus _Salmonella_ are _S. enterica_ and _S. bongori_. _Salmonella enterica_ is divided into the following 6 subspecies : _S. enterica_ subsp. enterica_, _S. enterica_ subsp. _salamae_, _S. enterica_ subsp. _arizonae_, _S. enterica_ subsp. _diarizonae_, _S. enterica_ subsp. _houtenae_ and _S. enterica_ subsp. _indica_. These species and subspecies can be distinguished on the basis of differential characters.

Before the taxonomy of the genus _Salmonella_ was established on a scientific basis, _S. enterica_ subspecies were considered as subgenera and serovars were treated as species. Thus, there were subgenera I (subsp. _enterica_), II (subsp. _salamae_), III (former genus _Arizona_ ; subdivided in IIIa, subsp. _arizonae_, and IIIb, subsp. _diarizonae_), IV (subsp. _houtenae_), V (S. bongori), and VI (subsp. _indica_).

_S._ Vitkin is a serotype of _S enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ (based on its O (somatic) and H (flagellar) antigens. _Salmonella_ IIIb 61:z52:z53 [the O antigen:the H antigens] is an unnamed serotype of _S enterica_ subspecies _diarizonae_.

Salmonellosis can be acquired from a variety of lizards, including these bearded dragons, snakes, turtles, and iguanas. Appropriate hand hygiene is necessary to minimize this risk.

_Pogona_ (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogona) is a genus of reptiles containing 8 species, which are often known by the common name bearded dragons. The term "bearded dragon" is most commonly used to describe the central bearded dragon, (_Pogona vitticeps_). Members of this genus live in the arid, rocky, semi-desert regions, and dry open woodlands of Australia. They are adept climbers, spending time on branches and in bushes and near human habitation.

_Pogona_ species bask on rocks and exposed branches in the mornings and afternoons. They are found throughout Australia. Several species of this genus, especially the central bearded dragon, are often kept as pets or exhibited in zoos due to their hardy nature and easy care in comparison to other exotic reptiles.
