According to a study today in the Annals of Internal Medicine, fractional dosing of the yellow fever vaccine offers recipients protective antibodies for up to 10 years without a booster dose.

The results could inform the use of fractional dosing in preventive vaccination campaigns, and not just outbreak settings. In related news, Nigeria is vaccinating millions of people after 9 people recently tested positive, and Dutch officials report an imported yellow fever case.

The randomized, controlled trial was conducted from 2005 - 2007 at Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands and included 75 participants who provided blood samples at 10 year follow-up after receiving either a 0.1-milliliter (mL) fractional dose of the vaccine intradermally or the standard 0.5-mL dose subcutaneously.

Participants who received a booster dose during the 10-year follow-up were excluded from the study. Both groups received the same vaccine, manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur.

According to the authors, 10 years after primary vaccination, 73 of 75 (97 percent; 95 percent confidence interval [CI], 92 - 99 percent) participants had seroprotective antibody levels. Sero-protection was observed in 39 of 40 (98 percent 95 percent CI, 89 - 100 percent) participants who received the intradermal fractional dose of 17D-YFV vaccine and 34 of 35 (97 percent; 95 percent CI, 87 -100 percent) who received the subcutaneous standard dose.

Though the fractional dose (one-5th) of 17D-YFV vaccine has been proven noninferior to full doses in previous studies, this is the 1st study to establish long-term immunity. Previously, the authors of this study showed that recipients of the fractional dose displayed a protective antibody response in healthy adults one year after primary vaccination.

"Our most important finding was that 97 percent of participants had seroprotective levels of yellow fever-neutralizing antibodies 10 years after primary vaccination with a one-5th dose of 17D-YFV vaccine," the authors concluded.

Fractional dosing has been used in recent years in outbreaks in Brazil and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) as a way to stretch the global stockpile of the yellow fever vaccine.

In 2006, the World Health Organization (WHO) began the Yellow Fever Initiative, which entailed preventive mass vaccination campaigns in western Africa and ensured an emergency stockpile of vaccines. But because production of the yellow fever vaccine takes 12 months and uses pathogen-free embryonated eggs, production is difficult during a substantial outbreak.

Lead author of the study Anna Roukens, MD, PhD, from the Leiden University Medical Center said the study was encouraging news for the global stockpile of vaccine.

"If the minimum dose is guaranteed by the manufacturer, there is no reason why the standard dose could not be changed to this effective fractional dose, even in routine vaccinations," Roukens told CIDRAP News.

In related developments, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) confirmed more cases in an ongoing outbreak in Edo state. As of 21 Nov [2018], 9 people have tested positive for the virus.

Since September 2017, 140 people in Nigeria have tested positive for the virus. Last week, ProMED-mail, an infectious disease message board, said 2 people in Edo likely died from yellow fever.

Nigeria is in the midst of the 2nd phase of the largest yellow fever vaccination campaign ever, which aims to reach 26.2 million people to establish a high level of immunity in that country.

"The vaccination will be for people within the 9 months to 44 years cohort; parents are advised to avail themselves and their children to partake in the vaccination; the vaccine is free, safe and effective," said Joseph Oteri, MD, the director of special duties at Nigeria's National Primary Health Care Development Agency.

The campaign will go through 1 Dec [2018]. It is funded by Nigeria, the WHO, and GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance.

"Nigeria is on the front line in the global battle against yellow fever," said Seth Berkley, MD, Gavi CEO. "Routine immunisation coverage remains dangerously low, as shown by the latest outbreak, which is why this campaign is so important to protect the vulnerable. While this campaign will save lives, we need to focus our efforts on the best long-term solution, improving routine immunisation coverage so every child is protected, preventing outbreaks from happening in the 1st place."

In addition to cases in Nigeria, ProMED-mail notes that a Dutch man has yellow fever after traveling to Gambia and Senegal. He was not vaccinated against the virus and is showing signs of liver failure.

[There has been considerable interest in the duration of immunity elicited by the fractional administration of yellow fever vaccine. Previous reports indicated 1-8 years of immunity, but this is the 1st documentation of 10-year immunity. Since YF vaccine is live attenuated, one wonders -- since active virus replication occurs -- whether protective immunity may persist longer than 10 years. The effectiveness of the fractionated dose is indeed good news for extending the potential coverage of available stockpiles.
