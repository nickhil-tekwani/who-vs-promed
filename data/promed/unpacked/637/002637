[Normally, ProMED-mail reports occurrence of cases and outbreaks, rather than an assessment of risk of future infections. However, this report and its comments are very timely, given the recent cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) and future risks of infection in this CCHF endemic area. - Mod.TY]

Abstract
--------
"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is endemic in Eurasian countries such as Turkey, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran. CCHF virus is spread by the hyalomma tick, which is found mainly on cattle and sheep. Muslim countries, in which these animals are sacrificed during Eid-Al-Adha [22-23 Sep 2015], are among the countries where CCHF is endemic, and it has been observed that CCHF is associated with practices surrounding the Eid-ad-Adha festival. The dates for Eid-Al-Adha drift 10 days earlier in each year according to Georgian calendar. In previous years Eid-al-Adha occurred in autumn-winter months however in the next 10-15 years it will be take place in the summer months when CCHF is more prevalent. This may lead to a rise in the number of cases due to increased dissemination of CCHF virus with uncontrolled animal movements in and between countries. This consensus report focuses on the variable practices regarding animal handling in different regions and possible preventative measures to reduce the incidence of CCHF. Environmental hygiene and personal protection are essential parts of prevention. There is a need for international collaborative preparedness and response plans for prevention and management of CCHF during Eid-Al-Adha in countries where the disease is prevalent.

Introduction
------------
"Eid-al-Adha (the Muslim Festival of Sacrifice) occurs annually during the Hajj (annual pilgrimage to Mecca) and is an important Eid celebration for Muslims around the world. Animal sacrifices are performed during this festival in recognition of the willingness of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) to sacrifice his son Ismail [Isaac] for God's sake. Those who do not attend Hajj also sacrifice animals in their own countries. During these festivals, Muslims sacrifice animals such as cattle, sheep, goat, or share a camel. Generally, Muslims slaughter animals by themselves, but a person who is not able to do so can appoint someone else to undertake the slaughter on their behalf.

"The dates in the Islamic Calendar for Eid-Al-Adha are drifting 10 days earlier each year according to Georgian calendar. In the past Eid-al-Adha has occurred in the autumn-winter months but in the next 10-15 years, the festival will occur in summer months when Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is more prevalent. This may cause increased number of cases with CCHF, due to inadequate knowledge about the disease, careless practices of slaughtering animals, and dissemination of CCHF virus (CCHFV) through uncontrolled animal movements in and between countries.

Conclusion
----------
"This review emphasizes potential risk factors responsible for CCHFV transmission from animals during slaughter associated with Eid-al-Adha in Muslim countries. It identifies the traditional celebrations and/or behaviors associated with Eid-al-Adha; starting from purchasing of sacrificial animals to slaughtering practices that play an important role for virus transmission.

"In developing countries, the control of zoonotic diseases is generally managed by vertical programs, under different sections or ministries. To make preparedness and response plans for Eid-Al-Adha in Muslim countries at risk of CCHF, coordination and closer integration between ministries of health, agriculture, veterinary, and working with intergovernmental organizations such as Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), World Health Organization (WHO), and World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) should be established. This One Health approach is pivotal for implementing these policies for effective surveillance, control and management of CCHF with encouraging and fostering collaboration among veterinary researchers, infectious disease physicians, microbiologists, public health researchers, and ecologists. Also funding agencies should support knowledge translation from developed countries to resource-limited countries."

[ProMED-mail thanks Prof Leblebicoglu for calling the report above to our attention. He commented, "I read the recent post to PROMED regarding CCHF due to animal handling with great interest. It is a great problem in Pakistan and possibly will cause problems in Turkey and other countries in the next years because it will be take place in the summer months when CCHF is more prevalent. This may lead to a rise in the number of cases due to increased dissemination of CCHF virus with uncontrolled animal movements in and between countries."

The compelling case for a One Health approach advocated in the report above, with interdisciplinary participation, will be essential in the public education program, as well as planning and execution of field practices and preparation for treatment of CCHF cases by health care workers. Religious leaders could play an important role in public education in support of preventive measures.
