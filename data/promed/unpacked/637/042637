A new haplotype of '_Candidatus_ Liberibacter solanacearum' [Lso; EPPO A1 quarantine list] (haplotype U) has been described from Finland. It was found in the psyllid, _Trioza urticae_, and its host plant, _Urticae dioica_ (stinging nettle; Urticaceae). This is the first report of Lso in a plant that belongs to neither Solanaceae nor Apiaceae. It is not known if this haplotype poses a risk to crops in Europe (Haapalainen et al. Phytopathology 2018; 108: 925-934. https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/10.1094/PHYTO-12-17-0410-R).

An unknown haplotype of Lso was also detected in a single specimen of _Trioza urticae_ from a suction trap in Germany (Sjolund et al. J Plant Diseases & Protection 2019; 126: 89-92. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs41348-018-0187-z).

A new haplotype of Lso (haplotype F) has been described from the USA in potato (_Solanum tuberosum_). Up to now only haplotypes A and B were found in potato in the USA. This is the 7th haplotype described (Swisher Grimm & Garczynski. Plant Disease 2019, early view: https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/10.1094/PDIS-06-18-0937-RE).

[Only a few members of _Candidatus_ Liberibacter have been characterised so far, including the pathogens causing citrus greening (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives) which is limited to these crops due to the host specificity of the psyllid vectors.

_Ca._ Liberibacter solanacearum (Lso) was found to be associated with zebra chip (ZC) of potato, as well as a yellowing disease of tomato and capsicum in New Zealand. Lso has since also been associated with yellowing diseases of other solanaceous crops and some crops in the family Apiaceae. Main vectors of Lso are the potato psyllid (_Bactericera cockerelli_) in solanaceous host and carrot psyllids (_Trioza apicalis_, _Bactericera trigonica_) in Apiaceae. These vectors have a much wider host range than the greening vectors and additional vector species are also being identified, further extending potential host range and economic impact of Lso.

The Lso species is divided into haplotypes: A and B affecting Solanaceae; C, D and E affecting Apiaceae. Both groups of haplotypes have been reported from the Americas and New Zealand. Carrot haplotypes have been reported from Europe (ProMED-mail posts 20120713.1199961, 20151009.3702151, 20161130.4666613), northern Africa (ProMED-mail post 20141121.2978030) and the Middle East (ProMED-mail post 20170130.4803773). Potato haplotypes A & B are still considered absent from the European/Mediterranean region. However, haplotype E was recently also detected in potatoes in Spain [ProMED-mail post 20170802.5222241], representing the 1st report of a haplotype being able to infect both Apiaceae and Solanaceae.

The reports of additional haplotypes, hosts and vector species above further add to the complexity of the epidemiology and biology of this species. A lot more research is needed on Lso, its global distribution and any potential biosecurity implications.
