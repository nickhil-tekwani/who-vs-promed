On a sunny mid-September morning, men and women in white lab coats and dark business suits gathered before a phalanx of television cameras near San Diego Bay to address the nation's largest hepatitis A outbreak in decades. Though the public health crisis had been identified more than 6 months earlier, it was the 1st time that medical and elected leaders stood together in public, symbolically taking joint responsibility for a viral scourge that took root among the region's homeless residents.

The results were nearly instantaneous. A week prior to that day, [Tue 19 Sep 2017], the county had vaccinated 27 307 people against hepatitis A since the outbreak had been identified in March 2017. A week after, the vaccination total shot past 52 000. It took half a year to inoculate 27 000, but only 2 weeks to nearly double that total.

Given that just a single dose of the hepatitis A vaccine is 90 percent effective at preventing infection, this sudden vaccination acceleration was a key result of the complex public health campaign against a virus that killed 20 people and infected 578 throughout San Diego County. Now, more than 120 000 vaccinations have been administered, and no new case of outbreak-related hepatitis A has been detected since [Wed 3 Jan 2018].

There's no denying that vaccination uptake increased significantly after local leadership started speaking in a unified and direct manner to the public about the severity of the problem. However, those who were most directly involved say getting control of hepatitis A took much, much more than the words of leaders standing in front of the country administration building. In addition to public health officer Dr. Wilma Wooten's declaration of a public health emergency on [Fri 1 Sep 2018], there were a broad range of specific actions taken. They included installing hand-washing stations and portable toilets in locations where the homeless congregate and regularly washing city sidewalks with a bleach solution to help make conditions more sanitary for those living on the streets.

While it's difficult to say which of these interventions helped the most, many point to the work of hundreds of nurses, homeless outreach workers and law enforcement officers who took vaccination efforts into the canyons, back alleys, riverbeds and other out-of-the way locations far from the more-traditional soup kitchens and assistance centers where vaccination campaigns began.

Sanitation efforts were surely important, said Fran Butler-Cohen, chief executive of Family Health Centers of San Diego, the region's largest community clinic network and a major provider of the health workers who participated on mobile foot teams. But boots on the ground were necessary to truly turn the tide, she said. Persistence and existing knowledge of the homeless population counted for a lot. "We encountered homeless who truly thought this was a county conspiracy to kill them off or to get them to move and go away," Butler-Cohen said. "In many cases, we didn't start out with a lot of trust, and that's something that just had to be built over time."

Family Health Centers employees often accompanied other workers out into the field and even used gift cards, at one point, to persuade people to get vaccinated. Changing tactics as the outbreak continued, she said, was essential to making progress as summer turned to fall.

"This is not a simple population to bring any medical service to," Butler-Cohen said. "If nothing else, what we experienced with hep A is the message that you've got to try to tackle these kinds of problems in many different ways, you've got to move quickly and you've got to be able to sustain your efforts for a long time."

In a short emailed statement, San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer said he thought vaccination was the "single most effective thing we did to turn the tide during the hepatitis A crisis. We pulled out all the stops to raise public awareness about the importance of vaccinations," he said. "We offered free vaccines at libraries, had officers accompany nurses into homeless encampments, won state approval so our firefighter paramedics could administer vaccines, and conducted a media blitz to get the word out every day. Some of those things were happening before, and it's clear that the extra push that began in September [2017] made all the difference."

It's important to note, added county supervisor Ron Roberts that the all-hands-on-deck effort that coalesced in September 2017 would not have been possible without the months of behind-the-scenes meetings that occurred from March 2017 through August 2017. Mapping outbreak cases and working on vaccination and sanitation campaigns in jails and emergency rooms developed the kind of intelligence necessary to scale up into a larger effort.

"At the time that we had that press conference in September [2017] we had already done 400-plus field events," Roberts said. "By then, we had a much better understanding of what we were dealing with in every respect."

As the outbreak continued to grow, some criticized local leadership for not moving with enough urgency though it's clear, looking at a timeline of events, that much work started immediately in March 2017. What's also clear is that most of that work was not very visible to the public. A series of regular press statements and regular weekly updates of death and case totals did not really catch fire until numbers grew eye-poppingly large.

Would it have been better to come out to the public and call the outbreak an emergency earlier on?

That's a tricky question. Dr. Eric McDonald, chief of the country's Epidemiology and Immunization Services Branch, said there was a significant concern right from the beginning that making a call for vaccination too broadly could quickly burn through available vaccine supplies, which were already strained by several hepatitis A outbreaks in other cities. The fact is, McDonald said, most people not in or directly serving the homeless and drug users who were most often getting sick, really didn't need to be vaccinated because hepatitis A is spread through fecal contamination. For most people, ingesting the feces of an infected person, even a very small amount, was just not likely unless they were in regular and close contact with the homeless and/or drug-using population.

Making too broad-based a vaccination push, McDonald said, could have backfired by funneling vaccine doses to low-risk residents at the expense of those who needed it most. "There is a balance between making sure the right people get the vaccine and that there is enough public awareness that people understand what's going on and take action," McDonald said.

Roberts added that when it was decided to be more public with the vaccination effort, it became clear that some people who really didn't need to get the shot would do so out of fear. For this reason, Roberts said, he didn't roll up his own sleeve. "I knew that I personally was not really in one of the high-risk groups, and I thought the vaccine needed to be focused on the people who needed it the most," Roberts said. "I know a lot of people who shared with me that they got vaccinated and sometimes, privately, I thought 'well, that was probably a waste.'"

As the outbreak grew in size, and as the strains of the hepatitis A virus that caused San Diego's outbreak began to pop up in other places, from Santa Cruz County and Los Angeles to Utah and Kentucky, the public health world began to take notice.

Dr. Jesse Jacob, an infectious diseases specialist and hospital epidemiologist at Emory University Hospital Midtown in Atlanta, said the amount of time it took for San Diego to get its outbreak under control was within normal expectations. Local efforts, especially the use of foot teams that drew in law enforcement as well as outreach workers and nurses, she said, were particularly noteworthy. "I don't think that particular approach has been done before," he said.

Though she declined to grant an interview on the subject, Dr. Monique Foster, a medical director with the CDC, said in an email that San Diego "deployed novel strategies and tactics for vaccination of a hard-to-reach population."

"Some of these strategies and tactics could be replicated by other state health departments dealing with a hepatitis A outbreak among populations similar to the outbreak in San Diego," Foster added. She particularly cited partnerships with community groups who work day in and day out with the homeless, saying they "can go a long way in increasing the uptake of vaccinations."

McDonald said that going forward the county plans to continue focused vaccination work in county jails, behavioral health facilities and other places where people who are at greatest risk reside or receive services. He noted that there is still a lot of fundamental work to be done getting people vaccinated for hepatitis A who would have been recommended to receive the shot because of their other medical conditions, such as chronic liver disease, even if the outbreak had never happened. For example, he said, 308 of the 578 outbreak cases had conditions that meant they should have been vaccinated long before the outbreak happened.

[The public health community in San Diego should be lauded for their efforts in stepping outside the box to control this large outbreak of hepatitis A utilizing a change in the standard paradigm of hepatitis A control in the developed world. Additionally, the media should be commended in reporting the outbreak in intelligent and useful ways particularly Mr. Sisson, the author of this piece. - Mod.LL]

On [Tue 23 Jan 2018], the County ended the local health emergency, declared on [Fri 1 Sep 2017], in response to the local hepatitis A outbreak. The action does not mean the outbreak is over, and the County will continue efforts it has taken to control the spread of the disease. The outbreak is being spread person-to-person and through contact with fecally contaminated environments. The majority of people who have contracted hepatitis A during this outbreak have been homeless and/or illicit drug users.

Efforts of the County and its community partners to halt the hepatitis A outbreak focus on 3 key areas: vaccination, sanitation and education

Since [Sun 1 Jan 2017], Utah public health has identified 193 confirmed cases of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection; many among persons who are homeless and/or using illicit drugs. Several cases have been linked by investigation and/or viral sequencing to a national outbreak of hepatitis A involving cases in California and Arizona. Hospitalization rates of less than 40 percent have been described in previous hepatitis A outbreaks; however, other jurisdictions associated with this outbreak are reporting case hospitalization rates approaching 70 percent. The high rate of hospitalization may be a result of cases having underlying illnesses (e.g., alcoholism), or a higher rate of hepatitis comorbidities (e.g., hepatitis B or C). In response to the outbreak, public health officials have been working to identify cases and contacts, provide education, and ensure opportunities for vaccination of close contacts to cases and vulnerable populations.

Hepatitis A is usually spread through having oral contact with items contaminated with hepatitis A, for example, through ingesting food or drinks contaminated by infected feces. Some people do not develop symptoms, even if infected. If symptoms occur, they usually appear anywhere from 2-6 weeks after exposure. Symptoms usually develop over a period of several days, and may include jaundice (the yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes), abdominal pain, nausea or diarrhea. Hepatitis A vaccination is the best way to prevent hepatitis A infection.

Public health officials and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) are continuing to see an elevated number of hepatitis A cases in the state.

Since the beginning of the outbreak in August 2016, public health response has included increased healthcare awareness efforts, public notification and education, and outreach with vaccination clinics for high-risk populations. No common sources of food, beverages, or drugs have been identified as a potential source of infection. Transmission appears to be through direct person-to-person spread and illicit drug use. Those with history of injection and non-injection drug use, homelessness or transient housing, and incarceration are thought to be at greater risk in this outbreak setting. Notably, this outbreak has had a high hospitalization rate.
