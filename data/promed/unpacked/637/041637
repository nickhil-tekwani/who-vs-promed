Australia (NSW): City and State-wide Viral Gastroenteritis Outbreak
---------------------------------------------------
The city of Dubbo is in the grip of a gastroenteritis epidemic, with
almost 300 cases of super-contagious "gastric flu" reported to health
services in the last 2 weeks. The outbreak has hammered Dubbo Base
Hospital, contributing to its busiest period in 5 years, while some
aged-care facilities have banned visitors for fear of importing the
virus.

The highly contagious virus is believed to be the same rampant strain
of viral gastroenteritis that temporarily shut down Lithgow and
Molong hospitals. The main symptoms of the virus are watery diarrhoea
and vomiting; other symptoms may include nausea, fever, abdominal
pain, headache and muscle aches.

The level of concern about the contagion has been underlined by a
public health warning issued by Macquarie Area Health Service (MAHS).
The MAHS Centre for Population Health has urged people who have had
the illness to avoid work, child-care centres and aged care
facilities to halt its spread. People who fall ill with the virus
should try to quarantine themselves for 2 days after recovering,
according to MAHS director of population health Dr Tony Brown.

He said the virus [infection] -- often referred to as the "gastric
flu" -- is very contagious from person-to-person and was not related
to food consumption. "The message we want to reinforce is there is a
lot of it in the community, most people who get it will get better
quickly without too much problem provided they keep their fluids up,
but let's not spread it around," he said. "If someone in the family
gets it we are advising people to take extra care with hygiene,
washing hands regularly and being especially careful preparing food."

The virus striking Dubbo has been working its way through the State
and is more likely to hit communal facilities, Dr Brown said. "The
regional outbreak is believed to be part of a wider epidemic striking
many areas of NSW -- including the Sydney area -- with symptoms of
severe vomiting and diarrhoea," he explained. "The number of viral
gastroenteritis cases usually increase in winter and are common
within families and group settings including nursing homes,
hospitals, residential care, child-care centres and schools."

Australia (NSW): Public Health Warning Issued for Macquarie Area
-------------------------------------------------
An epidemic of viral gastroenteritis sweeping the region since the
beginning of May 2004 has prompted Macquarie Area Health Service
(MAHS) to issue a public health warning. MAHS Centre for Population
Health has been notified of almost 300 cases since 7 May 2004, with
Dubbo, Nyngan and Mudgee hardest hit. Dubbo Base Hospital management
reported the facility's busiest day in at least 5 years on Thu and
Fri 13 and 14 May 2004.

Aged care facilities in the region have been particularly prone to
the virus, which is believed to be the same virus that caused the
temporary closure of hospitals in Lithgow and Molong in Mid-West Area
Health Service.

MAHS Centre for Population Health has urged people who have had the
illness to avoid work, child care centres and aged care facilities to
halt the spread. The virus is very contagious person-to-person, is
often referred to as "gastric flu" and is not related to food
contamination, according to MAHS Director of Population Health, Dr
Tony Brown.

The regional outbreak is believed to be part of a wider epidemic
striking many areas of NSW including the Sydney area with symptoms of
severe vomiting and diarrhoea. The number of viral gastroenteritis
cases usually increase in winter and are common within families and
group settings including nursing homes, hospitals, residential care,
childcare centres and schools."

Viral gastroenteritis is a common infection of the gut. The main
symptoms of viral gastroenteritis are watery diarrhoea and vomiting.
Other symptoms may include nausea, fever, abdominal pain, headache
and muscle aches. Dehydration can follow. Symptoms can take between
one and 3 days to develop and usually last between one and 2 days,
sometimes longer. The illness is highly infectious and is spread by
the vomit or faeces from an infected person by person-to-person
contact, for example shaking hands with someone who has been sick and
has the virus on their hands. It can also be transmitted through
contaminated, food or drink and even through contaminated surfaces.
Infection can occur possibly through the air when people vomit. In
most cases, because the illness is viral the spread occurs from a
person who has symptoms. Some people can still pass on the infection
without symptoms, particularly in the first 48 hours after recovery.
The infection can be prevented by washing your hands thoroughly with
soap and running water for at least 15 seconds and dry them with a
clean towel after using the toilet, changing nappies [diapers] and
before eating or preparing food.

There is no specific treatment for viral gastroenteritis except rest
and drinking plenty of fluids. Most people will recover without any
complications. However it can be serious for those who may have
difficulty replacing fluids lost through vomiting and diarrhoea.

New Zealand: Norovirus Outbreaks Affects Wellington
--------------------------------------------------
A virus running rampant in the community over recent weeks has now
infected Newtown and Kenepuru hospitals. By Friday 28 May 2004,
norovirus infection had affected 40 people at these hospitals, giving
them vomiting and diarrhoea, infectious diseases physician Doctor Tim
Blackmore stated. "For most people it will be a 24-hour bug, however,
it can be quite debilitating for the very old, the very young and
those with compromised immune systems," Dr Blackmore says.

Health board interim chief operating officer John Peters says these
hospitals have stepped up measures to control the virus by isolating
infected patients and sending home staff with any signs of infection.
"As 3/4 of the cases in our facilities have been at Kenepuru
Community Hospital, we are sending patients who require admission,
and who also have vomiting or diarrhoea, there. We are directing
other new admissions to Wellington Hospital. We have also postponed
non-urgent surgery, although day surgery is going ahead as we assess
the risk of infection for those patients to be very low."

Norovirus is a reasonably common illness, which typically affects
places where large numbers of people are in close contact, such as
schools, rest homes or cruise ships. It surfaces in the greater
Wellington region most winters.

Scotland: Concert-goers Affected by Suspected Viral Gastroenteritis
---------------------------------------------------
Public health experts today confirmed that more than 300 people have
contacted them saying they were suffering from symptoms of
gastroenteritis. The outbreak has hit fans who attended the
Charlatans concert at the Music Hall in Aberdeen on Sat 22 May 2004.

Health experts opened a phoneline asking people with symptoms to
contact them. Today they confirmed 300 people had been in touch,
saying they had the symptoms. The announcement means a sizeable
proportion of the sell-out crowd of 1200 have been struck down.
Scientists say they are closing in on the cause of a bug. The Music
Hall remained closed today while the venue was disinfected.

An NHS spokeswoman said that: "A series of tests have now been
carried out. We are expecting to have the results by Monday morning."
She declined to speculate on what the infectious agent could be -- or
how it was spread. But Dr Helen Howie, consultant in public health
medicine, said: "It may turn out to be an airborne viral infection,
which means it could spread very easily. It might have been
introduced by someone who was attending the concert."

The Music Hall was closed yesterday afternoon, and the entire
building is being cleaned with strong disinfectant under the
supervision of environmental health officers. The venue is expected
to reopen tomorrow.

[On Sat 29 May 2004 the initial tentative diagnosis of norovirus
infection was confirmed by laboratory tests. The unusual feature of
this outbreak is that approximately 300 of 1200 people attending a
2-3-hour concert in a large well-ventilated concert hall in Aberdeen
contracted norovirus infection, when there was no evidence of a
significant epidemic in the city of Aberdeen. Food/water-borne
transmission of norovirus infection can occur, shellfish being a
frequent culprit, although so far the local health authorities have
discounted this possibility. The preferred interpretation is presence
in the audience of a few norovirus-infected individuals spreading
this highly contagious virus. - Mod.CP]

Canada: Gastroenteritis Outbreak at Hotel in Yoho National Park
---------------------------------------------------
After more than 150 people reported gastrointestinal problems since
19 May 2004, federal health and parks officials are investigating a
private hotel in Yoho National Park. The investigation began after
complaints from people who had visited or worked at the Emerald Lake
Lodge about 50 kilometres west of Lake Louise on the British
Columbia-Alberta border.

The cause of the outbreak has not been determined. Officials are
working with hotel staff to identify the source of the outbreak and
to prevent further spreading of the illness. Symptoms include severe
diarrhea and vomiting lasting up to several days. It could be spread
through contaminated water or food or through environmental
contamination.

A boil water advisory is currently in effect at Emerald Lake. Health
Canada is recommending that anyone who has been to the lodge after
May 19 and has experienced symptoms see a doctor.

[Norovirus outbreaks have been associated often with vacation
activities and places such as tourist hotels, coaches and ships,
where people from diverse backgrounds congregate with one or more
individuals carrying this highly contagious virus. The circumstances
of this outbreak are compatible with norovirus infection, but a
definitive diagnosis requires confirmation by laboratory testing. -

Canada: Norovirus suspected as Cause of Outbreak at Yoho Nations Park
--------------------------------------------------
The virus that shut down a hotel in a national park in British
Columbia after almost 200 people suffered severe vomiting and
diarrhea is probably a strain of norovirus. The symptoms - a sudden
outbreak that quickly infected many people in only 4 days -- are
hallmarks of the virus, said John Blatherwick, the chief medical
officer of Vancouver Coastal Health. Guests at Emerald Lake Lodge, a
hotel in Yoho National Park, first reported health problems Tuesday.
Hotel staff also fell ill, leading its owners to ask Health Canada to
investigate. As the epidemic grew to about 150 people by Friday, the
hotel voluntarily closed.

Australia (Tasmania): Gastroenteritis Outbreak Restricts Elective Surgery
---------------------------------------------------
Elective surgery cases will be affected from today after the Royal
Hobart Hospital (RHH) created a gastroenteritis isolation ward. 14
patients have been admitted and staff sick leave has increased due
the viral gastroenteritis outbreak, says RHH chief executive officer
Ted Rayment. "Because of the highly contagious nature of the disease,
one ward of the hospital has been declared an isolation ward to
handle the gastroenteritis admissions. Because we have isolated one
full ward from the normal operation of the hospital, we need to
postpone some elective surgery cases from tomorrow," Mr Rayment said
yesterday.

He said people could help by notifying their general practitioner
(GP) rather than visiting the Department of Emergency Medicine.
"Obviously, if their symptoms are severe, they should present at
emergency in the usual way. If they're unsure, they should contact
their GP or phone the hospital first," Mr Rayment said.

The community-caught virus is suspected to be a strain of norovirus,
a virus which caused major problems at the hospital in November 2003.
The Public and Environmental Health Service advises that symptoms of
viral gastroenteritis include diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, nausea and
vomiting and low-grade fever. The illness usually lasts 48 hours
after a 24-48 hour incubation period, and those affected can spread
infection for another 48 hours after symptoms disappear. It is often
transmitted between people and sometimes by eating or drinking
contaminated food or water.
