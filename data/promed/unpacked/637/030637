The Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod) is to rehabilitate a total of 10 000 hectares [24 700 acres] of diseased and overage cocoa farms [which] will involve the removal of 11 million trees for replanting. Currently, about 17 per cent of cocoa area surveyed, about 309 831 hectares [765 600], is affected by the cocoa swollen shoot virus disease (CSSVD) while about 23 per cent is more than 30 years and unproductive.

Cocoa Health and Extension Division (CHED) said they would commence another survey to update CSSVD areas in all 60 CHED districts. Cocobod would continue control programmes through the removal of diseased trees and replanting of unproductive farms country-wide. [They] would provide hybrid cocoa seedlings which are early-bearing, high-yielding and disease tolerant, and render effective extension services.

[Swollen shoot disease of cocoa is caused by _Cacao swollen shoot virus_ (CSSV; genus _Badnavirus_) and can lead to severe crop losses. CSSV is thought to have been transferred to cocoa from West African forest trees. Symptoms vary with different viral strains, from severe effects on shoots and roots resulting in serious dieback or even death of the tree, to no symptoms at all. The virus is spread by several species of mealybugs (_Pseudococcidae_) and may also be transmitted by grafting and mechanical inoculation. Seed transmission is also suspected.

Disease management relies on phytosanitation and clean planting material. Most affected countries require the removal of all infected trees and their neighbours. Mealybugs are difficult to control, and native forests serve as pathogen reservoirs. Keeping replanted trees from becoming reinfected would be challenging under local conditions, thus ongoing breeding programmes for virus- or vector-resistant crop varieties are crucial. Cross protection against severe viral strains by mild CSSV strains is also being trialled (see link below).

A westward spread of CSSV in Ghana led to a serious outbreak in 2008 (ProMED-mail post 20081030.3416) with the possibility of the involvement of a new viral strain. Ghana, Togo, Nigeria, and CÃ´te d'Ivoire have signed an agreement to tackle the disease.
