-----------------------------------------------
Is there any chance that this apparent oncovirus is transmitted on poorly
sanitized live-traps?
According to Animal Planet, there is a vigorous live-trapping program in
Tasmania that catches individual [Tasmanian] devils several times a year
for reproductive monitoring. As devils are intemperate by nature and tend
to chew on the metal bars of their enclosure, trauma from escape attempts
would seem a logical avenue to exposure to a virus of this type.
