It is only early spring and already, Christus St. Patrick Hospital infectious disease physician, Dr. Tim Haman, says 1 case each of infection with _Vibrio vulnificus_, a cause of flesh-eating bacterial disease [necrotizing fasciitis - Mod.LL], and _Mycobacterium marinum_ [a more indolent skin infection caused by a tuberculosis-related organism that does not transmit from person to person - Mod.LL] have sickened people from exposure to salty-brackish waters of Southwest Louisiana.

"As the temperatures warm up, the water warms up, people are wanting to get more out on the water and fish," said Dr. Haman. "During the winter it's very slow. The other issue is that as the water warms up, the bacterial growth increases in the water as well."

The more serious infection, _Vibrio vulnificus_, comes on very quickly after punctured skin comes in contact with this bacterium. "Cuts or abrasions or they may get a puncture wound while in the water, stepping on an oyster shell or something like that, and it causes pain and swelling in the involved extremity, but it spreads very fast," said Dr. Haman. The spread happens in 4 to 6 hours and includes redness, swelling, and high fever. Antimicrobials are needed and dead tissue must be removed.

Skin infections with _Mycobacterium marinum_ are much slower growing than _Vibrio_. "It typically causes skin and soft tissue infections," said Dr. Haman. "We see it a lot in instances where people are fishing or they're handling seafood that's raw and then end up getting a puncture wound and it introduces the bacterium into the tissue where it can cause a pretty significant infection."

Preventing these waterborne infections starts with careful handling of fishing hooks and protective gear in area waterways. If you do break the skin, clean it immediately with a diluted bleach mixture. If you are out on the waters and notice that you have any sort of swelling near a puncture wound, it is important to get immediate medical attention.

[The end of March is quite early for cases of _V. vulnificus_ to be reported in the continental USA.

The following is extracted from the "Bad Bug Book," Center for Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM297627.pdf#page46:

"_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.

"Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis."

The "primary septicemia" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70 percent of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions (shown at http://safeoysters.org/medical/diagnosis.html).

There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination) and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can involve more northern geographical areas if the area is affected by a substantial heat wave.

The following has been mostly extracted from moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail post Mycobacterium marinum, fish tank - USA: (CA) 20110704.2026, where references in the medical literature are available:

_Mycobacterium marinum_ is one of the non-tuberculous mycobacteria or NTM (that is, a grouping outside of the _M. tuberculosis_ complex). NTM are characterized by their rate of growth in vitro and pigment production. Organisms in the _Mycobacterium chelonae-abscessus_ group are non-pigmented and rapidly growing (RGM) NTM species, that is, produce mature growth on agar plates within 7 days of incubation.

_M. marinum_ infection occurs following skin and soft-tissue injuries that are exposed to an aquatic environment or fish. First described as "swimming-pool granuloma", when swimming pools were not routinely chlorinated, _M. marinum_ skin infections are now most often acquired from aquarium maintenance and called "fish tank granuloma". The infection usually presents as indolent, localized nodular or ulcerating skin lesions on mainly the upper limb of otherwise healthy people, but can evolve into an ascending lymphangitis that resembles sporotrichosis or can spread to deeper tissues, resulting in tenosynovitis, arthritis, and osteomyelitis. - Mod.LL
