A 6th person in China has become infected with the potentially fatal avian
influenza virus, the Ministry of Health said on Thu 15 Dec 2005. The latest
victim is a 35 year old man in Suichuan County of Jiangxi Province, east
China, the official Xinhua news agency reported.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) said it was aware of the case. "He is
apparently in critical condition in hospital," WHO spokeswoman Maria Cheng
said. "Our office in Beijing was informed of this today. It is in a
province that hasn't identified human cases before but it is somebody who
seems to have a history of exposure to poultry," Cheng added from the WHO's
Geneva headquarters.

The H5N1 avian influenza virus is endemic in poultry in parts of Asia and
has killed 71 people in the region out of a total of 138 known human cases
since late 2003. H5N1 remains hard for humans to catch, but there are fears
it could mutate into a form that could pass easily from person, sparking an
influenza pandemic in which millions could die.

Xinhua said the patient fell ill on 4 Dec 2005, with fever and symptoms of
pneumonia. It described him as a peddler.

Earlier on Thursday, the Ministry of Agriculture said a new avian influenza
case [a 7th case?] had been confirmed in the patient's village following
the death of 1640 ducks raised by a fellow villager. The provincial
veterinary department suspected H5N1 was the [poultry?] killer, and a state
avian flu laboratory confirmed the suspicion on Thursday, the ministry
said. Veterinary authorities in Jiangxi culled 15 000 poultry within 3km (2
miles) of the affected area as soon as the outbreak was reported.

China, the world's most populous nation, had reported 5 other cases of H5N1
among humans, including the deaths of 2 women poultry workers in the
eastern province of Anhui in November 2005.

Beijing has pledged openness in fighting bird flu after it was widely
criticised for its cover-up of the SARS virus in 2003, but Health Minister
Gao Qiang has said rural doctors might be ill-equipped or ill-trained to
detect cases. China has announced plans to vaccinate billions of birds to
contain the virus and has launched a campaign to encourage farmers and
local officials to report new cases.

China: avian influenza situation - WHO update: 49
-------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in China has confirmed an additional case of human
infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The case is a 35 year old
man from the south eastern province of Jiangxi. He developed symptoms of
fever on 4 Dec 2005 followed by pneumonia. He remains hospitalized and is
receiving intensive care.

Agricultural authorities have confirmed the presence of the H5 virus
subtype in ducks in the vicinity of the patient's residence. Family members
and close contacts have been placed under medical observation.

This is China's 6th laboratory confirmed human case. Of these cases, 2 have
been fatal. To date, China has reported human cases in 5 provinces and
regions: Hunan, Anhui (2 cases), Guangxi, Liaoning, and Jiangxi.

Local tests have confirmed that a 36 year old man who died 2 days ago in a
Jakarta hospital had avian influenza, senior health officials said today
[Fri 16 Dec 2005].

Health officials are still waiting for the results to be confirmed by a
World Health Organization (WHO) laboratory, but if the man, who lived in
South Jakarta, is confirmed to have died from avian influenza, he would be
the 10th fatality in Indonesia from the virus.

"It is positive, but we're still waiting for confirmation from the WHO lab
in Hong Kong," Indonesia's health ministry spokesman Haryadi, who only goes
by one name, told Deutsche Presse-Agentur. "Investigation of the history of
the man's contacts with chickens is ongoing."

The patient died 3 days after he was admitted to the Sulianti Saroso
infectious disease hospital in Jakarta with symptoms of H5N1 virus
infection. Positive test results by local laboratories in Indonesia are
usually confirmed by WHO, but the UN agency does not recognize cases until
they are confirmed in one of its accredited laboratories in Hong Kong.

Almost all of the human fatalities from the H5N1 virus have been contracted
from poultry so far, but experts worried it could mutate into a more deadly
virus that could spread from person to person and potentially kill millions
of people around the world.

"It is impossible to predict how lethal the pandemic strain might be," said
a WHO bird-flu handbook released on Fri 16 Dec 2005. "Modelling research
using today's global population has projected that a minimum estimate of
between 2 [million] and 7.4 million people might die."

Bird flu has spread to at least 23 of Indonesia's 33 provinces since late
2003, killing more than 9.5 million poultry, and officials are now waiting
on test results to see if the virus has spread to even more provinces.

The H5N1 strain of avian influenza has claimed the lives of at least 71
people in Asia since late 2003. The countries that have reported human
cases and deaths are Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Cambodia and China.

A 3 year old Vietnamese boy who died earlier this week had a lung
infection, [and did not die as a result of] H5N1 avian influenza virus
infection as previously suspected, a doctor said on Thu 15 Dec 2005 [for
background information, see: part (3) of ProMED-mail post: Avian influenza,
human - East Asia (198): Indonesia, Viet Nam 20051214.3596].

The toddler from Hau Giang province died on Mon 12 Dec 2005 with symptoms
pointing to bird flu infection but repeated tests showed he did not have
that virus, said Cao Minh Chu, head of the Can Tho City Paediatric
Hospital's Planning Deparment.

Doctors said the country's current cold weather had caused more lung
infections and regular flu cases but treatment procedures required doctors
to report and test all flu patients for the avian influenza virus. The H5N1
virus, which has killed 71 people including 42 Vietnamese, still persists
in 15 of the country's 64 cities and provinces, the Animal Health
Department said in a report.
