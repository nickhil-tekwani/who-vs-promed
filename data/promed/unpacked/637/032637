A Kent [Washington] company is recalling trays of raw alfalfa
sprouts, the Food and Drug Administration said Thu, 3 Jun 2004.
Sprouters Northwest Inc. is recalling 2-, 3- and 5-lb institutional
trays of sprouts sent to various food institutions because they may
be linked to a recent increase in salmonellosis in Oregon and
Washington, the FDA said in a statement.
A phone call to Sprouters Northwest rang unanswered after business
hours Thu, 3 Jun 2004. It was not immediately clear which
institutions were among its customers and might have received the
sprouts.
12 cases of [_Salmonella enterica_ serotype Bovismorbificans],
possibly linked to the consumption of raw alfalfa sprouts, have been
reported, the FDA said. FDA officials said they are working with
state officials and the company to determine the cause of the
problem and steps to combat it.

[An outbreak of this _Salmonella enterica_ serotype occurred
previously with Australian sprouts in Sweden and Finland (Ponka A,
Anderson Y, Sitonen A, deJong B, et al. Salmonella in alfalfa
sprouts. Lancet 1995;345:462-3).
In Taormina PJ, Beuchat LR, Slutsker L. Infections associated with
eating seed sprouts: An international concern. Emerg Inf Dis
1999;5:626-634, the subject of enteric infections associated with
seed sprouts was reviewed.
The following is the article's abstract:
"Recent outbreaks of Salmonella and _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7
infections associated with raw seed sprouts have occurred in several
countries. Subjective evaluations indicate that pathogens can exceed
10 million per gram of sprouts produced from inoculated seeds during
sprout production without adversely affecting appearance. Treating
seeds and sprouts with chlorinated water or other disinfectants fails
to eliminate the pathogens. A comprehensive approach based on good
manufacturing practices and principles of hazard analysis and
critical control points can reduce the risk of sprout-associated
disease. Until effective measures to prevent sprout-associated
illness are identified, persons who wish to reduce their risk of
foodborne illness from raw sprouts are advised not to eat them; in
particular, persons at high risk for severe complications of
infections with _Salmonella_ or _E. coli_ O157:H7, such as the
elderly, children, and those with compromised immune systems, should
not eat raw sprouts." - Mod.LL]
