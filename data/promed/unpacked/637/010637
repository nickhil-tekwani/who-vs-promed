[1] Case update
- Fri 15 Sep 2018. Epidemiological situation report, DRC Ministry of Health [in French, machine trans., edited]
https://us13.campaign-archive.com/?u=89e5755d2cca4840b1af93176&id=88fbfda10d

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated 14 Sep 2018
- A total of 140 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, of which 109 were confirmed and 31 were probable.
- Of the 109 confirmed, 64 died and 37 are cured.
- 5 suspected cases are under investigation.
- No new confirmed cases notified.
- 1 confirmed case death in Beni.

News of the response:

Stop rumors!
- Several messages circulating on the social networks affirm that confirmed cases of Ebola have been identified in Kabalo and that 4 suspected cases would be hospitalized at the General Reference Hospital of Kalemie, in the province of Tanganyika. These rumors are entirely false. An alert in Kabalo was reported several days ago. The samples had been sent to the INRB, and the tests had proved negative.
- As a reminder, only laboratory tests carried out by the laboratory staff of the National Institute for Biomedical Research (INRB) can confirm or invalidate the presence of the virus in the blood of a sick person.

Motorized caravan
- On Sat 15 Sep 2018, the Ministry of Health organized a motorized caravan that circulated through the city of Beni to raise awareness about the Ebola virus disease (EVD). Three busy public places were selected for the stops of this 1st caravan. These included the Oicha car park, the central market, and the Kanzuli Nzuli roundabout. On Saturday [15 Sep 2018], the city vibrated to the sound of the caravan, which included a local comedian that animated the crowd. At each stop, the population was invited to ask their questions and share their concerns with the teams of experts. After this exchange session, a competition was organized to test the public's understanding of the disease. Gifts for those who answered the questions included bottles of disinfectant offered by Airtel, Save the Children handwashing kits, and polo shirts donated by UNICEF and UNFPA. The event was recorded and will be broadcast on local radio stations.

[The case numbers continue to inch up and unfortunately include a new death in this report. But the new tactics adopted by the MoH are creative and should assist in teaching the population how they can take responsibility to control infection. Making learning fun and offering rewards for getting it right is a terrific idea and an innovative approach.

Rumors spread quickly and only serve to create fear and panic. ProMED-mail will not post suspected cases without explicitly stating the cases have not been confirmed and are only reported in the media. They will be contained in a separate section so they are clearly recognizable. - Mod.LK]

-14 Sep 2018. DRC: New cases of deadly Ebola virus, as UN steps up response
United Nations [edited]
https://www.africa-newsroom.com/press/democratic-republic-of-the-congo-new-cases-of-deadly-ebola-virus-as-un-steps-up-response?lang=en

In eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the UN has stepped up community-based efforts to tackle Ebola disease, following confirmation that the virus has reached the city of Butembo, near the Ugandan border, where it has claimed 3 lives.

On Fri [14 Sep 2018], WHO (the World Health Organization) said that there were 137 confirmed and probable cases and 92 deaths in the latest outbreak in the east of the country.

UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) announced that "everything is being done" to ensure that the disease is controlled in Butembo "at this early stage." Apart from widespread insecurity, one of the biggest challenges is overcoming communities' hostility to strict health directives that go against centuries-old cultural traditions, including burial practices.

"I remember when I was going in West Africa a few years ago during the Ebola (outbreak) how dangerous it was to go to some villages," spokesperson Christophe Boulierac said. "We know, based on our experience and our work, that it should never be underestimated, this community resistance. And it's an incentive to work at a deeper level," he added. "It's an incentive to understand more accurately what people feel and why. What are the cultural beliefs?"

He added that it was important to respond on that level "using agents of change, using people who have some influence in the community."

In a bid to help protect communities, UNICEF has dispatched a team of 11 specialists in community communication, education, and psychosocial assistance, as well as water, sanitation, and hygiene. The UN agency is also working with anthropologists specializing in local cultural beliefs and practices to help overcome possible concerns.

"If we don't do that, this resistance can really increase and can really cause serious obstacles to the fight against the disease," Mr. Boulierac said. "It's about knowing the people to whom we are talking."

More than 250 community leaders have also been alerted about the outbreak in Butembo, along with religious leaders and journalists. They have been told about prevention measures and an emergency number to call to treat anyone with Ebola-like symptoms.
[...]

"Working with the communities, alerting them, informing them, and getting them to treat Ebola cases or suspected Ebola cases in the right way is the challenge," said WHO spokesperson Christian Lindmeier.

In total, more than 8900 people have been vaccinated, including more than 2000 children. Treating the sick and protecting people who have come into contact with them is complicated, because the vast Kivus area is home to more than 100 armed groups.

The last Ebola outbreak in DRC was some 2000 miles [3219 km] away, to the west, in Equateur province, which includes the Congo River. It was declared over in July after claiming 33 lives.

[2] Response: training, specialists
- Fri 14 Sep 2018. Mbandaka: Training on surveillance of viral diseases
Radio Okapi [online trans., edited]
https://www.radiookapi.net/2018/09/14/actualite/en-bref/mbandaka-formation-sur-la-surveillance-des-maladies-virales

The Equateur Provincial Ministry of Health, in partnership with the WHO and the International Medical Corps, launched on Thu 13 Sep 2018 the training of providers on the prevention and control of infections of all kinds. Particular emphasis has been placed on the Ebola virus disease (EVD) that has just raged in the town of Mbandaka and the territory of Bikoro.

The aim is to equip the focal points and other members of the health committees with epidemiological surveillance in all directions. According to the facilitator of WHO / Equateur, Dr Ruhana, this 6-day advanced training is in addition to the emergency that the providers had received for the response to the Ebola outbreak.

- Sat 15 Sep 2018. North Kivu: UNICEF deploys specialists to contain Ebola in Butembo
Radio Okapi [online trans., edited]
https://www.radiookapi.net/2018/09/15/actualite/sante/nord-kivu-lunicef-deploie-des-specialistes-pour-contenir-ebola-butembo

The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) is expanding its fight against the Ebola outbreak in the commercial town of Butembo in North Kivu, following the confirmation of new cases of Ebola in the city. In a statement issued Fri 14 Sep 2018, the UN agency is committed to deploy specialists to help contain the disease.

A total of 11 community communication, sanitation, and hygiene specialists are deployed in Butembo, says DRC UNICEF Representative Dr Gianfranco Rotigliano. For him, it is necessary "to act now so that the epidemic is mastered at an early stage," because Butembo is a city of nearly a million inhabitants and an important commercial center in the East of the DRC. There is therefore a real risk that the Ebola virus will spread rapidly in such a densely populated center, feared Dr Gianfranco Rotigliano.

According to UNICEF, planning, priority will be given to the Butembo neighborhoods where the Ebola cases come from and those who have been in contact with the confirmed cases.

UNICEF and its partners have already trained 35 psychosocial workers to help families and children affected by the disease. Since the beginning of the epidemic, UNICEF says it has worked with community leaders, youth and religious leaders to reach more than 3.3 million people with Ebola prevention and advocacy messages.

[UNICEF can contribute a lot by providing its expertise during the Ebola outbreak in working with children. The women and children are particularly affected by the outbreak. Psychosocial workers can offer support to the affected families and children, and clearly community communication, sanitation, and hygiene specialists are critical to the effort. - Mod.LK]

[3] CDC travel alert update
- Sat 15 Sep 2018. CDC: Ebola in Democratic Republic of the Congo (updated travel advice)
CDC [edited]
http://bit.ly/2nPg2yU

Key points
- There is an outbreak of Ebola in North Kivu (Kivu Nord) and Ituri provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
- The outbreak is in a part of the country identified by the US State Department as a "reconsider travel" zone because of armed group activity and major outbreaks of violence targeting civilians.
- Travelers to this area could be infected if they come into contact with an infected person's blood or body fluids.
- Travelers should seek medical care immediately if they develop symptoms of fever, headache, body aches, sore throat, diarrhea, weakness, vomiting, stomach pain, rash, or red eyes during or after travel.

What is the current situation?
An outbreak of Ebola is occurring in the North Kivu (Kivu Nord) and Ituri provinces of the DRC, including the city of Butembo. North Kivu and Ituri provinces are in the northeastern part of the DRC, approximately 780 miles [1255 km] from the outbreak that ended in July 2018. See map of Ebola-affected health zones in the DRC. The DRC Ministry of Health declared this outbreak on [Wed 1 Aug 2018]. For the latest information on this outbreak, including updates on numbers of cases and deaths, see the World Health Organization's (WHO) Ebola situation reports: Democratic Republic of the Congo.

North Kivu and Ituri provinces are among the most populated provinces in DRC and share borders with Rwanda and Uganda, with frequent cross-border movement for trade activities. The provinces have been experiencing a prolonged humanitarian crisis and deteriorating security situation, which are expected to limit public-health efforts to respond to this outbreak.

The DRC Ministry of Health, WHO, and partners are responding to this event and working to establish the full extent of this outbreak. The response includes enhanced illness surveillance and reporting, monitoring of "contacts" (people who may have been exposed to Ebola), cross-border surveillance in neighboring countries, improved laboratory capacity, and vaccination of front-line health workers and contacts.

Who is at risk?
The risk to most travelers to DRC is low. Travelers could be infected if they come into contact with infected blood or body fluids. Family and friends caring for people with Ebola, and healthcare workers who do not use correct infection-control precautions, are at highest risk.

What can travelers do to protect themselves?
There is no FDA-approved or widely available vaccine or specific treatment for Ebola, and many people who get the disease die. Therefore, it is important to take steps to prevent Ebola.

Take action to prevent infection.
- Avoid contact with other people's blood or body fluids (see the section below for special precautions if your work puts you at risk for exposure to Ebola).
- Do not handle items that may have come in contact with a person's blood or body fluids (such as clothes, bedding, needles, or medical equipment).
- Avoid contact with wild animals and bushmeat.
- Avoid participating in burial rituals that require handling a dead body.

Pay attention to your health during travel and for 21 days after you leave DRC.
- Monitor yourself for fever and other symptoms.
- Separate yourself from others and seek medical care immediately if you have been in an area where Ebola is spreading and develop fever, headache, body aches, sore throat, diarrhea, vomiting, stomach pain, rash, or red eyes.
- Before you go to a doctor's office or emergency room, tell the doctor about your recent travel and your symptoms. Advance notice will help the doctor care for you and protect other people who may be in the office or hospital.

Although the risk for Ebola is low in travelers to DRC, other infectious disease risks remain high, including the risk for malaria. Seek medical care and proper treatment if you feel ill during travel or after returning.

Register with the US Department of State.
- If you are a US citizen, enroll online in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive security updates and information about assistance in an emergency.

For more information, see WHO recommendations for international travelers related to the Ebola virus disease outbreak in the DRC.

What can travelers do to protect others when leaving DRC?
-Travelers who may have been exposed to Ebola or who become sick during travel should postpone further travel and get immediate medical attention. Any person with possible exposure or Ebola-like symptoms will not be allowed to travel unless the travel is part of an appropriate medical evacuation.

Special recommendations for healthcare workers in the outbreak area
If your work puts you at risk of exposure to Ebola, you should
- Wear protective clothing, including masks, gloves, gowns, and eye protection whenever you are working with risk of exposure to Ebola virus; and
- Discuss options for vaccination with your sponsoring organization. DRC, WHO, and other partners are offering an investigational vaccine to priority populations such as frontline health care workers. A major clinical trial conducted in Guinea in 2015 showed the vaccine to be highly protective against Ebola.

If you choose to get vaccinated against Ebola, get the vaccine before travel, if possible.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has an open-label clinical trial, entitled "Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis in Individuals at Potential Occupational Risk for Ebola Virus Exposure," or "PREPARE," to vaccinate adult volunteers (including deploying healthcare workers and other responders) against Ebola. Study sites are located at the NIH in Bethesda, MD, and Emory University in Atlanta, GA.

Practice proper infection control and sterilization measures. For more information, see "Infection Control for Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers in the African Health Care Setting."
