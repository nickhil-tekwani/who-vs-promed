Vets probe Gwembe animal disease
-----------------------------------------
The government has sent a team of veterinary officers to Gwembe, in
Southern Province, to investigate a mysterious cattle disease that has
broken out in the area.
Agriculture Minister Mundia Sikatana said, in an interview in Lusaka on 7
Jul 2004, that the government could not ignore reports of such a mysterious
disease which had, so far, claimed about 500 animals. The minister said the
cause of the disease was not yet known, but he expected a report from the
provincial agriculture officer before the end of this week [2nd week of Jul
2004]. "We have veterinary officers on site who are doing everything
possible to contain the disease, and I am sure [that], before the end of
the week, the cause of the disease shall be established," he said.
Mr. Sikatana said the mysterious disease had, so far, only been reported in
Gwembe, and his ministry would contain it to ensure that it did not spread
to other areas.

[The undiagnosed cattle deaths in Gwembe were initially published 3 months
ago (see ref). At that time, a local official "urged veterinary officers to
rush to the area and investigate the nature of the disease (manifested by
acute diarrhea) before the cattle population was wiped out". Hopefully, the
minister's expectations to establish the cause of the disease before the
end of the week are realistic; findings will be appreciated. - Mod.AS].
