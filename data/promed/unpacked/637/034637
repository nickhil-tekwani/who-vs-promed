Availability of New Rabies Vaccine for Human Use
On October 20, 1997, the Food and Drug Administration licensed a new rabies
vaccine for both pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylactic use in humans.
This purified chick embryo cell culture (PCEC) vaccine (RabAvert Ô )* is
manufactured by Chiron Behring GmbH and Company. The addition of PCEC to
the current products available for pre-exposure and post-exposure
prophylactic use in humans allows for greater flexibility in treatment
choices for the vaccination candidate who develops a sensitivity to one of
the other available vaccines. Although derived from chick embryo cells,
antibodies to chick cell proteins were not detected in recipients of the
vaccine.
Before introduction of the PCEC vaccine, two other products were licensed
for use as rabies vaccines in the United States: human diploid cell vaccine
(HDCV) and rabies vaccine adsorbed (RVA). HDCV uses the Pitman Moore strain
of fixed rabies virus propagated in infected human diploid cells, and RVA
uses a Kissling strain of rabies virus adapted to a diploid cell line of
fetal rhesus lung.
The PCEC vaccine has been shown to be safe and immunogenic when the current
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices guidelines are employed. These
guidelines are as follows: pre-exposure vaccination for persons not
previously vaccinated consists of three 1.0-mL doses delivered
intramuscularly in the deltoid region for adults and in the anterolateral
zone of the thigh for young children on days 0, 7, and 21 or 28 (day 0
indicates the start of treatment); post-exposure vaccination with PCEC in
persons not previously vaccinated consists of five 1.0 ml doses delivered
intramuscularly in the same regions as for pre-exposure vaccination on days
0, 3, 7, 14, and 28, plus one dose of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG)
at 20 IU per kg of body weight on day 0. As much as possible of the full
dose of HRIG should be thoroughly infiltrated into and around the wound(s).
Any remaining volume should be administered intramuscularly at a site
distant from the vaccine inoculation.
Post-exposure prophylaxis for those persons who have been previously
vaccinated should consist of two 1.0 ml doses delivered intramuscularly, in
the same regions as previously stated for adults and children, on days 0
and 3. HRIG should not be administered to previously vaccinated persons.
On the basis of information provided by the manufacturer RabAvert Ô is a
sterile freeze-dried vaccine obtained by growing the fixed-virus strain
Flury low egg passage (LEP) in primary cultures of chicken fibroblasts. The
tissue culture fluid is harvested and filtered to remove cell debris. The
virus is inactivated with b-propiolactone, then further purified and
concentrated by zonal centrifugation. The vaccine is lyophilized after
addition of a stabilizer solution in 1.0 ml amounts, which supplies at
least 2.5 IU of rabies antigen. No preservative is contained in the
vaccine, and the vaccine should be used immediately after reconstitution.
The vaccine is designed for intramuscular use only. The manufacturer also
reported the occurrence of a substantial anamnestic antibody response with
no reports of IgE-mediated hypersensitivity when PCEC was used as a
booster, regardless of the vaccine used for primary vaccination.
As with the other available products (HDCV and RVA), local reactions such
as swelling, induration, and reddening have been associated with
administration of PCEC. Because the product contains trace amounts of
animal by-products, antibiotics, and human serum albumin, systemic allergic
reactions are possible and have been reported.
