New Caledonia chikungunya outbreak linked to Indonesia
------------------------------------------------------
New Caledonia has stemmed the spread of the mosquitoborne [virus]
disease chikungunya, which had health organisations on alert earlier
this year. In March [2011], the 1st case of the disease to ever be
found in the Pacific was detected in Noumea. There have now been 32
other confirmed cases, prompting the government to introduce new
measures to fight the disease. Since then the spread of the disease
has slowed.

[It is gratifying to learn that the outbreak is slowing, with an
increase of 6 cases since 25 May 2011. One hopes that vector mosquito
control measures will be successful and the outbreak will end soon.

In a previous ProMED-mail post on the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)
outbreak in New Caledonia (ProMED-mail archive no 20110511.1446), Dr
Myrielle Dupont-Rouzeyrol and colleagues stated, "In New Caledonia,
the putative vector of CHIKV is _Aedes aegypti_ since _Ae. albopictus_
has never been described there. ... Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate
that this viral isolate belongs to the Asia lineage, which
corroborates the Indonesian origin of the imported cases (ProMED-mail
archive no 20110226.0631)."
