France has warned there could be no Christmas Eve oyster supper next
year [2011]. The traditional French Christmas and New Year's Eve
supper of oysters is under threat as a mystery disease has decimated
the shellfish population.

Oyster prices have risen by up to 50 per cent to reach 15 British
pounds [USD 23.00] per dozen in some areas, making the delicacy far
more expensive this year [2010] for French families still recovering
from the economic crisis.

However, scientists are warning that the epidemic is so virulent that
there may be no oysters left for next year's [2011] festive season.

So serious is the problem that French army marine scientists have
been drafted in to study the disease, which is killing billions of
baby oysters and threatening an entire industry on an unprecedented scale.

At Christmas and New Year's Eve, millions of French will pull corks
on chilled white wine and squeeze lemon or pour shallot vinegar into
around a billion oysters during long reveillon feasts.

The oysters eaten this Christmas are 3-year adults, the survivors of
a plague which started killing off baby shellfish at breeding sites
from the northern coast of Brittany to the Mediterranean Sea in the
spring of 2008.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshal

["Suspected: Herpesvirus OsHV-1 frequently associated with _Vibrio
splendidus_" was reported by France to the OIE during 2009; the
immediate notification, 3 follow-up reports (the last, 3rd, one
notifying that the event was resolved on 26 Nov 2009), and a map
showing all affected locations along France's Atlantic coasts, are
available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=8265>.

The following text, titled "Suspected: Herpes virus-1 OsHV frequently
associated with _Vibrio splendidus_, France," has been copied from
follow-up report No. 3, submitted to the OIE on 26 Nov 2009, from the said URL:

1. Background
An event involving abnormal mortality of Pacific oysters
(_Crassostrea gigas_), occurring since April 2009, has intensified
and seems to be affecting almost the entire coastline of metropolitan
France. Mortalities are affecting diploid and triploid oyster larvae
and spat, irrespective of their origin (natural or hatcheries). This
event is strictly an animal health issue, and there is no known
impact on public health.

2. Hypotheses on the origin
Summer mortality of Pacific oysters is a well-known phenomenon. The
causes appear to be based on a general model of multifactor
interactions involving the animal, its environment and infective
agents. In 2008, these mortalities reached the highest levels ever
encountered since Pacific oysters were 1st introduced along the
French coast. In 2009, mass die-offs are again observed in various
oyster farm areas. A series of studies is being carried out to
identify possible causes. Two main avenues of research are being
explored: the effects of the environment on oysters and the
involvement of infective agents. These 2 hypotheses are not mutually exclusive.

3. Measures taken
Based on the mortality rate observed, movement control measures are
imposed on Pacific oysters (oyster larvae and spat) coming from zones
and establishments where significant mortalities have been recorded.
Conditions for the lifting of these restriction measures are also
foreseen (a mortality rate below 15 percent obtained at 2 counts
conducted at an interval of at least 15 days).

4. Results of tests as of 10 Jul 2009
49 batches of Pacific oysters have been examined since 28 Apr [2009].
The IFREMER (French Research Institute for Exploration of the Sea)
(LGP: Genetics and Pathology Laboratory - La Tremblade) conducts
histological examinations, bacteriological analyses and molecular
analyses targeting bacteria of the species _Vibrio splendidus_ and
_V. aestuarianus_ and the virus OsHV-1. For the main bacterial
strains isolated from oysters and characterised as neither _V.
splendidus_ nor _V. aestuarianus_, sequencing was also carried out.
As of 10 Jul [2009], the results are as follows:

- No officially notifiable infective agents were detected in the 35
samples subjected to histological examination.

- OsHV-1 virus was detected in 30 of the 32 samples tested.
Sequencing studies were carried out on the positive samples to look
for the presence of a specific viral genotype (detected in France for
the 1st time during episodes of mortality in 2008). This genotype was
found in the 11 samples (pooled individuals) subjected to test to
date. Sequencing of PCR products is planned for all batches testing
positive for the OsHV-1 virus.

- _Vibrio splendidus_ bacteria were found in 22 of the 46 samples
(analyses carried out on the main bacterial strains isolated).

- _Vibrio aestuarianus_ bacteria were identified in 5 of the 46
samples (analyses carried out on the main bacterial strains isolated).

- Bacteria identified as belonging to the species _Vibrio harveyi_
were detected in a (Mediterranean) batch.

- Bacteria identified as belonging to the species _Vibrio tapetis_,
the causative agent of brown ring disease of clams, were detected in
5 batches (Aquitaine et Charente Maritime region).

- To date, no bacteria have been identified as belonging to the
species _Vibrio tubiashii_ in any of the batches that have undergone
sequencing. - Mod.AS]
