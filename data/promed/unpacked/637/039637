Ebola virus disease, West Africa -- update
------------------------------------------
Guinea
------
The overall Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Guinea continues to improve. No new alerts, cases, nosocomial transmission have been reported from 5 out of the 6 affected prefectures since 26 Apr 2014. Gueckedou remains the only hotspot where community transmission and deaths are still being reported. Surveillance and social mobilization have been intensified to stop community transmission.

As of 18:00 on 18 May 2014, the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Guinea has reported a cumulative total of 253 clinical cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD), including 176 deaths. Since the last update of 12 May 2014, there have been 6 new cases confirmed by ebolavirus PCR and 5 new deaths among the confirmed cases bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 144, including 97 deaths. There have been no changes in the number of suspected cases (42 cases, 22 deaths) and probable cases (67 cases, 57 deaths).

The geographical distribution of the clinical cases of EVD since the beginning of the outbreak is as follows: Conakry (50 cases, including 25 deaths), Gueckedou (168/123), Macenta (22/17), Kissidougou (8/6), Dabola (4/4), and Djinguiraye (1/1). The cumulative total of laboratory confirmed cases and deaths since the beginning of the outbreak is: Conakry (40 cases, including 20 deaths); Gueckedou (89/65); Macenta (12/10); Kissidougou (2/1); and Dabola (1/1).

Since the isolation of the last reported cases in Djinguiraye, Dabola and Kissidougou, 2 incubation periods (42 days) have passed. In Macenta, there have been no new cases since 9 Apr 2014 and Conakry since 26 Apr 2014. In Gueckedou, the date of isolation of the most recent cases is 15 May 2014.

The number of cases remains subject to change due to reclassification, retrospective investigation, consolidation of cases and laboratory data, enhanced surveillance activities, and contact tracing activities.

Liberia and Sierra Leone
------------------------
In Liberia and Sierra Leone, the situation is stable. In Liberia, the date of isolation of the most recent case is 9 Apr 2014. It is therefore projected that EVD outbreak could be declared over on 22 May 2014. Harmonization of data has brought the total number of EVD cases to 12, including 9 deaths. Surveillance activities have been enhanced in districts bordering Guinea.

WHO response
------------
WHO continues to support coordination, resource mobilisation and advocacy, development of proposals, and implementation of epidemic preparedness and response plans. WHO is monitoring closely the needs for human capacity and logistics on the ground. Deployments of different experts under WHO/GOARN and capacity building of local experts to stop community transmission in Gueckedou are ongoing. A large range of medical supplies, including personal protective equipment (PPE) have been distributed.

WHO is also supporting the planning for evaluation of EVD outbreak in West Africa.

WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea or Liberia based on the current information available for this event.
