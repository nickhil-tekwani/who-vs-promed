Wasting disease shows up in Kent County deer
--------------------------------------------
A whitetail deer born and culled from a Kent County [Michigan] deer farm
has chronic wasting disease (CWD), state wildlife officials announced on
Monday [25 Aug 2008]. It is the 1st time the fatal neurological disease has
turned up in Michigan. Its presence is triggering big changes for hunters
and deer farm owners.

"It's triggering bait and feeding restrictions for whitetail deer in all of
the Lower Peninsula, and carcass handling restrictions in the hot zone,"
said Becky Humphries, the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) director.
Hunters who kill deer this fall from Tyrone, Solon, Nelson, Sparta, Algoma,
Courtland, Alpine, Plainfield, and Cannon townships will be required to
bring their deer to DNR check stations. Other hunters will be strongly
encouraged to do so.

To date, there is no indication that any wild, free-ranging deer has the
disease. The 3 year old female doe with CWD is the 1st reported case in
Michigan.

Deer farms all over the state also are being quarantined. There are 580 in
total, including breeding farms, hobby and exhibition facilities, and
ranches where the deer are hunted.

In West Michigan, there are 6 farms of concern, the Kent County facility
where the sick deer was found and 5 others in Osceola and Montcalm
counties, which did business with the other farm. Don Koivisto, the
director for the Michigan Department of Agriculture, said 5 facilities were
quarantined over the weekend [23-24 Aug 2008]. Their records are being
examined to trace the sale and transfer of deer. The facilities' names were
withheld pending further investigation.

Michigan's 1st case of chronic wasting disease detected
-------------------------------------------------------
The Michigan departments of agriculture (MDA) and natural resources (DNR)
today [25 Aug 2008] confirmed the state's 1st case of chronic wasting
disease (CWD) in a 3 year old white-tailed deer from a privately owned
cervid (POC) facility in Kent County.

The state has quarantined all POC facilities, prohibiting the movement of
all -- dead or alive -- privately owned deer, elk, or moose. Officials do
not yet know how the deer may have contracted the disease. To date, there
is no evidence that CWD presents a risk to humans.

DNR and MDA staff are currently reviewing records from the Kent County
facility and 5 others to trace deer that have been purchased, sold, or
moved by the owners in the last 5 years for deer and the last 7 years for
elk. Any deer that may have come in contact with the CWD-positive herd have
been traced to their current location and those facilities have been
quarantined.

"Michigan's veterinarians and wildlife experts have been working throughout
the weekend [23-24 Aug 2008] to complete their investigation," said Don
Koivisto, MDA director. "We take this disease very seriously, and are using
every resource available to us to implement response measures and stop the
spread of this disease."

CWD is a fatal neurological disease that affects deer, elk, and moose. Most
cases of the disease have been in western states, but in the past several
years, it has spread to some Midwestern and eastern states. Infected
animals display abnormal behaviors, progressive weight loss, and physical
debilitation.

Current evidence suggests that the disease is transmitted through
infectious, self-multiplying proteins (prions) contained in saliva and
other fluids of infected animals. Susceptible animals can acquire CWD by
direct exposure to these fluids or also from contaminated environments.
Once contaminated, research suggests that soil can remain a source of
infection for long periods of time, making CWD a particularly difficult
disease to eradicate.

"Currently, one of our top concerns is to confirm that the disease is not
in free-ranging deer," said DNR director Rebecca Humphries. "We are asking
hunters this fall [2008] to assist us by visiting check stations to allow
us to take biological samples from the deer they harvest, so we can perform
adequate surveillance of the free-ranging white-tailed deer herd in the area."

Deer hunters this fall [2008] who take deer from Tyrone, Soldon, Nelson,
Sparta, Algoma, Courtland, Alpine, Plainfield, and Cannon townships will be
required to bring their deer to a DNR check station. Deer taken in these
townships are subject to mandatory deer check.

The DNR is also asking hunters who are participating in the private land
5-day antlerless hunt in September [2008] in other parts of Kent County to
visit DNR check stations in Kent County so further biological samples can
be taken from free-ranging deer for testing. The DNR is in the process of
finding additional locations for check stations in Kent County to make it
more convenient for hunters.

The deer that tested positive at the Kent County facility was a doe that
had been recently culled by the owner of the facility. Michigan law
requires sick deer or culled deer on a POC facility be tested for disease.
The samples from the Kent County deer tested "suspect positive" last week
[week of 18 Aug 2008] at Michigan State University Diagnostic Center for
Population and Animal Health, and were sent to the National Veterinary
Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa, last Thursday [21 Aug 2008] for
confirmatory testing. The positive results of those tests were communicated
to the state of Michigan today [25 Aug 2008].

Audits of the facility by the DNR in 2004 and 2007 showed no escapes of
animals from the Kent County facility were reported by the owner. Also,
there were no violations of regulations recorded during the audits.

Since 2002, the DNR has tested 248 wild deer in Kent County for CWD. In
summer 2005, a number of those deer had displayed determined the deer had
contracted eastern equine encephalitis.

[Michigan has had TB (tuberculosis) in deer and cattle and now has CWD in
farmed cervids. Clearly they will be doing their epidemiology
investigation. Indiana should be on the alert as this is a trans boundary
disease. - Mod.TG
