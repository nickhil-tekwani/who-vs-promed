State regulators found that samples from 16 of 17 ice cream flavors from the Big Olaf Creamery production facility in Sarasota County [Florida] tested positive for the _Listeria_ bacteria, prompting a formal stop sales order by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services late Friday [15 Jul 2022].

The products had already been part of a voluntary recall, and agency spokeswoman Erin Moffet said in a statement that the department "continues to work closely with our state and federal partners on this investigation and enforcement of the stop sale."

The flavors that tested positive were blueberry cheesecake, butter pecan, cherry cordial, chocolate, cookie dough, chocolate chip, coconut, coconut almond joy, cookies & cream, kahlua krunch, mint chip, pistachio, plantation praline, Superman, vanilla, and white chocolate raspberry.

The Department of Agriculture had also sampled equipment at the facility and had released those results earlier this week, saying that 9 of 100 samples had tested positive for the bacteria that causes listeriosis, a deadly foodborne illness that infects about 1600 people per year. Another outstanding sample that was taking a while to produce a result also came back positive, bringing the total number of positive samples to 10, Moffet said.

The news of positive product samples comes almost 2 weeks after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first linked a _Listeria_ outbreak to Big Olaf Creamery's ice cream. Despite warnings from the public health agency, however, the company's production facility initially dismissed the claims as "only speculation," and several Big Olaf retail locations continued to sell the product.

The CDC says 23 illnesses have been reported, with 22 hospitalizations and one death, though officials acknowledge the actual number is probably higher. The people affected have been from 10 states. No new illnesses have been reported since 30 Jun [2022]. It wasn't until the company issued a recall on Fri 8 Jul that all Big Olaf retailers were required to return ice cream to the production plant.

According to the CDC website, the recalled ice cream has been sold at or served at Big Olaf retailers, restaurants, and senior homes in Florida and in one location in Fredericksburg, Ohio.

All flavors, lots, and expiration dates through 30 Jun 2022 of Big Olaf brand ice cream products have been recalled. The ice cream was sold to consumers in plastic pint-size containers and plastic half-gallon containers, the CDC says. The ice cream was sold to independent retail stores in plastic 2.5 gallon scoopable tubs.

Big Olaf Creamery's Cattlemen Road production facility has been sued twice since the outbreak started: once regarding the death of an Illinois woman whose family said she contracted a deadly case of _Listeria_ after eating its ice cream, and another time in the illness of a Massachusetts woman who claimed that eating Big Olaf's ice cream caused her to miscarry. Legal experts say shops that continued to sell the product after the CDC warning went out could subject them to even further liability.

Listeriosis causes about 260 deaths per year in the US, according to the CDC. The bacterium is not something health inspectors find in routine check-ups, so it's on businesses to have strong environmental monitoring programs to check for it, scientific experts have said. It can come into a facility through unpasteurized milk, fruit, or nuts and it can live indefinitely until it's discovered and dealt with. Once discovered, it can be hard to clean, because it gets into the nooks and crannies of machines. A combination of scrubbing and proper chemicals has to be used to get it out, experts have said.

The Department of Agriculture collected samples 5 Jul [2022] from the Big Olaf production facility, from which ice cream is distributed to independently owned Big Olaf licensed locations and to other retail partners, like Twistee Treat in North Fort Myers and Beverly's Ice Cream in Clearwater Beach.

The CDC warned the anyone who has the recalled Big Olaf Creamery ice cream at home to throw it away and clean any areas, containers, and serving utensils that may have touched recalled ice cream. Businesses are advised to "clean and disinfect any areas and equipment that may have touched recalled ice cream products, including ice cream scoops and other serving utensils."

According to the CDC, _Listeria_ is most likely to sicken pregnant people and their newborns, adults aged 65 or older, and people with weakened immune systems. Other people can be infected with _Listeria_, but they rarely become seriously ill.

The CDC said 12 of the sick people reported are residents of Florida, and 9 said they traveled to Florida before getting sick. "Illnesses started on dates ranging from [24 Jan 2021] through [12 Jun 2022]," a summary of the CDC investigation says. Those sickened range in age from less under 1 year old to 92 years. Five people got sick during their pregnancies, and one person's illness resulted in a fetal loss, the agency said. Recent illnesses may not have been reported yet because of the lag time in determining if a person who's sick is part of the outbreak.

"Public health officials continue to interview people about the foods they ate before they got sick," the CDC said. "...Seven ill people were identified as part of 3 illness clusters in this outbreak. An illness cluster is defined as 2 or more people who do not live in the same household who report eating food from the same retail location before becoming ill. "If several unrelated ill people ate food from the same retail location, it suggests that the contaminated food item was served or sold there. All 3 illness clusters were at retail locations that sell Big Olaf Creamery ice cream."

[As of 15 Jul 2022, the total case count remained at 23 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ in 10 US states. No new illnesses have been reported since 30 Jun 2022.

More of the infected people in this outbreak than initially remembered eating ice cream, and in those who remembered details about the type of ice cream they ate, more people remember eating Big Olaf Creamery brand ice cream or eating ice cream at locations that might have been supplied by Big Olaf Creamery. The company issued a recall on Fri 8 Jul [2022] that all Big Olaf retailers were required to return ice cream to the production plant.

Now we learn that samples of Big Olaf ice cream, as well as samples obtained from equipment at the creamery facility, are culture positive for _Listeria_. _L. monocytogenes_ can form biofilms, which enable the organism to attach to solid surfaces and become extremely difficult to remove, especially in parts of food-processing equipment that may be difficult to access.

At this point, we are awaiting results of whole-gene sequencing (WGS) of the ice cream and equipment isolates to see if they match that of the outbreak strain. - Mod.ML
