After a gap of 11 years, glanders, an equine infection that has a high mortality rate among horses, has been reported in Maharashtra.

Kantilal Umap, commissioner, Animal Husbandry department, said positive cases of the disease have been identified in Ahmednagar, Thane, Akola and Satara, and 4 horse deaths have been recorded.

A veterinarian associated with the Pune Race Course said: "The disease is commonly found in horses and mules. Stopping transportation of animals is the most effective method to stop the infection from spreading."

The 1st positive case was found in April 2017, when one of the samples taken from Ahmednagar during routine sample collection confirmed the presence of the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_, the pathogen causing the disease. Since then, samples from Thane, Akola and Satara's Panchgani have tested positive.

The symptoms include nodules and ulcers on the skin and severe coughing, among others. In some cases, the affected animal dies within a few days, while in others, infected animals can live for years, spreading the infection further. Contaminated feed and water is a major mode through which the infection spreads.

There is no vaccine to prevent this disease. Proper disposal of the carcass is recommended to stop the infection from spreading further.

Glanders was last reported in Maharashtra in 2006. On measures being taken to contain the spread of the disease, Umap said the surveillance of animals within a 5-km radius of the infected animals has been increased. More than 1500 samples have been collected, and a close watch is being kept on the movement of animals, he said. Horse owners whose animals have tested positive are being medically examined.

The news of the infection comes at the start of the racing season in July 2017. Khushroo N Dhunjibhoy, member of the managing committee of the Royal Western India Turf Club Limited, said they had received information about cases of glanders from the Animal Husbandry Commission.

"Our horses are all stationed in Pune and generally do not travel outside," he said. Dhunjibhoy said that they ensure health certification of horses before they are allowed in Pune and to date, there has been no case of glanders in the race course.

In the last few years, sporadic outbreaks of the disease have been reported from Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Rajasthan. Last year [2016], the disease caused the deaths of 57 animals across India.

[_Burkholderia mallei_, the causative agent of glanders, is endemic in India, Brazil, and many other countries. It typically affects equid species including horses, donkeys, and mules. Clinical signs include nodules and ulcerations in the upper respiratory tract, and often death in affected animals; "farcy" is the skin form of the disease. The disease is highly contagious and rarely zoonotic. Test and remove programs have been used to eradicate the disease in many areas, but there is currently no vaccine against the disease. There are currently efforts underway to identify vaccine targets, although all research on the pathogen requires BSL3 facilities. - Mod.JH
