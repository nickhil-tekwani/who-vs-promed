More than 80 Russian tourists vacationing at the Sheraton Sharm
Resort in Egypt are believed to be suffering from food poisoning, a
Moscow radio station said on Monday [15 Sep 2008], citing one of the
victims. The Ekho Moskvy radio station said it is not clear what
caused the poisoning, but the tourists believe they fell ill after
consuming contaminated food.

"The tourists are suffering from the same symptoms: diarrhea,
stomachaches, nausea, vomiting," Gleb Borisov told Ekho Moskvy. "Some
of them have been unable to leave their hotel rooms for a 3rd day
already, although some are feeling a little better now." Borisov said
that no major medical assistance had been given to the tourists, with
hotel management reluctant to address the problem, advising the
victims to contact their insurance companies.

Russia's honorary consul to the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm
el-Sheikh, Akhmed Semari, told RIA Novosti that the hotel management
had denied there were any health issues at the resort. Semari said,
citing the hotel, that 6 Russian tourists had been taken to an
international medical clinic on Sunday [14 Sep 2008], adding that the
results of tests would be available later on Monday.

The 4-star Sheraton Sharm Hotel currently has around 600 tourists
staying, he said. Russian operators have meanwhile suspended sales to
the hotel until Egyptian health officials clear up the cause of the
poisoning, a spokesperson for the Russian Tourist Industry
Association said. "Some 100 tourists lodged complaints with their
insurance companies over the weekend," Irina Tyurina said. "Sales of
tours to the hotel have been suspended, and tourists who bought
holidays at the hotel will be accommodated in other hotels." She said
Russian tourists are being relocated to other hotels.

The Russian Tourist Industry Association said earlier that 2 million
Russians were expected to visit Egypt this year [2008] compared with
1.5 million in 2007. The country is a popular travel destination
during the fall and winter months with Russians due to the country's
simplified visa regime, warm climate, good diving and archaeological sites.

[The features of this outbreak, such as the mildness of the
condition, the absence of fever and the predominance of
gastrointestinal symptoms, are consistent with norovirus infection.

The duration of illness is probably too long for staphylococcal or
clostridial food poisoning. Further information is awaited.
