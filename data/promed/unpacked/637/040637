A team of epidemiologists and scientists are trying to determine how
a laboratory rabbit used as part of a research project at the
University of New Mexico was exposed to a wild strain of anthrax.

Sam Giammo is a spokesman for UNM's Health Sciences Center. He says
the anthrax found in the rabbit occurs naturally in the soil in New
Mexico and is not a public health threat.

The state Department of Health announced today [16 Nov 2007] that a
tissue sample from the rabbit that died Monday [12 Nov 2007] tested
positive for anthrax, which can be passed from animal to human
[Wrong: Anthrax is essentially non-contagious. - Mod.MHJ]. Health
officials say 2 employees who performed the necropsy were given
antibiotics as a precaution.

Giammo says about 20 UNM lab workers also will be given antibiotics.

[This doesn't make sense on a number of levels. Laboratory animals
should not be exposed to _Bacillus anthracis_ except through
purposeful and documented exposure. Then, it states that it came down
with a "wild strain" occurring naturally in New Mexico without
further definition. Does this mean that they are doing anthrax
experiments and, upon genotyping the recovered isolate, it was not
the "laboratory" strain it should have been? Or, are they carelessly
using a mixed culture? If the rabbit isolate is "local," it is
probably comparable to a recent outbreak in 1998 at Wagon Mound near
the Colorado border involving cattle and horses; otherwise this
disease has been infrequently reported in New Mexico during the past
decade or so. Wagon Mound has mollic/steppe soils and is thus
suitable for spore survival, but this is not to say that they do have
active cattle grave sites, though reading the 1997-98 reports below
may certainly suggest it.

Rabbits are fed hay as part of their routine diet, and it might be
that this hay was contaminated with soil; hay may also be a component
in their pelleted feed. If so, the UNM HSC should examine their
purchasing habits, as such soil-contaminated hay is usually of
obviously poor quality. And if "hay" is to blame, other hay from that
field will have been sold elsewhere and may be causing livestock
deaths as yet unreported.

Clarification is being sought from various folk in New Mexico. - Mod.MHJ]
