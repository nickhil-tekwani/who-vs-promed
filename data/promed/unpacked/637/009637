[Kentucky has announced it intends to ban products from Texas until this
issue is resolved. The area in Texas where this has occurred is very
remote, and could be described as "in the middle of nowhere." Part of
solving the mystery will be understanding how -- without additions to the
premises -- this virus appears. - Mod.TG]
