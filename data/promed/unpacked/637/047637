India: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update
---------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in India has informed WHO that no
human cases of H5N1 infection have been detected to date. Tests conducted on
samples taken from persons under investigation and their close contacts have
yielded no positive results as of today.
Testing has been undertaken at the National Institute of Virology in Pune and
the National Institute of Communicable Diseases in Delhi.
It was not clear if samples from a 27-year-old poultry worker from Gujarat
State, said to have died of respiratory disease on 17 Feb 2006, were among
those tested.
In India, as in all countries experiencing their first outbreaks of highly
pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza, WHO strongly recommends that patient samples
be sent to a WHO collaborating laboratory for diagnostic confirmation.
Certainty about the status of human cases in a newly affected country is
important for accurate risk assessment.

In addition, analyses conducted by WHO-approved laboratories can yield
information about the possible evolution of the virus and clues about how the
virus may have arrived in the country. Genetic and antigenic studies of
circulating viruses also help ensure that work on the development of a
pandemic vaccine stays on track.

Indian authorities on Thursday [23 Feb 2006] cleared [of suspected H5N1
infection] 11 out of 12 people quarantined following an H5N1 outbreak in
chickens.
In India, where hundreds of millions of people live in rural areas side-by-
side with livestock and domestic fowl, the risk of human infection -- which
comes from direct contact with an infected bird [or its excreta. - Mod. JW] --
is deemed higher than in other countries. So far there have been no human
cases in India, but authorities were carrying out tests on a dozen people
quarantined with suspected bird flu in Navapur, a remote town in India's
western Maharashtra state. 11 of the 12 had tested negative but the 12th was
undergoing further tests.
So far there have been no cases of human-to-human transmission of the virus
anywhere.
