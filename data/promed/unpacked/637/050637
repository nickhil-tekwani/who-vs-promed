No less than 38 cases of monkeypox have been laboratory confirmed in 8 states of the federation. The affected states are Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Delta, Edo, Ekiti, Enugu, Lagos, Rivers, and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).

A total of 116 suspected cases were recorded from 20 states and the FCT; since the onset of the outbreak, even as no death attributable to monkeypox has been recorded so far.

Announcing the development in its Situation Report 006 dated 2 Nov 2007, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) said a total of 103 samples have been collected and sent to National Reference Laboratory (NRL), Lagos for testing. According to the report, 21 states including the FCT have reported at least one suspected case; 59 contacts have exited after the mandatory 21-day follow-up while 145 contacts are still under follow up. The report noted that the male to female ratio is 2:1 while the most affected age group is 21-40 years [median 31]. Rapid response teams have been deployed to Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Delta, and Enugu to support outbreak response while all other suspected cases reported from other states are being investigated. The NCDC said public awareness activities have been intensified while laboratory testing capacity has been established in the National Reference Laboratory, Abuja.

[Monkeypox virus infections have now been confirmed in 38 cases in 8 states. If the confirmation of the monkeypox cases is further supported by additional positive tests done in the National Reference Laboratory in Lagos, this is an unusually widespread outbreak of the disease. It would be of interest to know if there is evidence of a monkeypox outbreak in these states in rodents that are the suspected reservoirs. As noted in previous posts, the main reservoirs of monkeypox virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp; an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_).
